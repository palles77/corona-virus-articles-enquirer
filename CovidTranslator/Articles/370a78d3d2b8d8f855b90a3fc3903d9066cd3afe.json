They can also be spread to other athletes, putting them at risk for similar disease and complications. The sports medicine physician may face challenging issues regarding infectious diseases when dealing with teams or highly competitive athletes who have difficulties taking time off to recover. One must treat the individual sick athlete and take the necessary precautions to contain the spread of communicable disease to the surrounding team, staff, relatives, and other contacts.",

            "text": "The authors aim to translate recommendations in public health to practice in a sports medicine setting. Sports physicians have an opportunity to see athletes during adolescence and adulthood who might not come in for routine health maintenance except when related to their sports. Primary prevention of infectious disease, the ideal goal, deals with avoiding the development of the disease before infection occurs. Immunizations are an example of primary prevention and have been the most successful public health programs for disease prophylaxis. Secondary prevention for infection control involves prevention of spread to others. Athletes are often exposed to many different people, travel to compete in various environments locally and internationally, and engage in higher-risk activities, often in close contact with others [2] . The authors discuss the preventive strategies for infectious disease in sport, including (1) a review of immunization recommendations and prophylaxis guidelines, (2) improvements in personal hygiene and prevention of spread of infectious organisms by direct contact, (3) insect-borne disease precautions, and (4) prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). A special emphasis on immunizations focuses on pertussis, influenza, and meningococcal prophylaxis. Athletes may share personal items (eg, towels, water bottles, and soap) and equipment (eg, weights). They may live in dormitories or in hotel rooms while traveling, which leads to close contact and high exposure to teammates. They participate in higher-risk activities [2, 11] . Fewer athletes practice safe sex, which can lead to STDs in homosexual and in heterosexual individuals. Athletes also use more illicit drugs and alcohol, which can place them at risk of intravenous needle exposure [12, 13] . Steroids, hormones, and vitamins are other substances that some athletes are injecting [14, 15] . Tattoos are popular among athletes, which are another source of needle infection risk.",

Immunogenicity is determined by hemaglutinins and neuraminidases on the virus surface. Antigenic drift can occur that can mutate the virus into different strains. Transmission occurs by way of respiratory droplets. The virus has an incubation period of usually 2 days (range, 1-4 days), and adults are infectious from the day before symptoms begin to approximately 5 days after the illness starts [9] . Symptoms usually last a week, although less likely, symptoms can last longer than 2 weeks. These symptoms can be very disruptive for treatment and challenging for the athlete to keep training and competing. A case series of 81 students, mostly healthy adolescents at a ski school in Austria, reported a severe outbreak of influenza A, leading to an attack rate of 49%, with 69% becoming ill within 2 days of the outbreak.

Live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is approved for use in healthy, nonpregnant individuals aged 5 to 49 years. The LAIV is administered by way of a nasal spray once in each nostril (FluMist, manufactured by MedImmune). Individuals who have a hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction to components of the flu vaccine or to eggs should not be vaccinated [9] . Adults reported having a 19% reduction in severe febrile illnesses after LAIV compared with placebo [38] . Side effects from LAIV increased in adults within 7 days of immunization compared with placebo and consisted mainly of nasal congestion (44.5% versus 27.1%) and sore throat (27.8% versus 17.1%), which lasted, on average, 2 days. Less common complaints were tiredness, cough, and chills. There was no significant difference in the number of mild febrile illnesses between immunization and placebo groups [39] .

Therefore, sports medicine physicians may be faced with higher frequency of checking for meningococcal immunization status for high school and college athletes. A tetravalent conjugate vaccine (Menactra, Sanofi Pasteur) is available against Neisseria meningitidis isolates A, C, Y, and W-135 in a 0.5-mL single-dose vial. Over the age of 11 years, 75% of the meningococcal infections are caused by strains C, Y, or W-135 (CDC, unpublished data, 2004) [50] . Another vaccine, Menomune (Aventis Pasteur Limited), has been licensed since 1981 and has a similar immunogenicity profile to Menactra and is delivered subcutaneously as a 0.5-mL dose. Menactra and Menomune have serum bactericidal protection ranging from 89.4% and 94.4% for strain W-135 and 73.5% and 79.4% for strain Y, respectively [50] . Revaccination may be necessary for individuals at high risk after 5 years [52, 53] . Common side effects with MCV4 were local pain in just over 50% of patients, followed by swelling, induration, and redness in approximately 10.8% to 17.1%. Fever was reported in 5.1% of children 18 years old or younger and in 1.5% of adults [50] .",

Their season is usually from April to September, but they can present throughout the year. Newer rickettsial diseases are emerging.

The presentation most often manifests as a sudden febrile illness with headache, myalgia, and a maculopapular rash that spreads in a centripetal pattern. Rickettsia rickettsii has a predilection for endothelial cells and can cause a diffuse vasculitis and an untreated mortality of 10%. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, with epidemiologic, geographic, and seasonal considerations. Laboratory testing may be supportive with thrombocytopenia and mild liver enzyme elevation. Serologic testing is supportive only on a delayed basis with acute and convalescent titers. Human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis and human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis can also present with acute headache, fever, and myalgia. Laboratory evaluation often demonstrates leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and transaminase elevation. Common tick-borne illnesses that have been reported in the northeast United States are Lyme disease and babesiosis, which are transmitted by the tick Ixodes scapularis [66] . Babesiosis can cause a febrile illness and possibly life-threatening anemia and thrombocytopenia. Lyme disease is a rickettsial disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. As such, concurrent disease may be caused by the same tick bite (see Table 4 ).",

Widening woodland trails andkeeping in the center of the trail while walking may be helpful. When traveling in wooded areas, light-colored clothing is helpful to identify the tick. Long pants tucked into tightly woven socks and closed shoes minimize exposure. Deet at 10% to 25% should be applied to the skin. Permethrin may be applied only to the clothing. Clothes should be removed and cleaned and dried after exposure. The clothes dryer is effective in killing ticks. One should carefully check for ticks in the nymphal phase that may be the size of a pin head. Careful inspection should be done of the hair, ears, axilla, belly button, and legs. Children and pets should also be checked. It is also important to monitor pets that may travel in the woods and return indoors.",
