Movement of animals between farms is one of the most significant routes of disease transmission and is particularly hard to control for pathogens with subclinical infection. Renibacterium salmoninarum causes bacterial kidney disease (BKD) in salmonid fish, but infection is often sub-clinical and may go undetected with major potential implications for disease control programmes. A Susceptible-Infected model of R. salmoninarum in Scottish aquaculture has been developed that subdivides the infected phase between known and undetected sub-clinically infected farms and diseased farms whose status is assumed to be known. Farms officially known to be infected are subject to movement controls restricting spread of infection. Model results are sensitive to prevalence of undetected infection, which is unknown. However, the modelling suggests that controls that reduce BKD prevalence include improve biosecurity on farms, including those not known to be infected, and improved detection of infection. Culling appears of little value for BKD control. BKD prevalence for rainbow trout farms is less sensitive to controls than it is for Atlantic salmon farms and so different management strategies may be required for the sectors.",

One important activity for spreading disease is the movement of animals between farms (F\u00e8vre et al., 2006) , such movements are extensive in many production systems, both in terms of the numbers of and the distances that animals are moved . Targeted controls on the spread of disease aim to prevent transmission from infected sites by imposing movement controls on them and, in more extreme cases, culling animals, which also prevents transmission to other farms through the environment. Uninfected farms may improve biosecurity and limit inputs when aware of the presence of a potential disease problem, conversely farms whose operators are confident that risk is low, because probability or consequence of infection is low, may relax their biosecurity and welfare measures (Hennessy, 2007) .",

            "text": "Imposition of targeted controls requires knowledge of the distribution of a pathogen. Diseased animals frequently exhibit clinical signs that indicate presence of the pathogen by visual inspection and so allow passive reporting of problems by farmers who are in daily contact with their animals. Confirmation of the pathogen usually requires laboratory diagnostic testing, but action can be taken immediately on suspicion if deemed necessary. However, infections generally go through an incubation phase during which the host appears healthy. This subclinical infection may be short lived (e.g. foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV)) or last for a prolonged period (e.g. Myobacterium bovis the agent of bovine tuberculosis). Detection of infection during this phase requires an active programme of field sampling, often carried out by vets or official health inspectors. Such farm visits can also detect animals with clinical signs that have not been reported and allow inspectors to interact with farmers to improve passive reporting rates. Active sampling is necessarily limited by resources (Cannon, 2009 ) and risk-based surveillance allows populations at the greatest risk of receiving or transmitting infection to be targeted (St\u00e4rk et al., 2006) . A particularly useful form of risk-based surveillance is contact tracing of farms that have received or sent animals to a known infected farms (Eames and Keeling, 2003) . Delays in detection of infection can be disastrous, even the relatively short period before movement controls were imposed allowed FMDV to become spread to regions throughout Great Britain (GB) as a result of the movement of animals (Green et al., 2006) and the control of bovine tuberculosis spread in England and Wales is problematic due to the prolonged subclinical infection (Gilbert et al., 2005) .",

The epidemiology of BKD in Scotland reviewed in detail by Murray et al. (2011) and Wallace et al. (2011) is summarised in the following text, and this epidemiology informs the basis of the model structure described subsequently. We use the modelling to explore the role of this subclinical infection on the response of BKD prevalence to alteration in model parameters; this analysis includes the effect of uncertainty as to the prevalence of subclinical infection on these responses. The model is used to investigate the effects of potential applied controls on BKD prevalence and thus identify strategies that control or reduce the current prevalence of disease. Ideally disease control strategies should be selected that balance costs of controls and impacts of disease (Peddie and Stott, 2003) , unfortunately we lack systematic costings of these and the modelling outputs are of use to aid policy decisions rather than to directly confirm optimal controls.",

The movement of fish between farms is an essential requirement of the production cycle, both biologically and economically. Fish are moved from hatcheries to ongrowing farms, and all salmon, and some trout, are moved from freshwater farms to marine farms as they smolt.

On report of suspicion, official fish health inspectors (FHI) visit the farm; in addition FHI routinely inspect all farms annually. Under the control regime that applied up until 2010 the FHI took samples from 150 fish at suspect sites, and, every other year, 30 fish from sites visited for routine inspection.

Analysis of these diagnostic methods indicated that although they are sensitive at detecting and specific at confirming R. salmoninarum in the presence of clinical BKD (Bruno et al., 2007) , both ELISA and culture have relatively poor sensitivity for confirmation of subclinical infection because bacterial colonies are few and localised in such fish (Austin and Rayment, 1985) . However, the R. salmoninarum qPCR is a considerably more sensitive test for subclinical infection . When low test sensitivity is combined with low levels of infection within infected populations and further reduced sensitivity in pooled samples, analysis shows that the routine sampling as practiced in Scotland up until 2010 was of negligible value in detecting subclinical infection .",

Movement of clinically disease fish is banned under welfare legislation. Previously, restrictions were lifted from a farm after 150 fish have tested negative on two occasions by ELISA by FHI, now only one sample of 150 fish by qPCR is required because of the greater sensitivity found for this test.

            "text": "The first ever report of BKD was in Scottish wild salmon and was referred to 'Dee disease' (Mackie et al., 1933; Smith, 1964) , BKD is a significant cause of wild fish mortality in other countries to this day (Fenichel et al., 2009) . However, BKD has not been reported from Scottish wild freshwater fish since the 1960s. Extensive ELISA screening of wild fish by FHI and researchers in Scotland since the 1960s has returned only negative results (for example 4520 wild freshwater fish were sampled between 1989 and 2004 alone ). In 2003 an ELISA positive was obtained from a single herring (Clupea harengus) taken from within a cage holding salmon with advanced clinical BKD (unpublished result). Recent qPCR sampling of 2703 Scottish freshwater fish gave positive results for two pools of stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), one pool of minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) and 3 (likely escaped) rainbow trout pools; the positive samples were obtained close to infected farms and none had signs of BKD . Low levels of infection were also found in England and Wales (40 by qPCR and 2 by culture out of 946 fish sampled) by Chambers et al. (2008) . These wild fish might sometimes act as a reservoir, particularly if R. salmoninarum were eradicated from farms. Given this low level of infection and its chronic nature it is reasonable to assume that BKD has little impact on Scottish wild fish populations and they have little role in BKD transmission between farms so it is reasonable not to include them explicitly in the model, although they may be relevant to parameter values concerned with transmission and persistence of infection and potential roles are noted when the model parameter values are considered. Given the low level of R. salmoninarum infection in Scottish wild fish, we do not include these in the modelling. The situation in Scotland is in contrast to North America, where the dynamics of BKD in managed wild salmonid populations have been modelled for the Great Lakes by Fenichel et al. (2009) and the Snake River in Washington State by Hamel (2001) .",

In this case the infected farms are subdivided into diseased (D) or sub-clinically infected farms. The sub-clinically infected farms are further divided into 'known' cases (K) and 'undetected' cases of infection (U) because targeted controls can only be imposed on known cases (Fig. 1) . The unit of population in this model is the farm; a farm with 1% and a farm with 90% of fish infected are both considered 'infected' farms. 'Prevalence', thus here refers to proportion of farms and 'level' to proportion of fish within a population that are infected or diseased. The population modelling is density independent with the variables representing the proportions of farms in each category and so S + U + D + K = 1. Fenichel et al. (2009) used similar categories (susceptible (S), exposed (U) and infectious (D)) to model wild fish with R. salmoninarum infection although these apply at the individual fish rather than the farm level. In their case there was no possibility of knowing the status of individual fish, nor any way to target management on infected fish should they be known, so they had no category equivalent to K. Taylor et al. (2011) used a similar approach to our model of S, I and C when modelling koi herpesvirus (KHV) in English and Welsh carp (Cyprinus carpio). They divided their infected population into controlled C and uncontrolled I farms, with only the latter spreading infection to susceptible S farms, so C = K + D in our model.",

Pathogen transmission leads to transformation from S to U (i.e. the subclinical infection in these populations is initially unknown, but see later for contact tracing). In the case of R. salmoninarum most transmission is likely to be through movements of fish ; movement controls, DAOs, are a key part of BKD controls (Munro, 2007) , which are applied where infection is officially known (K or D farms). So while some transmission may occur from D farms by bacteria are shed into the water, transmission of this pathogen is largely halted for D or K farms by imposition of DAOs.",

Some of these farms had clinical BKD (D), but others did not (K). In this initial section analyses for the entire industry are described (i.e. 2.5% prevalence, K* = D* = 0.0125), later we describe the model's implications for control policies within salmon (1%, K* = D* = 0.005) and trout (20%, K* = D* = 0.1) industries.

This use of an arbitrary time step means that we do not need to know the transmission coefficient over a given time, per day for example. As most transmission of R. salmoninarum appears to be associated with movement of fish between farms (Austin and Rayment, 1985; Murray et al., 2011) and current policy is to impose movement controls we assume there is no transmission from farms known to be infected but without disease,\u02c7K = 0. Note that movements can occur between infected farms without spreading infection, so an outright movement ban is not necessarily implied by\u02c7K = 0. Fish on clinically infected farms will shed bacteria into the water and so some transmission is possible (McKibben and Pascho, 1999) , this transmission includes any due to wild or escaped fish acting as vectors, but as noted earlier prevalence is very low . Under these movement controls water-borne transmission continues and to represent his\u02c7D = 0.04, equal to 20% of the transmission rate due to the transport of fish between farms (in the absence of movement controls\u02c7D = 0.24). Water-borne transmission is relatively weak for BKD, because R. salmoninarum does not survive well in water (Austin and Rayment, 1985) relative to other pathogens such as infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) (McAllister and Bebak, 1997) . The bacteria are associated with fish faeces (Balfry et al., 1996) that are liable to sink close to their source rather than be transmitted over long distances.",

Since this or any other untargeted policy includes farms that are not known to be infected it has to be applied to all farms, not just the small number known to be infected, therefore any practical infection removal policy must impose minimal costs. However fallowing would require that sites be emptied for harvest over a relatively short period at the end of a production cycle as opposed to a model of continuous input and output of fish . This episodic production could both flood local markets and might lead to cash flow problems for trout companies with relatively few farms, but is not a problem for salmon companies generally with many farms and a global market. The salmon industry already incorporates fallowing periods at the end of each production cycle and BKD does not generally appear to persist on salmon farms post fallowing . As it is already widely applied to salmon farms it may be difficult to improve on this to a significant extent. Fallowing of trout farms is less regular and so there may be room for improvement here and, since it is not targeted, could also improve control of other diseases .",

In the case of diseases that do spread more strongly through the environment, such as infectious salmon anaemia in Scotland (Murray et al., 2010) , stamping out may be important as a control measure as infection can continue to spread from farms under movement controls.",

Improved surveillance allows imposition of more movement controls. This may be short-term with a transient increase followed by a long-term decline in the number of DAOs (possibly eradication of infection) or it may be that the surveillance leads to a permanent increase in the number of farms under DAOs, but always with a reduction in the number of disease outbreaks. An increase in the number of farms with DAOs is likely to occur if the prevalence of undetected infection was large prior to the increased surveillance and the proportion of these infected farms that is detected and controlled is not enough to prevent high levels of transmission. Surveillance could be improved by increasing sampling effort or by the use of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as the screening method as this appears to be considerably more sensitive in detecting sub-clinical infection than the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening that was previously used . Surveillance could also be improved by increasing incentives for faster reporting (Horan et al., 2010) ; as BKD is notifiable a failure to report can result in prosecution, however positive incentives might improve reporting (Hennessy, 2007) , particularly of low level disease.",

We will briefly discuss the implications of these results for other potential BKD control strategies. Reduced transmission from farms with undetected infection might be achieved by simply reducing the total number of interfarm movements, and relatively low numbers of movements occur between marine salmon farms specifically to reduce the risk of spreading ISA (Murray et al., 2010) . However risk of transmission of disease through fish movements can also be reduced by relatively subtle changes to contact network structure (Green et al., 2009) , and such changes are likely to be less disruptive than simply reducing the total number of movements. The effect of change in the rate of onset of disease, x, is interesting, slower onset can lead to there being more disease. This might mean less virulent strains of R. salmoniarum could actually result in more diseased farms (although perhaps such less virulent strains would cause less mortality per outbreak) or that good farmers might spread infection more than farmers who stress their fish. Contact tracing is a good way of reducing BKD if prevalence of undetected infection is low, but not if it is high; this contrasts with general surveillance (q) that is effective even if this prevalence is reasonable high. This difference occurs because contact tracing roots out a smaller proportion of the undetected infected farms, while q identifies more cases, the larger the prevalence of undetected farms is.",

It is unlikely that salmon have a much higher relative prevalence of undetected infection, since the longer production time gives more time for disease to be expressed. We therefore suspect that salmon have a low prevalence of undetected infected farms and this low prevalence suggests that changes in controls may have a stronger effect on salmon than trout. This response applies to reduced infection control with a large increase in the cases of disease in salmon, but in trout the effect may be quite small. Conversely improved disease controls such as fallowing, reduced transmission or increased surveillance (leading to more farms being placed under movement restriction) could lead to eradication of infection from salmon, but could be costly and of limited effectiveness for trout. Existing practices in salmon production in Scotland include regular fallowing after each production cycle, which is rarely the case on trout farms where farms are in continuous production. As such, the different fallowing and biosecurity practices between the two industries may explain, at least in part, the existing difference in prevalence. Conversely, these practices can be seen as a result of the lack of incentive to invest in controls effective for BKD if consequence is low and probability of re-infection relatively high as appears to be the case for trout (Hennessy, 2007) .",

This suggests that (unless there is a high prevalence of undetected infection U*) small improvements in removal or prevention of spread (including small improvement in surveillance to allow targeted movement controls) could lead to a situation where infection is eradicated (R0 < 1). Indeed there was a period in 2006-7 when there was no known infection in salmon (Fig. 2) , although this does not mean there were no undetected infected salmon farms. Although most cases of R. salmoninarum infected salmon farms in Scotland appear to be associated with other cases in salmon and therefore probably are due to spread from other salmon farms it is possible that occasional inputs from wild reservoirs , or imported ova (Walker, 2010) , or trout farms (Fig. 2 ) are maintaining infection (Ruane et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2010) and preventing eradication from the salmon industry. As risk of infection becomes perceived to be low the incentive to invest in controls is reduced thereby increasing that risk of re-emergence (Hennessy, 2007) . Given its existing relatively high BKD prevalence, occasional external inputs are unlikely to have significant effects on R. salmoninarum epidemiology within the trout industry. The Scottish trout industry is closely coupled with that in England and Wales ; so policy change to trout must be applied at the GB level. Ireland is BKD free, even though wild salmon and sea trout can easily cross from GB and there is extensive contact with Scottish aquaculture (Ruane et al., 2009) ; thus it is possible to have a BKD free salmon aquaculture industry in an environment similar to Scotland's. The conditions under which reservoirs prevent eradication of pathogens from populations targeted for control are discussed by Haydon et al. (2002) . Reservoirs of coronavirus present at low levels in wildlife are believed to be the source of SARS (Guan et al., 2003) , but did not play a role in its spread once in the human population.",

The effectiveness of potential BKD controls depends on the existing prevalence of infection in farmed salmon and trout, and in particular on the number of farms with undetected infection. Policies that are likely to work are either those that lead to improved general farm biosecurity, regardless of official DAO status, or those that increase the efficacy of detection. Additionally, improved biosecurity is likely to give general benefits in the control of a range of diseases. Industry level benefits may be acquired at the cost of specific restrictions to the individual farms. Epidemiological separation of salmon and trout production is likely to be economically beneficial, since different optimal control strategies appear to apply to these industries.",

            "text": "Other diseases affecting agricultural or aquacultural systems may be difficult to detect if they occur asymptomatically and if so they may be spread with the movement of animals. Examples include bovine tuberculosis (Gilbert et al., 2005) , Jaagsiekte in sheep (Palmarini et al., 1999) , and Johne's Disease (Whittington and Sergeant, 2007) from agriculture and KHV (Taylor et al., 2010) and oyster herpesvirus (Arzul et al., 2002) from aquaculture. Even cases of clinical disease may go unnoticed if producers consider the condition is 'normal', e.g. bovine fasciolosis in Indonesia (Tisdell et al., 1999) . Similar modelling methods to those described here may be useful for investigating controls on these diseases (Taylor et al., 2011) . The modelling approach developed here allows parameters to be estimated for endemic diseases in steady-state by using the arbitrary time-step approach. If the prevalence of unknown infection is known (quite possible if farms change infection status frequently) the model parameters values can be strongly constrained. The approach here may be of particular use for modelling systems with relatively poor knowledge of their epidemiology and in which resources for surveillance for infection are particularly limited. This can be the case for many agricultural diseases in less developed countries and even for aquaculture in developed countries. In systems for which there is more epidemiological knowledge these simple models can be replaced with more sophisticated models that have greater predictive power, although even in these cases the simple modelling approach can give useful initial results. The value of robust surveillance programme to improve disease control policies, and to evaluate their effectiveness, is strongly emphasised.",
