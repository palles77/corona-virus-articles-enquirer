Infection with EBOV causes a high mortality rate and currently there is no FDA-licensed vaccine or therapeutic treatment available. Recently, heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a molecular chaperone, was shown to be an important host factor for the replication of several negative-strand viruses. We tested the effect of several different Hsp90 inhibitors including geldanamycin, radicicol, and 17-allylamino-17demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG; a geldanamycin analog) on the replication of Zaire EBOV. Our results showed that inhibition of Hsp90 significantly reduced the replication of EBOV. Classic Hsp90 inhibitors reduced viral replication with an effective concentration at 50% (EC 50 ) in the high nanomolar to low micromolar range, while drugs from a new class of Hsp90 inhibitors showed markedly more potent inhibition. These compounds blocked EBOV replication with an EC 50 in the low nanomolar range and showed significant potency in blocking replication in primary human monocytes. These results validated that Hsp90 is an important host factor for the replication of filoviruses and suggest that Hsp90 inhibitors may be therapeutically effective in treating EBOV infection.",

            "text": "EBOV is a filamentous, enveloped, nonsegmented, negative-sense RNA virus in the family Filoviridae. The genome is 18.9 kb in length and encodes seven structural proteins and one non-structural protein in the following order within the genome: 3' non-coding region (leader), nucleoprotein (NP), virion protein 35 (VP35), VP40, glycoprotein (sGP and GP), VP30, VP24, RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RDRP; L) protein, and a 5' non-coding region (trailer) (Sanchez, 2001) . The RDRP shares significant sequence homology to RDRPs from other nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses and is required for both viral transcription and replication of the viral genome (Whelan, Barr, and Wertz, 2004) . A common theme of these RDRPs is that they require cooperating viral and host proteins to accomplish replication and/or transcription. Some of the important host factors required for RDRP function have been identified for other negative-strand RNA viruses but host factors required for EBOV RDRP function have not been described to date (Das et al., 1998; Gupta, Shaji, and Banerjee, 2003; Shen and Masters, 2001; Strauss and Strauss, 1999; Whelan, Barr, and Wertz, 2004) .",

            "text": "Hsp90 has been shown to control viral polymerase function for several viruses. For influenza virus, Hsp90 binds to the PB2 subunit of the RNA polymerase and stimulates its activity (Momose et al., 2002) . In herpes viruses, blocking Hsp90 significantly inhibits viral replication presumably due to improper localization of the viral polymerase (Burch and Weller, 2005; Li et al., 2004) . In flock house virus, Hsp90 activity has proved to be important for stability and localization of the RNA polymerase (Kampmueller and Miller, 2005) . Recently, it was reported that Hsp90 inhibitors impaired the replication of several prototype negative-strand RNA viruses [ (vesicular stomatitis virus), Paramyxovirus (SV5, HPIV-2 & 3, SV41), and a bunyavirus (La Crosse)] by destabilization of the L protein of the viral RDRP (Connor et al., 2007) . It is thought that viruses have evolved to require the use of Hsp90 for proper folding of their RDRPs (Connor et al., 2007) . Therefore, inhibitors of Hsp90 activity could act as broad-range antiviral agents and we speculated that this hypothesis would hold true for filoviruses; therefore, we evaluated the effect of several Hsp90 inhibitors on EBOV replication. Some were natural product inhibitors while others were synthetic inhibitors. The entire panel of Hsp90 inhibitors represented three different chemical structure classes with varying potencies. Our results showed that Hsp90 inhibitors significantly inhibited the replication of EBOV, suggesting their use as a potential therapeutic. There were differences in the inhibition of EBOV replication by different Hsp90 inhibitors, indicating that some classes of Hsp90 inhibitor may be superior choices for antiviral agents. The results of this study will aid in the design of more effective therapeutics to treat EBOV infection.",

This is consistent with other reports of minimal toxicity of these compounds at or below this concentration (Kampmueller and Miller, 2005) However, all three compounds had significant effects on cellular homeostasis at high concentrations. At 25-and 50-\u00b5M levels of drug cell death rates of between 30 and 60% were observed, suggesting CC 50 concentrations between 50 and 100\u00b5M and SI 50 ratios of between 10 and 25 (see Table 1 ) When the effect of each Hsp90 inhibitor a minimally cytotoxic concentration was plotted as a function of time (inhibition at 1.6 \u00b5M, Fig2B), it is clear that while each compound blocked viral replication, this effect was not dramatic with any of the \"classic\" Hsp90 inhibitors. To determine if the results observed with the EBOV-GFP assays correlated with viral replication assays, we analyzed the same compounds by yield-reduction assays and determined viral titers by both real-time RT-PCR and plaque assays (Fig 3) . For all three Hsp90 inhibitors, we observed a reduction in viral replication where the greatest reduction in viral replication was at 24-and 48-h PI for each compound. For geldanamycin, we observed a 1.9 log 10 PFU/ml (0.5 log 10 PFUe/ml) and 0.9 log 10 PFU/ ml (0.2 log 10 PFUe/ml) reduction in virus at 24-and 48-h PI, respectively, at 12.5 \u00b5M ( Fig  3A-B) . For 17-AAG, we observed a 1.1 log 10 PFU/ml (0.2 log 10 PFUe/ml) reduction in virus at 24-and 48-h PI at similar concentrations of drug (Fig 3C-D) . For radicicol, we observed a 1.3 log 10 PFU/ml (1 log 10 PFUe/ml) and 1 log 10 PFU/ml (1.5 log 10 PFUe/ml) reduction in virus at 24-and 48-h PI, respectively (Fig 3E-F) . The viral yield reductions were statistically significant for geldanamycin (p=0.0205), 17AAG (p=0.0345), and radicicol (p=0.0100). These results showed good correlation between the microtiter plate assay and the yield reduction assay as analyzed b y plaque assay. Interestingly, when viral yield was tested by real-time RT-PCR, a different answer for viral yield reduction was obtained. For geldanamycin and 17-AAG, there appeared to be no change in viral output as measured by genome equivalents, regardless of the concentration of inhibitor used. Similarly, only the 12.5-\u00b5M concentration of radicicol showed a significant reduction in genome equivalents produced during infection. Thus, the real-time RT-PCR assay suggests that there is not a marked difference in viral replication after Hsp90 treatment. The plaque assays clearly showed viral titer reductions suggesting that these inhibitors may cause the budding of replication-defective viral particles. Alternatively, the medium could still contain the compound which could interfere with the results of the plaque assay.",

Similar to the experiments described above, when Vero cells were treated with increasing concentrations of either AV-1, AV-2, AV-3, or AV-81, and then infected with EBOV-EGFP, there was an inhibition of viral replication (Fig 4) . All four compounds showed a significant ability to reduce viral gene expression, as measured by GFP production with a maximum of 60% reduction in fluorescence at 16-h PI and 80% reduction at 40-and 48-h PI for all compounds. All three were more potent than radicicol, geldanamycin, and 17AAG. Of the three compounds tested. AV-3 was the most potent, with an EC 50 of 18.7 nM at 24-h PI and 27.3 and 27.7 at 40 and 48-h PI, respectively (Table 2) . AV-2 and AV-1 were similarly potent, with EC 50 within the range of 49.4 nM to 59.3 nM at 24-48-h PI, which were well below the concentrations at which cytotoxicity was seen. AV-81 was the least potent with an EC 50 ranging from 260 to 515.9 nM at 16-to 48-h PI. Similar GFP-expression assays were not possible in primary monocytes, because these cells are not uniformly adherent, but yield-reduction assays were done to analyze viral replication.",

In monocytes yield-reduction assays from cells treated with either 37 nm or 12.5 \u00b5M of drug showed significant decreases in viral replication ( Fig  6B) over all time points. At 48-h PI, AV-1, AV-2, and AV-3 all showed ~0.5 log 10 PFUe/ml reductions in EBOV production when used at 37 nM. At high drug concentrations, there was little evidence of replication in any drug-treated monocyte. Similar to the results of the microtiter plate assay, AV-81 was the least effective compound evaluated. When plaque reduction asays for monocytes were extended to 96-h PI, a more significant reduction in viral titers was seen in monocytes, showing that these compounds are highly effective at blocking viral replication over a significant period of time. No drug-related toxicities were noted in these assays at concentrations of drug up to 50\u00b5M. Above this concentration, toxicities were seen that were associated with DMSO, preventing an accurate calculation of CC 50 and SI 50 . These compounds appear to be much more specific and potent than the \"classic\" Hsp90 inhibitors.",

Recently the focus has shifted to targeting host factors that are co-opted for use in the life cycle of the virus. For example, Hsp90 chaperones, which constitute the most abundant folding enzymes in the cytosol, have been shown to play extensive roles for multiple viruses. Often, these proteins serve as host factors by binding viral proteins, preventing proper folding and promoting their degradation (Connor et al., 2007; Nakagawa et al., 2007) . In addition to stability, Hsp90 chaperones are necessary for the intracellular transport of multiple viral proteins. This behavior is exemplified by the reverse transcriptase from hepatitis B and the polymerase PB2 from influenza virus (Hu et al., 2004; Naito et al., 2007) .",

The use of Hsp90 inhibitors for antiviral development suggest that these inhibitors disrupt the function of the viral polymerase. This is in contrast to the use of Hsp90 inhibitors as an anticancer thereapeutic, which drive cancer cells into apoptosis. In the case of hepatitis C virus, combination therapy of polyethylene glycol-conjugated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-demethoxygeldanamycin showed enhanced inhibition of viral replication in the livers of infected mice, compared to PEG-IFN alone (Nakagawa et al., 2007) .",

All compounds appeared to be effective as evaluated using our microtiter plate assay screen. Radicicol and the flouoridated benzamides (AV-1-3) were most effective and showed over 85% reduction in our microtiter plate screening assay. In Vero cells, the detection of inhibitory activity in the microtiter plate assay screen correlated with a significant reduction in viral titer. Our analysis showed that commercially available Hsp90 inhibitors such as geldanamycin, 17-AAG, and radicicol were less potent inhibitors of EBOV than the benzamide analogs AV-1-3 (Table 1 and 2). This difference in potency of inhibition has been observed not only for Ebola virus but also for other negative-strand RNA viruses (J. Connor, unpublished observations) These results suggest that Hsp90 inhibitors with different structures will have varying efficacies against different viral pathogens. This could be due to inherent potencies of inhibition by the different compounds or to these compounds targeting different Hsp90 holoenzymes. Additionally, different cell lines may have different levels of Hsp90. The identity of the proteins within the complex are known to alter the ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90 (Pearl and Prodromou, 2006) , where all of the drugs that we tested bound Hsp90. Our results point to the fluoridated benzamide compounds tested here as promising compounds for the blockage of the pertinent EBOV-required Hsp90 complex. Each of the benzamide compounds has very strong antiviral activity in primary human monocytes. Monocytes are known to be an important early target for EBOV replication (Geisbert et al., 2003) , thus the significant antiviral effect of these compounds in these cells suggests that they might be particularly effective inhibitors of viral replication in vivo.",
