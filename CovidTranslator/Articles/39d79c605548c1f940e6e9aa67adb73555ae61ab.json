            "text": "Deaths Pneumonia and influenza rank among the top 10 causes of deaths worldwide. 1 Based on advances in access, pediatric care, and changing population demographics, relatively few pediatric pneumonia deaths still occur in industrialized countries, where deaths from pneumonia now are concentrated among older adults. Recent efforts led by the World Health Organization (WHO) to standardize estimates of burden of disease across program areas identify acute respiratory infections (ARIs) as a leading cause of death among children in developing countries; however, the proportion of all deaths attributable to ARIs declines as childhood mortality rates fall. 2 WHO has determined that ARI is the most common infectious cause of death in children younger than 5 years, with an estimated 1.89 million (95% confidence limit, 1.58 -2.19 million) deaths occurring in children younger than 5 years olds. 2 Although the proportion of deaths attributable to ARI among European children younger than 5 years of age was 11 percent, ARI caused 22 and 19 percent of such deaths in Africa and Asia, respectively. The vast majority of deaths attributable to ARI are caused by pneumonia, with bronchiolitis accounting for most of the remaining deaths. Although upper respiratory infections are extremely common occurrences, they typically are mild. We propose to use the term \"pneumonia\" in the broader sense to refer to severe acute infections of the lungs, including infections by viral, bacterial, and other pathogens, and involving the alveoli, bronchioles, bronchi, and occasionally pleura and other tissues. The United Nation's Millennial Development Goal (http://www.unmilleniumproject.org) is to reduce mortality rates by two-thirds by 2015 among children younger than 5 years old. However, the magnitude of illness attributable to pneumonia is such that countries seeking to achieve that goal will not be successful unless they give attention to pneumonia prevention and control.",

As mortality rates for both infants and children younger than 5 years old decline in developing countries, child survival data alone no longer are sufficiently sensitive or specific to guide policy makers in decision-making regarding health program investments. Comparing disease burden trends and evaluating the impact of programs between countries and/or regions also is difficult without considering major influences such as the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Newer surveillance tools are needed that measure pneumonia morbidity, in addition to mortality rates. Regional comparisons of morbidity rates must consider the impact of important factors driving overall child health status, such as neonatal health, prevalence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and malaria, and population coverage with vaccines, as well as case management interventions. 3",

During the second half of the 20th century, pneumonia deaths in children in the United States declined by 97 percent, from 24,637 in 1939 to 800 in 1996 (Fig 1) . 4 The first steep declines occurred from 1944 to 1950, likely influenced by the availability of penicillin (Fig 2) . Declines were reversed swiftly with the emergence of a new pathogen-the 1957 pandemic influenza virus (influenza A H2N2). Further declines from 1966 to 1982 appear to be attributable to expanded access to medical care, notably the Medicaid legislation (Title XIX, enacted in 1965), and increased availability of treatment services for lower-income populations. Expanded access to care, such as case management referral strategies, and antimicrobial agents for symptomatic children have measurable effects on mortality rates in many developing countries, 5 but the emergence of new pathogens, in particular the HIV and antimicrobial resistant-bacteria, has slowed the progress or fully reversed it in some areas.",

Combined data from lung aspirate and blood culture evaluations revealed that Streptococcus pneumoniae (37.9%), Haemophilus influenzae (33.2%), and Staphylococcus aureus (7.9%) were the bacteria most commonly isolated. 6 In young children, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading viral agent associated with pneumonia, although its frequency in a community fluctuates with epidemics. 7, 8 Whereas pneumococcus and H. influenzae predominate among infants and toddlers, atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae) 9 and viruses appear more often in older children.

Our understanding of which pathogens are major causes of pneumonia may be biased by the sensitivity and specificity of existing diagnostic tests, including those dependent on classic microbiology and newer molecular approaches.

Other studies have focused on enhancing the specificity of diagnosis, typically a goal for vaccine evaluations, so that one can measure the efficacy of a pathogenspecific intervention (eg, 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine) against only those pneumonias the vaccine was designed to prevent. Even differentiating bacterial from viral pneu-monias remains challenging, although recent studies show that serologic markers such as procalcitonin may hold some promise. 13 Confirming pathogen-specific, let alone serotype-specific, etiologies for pneumonia remains difficult unless lung aspirates are performed, and they are appropriate only when certain radiographic patterns are evident. Substantial efforts recently were devoted to standardizing the interpretation of x-rays from children suspected of having pneumonia, so that a common language for interpreting trials of different pneumococcal and Hib vaccines could be established. The WHO has posted the resulting standard tool on its web site 14 ; the tool focuses on identification of alveolar consolidation and/or effusions.

Is it the cold? Dry air? Do the pathogens migrate across the equator each year and return, or do they remain in a persistent or latent state within the mammalian hosts until some seasonal cue signals the time is right for re-emergence? The answers to such questions are an important area for future investigations and may hold practical implications for control of pneumonia in temperate as well as tropical regions in the future.",

Numerous study designs, including case-control, cohort, and longitudinal surveillance approaches, have been applied to identifying risk factors for acquiring pneumonia in the developing world. Rates of pneumonia vary with age 19, 20 ; rates are higher in those younger than 2 years of age compared with older children. Nutritional factors also influence risk of developing disease. Malnourished children are at higher risk of developing pneumonia and are more likely to die. Breastfeeding reduces the risk of the occurrence of episodes of pneumonia and death from ARIs. [21] [22] [23] Comorbidities, in particular HIV infection, are major risk factors for the acquisition of pneumonia in developing countries. 24 Recent studies in South Africa conducted in the context of a placebo-controlled vaccine trial estimated that hospitalization for pneumococcal bacteremic lower respiratory tract infection among HIV-infected infants who were 2 to 24 months old occurred at a rate of 1233/100,000 compared with a rate of 29/100,000 among uninfected children. 24 In addition to host factors, the environment influences the risk of developing pneumonia by its effect on exposure to pathogens and to irritants that might increase susceptibility. Indoor air quality, as indicated by type of cooking fuel used, ventilation, and passive cigarette smoke, appears to be related to the frequency of episodes of pneumonia in children in developing countries. Both family size and household crowding have been linked to the risk of developing pneumonia; whereas the former also may be influenced by birth spacing and nutritional factors, the latter is a consistent finding in developed and developing countries. Poverty is linked with higher rates of pneumonia, but this rate may reflect a combination of nutritional, environmental, and behavioral influences. Sanitation influences many health outcomes and might affect the risk of developing pneumonia directly or indirectly. Interventions promoting handwashing have resulted in reductions in respiratory illness in children, although studies have been too small to identify impact on lower respiratory infections, and handwashing may be more effective in reducing viruses compared with respiratory bacteria. However, preceding viral infection increases the risk of developing some types of bacterial pneumonia; this connection has been well-illustrated for relationships between influenza and other respiratory virus infection and secondary pneumonia caused by pneumococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and group A streptococcus.",

The 1997 outbreak of influenza A (H5N1) in Hong Kong established for the first time that avian influenza viruses could infect humans directly, with a predilection for children and a resulting illness that was fatal in 6 of 18 patients. 27, 28 The 2004 avian outbreak is far more widespread, with poultry disease reported across much of east and southeast Asia. Direct infection of humans was confirmed in patients hospitalized at major referral hospitals in Hanoi and Bangkok, raising concerns among many experts about the potential for pandemic spread (MMWR, accepted for publication). Given the wide geographic distribution of avian disease, the likelihood exists that human infections might also be more widespread, but surveillance for pneumonia in much of the region is passive or nonexistent, and laboratory capacity to identify routine pneumonia pathogens, especially less newly emergent ones, is quite limited.",

Clinical algorithms for management of severe ARIs in children, produced for the developing world, are undergoing re-evaluation to address the reality that in many countries with high prevalence of AIDS, most episodes of severe respiratory disease requiring hospitalization will be associated with HIV infection. In Soweto, where an estimated 5 percent of the birth cohort was infected with HIV in 1997 and 1998, approximately 46 percent of hospitalized children who required x-rays for acute respiratory tract infection were infected with HIV. 15 Empiric management may need to be altered in these circumstances, and offering counseling and testing for HIV to children with pneumonia may be a reasonable standard of care, particularly in locales where referrals for HIV support and treatment (eg, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis, antiretroviral treatment) are becoming available.",

Vaccine efficacy trials performed in the Gambia 11 and Chile 39,40 demonstrated that in addition to excellent vaccine efficacy being achieved against meningitis and other invasive disease, vaccinated children had 21 to 26 percent less severe pneumonia, defined by consolidation and/or effusions on radiographs, than did placebo recipients.

Communities were randomized to receive Hib conjugate vaccine combined with DTP or DTP alone, through the routine immunization program. Active surveillance targeted radiographically defined pneumonia as well as meningitis, defined by both clinical and microbiologic endpoints. Preliminary results of the trial suggest that a greater than expected burden of vaccinepreventable clinically defined meningitis exists in children in Lombok (rates 154/100,000 children \u03fd2 years), but limited or no benefit of introduction of a vaccine on respiratory end points. The findings are consistent with overall benefit to the population from Hib vaccine, but the lack of benefit for respiratory end points was challenging to interpret. Hib may not be an important cause of pneumonia in Indonesian children, or it may cause disease in children too young to have been vaccinated during the trial, or antibodies induced by Hib conjugate vaccine may have been sufficient to prevent the acquisition of invasive disease, including meningitis, but not sufficient to protect against the development of nonbacteremic pneumonia. Differential impact on pneumonias among children who did not present to healthcare facilities also might have influenced trial results. Data regarding colonization studies and additional analysis of the trial should be forthcoming. Additional evaluations of Hib vaccine in Asia also are likely to occur during the next few years.",

Although serotype distribution in many other parts of the world suggests that higher valency formulations will be needed, 44 9-and 11-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are in development stages. The 9-valent formulation from Wyeth has been studied in nearly 40,000 South African children and was 83 percent effective in reducing the incidence of invasive disease caused by vaccine-serotypes in non-HIV-infected children and 20 to 25 percent effective against radiographically defined pneumonia with alveolar consolidation in the same population (intent-to-treat and per protocol analyses, respectively). 45 Efficacy was 65 percent for vaccine-type invasive disease in HIV infected patients but only 13 percent (with 95% confidence interval -7 to 29%, ie, not significantly different from zero) in HIV infected. Other large clinical trials are ongoing with 9-valent vaccine in the Gambia and an 11-valent formulation in the Philippines; both of these studies include pneumonia and invasive disease end points. Although efficacy against invasive disease caused by vaccine serotypes consistently has been demonstrated for conjugate pneumococcal vaccines, the ultimate effectiveness of this kind of vaccine for noninvasive syndromes, including pneumonia, has been challenging to measure. The standardization of pneumonia endpoints determined by radiology has been a focus of WHO, 14 and standard tools for measuring colonization across clinical trials also have been developed. 46 A new challenge will be to bridge from the results of efficacy trials of radiographic pneumonia to end points that can be tracked more easily in diverse developing countries. Thus, trial investigators and other surveillance efforts also are tracking potentially preventable respiratory disease burden measured through more accessible indicators, such as hospital admissions for pneumonia. To accelerate development of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, the Gates Foundation is supporting the PNEUMO-ADIP (Accelerated development and introduction plan) (www. preventpneumonia.com), which has in turn funded regional surveillance networks and enhanced research activities performed at vaccine field trial sites and elsewhere.

Whether replacement with nonvaccine serotypes eventually will blunt the impact of conjugate vaccines on pneumococcal invasive disease and pneumonia is not known yet.",

Common protein vaccines also are promising as potential tools for prevention of noninvasive pneumonia in adults, which is a major cause of illness and death in developed countries.",

In 2002, the American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices formally encouraged the immunization of children 6 through 23 months of age, with the ultimate goal being universal immunization among young children. 50,51 The burden of influenza in tropical and developing regions is not well appreciated, but recent evidence implies that, contrary to predictions based on the attenuation of influenza by hot weather, the burden among children in tropical and subtropical regions may be as great or greater than that in temperate zones. 52 Better information about the occurrence of influenza in the tropics, seasonal patterns, and the burden of disease in young children in rural areas will be important for guiding future efforts to control pneumonia associated with influenza infection in developing countries.",

One example of an approach to such surveillance systems was implemented in 2002 by the Thai Ministry of Public Health, with support from the International Emerging Infections Program (IEIP) of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The IEIP surveillance is a population-based system conducted throughout two provinces that focuses on complete ascertainment of severe pneumonia, digitalization of radiographic images, and comprehensive testing for a battery of pneumonia pathogens. 53 Although the system focuses on the causes and burden of severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization, periodic community surveys measure the burden of less severe pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses. A focus on laboratory testing is aimed at permitting estimation of disease caused by potentially available vaccines, such as influenza vaccines and the conjugate Hib and pneumococcal vaccines. A second IEIP in Kenya will expand and adapt the surveillance to the African setting in 2004 and may help to provide rigorous data on the burden of disease caused by specific pneumonia pathogens to help guide control measures. Strengthened surveillance of pneumonia in other countries will be needed in the future as new vaccines and other tools to control pneumonia become more widely available.",

Expanded access to Hib conjugate vaccine and continued development of pneumococcal and RSV vaccines are needed to have substantial impact on continued disease burden. New pathogens pose ongoing threat to control of pneumonia, either by causing pneumonia (eg, human metapneumovirus, SARS coronavirus, or avian influenza) directly or by drastically modifying host susceptibility to pneumonia agents (as is the case with HIV). The pneumonia research field has suffered from fragmentation between those evaluating improvements in treatment (eg, integrated management of childhood illness, vitamin A and zinc supplementation, short course antibiotics) and those investigating prevention (pneumococcal, Hib, RSV vaccines). Both groups will benefit from having common tools for diagnosis and surveillance of pneumonia and from collaborating on achieving real progress in prevention and control of pneumonia.",
