Alternative methods which have been employed include immunoelectron-microscopy (IEM), immunoelectro-osmophoresis (IEOP), complement fixation (CF), radioimmunoassay (RIA), enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence (IF) (Flewett and Woode, 1978) . Woode et al. (1976) demonstrated cross reactions among RV of different species by immunodiffusion (ID) using a group antigen associated with the inner of the two capsid layers. However, they found ID to be of low relative sensitivity compared to EM. Mathan et al. (1977) successfully used ID to test faeces or sera for RV antigen or antibody respectively, but did not indicate the sensitivity of the test. Mohammed et al. (1978) compared the ability of counter-immunoelectrophoresis (CIEP), CF, haemagglutination and ID to detect various RV antigens. They found all tests, except CF, to be more sensitive in detecting soluble antigen than other antigens, and CIEP to be the procedure of choice for routine testing. Rhodes et al. (1979) compared ID, IF and EM for antigen detection and found more positives were detected by ID and EM.",

Of the three precipitating antigens, two could be directly correlated with RV virion, one with a double capsid from a 1.36 g/ml density fraction and the other with a single capsid from a 1.38 g/ml density fraction. Due to the poor diffusion rate of particulate antigens, each of these reactions occurred close to the antigen well and thus was not suitable as reference antigen for diagnostic work. The third antigen, from a 1.23--1.28 g/ml fraction, did not contain virions demonstrable by EM. It diffused more rapidly than the other two antigens and precipitation occurred near the middle of the reaction zone. It had the practical advantage of being demonstrable in higher dilutions of viral or infected faecal extracts than were the two virion antigens. It provided a suitable reference line against which to test samples of unknown reactivity, and was selected as the reference antigen.",

In other CsC1 gradients it was found predominantly in a 1.23--1.28 g/ml fraction, but was also present in small amounts in all fractions. The relationship between \"soluble\" and virion is not clear. Specificity of the test was shown to be broad, encompassing RV infections of a wide variety of hosts and a number of RV virus types or subtypes distinguishable by virus neutralization (Dr S. Tzipori, personal communication). As it seems that RV types may vary within a single host species (Thouless et al., 1978; Zissis and Lambert, 1978) , the broad specificity of the test is an advantage in many circumstances where discrimination within the RV group is not required. The epidemiologieal specificity (Martin, 1977) of immunodiffusion is high. In the present work it is not demonstably less than 1.00.",

Some points of procedure should be noted as important for the better results obtained from ID in the present work. It is probably most important that the sample be tested in the presence of known positive antigen and antibody, between which a reference line of precipitation is formed. The dilutions of reference reactants should be carefully chosen to produce a line of maximum sharpness and extent just sufficient to reach the well containing the test sample. The use of a reference line in ID is essential to establish the specificity of a reaction, and according to its strength determines the sensitivty of the test.",

The description of whole (double capsid) virion agglutination by type and specific neutralizing sera, and the deduction that type-specific antigenic activity is located in the outer capsid (Bridger, 1978) , suggest that the precipitin reaction involving double capsid virions may also be type specific. The use of this reaction for diagnostic purposes is limited, at least in the patterns used routinely, by the poor diffusion of the antigen. It could possibly be used in patterns designed to straighten the reference line, or by absorption methods prior to ID.",
