We evaluated 87 consecutive ankles in 87 patients (49 males [56.32%] and 38 females [43.68%]). Of the 87 patients, 15 (17.24%) withdrew or were lost to follow-up, leaving 72 patients (82.76%) in the present study. Their mean age was 35.2 (range 17 to 67) years. Nineteen patients (26.39%) presented with a pure syndesmotic disruption, and 53 (73.61%) had associated malleolar fractures. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society scale score improved significantly from 31.2 AE 4.2 preoperatively to 88.5 AE 5.3 at an average of 24 months postoperatively (p < .0043). Revision was undertaken because of implant failure in 4 ankles (5.56%). Two revisions (2.78%) were performed in 2 ankles because of early weightbearing in the first 2 weeks after surgery. The third patient (1.39%) underwent revision at 5 weeks postoperatively. This syndesmotic reduction failure was attributed to failure of the threads, which was noted at the second surgery. The fourth patient (1.39%), a 66-year-old male, underwent revision at 5 months postoperatively because of persistent infection. An 18-month postoperative radiograph was available for all patients. The medial clear space had significantly decreased, from 8.2 AE 3.1 mm preoperatively to 3.5 AE 2.2 mm at 18 months postoperatively (p < .0344). Likewise, the tibiofibular clear space had decreased significantly, from a mean of 8.8 AE 3.7 mm preoperatively to a mean of 3.7 AE 2.2 mm at 18 months postoperatively (p < .0322). In conclusion, suturebutton fixation described in the present report delivered satisfactory functional outcomes and anatomic reduction at minimum of 18 months after surgery.",

The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society scale score had improved significantly from 31.2 AE 4.2 preoperatively to 88.5 AE 5.3 at an average of 24 months postoperatively (p < .0043). A total of 4 superficial wound infections (5.56%) were documented postoperatively and were treated successfully with antibiotics.

Two revisions (2.78%) were required in 2 ankles because of early weightbearing in the first 2 weeks after surgery. The early weightbearing resulted in subsidence and pull through of the small plate into the bone and was attributed to the osteoporotic nature of the patient. Additionally, this was 1 of the earliest cases we performed, and the failure could have been attributed to probable inadequacy in the technique. Both revisions were performed using the same construct to achieve anatomic reduction, and both healed completely, with no other surgery required. The third patient (1.39%) underwent revision at 5 weeks postoperatively. This syndesmotic reduction failure was attributed to failure of the threads noted at the second surgery. The revision included repair of the soft tissue envelope (including the deltoid ligament), hardware removal, and fixation with a syndesmotic screw. The fourth patient (1.39%), a 66-year-old male, underwent revision at 5 months because of persistent infection. Pain was persistent over the anterior ankle. At exploration, the construct was found to be loose, with evidence of infection, which was proved by culture and sensitivity. The symptoms resolved after removal of the construct, and further revision was not required.",

At present, our aging populations have led to increased pressures on healthcare funding. Subsequently, cost effectiveness is a crucial element in medical practice, especially in both developing and developed countries. Our proposed fixation technique offers a substitute solution with what we believe are similar biomechanical and physiologic features but less expensive in terms of the crude costs (7, (9) (10) (11) (12) . A key advantage of the technique we have described in the present study is the lower cost of the fixation construct, which might influence cost-effectiveness. The crude cost of this concept is approximately $45 (USD) compared with approximately $625 (USD), which is the cost of the commercially available alternative provided by Arthrex \u00d2 (Arthrex Inc., Naples, FL) at our institution.",
