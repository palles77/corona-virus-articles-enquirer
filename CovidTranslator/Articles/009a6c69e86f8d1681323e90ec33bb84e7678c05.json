Epidemics in wildlife are problematic because they can lead to pathogen spillover to new host organisms, erode biodiversity and threaten ecosystems that sustain human societies (Fisher et al. 2012; Kilpatrick 2011) . There have been recent calls for large-scale research approaches to combat the threats EIDs pose to wildlife (Sleeman 2013) . While it is true that developing new analytical models, diagnostic assays and molecular tools will significantly advance our abilities to respond to disease threats, we also propose that addressing difficult problems in EIDs will require considerable shifts in international health policy and infrastructure. While there are currently international organizations responsible for rapidly initiating and coordinating preventative measures to control infectious diseases in human, livestock, and arable systems, there are few comparable institutions that have the authority to implement transnational responses to EIDs in wildlife. This absence of well-developed infrastructure hampers the rapid responses necessary to mitigate international spread of EIDs.",

Therefore, the root of the problem can remain largely neglected, and pathogen spread often becomes too extensive for control efforts to be effective. Furthermore, the loss of biodiversity due to EIDs creates a suite of new challenges that we are just beginning to recognize as we gain an understanding of the ecosystem services that wild populations provide (Fisher et al. 2012) .",

In particular, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) assumed an important role in facilitating communication among researchers and wildlife managers. USFWS involvement was partly due to the fact that some WNS-affected bat species were already listed as ''Endangered'' under the US Endangered Species Act. In contrast, a coordinated response in Canada, where there is no federal protection of affected species, was slower despite similar levels of disease-related mortality. Currently, trends predict decline and possible extinction of multiple bat species, which creates complex and costly problems, including listing multiple bat species on endangered species lists (Frick et al. 2010) .",

However, by emulating other emergency response models, we can lay the groundwork for high priority actions.
