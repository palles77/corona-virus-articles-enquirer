As human beings derive ever more food from the sea yet persist in destroying the nurseries that supply that harvest, local and global fisheries have begun to collapse. 5 Since twothirds of the world's population depends on fish as their main source of protein, 6 continued destruction of marine ecosystems will probably have a severe effect on human health worldwide.",

In particular, the zoonotic transfer of a disease from another avian or mammalian species to human beings has become increasingly common, accounting for 75% of the emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases recorded in the past decade. 7 Prominent examples of zoonotic diseases are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Lyme disease, which have affected thousands of people and resulted in economic losses of tens of billions of US dollars. 8, 9 Other pathogens, such as West Nile, Ebola, and Nipah viruses, may have a growing, harmful effect on human health. Notwithstanding their impact and the attention they garner, the ecology of many zoonotic diseases remains understudied and poorly understood. For example, whereas civet cats found in markets in China have been identified as harbouring SARS, the species that serves as the reservoir for the SARS virus has not yet been determined. However, scientists have linked the reduction of mammalian biodiversity with increased likelihood of human cases of Lyme disease, 10 but responses to the disease are still focused on individual treatment rather than better land use and wildlifemanagement policies that might stem the spread of Lyme and possibly other new pathogens.",

            "text": "Land-use change, along with global warming, has further led to rises in insect-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue, and filariasis in many parts of the world. [11] [12] [13] When trees are cut down and rutted logging roads are left behind, puddles and sunshine create new habitats for malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Indeed, the increase in malarial mosquitoes in Peru is closely correlated with forest clearance. 14 The rise in global temperatures has in many places affected the life histories of mosquitoes and other disease vectors, resulting in more outbreaks occurring in more places at more times during the year. 15, 16 Apart from deforestation and rising temperatures, other human actions affecting disease emergence include poorly managed urbanisation, conflict-related events, inappropriate use of antimicrobials and insecticides, and many water-related issues, including dam construction, irrigation, and waste-water mismanagement. 17 If these difficulties were not enough, lack of infrastructure to control chemical and organic pollutants of air and water have rendered indoor and outdoor environments extremely dangerous to long-term human health. Polluted sources of drinking and bathing water cause widespread and severe health problems, and are especially lethal to children. Acute respiratory infections linked to indoor air pollution kill 1\u00b76 million people per year, mostly children and women. 18 This figure represents an enormous loss of human and economic potential in developing countries. Furthermore, urban air pollution causes the premature death of an additional estimated 0\u00b75-1\u00b70 million people in developing countries per year. 19 How then can the degradation of the environment be contained and environmental sustainability be achieved? A first challenge to overcome is the fact that, although scientifically sound, the concept of environmental sustainability does not translate immediately into operational objectives. To this end, the task force recommends that as part of their national-level processes for the Millennium Development Goals, countries should set their own long-term objectives, such as maintaining a specific share of natural forests, lowering acid deposition below a certain threshold, or achieving a target level of nutrient load in critical freshwater ecosystems.",

These tested interventions can be delivered at scale provided that countries have access to substantially strengthened human resources and increased financial resources. Least-developed countries and many other poor countries will be likely to require additional external finance to improve environmental management However, technical interventions, no matter how good, will not be sufficient unless they are accompanied by structural changes to effectively integrate the environment into all development plans and sector policies. First, among these changes is the need to strengthen public institutions responsible for environmental policymaking and to build up environmental expertise in other government groups, such as ministries for health or infrastructure, to better appraise environmental consequences of all sector strategies. Second, countries need to correct market failures and remove distortions that exacerbate environmental degradation. Thus, wherever possible, countries should phase out damaging subsidies that overcapitalise industries such as farming, fishing, and forestry, and that promote inefficiencies, overextraction, and environmental damage. Third, we underscore the importance of improving our knowledge",

Moreover, environmental education and training must be integrated into the curricula of primary and secondary schools worldwide to improve the public's understanding of the environment. 20 Finally, efficiency gains through advanced science and technologies directed at environmental challenges can slow the rise in demand for certain ecosystem services. Several proven approaches exist to promote science and technology that can be harnessed for the environment. The knowledge and tools exist to guide us toward an environmentally sustainable future. However, the lack of success in stemming environmental degradation over the past decades has shown that the challenge lies in applying them. Successful implementation is key and will hinge on the active participation of the private and public sectors, as well as an informed and engaged citizenry. The Millennium Development Goals provide an important operational framework for addressing environmental sustainability in concert with other development priorities. During 2005, the international community should honour its commitment to support all countries in scaling-up direct investments in environmental management and implementing the structural changes that underpin them.
