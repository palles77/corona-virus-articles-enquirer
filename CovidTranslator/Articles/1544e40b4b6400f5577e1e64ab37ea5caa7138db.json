Y. pestis causes a severe pneumonia in both humans and animals when given by the inhalation route. Comparison of serum cytokine responses among patients with CAP, SARS pneumonia, and plague pneumonia revealed significant differences in serum cytokine profiles. It seemed that IL-6 was the only elevated cytokine in patients with pneumonia caused by Y. pestis or S. pneumoniae. Unfortunately, only two cytokines, IL-1\u2424 and IL-6, were detected in patients with CAP caused by S. pneumoniae (13) , and we could compare only IL-6 changes in patients with pneumonia caused by Y. pestis or S. pneumoniae. Interestingly, serum concentrations of IL-6 were significantly elevated in all patients infected with M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, or influenza A virus (11), S. pneumoniae (13) , SARS virus (9, 20, 25), or Y. pestis. Our results further provided evidence for the notion that elevated IL-6 concentrations correlate with the degree of severity of inflammation rather than the specific etiologic agent of pneumonia (16) .

Therefore, elevated serum IL-6 production levels might originate from injured pulmonary bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells (25) . Likewise, elevated IL-6 levels might be released from endothelial cells within the injured lung tissue of pneumonic plague patients. It has been found that IL-10 and TNF-\u2423 levels were elevated in SARS patients (9, 20, 25) , and elevated TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 levels were observed in patients with pneumonia caused by M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, or influenza A virus (11) . In the animal experiment, pCD1 \u03e9 but not pCD1 \u03ea of Y. pestis could strongly suppress endogenous TNF-\u2423 production in mice (17) . There was no elevated IFN-\u2425 production in plague patients, but IFN-\u2425 production was significantly increased in mice (2) and rats (1) 72 h after infection with aerosolized Y. pestis, indicating that there might be different cytokine profiles in humans and rodents. However, in an intranasally infected mouse model of pneumonic plague, genes encoding a variety of cytokines are upregulated in the early phase (at 12 h postinfection) of infection, but they are downregulated in the middle phase (at 24 h postinfection), indicating inhibition of the host defense system during the development of plague (14) . Unfortunately, due to the sudden outbreak, serum samples from these patients were not collected in the earlier stages. Therefore, the cytokine concentrations in Qinghai plague patients and infected animals with aerosolized Y. pestis in the early acute phase of PPP were not available for comparison. Since no associations between cytokine concentrations and patients' sex or history of antibiotics have been documented for CAP patients (16), we could not determine whether the measured levels of some cytokines had waned due to treatment with antibiotics or differences in patients' age or sex in this preliminary investigation. IL-10 production was undetectable in plague patients, which is consistent with the results for sera of mice infected with Y. pestis by the intranasal route (12, 14) . ",
