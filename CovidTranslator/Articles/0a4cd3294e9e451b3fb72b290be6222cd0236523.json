The cadence of emerging infectious diseases that travel, transmit and stand ready to spark a public health emergency of international concern seems to be accelerating. These infectious diseases cause significant human suffering, can overwhelm unprepared health care systems, and significantly disrupt societies and economies. It is estimated that a severe pandemic similar to the 1918 ''Spanish flu\" could nowadays cost as much as 5% of global gross domestic product; the global cost of even a moderately severe pandemic could be as much as US$ 570 billion, or 0.7% of global income [1] .",

Not so exotic and all too familiar -casually referred to as the ''flu\" -influenza is the virologist's Trojan horse, as it readily and rapidly mutates (drift), has the ability to swap genetic elements from influenza viruses with origins in other species (shift) and, as an RNA virus lacks repair and self-correcting mechanisms that are the basis of its genetic instability and makes it both dangerous and unpredictable.
