One has to wonder if the utter dismissal of immunizations would occur if it were recognized measles, for example is a preventable cause of blindness in the developing world. With the vaccine more readily available in Africa, such events have been reduced. Would the testimony of a parent whose child is blind from measles, or died from a vaccine preventable disease make an impact? Would the stridence against such powerful medical interventions persist?

Not unexpectedly, there are changes in the type of TAI reflective of the changing destinationsfrom tourism to work and destination based travel, and the local, endemic illnesses found therein [5] . The most common sites for contracting malarial illness, the most common TAI in one study, were sub-Saharan Africa (77%), and Oceania (6%) [1, 2] . Giardiasis and Dengue fever were the second and third most commonly diagnosed TAI respectively. Of note, gastrointestinal illness represented $25% and febrile or viral syndrome caused about 10% with respiratory syndromes affecting about 5% of TAI patients. These data are not unexpected given travelers often spend upwards of 7 -17 hours in close proximity during airline travel. Even with improved ventilation and air turnover in modern jet travel, the small distance between and prolonged exposure to people make travelers vulnerable to respiratory and other infections. Financial considerations impact airlines; it is obvious to any frequent flier there remains a lack of proper between-flight cleaning of surfaces (seatback trays, lavatories, arm rests) which increases the likelihood of disease transmission. Frequent hand washing, avoiding touching nose, mouth and eyelids are important basic approaches travelers can take to reduce risk, as well as proper vaccination.",

In the aftermath of avian and swine influenza outbreaks, an ebola event that was unlike others in the past, and evolving, highly pathogenic coronaviruses, such advice must now be called into question. Consider global travel and immigration into the United States from countries with endemic illnesses not commonly found in North America. Also societal factors (domestic and international) that include poverty, homelessness, institutionalization, overcrowdingin health care facilities as well as domiciles and lack of access to timely healthcare, these all set the stage to create conditions that facilitate the spread of diseases that are from previously unknown, little recognized, or emerging pathogens. Endemic, even novel strains in foreign lands, can become very quickly clinical realities and community-wide problems in the U.S. That is to say, we now need to think zebras as well as horses.

While some health care facilities (HCF) have improved access to masks and hand sanitizers, as well as placed cough/sneeze etiquette posters, these can have limited value if manpower shortages, cultural imperatives, for example going to a health care facility with many members of the family, language and education barriers all work against social distancing, personal hygiene and other containment strategies. Some practices and health care facilities have implemented old pediatric strategies of placing potentially contagious patients into separate areas. Clearly this is a space, manpower and resource intensive strategy, but one that may reduce transmission of illness from those who are injured. On the regional and national level, a serious discussion on best practices in terms of how to cohort and isolate potentially contagious people, as well as strategies to alleviate overcrowding, much of which stems from the misuse of ED and HCF for primary care problems is vitally necessary.",
