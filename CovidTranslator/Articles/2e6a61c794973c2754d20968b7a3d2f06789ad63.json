Ampligen \u00ae demonstrated very high potency at very low concentrations (0.4 \u03bcg/ mL) and had a favourable safety profile. [4] In October 2003, Hemispherx announced that, based on these promsing new results, the company will stockpile injectible and/or oral formats of Ampligen \u00ae and Alferon N \u00ae . [5] Independent researchers have demonstrated the antiviral activity of Ampligen \u00ae against flaviviruses (West Nile virus, Equine Encephalitis virus, Dengue fever virus and Japanese Encephalitis virus) as well as virus classes associated with bioterrorism. In an animal study, Ampligen \u00ae was shown to prevent destruction of nerve cells, reduce virus concentrations in the brain and blood stream and increase survival rates. [6] Researchers at the Rega Institute in Belgium have published results from an animal study demonstrating that Ampligen \u00ae was superior at protecting mice against coxsackie B3 virus-induced myocarditis compared with pegylated interferon.
