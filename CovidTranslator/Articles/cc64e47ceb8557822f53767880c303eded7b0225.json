Epidemiological surveys have shown that an increased risk of developing MS was associated with late infection with mumps, measles and Epstein-Barr virus. Additionally, exacerbations of MS are frequently preceded by viral infections. Interestingly, several viral agents including measles, mumps, parainfluenza type I, coronavirus, Epstein-Barr and human herpes type 6 have been detected in the brains of MS patients. Thus, it is intriguing that the antiviral, IFN-\u2424 , has been reported to have a beneficial effect on relapsing/remitting MS. One mechanism of stress-induced exacerbation might be via increased glucocorticoid secretion resulting in immunosuppression and reactivation of latent viruses, such as herpes virus.",

            "text": "The effects of stress on the immune response to Theiler's virus. Restraint stress induces increased production of glucocorticoids which cause global immunosuppression in Theiler's virusinfected mice. Stress-induced effects are contained within boxes: decreases are denoted by a downward arrow and increases by an upward arrow. Theiler's virus is taken up either by antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages or dendritic cells or infects other cell types. Antigen processing occurs and viral peptides are presented to T cells via their T cell receptor (TCR) in the context of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC I/II). Natural killer cell activity is reduced by stress and also the production of IFN-\u2425 is reduced, which in turn reduces the activation of macrophages and T cells through signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)1 signaling. Th1 cells are driven by the transcrip-tion factor T-bet and activated by IL-12 through STAT4-signaling pathways. Th2 T cell responses are driven by GATA-3 and activation by IL-4 secretion and STAT6 signaling. Stress reduces the amount of IL-12 secreted by the antigen-presenting cells and then reduces the activation state of the Th1 cells. Stress also reduces mRNA expression of both T-bet and GATA-3 and thereby reduces both Th1 and Th2 responses. Stress also decreases the production of Ltn, IP-10, RANTES, MIP-1 and MCP-1 which reduces the inflammatory cell infiltrate into the CNS. Stress also reduces the expression of LT-\u2424 which has anti-viral properties along with IFN-\u2425 and this may also contribute to the increased viral titers seen in the CNS. Interestingly, stress increases IL-6, G-CSF and KC. The increased KC production may account for the increased numbers of circulating neutrophils.",
