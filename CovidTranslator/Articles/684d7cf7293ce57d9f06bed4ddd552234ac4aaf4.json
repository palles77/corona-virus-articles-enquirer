Endemic viruses are constantly highly prevalent in a population but exhibit low pathogenicity (1), thereby often causing permanent infection (12) . Epidemic viruses, in contrast, infect a population briefly but cause higher host mortality (2) and leave a small proportion of infected hosts as asymptomatic carriers. While endemic diseases can persevere even in lowdensity populations, epidemic diseases need certain threshold densities of susceptibilities for their establishment in natural populations. Thus, epidemic outbreaks depend on large numbers of susceptibilities (12) , and their extent depends on the size of the susceptible host population (4, 8) . In the Serengeti, infections of canine distemper virus (CDV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), and feline parvovirus (FPV) have occurred in times of high-population density, while feline calicivirus infections (FCV) seemed to be density independent (12) . Thus, lowdensity populations should be less affected by epidemic diseases, while endemic viruses should exhibit a similarly high prevalence in low-and high-density populations due to their density independence.",

Similar to outbreaks of FCoV and FPV, CDV outbreaks seem to require Table 1. large numbers of susceptibilities and occur during times of high-population densities, while FCV outbreaks seemed to be density independent (2, 12) . Generally, lion densities in East Africa are much higher than in Southern Africa (5, 6; S. Ramsauer and B.
