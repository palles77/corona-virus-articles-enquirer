In addition, recent studies indicate that CXCL10 exerts a diverse array of biological activities, including inducing antimicrobial effects (Cole et al, 2001) , inhibiting angiogenesis (Angiolillo et al, 1995; Strieter et al, 1995) , and contributing to T-cell effector responses (Dufour et al, 2002) . Both type I and II interferons have been shown to induce CXCL10 gene expression in numerous cell types (Vanguri and Farber, 1990; Luster and Ravetch, 1987; Gattass et al, 1994) . Expression of CXCL10 has been demonstrated in many inflammatory disease conditions, such as psoriasis (Gottlieb et al, 1988; Flier et al, 2001) , rheumatoid arthritis (Patel et al, 2001) , glomerular nephritis (Romagnani et al, 1999) , diabetes (Shimada et al, 2001) , and tissue-graft rejection (Hancock et al, 2000 (Hancock et al, , 2001 , and is thought to contribute to disease progression by attracting leukocytes into affected tissues in which CXCL10 is expressed.",

            "text": "CXCL10 is also considered to contribute to various neuroinflammatory pathologies, including stroke (Wang et al, 2000) , Alzheimer's disease (Xia et al, 2000) , viral encephalitis Lahrtz et al, 1997) , as well as the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) (Sorensen et al, 1999; Simpson et al, 2000; Balashov et al, 1999) . Astrocytes have been demonstrated to be the primary cellular source of CXCL10 surrounding active demyelinating lesions present in MS patients (Sorensen et al, 1999; Simpson et al, 2000; Balashov et al, 1999) . Patients diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS exhibited increased MJ Trifilo and TE Lane levels of CXCL10 within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during periods of clinical disease that correlated with increased numbers of CXCR3-expressing T cells (Sorensen et al, 1999) . When clinical symptoms subsided, CSF levels of CXCL10 were reduced and T-cell infiltration was limited. These studies suggest that CXCL10 contributes to the pathology of demyelination by attracting T cells into the central nervous system (CNS), which then participate in white matter destruction. In support of this theory are recent studies from animal models of demyelination that have increased our understanding of the functional significance of CXCL10 expression within the CNS. Administration of neutralizing antibodies specific for CXCL10 to mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) resulted in a marked improvement in neurologic disease, accompanied by an inhibition in the progression of demyelination and increased remyelination that correlated with reduced T-cell infiltration into the CNS (Liu et al, 2001b) . Moreover, MHV infection of CXCL10 \u2264/\u2264 mice results in reduced T-cell infiltration into the CNS and only mild demyelination (Dufour et al, 2002) . CXCL10 also contributes to neuroinflammation and disease in mice with the autoimmune demyelinating disease, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) (Fife et al, 2001) . Collectively, these studies indicate that CXCL10 expression contributes to demyelination by attracting T cells into the brain and spinal cord.",

Although numerous chemokines are expressed during neuroinflammatory disease conditions, there is increasing evidence that CXCL10 may be a key signaling molecule with regards to induction and maintenance of T-cell infiltration and neurologic damage. However, the majority of these studies were performed using either a neurotropic virus capable of replicating within the CNS or in an autoimmune model of demyelination in which a defined encephalitogen, e.g., myelin basic protein (MBP), is employed (Liu et al, 2001b; Fife et al, 2001) . Therefore, the capacity in which CXCL10 contributes to neuropathology in the absence of these signals is not well defined.",

In vitro infection of an astrocyte cell line with AdCXCL10 resulted in increased expression of CXCL10 protein within 24 hours post infection (p.i.) as compared to cells infected with the adenovirus vector containing \u03bc-galactosidase (Ad\u03bcgal) as detected by Western blot analysis ( Figure 1A ). These results indicated that CXCL10 expression was derived primarily by adenovirus vector containing the murine CXCL10 gene and was not in response to adenovirus infection of cells. In order to determine if the adenovirus-derived CXCL10 was able to attract activated lymphocytes, a chemotaxis assay was performed using lymphocytes obtained from the spleens of mice immunized with MHV. Previous studies have indicated that MHV infection results in increased expression of the CXCL10 receptor CXCR3 on T cells, therefore these cells will respond to CXCL10 signaling . Exposure of activated lymphocytes to supernatant from AdCXCL10-infected cells resulted in a significant increase (P \u2264 .05) in cell migration as compared to cells exposed to supernatant from Ad\u03bcgal-infected cells ( Figure 1B ). Addition of anti-CXCL10 antibody to the AdCXCL10 supernatant resulted in a significant reduction (P \u2264 .05) in chemotaxis, indicating that CXCL10 was responsible for the increased leukocyte migration associated with AdCXCL10 supernatant.",

Comparable levels of CCL5 transcripts were found in the brains of both AdCXCL10-and Ad\u03bcgal-infected mice ( Figure 2D ).

In contrast, there was sustained CD8 + T-cell infiltration into the CNS of AdCXCL10-infected mice at day 14 p.i., and this dropped only slightly by day 21 p.i., suggesting that CD8 + T cells were more responsive to CXCL10induced chemotaxis as compared to CD4 + T cells at later times p.i.

Such analysis revealed that although there was increased cellular infiltration into the CNS of AdCXCL10-infected mice as early as day 3 p.i., neuropathology was detectable only at later time points. Compared to Ad\u03bcgal-infected mice, AdCXCL10-infected animals displayed increased cellular accumulation within the brain characterized by perivascular and meningeal inflammatory lesions at day 21 p.i. (Figure 3A ). These cells appear to be lymphocytes based on morphol-ogy (inset to Figure 3A ), which is consistent with the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) data presented in Table 1 . Increased numbers of cells were detectable within the olfactory bulb as well as the thalamus, indicating that cells were able to invade the brain parenchyma ( Figure 3C and E, respectively). Cellular infiltrates were located primarily within the internal granular layer of the olfactory bulb, although cells could be detected in the external plexiform layer separating the mitral and glomerular layer neurons ( Figure 3C ). At this time, the cell type is unknown; however, the cellular morphology is suggestive of either plasma cells or neutrophils (inset to Figure 3C ). Infiltration into the thalamus was accompanied by mild grey and white matter destruction ( Figure 3E ). In marked contrast, histologic analysis of the brains of Ad\u03bcgal-infected mice at day 21 p.i. indicated there were no detectable inflammatory cells lining endothelial vessel walls ( Figure 3B ) nor present in olfactory bulb or thalamus ( Figure 3D and F). These data are not surprising based on flow analysis of brains from these mice indicating that T-cell infiltration is not detectable at this time point.",

For example, Liu et al (2001b) have demonstrated that chronic expression of CXCL10 by astrocytes within the CNS of mice persistently infected with MHV results in T-cell accumulation accompanied by robust demyelination, suggesting a role for CXCL10 in disease pathogenesis. Indeed, antibody-mediated neutralization of CXCL10 resulted in a pronounced reduction in neurologic disease severity and demyelination, accompanied by reduced T-cell accumulation within the CNS. Similar results were observed following MHV infection of CXCL10 \u2264/\u2264 mice (Dufour et al, 2002) . Furthermore, evidence from human neurologic diseases including MS, Alzheimer's disease, and viral meningitis have all implicated a role for CXCL10 in attracting T cells into the CNS (Xia et al, 2000; Liu et al, 2000; Lahrtz et al, 1997; Sorensen et al, 1999; Simpson et al, 2000; Balashov et al, 1999) . Therefore, the cumulative evidence points to a significant role for CXCL10 in regulating leukocyte trafficking into the CNS and disease progression in a variety of neuroinflammatory diseases. The present study was undertaken to better understand the contributions of CXCL10 in the development of neuropathology. To this end, we have constructed a replication-deficient adenovirus vector that constitutively expresses murine CXCL10. Instillation of AdCXCL10 into the CNS of C57BL/6 mice MJ Trifilo and TE Lane resulted in expression of CXCL10 mRNA transcripts up to 21 days p.i. In addition, elevated levels of transcripts for the chemokines CXCL9, CCL2, and CCL5 were detected in the brains of AdCXCL10-infected mice at all time points analyzed. Mice infected with Ad\u03bcgal exhibited a slight increase in transcript levels for CXCL10; however, CXCL9 transcripts were not detected at any time point. Although previous reports have indicated an important role for IFN-\u03bc in triggering CXCL9 expression in cells, examination of IFN-\u03bc within the brains of both AdCXCL10-and Ad\u03bcgal-infected mice revealed very low level expression of IFN-\u03bc mRNA and no detectable differences between infected groups at any time point examined.",

In support of this are recent studies indicating that both IFN-\u03bc as well as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03bc can induce CXCL9 expression in the absence of IFN-\u03bc costimulation (Stylianou et al, 2002; Janatpour et al, 2001) . AdCXCL10-infected mice consistently expressed increased transcript levels for CCL2 at all time points examined compared to Ad\u03bcgal-infected mice. Although Ad\u03bcgal-infected mice also expressed CCL2 and CCL5, transcript levels for these chemokines were consistently reduced at the majority of time points analyzed. These results were not completely surprising as these chemokines have been shown to be expressed following adenovirus infection of the CNS of C57BL/6 mice (Charles et al, 1999) . Collectively, these data suggested that the overall increased expression of chemokine genes within the CNS of AdCXCL10-infected mice may reflect an enhanced level of neuroinflammation.",

            "text": "Correlating with CXCL10 expression within the CNS of AdCXCL10-infected mice was increased Tcell infiltration at all time points analyzed. Recruitment of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells peaked at 7 days p.i. and although infiltration of both T-cell subsets continued up to 21 days p.i., CD8 + T cells exhibited an enhanced chemotactic response to CXCL10 as compared to CD4 + T cells at the later time points. Both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells have previously been shown to express CXCR3 following viral infection of the CNS, therefore increased infiltration of these cells into the CNS of AdCXCL10-infected mice is not surprising . The prolonged infiltration of CD8 + T cells as compared to CD4 + T cells suggests differential expression profiles for CXCR3 exists on these two populations of lymphocytes. However, the exact reasons for this observation are not understood at this time. The data presented are consistent with a recent report by Boztug et al (2002) that showed increased T-cell accumulation within the CNS of transgenic mice in which CXCL10 is expressed behind the astrocyte-specific promoter glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Interestingly, T cells were unable to penetrate into the parenchyma of the CXCL10-transgenic mice, which is in contrast to the data presented in this report in which inflammatory cells were readily detected within the parencyhma of AdCXCL10-infected mice. Whether differences exist in the extracellular matrix that allow for increased leukocyte infiltration of adenovirus-infected mice as compared to CXCL10transgenic mice remains to be determined. Alternatively, it is possible that mechanical disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) following intracerebral (i.c.) injection of virus contributed to increased T-cell infiltration. However, although compromising the BBB could account for limited T-cell infiltration directly following i.c. infection as is observed in Ad\u03bcgal-infected mice, it is unlikely to account for the persistent T-cell recruitment observed up to 21 days p.i., as shown in AdCXCL10-infected mice. The lack of macrophage infiltration into the CNS of AdCXCL10 or Ad\u03bcgal-infected mice was somewhat surprising given the overall increased expression of the macrophage chemoattractants CCL2 and CCL5 in both populations of mice. Previous studies from our laboratory have indicated that both of these chemokines exert a potent macrophage chemotactic response following viral infection of the CNS Chen et al, 2001) . These results imply that additional factors may be necessary for macrophage trafficking into the CNS following adenovirus infection.",

            "text": "Other studies have utilized either transgenic technology or adenovirus-directed delivery to examine the effects of chemokine/cytokine expression within the CNS. These reports have revealed that chemokine/cytokine expression results in distinct pathologies depending upon the system studied. For example, CNS-targeted expression of TNF-\u03bc or N51/KC resulted in pronounced inflammatory lesions and extensive demyelination and paralysis (Tani et al, 1996; Stalder et al, 1998) . In contrast, other studies have shown that expression of either CXCL10, MIP-2, or transforming growth factor (TGF)\u03bc did not result in any overt pathology within the CNS (Boztug et al, 2002; Bell et al, 1996; Pang et al, 2000) . The dramatic difference in results appears to be dependent upon the activation state of the infiltrating cell type. Indeed, instillation of N51/KC and TNF-\u03bc results in recruitment and activation of neutrophils and macrophages, respectively (Tani et al, 1996; Stalder et al, 1998) . In contrast, expression of MIP-2, a chemokine that is responsible for neutrophil chemotaxis but not activation, resulted in robust neutrophil accumulation within the CNS but no observable neuropathology (Bell et al, 1996) . In addition, recent investigations have indicated that intraparenchymal instillation of chemokines can induce a directional migration of leukocytes into the CNS. For example, microinjection of C10 results in the recruitment of macrophages and T cells, suggesting that injection of a single chemokine can influence cellular trafficking into the target organ (Asensio et al, 1999) .",

However, T-cell infiltration only marginally enhances additional chemokine production and does not result in macrophage recruitment. Therefore, the ability of T cells within the CNS to trigger robust neuropathology appears to be dependent on their activation status, which is related to their ability to secrete additional chemokines/cytokines that lead to the development of neurologic disease. Based on a historical perspective, additional factors that trigger lymphocyte activation (as defined by proliferation and cytokine production) would include a virus capable of replication, e.g., MHV, or a previously defined endogenous antigens that are capable of eliciting an inflammatory response within the CNS, such as myelin basic protein (MBP) or proteolipid protein (PLP). In the absence of such potent stimulation, infiltrating T cells remain somewhat inert and are not able to contribute to tissue destruction.",
