A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) bind the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A (PKA) to localize and organize cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling during diverse physiological processes. Among more than 43 AKAP isoforms, AKAP7 appears to be unique in its homology to viral 2=,5=-PDEs. Here we show that mouse AKAP7 rapidly degrades 2-5A with kinetics similar to that of murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus [MHV]) strain A59 ns2 and human rotavirus strain WA VP3 proteins. To determine whether AKAP7 could substitute for a viral 2=,5=-PDE, we inserted AKAP7 cDNA into an MHV genome with an inactivated ns2 gene. The AKAP7 PDE domain or N-terminally truncated AKAP7 (both lacking a nuclear localization motif), but not full-length AKAP7 or a mutant, AKAP7 H185R , PDE domain restored the infectivity of ns2 mutant MHV in bone marrow macrophages and in livers of infected mice. Interestingly, the AKAP7 PDE domain and N-terminally deleted AKAP7 were present in the cytoplasm (the site of MHV replication), whereas full-length AKAP7 was observed only in nuclei. We suggest the possibility that viral acquisition of the host AKAP7 PDE domain might have occurred during evolution, allowing diverse RNA viruses to antagonize the RNase L pathway.",

            "text": "H ost antiviral pathways triggered by type I interferons (IFNs) are self-limiting so that after virus is eliminated, the host can restore normal cellular and tissue functions (1) . Many types of viruses also prevent activation of host antiviral pathways (reviewed in reference 2). The 2=,5=-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase (OAS)/RNase L system is one of the principal mediators of the IFN antiviral response (reviewed in references 3 to 6). Recently, we reported that two homologous viral proteins from unrelated viruses, coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 ns2 and group A rotavirus strain SA11 VP3, have 2=,5=phosphodiesterase (2=,5=-PDE) activities that antagonize the antiviral activity of RNase L by degrading 2-5A [p x (5=A2=p) n 5=A, where x is 1 to 3 and n is 2 or greater] (7, 8) . ns2 and VP3 are eukaryotic-viral LigT-like family members that include both viral and cellular proteins of diverse origins, some of which possess cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CPD) activity ( Fig. 1A) (9) . LigT proteins are named for the prototypical archeo-bacterial tRNA-ligating enzyme LigT with reversible 2=-5=-RNA ligase activity (10) and are part of a larger superfamily of 2H phosphoesterases characterized by the presence of a pair of conserved His-h-Thr/Ser-h motifs (where h is typically a hydrophobic residue) (9, 11, 12) . However, while MHV ns2 has 2=,5=-PDE activity, it apparently lacks CPD activity based on its inability to cleave 2=,3= cyclic AMP (cAMP), 3=,5= cAMP, and ADP-ribose 1\u0409,2\u0409 cyclic phosphate (7) . Mutation of the active site of ns2 blocked MHV replication in liver, thereby preventing hepatitis in wild-type (wt) mice but not in RNasel \u03ea/\u03ea mice (7) . Furthermore, the group A rotavirus (strain SA11) VP3 C-terminal domain (CTD) was able to restore the replication and virulence of a chimeric ns2 mutant MHV in mice (8) , showing that these two virally encoded activities are functionally equivalent. Homologous PDEs encoded by other 2a betacoronaviruses, toroviruses, and group A rotaviruses suggest that this is a general mechanism of host antagonism necessary for replication of many RNA viruses (5, 8, 9, 11; unpublished data) .",

            "text": "Several other AKAPs also bind to different cyclic nucleotide PDEs (reviewed in reference 16). However, among more than 43 known AKAP family members (13) , only long isoforms of AKAP7 (also known as AKAP15 or -18) have a central domain (CD) with two characteristic His-h-Thr/Ser-h motifs and predicted structural homology to the viral 2=,5=-PDEs MHV ns2 and rotavirus VP3 ( Fig. 1A and see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) (9, 12, 18) . Therefore, we explored the possibility that instead of binding an extrinsic PDE like other AKAPs, AKAP7 might have an intrinsic PDE activity. There are four splice variants of AKAP7: (i) two short forms of 15 and 18 kDa (\u2423 and \u2424) that have a membranetargeting region and the PKA binding motif but lack the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and CD and (ii) two long forms of 37 and 42 kDa (\u2425 and \u2426) that contain (from the N to the C terminus) an NLS, the CD, and the AKAP helix and leucine zipper that bind R subunits of PKA and also Ca 2\u03e9 and Na \u03e9 channels (18)\u044c A recent report described a cre/loxP knockout in mice of AKAP7 exon 7 FIG 1 AKAP7 rapidly degrades 2-5A with kinetics similar to those of MHV strain A59 ns2 and human rotavirus strain WA VP3-CTD.

Results are averages of values from three biological replicates, and the error bars are the standard deviations (SD). (C to E) Purified (2=-5=)p 3 A 3 (10 M) was incubated with 1.5 M purified ns2, AKAP7, or AKAP7 H93A;H185R , respectively, at 22\u00b0C. At the times indicated (to the right), the reactions were stopped. The substrate, (2'-5')p 3 A 3 , and its degradation products (2=-5=)p 3 A 2 , 5=-AMP, and 5=-ATP (as indicated) were separated by HPLC. Elution times are shown on the x axes. OD 260 , optical density at 260 nm; mAU, arbitrary units (in thousands). (F) The percentage of intact (2=-5=)p 3 A 3 remaining was determined from areas under the peaks from chromatograms using 32 Karat software (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) and is plotted as a function of time. (G) Western blot analysis of AKAP7 proteins stably expressed in human Hey1B cells as determined by probing with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against AKAP7 peptide B (see Materials and Methods). (H) Levels of 2-5A in Hey1B cells expressing different AKAP7 proteins (or vector control cells) transfected with pIC, as determined by FRET assays (see Materials and Methods). Results are averages from three biological replicates. Error bars represent SD. from all four AKAP7 splice variants (19) . AKAP7 exon 7 encodes the C-terminally modified leucine zipper domain that binds the RI/RII PKA subunits, Ca 2\u03e9 and Na \u03e9 channels, and the 3= untranscribed region (3=-UTR). The AKAP7-deficient animals were, however, phenotypically normal. In particular, cardiomyocytes from AKAP7-deficient mice responded normally to adrenergic stimulation, leading the authors to suggest that another AKAP isoform performs this function (19) . Here we investigated the possible role of AKAP7 in a biochemical function alternative to regulating cAMP signaling, namely, regulating 2-5A signaling to RNase L. We determined that the AKAP7 CD is a 2=,5=-PDE that rapidly degrades 2-5A. As a result, replication of an ns2 mutant MHV was restored by the AKAP7 CD or by an N-terminally truncated AKAP7 that retains the CD, both of which localized to the cytosol, the site of viral replication. However, full-length AKAP7 localized to the nucleus and failed to restore replication of ns2 mutant MHV. These studies identify a novel biochemical function of an AKAP family member and are consistent with the possibility that the AKAP7 CD has been acquired by some viruses to evade the antiviral activity of type I IFNs by preventing activation of RNase L (7, 8) . In addition, our findings suggest that localization of 2-5A-degrading enzymes near sites of viral RNA synthesis may negate the antiviral activity of RNase L.",

To determine whether murine AKAP7 is a 2=,5=-PDE, cDNA encoding full-length AKAP7\u2425 (hereinafter \"AKAP7\" unless stated otherwise) was expressed in bacteria, purified, and tested for its ability to cleave the trimeric species of 2-5A, (2=-5=)p 3 A 3 , in vitro. Wild-type (wt) AKAP7, AKAP7 mutated in both conserved histidines (AKAP7 H93A;H185R ), and, for comparison, MHV strain A59 ns2 and human rotavirus strain WA VP3-CTD ( Fig. 1A) were incubated with (2=-5=)p 3 A 3 at 37\u00b0C. 2-5A levels were measured by activation of RNase L in vitro in comparison to a standard curve of 2-5A dilutions using a previously described fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) method (20) . ns2, VP3, and AKAP7 (each at 1.5 M) rapidly degraded (2=-5=)p 3 A 3 (10 M) such that after a 1-min incubation at 37\u00b0C, less than 30% of the input (2=-5=)p 3 A 3 remained intact (Fig. 1B) . Little or no detectable 2-5A remained after 10 min of incubation with any of the three proteins. In contrast, AKAP7 mutated in the two conserved histidine residues lacked the ability to degrade 2-5A (Fig. 1B) .",

Hey1B cells were selected for these experiments because endogenous AKAP7 was undetectable by Western blotting with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against an AKAP7 CD peptide (Fig. 1G ). Ectopic expression of the different AKAP7 proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting ( Fig. 1G ). At 20 h posttransfection with either an empty vector or the AKAP7 cDNAs, cells were transfected for an additional 3 h with the synthetic doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) poly(rI) \u00b7 poly(rC) (pIC), a potent activator of OAS (22). 2-5A was undetectable in control cells transfected with the vector alone as determined by FRET (the lower limit of detection was about 15 fmol/10 6 cells) (Fig. 1H ). However, pIC caused high levels of 2-5A (38 pmol/10 6 cells) to accumulate in the vector control cells. In contrast, expression of the AKAP7 CD reduced pIC induction of 2-5A by almost 200-fold (to 0.2 pmol/10 6 cells). The full-length AKAP7 reduced pIC-induced levels of 2-5A by about 12-fold (to 3 pmol/10 6 cells), while fulllength mutant AKAP7 H93A;H185R failed to deplete pIC-induced levels of 2-5A (26 pmol/10 6 cells remaining).

We hypothesized that the expression of AKAP7 from a chimeric ns2 mutant MHV would restore viral replication in B6 bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM). Four MHV-AKAP7 chimeric viruses, all based on the ns2 H126R mutant MHV, were constructed ( Fig. 2A ) by inserting coding sequences for full-length AKAP7 (ns2 H126R -AKAP7), AKAP7 with an N-terminal domain (NTD) truncation (ns2 H126R -AKAP7 \u232cNTD ), the AKAP7 CD (ns2 H126R -AKAP7 CD ), or a mutant AKAP7 CD (ns2 H126R -AKAP7 CD H185R ) into the MHV nonessential ns4 gene ( Fig. 2A) . BMM (Rnasel \u03ea/\u03ea ) were infected with each chimeric virus, as well as with control wt A59 and ns2 H126R , for 10 h at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. All viruses expressed similar levels of ns2 and AKAP7 proteins of the expected sizes in infected BMM as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 2B ).",

Full-length AKAP7 has an NLS sequence at its N terminus which was deleted from the other AKAP7 constructs ( Fig. 1A and 2A) . We compared the subcellular localizations of the AKAP7 proteins expressed by each of the chimeric viruses. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis with antibody against an AKAP7 CD peptide was carried out in 17CL-1 fibroblasts and BMM, neither of which expresses a detectable level of endogenous AKAP7. Full-length AKAP7 was located in the nuclei of both 17Cl-1 and B6 BMM, as was previously reported ( Fig. 3A and B) (24) . The N-terminal deletion (\u232cNTD) including the NLS caused the truncated AKAP7 protein to localize exclusively to the cytoplasm of 17Cl-1 cells but to both the nuclei and the cytoplasm of BMM ( Fig. 3A and B and data not shown). The CD of AKAP7 and its mutant (also missing the NLS) localized to the cytoplasm of 17Cl-1 cells but, like AKAP7 \u232cNTD , localized to both the cytoplasm and the nuclei of BMM. Likewise, the ns2 protein was clearly cytoplasmic in 17Cl-1 cells but present in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm of BMM. To confirm these findings, human 293T cells were stably transfected with cDNA expressing full-length AKAP7, the AKAP7 CD, or, as a control, the empty vector. Western blots showed that the 293T cells also failed to express detectable levels of endogenous AKAP7, whereas both AKAP7 and AKAP7 CD were clearly present in the transfected cells (Fig. 3C ). As expected, full-length AKAP7 localized to the nuclei, whereas AKAP7 CD, which lacks the NLS, localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3D) . These studies show that expressed full-length AKAP7 is nuclear but that deletion of its NLS causes some or all of the truncated protein to localize to the cytoplasm, depending on the cell type.",

To determine the effect of AKAP7 on viral replication, BMM from wt B6 or Rnasel \u03ea/\u03ea mice were infected with AKAP7 chimeric viruses or with control wt A59 and mutant ns2 H126R . As expected, the replication of ns2 H126R was severely impaired (by 3 log 10 units) compared to that of wt A59 in B6 BMM (Fig. 4A) , consistent with the results of our previous studies (7, 8, 25) . Intriguingly, chimeric ns2 H126R -AKAP7 was unable to rescue replication in B6 BMM, demonstrating that the expression of fulllength AKAP7 does not confer a wild-type level of replication in B6 BMM. In contrast, viruses expressing either the N-terminally deleted AKAP7 (ns2 H126R -AKAP7 \u232cNTD ) or AKAP7 CD (ns2 H126R -AKAP7 CD ) replicated to levels similar to those of wt A59, showing that either of these truncated forms of AKAP7 can compensate for the inactive ns2 H126R PDE. However, when catalytic histidine residue 185 in the AKAP7 CD was mutated, replication of the chimeric ns2 H126R -AKAP7 CD H185R virus was impaired to an extent similar to that with the ns2 H126R mutant. As expected, however, all of these chimeric viruses replicated efficiently, to an extent and with kinetics similar to those of wt A59 in BMM derived from Rnasel \u03ea/\u03ea mice (Fig. 4B) . These results show that expression of the N-terminal truncation or of the CD of AKAP7, both of which lack the NLS and are present in the cytoplasm, can restore the function of ns2 in the mutant virus, whereas full-length AKAP7, which localizes to the nuclei, cannot. In addition, the ability of the AKAP7 CD to rescue ns2 mutant MHV is dependent on a catalytic histidine residue.",

In vitro, enzymes with 5=-phosphatase activity, such as alkaline phosphatase, can remove the 5=-triphosphate moiety of 2-5A, thus eliminating, or greatly reducing, the ability of the core 2=,5=-oligoadenylate to activate RNase L (31). In addition, porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) gene 7 protein has been reported to dephosphorylate 2-5A through its interactions with protein phosphatase PP1 (32) . Two mammalian PDEs, PDE12 (2=-PDE) (33) (34) (35) in the exonucleaseendonuclease-phosphatase family of deadenylases and ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) (36) , have been shown to degrade 2-5A in vitro. PDE12 is a mitochondrial protein with both 2=,5=-and 3=,5=-PDE activities that removes poly(A) tails from mitochondrial mRNAs (34, 35) . ENPP1 has a catalytic domain that is extracellular and is therefore essentially an extracellular enzyme; in addition to degrading 2-5A, it cleaves phosphodiester bonds in 3=,5= RNA, DNA, and cAMP (36) . In contrast to PDE12 and ENPP1, which have mitochondrial and extracellular locations, respectively, OAS proteins localize to either the cytoplasm or nuclei, also sites of virus replication (37, 38) . Our findings here demonstrate that AKAP7 is an additional host enzyme with 2=,5=-PDE activity.

Using the same antibody, we were able to detect low levels of AKAP7 in Hey1b cells and BMM. However, AKAP7 mRNA is not induced by wt A59 or ns2 mutant infection (unpublished data). Thus, AKAP7 may be functional at a low expression level, may be expressed at higher levels in some tissues (presently under investigation), and/or may be induced by cytokines or other soluble mediators not induced by MHV. Cytoplasmic expression of the AKAP7 PDE rescues ns2 mutant MHV. AKAP7 is one of a relatively few members of the AKAP family that localizes to the nucleus (24, 39) . Although expressed full-length AKAP7 traffics to nuclei, the AKAP7 central PDE domain typically localizes to the cytoplasm, or to both the cytoplasm and nuclei, after the N-terminal NLS is deleted (Fig. 3) (24). 2-5A produced in the cytoplasm during viral infections might be expected to transit nuclear pores, leading to its degradation by endogenous nuclear AKAP7. However, expression of full-length AKAP7 failed to rescue ns2 mutant MHV or to prevent RNase L activation in the infected wt BMM. In contrast, the AKAP7 CD rapidly degraded 2-5A, preventing activation of RNase L and restoring the ability of an ns2 mutant MHV to replicate in vitro and in vivo. MHV RNA replication occurs completely in the cytoplasm of transformed cell lines (40) , and the local requirement for degradation of 2-5A may not be so surprising. Nilsen and Baglioni (41) proposed, based in part on their experiments with encephalomyocarditis virus, that microdomains (localized accumulations) of 2-5A occur at the sites of viral double-stranded replication intermediates (RI), where OAS binds and is activated, causing localized activation of RNase L. Thus, 2=,5=-PDE activity may be required in the same subcellular compartment as viral RNA replication to effectively antagonize RNase L activation, as measured by virus rescue as well as protection of rRNA. These findings raise the possibility of an additional, yet-to-be identified isoform of AKAP7 that retains the CD but localizes to the cytoplasm. Alternatively, AKAP7 may be relevant to viruses that replicate in nuclei but not to viruses, such as coronaviruses or rotaviruses, that replicate in the cytoplasm. It remains to be determined, however, whether the endogenous, nuclear AKAP7 has any role in viral infections. Alternatively, it is also possible that AKAP7 functions to degrade nuclear 2-5A or 2-5A-like molecules that might be produced during nonviral cellular responses to stress (42) . However, full-length AKAP7 was able to degrade 2-5A in cells transfected with pIC, although less effectively than the AKAP7 CD, perhaps due to some leakage of the overexpressed AKAP7 into the cytoplasm (Fig. 1H) . Moreover, the intracellular localizations of transfected pIC and the MHV RI are likely to be different. In addition, posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may cause AKAP7 to relocate to different intracellular sites, as suggested for the AKAP species Chd8 (39) .",

This is similar to our findings with VP3-CTD/MHV chimeric viruses, which reached liver titers similar to those of the AKAP7-CD chimeras (8) . The reduction in viral titers is most likely due to attenuation associated with disturbing the genome in the region of gene 4, which is not required for viral replication or virulence (43) . This explanation is supported by our finding that a virus expressing wt ns2 and mutant VP3-CTD from the gene 4 position is as attenu-ated as virus expressing mutant ns2 and wt VP3-CTD from the gene 4 position (data not shown). Because the replication of these chimeric viruses in the liver is so much less robust than that of wt A59, it was not possible to determine whether expression of foreign PDEs fully confers hepatitis on the ns2 H126R mutant.",

Most, if not all, studies of localization of MHV-encoded proteins or membrane rearrangement have been carried out with transformed cell lines, and there is little information on infection of primary cells such as BMM. Interestingly, full-length AKAP7 retains its exclusively nuclear localization in BMM, whereas the N-terminally deleted AKAP7 and AKAP7 CD as well as ns2 were present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 3B) . Future studies will be directed at comparing the subcellular localization of proteins and replication complexes in MHV-infected primary cells to those in transformed cell lines.

Group 2a betacoronaviruses, which have plus-strand RNA genomes, and the group A rotaviruses, with segmented dsRNA genomes, are unrelated RNA viruses with different replication strategies, yet both encode related 2=,5=-PDEs, ns2 and VP3, respectively (7, 8) . Here we present the first evidence that a viral pathogen for humans, the rotavirus strain WA (46), also encodes a functional 2=,5=-PDE (Fig. 1B) . In addition, many related viruses encode predicted or confirmed 2=,5=-PDEs, including additional 2a betacoronaviruses, human OC43 and HEC4408, bovine coronavirus, porcine hemagglutinating virus, the torovirus and coronavirus superfamily member equine torovirus (Berne), and group A, B, and G rotaviruses (reviewed in reference 5). While the evolutionary origins of these viral 2=,5=-PDEs are unknown, we suggest that the host AKAP7 2=,5=-PDE domain coding sequence might have been captured through RNA recombination during viral infections in the distant past. Alternatively, the viral PDEs may have evolved from other vertebrate 2H phosphoesterases (9). The phylogenetic relationship of different species of AKAP7, VP3 and ns2, based on protein sequence data was explored by means of fast minimum evolution (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). While this analysis shows a close relationship among different species of AKAP7, VP3, pp1a, and ns2, it does not reveal whether this relationship is the result of divergent or convergent evolution (Fig. S3) . Coronavirus mRNAs are transcribed from their genomes by a discontinuous process believed to involve switching of template by the viral replicase complex. During this process, there is a high rate of homologous recombination, reportedly up to 25%, observed during in vitro replication and in vivo (reviewed in reference 47); this high-frequency template switching may result in low-frequency copying of host mRNA. Indeed, sequences homologous to the 5= end of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I coding regions are found on the 5= end of the MHV HE gene, adjacent to the 3= end of the ns2 open reading frame, and it was previously speculated that this was a result of homologous recombination between the MHV genome and host RNA (48) . We suggest that AKAP7 PDE sequences have been acquired by a similar process and subsequently evolved into ns2. In support of this idea, an alignment of the amino acid sequences of different isoforms of AKAP7, ns2 and VP3, show extensive homology that extends beyond the His-h-Thr/Ser-h motifs (Fig. S1 ). Subsequent to randomly acquiring the AKAP7 CD coding sequence, the virus would have a selective advantage resulting in retention of the gene.",

The histidine residues at positions 93 and 185 were mutated with a QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) to generate pGEX-AKAP7 (H93A H185R). Plasmid pMAL-ns2 was described previously (7) . The cDNA encoding the C-terminal domain (CTD) of human rotavirus WA strain VP3 (amino acids 691 to 835) (Virus Sequence Database accession number JX406749) was optimized for bacterial expression, synthetically made (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ), cloned in a pMal parallel vector, and expressed as a maltose binding protein fusion protein with a TEV cleavable tag, as we previously described for SA11 VP3-CTD (8) . For Hey1b transient transfections, the murine AKAP7 full-length coding sequence was PCR amplified from the entry vector pENTR223.1 and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS, generating pC-AKAP7. The histidine residues at positions 93 and 185 were mutated to generate pC-AKAP7(H93A; H185R), and a Flag tag sequence for the C terminus was added. The CD region of murine AKAP7 (corresponding to amino acids 48 to 253) was PCR amplified from the full-length construct with a Flag epitope sequence added to the C terminus and cloned into pCAGGS, generating pC-AKAP7 CD. For 293T stable cells lines, the lentivirus vector pLentiCMV-Puro-DEST, from Eric Campeau (52) , pCMV-VSV-G, expressing vesicular stomatitis virus G envelope protein, and the pCMV-dR8.2 packaging plasmid, from Robert Weinberg (53), were obtained from Addgene.

At 5 days postinfection, the mice were sacrificed and perfused with PBS. The livers were removed, homogenized, and titrated by plaque assays on L2 cells as previously described (57). All mouse experiments were reviewed and approved by the University of Pennsylvania IACUC.",
