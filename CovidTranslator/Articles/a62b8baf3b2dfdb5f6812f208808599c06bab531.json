The subspecies L. japonica Thunb. var. sempervillosa Hayata (LJv) is a variant that mainly grows in Taiwan. This study examined the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the extracts from the flower buds of these two species. The extracts were obtained by three extraction methods: water extraction, ethanol extraction, and supercritical-CO 2 fluid extraction (SFE). The antioxidant activities of dry LJ (dLJ) extracts were superior to those of LJv extracts. Water extracts possessed higher activities than that prepared by ethanol or SFE. The total polyphenols content, total flavonoids content, and the amount of chlorogenic acid and luteolin-7-O-glucoside were all higher in the water extracts compared to the other two. The SFE extracts of these two species all exhibited excellent anti-inflammatory activities. Although the water and ethanol extracts of dLJ extracts had higher anti-inflammatory activity than that of LJv extracts, the SFE extracts prepared from fresh LJv flower buds (fLJv) exhibited the highest activity among all extracts. The SFE effectively isolates the bioactive components of L. japonica and can obtain the L. japonica extracts with high anti-inflammatory activity.",

Dong. It is a traditional Chinese medicine endowing with antidote, diuretic, tonic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory and anti-infectious activities. It has been widely used in treating exopathogenic windheat, furuncles, epidemic febrile diseases, carbuncles, sores and some infectious diseases. It is also applied to treat chronic enteritis, pneumonia, acute tonsillitis, nephritis, acute mastitis, leptospirosis in some folk prescriptions. Recent uses include the prevention and treatment of human and animal viruses, such as SARS coronavirus and swine H1N1 flu virus (Shang et al., 2011) . Several pharmacological studies have shown that LJ and its active ingredients possess wide bioactivities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, blood fat reducing, antipyretic and antiendotoxin (Shang et al., 2011) . Therefore, in addition to its folk medicinal uses, LJ is also used in health food and cosmetics. More than 150 chemical compounds have been isolated from LJ. The major compositions are essential oils, flavones, saponins, iridoids, and organic acids. Chlorogenic acid, luteolin, luteolin-7-Oglucoside and essential oils have good pharmacological effects and are believed to be the active ingredients of LJ (Ikeda et al., 1994; http://dx.doi.org/10.1016 /j.indcrop.2016 .010 0926-6690/\u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. Wang, 2010) . Different plant parts, including flowers, flower buds, leaves and whole plant, contain different ingredients and have different activities. Among them, flowers and flower buds of LJ are the most frequently used plant parts in Taiwan. However, differences in habitat, harvest time, extraction methods, and flower preparation (fresh versus dry) also cause variations in chemical compositions and the quality of LJ extract (Shang et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "The L. japonica is usually extracted with water or organic solvents, such as methanol or ethanol. One alternative to traditional extraction by organic solvents is supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). The most commonly used supercritical fluid is CO 2 because of its favorable operating temperature and pressure for extracting thermolabile ingredients. Supercritical CO 2 is also non-toxic, non-flammable, widely available, chemically inert, and has low viscosity, low surface tension, high diffusivity and favorable density (Wang, 2011; Quitain et al., 2013) . Compared to conventional organic solvent extraction methods, the advantages of SFE are its non-toxicity and high separation selectivity. Especially, the CO 2 gas used in SFE operation can be easily recycled to avoid the concern of greenhouse effects. Therefore, the use of SFE for extracting natural products is rapidly increasing (King, 2014; Uddin et al., 2015; Yen et al., 2015) .",

The dLJ contained higher amounts of chlorogenic acid, secologanic acid and epi-vogeloside than those of the other two. Chlorogenic acid and luteolin-7-O-glucoside are the bioactive components of LJ and are known to have potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities (Choi et al., 2007; Huo et al., 2003; Guo et al., 2014) . Further analyses for determining their concentrations were performed by HPLC. The chlorogenic acid concentration of dLJv, fLJv and dLJ ethanol (75%) extracts were 0.89%, 0.21% and 1.75%, respectively. The luteolin-7-O-glucoside concentration of dLJv, fLJv and dLJ ethanol (75%) extracts were 0.017%, 0.009% and 0.035%, respectively. The dLJ extracts had the highest chlorogenic acid content and the highest luteolin-7-O-glucoside content, which partly explains why the dLJ extracts had the best antioxidant activity.",

Aqueous extract of LJ also attenuated trypsin-induced mast HMC-1 cell activation through inhibition of ERK phosphorylation and the inhibition of trypsin activity (Kang et al., 2004) . Water extract of LJ inhibited both COX-1 and COX-2 activity, the expression of IL-1\u2424induced COX-2 protein and mRNA in A549 cells (Xu et al., 2007) .

In terms of anti-inflammatory activity, SFE was a good separation tool that provided excellent activities of L. japonica extracts. Since SFE concentrates non-polar bioactive components of LJ and LJv in the extraction step, it can obtain the extracts with high anti-inflammatory activity. Additionally, SFE is non-toxic, non-flammable, and easy recycle use of CO 2 .
