Then, the calves were fed milk from buckets thrice daily at approximately 3% of body weight per feeding until 3 days of life. After this time, the calves were fed a milk replacer (thrice daily and approximately 10% of body weight per day) and calf starter (including concentrate (90% DM) and high-quality alfalfa (10% DM)) until 90 days of life.

Fecal scores 1 and 2 were considered as diarrheic. The diarrheic calves, before any treatment, were clinically examined, and clinical data (rectal temperature, fecal consistency score, and presence of visible blood in feces) as well as data on sex, age, and days between disease onset and sampling were recorded per calf. After clinical examination, rectal fecal samples and jugular vein blood samples in tubes containing EDTA and plane tubes, free from anticoagulant, were collected from the calves. Also, the electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded from each of the calves on a bipolar base apex lead using limb lead. Animals were kept in a standing position in a stock without any sedation. The ECG was recorded when the animals were thought to be in a quiet state using an alligator-type electrode attached to the skin. The positive electrode of lead I (left arm) was attached to the skin of the fifth intercostal space just caudal to the olecranon and the negative electrode (right arm) on the jugular furrow about the lower 1/3 of the left side of the neck, and the earth was attached away from these two electrodes (Rezakhani et al. 2004 ). All ECGs were obtained on a triple-channel ECG machine (Cardioline, Delta 1 Plus, Remco, Italy) with a paper speed of 25 mm/s and calibration of 10 mm equal to 1 mV.",

Because of the importance and high prevalence of enterotoxigenic E. coli, the presence of E. coli (k99) in fecal samples was also evaluated, and E. coli (K99) positive samples were deleted from both groups.",

            "text": "In diarrheic calves, electrolyte imbalance and acidosis affect cardiac function, and cardiac arrhythmia is one of the main causes of death in diarrheic calves (Naylor et al. 2006 ). In the current study, ECG records were used for the evaluation and comparison of cardiac function between the two groups. From our results, significant differences there were seen between the two groups for the amplitude of P and QRS waves and the duration of T wave. Group B had a lower mean heart rate, which seems to cause a longer T wave duration in this group. Although differences of serum electrolytes between the two groups were not statistically significant, the difference of the P wave amplitude may be due to the different serum concentrations of some electrolytes. Hyperkalemia is the first suspect for ECG changes during calf diarrhea. The serum potassium level of group B was above the normal (3.9-5.8 mmol/L) (Kaneko et al. 1997) . ECG patterns during the hyperkalemia are largely comparable between different species, and are characterized by a widening and flattening of P wave, broadening of QRS complex, increased P-R interval, shortening of the QT interval as well as tall, symmetric, peaked T waves (Pourjafar et al. 2008) . No probable cause for the change in the QRS complex amplitude was found. According to our results, ECG patterns during calf diarrhea may be suitable as an indicator of the severity of serum electrolyte changes and can be used to estimate the severity of illness in diarrheic calves. Although some researchers observed no significant correlation between blood electrolytes and ECG parameters in diarrheic calves (Dalir Naghadeh and Yaresmaeil 2001) , Gertsch (2009) believes that although the correlation between definitively pathologic electrolyte serum levels and the ECG is poor (10-30%), severe or extreme electrolyte imbalance is detectable in the ECG up to 90%.",
