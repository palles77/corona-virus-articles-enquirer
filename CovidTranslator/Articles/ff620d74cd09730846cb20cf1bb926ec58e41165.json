Here, we characterize a canine alphacoronavirus, designated CCoV-A76, first isolated in 1976. Serological studies show that CCoV-A76 is distinct from other CCoVs, such as the prototype CCoV-1-71. Efficient replication of CCoV-A76 is restricted to canine cell lines, in contrast to the prototypical type II strain CCoV-1-71 that more efficiently replicates in feline cells. CCoV-A76 can use canine aminopeptidase N (cAPN) receptor for infection of cells, but was unable to use feline APN (fAPN). In contrast, CCoV-1-71 can utilize both. Genomic analysis shows that CCoV-A76 possesses a distinct spike, which is the result of a recombination between type I and type II CCoV, that occurred between the N-and C-terminal domains (NTD and C-domain) of the S1 subunit. These data suggest that CCoV-A76 represents a recombinant coronavirus form, with distinct host cell tropism.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses which infect humans and a variety of non-primate mammals, including canines (Lai and Holmes, 2001; Perlman et al., 2008) . Research on these viruses has greatly increased since 2003 due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic caused by a zoonotic transmission of an animal coronavirus into the human population (Eaton and Wang, 2007) . Coronaviruses are phylogenetically divided into several genera termed alpha, beta, gamma and delta (King et al., 2011) . There are two known coronavirus species that infect dogs: a newly identified betacoronavirus termed canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), and a more characterized alphacoronavirus termed canine enteric coronavirus (CCoV) . Within the CCoV alphacoronavirus species, there are two distinct serotypes (type I and type II), with both forms of CCoV transmitted via a fecal-oral route . CCoV is usually thought to cause only mild to inapparent enteritis (Pollock and Carmichael, 1983) . However, in some cases CCoV infection can be fatal in young dogs, in particular when coinfections occur with canine parvovirus or other pathogens (Pratelli et al., 1999) . In recent years, an increasing number of highly virulent CCoV infections have also been reported in healthy adult dogs without apparent coinfections (Buonavoglia et al., 2006; Decaro et al., 2007; Escutenaire et al., 2007; Evermann et al., 2005; Naylor et al., 2002; Sanchez-Morgado et al., 2004; Zappulli et al., 2008) . In some of these cases, these new pathogenic viruses are able to spread to other organs and are thought to be novel recombinant forms of CCoV, such as the CCoV type IIb viruses that are more closely related to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of pigs Decaro et al., 2009; Erles and Brownlie, 2009; Ntafis et al., 2011) . The emergence of such highly virulent isolates of CCoV has significantly renewed interest in this group of viruses.",

CCoV type I and CCoV type II are closely related to each other except for markedly different spike proteins and the presence of an additional open reading frame (ORF3) in CCoV type I isolates (Lorusso et al., 2008) . This is analogous to the situation with feline coronavirus (FCoV), which also exist as two serotypes (type I FCoV and type II FCoV) based on distinct spike proteins (Haijema, et al., 2007) . It has been proposed that type I CCoVs and FCoVs evolved from a common ancestral virus, and that the canine and feline type II lineages arose from multiple recombination events with an unidentified genetic source (Lorusso et al., 2008) . Also closely related to the CCoV/FCoV type II lineage is TGEV, whose origin is unclear but which may have arisen from zoonotic transfer of a type II CCoV to pigs (Lorusso et al., 2008) .",

Aminopeptidase N (APN) has been shown to act as a cellular receptor for FCoV, CCoV and TGEV . Although each virus would be assumed to utilize a species-specific homolog in its respective host during in vivo infection, the feline homolog (fAPN) can act, in vitro, as a common receptor for type II FCoV, type II CCoV and TGEV (Tresnan et al., 1996) . This situation is unlike the one found for most other coronaviruses, which have highly species-specific receptors. This broad receptor binding ability likely plays a role in the zoonotic transfer and genetic recombination events that have defined the evolution of animal alphacoronaviruses. In the case of the serotype I FCoV/CCoV group, the receptor determinants are much less certain. While there is some evidence for fAPN as an FCoV type I receptor (Tresnan et al., 1996) , other studies have concluded that there is a distinct receptor for FCoV type I (Dye et al., 2007; Hohdatsu et al., 1998) . Receptor determinants for CCoV type I remain essentially unknown. In addition to a specific proteinaceous receptor, there are indications that lectin-based interactions via sugar moieties, on either the virus or the host, may play a role in the receptor-binding complex for FCoV types I and II and TGEV (Krempl et al., 1997; Regan et al., 2010; Schultze et al., 1996; Van Hamme et al., 2011) .",

In contrast, type I CCoVs have yet to be easily cultivated in cell culture, and were only recently discovered by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from canine fecal RNA (Pratelli et al., 2003) . CCoV-A76 was isolated from a closed breeding colony of Beagles at the James A. Baker Institute for Animal Health (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY) in 1976. The dogs presented primarily with enteritis, but the virus also appeared to cause additional clinical signs, with significant morbidity in litters of newborn pups exposed to the virus, and with abortions in some pregnant bitches (Carmichael, 1978) . The virus was readily isolated, and was later noted to possess distinct antigenic characteristics as compared to other type II CCoV isolates (Corapi et al., 1992) . CCoV-A76 was archived at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center (College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY) and further characterization was not performed. In light of recent interest in CCoV, we obtained this specimen from the archive for further study. Here, we report data on in vitro growth, antigenic and genomic analysis of CCoV-A76, and show that it represents a recombinant CCoV.",

In general, the sequences for all non-structural and structural proteins, except for the spike, were more related to type II CCoV than to type I ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ), suggesting that the most probable ancestor of CCoV-A76 was a type II virus. Intriguingly, this analysis has shown that the S protein has a sequence that would correspond to an intermediate between prototypical type I and type II CCoVs (CCoV-Elmo/02 and CCoV-1-71 respectively, Supplementary Fig. 1 ).",

            "text": "Because the CCoV-A76 spike sequence did not cluster well with either type I or II CCoVs, and since the spike protein is a determinant of cell tropism and viral pathogenesis, we focused on the spike protein sequence to perform a more extensive phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 5) . Overall, the complete spike protein was distinct from other alphacoronaviruses and did not cluster with either type I or type II CCoVs (Fig. 5A) . Analysis of the S2 (fusion) domain showed that it clustered closely with CCoV type II, FCoV type II and TGEV (Fig. 5B ). In contrast, the S1 (receptor binding) domain clustered with type I CCoV (Elmo/02) and type I FCoV (RM) (Fig. 5C) . Notably, the CCoV-A76 spike sequence lacked a putative furin cleavage site (RRARR) previously shown to be present at the S1/S2 junction of the CCoV type I virus Elmo/02 (de Haan et al., 2008; Pratelli et al., 2003) , indicating it was more similar to CCoV type II viruses that do not contain consensus furin cleavage sites ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Coronavirus S1 domains contain two independent functional sub-domains, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (C-domain) (Peng et al., 2011) . To better characterize CCoV-A76 S1, the NTD and C-domain were independently analyzed by phylogenetic analysis. The CCoV-A76 NTD clustered closely with Elmo/02 and did not cluster with 1-71 (Fig. 5D ). In contrast, the CCoV-A76 C-domain was divergent and did not clearly cluster with any characterized alphacoronavirus (Fig. 5E ). Overall, these data indicate that the CCoV-A76 spike gene is probably a recombinant of a type I CCoV with a type II CCoV spike, with a recombination site located between the NTD and C-domain of S1. To determine possible recombination sites within S1, we used the BOOTSCAN/RESCAN method to identify recombination events and breakpoints in the CCoV-A76 S nucleotide sequence. This analysis confirmed the presence of recombination between the NTD and C-domain, with a breakpoint at nucleotide 890 (Fig. 6 ).",

Immunofluorescence experiments have shown that a panel of antibodies specific for the coronavirus N protein cross reacts with CCoV-A76, but a panel of antibodies specific for the type II FCoV S protein fails to cross react with the virus. Importantly, while both CCoV-A76 and CCoV-1-71-like viruses can infect canine A-72 cells, CCoV-A76 shows distinct and pronounced tropism for a variety of additional dog cell lines (e.g. MDCK), as well as pig cell lines (e.g. LLC-PK1) that the prototypical 1-71-like CCoVs fail to infect. Additionally, CCoV-A76 fails to infect cells of cat origin (e.g. CRFK, AK-D), which are very efficiently infected by 1-71-like CCoVs. These serological data suggested that CCoV-A76 possesses distinct characteristics setting it apart from other known CCoVs. Phylogenetic analysis of the CCoV-A76 genome shows that it is mostly related to type II CCoV, however, analysis of the spike sequence at the amino acid level places CCoV-A76 as an outlier of the CCoV group, suggesting that CCoV-A76 is genetically distinct. Notably, CCoV-A76 is genetically distinct from recently isolated highly virulent type IIb CCoV strains, such as CCoV-CB/05. CCoV-A76 S appears to be a recombinant of a type II and a type IIa CCoV, with recombination occurring between the NTD and C-domain of S1 (Fig. 7) . Further proof of a recombination event occurring at the spike gene of CCoV-A76 was found by analyzing its nucleotide coding sequence. Indeed, in close proximity of the recombination breakpoint identified by the BOOTSCAN/RESCAN methodology (nucleotide 890), several stretches of nucleotides that were either identical (TCTAA, found twice at nucleotide 932 and at nucleotide 972) or near identical (ATAAAAAT at nucleotide 862 and GTAAAATG at nucleotide 990) to characterized CCoV recombination signals (TCTAA and G/CTAAAAA/GT) (Wang and Lu, 2009 ) have been identified (data not shown). The divergent C-domain might also suggest that a second recombination may have occurred at the vicinity of the S1/S2 boundary, with an as yet uncharacterized coronavirus, but evidence for this is currently lacking. Overall, the body of evidence in favor of a recombinant origin for the spike gene of CCoV-A76, together with its distinct antigenic and tropism profiles, argue in favor of setting it apart from other CCoVs as a type I/II canine coronavirus.",

The APNbinding site is within the C-domain of S1 and can be operationally defined as the D3 domain (residues 526-676, based on TGEV nomenclature (Reguera et al., 2011) ). However, individual amino acids within the D3 domain that might confer strict species specificity have not been identified. BLAST analysis based on the amino acid sequence of CCoV-A76 D3 domain shows that it is most similar to type II CCoV, but is clearly divergent (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). It also shows some similarity to porcine coronaviruses, perhaps accounting for the limited tropism seen for porcine cells. The divergent C-domain may impart more strict species specificity to CCoV-A76, via specific interactions within the D3 domain. It is also possible that an interaction between the APN binding site and the distinct CCoV type I-like NTD found in CCoV-A76 might account for the distinct species specificity of this virus. Overall, while CCoV-A76 clearly has a recombinant origin, it should be remembered that the recombination event has not occurred within the known APN-binding domain (D3 domain, residues 526-676), but between the NTD and the C-domain (around residue 297, Fig. 7 ). As such, the recombination event itself is unlikely to be directly responsible for the distinct receptor-binding characteristics of CCoV-A76, which may be caused by D3 domain divergence through missense mutations or via the influence of the distinct NTD.",

Comparing cAPN to fAPN using NetNGlyc glycan prediction software reveals that cAPN is more extensively glycosylated than fAPN (with cAPN having 5 potential glycosylation sites on the solvent exposed domain while fAPN has only 2). In particular, residues 291-293 were shown to control species specificity between human, porcine and feline APN . However, this glycosylation sequon is absent for both fAPN and cAPN. Analysis of the spike-interacting APN domain previously shown to control species specificity (residues 670-840) (Hegyi and Kolb, 1998) reveals the presence of a glycosylation site sequon NTS for cAPN, which is missing in fAPN ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . As with hAPN , this sequon may control the species specificity of APN. However, the effect of this glyscosylation site in the context of infection by CCoV-A76 remains to be tested experimentally.

The phylogenetic analysis was performed using full-length coronavirus spike amino acid sequences (A), the S2 subunit sequences including the transmembrane (TM) and C-termini (CT) (B), the S1 subunit sequences (C), the S1 N-terminal domain (NTD) sequences (D), and the S1 C-terminal domain (C-domain) sequences (E). The sequences used in the analyses are represented for each tree, with the region of spike that is used shown in black, and the region not included shown in gray. The S1/S2 cleavage site of the coronavirus spike protein was used as the delineating site between S1 and S2 domains. Determination of NTD and C-domain of the CoV S1 used in the analysis was performed by alignment of individual spikes with MHV-A59 sequence, which has defined NTD and C-domain sequences. The trees were generated using ClustalX 2.1 with the Neighbor-Joining method and bootstrap values calculated from 2000 trees. Scale bars represent the estimated number of substitutions per site.",

Thus, a likely scenario for the emergence of CCoV-A76 is that CCoV type I and CCoV type II were both circulating in the animal breeding facilities at Cornell University in 1976, with dogs infected simultaneously with both serotypes allowing for recombination between the two distinct spike genes. In this scenario, it is interesting to note that a CCoV type I virus would have been circulating in the dog population long before the identification of the prototype CCoV type I strain Elmo/02 in 2002.",

The full-length nucleotide sequences of CCoV-A76, CCoV-1-71, and CCoV-Elmo/02 spike genes were used to perform a recombination event analysis using the RDP3 software with the BOOTSCAN/RESCAN method. The program detected a possible recombination event between the parental sequences CCoV-1-71 S and CCoV-Elmo/02 S that led to the formation of CCoV-A76 spike. The BOOTSCAN plot display shows the location of the probable recombination event in the alignment, with a breakpoint detected at nucleotide 890 (corresponding to residue 297) of CCoV-A76 S. Fig. 7 .
