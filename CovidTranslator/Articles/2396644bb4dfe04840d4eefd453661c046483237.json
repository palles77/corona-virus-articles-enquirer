This advance originated with basic understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HIV replication and, by any standard, must be considered the quintessential paradigm of modern benchto-bedside research translation. Despite this accomplishment, the HIV epidemic continues to grow with the number of people in need of therapy increasing at a faster rate than the number of people with access to care. Moreover, even in resource-rich regions, the majority of HIV-infected people are not diagnosed, in care and/or on effective therapy 2 . Many factors account for this failure, including the expense of therapy, the side effects of therapy, and the difficulty in adhering to any regimen for years to decades. To tackle this epidemic and perhaps end AIDS in our time, two advances must be made-a vaccine that effectively and durably protects those at risk for HIV acquisition and a therapy that will eradicate the virus in those already infected.",

Why, then, has progress on these most compelling needs been so slow? One obvious general difference between the successful development of ART and the lack of an effective vaccine or cure strategy is that solutions for the latter two problems cannot be found by the study of HIV or HIV-infected cells alone; instead, they must be formulated by analysis of the complex in vivo interactions between the virus and the host.",

For cure, the issues are even more complex, requiring both understanding of the nature and homeostasis of the HIV reservoir in ART-suppressed subjects and development of approaches to activate latent virus and destroy all cells harboring replicating or potentially replicating HIV 4, 5 . Whereas some aspects of this pathophysiology can be investigated in test tubes, attaining the level of understanding necessary to rationally design prophylactic vaccines or clinical interventions for cure requires in vivo analysis. This is a daunting challenge, given that HIV is a human-specific virus that resides largely in difficult-to-reach tissues and that infects and destroys the immune system, leading to hostvirus interactions that are complex and difficult, if not impossible, to 'untangle' .",

Gaining knowledge about HIV transmission and persistence during therapy will require the study of mucosal and lymphoid tissues, but very few groups can routinely access and process such tissues. Clinical studies increasingly require teams of clinical and basic scientists, leading to uncertain academic advancement pathways and sources of support. Translational studies of new concepts are difficult to get through peer review, as they are typically small pilot studies. Investigation in humans also invariably involves risk that deters many funders and that draws attention from multiple oversight committees, which can lead to overwhelming regulatory hurdles. Finally, human studies aimed at defining the biology of HIV infection and/or selecting therapies for future, more definitive clinical trials are expensive, requiring considerably more funds compared to laboratory-and small-animal model-based projects. As is increasingly recognized by the key funders of HIV vaccine and cure research, the traditional academic research model of independent laboratory-and animal model-based research groups funded by small project research grants will not, by itself, achieve the goals of the HIV vaccine and cure agendas. One of the key challenges of our field will be to adapt to the cooperative, multidisciplinary nonhuman primate model and clinical research-oriented science that will be necessary for success. -LP & SD",

But the human trial of the adenovirus 5-HIV vaccine famously failed, a result that would have been predicted by analysis of the inability of this vaccine to protect against CCR5-tropic, chronic aggressive SIVs that cause an infection that more closely resembles HIV infection 11, 12 . Hindsight suggests other mistakes that limited the usefulness of nonhuman primate models in past studies-notably, group sizes that were too small (leading to inconclusive studies) and the use of SIV challenge doses that were unrealistically high in vaccine studies, particularly via the intravenous route. In this regard, recent studies using repeated limited-dose mucosal challenge, which more closely reflects human sexual transmission, and larger group sizes have revealed immune vulnerabilities of highly pathogenic SIV that could not have been appreciated with previous standard approaches, including a vaccine-mediated protection against acquisition of highly pathogenic SIV infection that has clear similarities with the protection observed in the Rv144 human vaccine trial 3, 13 .",

Moreover, both the apparent cure of the 'Berlin patient' and the identification of post-treatment HIV controllers 5 have showed that the HIV reservoir is potentially vulnerable to post-ART control and perhaps clearance. However, capitalizing on these observations will continue to be limited by inherent characteristics of the human 'model' , including a restricted ability to determine cause and effect by active in vivo intervention (any treatment must have both therapeutic potential and an acceptable safety profile), the fact that every human infection is with a different virus, and the fact that researchers often have limited access to human tissues other than blood.

The first is the diversity of influenza viruses in nature, which limits how generalizable findings are from one strain to other strains or subtypes and necessitates experiments in different influenza virus backbones. Second, although several animal models can support the replication of influenza viruses, the extent to which they can be used to study disease or transmission varies, as does the availability of immunologic reagents to charac-terize the host response to infection. In addition, although data from ferrets and monkeys are more relevant to humans than data from mice, the sample size in experiments with these species is often very small because they are expensive to purchase and house.

The advanced technology used nowadays allows us to find sequences that often form new phylogenetic clades clearly different from laboratory strains, so they are unlikely to be contamination artifacts.

Although these patterns have already been investigated with the available methods, we have not seen the same technical revolution in immune diagnostics as in molecular detection, where next-generation sequencing has enhanced the depth of data by orders of magnitude. Therefore, our technical capability to find new virus sequences is no longer the bottleneck; instead, our biggest challenge is to appreciate the medical relevance of our results. Traditionally, it was believed that viruses are not part of the normal flora, causing a sentiment that newly discovered viruses should all be pathogens.

Although some of these studies are aimed primarily at understanding the ecology and evolution of viruses 35 , there is hope (and there are big promises) that virus discovery may give us a head start against the next pandemic to emerge 36 . It is reasonable to endeavor to make a census of all viruses lurking in animal reservoirs, as this will help identify viruses during future outbreaks. For example, our expanded knowledge about bat-borne coronaviruses has made the identification of a new human coronavirus that recently emerged in the Arabian Peninsula much easier than the identification of the SARS coronavirus 10 years ago 37, 38 . But the sequencing of reservoir-borne viruses can only be a very first step in viral risk assessment, as complex processes such as viral entry and virus-host cooperation at the cellular level, as well as the many components of epithelial and systemic host defense versus viral immune evasion, also determine whether a virus can infect and spread in humans. The unfiltered presentation of new viruses can create an unjustified air of alarm, and we should therefore investigate biological functions to provide surrogates of transmission risk along with initial descriptions of reservoir-borne viruses. Initial studies working along these lines have now been published, such as the description of a new henipavirus that seems to lack an essential anti-interferon pro-tein, or a new influenza virus from bats whose replicative proteins seem to function in the context of human cells 39, 40 .",

There is still a genetic terra incognita where we cannot recognize next-generation sequencing reads as viral sequences.

In addition, vaccine formats that might be capable of eliciting strong RSV-neutralizing serum antibody responses in children, comparable to those achieved with antibody immunoprophylaxis (such as parenteral administration of properly folded viral protein subunits formulated with adjuvant), would be difficult to clinically develop, at least in part, because of concerns that these vaccines may potentiate RSV disease. In the 1960s, a formalin-inactivated, alum-adjuvanted whole-virus vaccine was tested in infants and children; however, it not only failed to protect against RSV disease but also resulted in immune-mediated disease enhancement 46 . The subsequent development of animal models of RSV vaccine disease enhancement suggested that parenteral vaccination of RSV-na\u00efve animals with subunit vaccines could result in enhanced pulmonary pathology after RSV challenge 47 . In contrast, live, attenuated RSV vaccines and chimeric viruses expressing RSV antigens 48, 49 did not seem to enhance the risk for RSV disease in vaccinated animals. It is these live, intranasally administered vaccine candidates that have advanced into clinical studies in seronegative infants (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00767416, NCT00686075 and NCT01459198).",

As the humoral response to RSV seems intact in adult patients 53 , it is likely that effective vaccine strategies targeting adult populations will differ from those for infants. The presence of RSV-neutralizing antibody in adults would prevent infection of the upper airways with the live, attenuated RSV vaccines that are being developed for seronegative children. Development of therapeutic interventions for adults will require rapid diagnostics appropriate for this population, as adults shed lower quantities of virus and for shorter periods of time compared to children 54 . Many RSV diagnostics developed for pediatrics (there are about 20 different commercial RSV diagnostic kits) are insufficiently sensitive to detect RSV in adults. PCR methodologies that have allowed detection of RSV in adults are extremely sensitive and have led to observations by some investigators of persistent RSV infection, particularly in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 55 . Persistent infection with RSV remains a controversial topic that, if substantiated and found to be clinically meaningful, could have profound implications for the development of RSV vaccines and therapies.",

These include the lack of a small-animal model that recapitulates human infection and disease, the different human target populations requiring different diagnostics and intervention strategies, and the fact that its pathogenesis and immune responses must be studied in a rather inaccessible compartment such as the human airway. As is the case with other complex pathogens, it will be the consolidation of data from multiple sources each of which independently provides an incomplete picture, along with the application of new technology platforms, that will lead to vaccines and therapies for RSV. In addition, because RSV largely affects the very young and the old, success against RSV will require a commitment to better understanding immune responses to infection early and late in life. -JS",

            "text": "cine recipients were protected against subsequent challenge with the vaccine virus 50 . Past experience with live, attenuated influenza vaccines illustrates the difficulty of identifying correlates of protection for vaccines administered locally. Numerous assays have been evaluated over the past 20 years, including various measures of serum antibody responses, nasal IgA and interferon-g enzyme-linked immunospot assays; however, to date no absolute correlate of protection has been identified for these influenza vaccines. The problem may be that current assay systems are insufficiently sensitive to detect local immune responses. Although it is possible to develop a vaccine without a correlate of activity, it is challenging to do so. The inability to show that a vaccine induces a robust immune response in the majority of recipients makes the decision to proceed into large, expensive efficacy studies very difficult. If a vaccine is licensed and no correlate of immune protection is established, the demonstration that subsequent manufacturing and/or formulation modifications do not have a negative impact on vaccine potency requires the conduct of additional efficacy studies.It would be highly desirable to have an RSV therapeutic capable of reducing disease severity, halting disease progression and/or shortening the time to disease resolution for RSV-infected children after they are diagnosed. This is especially important with the continuing absence of a RSV vaccine. A central concern in RSV antiviral development, however, is whether any antiviral compound can affect disease progression or outcome when administered after a child is symptomatic. A recent study of RSV infection in the US indicated that children brought to emergency departments and pediatric offices often already have moderately severe disease 51 . It has been proposed that RSV pathogenesis, which involves airway obstruction by exudate containing damaged epithelial cells, is driven both by viral replication and the host immune response to infection, so that targeting one and not the other would fail to provide therapeutic benefit. Much of what we understand about RSV pathogenesis, and the role of host responses in RSV pathology, comes from mouse and cotton rat infection models. But these animal models are imperfect at best and are unlikely to accurately reflect disease progression in children. The continuing debate about whether RSV replication drives disease after respiratory symptoms are apparent may be discouraging the development of new antiviral compounds for RSV. Antivirals capable of shutting down virus replication are more likely to be effective later in the disease course than agents designed to block virus entry and spread, and it is through clinical testing of replication inhibitors that the drivers of RSV disease may be elucidated. Furthermore, agents npg",
