The first outbreak was recognized in late February 2003 in Hanoi, Vietnam, and was believed to have originated in November 2002 in the Guangdong province of China with several hundred cases of severe atypical pneumonia (2, 8, 18, 26) . Following the detection of similar cases in Hong Kong and Canada, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert for the illness and later designated it SARS (12, 17, 22) . The disease has since affected 30 countries on five continents, with more than 8,400 cases and more than 900 deaths. The identification of the virus and subsequent unraveling of the SARS coronavirus (CoV) genome sequence are important from a public health perspective. The SARS-CoV genome is about 29 kb in size and comprises 11 open reading frames. It contains a well-conserved region encoding an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with two open reading frames, a variable region encoding four viral structural proteins (spike [S] protein, envelope [E] protein, membrane [M] protein, and nucleocapsid [N] protein), and five putative genes encoding uncharacterized proteins (15, 18) . Its gene order is similar to that of the other known coronaviruses; however, phylogenetic analyses and sequence comparisons indicate that this virus does not closely resemble any of the previously characterized coronaviruses.",

Such information is important not only to understand the virulence of the virus and its pathogenesis but also to identify potential implications for the transmission and control of SARS. The existing reports about nonpneumonic and subclinical SARS coronavirus infections are conflicting. On one hand, Chan et al. and Chow et al. reported that no subclinical infection was found among health care workers (HCWs) (3, 4) . On the other hand, Woo and colleagues suggested in their report that nonpneumonic SARS-CoV infections are more common than SARS pneumonia (24) .

When the N\u0408 protein was used as the coating antigen, 38 out of the 175 serum samples showed titers higher than 100, ranging from 100 to 3,200. On the contrary, when the SARS-CoV N\u232c 121 protein was used, only 11 out of 175 samples showed titers between 100 and 260. Further analysis of all of these positive samples by Western blotting also confirmed the reactivities (data not shown), indicating that the positive reaction by ELISA was not due to the potential interaction between residual E. coli antigens and naturally occurring antibodies against E. coli in human sera. We chose seven serum samples which showed high titers by the N\u0408 protein-based ELISA but were negative by the N\u232c 121 protein-based ELISA and confirmed their reactivities by Western blot assay. As shown in Fig. 3 , these seven samples were positive by the N\u0408 protein-based Western blot assay but negative by the N\u232c 121 protein-based Western blot assay. This indicates 3 .

Purified recombinant N\u0408 and N\u232c 121 proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane separately. The membranes were cut into strips and incubated with diluted serum (1:100 dilution) from seven healthy volunteers (I, II, III, IV, V, VI, and VII), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG (1:1,000 dilution), and detected by DAB staining.

Among those 36 IgG-positive patients, anti-N\u232c 121 protein IgG seroconversion rates were 22.2%, 69.4%, and 100% within 7 days, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks after the onset of fever, respectively. One patient did not have detectable IgG antibodies to the N\u232c 121 protein. This patient's serum samples were collected only up to day 14 after the onset of disease; hence, a late seroconversion to SARS-CoV positivity might be the explanation for the lack of reaction. We also tested these patients' serum samples with the recombinant N\u0408 protein-based ELISA and found that the reaction range and titers showed no difference from those obtained by the N\u232c 121 protein-based ELISA (data not shown).",

            "text": "There are several reports on the use of recombinant SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein for the serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV clinical infection, indicating that SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein is highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed during infection and is therefore useful for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection (5, 7, 20) . Since the N proteins of known coronaviruses are relatively conserved, it is important to ascertain whether SARS-CoV N protein is cross-reactive with other coronaviruses and especially with antisera of other human coronaviruses. Sun and Meng reported that the N protein of SARS-CoV reacted strongly with polyclonal antisera of known antigenic group I coronaviruses, indicating that the SARS-CoV N protein shares a common antigenic epitope(s) with (24) . In a recent report, Woo et al. found that 3 out of 21 and 1 out of 7 convalescent-phase serum samples from persons infected with human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43 and HCoV-229E, respectively, tested positive by recombinant SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA, suggesting that there is cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV N protein and HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E N proteins (25) . It has been reported that antibodies against human 229E-and OC43like coronaviruses are widespread within the human population (1, 16) . Our recombinant SARS-CoV N\u0408 protein-based ELISA revealed that 38 out of 175 serum samples from healthy volunteers collected before the SARS outbreak had titers higher than 100, ranging from 100 to 3,200. Taken together, these facts indicate that the reactivity we observed for the healthy volunteer sera presented in this study was probably due to cross-reactivity with existing antibodies to other circulating coronaviruses. This clearly indicates that care should be taken while interpreting assay results when the full-length recombinant N protein of SARS-CoV, whole-virus antigen extracts, or virus-infected cells are used as reagents for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infections in humans and animal species. The predicted N protein of SARS-CoV is a highly charged basic protein of 422 amino acids with seven successive hydrophobic residues near the middle of the protein. Although the overall amino acid sequence homology of the SARS-CoV N protein to other human coronaviruses is very low (32.7% between SARS-CoV and human coronavirus OC43 and 21.3% between SARS-CoV and human coronavirus 229E), a highly conserved motif (FYYLGTGP) occurs in the N-terminal half of all coronavirus N proteins, and other conserved residues are reported to occur near this highly conserved motif (18) . Using synthetic peptides, Wang et al. found that the most immunoreactive epitopic site in the SARS coronavirus N protein is located at its COOH terminus (23) . In theory, these findings made it possible to remove the N terminus of the SARS-CoV N protein, which contains the conserved motif of all coronavirus N proteins, to reduce cross-reactivity in SARS diagnosis. We expressed a truncated SARS-CoV N\u232c 121 protein, in which the highly conserved motif (FYYLGTGP) was deleted. When this N\u232c 121 protein was used as the coating antigen for our ELISA, 11 out of 175 samples showed weak reactions, with titers ranging from 100 to 260, much fewer positive samples with titers much lower than those observed when the N\u0408 protein was used. This was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3) . Our results further supported the fact that the SARS-CoV N protein shows cross-reactivity with those of other coronaviruses and that such cross-reaction is caused by the conserved motif present within the N terminus of the protein. The fact that 11 samples also showed, although with low titers, reactivity against the SARS-CoV N\u232c 121 protein suggests that some minor common motifs might still exist within the truncated N\u232c 121 protein. Finally, to solve cross-reactivity problems, 300 was set as the cutoff titer, and all of these weak reactions were interpreted as negative in our ELISA system.",

Thirty-six patients (97.3%) showed IgG seroconversion, and the serum titers ranged from 600 to 204,800. Among these 36 positive cases, the anti-N\u232c 121 protein IgG seroconversion rates after the onset of illness were 22.2% by the first week, 69.4% by the second week, and 100% by the third week. The recombinant N\u232c 121 protein-based ELISA was more sensitive and could detect seroconversion earlier than the virus-infected cell lysate-based ELISA system (Table 1) . Our newly developed SARS-CoV N\u232c 121 proteinbased IgG ELISA is a safe, specific, and sensitive test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection. Therefore, it may be useful for clinical diagnosis and large-scale seroepidemiological studies.",

This proved that all four symptom-free HCWs truly had subclinical SARS-CoV infections. The comparison of rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV infections among HCWs in Vietnam revealed that symptomatic infection was more common than subclinical infection (Table 2) .

            "text": "Vietnam was the first country in which SARS was acknowledged. At the beginning of the outbreak, the severity of the disease was not recognized; hence, no effective prevention measures were taken. Therefore, within 2 weeks, extensive nosocomial transmission occurred among the hospital staff at the French Hospital. Contact-tracing data revealed that all of the four symptom-free HCWs from this study who had antibodies against SARS-CoV were in direct contact with the index case; however, they did not develop SARS but experienced only subclinical infection, as proven by seroconversion. There have been several reports dealing with subclinical or atypical forms of SARS. Lee et al. reported a case of possible asymptomatic SARS-CoV infection in Hong Kong (11) . Li et al. reported that, among 125 people exposed to SARS patients, 20 developed SARS and 2 had nonpneumonic infections (13) . In addition, Ho et al. reported that 8 out of 372 HCWs in a teaching hospital in Singapore were positive for SARS-CoV antibody. Among them, six were probable or suspected SARS cases; however, two had only fever, indicating that a small number of mildly symptomatic individuals existed, although no asymptomatic individuals were found (6). Chow et al. reported that with a dot blot ELISA combined with a virus neutralization test of 87 HCW serum samples, no subclinical SARS was found (4). In addition, Chan et al., using an indirect immunofluorescence assay, examined 674 HCWs from a hospital in which a SARS outbreak had occurred, and none of the HCWs had antibodies to SARS-CoV (3). In a later report, Ip et al. found that 3 out of 131 HCWs who worked in SARS medical wards had subclinical infections (8) . All of these studies used inactivated virus-infected cell extract-based ELISA or virusinfected cell-based immunofluorescence assays for diagnosis; however, as shown in our study, the inactivated virus-infected cell extract-based ELISA detected SARS antibodies with low sensitivity. Besides, with these methods, the possibility of crossreaction with other human coronaviruses exists. On the con-trary, our detection system, which consists of a truncated N protein-based ELISA for the screening of symptom-free HCWs and confirmation by a virus neutralization test, is more sensitive and more specific, giving much more reliable results to elucidate subclinical SARS-CoV infection.",
