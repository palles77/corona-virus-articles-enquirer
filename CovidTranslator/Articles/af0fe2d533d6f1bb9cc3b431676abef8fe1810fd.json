In this report, we describe the first application of AMP in the field of nanobiosensors. In 2 O 3 nanowire based biosensors have been configured with an AMP (Fibronectin, Fn) to detect nucleocapsid (N) protein, a biomarker for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Using these devices, N protein was detected at sub-nanomolar concentration in the presence of 44 \u00b5M bovine serum albumin as a background. Furthermore, the binding constant of the AMP to Fn was determined from the concentration dependence of the response of our biosensors.",

            "text": "In less than a decade, biosensors based on nanowire/carbon nanotube transistors have successfully made the transition from proof of concept 1 to highly selective, ultra sensitive devices capable of detecting specific proteins and DNA sequences. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] These devices utilize a capture agent on the sensor surface to selectively bind the target biomolecules. The captured biomolecules affect the electronic properties of the nanowires/nanotubes, resulting in an electronically readable signal. Capture agents commonly used in nanobiosensors include antibodies, oligonucleotides, and small ligands (e.g. biotin). [1] [2] [3] [4] 8 Antibody mimic proteins (AMPs) are a class of affinity binding agents developed by in vitro selection techniques. 9, 10 These AMPs can be evolved/engineered to improve recognition properties such as selectivity and binding affinity, with the potential to surpass antibodies and nucleotide aptamers. In contrast to typical antibodies, AMPs are stable to a wide range of pH and electrolyte concentrations, and are relatively small (usually 2-5 nm, less than 10 kDa). Moreover, it is expected that these peptide based affinity agents can be produced in large quantity, at relatively low cost. The combination of low cost, high binding affinity, chemical stability, and small size makes AMPs particularly attractive for use with nanowire/nanotube biosensors.",

These AMPs will allow us to build nanobiosensors for virtually any biomolecule with high sensitivity/selectivity, as demonstrated here for a protein related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), using devices based on In 2 O 3 nanowires. Metal oxide nanowires, such as In 2 O 3 , ZnO, and SnO 2 , can be easily derivatized and their surface do not possess an insulating, native oxide layer (e.g. SiO 2 on Si nanowires) that may decrease the nanowire sensitivity. 8 Thus, it is worthwhile to investigate metal oxide nanowires as alternative nanomaterials to silicon nanowires for biosensing applications. We demonstrate that our technology platform, entailing In 2 O 3 nanowire FETs combined with AMPs, can be used as a diagnostic tool with the potential to serve as a cost-effective, rapid, portable system. A fibronectin-based protein (Fn) was employed as an example of AMP capture agent to selectively recognize and bind the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The N protein is a biomarker associated with the SARS coronavirus. 11 Our platform is capable of specifically detecting the N protein at sub-nanomolar concentrations, in the presence of 44 \u00b5M bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a background. This sensitivity, while comparable to current immunological detection methods, can be obtained in a relatively short time and without the aid of any signal amplifier, such as fluorescence labeled reagents. Ultimately, we show that our platform can also be used to accurately determine the dissociation constant of the N protein and Fn by applying a conventional Langumir model to the concentration-dependent sensing response.",

This unique thiol group allows the Fn anchoring to the nanowire to be carried out selectively, since the chosen linker molecule/chemistry (i.e. maleimide groups) gives a nanowire surface that is reactive only toward sulphydryl groups (see method and supporting information for details). This conjugation strategy allows every bound Fn to retain full activity, a clear advantage over antibodies, which are often bound to the nanowire surface via amine containing residues, randomly distribute on the antibody surface. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Moreover, our Fn can also be easily configured with other functional groups, such as azides 13, 14 or cyclopentadienes, 15 that are useful in bioconjugation.",

Briefly, In 2 O 3 nanowires were grown via a laser ablation CVD method on a Si/SiO 2 substrate, following a well established procedure in our laboratory. [16] [17] [18] [19] The nanowires were suspended in isopropanol and deposited onto another Si/SiO 2 substrate. The position of the source and drain (S-D) electrodes was defined by photolithography, with channel length and width of 2.5 \u00b5m and 780 \u00b5m, respectively. Metal deposition on the prepatterned surface followed by lift-off completed the device fabrication. Immediately after cleaning, the nanowire devices were submerged in a 0.1 mM aqueous solution of 6phosphonohexanoic acid followed by baking under inert atmosphere, resulting in the binding of the phosphonic acid to the surface of the In 2 O 3 NWs. The S-D contacts were then wired to a custom-made printed circuit board and a mixing cell was assembled on the device chip (supporting information, Figure S3 ). This mixing cell was used to deliver and handle all the chemical reagents necessary to complete the surface modification and all the buffer solutions during active measurements.",

Our In 2 O 3 NW FET devices exhibit excellent transistor behavior in 0.01x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. The linear behavior of the source/drain current versus source/drain voltage (I ds -V ds ) curves at V ds , \u2264 0.08 V (Figure 1b) suggests good contact between the nanowires and source/drain electrodes. Strong gate dependence was also observed for a typical device, as shown by the I ds versus liquid gate voltage (I ds -V g ) curves shown in linear (red curve) and logarithmic scale (blue) in Figure 1c . The on/off ratio and transconductance were ~4.6 \u00d7 10 3 and ~3.6 \u00b5S, respectively. These results confirm the stability of our devices under active measurement conditions. Further surface modification of the nanowires conferred our devices with the desired biological recognition properties. The carboxylic acid functional groups on the NW surface were activated with EDC and the activated COOHs were allowed to react with BMPH, resulting in the formation of a NW surface reactive toward the unique thiol present on the Fibronectin probe molecule. The functionalized devices were stored submerged in 1\u00d7 PBS at 4 \u00b0C.",

            "text": "The normalized electrical response of an Fn-modified nanowire device is shown in Figure 2a c, where we have plotted I ds divided by the I ds at t = 0 s, referred to as I/I 0 . The device was operated at V ds = \u2212200 mV and V g = \u2212100 mV. Under such experimental conditions, a baseline signal was quickly established in pure 0.01\u00d7 PBS buffer, as indicated in Figure 2a . We note that the leakage current between source and drain through the buffer is negligible compared to the conduction through nanowires. (see supporting information.) A shift in the baseline level is often observed when transitioning from pure buffer to protein-rich buffer, attributed to nonspecific binding interactions of proteins with the nanowire device. These non-specific binding phenomena, if not adequately mitigated, may lead to false positive results. Passivating regions of the device that are subject to non-specific binding with a \"blocking agent\" (typically BSA or Tween 20), as traditionally used in bioanalytical assays such as ELISA, 21, 22 is technique useful to minimize false positives during active measurements. We have employed BSA as \"blocking agent\" for our nanowire devices including the source-drain electrodes. Aliquots of a 10 mg/mL solution of BSA were used to increase the protein concentration of the buffer in contact with the nanowires. After each BSA addition, the baseline re-equilibrated to a lower value of S-D current, as shown in Figure 2a and 2b. Saturation of non-specific binding sites was achieved at 40\u00b5M concentration of BSA, as indicated in Figure 2b . We note that BSA passivation is widely employed in many standard detection techniques such as ELISA; however, it may be possible that the BSA passivation step can be eliminated by increasing the surface coverage of Fn. The baseline stability in a protein-rich medium was then tested by increasing the BSA concentration by 10% (4 \u00b5M) (shown with a black arrow in Figure 2c ). The device showed no significant response, which confirmed that sites for non-specific binding were blocked. The conductance of the device rapidly decreased (4%) upon exposure the nanowire sensor to a solution containing 0.6 nM of N protein in 44 \u00b5M BSA. We further tested the response of our devices to higher N-protein concentrations. N-protein solutions were prepared by successive additions of small aliquots of a 100\u00b130 nM stock solution of N-protein in 0.01\u00d7 PBS containing 44 \u00b5M BSA. When the N protein concentration was progressively increased to 2 nM, 5 nM, and 10 nM, we observed a consistent decrease in device conductance of 12%, 22%, and 31%, respectively, relative to the baseline. The pI of In 2 O 3 is ~8, 23 and the pI of N protein is ~10, 24 while the PBS buffer we used had pH = 7.4. The pI of the N protein indicates that our target analyte possesses a net positive charge under our measurement conditions. However, some regions of N proteins are locally negatively charged, such as the C-terminus of N protein, which is rich in serine groups (pI ~ 5). 25 The pI of In 2 O 3 indicates that the surface of our In 2 O 3 nanowires is positively charged. Thus, it might be possible that the positive charges on In 2 O 3 nanowires attract the negatively charged regions of N protein captured on the nanowire surface. These serine residues could induce a chemical gating effect on the nanowires, causing a decrease in the conductance of our device. Other non-negligible contributions to the sensing mechanism could come from an increase of the carrier scattering due to the binding of N protein. We note that the sensing mechanism for nanobiosensors is still a topic of intense debate in the literature [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] and it is currently under intensive investigations in our research group.",

Sensors based on In 2 O 3 nanowires were modified with a fibronectin-based binding agent that can selectively detect the SARS biomarker N protein. The N protein was detected at a sensitivity comparable to current immunological detection methods (subnanomolar concentration), but obtained within shorter time and without the aid of labeled reagents. We believe that nanowire biosensor devices functionalized with engineered proteins (evolved to possess elevated affinity toward target molecules) can have important potential applications ranging from disease diagnosis to homeland security. This report also demonstrates the potential for nanobiosensors to be used as an accurate, convenient, and rapid tool to measure the dissociation constants for biological complex systems, such as antibodyantigen, protein-ligand, oligonucleotides, etc..",

A veil of this diluted Au nanoparticle solution was allowed to dry on a Si/SiO 2 surface (typical size: 1-2 cm 2 ), resulting in a uniform surface coating of Au nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were then employed as a catalyst for the laser ablation promoted growth of indium oxide nanowires, using InAs as a source of In. Details of the nanowire growth are described elsewhere. 16, 18, 19 The as-grown nanowires were suspended in isopropanol by sonication and this suspension was deposited onto another Si/SiO 2 substrate (typically on a 3\" Si wafer with a surface coverage of 1 nanowire per 100 \u00b5m 2 ). The position of the source and drain (S-D) electrodes was defined by photolithography. The S-D electrodes were designed to have an interdigitated interface at the semiconductor channel, leading to FETs with channel length and width of 2.5 \u00b5m and 780 \u00b5m, respectively.

These devices were baked at 125 \u00b0C under nitrogen for 2 hr. These devices were then wired on a custom-made printed circuit board and a mixing cell was assembled on the device chip ( Figure S3 ). This mixing cell was used to deliver and handle all the chemical reagents necessary for surface modification and all the buffer solutions during active measurements. The carboxylic acid functional groups on the NW surface were activated by placing in the mixing cell a 50 mM solution of EDC in MES buffer and allowed the activated COOHs to react with BMPH (present in the same solution at 5 mM concentration) for 60-90 minutes (ii). Unreacted, EDC-activated carboxyl groups were quenched with a 50 mM solution of ethanolamine (ii).

The inset on the right side is the configuration of our device during active sensing measurements. BSA protein was used to block sites for non-specific binding.
