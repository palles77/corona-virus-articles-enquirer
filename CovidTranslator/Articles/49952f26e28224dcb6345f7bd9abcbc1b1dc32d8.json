Here, we report results from our surveillance of astroviruses in human and rodent faecal samples in Hong Kong. Classical human astroviruses (n59) and a human MLB1 astrovirus were detected in human faecal samples (n5622). Novel astroviruses were detected from 1.6 % of the faecal samples of urban brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) (n5441), indicating the prevalence of astrovirus infection in rats might be much lower than that recently observed in bats. These rat astroviruses were phylogenetically related to recently discovered human astroviruses MLB1 and MLB2, suggesting that the MLB viruses and these novel rat astroviruses may share a common ancestor.",

The members of the family are classified into mamastroviruses and avastroviruses and are known to infect mammalian and avian species, respectively (Mendez & Arias, 2007) . In human, the classical human astroviruses are genetically closely related and can be classified into eight serotypes (HAstV1-8). In addition, several genetically distinct human astroviruses (e.g. MLB1) have been recently identified in stool samples from patients suffering from gastroenteritis (Finkbeiner et al., 2008a (Finkbeiner et al., , 2009a Kapoor et al., 2009) . Although astrovirus is one of the major causative agents for gastroenteritis, there is relatively little information on the ecology and evolution of these viruses. The recent discoveries of genetically diverse astroviruses in bats (Chu et al., 2008b; Zhu et al., 2009) and other animals (Atkins et al., 2009; Rivera et al., 2010) highlight the genetic diversity of astroviruses in nature and suggest that there might be many more novel astroviruses circulating in peridomestic and wild animals.",

Between the two representative RAstVs, sequence identities of ORF1a (partial), ORF1b and ORF2 regions were 79.4, 91.6 and 70.9 %, respectively (Table 1) . These representative rat viruses are phylogenetically distinct from each other and have a sister-clade relationship, which is supported by high posterior probability values in all ORFs (Fig. 1a) . Sequence analysis of these and other astroviruses by using Recombination Detection Program 2 (Martin et al., 2005) and Simplot (Lole et al., 1999) did not reveal strong evidence of recombination events in the rat viral genomes. Overall, our results suggested that these are two groups of astroviruses circulating in R. norvegicus in Hong Kong.",

Complete ORF1b nucleotide sequences of selected mamastroviruses were aligned at the amino acid level. Dating analysis was done using the uncorrelated relaxed clock model, with rates at each branch being allowed to vary independently from a lognormal distribution. Markov chain Monte Carlo sample chains were run for 60 000 000 generations with sampling every 3000 generations under GTR nucleotide substitution model and allowing gamma-rate heterogeneity for all datasets. As indicated in Fig. 1(b) , RAstVs and MLB viruses formed a unique clade which is supported by a posterior probability of 0.992. This strongly indicated that RAstVs and MLB viruses might share a common ancestor virus. The mean date of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) virus was estimated to be AD 1054 (95 % highest posterior densities: AD 837-1827). In addition, the aligned ORF1b sequences were subjected to a d N /d S analysis by GA-Branch method incorporated in Datamonkey (http://www. datamonkey.org/) (Pond & Frost, 2005) . This analysis failed to find an accelerated positive selection for the RAstVs or for the MLB viruses (not shown), suggesting that these RAstVs and MLB viruses have been circulating in and adapted to rats and humans, respectively, over a long period of time.",

Our results suggest that the human MLB viruses and the rat astroviruses shared a common ancestor. However, with the limited sequencing data available at present, questions concerning the evolutionary history of these viruses cannot be answered in greater detail. Further surveillance in rodent species might help to improve the preciseness of the MRCA dating and better explain the origins of the rat astroviruses and MLB viruses.",

The prevalence of these novel RNA viruses in bat faecal samples was found be extremely high (10-50 %) (Chu et al., 2008a, b; Poon et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2009) . By contrast, less than 2 % of the studied rodent faecal samples were found to be positive for astrovirus. We also screened about 60 % of these rodent samples (n5403) for coronavirus, but none of them was positive in the assay (data not shown). These findings suggest that bats are unusual in their propensity to harbour astroviruses and coronaviruses and may have a more prominent role in shaping the evolution of these groups of viruses. However, as rats are more likely to have close and repeated contact to human populations, further systematic surveillance of novel viruses in rodent populations in different geographical locations should be encouraged.",

Representative rat astroviruses (RS118 and RS126) and astrovirus MLB1 HK05 are in bold. Alignments of amino acid sequences were done by using CLUSTAL W with default parameters and edited manually for accuracy. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with maximumlikelihood method by PHYML. The reliability of nodes in the trees was estimated by the approximate likelihood ratio test method. Bars show the estimated genetic distance of these viruses. (b) Phylogenetic trees for ORF1b nucleotide sequences with dating estimated by BEAST. Mean date (in years) and the estimated posterior probabilities of nodes are shown. Ninety-five per cent highest posterior density regions of node dating are indicated by node bars. GenBank accession numbers of the reference sequences are indicated.",
