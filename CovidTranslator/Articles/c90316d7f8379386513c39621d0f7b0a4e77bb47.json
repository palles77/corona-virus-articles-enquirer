Many agents of synthetic and natural origin have stimulatory, suppressive or regulatory activity. There is growing evidence that drugs or biological agents capable of modulating single pathways or targets are of limited value as immune-related therapies. Systems biology approaches are now gaining more interest compared with monovalent approaches, which can be of limited benefits with complications. This has stimulated interest in the use of 'cocktails' of immunodrugs to restore immunostasis. Botanicals are chemically complex and diverse and could therefore provide appropriate combinations of synergistic moieties useful in drug discovery. Here, the importance of traditional medicine in natural product drug discovery related to immunodrugs is reviewed.",

The selectivity and flexibility that is necessary to regulate cell traffic under homeostatic and diseased conditions is provided by the differential distribution and regulated expression of cytokines and their receptors. As a consequence, cytokines are responsible for the development of phenotypes and are, therefore, logical targets for therapeutic immune modulation [1] . Immunodrugs include synthetic organics, biologicals, such as cytokines and antibodies, and microbial and botanical natural products, which influence immunoregulatory cascades to bring about their specific stimulatory, suppressive or regulatory effect. Immune suppression has been widely studied for clinical applications [2] . Historically, botanicals have been a mainstay of drug treatments and are currently receiving attention as sources of synergistic combinations. Here, recent developments in botanical immunodrug discovery are reviewed.",

The most widely studied approaches consist of whole-cell vaccines, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy and peptide vaccines. Many clinical studies have demonstrated safety but not necessarily the efficacy of such strategies [3] . Moreover, there is emerging consensus that the most efficacious therapy should activate several components of the immune system [4] . Cytokine therapy in cancer is another attractive approach; however, balancing optimal doses to avoid toxic reactions remains challenging [5] . Several cytotoxic drugs have immunomodulatory effects at relatively low doses and can exert immunity-dependent curative effects in animal models of cancer. Combination therapies involving low-dose anticancer agents and cytokines have demonstrated some benefits. For example, combinations of appropriate regimens of doxorubicin plus interleukin (IL)-2 or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) could be curative and produced a life-long immunological memory in an EL4 lymphoma C57BL/6 mouse model. Many researchers have demonstrated that the induction of T-helper (Th) 1-promoting cytokines, using specific adjuvants, can enhance antitumour immunity and can prevent or reduce tumour growth. These trends substantiate the possibility of establishing combination regimens based on low-dose anticancer drugs, specific cytokines and immunological adjuvants [6] .",

Pegylated interferon is a recently developed pharmaceutical preparation that has proven beneficial in non-responsive patients, particularly in those with cirrhosis or hepatitis C virus genotype 1 [11] . Other cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-2 and IL-17, have shown potential in augmenting immune responses in various infectious conditions and malignancies. The therapeutic effect of cytokine blockers is also reported in septic shock [12] . A recent study on hepatitis C has shown that interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), in combination with ribavirin, induces a higher percentage of lymphocyte activation [13] than for IFN-\u03b3 alone.

Currently, much of the literature supports the view that Th1-Th2 is essential to immunostasis and many of the T-cell-directed therapies have provided modest clinical benefits [32] . Although this view of signal conversion looks relatively simplistic, mediators of signal transduction do not interact in a linear www.drugdiscoverytoday.com manner but within a biochemical matrix. As a consequence, each cytokine has multiple functions and their modulation would be expected to result in diverse therapeutic functions. Such complex crosstalk between signalling networks imposes challenges for the discovery of optimal therapeutic interventions [33] . In cancer, researchers have arrived at a consensus that reconstitution of function is important, rather than reconstitution of cells or cytokines, and the most efficacious therapy will be one in which multiple responses of the immune system are activated. Trends indicate that future immunotherapy should involve cocktails of drugs that concurrently and/or simultaneously address vital components of the immune matrix [34] . This will require synergistic combinations for homeostatic regulation of the immune system. Historically, botanicals have facilitated and enriched the drug discovery process and, we propose, should be explored as sources for synergistic combinations.",

Traditional methods, for example, Chinese medicine, Japanese Kampo and Indian Ayurveda, are becoming important bioprospecting tools [39] . Ayurveda gives a separate class of immunomodulatory botanicals named Rasayanas. Several botanicals from these texts have been studied for their immunomodulatory properties and have the potential to provide new scaffolds for safer, synergistic, cocktail immunodrugs [40] .

It is prominent in Ayurveda as Rasayana with cytoprotective and demulcent effects and is a popular home remedy for minor throat infections. Biologically active substances in liquorice roots include glycyrrhizic acid (GL; Figure 1 ) and its aglycone (GA), phenolic compounds, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, lipids, sterine, and so on. Recently, GL and GA were shown to exert a hepatoprotective effect via modulation of immune-mediated hepatocyte toxicity, NF-\u03baB and IL-10, which explains how their administration resulted in a downregulation of inflammation in the liver [41] . GL has been reported to increase the resistance to Candida albicans and herpes simplex virus-1 infection in animal models [42, 43] . Many researchers have suggested that effects on the production of IFN and Th2 cytokines might be one of the mechanisms involved in the antiinfective process. Recently, glycyrrhizin was found to be active in inhibiting replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated virus (FFM-1 and FFM-2). In the study, GA was found more effective compared with ribavirin, 6-azauridine, pyrazofurin or mycophenolic acid [44] . GL is also reported to have modulatory effects on the complement system. Reports indicate that GL blocks C5 or a more distal stage of the complement cascade, suggesting that it might have a role in preventing tissue injury not only in chronic hepatitis but also in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases [45] .",

This complements emerging systems biology approaches, which holistically monitor operating biological processes as an integrated system. It is likely that multiple immune-modulating strategies will be necessary to achieve clinical success owing to complex interplay between pathways. We need designer drugs, which involve safer, curative and synergistic combinations. Bioprospecting will have a major role in identifying such combinations. The botanical immunodrugs discussed here have such potential because they offer additional therapeutic benefits to address associated conditions such as infection, inflammation and cancer. Botanical extracts provide cytoprotective, anticancer, anti-inflammatory and anti-infective activities in addition to immunoregulatory activity. For example, crude extract of TC has immunostimulant, anticancer and cytoprotective activities, where cytoprotective activities are attributed to polysaccharides and immunostimulant activity is attributed to diterpenoids [76] . Recently, researchers observed antimicrobial activity coupled with immune modulation [80] . Bryostatins isolated from the marine organism Bugula neritina have antineoplastic activity along with mimicking the effect of recombinant human GM-CSF [81] . Three polysaccharides (krestin, lentinan and scihzophyllum) developed by Japanese scientists from mushrooms are in clinical use as adjuvants in chemotherapy. These polysaccharides have now been developed into multipurpose medicines with cytostatic, anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic activities [82] . Similarly, polysaccharides and oxygenated triterpenoids derived from Ganoderma lucidum (a fungus from traditional Chinese medicine) showed broad spectrum pharmacological functions [83] . These examples underline the importance of bioprospecting for newer synergistic combinations and pharmacological agents.

Traditional knowledge, particularly from the great traditions of, for example, Ayurveda and China, will have an important role in bioprospecting. Rasayanas are a selected class of botanicals from Ayurveda with putative capabilities to rejuvenate, promote longevity and health (Box 2).
