Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for this phenomenon. [5] [6] [7] The first of these is molecular mimicry, a phenomenon in which T-cell epitopes from a pathogen are sufficiently similar to a host peptide to induce a misdirected T-cell response. Another possibility is the release of previously hidden selfepitopes to which T cells have not been tolerized, called epitope spreading. Alternatively, the cytokine milieu in the setting of infection might activate and induce the proliferation of nearby autoreactive T cells. Finally, T cells activated specifically against an unrelated infectious agent may migrate into areas of chronic inflammation. These cells could then interact with resident cells and soluble mediators at the site of inflammation to induce bystander pathology.",

We used the macrophage/microglia marker F4/80 to identify the location and number of these cells in the white matter of chimeras with IFN-\u2425-sufficient or -deficient T cells. Consistent with previous studies of JHM-induced demyelination, 20,25,26 IFN-\u2425-sufficient chimeras had infiltration of macrophages/microglia into the white matter in areas of demyelination (Figure 1, A and  B) . IFN-\u2425-deficient chimeras, however, had limited macrophage/microglia infiltration into the spinal cord. These areas may represent sites of incipient myelin destruction, although little frank demyelination was detected ( Figure  1 , E and F). Demyelination occurred in the vicinity of virus-infected cells. However, virus antigen was not found in areas of demyelination, suggesting that myelin destruction occurred during the process of virus clearance. (Figure 1, C and G) .",

There was a similar frequency and number of activated cells in both IFN-\u2425-sufficient and -deficient chimeras as measured by TNF-\u2423 staining (Figure 2 , B and F; Table 1 ). Therefore, we conclude that the production of IFN-\u2425 by specifically activated cells, and not merely activation of T cells, is responsible for bystander demyelination in this system. Additionally, there were no CD8 T cells specific for the immunodominant epitope of JHM (residues 510 -518 of the spike glycoprotein) in any mice tested ( Figure  2, C, D, G, H) . A recent study 28 demonstrated that, even in the absence of cognate antigen in the CNS, activated CD8 T cells could infiltrate the CNS, with subsequent activation of microglia. We were able to detect activated P14 T cells in the CNS of CFA:gp33-treated mice, in the absence of JHM infection, although there were roughly six-fold fewer T cells in the CNS of uninfected mice than in their JHM-infected counterparts (data not shown).

These results highlight the important role that CD8 T cells have in demyelination in JHM-infected mice. IFN-\u2425 has also been shown to be critical in other models of demyelination and in MS. In rodents with EAE induced by CD8 T cells specific for a CNS antigen, demyelination is greatly diminished in the absence of IFN-\u2425. 30 In all cases, the presence of CD8 T-cell-produced IFN-\u2425 results in increased macrophage/microglia infiltration into the white matter, with subsequent demyelination. Similarly, CD8 T cells are abundant in MS lesions 31 and treatment with anti-IFN-\u2425 antibody appeared to reduce disability in a small (n \u03ed 15 patients receiving treatment) clinical trial. 32 Consistent with these data, administration of IFN-\u2425 to patients with MS resulted in disease exacerbation. 33 In patients with MS, the source of the IFN-\u2425 that leads to disease exacerbation is unknown, but based on our results, it may be from CD8 T cells responding to an intercurrent infection. From our results, it appears that IFN-\u2425 and not any other cytokine or chemokine was the key mediator of bystander demyelination (Figure 3 ). However, because our screen for chemokines and cytokines was not exhaustive, it is possible that other soluble factors were affected by the presence or absence of CD8 T-lymphocyte-produced IFN-\u2425. Alternatively, differences in local concentration of chemokines or cytokines may be critical in the demyelinating process and might not be evident in this assay. It is also possible that IFN-\u2425 affects We also measured cytokine and chemokine levels for uninfected, but CFA: gp33-treated, IFN-\u2425 \u03e9/\u03e9 (hatched bars) and IFN-\u2425 \u03ea/\u03ea (shaded bars) chimeras. *, No mRNA for this chemokine was detectable in these mice.

Serial, 8-m midsaggital sections of spinal cords from IFN-\u2425-sufficient (A to D, I, J) or -deficient (E to H) chimeras were stained for myelin (A, E, I), macrophages/microglia (B, F, J), viral antigen (C and G), or neurofilament H (D and H). Demyelination in both types of JHM-infected mice was focal, although it was uniformly more extensive in IFN-\u2425 \u03e9/\u03e9 chimeras (A) than in IFN-\u2425 \u03ea/\u03ea chimeras (E). Demyelination in IFN-\u2425 \u03e9/\u03e9 chimeras correlated with increased macrophage infiltration into the white matter (B) as compared to IFN-\u2425 \u03ea/\u03ea chimeric mice (F). In both cases, viral antigen was abundant throughout the white matter (C and G) although antigen could not be detected in areas of robust demyelination (A and C). Axons were detected traversing an edematous, demyelinated area, consistent with primary loss of myelin (D). No axonal loss was detected in IFN-\u2425 \u03ea/\u03ea chimeras, consistent with the lack of demyelination (H). In chimeras with activated T cells but no JHM infection, there was neither demyelination (I) nor macrophage/microglia activation (J). Scale bar, 50 m for A to H; 100 m for I and J. Table 1.
