Monoclonal antibodies to both the E2 and the E3 glycoproteins were found to efficiently neutralize virus in vitro. None of the monoclonal antibodies directed against the El glycoprotein neutralized virus infectivity . Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the E2 glycoprotein were all found to immunoprecipitate gpl 90, gpl 00, and their intracellular precursor protein gp170. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the E3 glycoprotein immunoprecipitated gp124 and showed differential reactivity to its precursor proteins gp59 and gpl 18 . These monoclonal antibodies also showed differential reactivity to an apparent degradation product of E3 . Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to E2 bound to two distinct nonoverlappig antigenic domains as defined by competitive binding assays . Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the E3 glycoprotein also bound to two distinct antigenic sites as defined by competitive binding assays plus a third site which overlapped these regions . Other results indicated that one domain on the E3 glycoprotein could be further subdivided into two epitopes . Thus four epitopes could be defined by E3-specific monoclonal antibodies .

The competition curves were calculated as described by Kimura-Kurado and Yasui (1983) using the formula [100(A -n)]l(A -8)] where A is the OD in the absence of competing antibody, B is the OD in the presence of homologous antibody at 1 :10 (or 1 : 100) dilution, and n is the OD in the presence of competitor at 1 :101_1 :107 dilutions . Thus, by definition, self-competition at low dilution of homologous unlabeled antibody was equal to 100% and the measurement of competition by heterologous unlabeled antibody was a relative measure . Competition at the plateau was regarded as strong (+) if greater than 70%, significant (\u00b1) if between 30 and 50% and negative (-) if less than 30% . Actual selfcompetitions were calculated using the formula [100(A -B)]/A, where A and B in this instance were corrected for nonspecific binding as measured by the binding of anti-mouse-conjugated antibody to wells incubated without unlabeled competitor antibody .",

This polypeptide was also glycosylated (data not shown) . It was suspected that the 33K polypeptide (gp33) was derived by reduction of gp64 and that the latter protein was a disulfidelinked dieter (similar to gpl24/E3) . If this were true, gp64 should be absent under reducing conditions . Since gpl 24/E3 is itself reduced to gp62/E3, the presence or absence of gp64 would normally be difficult to assess under reducing conditions due to a lack of resolution between these proteins . However, when immunoprecipitates of mAB KC4-3 (which demonstrated greater reactivity to gp64 than to gpl24/E3) were examined, an assessment could be made . Under reducing conditions gp64 was absent and apparently replaced by gp33 (compare Fig . 3B , lanes F and F') . This indicated that gp64 was a disulfide-linked dimer of probably identical gp33 subunits . Since these polypeptides have no apparent role in the genesis of gp124/E3, as observed in pulse-chase experiments (Deregt et al., in press), they were concluded to be degradation products of gp124/E3 and designated gp64/dE3 and gp33/dE3) .",

The differential reactivity of E3-specific monoclonal antibodies to the E3 degradation product, gp64, suggested that these monoclonal antibodies might also bind differentially to the E3 precursor monomer gp59-and precursor dimer gpl 18 (designated as pE3) . Thus to determine the binding ability of E3 monoclonal antibodies to these proteins, BCV-infected and mock-infected cells were pulsed with [ 35 S]methionine and chased with MEM, and lysates were prepared and used for immunoprecipitation . The results show that although all E3 monoclonal antibodies could bind to gpl 1 8/pE3 (Fig . 4A,  lanes A, C, E, G) , only mAB BD9-8C was able to immunoprecipitate the monomer gp59/pE3 (Fig . 4A, lane  A) . Monoclonal antibody KC4-3 revealed the same weak binding for gpl 18/-E3 as it did for gp124/E3 . This reaction was better observed after a 30-min pulse with [35 S]methionine (Fig . 4B, lane C) . The same results were obtained when the concentration of monoclonal antibody was increased (10-fold) or decreased (5-fold) . When SDS was excluded from the lysates of pulsed cells a minor amount of what was apparently gp59 in mABs HC10-5 and KD9-40 immunoprecipitations was detected along with apparent nonspecific binding to p53, the nucleocapsid protein . This was observed in lanes A-D when the gel shown in Fig . 4B was exposed 10 times longer (data not shown) . We could not distinguish whether this was due to a very weak reaction with gp59, nonspecific binding, or a slight amount of reduction of gp118, after immunoprecipitation, during sample preparation . Nevertheless, we considered it as a negative result . Based on their differential reactivities with gp124/E3, gp64/dE3, gp59/pE3, and gpl 18/pE3, summarized in Table 2 , the E3 monoclonal antibodies defined four epitopes on the E3 protein .",

In contrast, only one E2-specific monoclonal antibody (BB10-27) bound to antigen denatured by SDS plus 2-mercaptoethanol although a weaker reaction (than with antigen denatured with SDS alone) was observed (Fig . 5E') E3 also bound to SDS-denatured antigen (Fig . 5G ) .

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies directed against E2 defined three antigenic regions on the BCV protein . Two of these regions can induce the production of highly efficient neutralizing antibodies and their antigenic integrity was dependent upon disulfide linkages . At least six major antigenic sites on the E2 protein of MHV-JHM were identified by competitive binding assays in previous studies . Three of these sites were involved in neutralizing virus (Talbot et al., 1984 ; Wege at al., 1984) . Four major antigenic sites were found on TGEV E2 protein by CBA . Two of these sites were responsible for most of the neutralization mediating determinants and up to six neutralizing epitopes could be distinguished by various other criteria in another study (Delmas at al., 1986 ; Jimenez et at, 1986) . These studies employed, in general, a larger panel of monoclonal antibodies to the E2 protein than reported here . Thus whether more neutralizing epitopes on the BCV E2 protein sites could have been identified had a larger panel of monoclonal antibodies been used remains to be determined . Wege et al. (1984) could distinguish three classes of monoclonal antibodies by their pattern of immunoprecipitation of E2 (gp170 and gp98) and pE2 (gp150) proteins . Only monoclonal antibodies that could bind all three proteins in the immunoprecipitation assay had high neutralizing titers . Similarly, all neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the BCV E2 protein reported here immunoprecipitated the analogous proteins gpl90/ E2, gpl OO/E2, and gpl70/pE2 . Three antigenic domains designated A, B, and C representing four distinct epitopes could be defined on the E3 protein by the present panel of E3-specific monoclonal antibodies . Differential reactivity of E3 monoclonal antibodies to gpl 24/E3 and gp64/dE3, in radioimmunoprecipitation assays (RIPA), distinguished three epitopes : epitope Al and epitope B (defined by mABs HC10-5 and KC4-3, respectively) from each other and from the epitopes A2 and C (defined by mABs KD9-40 and BD9-8C, respectively) . The differential avidity of mAB KC4-3 for gpl24/E3 and gp64/ dE3 in this assay was considered significant and suggested that an apparent change in epitope conformation occurs when gp124/E3 is proteolytically cleaved to gp64/dE3, one which allows better binding of KC4-3 under the conditions of the assay . Assay conditions were likely important for mAB KC4-3 binding since although KC4-3 bound poorly to gp124/E3 in RIPA, it BD9-8C C appeared to bind as well as other monoclonal antibodies to E3 in antibody binding assays . Two patterns of reactivity to gp59/pE3 and gpl 18/ pE3 were observed by E3 monoclonal antibodies . These patterns distinguished epitope C defined by mAB BD9-8C from epitope A2 defined by mAB KD9-40 (and from epitopes A and B) because only mAB BD9-8C bound the precursor monomer gp59 .",

Alternatively, this may indicate slight avidity differences between the E3 monoclonal antibodies . All E3 epitopes were, however, apparently destroyed when SIDS and 2-mercaptoethanol were used, suggesting that disulfide linkages are essential for their antigenicity . E3 occurs as gp62 (monomer) under reducing conditions, thus the loss of antigenicity under these conditions would be expected for epitopes Al, A2, and B, as the defining monoclonal antibodies do not bind the precursor monomer gp59 in radioimmunoprecipitation assays . Conversely, since mAB BD9-8C (epitope C) can bind the monomer gp59/pE3 it might have been expected to react with gp62/E3 in Western immunoblots . However, since this monoclonal antibody did not react with gp62/E3 and since intermolecular disulfide bonds are apparently not required for this epitope's antigenicity (as indicated by the reactivity of mAB BD9-8C for gp59/pE3) this suggests that an intramolecular disulfide bond may be involved in preservation of this epitope's conformation .",
