Herein, we report 36 cases of patients with measles requiring ICU admission.",

Our findings are in agreement with previous reports since 23 patients (69.7%) with measles pneumonitis presented with radiographic abnormalities consistent with interstitial lesions. It should be noted that data regarding radiographic assessment of measles pneumonitis are predominantly based on chest X-ray examination, coming either from settings in which CT scans are not readily available or from studies dating from the pre-CT scan era. 26, 57, 68 In most of the 9 patients who had CT scans on admission, the abnormalities displayed were bilateral micronodular lesions or groundglass opacities. Whether these patterns are specific of severe measles pneumonitis or simply ascribable to sample bias requires further investigation. Another debatable issue is the reliability of chest imaging to correctly identify patients with bacterial superinfection. Our results are inconclusive, primarily because of the small number of patients with CAP (n = 4). As shown in Table 2 , there did not seem to be any unambiguous pattern suggestive of superinfection: 2 patients had normal *Time elapsed between onset of measles, as defined by onset of morbillous rash, and initiation of therapy, in days. \u2020Number of plasma exchanges. \u2021Treatment withheld due to measles specific treatment-related adverse effects. \u00a7Treatment prematurely stopped due to fear of adverse effects and insufficient evidence of efficacy. chest X-ray exams, 4 patients had bilateral interstitial opacities, 1 had right-sided alveolar opacities, and 1 had bilateral mixed alveolar and interstitial opacities. However, other studies have addressed this question and demonstrated that the presence of a lobar consolidation or dense infiltrate is neither sensitive nor specific of bacterial coinfection. 26, 57 A possible explanation regarding the poor discriminatory performance of chest imaging may reside in the possible natural history of measles-associated interstitial pneumonitis. The dynamic pattern of lesions, as highlighted by the results of repeated scans in 2 patients with measles-associated ARDS, suggests that lobar consolidation might result from the progressive coalescence of micronodular lesions, whether bacterial superinfection occurs or not.",

This relatively low incidence of bacterial pneumonia, especially when compared to other studies, where as many as 50% of patients were reported to have bacterial superinfection, 15,68 may be ascribable to ''preemptive'' antibiotic therapy (51.5% of patients with respiratory symptoms).

All immunocompromised patients progressed towards ARDS, and 4 died. High measles case mortality in the context of HIV coinfection has been previously reported in African children, where malnutrition is often an additional concern, 58 but there is a paucity of data regarding adult patients in countries with a high standard of health care. 32 Why immunocompromised hosts are so vulnerable to MV infection remains to be fully elucidated, 62 but studies in both human patients and other primates point to a delayed virus clearance in case of concurrent immunosuppression, 28, 63 suggesting that immunocompromised patients might be exposed to the virus' deleterious effect for an extended period of time. Accordingly, patients who developed ARDS as a consequence of measles-induced ARDS did so in the later stage of the disease as reflected by the delay between initial symptoms and ICU admission (median, 10 d; IQR, 6Y19 d). Whether severe respiratory impairment in this subset of patients results from the direct consequence of the virus per se or to late bacterial superinfection, as speculated by some authors, remains to be determined. 39 Additionally, immunocompromised patients exposed to MV are likely to develop a specific histopathologic pattern affecting the lung known as Hecht giant cell pneumonia, as was documented in 1 case in the current study. 17, 46 Autopsy findings in this setting include degeneration of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium, interstitial pneumonia, and giant cells in the alveolar wall. 8, 41 Furthermore, the adverse effect of MV on the patient's immune status might combine with the patient's underlying immunosuppression, thus increasing the risk of superinfection.",

Measles gives rise to a myriad of clinical manifestations in the setting of PIE; seizures, meningitis, multifocal neurologic deficit including signs of myelitis, and an altered mental status, such as was observed in our 3 patients, rank among the most commonly reported symptoms. 64 In all 3 patients, mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and hyperproteinorachia on CSF examination were noted as in previous reports. 71 The key pathogenic mechanism in PIE is believed to be demyelination mediated by an autoimmune process during the stage of recovery from infection, generally within 2 weeks of the exanthema. 30 In the current study we were not able to confirm these results, because none of the 3 patients with PIE was tested for the presence of MV in the CSF by PCR. Accordingly, distinctive neuropathologic features, including perivascular inflammation and demyelination, resemble the features of experimental allergic encephalitis. 25 Furthermore, experimental data support the occurrence of T cell-mediated hyperactivity against myelin base protein during the course of the disease. 30 In line with this interpretation, both clinical and imaging features of the disease bear a strong resemblance to acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). 72 In 1 case of PIE, an MRI performed on day 7 following initial symptoms demonstrated a diffuse hypersignal affecting the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar medulla on T2 FLAIR sequence, findings consistent with ADEM, as illustrated in Figure 3 . Brain imaging investigations were negative in the 2 remaining patients. However, in 1 case the sole brain imaging performed was a CT scan, a notoriously insensitive technique to detect the white matter lesions characteristic of ADEM. 79 In the other patient, the MRI imaging was undertaken almost a month after the initial symptoms, therefore transient lesions may have been missed. 29 However, how and why MV elicits an autoimmune response is not clear. 53",

So far, 5 cases have been reported in kidney transplantation recipients. 82 If only a brain biopsy can definitively ascertain the diagnosis of MIBE, the following clinical and laboratory investigations can lend support to this hypothesis: a) normal CSF analysis, b) history of epilepsy both focal and generalized, c) seroconversion during the course of the neurologic disorder, and d) significant clinical improvement after withholding the immunosuppressive regimen. Once again, timely modulation of the patient immunosuppression is critical for both triggering and stalling the neurologic disease progression, at least in the setting of MIBE. This is consistent with previous reports of MIBE in which this complication arises only in case of severe cell-mediated impairment, which causes virus persistence in the central nervous system (CNS) before neurologic symptoms. Apart from transplantation, other clinical settings favorable to MIBE occurrence include mainly HIV infection, chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies, and immunosuppressive therapies for autoimmune diseases. 32, 82 ",

As reported previously, 3,85 liver failure as a result of measles is exceptional, and was not observed in the current study. Asymptomatic rhabdomyolysis is another frequent metabolic disturbance, although its precise mechanism remains elusive. 36, 85 Only on a few occasions can rhabdomyolysis be severe enough to induce acute renal failure, such as in 1 patient in the current study. 74, 86 Finally, lymphopenia is highly prevalent, as exemplified in this study, where it affected 24 of 28 patients (85.7%) for whom a lymphocyte count was readily available on admission. Both its physiopathology and its significance have been reviewed previously.",

            "text": "France has engaged in a bid to promote widespread measles vaccination since 1983 when a single injection of measles vaccine was officially included in the vaccination schedule for infants aged 12Y15 months. 10 In the span of 9 years, immunization against measles rose from 32% (1984) to 80% (1994), while at the same time measles ceased to be an endemic disease among children, and a sharp decline in its associated morbidity and mortality was recorded. 10 However immunization rates then stalled at about 80%, and it was not until 1996 that a second injection was added to the schedule as part of a noncompulsory ''catch up'' program designed for unvaccinated individuals, but also following reports highlighting the risk of waning immunity in the single injection strategy. Yet, immunization still had not reached sufficient levels by the time the 2009Y2011 measles outbreak struck France. 21 Not surprisingly, most of the patients who developed measles in the current series were young adults. First, because it is wellknown that patients from this age group tend to present with more severe measles-associated complications. Second, because in accordance with previous data, all patients who had vaccination status documented (n = 26) either were not vaccinated at all (n = 19) or had received only a single injection of the vaccine (n = 7). Twenty-eight patients (78%) were born during the critical 1980Y1996 period, in a time of poor immunization rates. We can concluded that measles epidemics are largely a reflection of insufficient vaccination coverage, and our results are convergent with evidence stemming from other European countries. 48, 49 Third, it is now clear that an immunization coverage rate short of 95% is unlikely to provide ''herd protection'' or to impede the circulation of measles virus in small groups of unvaccinated subjects, given the virus' extremely contagious nature. 43 As a consequence, these pockets of susceptible individuals act as a reservoir capable of fueling new outbreaks during which unprotected young adults are greatly exposed, hence the gradual shift in the clinical pattern of measles from a childhood and generally benign infection to a lethal disease affecting young adults. Efforts to reinforce measles immunization through vaccination programs have been fraught with resistance from individuals or small communities opposed to vaccination for various reasons including scientific misinformation, 78 religious beliefs or customs, 4,33 misperception of the disease, 67 or exaggerated concerns regarding its safety. 11 Another source of concern is the impact of global travels, which may contribute to measles importation. 48 However the current study does not lend support to this mechanism since all cases of measles were indigenously acquired.",

Five patients exhibited respiratory improvement following initiation of intravenous ribavirin therapy. In immunocompromised patients, experience with ribavirin is at best anecdotal and success has been varied in patients with pneumonitis or MIBE. 32, 50, 80 In the current case series, only 2 patients, both of whom were immunocompromised and had severe measles pneumonitis, had a protracted course of ribavirin. Although ribavirin therapy was initiated promptly after the onset of the disease, both of these immunocompromised patients' respiratory conditions progressed to ARDS, and, ultimately, death. In 1 case, the treatment was withheld after 6 days because of ribavirin-induced hemolysis. In 1 patient affected by MIBE, ribavirin was withdrawn just 2 days after initiation as a result of insufficient evidence to sustain its indication (see Table 4 ).",

Special attention is warranted for immunocompromised individuals, as measles occurring in this setting can lead to life-threatening complications that may require ICU management. Diagnosis of measles infection in the immunocompromised patient can be challenging in the face of specific complications and absent or atypical morbillous rash. When managing patients with measles pneumonitis using mechanical ventilation, physicians should be aware that these patients may be predisposed to barotrauma. Airway bacterial superinfection, likely to be favored by MV-induced immunosuppression, represents an additional concern and should be actively sought for each time a patient presents with severe respiratory impairment. Immunomodulatory therapy and antiviral treatment with ribavirin may play a role in the management of patients affected by PIE and measles-induced ARDS, but further investigations are needed before they can be considered a standard of care. Until then, primary prevention by adequate vaccination remains the most effective therapeutic means during communitywide outbreaks.",
