According to these studies, destructive changes such as demyelination, axon degeneration, vasogenic edema, and hemorrhage occur in the white matter when temperatures over 42 ~ are sustain ed for about 60 rain [1, 7, 12, 17, 18] . In a previous study [20] , we reported that heat treatment of the spinal cord using a hot water-perfused tube can produce a confined lesion in the dorsal funiculus of the rat. In the affected area most myelinated nerve fibers were completely demyelinated, while the axons themselves remained almost unaffected. These denuded axons began to be remyelinated by Schwann cells or oligodendrocytes about 2 weeks after treatment, and were almost fully remyelinated by 1 month after treatment. Four weeks after heat treatment, among axons normally remyelinated by Schwann cells or oligodendrocytes, we noticed some axons with aberrant \"double\" myelin sheaths, i.e., the axon was surrounded Offprint request to: M.

To produce the heat injury to the spinal cord, the bent end of a polyethylene tube of 2 mm in diameter was placed on the dura mater for 60 min using a stereotaxic device. Hot water warmed by a water bath was perfused through the tube, and the temperature of the tube surface was maintained at 48~176 as monitored by a thermocouple probe of 1.0-ram diameter located approximately 1 cm from the bent end. After such treatment, the wound was closed in anatomical layers. The details of the operation and treatment have been described previously [20] .",

Among them, one PNS-type myelin sheath covered the full length of the internodal segment of the internal myelin sheath (Fig. 3) . This inner myelin sheath showed the following morphological characteristics: (1) interlamellar periodicity was about 13 nm; (2) it had a short and thin internode similar to some other regenerated CNS-type myelin sheath; and (3) no cytoplasmic component suggesting a Schwann cell channel and no basal lamina were found. These findings support the idea that inner mylin sheath is the CNS type, because these findings are adequete to the morphological criteria of CNS-type regenerated myelin sheath shown in our recent paper [20] .

This so-called \"transitional internode\" showed the insertion of the CNS-type myelin sheaths into the PNS-type ones in the same manner as described in the present study [21. In the present study the longitudinal sections clearly showed the relationships of the two different types of myelin sheaths in the aberrant remyelination. Absence of the astrocyte processes at the site of apposition of Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes might be considered one of basic factors for the genesis of such an aberrant remyelination. In lesions made by treatments other than heat [6, 8, 191 nerve fibers with new CNS-type myelin sheaths are always surrounded by astrocyte processes, thus being definitely separated from PNStype myelinated fibers. This means that Schwann ceils cannot invade the CNS compartment. Similarly, in the case of normal dorsal root entry, astrocyte processes are always present between the PNS-and CNS-type myelin sheaths, thus keeping them from being in direct contact with each other [2, 3] . However, in the case of the aberrant transitional internode as reported by Berthold [2] , cytoplasm of the Schwann cells was partly in direct contact with the CNS-type myelin sheath. This aberrant transitional internode is considered to be formed by accidental direct contact of Schwann cells with oligodendrocytes at an early myelination during normal development.",

In this case Schwann cells can occasionally abut on oligodendrocytes without astrocyte intervention [13, 22] . Nevertheless, no overlapping of PNS-and CNS-type myelin sheaths has been reported in these studies, indicating that in addition to the primary requisite of the direct contact of Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes, there are some other unknown factors necessary for the formation of aberrant remyelination as described in the present study.",

            "text": "Why does the PNS-type myelin always cover the CNS-type one? Concerning the PNS \"double myelination\" in the sympathetic nervous system, Kidd and Heath [15, 16] have demonstrated that the outer Schwann cell failed to make contact with an axon, yet its myelin sheath remained intact [17] . This result suggests the ensheathning cell of the PNS-type myelin does not necessarily attach itself to the axons. In the present study lateral loops of PNS-type myelin firmly attached themselves to outer surface of the CNS-type myelin with a spacing of about 15 rim. Since the distance between these two kinds of myelin is characteristic to the glia-axonal interaction mediated by myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) [23] , this phenomenon suggests an adhesion molecule of the PNS-type myelin, i.e., MAG, can form tight interaction to the CNS-type myelin as well as to the axonal surface. In addition, considering that the CNS-type remyelination occurs earlier than the PNS-type after heat injury, it would be highly unlikely that oligodendrocytes migrate to cover the PNS-type myelin sheath.",
