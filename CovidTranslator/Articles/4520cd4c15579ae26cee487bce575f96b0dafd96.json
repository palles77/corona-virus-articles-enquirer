Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is a heterogeneous group of diseases that arises from the placental trophoblasts. It includes lesions such as hydatidiform mole (HM), which may be considered as abnormal placenta that is prone to malignant transformation, and frankly malignant tumors such as choriocarcinoma. Most HM will spontaneously regress after suction evacuation. However, about 8% to 30% will develop persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia with metastatic potential requiring chemotherapy. The pathogenesis of GTD remains a controversial issue. [1] [2] [3] NANOG is one of the core transcription factors found in pluripotent embryonic stem cells. 4 NANOG is found to be essential for maintaining self-renewal and pluripotency of both human and mouse embryonic stem cells. [5] [6] [7] [8] On implantation of blastocysts, Nanog mRNA is detected exclusively in the epiblast of the mouse embryo, is finally restricted to primordial germ cells, and becomes undetectable in adult tissues. 9, 10 Embryonic stem cells and cancer cells may be considered to share some similarities in phenotypes. They have the potential to grow rapidly and display high telomerase expression, which is responsible for maintaining their immortality. 11, 12 Trophoblasts and cancer cells may also be comparable regarding their proliferative and invading potential. In HM, activation of telomerase is associated with the development of aggressive gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. 13, 14 Recently, NANOG expression has been reported in human neoplasms, including germ cell tumors, [15] [16] [17] [18] breast carcinomas, 18 and osteosarcoma. 19 Furthermore, ectopic expression of Nanog induced an oncogenic potential in NIH3T3. 20 We postulate that NANOG is important in the development and malignant progression of GTD. In the present study, we attempted to examine the expression of NANOG in GTD in association with clinical outcome and to characterize the in vitro functions of NANOG.",

Fifty formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, including 7 first trimester placentas, 6 term placentas, 20 regressive moles, 11 persistent moles, and 6 choriocarcinomas, were also retrieved. The tissues of HMs and choriocarcinomas were obtained from specimens of uterine evacuate and/or hysterectomy. First trimester and term placentas were collected, after induced abortion by suction evacuation and normal delivery, respectively. Persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia was diagnosed if there was a plateau in human chorionic gonadotrophin level for 4 weeks or a further rise in human chorionic gonadotrophin for three consecutive weeks after evacuation, according to internationally accepted criteria. 21 The histological features of all these cases in H&E-stained sections were determined using generally agreed and accepted diagnostic criteria. [1] [2] [3] Most HM cases had previously been assessed for apoptotic activity by M30 CytoDeath antibody 22 and ploidy analysis by fluores-cent microsatellite genotyping after microdissection and chromosome in situ hybridization. 23, 24 Cell Lines, Cell Culture, and Subcellular Protein Extraction A normal extravillous trophoblast cell line (TEV-1) 25 and three choriocarcinoma cell lines, JEG-3, JAR, and BeWo (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD), were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), and 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA).

The anti-apoptosis effect of NANOG on JEG-3 was found, probably mediated through the regulation of caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavages, suggesting that overexpression of NANOG in choriocarcinoma may contribute to the prolonged survival of cancer cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating such an anti-apoptotic effect of NANOG on cancer cells. Such an anti-apoptotic ability of NANOG is not surprising since regulation of apoptosis is necessary to maintain the self-renewal state of embryonic stem cells. 35, 36 In mouse embryonic stem cells, suppression of Nanog expression by the tumor suppressor p53 was associated with the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into other cell types that undergo efficient p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. 37 Recent reports also demonstrated that Oct-4, another stem cellrelated gene, is essential for protecting mouse embryonic stem cells from stress-related apoptosis. 38 Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic effect of NANOG can also explain the association of higher NANOG expression in HMs that progress to gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, because our earlier studies have demonstrated that HMs with lower apoptotic activity tend to progress and require chemotherapy. 22, 39 In the present study, nuclear NANOG expression was inversely correlated with an apoptotic The expression of total and cleaved forms of caspases-3, -7, and -9, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in control and shNANOG JEG-3 as determined by immunoblot analysis.

Such finding suggested that NANOG may be involved in the malignant progression of trophoblasts. In fact, Nanog has been suggested to have effect on cell migration in studies of migrating primordial germ cells in the mouse. 40 Moreover, ectopic expression of Nanog has been found to promote transformation and growth rate in NIH3T3 cells. 20, 41 Such effects of NANOG on cell invasion seems to be better demonstrated in choriocarcinoma than in extravillous implantation site intermediate trophoblasts (a trophoblast subtype associated with invasive capacity) in normal placentas, because only focal NANOG immunoreactivity was found in this trophoblast subtype. On the other hand, higher NANOG nuclear immunoreactivity was detected in choriocarcinoma, a frankly malignant tumor, as compared with normal placentas. These observations suggested that the effect of NANOG on cell invasion may be cell-type specific. Indeed, different from malignant tumor cells, the invasion of implantation site intermediate trophoblasts occurs in normal placentas during early pregnancy, under precise control and is restricted to the implantation site. [42] [43] [44] In the choriocarcinoma cell line, we further found that the cell-invasion effect of NANOG was likely to be mediated through the down-regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9, two MMPs essential for choriocarcinoma cell invasion. 45 In fact, the promoters of these two likely targets of NANOG have been found to be occupied by NANOG in embryonic stem cells. 46 These observations help to explain the mechanisms regarding the role of NANOG in tumorigenesis.",

Involvement of Nanog in cellular proliferation in NIH3T3 after its ectopic expression has indeed been reported. 20 However, by in vitro studies on choriocarcinoma cells, no change in the proliferation rate after stable knock-down of NANOG could be detected. Our findings suggested that NANOG may not be involved in choriocarcinoma cell proliferation in an in vitro setting. NANOG may be executing its functional roles differently in different environments.",

The mechanism regulating NANOG expression in GTD is not yet known. Indeed, we have attempted to investigate the possible effect of histone deacetylation on NANOG mRNA expression by treating JEG-3 and JAR with Trichostatin A. Our qPCR results showed that Trichostatin A could not induce NANOG mRNA expression in JEG-3 and JAR (unpublished data), implicating that histone acetylation is not involved in the increase expression of NANOG in choriocarcinoma cells. It is also important to determine whether a change in NANOG expression is a primary causal or secondary event in the pathogenesis of GTD. This query needs to be elucidated by more studies in the future. Such findings may assist to define NANOG as a potential therapeutic target in GTD.",
