Thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein yielded a 17 kDa protein. This protein cross-reacted with a monoclonal anti-human TNF-(Y antibody in Western blotting, but not with a polyclonal anti-murine TNF-a serum. Recombinant fI'NF-a (rfTNF-cl!) and rfTNF-cr-GST had a CDS, of 15 ng ml-' and 230 ng ml-', respectively, in the L929 cytotoxicity assay. Cats given rfTNF-a-GST intravenously manifested the typical biological effects of TNF-(u, including fever, depression, and piloerection. The rfTNF-a-GST upregulated IL-2 receptor and MHC-II antigen expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated in vitro, but had no effect on TNF-o receptor and MHC-I antigen expression. 47-22 9648 18. 0165-2427/95/$09.50 0 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

            "text": "Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a ) is a cytokine with multifunctional activity. Although its original activity was recognised against tumour cells (Carswell et al., 1975) , it is now known to play an important role in immune and inflammatory responses as well as in the pathogenesis of many human and animal diseases (reviewed by JHattelH, 199 1). TNF-a may also play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of human AIDS (Matsuyama et al., 199 1) . TNF-c~ stimulates human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in both established lymphoid and primary T cell cultures (Suzuki et al., 1989) . This enhanced replication is mediated through TNF-a inducible nuclear factors like NFkB and the kB enhancer elements of the HIV LTR (Osborn et al., 1989) . Induction of HIV gene expression is regulated by interactions of DNA binding proteins with specific gene sequences (Folks et al., 1989; Osborn et al., 1989; Poli et al., 1990) . The levels of TNF-(w are increased in patients with AIDS and may upregulate virus replication in an autocrine fashion (Poli et al., 1990 ). In addition TNF-a, may play an important role in some clinical manifestations of HIV infection; dramatic improvement in aphthous stomatitis and esophagitis is seen in AIDS patients treated with a TNF-a inhibitor (thalidomide) (Nicolau and West, 1990) . TNF-a! is an important reagent, therefore, for studies of HIV pathogenesis.",

The cloned fragment from the amplification with P2/P3 was digested out with BamHI/EcoRI, and subcloned directly into the expression vector pGEX-2T (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The pGEX-2T vector has been used previously to express FIV-pl7 and -p24 proteins (Reid et al., 199 1) . This expression vector contains an open reading frame encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST), followed by unique restriction endonuclease sites for BamHI, Smal and EcoRZ, followed in turn by termination codons in all three frames. A thrombin cleavage site is constructed into the vector between GST and the protein to be expressed (Chang, 1985 ) . The resulting plasmid, designated pGEX-fT NF, was used to transform the E. coli strain XLl-blue. A 100 ml overnight terrific-broth (T-broth) culture of E. coli containing pGEX-ff NF was diluted 1: 10 in T-broth and incubated for 1 h at 37' C. All bacterial cultures contained 50 ,ug ml-' ampicillin and 12.5 ,ug ml-' tetracycline. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced by adding isopropyl-p-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a concentration of 0.3 mM. The culture was further incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 h and then centrifuged for 10 min at 5OOOxg. The supematant was discarded. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 10 ml ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and sonicated twice for 30 s; samples were kept on ice. Triton-x-100 was added to a concentration of 1%, the solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 10 000 xg, and the supernatant collected. One milliliter of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads was added to the supernatant and gently mixed for 3 min at room temperature, followed by three times washing with PBS.

The cDNA encoding the functional TNF-a gene was derived from mRNA by reverse transcription.

Both proteins killed TNF-a-sensitive L929 mouse cells; rfTNF-cr-GST had a toxic effect on these cells comparable to rfTNF-cx at concentrations above 125 ng ml-', but at levels below 125 ng ml-' rff NF-cu was significantly more toxic than rfINF-(r-GST. This indicated some interference by the GST moiety on the rfTNF-cu portion of the molecule. Polyclonal rabbit anti-human TNF-a prevented the toxic effect of both rfTNF-a-GST and rffNF-a on L929 cells, again demonstrating that both the cleaved and fused fI'NF-a! proteins were biologically and antigenitally intact. The rfTNF-cr-GST was also biologically active when injected intravenously into cats. The onset and the character of clinical signs resembled those observed for TNF-(I! in other species (Creagan et al., 1988) . Since i.v. administration of recombinant GST did not induce any clinical signs, it can be deduced that the in vivo effects were caused by the rff NF-a portion of the fusion protein and not by the GST. As expected, it was shown that rfTNF-a-GST upregulated the expression of IG2R and MHC class II antigens in normal cultures of feline PMBCs. The induction of IG2R and MHC class II antigen mRNA by TNF-a involves the activation of transcriptional factors (Maniatis et al., 1987) . TNF-a activates NFkB proteins that can induce expression of genes possessing kB-like enhancer elements in their regulatory regions (Lowenthal et al., 1989b) . Included in this group are the genes encoding IG2R (Lowenthal et al., 1989a) , MHC class II antigen (Pessara and Koch, 1990) , and human, feline and simian immunodeliciency viruses (Folks et al., 1989; Osbom et al., 1989; Dewhurst et al., 1990; Poli et al., 1990; Sparger et al., 1992) .",
