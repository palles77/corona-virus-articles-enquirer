Nasal swabs for PCR testing for identification of respiratory viruses were obtained on children aged 2-11 y at baseline and when parents thought their child was developing a cold. Parentalrecorded severity of specific symptoms in children with and without a documented viral URI were compared. Nasal swabs were obtained on 108 children whose parents reported their child was developing a cold. A viral etiology was identified in 62 of 108 (57.4%) samples. Symptom measures that best differentiated children with a viral etiology from those without were significant runny nose and significant cough on days 1-4 of the illness. A URI symptom score was developed based on these symptoms, with a sensitivity of 81.4%, specificity of 61.9%, and accuracy of 73.3%. Parental impression is only a moderately accurate predictor of viral URI in children. Our URI symptom score provided a more accurate method for identifying children with viral URIs for clinical studies. (Pediatr Res 68: 252-257, 2010)",

For that study, adult volunteers were randomized to have either saline solution or saline solution containing filtered nasal secretions from individuals with \"typical colds\" instilled in their noses. For the next 14 d, the study participants rated the severity of 12 symptoms of URI on a 0 -3 scale. Those who received the filtered nasal secretions had significantly more severe symptoms than those receiving saline alone; a total symptom severity score of \u054614 was found to be the best cut-off value for defining a URI. This symptom scoring system, commonly referred to as the \"Jackson score,\" continues to be used in studies on URIs in adults (9) . Because the presence of some of the symptoms in the score, such as chilliness and myalgia, may be difficult to detect in preverbal children, the use of the Jackson score in pediatric studies may be limited. Other investigators have characterized symptom patterns in children and adults with known viral URIs (6, 10, 11) . There has been little effort to differentiate symptoms among pediatric patients with a documented viral URI from those of children who have some features of a URI but in whom no virus is detected. Thus, there is a need for a validated symptom checklist, or prediction rule, that accurately predicts the presence of a community-acquired viral URI in children enrolled in clinical studies.",

Each morning, for as long as symptoms persisted, parents were asked to rate the severity of each of these symptoms using the scale: 0 \u03ed none, 1 \u03ed mild, 2 \u03ed moderate, and 3 \u03ed severe. An additional possible response was \"can't tell,\" which was added because it was felt that it would be difficult for parents of young children to rate the presence and severity of some of these symptoms.

The second measure was whether the symptom was present and of \"significant severity,\" corresponding to scores of 0 -1 versus 2-3. With this procedure, 96 different variables defining the presence or absence of symptoms were created (12 symptoms \u03eb 2 measures/symptom \u03eb 4 d of assessment). The rate of presence of each symptom measure in children with a PCR confirmed viral URI and those with a negative PCR (\"no URI\") was then compared using 2 tests. Those symptom measures for which rates in the two groups (viral URI or no URI) were different (p \u03fd 0.20) were classified as candidate symptom measures and included in the next step. For symptoms in which both severity measures (e.g., any runny nose and significant runny nose) were different in patients with and without viral URI, only the measure with the more significant difference was included. In addition, candidate symptom measures in which greater than 10% of parents indicated \"can't tell\" regarding the presence of the symptom were excluded.",

It is also possible that the utility of the symptom score would be different at another time when the distribution of circulating respiratory viruses is different. Subsequent investigation is needed to validate the URI symptom score that we developed. However, we purposefully incorporated a number of features into the development of the score that were designed to maximize its generalizability. First, rather than including symptom measures based solely on a statistical analysis, we modified the URI symptom score to have clinical \"sensibility.\" The precision of the URI symptom score could have been increased in this particular population by weighting some symptoms (29) . We chose the more conservative approach of giving equal weight to relevant symptoms to minimize the effects of statistical quirks of the data set. Finally, we only included symptom measures for which \u03fe90% of parents could adequately rate severity. Because measures included in the URI symptom score (significant runny nose and cough) are intuitively important, it is more likely that the score will perform similarly in other children than if a more complicated prediction rule had been developed.",

The use of this symptom score as an analytic criterion for children enrolled in trials of remedies to treat and/or prevent viral URIs should increase the chance of detecting the efficacy of study interventions in the future.",
