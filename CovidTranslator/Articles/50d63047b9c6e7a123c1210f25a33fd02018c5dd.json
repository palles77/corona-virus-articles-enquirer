Wire-bottom cages may also be used; however, care must be taken to ensure that the mesh is small enough that a limb cannot become entrapped. An area of solid fl ooring should be provided, as uninterrupted time on wire mesh may predispose the guinea pig to pododermatitis. Adequate space is needed in the enclosure for the guinea pig to move about unencumbered with enough space for a hide box. Hide boxes or a secluded space is required for prey species (e.g., rodents) to reduce stress that may lead to disease problems. Substrate products that contain aromatic oils (e.g., cedar and pine shavings) should not be used, as they can act as contact and respiratory irritants. Appropriate bedding materials include recycled newspaper products, shredded paper, and aspen shavings. The enclosure should be cleaned thoroughly on a regular basis (e.g., 2 times per week) because unsanitary conditions predispose the guinea pig to pododermatitis, respiratory, and other health problems. If housed indoors, guinea pig enclosures do not require a cover, as these animals do not typically jump or climb. However, the sides of the enclosure should be high enough to prevent escape (approximately 25 cm). 2 Heavy food containers are recommended to make dumping of the receptacle more diffi cult. All food containers should be easy to disinfect and cleaned regularly, as guinea pigs have a habit of soiling their food bowls. Most guinea pigs readily accept drinking water from a sipper bottle, which will decrease spillage and will keep feces, urine, and bedding from contaminating the water.",

Vitamin C placed in drinking water also degrades rapidly and should be changed daily.

As guinea pigs are often shy animals, they may attempt to hide or escape. The examiner should use a thorough, systematic approach to focus on the respiratory character and rate, posture, and attitude of the animal.

A \"hands-on\" physical examination should begin with the head; the veterinarian should assess the eyes for symmetry or discharge and check that the external pinnae of the guinea pig are hairless, as normal. The external ear canals often contain a small to moderate amount of dark, ceruminous debris. The nasal planum should be dry and fl at, whereas palpation of the ventral mandible may reveal deformities secondary to overgrowth of molar and premolar apices. The guinea pig coat varies somewhat with breed but, in general, should be smooth and shiny. Guinea pigs often have a mild to moderate amount of dark sebaceous debris on the skin of the dorsum. Older male guinea pigs may develop a focal accumulation of this debris at the base of the vertebral column, which may be referred to as the \"grease gland.\" 4 Thoracic auscultation and abdominal palpation can be performed as in other patients. Heart and respiratory rates will vary depending on the degree of stress a patient experiences. As pulse and respiratory rates can be very rapid, careful auscultation is necessary to detect subtle abnormalities (e.g., murmurs, crackles, wheezes). Auscultation of gut sounds is also an important part of the guinea pig physical exam. A healthy guinea pig should have 1 to 2 borborygmi per minute. The practitioner should keep in mind that stress will decrease gastrointestinal (GI) motility; therefore, a stressed animal will often have a decrease in borborygmi. Structures normally found on abdominal palpation include kidneys, urinary bladder, cecum, and intestines. Fecal pellets are often palpable in the colon. Careful examination may reveal the presence of abnormalities such as GI distention, masses, or, in females, ovarian cysts. Limbs and joints should be carefully evaluated because thickened or painful joints may be indicative of a vitamin C defi ciency.",

The urine of guinea pigs is typically yellow to amber in color, but it may be darker and more orange depending on the patient's diet. Pigments in the urine can sometimes be mistaken for hematuria, so differentiation is important. Because guinea pigs are herbivores, the pH of guinea pig urine is alkaline, usually 8.0 to 9.0. Crystalluria may be seen but is not a normal fi nding. If crystals are found in a urine sample, the guinea pig patient should be examined for urinary calculi. To minimize rotation, care should be taken to extend the limbs symmetrically when positioning the patient. Because guinea pigs have stocky builds with short limbs, and because they resent aggressive restraint, sedation or anesthesia is helpful in obtaining diagnostic radiographs as well as in reducing the patient's stress ( Figure 17 -11). Table 17 -1 is a guideline for radiographic techniques used in common small mammal radiographic studies. Dental malocclusion is a common disease problem in guinea pigs. Radiographs of the skull are helpful in assessing the degree of malocclusion as well as potential bone involvement. In addition to lateral and dorsoventral views of the skull, right and lateral oblique views can help to localize lesions. Magnifi ed views of the skull can be obtained by placing the patient on an elevated platform under the x-ray beam without changing the distance between the x-ray cassette and beam.",

When the molars and premolars do not occlude properly, overgrowth of the crowns and reserve crowns takes place. With improper wear, sharp points can form on the buccal aspects of the maxillary cheek teeth and the lingual aspects of the mandibular cheek teeth.

This disease will cause severe swellings of the lymph nodes in the cervical region in guinea pigs. Affected guinea pigs will frequently exhibit no other clinical signs but may become septicemic, with lesions affecting the heart, lungs, kidney, and skin. 20 The most effective treatment for cervical lymphadenitis is complete surgical excision of the affected lymph nodes, followed by appropriate antibiotic therapy based on culture and sensitivity testing. Lancing and draining the abscesses is often not curative, as the abscesses form thick capsules that harbor organisms, leading to recurrence. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis has also been shown to cause cervical lymphadenitis in guinea pigs. 17 Although the affected guinea pigs are usually not ill, the concern is that rupture of the abscesses will release large amounts of this potentially zoonotic organism into the environment. Another potential causal agent of cervical lymphadenitis is Streptobacillus moniliformis. 32 One report exists of a cervical mass, initially believed to be cervical lymphadenitis, which was histologically determined to be a thyroid papillary adenoma. 33 The mass was apparently nonfunctional and the guinea pig appeared otherwise healthy, but surgical resection was curative.",

After induction, the inhalant anesthetic may be switched to isofl urane if cost is an issue. Guinea pigs should not be fasted more than 2 to 3 hours before anesthesia.
