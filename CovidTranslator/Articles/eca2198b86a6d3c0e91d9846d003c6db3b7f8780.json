Antibodies against some strains of MHV have been detected in the sera of other species such as human or rat (8), but these antibodies may be evoked by MHV or other coronaviruses that crossreact with MHV. When inoculated experimentally by intracerebral route, hamsters and rats as well as mice were shown to be sensitive to a strain of 5~V , J H M (I, 5), but there was no evidence that MHVs infect these animals when inoculated perorMly or intranasMly (i.n.)

In the present study, we clearly demonstrated that by the intranasal route MHV-S infects rats of various ages from the following criteria: 1. MHV replicated in the \"anterior part of the head\" and several other organs; 2. viral antigen was detected by immunoftuoreseenee in the epithelial cells of nasal mneosa where histopathological changes were also found ; 3. rats of all ages produced neutralizing antibodies after virus inoculation.

The pathogenesis of NHV-S infection in rats resembles, in part, that of SDAV or I~CV, in that these viruses cause the necrotic changes in the epithelial cells of the nasal mucosa at early stage of infection (2) .

However, no rats showed any clinical signs during 14 days of observation. Neutralizing antibody was detected first on day 6, and thereafter rapidly increased in titer as sho~rn in Figure t.
