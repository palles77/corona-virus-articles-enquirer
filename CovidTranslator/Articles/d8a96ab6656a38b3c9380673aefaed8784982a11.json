Design Serial cross-sectional design with four consecutive surveys. setting Nationwide general population in South Korea. Participants Overall 4010 respondents (aged 19 years and over) from the general population during the MERS-CoV epidemic were included. Primary and secondary outcome measures The main outcome measures were (1) affective risk perception, (2) cognitive risk perception, and (3) trust in the government. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors (demographic, socioeconomic, area and political orientation) associated with risk perceptions. results Both affective and cognitive risk perceptions decreased as the MERS-CoV epidemic progressed. Proportions of affective risk perception were higher in all surveys and slowly decreased compared with cognitive risk perception over time. Females (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.72-2.00; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.86) and lower self-reported household economic status respondents were more likely to perceive the affective risk. The older the adults, the higher the affective risk perception, but the lower the cognitive risk perception compared with younger adults. The respondents who had low trust in the government had higher affective (aOR 2.19-3.11; 95 CI 1.44 to 4.67) and cognitive (aOR 3.55-5.41; 95 CI 1.44 to 9.01) risk perceptions. Conclusions This study suggests that even if cognitive risk perception is dissolved, affective risk perception can continue during MERS-CoV epidemic. Risk perception associating factors (ie, gender, age and self-reported household economic status) appear to be noticeably different between affective and cognitive dimensions. It also indicates that trust in the government influences affective risk perception and cognitive risk perception. There is a need for further efforts to understand the mechanism regarding the general public's risk perception for effective risk communication.",

[10] [11] [12] A relevant empirical study emphasised that informing public about the disease outbreak, such as the Ebola virus, could reduce worry about contracting the virus and take more preventive measures. 13 The evaluation of public risk perception of disease helps us to know what knowledge the public needs. Therefore, understanding the characteristics of risk perception and factors relating to how people perceive the risk is important in terms of minimising the impact of spread of infectious disease.",

Affective risk perception was assessed using the question 'How much worried are you that you could get MERS?' Responses were assessed on a 4-point scale, with 4 points indicating 'very much worried' and 1 point indicating 'not worried at all' (reclassified as 1-2 points='not worried'; 3-4 points='worried'). Affective risk perception proportion was defined as the number of participants who were 'worried' by the number of eligible respondents. Cognitive risk perception was evaluated using the question 'Do you think MERS epidemic will settle down in the next few days or spread further?' and required the following responses: 'will settle down', 'will spread further'. Cognitive risk perception proportion was defined as the number of participants whose response was 'will spread further' by the number of eligible respondents. Trust in government was assessed using presidential job approval rating. Trust in government includes expectations of government's competence to prevent people from risk and develop and implement follow-up measures. 31 This trust concept can be termed competence-based trust. 32 33 We tried to assess the competence-based trust in the government using presidential job approval rating. Presidential job approval was evaluated using the question 'Do you approve or disapprove of the way President Park Geun-hye is handling her job as president?' and required the following responses: 'approval', 'disapproval'. The development of questionnaires on risk perception and trust in the government had not gone through a validity procedure due to the urgency of the outbreak. We also imposed survey items on existing questionnaire developed by Gallup Korea, an affiliation of Gallup International.",

Differences were investigated between affective and cognitive risk proportions throughout the epidemic periods. Overall risk perception of the four surveys at affective proportion (53.8%) was nearly two times higher than at cognitive dimension (30.3%). Affective risk perception proportions were always higher than cognitive dimension during the present study periods. Of the affective risk perception, proportion was initially high during survey 1 (55.0%), rose during survey 2 (62.8%) and declined again during surveys 3 and 4 (52.2% and 44.9%, respectively). A similar trend was observed in the cognitive risk perception proportions. The percentages of respondents who reported as being 'worried' or 'spread further' decreased gradually after survey 2. Cognitive risk perception proportions decreased more rapidly than affective aspect, over time, from 52.6% and 62.8% in survey 2 to 9.0% and 44.9% in survey 4, respectively.

In the group that did not approve of the president, the probabilities of risk perception were higher at the cognitive dimension than at affective dimension.
