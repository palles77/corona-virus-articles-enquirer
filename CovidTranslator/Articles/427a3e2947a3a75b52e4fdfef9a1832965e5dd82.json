            "text": "The notion that an infectious respiratory pathogen can damage the central nervous system (CNS) and lead to neurological disease was tested using a human respiratory coronavirus, the OC43 strain of human coronavirus (HCoV-OC43). First, primary cell cultures were used to determine the susceptibility of each type of neural cells to virus infection. Neurons were the target cells, undergoing degeneration during infection, in part due to apoptosis. Second, neuropathogenicity was investigated in susceptible mice. Intracerebral inoculation of HCoV-OC43 into BALB/c mice led to an acute encephalitis with neuronal cell death by necrosis and apoptosis. Infectious virus was apparently cleared from surviving animals, whereas viral RNA persisted for several months. Some of the animals surviving to acute encephalitis presented an abnormal limb clasping reflex and a decrease in motor activity starting several months post-infection. These results suggest that viral persistence could be associated with an increased neuronal degeneration leading to neuropathology and motor deficits in susceptible individuals.",

            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCoV), designated as strains HCoV-OC43 (group 2) and HCoV-229E (group 1), are recognized respiratory pathogens responsible for up to one third of common colds (McIntosh, 1996; Myint, 1994) , as well as nosocomial infections (Sizun et al., 2000) . They have occasionally been associated with other pathologies, such as pneumonia, meningitis, enteritis (Resta et al., 1985; Riski and Hovi, 1980) , and more recently in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (Yeh et al., 2004) . During the 2002-2003 epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of SARS (Peiris et al., 2003) . Its nucleotide sequence presents some degree of homology with coronaviruses of groups 1 and 3 (Rest and Mindell, 2003) but mostly with group 2 (Snijder et al., 2003) . The complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV shows 53.1% identity with HCoV-OC43 (St-Jean et al., 2004) . Even though SARS is mainly characterized by a pulmonary infection with high infectivity and fatality (Nie et al., 2003) , SARS-CoV RNA was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients (Hung et al., 2003; Lau et al., 2004) , and SARS-CoV-positive cells were reported in autopsied brain samples by in situ hybridization (Ding et al., 2004) . More recently, infectious virus was detected in brain tissue of a SARS patient (Xu et al., 2005) . These reports are consistent with neuroinvasive properties of this virus, as it has been reported for other HCoV strains (Arbour et al., 2000; Burks et al., 1980; Murray et al., 1992; Stewart et al., 1992; Yeh et al., 2004) . Furthermore, the neuroinvasive properties of SARS-CoV were recently reported in mouse CNS (Glass et al., 2004) . Thus, a neurotropic and neuroinvasive virus entering the brain could directly trigger neurodegeneration and/or initiate a CNS-directed inflammatory process leading to central nervous system (CNS) damage. HCoV may thus be involved in neurological disorders.",

When virus reached the CNS, infected mice developed acute encephalitis resulting from neuronal infection.

A combination of specific cell markers and virus-specific reagents was used to determine which cell types were susceptible to HCoV-OC43 infection. Glial cells alone were shown to be susceptible to viral infection, but only in a nonproductive fashion, whereas neurons were productively infected and were definitively identified as viral targets.

Numerous dorsal root ganglion (DRG)neurons in neuron-enriched cultures (Fig. 2) , or DRG-neurons with Schwann cells (SC) (data not shown), were infected. Cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed after viral infection, especially in pure DRG-N cultures. Infected DRG-N exhibited signs of degeneration, starting with the formation of retraction balls, beading of axons, and loss of oriented axonal neurites (Fig. 2, D and E) , whereas axonal neurites of noninfected neurons were more linear and showed no beading (Fig. 2, F) . Moreover, after infection, neurons appeared to be more aggregated, with fewer axonal neurites as compared to neurons in the noninfected wells ( Fig. 2: compare B and F). In DRG-N/ SC, cytopathic effects were less pronounced, although some infected neurons did exhibit beading and nonlinearity of axonal neurites (data not shown). Double immunofluorescence staining confirmed that mainly neurons were susceptible to viral infection in DRG-N/SC cultures. Occasionally, a few SCs were positive for viral antigens (data not shown).",

            "text": "To confirm the biological relevance of these in vitro observations, we determined whether viral infection of mouse CNS could also induce neuronal apoptosis. As previously reported, intracerebral inoculation of HCoV-OC43 into mice led to a generalized infection of the CNS, which also affected the hippocampus (Jacomy and Talbot, 2003) . Mice recovering from infection were all found to be seropositive for HCoV-OC43, confirming that they were indeed infected (data not shown). Double immunostaining for viral antigens and TUNEL assays were performed on brain sections during the acute phase of the encephalitis at 11 days post-infection (11 dpi). Isolated TUNEL-positive cells could be seen in the cortical area and the striatum: in these regions, most of the infected cells did not show the hallmarks of apoptosis. In the hippocampus, some neurons in the CA1 and some in the CA3 layers were TUNEL-positive, and numerous cells, in the same region, were also positive for viral antigens (Fig. 5 , panels A-B and F-G). The merged pictures illustrate that some of the infected neurons underwent apoptosis (Fig. 5 , panels C, D, and G), and that noninfected cells localized near the infected ones were also undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 5 , panel E). After an intracerebral inoculation of 10 \u03bcl of an HCoV-OC43 virus stock containing 10 6 TCID 50 /ml, about 80% of BALB/c mice survived. From 6 months to a year postinfection, some of these surviving animals exhibited abnormal reflexes (limb clasping). When normal mice were suspended by the tail, they extended their legs, whereas infected mice reflexively contracted their four limbs (Figs. 6, panel C). At 6 months post-infection, 9 of the 29 surviving mice presented limb clasping, and at 1 year post-infection, 7 of the 21 remaining animals did. Thus, limb clasping affected about 30% of the surviving BALB/c mice. Mice with abnormal reflexes (clasping) were classified as symptomatic and mice with normal reflexes were classified as asymptomatic. Moreover, symptomatic animals presented clinical signs of decreased activity in an open field test (Fig. 6E) . A decreased number of counts was considered to represent a decrease in locomotor activity. Indeed, symptomatic mice showed hypoactivity and a decreased exploration pattern, as sniffing and sifting were markedly diminished, as compared to asymptomatic or normal mice. One year post-infection, cresyl violet staining of the CNS of symptomatic surviving mice revealed that the hippocampus was smaller in size, with hippocampal cell layers less dense than in control or asymptomatic mice (Figs. 6B and D) and also presented reduced CA1 and CA3 hippocampus fields. Neuronal apoptosis and necrosis taking place during the acute phase of the disease could explain only part of the tissue loss of hippocampal gyrus observed in infected mice which survived to the acute virus-induced encephalitis, as demonstrated by the observation of hippocampal regions, 6 months post-infection, where neuronal loss in hippocampal layers were less pronounced (Fig. 7) . Moreover, some brains treated for histological staining revealed infiltration and activated microglia spreading into different CNS regions, especially in the hippocampus (Fig. 8) , illustrating the chronic state of the disease. Whereas no viral antigens could be detected, viral mRNA could be detected in some symptomatic mice using a nested RT-PCR assay (Fig. 6F ) but remained undetectable in asymptomatic mouse brains. As previously reported (Jacomy and Talbot, 2003) , RT-PCR amplification of the HCoV-OC43 N RNA with primer pairs O1-O3 was not sensitive enough to demonstrate viral persistence in mouse brain, although this has now been achieved with a more sensitive nested RT-PCR technique, using the O1.1-O3.1 nested primer pairs (Fig. 6F ).",

Previous studies targeting neurons have indicated susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection of immortalized neuronal cell lines (Arbour et al., 1999; Collins, 1995) , as well as neurons in primary cultures of mouse DRG (Pearson and Mims, 1985) . The current study extends these previous reports by showing that the respiratory human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 has a preferential tropism for neurons, and that it induces cytopathic effects after establishing a productive infection of these cells. Axons of infected neurons exhibited a typical beaded pattern, a result of the underlying pathology. Beading constrictions are due to changes in the cytoskeleton (Ochs et al., 1996) , and microtubules disruption could constitute a major process in the apoptotic response (Mollinedo and Gajate, 2003) . Oxidative stress has also been associated with axonal swelling developing into axonal beading (Roediger and Armati, 2003) .",

In glial cortical cell cultures, a measurable infectious viral titer was produced, whereas almost pure astrocytes or oligodendrocytes cultures failed to release infectious viral particles. This is consistent with a synergy between glial cells: astrocytes, microglia, and fibroblasts could release soluble factors such as cytokines or chemokines which may induce changes in cell surface receptors and transcription factors that favor viral entry and productive replication. Indeed, it was reported that HIV may infect cells that do not express receptors for viral entry (Rozmyslowicz et al., 2003) , and that stress could influence the immune response and alter the pathophysiology of infection (for review, see Padgett and Glaser, 2003) .",

Neuroinvasive properties of HCoV-OC3 Paris were demonstrated in young mice (St-Jean et al., 2004) . On the other hand, 21 DPN C57Bl/6 mice were more resistant to intracerebral inoculation of HCoV-OC43 Paris, as only a higher dose (\u00d710 5 ) could induce acute encephalitis.

Caspases are the principal executors of apoptotic cell death, and caspase-3 was identified as a key mediator in mammalian cells (Nicholson et al., 1995) . We show that coronavirus-induced apoptosis involved DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation, and that some noninfected cells, in close proximity to infected ones, also stained for apoptotic markers, suggesting that infected cells or adjacent glial cells, activated by the infection, secreted molecules that induce death signals in noninfected cells. Activated microglial cell are known to be one of the major source of TNF-\u03b1 (Gimsa et al., 2000; Guidotti and Chisari, 2001) , which can induce neuronal apoptosis (Robertson et al., 2001; Shi et al., 1998; Talley et al., 1995) . We show here that HCoV-OC43-infected cultures rapidly released a high amount of TNF-\u03b1 that could be responsible for at least part of the apoptosis observed in neighboring noninfected neurons. Further understanding of how TNF-\u03b1 participates in viral pathogenesis remained to be clarified.",

Even though most of the infected cells degenerated after vacuolation (Jacomy and Talbot, 2003) , we now report that, during the acute phase of the disease, some of the infected and noninfected neurons underwent apoptosis, especially in the hippocampal layers. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (Rubio et al., 2003) and Sindbis virus (Kimura and Griffin, 2003) were also reported to induce apoptosis, with most of the infected cells not showing hallmarks of apoptosis, as we also observed following HCoV-OC43 infection. The murine counterpart of HCoV-OC43, MHV, was also reported to induce apoptosis in mouse brain (Chen and Lane, 2002; Wu and Perlman, 1999; Schwartz et al., 2002) . Apoptosis induced by coronaviral infection could be associated with HCoV-mediated neuropathogenesis by killing cells or by disseminating virus while limiting inflammatory responses. Indeed, neuronal apoptosis seems to represent an important contributing factor to acute CNS injury in humans after viral infection (DeBiasi et al., 2002; Nakai et al., 2003) and in HIV-associated dementia (Garden, 2002; Kolson, 2002) .",

            "text": "Although histological analysis of mouse brain performed 1 year post-infection failed to detect HCoV-OC43 antigens, some of the animals showed neuronal cell loss, especially in the hippocampal region, and sometimes, clusters of gliosis were disseminated in the CNS. Histological examination of hippo-campal layers revealed that neuronal cell loss was more severe than what was observed during the acute phase of the disease or histological examination performed at 6 months postinfection. During the active phase of encephalitis, neuronophagia, activated microglial cells and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates were present. In the more chronic phase, evidence of neuronal loss predominated and was sometimes associated with gliosis. Presumably, toxic compounds released by activated microglial cells could cause a nonspecific immune destruction of neurons (McGeer and McGeer, 2002) . Longterm pathologic changes in the hippocampus were also described after Sindbis virus infection (Kimura and Griffin, 2003) . In the current study, the decreased density of neuronal layers of the hippocampus apparently correlated with viral persistence in the brain, as monitored by the presence of viral RNA. A reduced hippocampus could trigger deficits in higher neurological functions such as learning and memory, in addition to neurological disabilities observed in these animals. Interestingly, a growing number of human studies have shown dramatic alterations in learning, memory, attention, and motor functions following cytokine treatments (Connor and Leonard, 1998) .",

Even though mice are not the natural host for HCoV-OC43 infections, they may contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and neuropathological consequences of coronavirus infections in humans. Furthermore, recent reports on the presence of SARS-CoV in patient brains are consistent with neuroinvasive properties of SARS-CoV in humans (Hung et al., 2003; Lau et al., 2004; Ding et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2005) .

After the last filtration of tissue suspension through a 150-\u03bcm nylon mesh, the resulting suspension was centrifuged for 7 min at 200\u00d7g and then resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 12.5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). Cells were plated on poly-L-ornithine-precoated (p-L-Orn) flasks and incubated at 37\u00b0C , in a humid atmosphere containing 5% (v/v) CO 2 . Culture medium was changed after 3 days and every 2 days thereafter. The initial mixed glial cultures, grown for 9 to 11 days, were placed on a rotary shaker at 37\u00b0C for 3 h to remove loosely attached macrophages. Oligodendrocyte progenitors and microglia were detached from the astrocyte-like matrix following shaking for 18 h at 260 rpm. After filtration, cells were plated on a plastic surface for 3 h. In these conditions, microglia attached and oligodendrocyte progenitors remaining in suspension were separated and plated on multi-well dishes precoated with poly-D-lysine at an approximate density of 1.5 \u00d7 10 3 /cm 2 . Cultures were maintained in serum-free medium (SFM) containing 2.5 ng/ml human recombinant platelet derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA) and 2.5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF; PeproTech Inc.) to stimulate proliferation, and medium was changed every 2 days. Ninety-five percent of the cells reacted positively with monoclonal antibody A2B5 (ATCC), a marker for oligodendrocyte progenitors. Progenitor cultures were differentiated to oligodendrocytes in SFM without PDGF-AA and b-FGF, which was supplemented with 3% (v/v) calf serum after day 3.

For RT-PCR, one pair of HCoV-OC43 primers was designed to amplify a region of 305 nucleotides (primers O1 and O3) of the gene coding for the N protein (Arbour et al., 1999) . Approximately 5 \u03bcg of RNA was reversed transcribed with Expand Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (GibcoBRL), and the cDNA products were amplified by 30 PCR amplification cycles as previously described (Jacomy and Talbot, 2003) . A nested PCR was performed on these RT-PCR amplicons using primers O1.1-O3.1 (Arbour et al., 2000) : 40 amplification cycles were performed. Ten microliters of RT-PCR and nested RT-PCR products was loaded onto a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel containing 5 \u03bcl ethidium bromide.",

A Plexiglass plate measuring 45 \u00d7 45 cm was divided with 3 lines each separated by 15 cm. The animals were left in the center of the Plexiglass plate for 5 min to explore the novel environment. Activity was recorded by measuring the number of crossing of lines, when a mouse removed all four paws from one square and entered another. Mice were assigned to three experimental groups: control (10 mice), asymptomatic (14 mice), and symptomatic (7 mice). A decrease in number of counts was considered as a decrease in locomotor activity. The Plexiglass was carefully cleaned between tests. Sniffing and sifting were also observed (Clifford et al., 2002) .",
