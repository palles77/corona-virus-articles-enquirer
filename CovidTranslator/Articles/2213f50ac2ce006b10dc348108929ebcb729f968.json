The difficulty in designing conserved Pestivirus primers for the amplification of genomes from highly divergent isolates simply by means of overlapping segments is demonstrated using new bioinformatic tools. An alternative procedure consisting of optimizing the length of the genomic cDNA fragments and their subsequent amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a limited set of specific primers is described. The amplification of long DNA fragments from a variety of sources, including genomic, mitochondrial, and viral DNAs as well as cDNA produced by reverse transcription (RT) has been achieved using this methodology, known as long distance PCR. In the case of viruses, it is necessary to obtain viral particles from infected cells prior to RT procedures. This work provides improvements in four steps of long distance RT-PCR (L-RT-PCR): (i) preparation of a viral stock, (ii) preparation of template RNA, (iii) reverse transcription and (iv) amplification of the cDNA by LD-PCR. The usefulness of L-RT-PCR is discussed in the light of current knowledge on pestivirus diversity. The genomic sequence of Singer Arg reference strain obtained using this method is presented and characterized.",

LD-PCR methods capable of amplifying long viral DNA genomes have been described (Barnes, 1994) . Complete double stranded genomic RNA fragments of 0.8-6.8 kb have been successfully amplified (Potgieter et al., 2002) . Complete genomes and long genomic regions of up to 10 kb long from other positive stranded RNA viruses have been reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR (Lindberg et al., 1997; Lindberg and Andersson, 1999; Holterman et al., 2000; Lu et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2001) . Long fragments of up to 20 kb from coronavirus genomic RNA have been successfully amplified by using a purification step previous to the RT (Thiel et al., 1997) .

The programming language used was OCaml (http://caml.inria.fr/index.en.html), which allows portability to a wide range of platforms. The output, termed a diversity profiles, consists of: (i) the number of nucleotidic substitutions as implied by phylogenetic tree and (ii) the number of alignment columns with nucleotidic variation. The alignment block width is chosen by the user. The difference between our approach and previous attempts to measure sequence diversity is the incorporation of phylogenetic information.

Fig. 1 depicts the analysis of an alignment of pestiviral genomes. Fig. 1a shows that only two regions of the genome (located near to the 5 -end) present invariable blocks. Fig. 1b shows a profile calculated by counting the number of variable columns on each possible block of 20 columns. Analogous analyses using 18-22 nt long blocks resulted in similar profiles. These results explain the difficulty of finding primers that can anneal to genomic sequences from a broad taxonomic range. That is why it was decided to use a strategy based on the amplification of one or few long genomic regions. As discussed in Section 4, a L-RT-PCR is more efficient and accurate than amplifying many short RT-PCR overlapping fragments covering the whole genome.",

In pestiviruses, the success of overlapping cDNA amplification can rely on many trial and error assays since primers capable of amplifying one viral isolate or species are usually not necessarily suitable for another (e.g. Ridpath and Bolin, 1995; Avalos-Ramirez et al., 2001; Oberste et al., 2002) . The amplification of long or full-length RNA spans using the methods described herein could represent an improvement compared to sequencing many short overlapping cDNA fragments. If the regions in which we located L-RT-PCR primers are relatively conserved, it could be possible to use one set of primers to amplify the genome of many diverse viral genotypes. In the worst case one would need to design primers for each genotype. However, in this situation the number of primers to design and test would be dramatically lower than in the case in which short overlapping PCR fragments are used.
