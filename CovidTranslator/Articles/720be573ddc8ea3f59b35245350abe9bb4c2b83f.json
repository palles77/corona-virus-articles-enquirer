They include urinary tract infection, endometritis, wound infection, vaginal cuff cellulitis, perineal infection, and sepsis, which lead to prolonged hospital stays and increased health care costs. Much work has been done to study the effect of prophylactic antibiotics in reducing infectious morbidity. A plethora of antibiotic types, dosing schedules, and routes of administration have been investigated. There is evidence to support the use of prophylactic antibiotics for a number of procedures in gynaecology. Unfortunately, few comparative trials have been conducted, leaving the clinician with uncertainty as to which regimen is superior.",

Antibiotic resistance development results mainly from the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Incomplete courses of antibiotic therapies and the unnecessary use of broader spectrum regimens play a role. 2 Adherence to treatment and prophylaxis guidelines likely assists in reducing infection and antibiotic resistance. Physician adherence to antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines is variable and frequently at odds with published guidelines. 3, 4 In addition to antibiotic prophylaxis, all factors that affect infectious risk reduction in our specialty must be reviewed. Sterile surgical fields must be ensured, and ongoing quality assessment of sterilization technique, air ventilation, and postoperative wound care are needed. Consistent infection control surveillance and reporting of infectious complications track ability to minimize these morbidities and possibly to identify clusters of infection and the emergence of antibiotic resistant organisms. This will dictate changes to operative routines to respond to evolving microbial diversity that seems inevitable.",

The most recent, by Tanos and Rojansky in 1994, 14 compared 17 trials (n = 2752) that used single dose or up to 24 hours of intramuscular or intravenous cephalosporins. There was a significant reduction in the incidence of infection in the treatment groups (OR = 0.35; 95% CI 0.3 to 0.4). Febrile morbidity was prevented by first-generation cephalosporins but not by some second-and third-generation choices. The authors concluded that a single dose of a first-or secondgeneration cephalosporin was efficacious and cost-effective. Mittendorf et al. 15 (1993) meta-analyzed 25 RCTs (n = 3604) with varying antibiotic choice, duration, and routes of administration. They found that serious infections were less common in the treatment groups (9% vs. 21.1%, P = 0.001). Among those who received cefazolin or metronidazole, 11.4% and 6.3% respectively had serious postoperative infections. Lastly, Wttewaall-Evelaar 16 (1990) examined 17 RCTs, the majority of which (14 of 17) used first-or secondgeneration cephalosporins. Infections were significantly reduced in the treatment groups (P < 0.001).",

The benefit was seen in women considered to be at high risk and in those at low risk for infection; thus, the authors conclude that universal prophylaxis should be given and that no more placebocontrolled trials should be performed.

The largest trial to date (n = 1074), which had the most statistically significant reduction in postoperative infection rates (RR 0.12; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.38), used doxycycline 100 mg orally before the procedure followed by 200 mg after the procedure. 28 Other regimens that have been effective in a randomized trial include metronidazole 400 mg orally 1 hour before the procedure and then repeated 4 and 8 hours after the procedure (RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.83) 29 and doxycycline 400 mg orally 10 to 12 hours before the procedure (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.73) 30 A cost-effectiveness study looking at universal screening for sexually transmitted infections versus prophylactic azithromycin (1 g) showed that prophylactic treatment provided a significant cost savings. 31 .g., > 3 hours), or if the estimated blood loss is > 1500 mL, an additional dose of the prophylactic antibiotic may be given 3 to 4 hours after the initial dose.

The American Heart Assocation therefore does not recommend prophylactic antibiotics for patients undergoing genitourinary procedures; this is a change from the 1997 American Heart Assocation guideline. The 2007 guideline identifies 4 conditions that are at highest risk of adverse outcome (Table 3) . For patients with the conditions listed in Table 3 who have an established gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection, or for those who receive antibiotic therapy for another reason (e.g., to prevent wound infection), it may be reasonable that the antibiotic used also be active against enterococci (ampicillin, piperacillin, or vancomycin). The guidelines also suggest that it may be reasonable for patients at high risk of infectious endocarditis who have a known enterococcal urinary tract infection or colonization to receive antibiotic treatment prior to any urinary tract manipulation. A review of this recommendation change has recently been published. 55",
