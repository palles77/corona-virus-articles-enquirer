The swab needs to be inserted through the nose to the pharynx. Testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is most accurate.

Oseltamivir is oral and dosed at 75 mg twice daily for 5 days for treatment. Zanamivir is a nasal spray and has been approved for persons aged 7 years. These agents have been shown to shorten the duration of influenza symptoms but only modestly; if started within 48 hours of symptoms, the duration of the illness may be decreased by approximately 1 day.

Pandemic refers to a new viral type and worldwide spread but not severity.

What was the pandemic of 2009? During the 2009-2010 influenza season, a large change in the H and N structure occurred, leaving much of the population, especially those younger than 65 years old, with inadequate immunity. This new structure was the result of a reassortment of bird, swine, and human influenza strains resulting in an antigenically new H1N1 strain. It appeared to start simultaneously in Southern California and Mexico in the spring of 2009 and spread rapidly worldwide with the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic on June 11, 2009. Young adults and children were particularly affected. In Argentina, for example, pediatric hospitalization rates doubled. Of hospitalized children, 19% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 17% required mechanical ventilation, and 5% died. In the United States, 45% of patients admitted to the hospital were under the age of 18 years. Seventy-three percent of patients had at least one underlying condition including asthma, diabetes, heart, lung and neurologic diseases, and pregnancy.",

The severity has been estimated to be similar to that of the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. Many countries including Australia, Spain, and the United States reported more ICU admissions, patients requiring mechanical ventilation, and deaths. Those admitted to ICUs often had extensive multifocal pneumonias on chest radiograph. In one study of those admitted to the ICU, 36% had pulmonary emboli on chest computed tomography. Early in the pandemic, Spain noted that 91% of the patients admitted to the ICU had primary viral pneumonia, 75% had multiorgan failure, 75% required mechanical ventilation, and 22% needed renal replacement therapy. In the Australia and New Zealand experience, one third of patients receiving mechanical ventilation were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and 21% died. In Canadian experience, 81% of critically ill patients received mechanical ventilation for a median of 12 days. The 28-day mortality of these patients was 14.3%. Lung rescue therapies included neuromuscular blockade (28%), inhaled nitrous oxide (13.7%), high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (11.9%), ECMO (4.2%), and pronepositioning ventilation (3.0%). The 90-day mortality was 17.3%.",

Any patient admitted to the ICU with a respiratory illness during the influenza season should be presumed to have influenza until proved otherwise by nasopharyngeal swab PCR. Patients may be seen with exacerbations of underlying cardiopulmonary diseases, primary viral pneumonia, or secondary bacterial pneumonias. All patients should be given treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor and antibiotics. Antibacterial therapy should be directed primarily against S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and H. influenzae. Possible initial regimens may include ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Once respiratory and blood culture results are known, the empiric antibiotics should be narrowed or stopped.",

This mode of transmission generally requires close contact (3-6 feet) because these larger and heavier respiratory particles quickly fall out of the air. Hand contact with environmental surfaces contaminated with the virus can also transmit influenza when those hands come in contact with mucosal surfaces such as touching the eye, nose, or mouth. Concern has been expressed that influenza may be airborne transmitted by small-particle aerosols, though it is not clear how much this mode of transmission contributes to community spread. For the office and hospital, the CDC recommends standard and droplet precautions as follows: n Placing the patient in a private room. n Wearing a surgical mask when entering the patient room. n Wearing gloves and gowns if you should expect contact with patient's blood, body fluids, or secretions (including respiratory). n If participating in an aerosol-generating procedure such as intubation, extubation, bronchoscopy, or autopsy, a fit-tested N95 respirator or a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) should be worn.
