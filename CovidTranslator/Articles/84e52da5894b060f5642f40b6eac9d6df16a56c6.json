Mounting evidence indicates that the worldwide-distributed prototypic mammarenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a neglected human pathogen of clinical significance. There are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed vaccines and current anti-mammarenavirus therapy is limited to an off-label use of ribavirin that is only partially effective and can cause significant side effects. Therefore, there is an unmet need for novel antiviral drugs to combat LASV. This task would be facilitated by the implementation of high throughput screens (HTS) to identify inhibitors of the activity of the virus ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) responsible for directing virus RNA genome replication and gene transcription. The use of live LASV for this purpose is jeopardized by the requirement of biosafety level 4 (BSL4) containment. We have developed a virus-free cell platform, where expression levels of reporter genes serve as accurate surrogates of vRNP activity, to develop cell-based assays compatible with HTS to identify inhibitors of LASV and LCMV mammarenavirus vRNP activities.",

            "text": "Mammarenaviruses cause chronic infections of rodents with a worldwide distribution and human infections occur through mucosal exposure to aerosols, or by direct contact of abraded skin with infectious materials (Buchmeier et al., 2007) . Several mammarenaviruses cause severe disease in humans and pose an important public health problem in their endemic regions (Bray, 2005; Geisbert and Jahrling, 2004) . Thus, Lassa virus (LASV), a mammarenavirus highly prevalent in West Africa, is estimated to infect several hundred thousand individuals annually resulting in a high number of Lassa fever (LF) cases, a disease associated with high morbidity and significant lethality in patients who develop severe symptoms (Gunther and Lenz, 2004; Richmond and Baglole, 2003) . Increased travelling has resulted in the importation of cases of LF into non-endemic metropolitan areas across the world including the US (Freedman and Woodall, 1999; Isaacson, 2001) . In addition, mounting evidence indicates that the worldwide-distributed mammarenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a neglected human pathogen of clinical relevance (Bonthius, 2009 (Bonthius, , 2012a (Bonthius, , 2012b , which also poses a threat to immune compromised individuals (Macneil et al., 2012; Palacios et al., 2008) . There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed mammarenavirus vaccines and current anti-mammarenavirus therapy is limited to an off-label use of ribavirin that is only partially effective and can cause significant side effects Hadi et al., 2010) . The broad-spectrum inhibitor favipiravir (T-705) (Gowen et al., 2013; Mendenhall et al., 2011a; Safronetz et al., 2015) and the mammarenavirus glycoprotein (GPC)mediated fusion inhibitor ST-193 (Cashman et al., 2011) have shown promising results in animal models of arenaviral hemorrhagic fever (HF) disease. Nevertheless, the development of additional anti-mammarenavirus drugs can facilitate the implementation of combination therapy against LASV and other human pathogenic mammarenaviruses, an approach known to counteract the emergence of drug resistant variants often observed with mono therapy strategies (Domingo, 2006) . Likewise, the identification of novel inhibitors of mammarenavirus multiplication can serve as tool compounds for the generation of new knowledge in virus biology by uncovering previously unexplored pathways and specific host cell factors contributing to different steps of the virus life cycle.",

Each genome segment, large (L) and small (S) uses an ambisense coding strategy to direct the synthesis of two proteins in opposite orientation, separated by a non-coding intergenic region (IGR). The S RNA encodes the viral https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104667 Received 10 September 2019; Received in revised form 22 November 2019; Accepted 26 November 2019 nucleoprotein (NP) and the viral glycoprotein precursor (GPC) whose processing by cellular signal peptidase and Site 1 Protease (S1P) generates a 58-amino acid stable signal peptide (SSP) and the mature virion surface glycoproteins GP1 and GP2 that together with SSP form the GP complex that mediates cell entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The L RNA encodes the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (L polymerase), and the matrix Z protein. Advances in mammarenavirus molecular genetics have opened new approaches for the development of screening strategies to identify inhibitors of mammarenavirus multiplication Emonet et al., 2011a; Miranda et al., 2018; Welch et al., 2016) . However, the use of these approaches with live LASV are complicated by the requirement of biosafety level 4 (BSL4) containment. The viral trans-acting factors (NP and L) and cis-acting regulatory sequences required for the formation of a functional virus ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex responsible for directing viral genome replication and gene transcription of the mammarenavirus genome have been defined (Emonet et al., 2011a; Sarute and Ross, 2017) . We used this knowledge to engineer cell lines constitutively expressing synthetic functional vRNPs for LCMV (LCMV/vRNP) and LASV (LASV/vRNP) encoding reporter genes (LCMV/vRNP: Gaussia luciferase [Gluc] and green fluorescent protein [GFP]; LASV/vRNP: Gluc and ZsGreen [ZsG]) whose expression levels serve as an accurate surrogate of vRNP activity. We used this cell-based, infectious-free, platform to develop a quantitative high-throughput screening (HTS) on a fully automated robotic screening system (Inglese et al., 2006) (Kalypsys) , and used the multiplexed vRNA-cytotoxicity assay to identify inhibitors of LCMV and LASV vRNP activities.",

We confirmed 16 compounds with EC 50 < 10 \u03bcM in the Gluc assay and greater than 10-fold selectivity between Gluc and cytotoxicity assays, in either cell line. These compounds included several known ionophore antibiotics and inhibitors of the mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain (mETC) complex I and III. We selected 11 of the 16 confirmed hits to examine their effects on multiplication of live LCMV in cultured cells. All 11 tested compounds exhibited anti-LCMV activity in the context of a bona fide LCMV infection. Consistent with their identification in the screen as inhibitors of the LCMV and LASV vRNP activities, all tested compounds specifically inhibited the activity of a LCMV minigenome (MG) in a cell-based transfection assay. The mETC complex I and III inhibitors Antimycin A and Mubritinib (TAK165), respectively, exhibited the highest anti-LCMV activity with low (~70 nM) half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) and high (> 700) selectivity index (SI; SI = CC 50 /EC 50 ) values. Our results support the use of LCMV/vRNP and LASV/vRNP cell lines as a reliable platforms for HTS to identify inhibitors of the activity of the vRNP responsible for directing the biosynthetic processes of replication and gene transcription of the viral genome, with the benefit that the infectious-free nature of this platform overcomes the need of BSL4 containment required for handling live LASV.",

            "text": "We aimed to engineer an infectious-free cell platform that accurately recreated RNA replication and gene transcription biosynthetic processes of LASV in infected cells to enable screening protocols to identify inhibitors of LASV vRNP activity without the requirement of BSL4 containment. We first explore the feasibility of this approach using the LCMV system as it would allow us to compare results obtained with the virus-free cell platform and live virus infection in BSL2. We constructed the plasmid hPol1-LCMV/SMG-Gluc/Pur-GFP that directed intracellular synthesis, mediated by the human RNA polymerase I promoter (hPol1), of a LCMV-like vRNA (a.k.a. minigenome-MG) of the S segment (antigenome polarity, cRNA) where the NP ORF was replaced by the Pur resistant gene fused to the N-terminus of GFP (Pur-GFP) and the GPC ORF by the Gluc reporter gene (Fig. 1A) . We transfected HEK293T cells with the hPol1-LCMV/SMG-Gluc/Pur-GFP plasmid together with polymerase II expression pCAGGS plasmids encoding LCMV NP and L, the minimal trans-acting viral factors required for LCMV genome replication and gene expression (Hass et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2000) (Fig. 1A) . At 24 h post-transfection we plated cells into 10-cm dishes at low density and subjected them to selection in the presence of Pur (2.5 \u03bcg/ml) to select cell clones that expressed a functional LCMV vRNP as determined by high levels of GFP (> 95% GFP + cells and > 20,000 fluorescent units over parental control cells) and Gluc (> 100-fold induction over parental control cells) (Fig. 1A) . We used a similar approach to generate the hPol1-LASV/SMG-Gluc/ Zeo-P2A-ZsG construct where Gluc substituted for the GPC ORF, and the NP ORF was replaced for a Zeo-P2A-ZsG (Fig. 1A) . We selected Zeo-P2A-ZsG over the Pur-GFP we used with LCMV, based on evidence supporting the superior performance of Zeocin as selection agent for development of human cell lines (Lanza et al., 2013) , and the stronger mean intensity fluorescence of ZsG compared to GFP. This hPol1-LASV/ SMG-Gluc/Zeo-P2A-ZsG directs intracellular synthesis of an LASV S MG RNA specie of genome polarity where Zeo-P2A-ZsG is in antisense polarity with respect to the hPol1 promoter, which prevented the possibility that the hPol1 could direct the synthesis of RNA species that, despite the lack of capping and polyadenylation, could result in low levels of Zeo-P2A-ZsG expression and introduce a confounding factor during cell line selection. To engineer the cell line expressing the functional LASV vRNP we used commercially available (GenTarget Inc) HEK293 cells stably expressing the monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) and the blasticidin resistant gene (bsr) (HEK293-RFP). This approach facilitates rapid identification of compounds that may significantly interfere with Pol-II-mediated expression and thereby could affect expression of the viral NP and LP with the consequent effect on vRNP activity. ZsG and mRFP have different excitation and emission spectra (Shaner et al., 2005) , and therefore their expression levels in the same sample can be determined without mutual interference. We transfected HEK293-RFP cells with hPol1-LASV/SMG-Gluc/Zeo-P2A-ZsG together with the Pol-II pCAGGS expression vectors for LASV NP and L, and used zeocin treatment (100 \u03bcg/ml) to select cells expressing a functional LASV vRNP as determined by high levels of ZsG (> 95% ZsG + cells and > 15,000 FU over non-expressing vRNP control cells) and Gluc (> 100-fold induction over parental control cells).",

            "text": "To assess the feasibility of using the vRNP-cell lines as platforms to implement HTS to identify inhibitors of LCMV and LASV vRNP genome replication and gene transcription, we evaluated the performance of LCMV/vRNP and LASV/vRNP cell lines in a 96-well plate format assay. For that, we seeded LCMV/vRNP and LASV/vRNP cells in 96-well plates (black with optically clear bottom, Greiner Bio) at different densities and at different post-seeding times treated cells with ribavirin (0-250 \u03bcM), which is known to inhibit both LCMV (Ortiz-Riano et al., 2014) and LASV multiplication in a dose-dependent manner. At different times (12, 24 and 48 h) post-treatment with ribavirin, we determined expression levels of Gluc in tissue culture supernatants and GFP (LCMV/vRNP) or ZsG (LASV/vRNP) in cells. We used DAPI staining to estimate cell biomass and avoid differences in cell numbers as confounding factor of values of vRNP activity. We observed Cubitt, et al. Antiviral Research 173 (2020) 104667 the expected dose-dependent inhibitory activity of ribavirin on LCMV and LASV vRNP-directed expression of both Gluc and GFP (LCMV) or ZsG (LASV). We obtained optimal results for both LCMV/vRNP and LASV/vRNP cells lines (14 replicates/condition) using the following conditions: 1) seeding 4x10 4 cells/well, 2) compound (ribavirin) addition at 8 h after cell seeding, and 3) assay read out at 48 h after starting ribavirin treatment. The assay had a signal to background ratio (S/ B) > 100 for Gluc and > 15 for GFP (LCMV) or ZsG (LASV) readouts, as determined by comparing signals obtained with vRNP-expressing lines and control cells lacking the corresponding vRNP. We observed an inhibition > 99% of LCMV and LASV vRNP activities at 250 \u03bcM ribavirin and selected this ribavirin concentration to generate the minimal signal of the assay. To evaluate the assay signal dynamic range and data variation associated with sample measurement we determined the Z\u2032 factor values for Gluc and ZsG-based readouts of the LASV vRNP activity in ribavirin-treated LASV/vRNP cells. We used as maximal (Max) and minimal (Min) reporter signals the values obtained at 0 and 50 or 250 \u03bcM ribavirin, respectively, after subtracting background signals (Fig. 2E) . Under the optimized assay conditions we consistently observed a Z' \u2265 0.5 for Gluc and ZsG-based readouts in the presence of 50 or 250 \u03bcM ribavirin, these Z' factor values are compatible with the assay being adapted to HTS (Iversen et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 1999) . At the highest concentration tested (250 \u03bcM), ribavirin had a minimal effect on cell viability, which prevented us from assessing the response of our cell-based assay to compound induced toxicity. To address this issue, we examined the dose-dependent effect of DMSO on cell viability and vRNP-directed reporter gene expression. Determining the DMSO tolerance of our assay was also critically important as primary screens will be done at single dose (10 \u03bcM) compound prepared in DMSO, which would require our assay to be compatible with the compound contributed % of DMSO in the final volume. We found that at concentrations \u22640.5% DMSO did not have any significant effect on the viability of LCMV/vRNP or LASV/vRNP cell lines, whereas subsequent increases in the % of DMSO resulted in dose-dependent cell toxicity as determined by the CellTiter-Fluor cell viability assay, which correlated with reduced levels of vRNP directed expression of GFP (LCMV/vRNP) or ZsG (LASV/vRNP) and Gluc (both LCMV/vRNP and LASV/vRNP).",

These platforms are based on the generation of human HEK293 cell lines stably expressing LCMV and LASV trans-acting factors, NP and L, required for the formation of a functional vRNP together with a virus-like RNA (MG) encoding for reporter genes whose expression levels serve as accurate surrogates of the vRNP activity. Generation of the LCMV/vRNP and LASV/vRNP cell lines was facilitated by the MG expressing of a fusion gene between a drug resistant gene and the reporter gene. The dynamic range and reproducibility of vRNP-directed reporter gene expression in response to known inhibitors of LCMV and LASV RNA synthesis validated the use of the LCMV/vRNP and LASV/vRNP cell lines for the implementation of HTS approaches to identify inhibitors of LCMV and LASV vRNP activities. Our central goal was to generate an infectious-free cell system to identify compounds that modulate LASV RNA synthesis mediated by an intracellularly reconstituted functional vRNP without the need of BSL4 containment. These compounds would include candidate antiviral drugs and tool compounds for the investigation of the mechanisms regulating vRNPdirected LASV RNA synthesis. To examine the feasibility of this approach we first generated the LCMV/vRNP cell line and confirmed it faithfully recreated the biosynthetic features of the vRNP observed in the context of LCMV-infected cells.",

Accordingly, the activity of the mammarenavirus vRNP likely involves viral protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, as well as the contribution of host cell factors. Compounds that target the function of viral proteins, and their interactions, required for vRNP activity are expected to offer specificity, but inhibitor-escape mutants have been isolated for virtually any virus for which a specific inhibitor has been developed, which poses a general problem in antiviral therapy (Domingo, 2003) . Combination therapy has proven effective to reduce and delay the selection of viral escape mutants, but does not entirely solve this problem (Domingo, 2003) . In contrast, intra-host virus evolution is unlikely to result in viral variants able to escape from inhibitors that disrupt cellular functions required for vRNP activity. Moreover, vRNP of related viruses, like LCMV and LASV, are likely to rely on the same host cell factors for their activities, thus compounds targeting these host cell factors provide an opportunity for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics. Targeting host cell factors poses the concern of drug-associated toxicity. However, it should be noted that treatment of acute arenaviral HF disease would be of relatively short duration, and clinical benefits may easily surpass potential short -term duration side effects. It should be also noted that compounds that inhibit LASV and LCMV via the same mechanism of action can be used in studies using the well-established mouse model of LCMV infection to gain valuable information to design more effectively studies in animal models of LASV infection, which should minimize the cost and complex logistic of the use of BSL4 containment required to handle live forms of LASV.",

In addition, despite their phylogenetic proximity, LCMV and LASV exhibit a significant degree of genetic divergence and have multiple amino acid differences in their NP and L polymerase proteins.

            "text": "Mubritinib has been recently identified as a novel mETC complex I inhibitor (Baccelli IG et al., 2019) , which may have contributed to its anti-LCMV activity. Moreover, rotenone, another validated mETC complex I inhibitor (Majander et al., 1996) , exhibited also a potent (EC 50 = 0.66 \u03bcM; SI > 75) anti-LCMV activity. Impaired mETC function can suppress autophagy , which has been shown to cause reduced production of infectious progeny of the mammarenavirus LASV (Baillet et al., 2019) . De novo pyrimidine biosynthesis has been also linked to mETC activity via dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) (Loffler et al., 1997) , and DHODH inhibitors have been shown to be potent broad-spectrum antivirals (Hoffmann et al., 2011) . Clinical implementation of inhibitors of mETC function as antiviral agents can raise objections related to their expected potential toxicity. However, the mETC complex I inhibitor biguanide metformin is a widely prescribed antihyperglycaemic for Type II diabetes that has a good safety profile (Bridges et al., 2014) . The Na + and K + ionophore antibiotics narasin and valinomycin, respectively, exhibited also strong inhibitory effect on LCMV and LASV vRNP activity. Narasin has been shown to exert antiviral activity against dengue virus (Low et al., 2011) , whereas valinomycin was identified as a potent hit in a cell-based screen to identify effective antivirals against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Wu et al., 2004) .",

We used these cell lines for the identification of inhibitors of LCMV and LASV RNA genome replication and gene transcription using HTS approaches. The infectivity-free feature of our LASV vRNP-expressing cell line overcomes the need of BSL4 facilities currently required to handle infectious LASV, which has the potential to accelerate development of antivirals against LASV. Using these vRNP-expressing cell lines in drug repurposing screens we identified 16 compounds that inhibited LCMV and LASV vRNP activity. Importantly, a subset of 11 tested compounds inhibited multiplication of live LCMV in cultured cells. Existing knowledge about the targets of these antiviral compounds would suggest the mETC as a potential target for therapeutics against mammarenaviruses, as well as the merits of exploring ionophore-based compounds as potential antivirals against LASV. Future studies, beyond the scope of the present paper, will examine whether newly identified compounds with the ability to inhibit LCMV and LASV vRNP activity are also active against HF-causing New World arenavirus such as Junin virus, as well as the antiviral activity of these compounds in animal models of mammarenavirus infection.",
