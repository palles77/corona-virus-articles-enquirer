These selfassembly systems may also be used in understanding the molecular and structural biology which can inspire the design and synthesis of increasingly complex biomaterials. Specifically, use of these building blocks to investigate protein folding and misfolding has been of particular value since it can provide tremendous insights into peptide aggregation related to a variety of protein misfolding diseases, or amyloid diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, type-II diabetes). Herein, the self-assembly of TK9, a 9 residue peptide of the extra membrane C-terminal tail of the SARS Corona virus envelope, and its variants were characterized through biophysical, spectroscopic and simulated studies, and it was confirmed that the structure of these peptides influence their aggregation propensity, hence, mimicking amyloid proteins. TK9, which forms a beta-sheet rich fibril, contains a key sequence motif that may be critical for beta-sheet formation, thus making it an interesting system to study amyloid fibrillation. TK9 aggregates were further examined through simulations to evaluate the possible intra-and inter peptide interactions at the molecular level. These self-assembly peptides can also serve as amyloid inhibitors through hydrophobic and electrophilic recognition interactions. Our results show that TK9 inhibits the fibrillation of hIAPP, a 37 amino acid peptide implicated in the pathology of type-II diabetes. Thus, biophysical and NMR experimental results have revealed a molecular level understanding of peptide folding events, as well as the inhibition of amyloid-protein aggregation are reported.",

            "text": "The formation of nanostructures through molecular self-assembly has been demonstrated to be a ubiquitous process in nature as seen by organic molecules (polymers), proteins, peptides and DNA. These nanostructures have been characterized by their highly ordered aggregate formation through non-covalent interactions (e.g., electrostatic, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals, and aromatic \u03c0-stacking and cation-\u03c0). The emerging field of nanotechnology has exploited self-assembly systems due to the key advantage that their physical, chemical, optoelectronic, magnetic and mechanical properties are tunable via control of their size and shape. 1 Interestingly, all the aforementioned non-covalent forces are quite weak in nature, individually, but cumulatively they support the self-organization of simple units into complicated and controlled structures. 2 Despite tremendous research efforts, the relative involvement of these forces in self-assembly processes is yet to be more clearly understood. Recently, substantial attention has been intended for the rational design and structural analysis of peptide based self-assembly due to their widespread diversity in chemical, structural and functional aspects. 1, 3 Furthermore, the complex nature of biomolecules limits the comprehensive understanding of the factors controlling the selfassembling properties. To examine this in more detail, short peptides or peptide fragments can be constructed relatively quickly and may serve as the competent building blocks for self-assembled systems thus avoiding the complexities of forming and studying large protein structures. . Self-assembled peptide systems have also been utilized in studying protein-folding events in order to provide insight into the thermodynamic properties of protein folding and misfolding. These investigations have also helped gain information about specific structural motifs adopted by specific amino acid sequences and combinations which may be responsible for protein misfolding and amyloid formation. Therefore, studying the selfassembly of peptides has been utilized as an important tool for analyzing the local structure (e.g., secondary structure) of peptide fragments in the context of the global protein structure. 4 These peptide nanostructures are generally formed from beta (\u03b2)-sheet motifs, although a few helical-based assemblies have also been reported. 5, 6 Based on various structural, chemical and physical properties they are classified according to the following categories: a) lipid-like peptides, b) surfactant peptides, c) amphiphilic peptides, d) aromatic di-peptide motifs, e) cyclodextrin-based polyionic amino acids from known self assembled protein, e) cyclic peptides and f) arbitrarily chosen peptide sequence based on amino acid properties. 7 The unique supramolecular assemblies can be readily tuned by modifying structural properties such as changing the amino acid sequence or conjugating chemical groups or by varying experimental parameters such as pH or solvent. Peptide nanostructures have also been utilized in vast miscellaneous fields, from antibacterial agents to molecular electronics with a great achievement and therefore have become of great interest to study. 8, 9 Importantly, investigating self-assembly systems at the molecular level have been of particular value in studying the complex phenomena behind the aggregation of amyloid proteins and aggregation of other proteins related to fatal protein conformational disorders. 10 It has been found that amyloid-related diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease (AD), Prion diseases, Type II diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease) are connected by the aggregation of relatively unstructured monomers into a \u03b2-sheet rich fibrillar aggregates. 11, 12 In spite of the diversity in sequence homology, the fibrillar network have similar morphologies; however, the precise biochemical/biophysical pathways and mechanism of protein fibrillation still remain elusive. Self-assembled short peptides have the potential to serve as model systems to studying amyloid aggregation by simplifying the study of amyloidosis as seen in a study by Lynn and co-workers. 13 This can help probe specific protein-protein interactions between the small peptide assemblies and translate this information to elucidating the aggregation properties of the native peptide/protein. Furthermore, small peptide fragments from amyloid proteins (KLVFF in amyloid-\u03b2 and NFGAIL in hIAPP) have demonstrated to have inhibitory properties, thus modifying or in some cases halting the aggregation pathway. Therefore, studying self-assembled peptide fragments may also help potentially uncover possible motifs that may be utilized for amyloid inhibition and eventually therapeutic applications.",

            "text": "In the present study, we have investigated and analyzed the self assembly of a 9 residue peptide (hereafter denoted as TK9) and its derivatives taken from the sequence of the carboxyl terminal (55-63) of SARS Corona Virus Envelope protein (Scheme 1). 14 Generally, corona viruses are enveloped and this enveloped (E) region may be the main culprit in causing virulence related to various respiratory diseases such as, common colds, bronchiolitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in humans and other. 15 The E regions are peptide fragments consisting of 76-108 amino acids and composed of a flexible region at both N-and C-terminals and \u03b1-helical transmembrane (TM) region. 16 This region has shown to adopt mainly helical structure in the presence of SDS micelles, suggesting that a membrane surface may influence its secondary structure. 16 Upon mutation of the 56 VYVY 59 region of the C-terminal tail in the SARS Corona virus, the secondary structure has changed to a more discrete \u03b2-structure. 16 To gain further insight, whether the short peptide, TK9 and its variants have a selfassembling tendency, we carried out detailed biophysical and high resolution analyses of TK9. These data demonstrated that TK9 self assembles and forms a \u03b2-sheet secondary structure in solution. To support our experimental findings and also to extract out the atomic level interactions acting as a driving force for this self-assembly process we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Furthermore, we also studied the ability of TK9 to inhibit the aggregation of a 37-residue human islet amyloid polypeptide protein (hIAPP) in order to obtain possible structural motifs that may be beneficial for the mitigation of hIAPP aggregation. Previous studies have shown that unstructured hIAPP monomers aggregate to form toxic intermediates and amyloid fibers that composed of \u03b2-sheet peptide structures that are implicated in type II diabetes. Therefore, there is considerable current interest in developing compounds to inhibit hIAPP aggregation and islet cell toxicity. In this context, the amyloid-inhibiting ability of TK9 could be useful and aid in the development of potent amyloid inhibitors.",

This region has been predicted to be responsible for directing the protein to the Golgi region. 16, 30, 31 It should be mentioned that this type of motif remains conserved in other corona viruses and is abundantly expressed in infected cells and may also be critically involved in viral protein assembly. 32, 33 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy investigations have also shown that this portion of the protein can intrinsically adopt both a random coil and \u03b2-sheet conformation in the absence of a membrane environment. 30 The folding domain (\u03b2-structured region), which contains the sequence of TVYVYSRVK and its fragments (Scheme 1B) contain residues and sequences similar to those of amyloid proteins. This has led to the hypothesis that TK9 may have similar properties to the folding domains of amyloid proteins (e.g., amyloid-\u03b2), where certain residue regions have limited water solubility and adopt a \u03b2-sheet structure and may aggregate to form amyloid-like fibrillar species. This observation has made TK9 and its derivatives insightful nanostructure systems to study protein assembly and mechanism of folding. 34 Specifically, residues I46 -V62 contain branched and bulky side chains which may favor the formation of \u03b2-sheet structures. 35 The first five resides of TK9 and TY5 (TVYVY) (Scheme 1C) also contain a peptide motif demonstrated to form amyloid-like fibrils; therefore, this short peptide fragment and its derivatives namely, TY5, YR5 and SK4 (Scheme 1C) were chosen as model systems to give possible insights into amyloid folding events.",

It is seen that freshly prepared TK9 or its analogues, TY5, YR5 and SK4 (Scheme 1C) show a narrow size distribution pattern with a hydrodynamic diameter of ~ 27 nm ( Figure 1A and Figure S4 ). The narrow distribution confirms that the peptides are monomer in freshly dissolved solution at early time points. However, with increasing the incubation time period for TK9, TY5 and YR5, the size distribution profile became wider, which accounts for the presence of polymeric subunits in solution ( Figure  S4 ). After 15-days of incubation, clear distinction in the hydrodynamic diameters were observed for the peptides. TK9 and TY5 showed the highest change in hydrodynamic diameter, whereas YR5 showed a moderate change in size distribution only after 25 days of incubation ( Figure S4 ). On the other hand, SK4 showed a negligible amount of change in hydrodynamic diameter within a period of 25 days of incubation, which suggests its lower aggregating propensity. This trend pointed out that aromatic amino acids (Tyr) of these peptides may contribute significantly to the shape and size of their nanostructure assemblies and that polar amino acids may not directly influence their size. Overall, our DLS results proved a similar aggregation behavior of the parent peptide TK9 and its N-terminal fragments TY5 and YR5 can be seen after 25 days of incubation.",

Interestingly, after 15 days of incubation, samples containing TK9 and TY5 showed distinct \u03b2-sheet type CD spectral signature consisting of positive maximum at 200 nm and a negative maximum at 215 nm due to n\u03c0* and \u03c0\u03c0* transition ( Figure 1B and 1C) . In contrary, the CD spectrum of YR5 showed two peaks, one at ~ 198 nm and another broad peak at ~ 215 nm ( Figure 1D ). Similarly, SK4 showed a large broadening of peaks ( Figure  1E ). This result clearly signifies that both YR5 and SK4 are highly dynamic in nature and there may be conformational exchange between random coils to \u03b2-sheet in a dynamic state ( Figure 1D-E) .

TEM data revealed that freshly prepared TK9 did not show any measureable structure (data not shown), which is in very good agreement with the CD data ( Figure 1B) . However, TEM analysis of the sample containing TK9 alone with 10 days of incubation displayed a dense fibrillar network which has slight amorphousity and unbranched characteristics (Figure 2A and inset, respectively), suggesting that the peptide region are able to form \u03b2-sheet morphology, which could be in good agreement with the TEM images of \u03b2-sheet forming amyloid fibrils originated from either A\u03b2 or hIAPP. 37 This structure also emphasized that the rate of nucleation for the \u03b2-sheet formation could be slower due to presence of two positive charge residues, Arg7 and Lys9 at the C-terminal of the peptide sequence. However, the effect of fibrillation was more pronounced in case of TY5 peptide sequence consisting beta branched amino acids such as Thr1-Val2-Tyr3-Val4-Tyr5 residues. In addition, these residues may be more prone to form a plane of \u03b2-sheet structures ( Figure 2B ). Hence, TY5 showed distinct nano-rod type of morphology ( Figure 2B ) after 25 days of static incubation at 37 \u00b0C. In contrast, YR5 and SK4 did not show any defined nanostructure by TEM (data not shown), which could be attributed to the sole presence of charged residues at the Cterminal of TK9 sequence which did not allows the peptides to self assemble.",

This enhancement was attributed to the change in the local environment of the fluorophore from a hydrophilic to a more hydrophobic environment. Initially, the Tyr residues were randomly oriented in solution where solvent molecule could easily quench their fluorescence intensity. However, the fluorescence emission maxima increased almost 4 times for TK9 and TY5 from 5 days of incubation time to 25 days of incubation time ( Figure 3A ). In contrast, the emission maxima of YR5 increased much less compared to that of TK9 ( Figure 3A) .

The freshly dissolved TK9, incubated with ThT demonstrated very low fluorescence intensity. However as TK9 allowed to self assemble for 16-days, a greater extent of fluorescence intensity of ThT at approx. 490 nm was displayed, indicative of the presence of a \u03b2-sheet rich species. This result further confirms that the aggregation propensity of TK9 in solution increases over time. Collectively, these results suggest that the non-covalent \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction between the Tyr residues in the supramolecular structures of the aggregated states create a hydrophobic environment (\u03b2sheet structure) where the entrance of water molecule is restricted and hence enhances the fluorescence emission maxima and interacts with the ThT dye.",

While freshly prepared peptides exhibited well-dispersed narrow peaks from amide protons, line broadening was observed with time of incubation ( Figure 4A-4D) . TK9 and TY5 showed the highest amount of line broadening with respect to time, whereas SK4 showed the least line broadening ( Figure 4E ). The observed line broadening in NMR spectra due to the chemical exchange process, occurring in millisecond to microsecond time scale can be attributed to peptide aggregation, which could result in the formation of high molecular weight assemblies. This effect was further confirmed by proton relaxation studies. 1 H NMR relaxation studies are used extensively as a sensitive probe to investigate the weak interactions (dissociation constant, K d ~ \u03bcM to mM range) in peptide oligomerization. 39 ",

            "text": "The above experimental result motivated us to determine the mechanism of aggregation of a small peptide, TK9. Interestingly, among the nine amino acid residues, there are two aromatic amino acid residues, Tyr, three hydrophobic Val residues, two positive charge Lys and Arg and two \u03b2-branched amino acid residues, Thr and Ser. The NMR derived extended conformation of TK9 ( Figure S6C ) was used as an initial structure for the coarse grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. It is noteworthy to mention that the selfassembly of a short peptide occurs at a \u03bcs time scale, and hence it is a time consuming process to carry out all atom MD simulation. 40 To overcome this problem, coarse-grained MD simulation was adopted to study the aggregation of TK9 with twenty TK9 peptide chains. Figure S2 summarizes the stages of aggregation of TK9. Interestingly, the scattered monomers started self-assembling after 27 ns of simulation and the cluster size was increasing as the time progressed. Finally, after 999 ns of simulation, fifteen out of twenty TK9 peptide chains were self-assembled to form the TK9 aggregate ( Figure S2 ). The remaining five TK9 monomers were still scattered after 1 \u03bcs of simulation. Next, we wanted to understand the driving force of the aggregation for TK9. The secondary structure analysis of the assembled as well as the scattered molecules were performed using the Stride web interface. 41 Interestingly, we found that the 60% of conformation of assembled peptide possess a beta turn and more than 35% of conformation exists as random coil (Table S3 ). Closer inspection indicated that the self-assembly of TK9 ( Figure 6 ) was stabilized by a variety of interactions, such as H-bonding, electrostatic, \u03c0-cation and van der Waals. The Cterminal positively charged Lys9 residue of TK9 contributed for a H-bonding interaction with Thr1 and with Ser6. In addition, H-bonding contributions were also observed between Thr1-Ser6, Tyr3-Tyr5, Val4-Tyr5, Val2-Val4 and Thr1-Thr1 of TK9 in an assembled state. Apart from the H-bonding interactions between two self-assembled monomers, polar residues such as Arg7 and Lys9 formed numerous intermolecular salt bridge interactions (Table S4) . Hydrophobic contacts were also observed between Val2-Tyr3, Val4-Tyr3, TYR5-Val4, Val2-Val4, Val2-Tyr5 and Tyr3-Val8, which may also play an important role in the aggregated form of TK9 ( Figure 6 ). Interestingly, Tyr3-Tyr3, Tyr5-Tyr5 and Tyr3-Tyr5 aromatic interactions between two monomers of TK9 aggregates were crucial for stabilization. This result was in very good agreement with the Tyr fluorescence intensity enhancement in the aggregated state ( Figure 6 ). A few cation-\u03c0 interactions between Tyr3-Arg7, Tyr5-Arg7 and Tyr5-Arg9 were also observed in the fibrillar TK9 (Table S5) .",

The SASA values of each residue of TK9 aggregate as well as in the scattered monomers after 1 \u03bcs of simulation were calculated ( Figure 7) and it was clear that the overall SASA values for all the residues in the cluster or aggregated form was lower, whereas, the same amino acid residues in the scattered peptides (monomer) were much higher. The standard deviation of SASA values of each residue of scattered peptides was less compared to that of aggregated peptides. This behavior could be due to folded conformation in the aggregated form and hence they were less accessible to the solvent. On the other hand, the short peptide TK9 is highly dynamic in nature and therefore, the peptide is more solvent exposed in the unfolded form. Interestingly, the C-terminal residues, Arg7, Val8 and Lys9 showed comparably higher SASA values both in the scattered as well as in the aggregated form ( Figure 7 ). Taken together, the central stabilization of the assembly of TK9 was due to the strong van der Waals interactions between hydrophobic Val residues as well as between aromatic Tyr residues. In comparison, the Arg7 and Lys9 residues of TK9 aggregates were pointing towards the solvent to form H-bond with the solvent water molecules.",

Both the receptor, hIAPP, as well as the ligand, TK9, are low-molecular weight molecules; therefore, no STD signals from TK9 in the presence of hIAPP monomers were observed due to the fast tumbling of TK9. However, if hIAPP fibrillizes, it should be possible to transfer the magnetization from the large-size hIAPP fibrils to TK9 peptide in STD experiments. But, the fact that we did not observe STD signal within a period of 12 hours indicates that hIAPP did not exist in fibrillar form ( Figure 8C ), as hIAPP (in the absence of TK9) completely fibrilizes within 3 hours at the same condition as seen by the ThT assay ( Figure 8C ). In addition, when TK9 monomers were incubated with hIAPP fibrils, a pronounced STD signal was observed from aromatic as well as aliphatic amino acid residues, indicating that the aromatic and methyl protons are responsible for interacting with fibrillar hIAPP.

TK9 and TY5 both contain branched, bulky amino acids and a specific sequence (VxVx, Scheme 1) that has been shown to be prone to amyloid-like aggregation. 53 Over time, TK9 spontaneously aggregated in aqueous solution as seen by DLS (Figure 1 ) to adopt rod-like fibrillar morphology, confirmed by microscopic studies (Figure 2) . Interestingly, the aggregation was \u03b2-sheet rich, examined by the increase in ThT fluorescence ( Figure 3 ). All four peptides adopt a random coil monomeric conformation at early time points; however, CD experiments confirmed that TK9 and TY5 form into a \u03b2-sheet containing fibrillar species after incubation over days ( Figure 1B and 1C ). In addition, because of the presence of the \"amyloid aggregation-prone\" sequence motif, a further explanation for the aggregation propensity of TK9 and TY5 may be the increase in hydrophobic and aromatic residues, which may favor hydrophobic contacts and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions as well as undergo a transition to \u03b2-sheet during self-assembly more readily than peptides with aliphatic residues. 53 Structurally different, YR5 and SK4, which do not contain the aggregation-prone sequence, did not show this transition to \u03b2-sheet nor did they show an enhanced ThT fluorescence, suggesting an ill-defined secondary structure. The distribution profile of the peptides is also varied upon aggregation as suggested by the DLS studies ( Figure 1A ). As the peptides were incubated, the size of the species increased, which may be attributed to the fibril-like aggregates formed in the case of TK9 and TY5. The \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions could be the governing factor for the folding of the peptide into supramolecular assemblies as seen by Tyr fluorescence experiments ( Figure 3 ). As TK9 is allowed to self-assemble, it forms a hydrophobic core, which does not allow for interactions with water, and thus an enhancement in the Tyr fluorescence signal by neighboring Tyr residues. Coarse grain MD simulation confirms that the self-assembled oligomer of TK9 is stabilized by hydrophobic amino acid residues such as, Tyr and Val from individual monomers to form a hydrophobic hub and all the charge residues such as Arg7 and Lys9 are exposed to water ( Figure 6 ). In contrary, the solvent quenches the fluorescence intensity of TK9 or TY5 monomer ( Figure  3 ). However, a well-defined secondary structure of YR5, the central region of TK9, was not observed. In order to probe the mechanistic insights of self-assembly of a short peptide at an atomic resolution, NMR spectroscopy was carried out.",

In 1 H NMR spectra, amide resonances are observed for all of the peptides at initial time points. As the peptides are allowed to self-assemble, significant line broadening is visible for TK9 and TY5, whereas a lesser broadening is seen for YR5 and SK4 over the time course (Figure 4 ). The line broadening observed for TK9 or TY5 peptides confirms that there is a conformational exchange between several states that occur at the millisecond to microsecond time scale. This dynamic behavior may further confirm an aggregation process occurring in solution, specifically the formation of high molecular weight assemblies that tumble slowly in NMR time scale, which gave rise to an increased rotational correlation time ( Figure 5 ). The TOCSY and ROSEY data, taken of freshly prepared monomers, show no medium or long range cross peaks (or ROEs), confirming the absence of a well-defined secondary structure (possibly random coil) prior to incubation ( Figure S6 ).",

Investigations of the interaction between amyloid proteins and other biologically relevant proteins have been of great interest. Specifically, reports regarding the interaction of co-secreted proteins, hIAPP and insulin, has shed light into the involvement of a protein on amyloid formation. 54, 55 Aforementioned, small peptide sequence from the native protein have been utilized in the design of amyloid inhibitors due to their ability to contain self-recognition motifs which can interact with the target protein through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and prevent polymerization to fibrils. 50, 56, 57 In order to study this, we tested the inhibitory activity of TK9 against hIAPP, an amyloid protein suggested to be a pathological feature of type-2 diabetes. Our experimental results indicate that the amyloid-inhibition properties of TK9 monomers are concentration dependent as shown in Figure 8 . This observation is similar to that shown for amyloid-inhibiting properties of a 9-residue peptide, NK9 (or 45 NIVNVSLVK 53 ) adopted from SARS CoV E-protein, against the fibrillation of insulin. 58 Interestingly, TK9 monomers are able to modify the aggregation kinetics of hIAPP and completely inhibit the fibril formation upon incubation with excess amount of a TK9. This result was further verified by STD NMR experiments, which showed that upon incubation of hIAPP monomers with excess TK9 monomers, no pronounced STD effect was observed indicating the presence of a small, insufficient amount of hIAPP fibers. On the other hand, when TK9 monomers are present in a solution along with hIAPP fibrils, a strong STD signal was observed, confirming an interaction between the two peptides.",

Herein, the aggregation properties of TK9 and its variants were characterized through biophysical, spectroscopic and simulated studies, and it was confirmed that the structure of these peptides influence their aggregation propensity and fibrillar morphology. TK9 underwent a transition to a more \u03b2-sheet rich structure, which adopted a fibril-like shape. These aggregates were further investigated through simulations to understand more clearly the possible intra-and inter peptide interactions at the molecular level. As described here, self-assembly peptides may also be useful templates for designing amyloid inhibitor. These self-assembly systems may also be used in understanding the molecular and structural biology which will inspire the design and synthesis of increasingly complex self assembled biomaterials for biomedicine. Furthermore, investigations to probe the structural characteristics of these peptides in the presence of membrane can also be of great value since the amyloid beta or hIAPP protein interacts with membrane before going to fibrillation.
