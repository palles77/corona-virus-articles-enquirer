Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is an effective method to inactivate airborne microorganisms. The present study models and compares the inactivation performance of three UV sources in the UVGI for aerosolized Escherichia coli. Inactivation efficiency of 0.5, 2.2 and 3.1 logarithmic order was obtained at an exposure UV dose of 370 J/m 3 under UVA (365 nm), UVC (254 nm) and UVD (185 nm) sources, respectively. A Beer-Lambert law-based model was developed and validated to compare the inactivation performances of the UV sources, and modeling enabled prediction of inactivation efficiency and analysis of the sensitivity of several parameters. Low influent E. coli concentrations and high UV doses resulted in high energy consumption (EC). The change in airborne endotoxin concentration during UV inactivation was analyzed, and UVC and UVA irradiation showed no marked effect on endotoxin degradation. By contrast, both free and bound endotoxins could be removed by UVD treatment, which is attributed to the ozone generated by the UVD source. The results of this study can provide a better understanding of the air disinfection and airborne endotoxin removal processes.",

Higher UV sensitivity was observed at higher relative humidity according to Walker's study on MS2 Bacteriophage (Walker and Ko, 2007) . Other than the species of microorganism and relative humidity (Xu et al., 2005) , UV wavelength is also an important parameter determining the UV inactivation efficiency of bacterial aerosol. Maximum effectiveness is usually observed at around 254 nm (UVC) (Koller, 1952 ) and many studies have been conducted on the inactivation of airborne microorganisms by using UVC radiation. Inactivation performance under other UV wavelengths has also been explored. Kim and Jang (2018) , for example, investigated several photocatalytic reactions by UVD (185 nm) with short irradiation times to inactivate airborne MS2 viruses. Araud et al. (Araud et al., 2018) also investigated the inactivation mechanisms of viruses via solar UVA and visible light. However, the inactivation performance of different UV sources, especially UVD, which can damage microorganisms by producing ozone in addition to UV irradiation, has rarely been compared. In addition, few studies have reported the energy efficiency of UVGI devices, which is also a factor to consider when choosing a UV source with which to conduct inactivation.",

Utilization of the Chick-Watson model (Ryan et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2003; Kowalski and William, 2000) is the standard method for modeling the response of microorganisms to UVGI. In some cases, the two-stage curve (Noakes et al., 2015) , such as Rennecker-Marinasis model (Crittenden et al., 2011) and Collins-Selleck model (Collins and Selleck, 1971) , were used to describe the unusually high resistance of microorganisms to irradiation because many microbial decay curves exhibit a decay curve shoulder (time-delayed response) when exposed to UVGI. Most of the previous models were kinetic fitting of inactivation efficiency, while the present work takes mechanism of photoreaction into account, providing more insight into the process of UV inactivating bacteria.",

The generally accepted mechanism for this process is that UV irradiation inactivates bacteria by damaging their DNA, thereby preventing microorganisms from replicating and multiplying. While the damage to DNA molecules brought about by UVA irradiation (Tang and Guo, 2005) is far less than that brought about by UVC, UVA still confers slight damage to the B-form backbone of bacterial DNA by cutting off phosphodiester bonds and disrupting the main spatial structure of DNA as well as affecting the thymine groups.

Inactivation efficiency of 0.5, 2.2 and 3.1 logarithmic order was obtained at an exposure UV dose of 370 J/m 3 under UVA, UVC and UVD treatment, respectively. UVD and UVC were significantly more effective than UVA for inactivating bacteria. Modeling enabled prediction of inactivation efficiencies and analysis of the parameters that may affect inactivation constant k. Energy utilization efficiency was also analyzed by measuring E values. High EC was generally required in the case of relatively low influent E. coli concentrations and high UV doses, especially for the UVA inactivation process.",

            "text": "Changes in airborne endotoxin concentration during UV inactivation were measured in this work. Whereas UVC and UVA showed no effect on endotoxin degradation, both free and bound endotoxins could be removed by UVD treatment, which was attributed to the ozone generated by the UVD source during irradiation. The ratio of free endotoxins first increased then decreased with time, indicating a possible release or transformation from bound to free endotoxins during UV irradiation.",
