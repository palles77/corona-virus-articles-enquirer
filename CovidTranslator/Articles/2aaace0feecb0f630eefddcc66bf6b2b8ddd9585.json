Posttravel assessment for returning travelers xix PREFACE retiring or has left the field, the need for expertise remains equally great for several reasons. The first reason has been noted and includes the incredible growth of travel in a continually shrinking world. Any clinician who sees patients in a travel medicine context is aware of the vast diversity of travelers and the reasons for their trips. The second reason has been an AIDS pandemic that affects large parts of the world where HIV has a complex interaction with an environment of multiple tropical pathogens. Those of us at the level of medical student education have also seen a more subtle yet rapid change: the current generation of students has a far different perception of the world than the one in which we grew up professionally. It is a world contracted by the Internet and by rapid transit times between continents. Students have an appreciation of medicine as a universal language-one that can influence the course of individual disease and public health almost anywhere and at any time. If nineteenth-and twentieth-century missionary activity or global warfare underscored the importance of understanding complex tropical diseases, the need for understanding is now also driven by a global sense of citizenship, social justice, and responsibility.",

Some medical educators consider 1-or 2-month rotations in Africa, Asia, or Latin America to be just ''safari medicine'' unless there is a long-term commitment on the part of the student or resident. This attitude simply misses the point. Would one say the same about a 6-week rotation in a cardiac intensive care unit? Does this 6-week experience merely serve to make the resident a ''cardiac dilettante''? For another of us (D.R.H.), a month-long medical service trip to Guatemala in 1968 led to a profound change in world view and to a commitment to a career in infectious disease, travel, and tropical medicine. The young trainees who seek such experiences are very much in need of advocates within the medical school and residency curriculum committees on which we who are established in our careers may serve. That being the case, we must set the standard in our professional schools for what is taught in the classroom and on the wards, and what constitutes a valid clinical experience abroad.
