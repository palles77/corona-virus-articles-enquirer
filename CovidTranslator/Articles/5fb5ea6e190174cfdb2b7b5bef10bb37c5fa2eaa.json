Noroviruses are small, round, non-enveloped viruses, with a 25-40 nm diameter and have a positivesense, single-stranded RNA genome with three open reading frames (ORF). The non-structural proteins, including the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the single capsid protein (VP1) and the minor structural protein are encoded by ORF1, 2 and 3, respectively (Green, 2007) . Ninety dimers of VP1 form the capsid which presents an icosahedral symmetry under electron microscopy (EM). Capsid protein VP1 has a molecular weight of around 55-60 kDa and is organised into two domains: a shell (S) domain (N-terminal part of VP1) and a protruding (P) domain (C-terminal part of VP1) (Prasad et al., 1999) . The P domain supports receptor recognition and immunogenic functions (Lochridge et al., 2005) . Noroviruses are difficult to grow in cell culture but abundant quantities of virus-like particles (VLP) can be obtained by expressing VP1 in the baculovirus protein expression system. These VLP are morphologically and antigenically similar to the native strain (Jiang et al., 1992) .",

            "text": "Noroviruses, belonging to the family Caliciviridae, have been identified in human beings and in several animal species including cattle. The distribution of bovine norovirus infections was investigated by both RT-PCR to detect norovirus genomes and a virus-like particles-based ELISA to detect genotype 2 bovine norovirus antibodies. During a 1-year systematic study, a virus prevalence of 7.5% (CI 95%: [3.7; 13.4%]) (10 out of 133 samples) was found in stool samples from diarrhoeic calves screened by RT-PCR. Nucleotide sequencing performed on the polymerase region classified all the norovirus amplicons in the bovine norovirus genotype 2. Rather surprisingly, some rotavirus sequences were also detected. On the basis of the polymerase region, genotype 1 bovine norovirus was not identified. Other enteropathogens were found in all samples. By ELISA, a genotype 2 seroprevalence of 93.2% (CI 95%: [90.4; 95 .3%]) was found from calves and adult cattle. Antibody levels against genotype 2 bovine noroviruses rose in the first 6 months of life and were maintained in adults. Together the results of virus prevalence and seroprevalence studies suggest that bovine norovirus infection occurs early in life and that re-infection with serologically related bovine noroviruses strains could occur in adult cattle as reported for rotaviruses. The antibody rise against genotype 2 bovine noroviruses in the adult cattle also suggests a short lived and/or strain specific immunity as already shown in human noroviruses. Genotype 2 bovine noroviruses are endemic in the region investigated.",

Samples came from different places out of five provinces of Belgium (Hainaut, Namur, Liege, Luxembourg, Walloon Brabant). Their origin was either from diarrhoeic samples (n = 74) submitted for etiologic diagnosis of gastroenteritis or from necropsy samples (n = 59) where gastroenteritis lesions were found. This stool bank (n = 133) was screened by one step RT-PCR for the presence of BoNoV genome sequences with Quick Access kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Four different primer pairs were used to amplify segments of the polymerase gene and the beginning of the capsid region: CBECu (Smiley et al., 2003) , JV12/13 , P289/290 (Jiang et al., 1999) and BEC (Ike et al., 2007) . These primers were selected in order to perform the broadest detection of NoV including a possible zoonotic transmission. Out of the BoNoV specific primers (CBECu and BEC), CBECu pair was seen to detect not only genotypes 2 but also genotypes 1 BoNoV with an apparent sensitivity of about 83% relative to the p289/290 pair in a previous study (Smiley et al., 2003) . RT-PCR program consisted in a reverse transcription step of 45 min at 45 8C followed by the PCR reaction. It consisted in an initial denaturation step of 2 min at 94 8C followed by 40 PCR cycles (30 s denaturation step at 94 8C; 1 min annealing step at 48 8C for CBECu, JV12/13 and BEC primers, 51 8C for p289/290 primers; 2 min extension step at 68 8C) and a final extension step of 10 min at 68 8C. Positive amplicons were purified from agarose gel and cloned into pGEMt Easy (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Sequencing reactions were carried out on three clones of each amplicon with the BigDye terminator kit version 3.1 (AppliedBiosystem, Foster City, CA, USA) and resolved with an ABI 3730 automatic capillary sequencer (AppliedBiosystem, Foster City, CA, USA). Nucleotidic sequences were analysed with the BioEdit Sequence Editor version 7.0 software. Nucleotidic similarity with the NCBI genetic database was assessed using the BLAST tool (available at http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi). Phylogenetic inference was performed with the MEGA version 4 software package (Tamura et al., 2007) . Phylogenetic tree was constructed by neighbor-joining analysis where evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method. The confidence values of the internal nodes were calculated by performing 1000 replicates bootstrap values.",

The prevalence determined by RT-PCR analysis in this study is also similar to the results obtained by an antigen capture ELISA in Germany and developed using a genotype 1 JV strain (Deng et al., 2003) . As genotypes 1 and 2 BoNoV are antigenically Fig. 2 . Supernatants of the baculovirus expression of the capsid protein of the B309 isolate were submitted to purification in sucrose gradient. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed on each fraction and the membrane was stained with Coomassie blue. Results for some fractions are reported here (lanes 1-9) . Proteins of about 57 kDa, the expected molecular weight for the B309 capsid protein, were shown. Supernatant of Sf9 cells infected by a wild type baculovirus (lane WT) was used as negative control.

After uranyl acetate negative staining on Alcyan blue treated greads, particles with the specific size (approximately 40 nm) and morphology of calicivirus-like virions were readily observed. The nucleocapsids were isometric, showed icosahedral symmetry and the border has cup-shaped depressions. Bar, 50 nm. distinct (Oliver et al., 2006) , the true BoNoV prevalence could be higher or a preferential geographic distribution could exist. In contrast, Mattison et al. (2007) detected only 1.6% positive in stool samples from a random study in Canadian cattle but Smiley et al. (2003) detected up to 72% of samples positive in two farms in USA. In a longitudinal study in The Netherlands, prevalences of 31.6 and 4.2% were found in farm stool samples and individual samples of dairy cattle, respectively (Van Der Poel et al., 2003) . Thus, prevalence results by RT-PCR seem to depend on the continent, the country, the sampling strategy and especially on the test conditions (e.g. annealing temperature, primers, use of internal control as mentioned in Scipioni et al., 2008a) . Also the type of study, cross-sectional versus longitudinal as a part of the Dutch study, could explain some differences. BoNoV infection seems to be strongly related to the age with a higher rate in the first year of the animal life. Positive results were obtained along all the sampling period (data not shown) but further research is needed to investigate a potential seasonality for the infection unlike as described for HuNoV (Mounts et al., 2000) . In our results, we detected more isolates with the CBECu pair than with all the other pairs. Also, the CBECu primers allowed the detection of two bovine rotavirus 5 . Seroprevalence against bovine noroviruses in the Belgian cattle. The OD means of the different age groups of animals, collected in the ELISA format (unequal variance and non-normal distribution), were compared with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The distribution of the optical densities obtained with the indirect ELISA is represented in a box plot format where optical densities are reported in function of age classes. An asterisk highlights significant statistical differences between means of the different age groups. The cut-off is represented by the line at 0.3 and the dots represent extreme values. OD: optical density, negative control: optical density value obtained for the bovine negative serum (anti-rabbit IgG), positive control: optical density value obtained for the positive control (calf experimentally infected with the Newbury2 strain, Bridger et al., 1984) , mo: month, wk: week, yr: year. infections with however a small difference in the molecular weight for the amplicon (418 bp versus 532 bp). To our knowledge, such observation has never been reported and it could account for some differences between RT-PCR prevalence results depending on the primers used. Nucleotide similarities were found between the CBECu primers and the prototype bovine rotavirus sequence to which they matched by BLAST. On the 23 nt of the CBECu-F sequence, 14 nt including the last five nt matched exactly with the sequence of the bovine rotavirus polymerase (VP1, genbank accession number: J04346). Nucleotide similarity for CBECu-R was smaller. The CBECu-F primer was designed to match the widely conserved YGDD motif in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of RNA viruses (Bruenn, 1991) and this could explain the detection of bovine rotavirus. Some strains were detected with primers designed to detect HuNoV (JV pair) but at a low rate, as previously reported (Van Der Poel et al., 2003) . No HuNoV sequences were identified despite the use of two primer sets designed for their detection, suggesting at least a very low prevalence of these human viruses in cattle. Despite the variety of the primers used in the present study, the lack of detection of the genotype 1 BoNoV could be explained by suboptimal primer use for the RT-PCR (Oliver et al., 2007b) . The age of the cattle population studied was also suggested as an explanation for the lower detection of genogroup III genotype 1 NoV (Oliver et al., 2007b) . As RT-PCR primers used in this study only target the viral polymerase region and thus miss potential recombinant strains, the possibility that some positive samples contained chimaeric bovine noroviruses could be another explanation for the low apparent prevalence of GIII.1 noroviruses.",

In our conditions this serum reacts against a fraction containing VLP but also with infected Sf9 cells, in denaturing conditions. To test the specificity of this reaction against infected Sf9 cells, western blots were carried out with foetal calf serum and serum from a colostrum deprived newborn calf used in this study. With these two sera, a positive band at the same molecular weight was observed with baculovirus infected Sf9 cells under denaturing conditions whereas no reaction was detected in non-denaturing conditions (Mauroy and Thiry, unpublished results). These data confirm the nonspecific binding of bovine immunoglobulins on denatured protein extracts from baculovirus infected Sf9 cells. In nondenaturing conditions, the serum only reacts against VLP.

However the true genotype 2 seroprevalence should still remain high, even corrected for a lower sensitivity and specificity of the test. The OD values obtained with the serum raised against rabbit IgG in bovine confirmed the selected cut-off. Almost all colostrum deprived calves did not have antibodies against BoNoV as previously described (Deng et al., 2003) . It suggests that BoNoV infection is mainly localised in the intestine, according to the observations with HuNoV (Mattner et al., 2006) , and that vertical transmission of the virus is rare. The rise in antibody levels in 1 or 2 weeks old calves suggests an acquisition of antibodies through colostrum absorption or from early infection. Information on prevalence brought by the RT-PCR analysis suggests that the risk of infection during the first 6 months of life is high. The antibody levels determined by ELISA rise again in the post-colostral period (6 months to 1-year old).

Genbank accession numbers of strains used: AF097917 (Bo/NV/Newbury2/1976/UK); AJ011099 (Bo/ NV/Jena/1980/DE); AY12674 (Bo/NV/Dumfries/94/UK); EU877966 (Bo/NV/BV9/2007/BE); EU877967 (Bo/NV/BV15/2007/BE); EU877969 (Bo/NV/BV24/ 2007/BE); EU877970 (Bo/NV/BV52/2007/BE); EU877971 (Bo/NV/BV99/2007/BE); EU877972 (Bo/NV/BV119/2007/BE); EU877973 (Bo/NV/BV120/2007/BE); EU877974 (Bo/NV/BV129/2007/BE); EU877975 (Bo/NV/BV133/2007/BE); M87661 (Hu/NV/Norwalk 8FIIa/1968/USA). The tenth amplicon, Bo/NV/BV18/ 2007/BE, (Genbank accession number EU877968), was not introduced in the tree because its sequence was shorter.",
