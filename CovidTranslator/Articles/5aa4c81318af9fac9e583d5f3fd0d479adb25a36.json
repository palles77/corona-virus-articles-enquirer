The tube for sampling the mask particle count was connected to a test probe that was inserted through the fabric of the protective device. The probes were provided by TSI (TSI Incorporated, St Paul, MI, USA) for this purpose. The design of the probe is such that there is no leak around the insertion point, so the efficiency of the mask at filtering ambient particles should remain unchanged. The insertion site was centrally in the area directly in front of the mouth, as per the instructions for use provided by TSI. The tube for sampling the ambient particle count was fixed approximately 3 cm from the sampling probe.",

Although greater filtration was afforded by multiple masks, with an approximate doubling in the filtration factor when five masks were worn compared with a single mask, the absolute filtration factor remained low and well below the minimum fit factor of 100 required for a respirator. For this reason, even multiple masks are not a suitable alternative to N95 masks when the latter are available.",

If SARS Co-V is not transmitted by airborne particles but only by respiratory droplets and fomites, even one surgical mask is likely to protect the user to a significant degree. If the virus is spread by airborne transmission, the likelihood that surgical masks will provide significant protection is dependent on the viral load required to cause infection and the degree of viral shedding by the patient(s). If the number of viruses required to produce clinically significant infection is low and large numbers of viruses are shed by patients, it is unlikely that even multiple surgical masks will provide significant protection. If, however, large numbers of viruses are required and small numbers are shed, it is more likely that multiple surgical masks will provide significant protection. Unfortunately, those data are not available, although an epidemiological study has suggested that SARS is only moderately infectious. 5 Data from a recent retrospective multiple logistic regression study suggest that surgical masks may afford significant protection against SARS. This study showed that wearing either a N95 mask or a surgical mask reduced the risk of contracting SARS with little difference in risk reduction. 6 These data must be treated with considerable caution for two reasons. Firstly, the authors took no account of the degree of exposure of the wearers to high-risk situations. It is likely that staff exposed to high-risk situations would be more likely to wear a N95 mask, while those only exposed to low-risk situations would be more likely to wear a surgical mask. Without controlling for this confounding factor, it is not reasonable to compare the two types of mask. Secondly, the number of staff who contracted SARS was too small to allow meaningful multiple logistic regression analysis.",

If SARS CoV is carried on larger particles, it is possible that the masks may provide better protection than our results suggest. On the other hand, surgical instruments are known to produce submicron-sized particles that carry viable viral particles. 7 Furthermore, a study has shown that particles of up to 22 mm in size enter the respiratory zone when these masks are worn. 8 In conclusion, our data show that no combination of multiple surgical masks was able to meet the requirements for a respirator. If protection against airborne organisms is required, an N95 respirator or better should be used, as currently recommended by the CDC and WHO guidelines for SARS prevention. Multiple surgical masks will reduce the number of viruses inhaled, but whether the degree of reduction is sufficient to produce significant protection is unknown and cannot be predicted at present. Multiple surgical masks should, therefore, only be used if N95 masks are not available.",
