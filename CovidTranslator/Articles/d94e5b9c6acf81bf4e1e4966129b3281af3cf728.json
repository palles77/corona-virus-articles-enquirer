This paper presents these challenges and potential solutions. Methods: Real-world examples and situations are reviewed from an industry and patient-reported outcome (PRO) 2 expert position. Conclusions: An increase in the pursuit of new therapeutic targets, changes to the regulatory environment, and business pressures to expand clinical trials to more countries have significantly increased the complexity of confirmatory clinical studies that incorporate PROMs. Decisions to participate in collaborative efforts for endpoint development or proceed independently are made in the context of competing priorities of drug development timelines, drug differentiation strategies, the need for patient-related value messages, and the depth of a sponsor pipeline within specific disease areas. Study logistics are critically important; factors such as concept cultural relevancy, respondent literacy level, and quality of cross-cultural adaptation of PROMs must be evaluated when integrating into confirmatory clinical trials. Awareness of the issues relating to PROs in multiregional studies will enable companies to better plan studies and interpret results.",

            "text": "Well-controlled clinical trials are the most effective means to identify safe and efficacious pharmaceutical treatments. Confirmatory clinical trials, or phase 3 trials, are intended to provide firm evidence for efficacy and safety claims. Clinical trial primary endpoints are mainly a combination of physiological and clinical response measures. However, in addition to these endpoints, patient reported outcomes (PROs) are often included. Patient direct report is central to the overall evaluation of drug effect to fully understand how a patient feels or functions in response to a treatment. This understanding can be critical in assessing safety and efficacy and may provide important insight to generate patient-relevant information for pharmaceutical products [1] . PROs 3 are collected in an increasing number of clinical trials [2] via standardized questionnaires designed to measure an explicit concept (construct) such as symptoms, activity limitations, health status, HRQOL, 4 or QOL. 5 These questionnaires, also called instruments, scales, diaries, checklists, or measures, are collectively referred to as PROMs. 6 For new products approved between 2006 and 2010, almost a quarter of treatment-benefit claims granted by the US 7 FDA 8 were based on PROMs [3] .",

For example, the mental health impact of irritable bowel syndrome, as measured by the SF-36, 20 was shown to differ between patients in Greece and those in Sweden [23] . Reporting of symptoms associated with menopause varies among cultures [24] , and in Asian cultures, depression is often expressed somatically (upset stomach, loss of appetite) rather than emotionally (feeling blue) [25] . In addition, varying attitudes among cultures toward diseases such as obesity [26] and AIDS [27] may also impact PRO data in MRCTs.

For example, the target population may not be specific enough, or the impact of treatment on the target population may not be certain until the end of phase 2 studies.

The importance on the weight of \"fit for purpose\" evidence provided by the qualification process must be compared against competing priorities of drug development timelines, drug differentiation strategies, the need for patient-related value messages, and the depth of a sponsor pipeline within specific disease areas. These considerations often involve the needs of multiple stakeholders with competing priorities leaving study teams unable to formulate an effective PRO strategy. Regulatory acceptance of a wider number of PROMs in a larger number of disease areas may facilitate the development of future PRO strategies. Differences in regulatory needs between the FDA and EMA may always exist and teams will need to be poised to meet sometimes differing criteria.",

As a corollary to issues of cross cultural adaptation, we must be aware that some PRO data may be influenced by those other than the patient and may not be a reflection of the patient experience alone but instead a reflection of a more complex interaction between the patient, family, community or a physician/patient relationship. Teams must be aware of the needs and special challenges required and prepare for the resource needs to collect quality, evaluable PRO data so that the patient voice may continue to emerge from the context of confirmatory clinical trials. Awareness of the issues relating to PROs in multi-regional studies will enable companies to better plan studies, integrate PROs and interpret results.",
