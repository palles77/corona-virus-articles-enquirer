While R&D costs spiral higher, attrition statistics in clinical development show no signs of improvement and may actually be getting worse. For example, the FDA highlighted in March 2004 that a drug entering phase 1 clinical development in the year 2000 was less likely to reach the market than one that entered clinical development in 1985 [1]. It is a truism that much of the fate of a drug candidate in clinical development is embedded in the chemical structure and, hence, is in the control of the chemist at the point of design. Clearly, there are serious limitations on what drug designers have so far learnt about the relationship between chemical structure and attrition through clinical development.",

Indeed, there are a growing number of targets that we are trying to inhibit or activate for which we do understand the relationship between inhibition or activation of the target at the molecular level and their pathophysiological effect. Advances in structural and molecular biology, as well as in biophysics, have led to the determination of high-resolution atomic structures of many of the protein targets of drug discovery projects. For instance, p38 kinase is a target that is well validated in the clinic with respect to its role in inflammation, and many high-resolution crystal structures are available. The same is true for thrombin for anti-thrombosis and renin for hypertension, iNOS for inflammation, EGF receptor tyrosine kinase for cancer, as well as many antibacterial and antiviral targets. Crystal structures of some of the most important drug-metabolising enzymes are also known [2-7], which potentially enables the structure-based rational optimisation of potency, selectivity and metabolism. However, routine control of potency, selectivity and metabolism based on the use of structural information has yet to become a reality.",

            "text": "When protein crystal structures are used in structure-guided design, a number of fundamental assumptions are commonly made: (1) The protein structure is correct. It is usually assumed that the amino acid sequence is known and correct, that the structure model (including the water structure) is complete (i.e. no entities are missing) and that it is correct and known with high accuracy. (2) The structure of the ligand and its interactions with the protein are correct. An obvious assumption is that the chemical composition of the ligand is known and that its placement in the active site and its conformation is correct. A corollary of (1) and (2) is that the interactions between the receptor and the ligand are known, understood and correct. (3) The protein-ligand structure is relevant for drug design. It is usually tacitly assumed that the conditions under which the complex was crystallised are relevant, that the observed protein conformation is relevant for interaction with the ligand (i.e. no flexibility in the active-site residues) and that the structure actually contributes insights that will lead to the design of better compounds. While these assumptions seem perfectly reasonable at first sight, they are not all necessarily true. Instead, each of the assumptions has to be carefully verified on a case-by-case basis. The following sections (and also reference [8] ) describe some recent examples of cases where several of the above assumptions turned out to be invalid. They should act as a warning to any medicinal chemist embarking on a structure-guided drug-design project.",

            "text": "In the past 50 years, the determination of crystal structures of proteins, DNA, RNA, viruses and all manner of complexes has yielded fantastic insights into the molecular basis of myriad biological systems and processes. However, many scientists who use structural information seem to be unaware of the fact that an X-ray crystal structure is one crystallographer's subjective interpretation of an experimental electron density map expressed in terms of an atomic model [9, 10] . Such an interpretation may contain errors, it may not be complete, and there may exist alternative interpreta-tions for parts of it. In general, the resolution of the study and the degree of experience of the crystallographer are the most important factors determining the quality of the final model that is deposited in the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) [11] . Even when the resolution is very high, and the experimental data allow modelling of the structure at a great level of detail, there may still be parts of the structure for which the electron density is poor or that another crystallographer might have interpreted differently. If the resolution is low, the probability of errors and incomplete modelling of the data is much greater. Nevertheless, most chemists who undertake structure-based design treat a protein crystal structure reverently as if it was determined at very high resolution, regardless of the resolution at which the structure was actually determined (admittedly, crystallographers themselves are not immune to this practice either). Also, the fact that the crystallographer is bound to have made certain assumptions, to have had certain biases and perhaps even to have made mistakes is usually ignored. Assumptions, biases, ambiguities and mistakes may manifest themselves (even in high-resolution structures) at the level of individual atoms, of residues (e.g. sidechain conformations) and beyond. In general, the more serious such problems are, the less often they occur. However, even in this day and age it does occasionally happen that a crystal structure is published and deposited and later turns out to be seriously flawed.",

            "text": "The recent retraction in the journal Science of five papers and five structures (wwPDB codes 1JSQ, 1PF4, 1Z2R for MsbA and 1S7B, 2F2M for EmrE) of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters [12] sent shockwaves through the crystallographic and membrane protein communities. The fact that there was a problem with these models came to light when the structure of the related protein SAV1866 [13] was determined. This showed that the structures of MsbA and EmrE were incorrect and that their shape roughly resembled the mirror image of the correct structure. In this case, unfortunately, it appears that the incorrect structures have had serious adverse effects on the development of the field and possibly also on the distribution of grant money [14] . The location, direction and connectivity of several trans-membrane helices were incorrect [13] , and these errors completely invalidated any inferences made from the models. Some crystallographic statistics indicated problems, but this only caused the authors to resort to inappropriate refinement protocols. Although a 'software error' may have caused the initial problems, it is hard to see how the alarm bells that must inevitably have been set off could have been ignored during the five independent structure determinations (especially as some of the later models were determined to higher resolution at 3.7-3.8 \u00c5 ). Moreover, the models were incompatible with much of the available biological data [17] . Unfortunate deposition practices (of the crystallographers and the journals [15] ) meant that for the first model only C-a coordinates were deposited, and for only one of the five models were the experimental data ever deposited. This means that for a long time it was impossible to even reproduce the electron density maps for any ABC-transporter structure. A more detailed and technical discussion of this case can be found in [16] [17] [18] .",

Despite the homology of SarA and SarR, the models turned out to be significantly dissimilar [20] . The model for the apo-form of SarA (1FZN) was made obsolete (i.e. retracted) from the wwPDB in 2002, but the model for the DNA complex (1FZP) remains in the wwPDB to this day ( Figure 1 ). (We have been unable to identify any follow-up papers from the original laboratory addressing this issue.) In 2006, the structure of SarA was re-determined to 2.6 \u00c5 resolution (wwPDB code 2FRH) in the laboratory that had previously solved the structure of SarR [21] . SarA was now shown to have the expected fold: similar to SarR (and to the related proteins SarS and MarR) and dramatically different from the earlier SarA model. These authors also reproduced the crystals of the SarA-DNA complex and show that SarA has the same fold as in their apo-form (wwPDB code 2FNP).",

A year later, serious questions were raised about 'the strength of the experimental evidence supporting the presence of the target peptide, and consequently the validity of inferences about substrate binding' [23] . The matter was eventually resolved three years later with the determination of a 2.1 \u00c5 complex between botulinum neurotoxin type A protease and the human SNARE protein SNAP [24] (wwPDB code 1XTG). This structure, as well as additional calculations (see the supplementary material for [24] ), showed that the original model for the complex was incorrect and not supported by the crystallographic data. The incorrect model (1F83) has been retracted from the wwPDB (July, 2007), but the original paper has not (yet) been retracted.",

The structure of phenol hydroxylase was determined in 1998 to 2.4 \u00c5 resolution [25] (wwPDB code 1FOH). A few years later, 12 potential errors (one of which had already been identified in the original crystallographic work) were discovered in the sequence of this enzyme during construction of site-directed mutants [26] . Subsequently, crystallographic data to higher resolution (1.7 \u00c5 ) were collected and the structure was refined against these data. All 11 remaining sequence differences turned out to indeed have been errors, since the new residues fit the density much better than the incorrect ones [27] (wwPDB code 1PN0). Refinement to higher resolution led to improved free R values and identification of new features such as solvent molecules, main-chain shifts and altered sidechain conformations [27] . Interestingly, there was not a single large-scale error in the old model, but the differences were distributed throughout the whole model. It appeared that the old model was essentially correct and complete to the level of accuracy accorded by the lower resolution data. It may be worthwhile to revisit and re-refine crystallographic models once in a while, even if no serious errors are expected in the original model. Any model may be improved if the latest available refinement, validation and rebuilding techniques are used (and of course by inclusion of higher resolution data).",

            "text": "Fortunately, cases where (almost) the entire protein structure is modelled incorrectly are very rare. This usually occurs only if the resolution is low and if sensible procedures for model building, refinement and validation are jettisoned. However, it is important to remember that almost every crystal structure, even at atomic resolution, can have problematic parts or aspects [8] . Inspection of electron density together with the model (and preferably in the presence of the crystallographer!) may help in identifying any such parts and in assessing the reliability of the model in areas of particular interest (binding site, catalytic residues, interaction motifs, etc.). From 1 February 2008, the Worldwide Protein Data Bank have amended their deposition practices to require the deposition of structure factors as well as coordinates for all new structures. This means that all new publicly available structure models will be able to be viewed with the experimental data from which they were derived. The interested reader can obtain further information on good practice in the validation of protein structures from references [28, 29] and a tutorial is available at http:// xray.bmc.uu.se/embo2001/modval/. Furthermore, one should keep in mind that 'high-resolution questions' (e.g. pertaining to non-bonded distances or the precise position, orientation and conformation of sidechains and other interesting moieties) can only be answered reliably when high-resolution data are available. This is a truism of which even seasoned crystallographers need to be reminded occasionally!

            "text": "www.drugdiscoverytoday.com 833 once the structure of a protein is known, the crystallographic modelling of its ligand complexes should be straightforward, this is not always the case. In this section, we discuss some examples of problems that may arise. For instance, we have previously [8] described a case in which a ligand that had been modelled in complex with an enzyme was later found to be absent after closer inspection of the electron density [30, 31] . However, the opposite situation also arises frequently, namely that there is density for some entity (either retained from the expression system or present in the crystallisation soup) that is either not recognised as such by the crystallographer, or for which it is not possible to establish the chemical identity of the compound (or mixture of compounds). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptors for fatty acid ligands. When the structure of the ligandbinding domain of PPAR-b/d was determined in 1999 [32] (wwPDB code 2GWX), it was a major surprise to find that the apo-form of the domain displayed essentially the same conformation as the activated (ligand-loaded) form ( Figure 2a) . A few years ago, the apo-structure was re-determined in a different laboratory [33] and it was found that it contained a mixture of fatty acids (acquired from the bacterial expression system) in the ligand-binding site, with cis-vaccenic acid being the major component (wwPDB codes 2AWH and 2B50). This observation prompted the authors of the latter work to re-evaluate the earlier structure [34] . Using the original diffraction data of Xu et al. and their own high-resolution model as a molecular replacement probe, they solved and refined the structure anew (wwPDB code 2BAW). Initial electron-density maps clearly revealed the presence of a fatty acid in the binding site ( Figure 2b ). The density for this ligand (probably cis-vaccenic acid as well) had originally been modelled as a network of water molecules. Moreover, two molecules of n-heptyl-b-D-glucopyranoside, a compound that is important for crystallisation, which had previously been overlooked were identified in the density. The reevaluation of the older structure has several important implications [33] . First, the conundrum of the activated conformation in the 'apo' structure has been explained. Second, previously determined binding data involving this protein domain must be treated with caution, unless it is clear that any fatty acids were removed before the analysis. Third, the fact that the receptor binds endogenous fatty acid ligands tightly means that the possibility exists that it is constitutively active.",

Crispin et al. reported that about a third of the structures in the wwPDB that contain oligosaccharides have 'significant errors in carbohydrate stereochemistry, nomenclature or even consistency with the electron density maps' [41] . Some structures even contain previously unobserved glycosidic linkages that are incompatible with the known biosynthetic routes of N-glycan processing.

However, in an everyday structure-based design context other problems are likely to occur, and it is good to be aware of these pitfalls. Many of these problems have been discussed previously [8] , such as difficulties involved in determining the orientation of asparagine, glutamine and histidine sidechains and in the assignment of density features to water molecules. Other problems may arise when the density for a ligand is poor and the placement of the ligand by the crystallographer is questionable (but perhaps not debated!). As a matter of fact, modellers can make an important contribution themselves to the structure determination of protein-ligand complexes. First, their knowledge of organic chemistry and stereochemistry of small molecules is often better than that of a protein crystallographer, so the modellers could help formulate appropriate refinement dictionaries with proper restraints and target values for bond lengths, etc. Second, their knowledge of, and eye for, judging proteinligand interactions could help the crystallographer, by proposing ligand poses that both fit the electron density and make good sense in terms of protein-ligand interactions.",

The authors observed a flip of a peptide bond depending on whether zopolrestat was soaked in or co-crystallised. The peptide flip resulted in the rupture of a key hydrogen bond to the ligand. With tolrestat as the ligand, complexes with two different stoichiometries were obtained, one with one and one with four inhibitor molecules bound.

In an attempt to crystallise the ternary complex of the enzyme with pantoate and NADPH, crystals were obtained but the density showed no traces of pantoate and only a fragment of NADPH could be located. This fragment was confirmed to be 2 0 -phospho-ADP-ribose by mass-spectrometry experiments. Compared with the complex with NADP + , the ligand binds in the opposite orientation. Isothermal titration calorimetry with several mutants showed that the unusual binding mode is caused by changes in the protonation state of binding groups at low pH.

Pharmacophore models based on either set of structures worked well in discriminating true and decoy inhibitors, but the model based on the NMR ensemble appeared to be the most accurate yet general representation of the active site.

However, when the crystal structure of a complex was determined it was found that the alkynylpyrimidine compound displayed a distinctly different binding mode. The adenosinekinase structure accommodates the inhibitor by a 308 rotation of the small domain relative to the large domain, and the inhibitor binds in the opposite manner to what was expected.",

A pair of thrombin inhibitors where the S3/S4 hydrophobic binding group is homologated from cyclopentyl to cyclohexyl gave identical binding affinities, instead of the expected increase in affinity of 3-4 kJ/mol for the incorporation of an additional methylene unit. X-ray crystallography showed that while the cyclopentyl group gave good density in the S3/S4 pocket, the cyclohexyl compound showed ill-defined density in the difference maps. This was interpreted as either static or dynamic disorder of the cyclohexyl group. ITC revealed that the equality of the Gibbs free energy between the two inhibitors was factored into very different enthalpic and entropic contributions. While the free energy of binding of the cyclopentyl compound was factored equally between entropy and enthalpy, the cyclohexyl compound showed a relatively larger entropic advantage in binding, compensated for by a weaker enthalpic contribution to binding. This is consistent with the observations from the crystallography. The high residual mobility of the cyclohexyl group results in the loss of good enthalpic contacts but is compensated by the smaller entropy penalty paid. While enthalpy-entropy compensation is a generally observed phenomenon, reflecting the interplay between the enthalpic benefit from 'tight' interactions, to the entropic price paid to form them, it is still surprising that such subtle medicinal chemistry changes can result in such large unpredictable changes in the biophysics of the system, and such perfect compensation.",

But recent work suggests physicochemical property control has an even wider importance. Inflation of lipophilicity, molecular weight and hydrogen bonding interactions, and reduction in solubility, has been linked, not only to poor oral bioavailability, but also to unwanted metabolism, the number and severity of off-target activities [80] , various toxicological endpoints and even to overall attrition through clinical development [81] . Drug design requires careful control of these properties, while maintaining high target affinity. We have previously suggested that the use of protein structural information has enticed medicinal chemists to inflate lipophilicity, hydrogen bonding interactions and molecular weight to fill protein pockets and maximise the interactions at the ligand protein interface [52] . Protein structural information may be used in a different way. It may allow the rational replacement of undesirable functional groups to be made, positioning of physical property-controlling groups into solvent, capitalising on protein movement to capture different protein pharmacophores and the identification of highly ligand efficient motifs [82] .",

These models provide a strong stimulus to chemical creativity, through the direct visualisation of the ligand-receptor interactions. Such interactions are otherwise rather abstract to the medicinal chemist, whose only other alternative is to blindly feel his way forward using the tools of structure-activity analysis. For users of X-ray crystal structure information, however, it is important to realise that a crystal structure is a model, a crystallographer's partly subjective interpretation of experimental data. This interpretation may be flawed, ambiguous or inaccurate in its details (and in rare cases in its entirety). The best way to assess to reliability of a model is to discuss it with the crystallographer who produced it, to examine the model alongside the experimental electron density and to put the model to the test through iterations of structureactivity work.",
