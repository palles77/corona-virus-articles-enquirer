Lower R 0 estimates were generated in Nova Scotia and Ottawa. Final size projections that made use of complete time series were accurate to within 6% of true final sizes, but final size was using pre-peak data. Projections of epidemic peaks stabilized before the true epidemic peak, but these were persistently early (~2 weeks) relative to the true peak.",

Key activities that could be supported by rapid characterization and forecasting of epidemic dynamics include optimal allocation of vaccines, hospital resource management, and health communications. Mechanistic approaches such as compartmental models and agent-based models are commonly used to forecast influenza activity [6, 7] , but these typically require abundant data on population mixing and immunity patterns to produce relevant insights. The incidence decay with exponential adjustment (IDEA) model is a single-equation approach that requires knowledge of only 2 parameters [8] [9] [10] . The IDEA model has had some success in rapidly describing epidemic dynamics and forecasting epidemic peak and end dates based on limited data, and it has been applied to recent outbreaks of cholera [11] , Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [8] , and Ebola [9] .",

Although peak forecasts were off by approximately 2 weeks, forecasts had stabilized before the peak occurred, suggesting that accuracy may be improved with relatively simple adjustments in future; it may be that the persistent early peak projections generated by IDEA reflect the fact that the IDEA curve is symmetrical, whereas influenza epidemic curves may (as in this case) drop off sharply after the peak is reached. The IDEA model performed reasonably well in projecting final outbreak size. By early March 2016, we were able to estimate a final size of 11 002, compared with a total of 11 686 cases by the end of the outbreak, corresponding to error of approximately 6%, with final size estimates again having stabilized before the epidemic peak.

Although estimates from our 2 largest jurisdictions (Ontario and Alberta) were fairly consistent with one another, and also with pooled overall estimates, estimates generated using data from smaller jurisdictions and/or those with more restrictive testing algorithms (Nova Scotia virology laboratory and Ottawa Public Health) was more challenging. The small number of cases reported from these areas was associated with low estimates of R 0 . In general (and unsurprisingly), the smaller the sample size of the jurisdiction under analysis, the less stable, reliable, and timely projections appeared to be. Because frequency of testing or variability in testing practices may contribute to small test-positive numbers, it is unfortunate that we lacked testing data from most jurisdictions, which might have permitted us to evaluate the impact of tests per capita on usefulness of this modeling approach. Such explorations will be the subject of future work. Projections of final epidemic peak date generated using the incidence decay with exponential adjustment (IDEA) model for summed influenza counts from Ontario, Alberta, and Nova Scotia. The dates plotted on the x-axis are the dates of most recent influenza data used for model fitting; the y-axis represents the projected peak date. As noted in the text, peak date projections stabilized in mid-February before the true peak (first week of March 2016). Thus, a stable peak date was forecast before the true peak, but this forecast was persistently earlier than the true peak date. In addition, and as noted by an anonymous reviewer of an earlier draft of this paper, our early overestimation of reproduction numbers (and consequently, overestimation of d) early in the influenza season, is consistent with the tendency towards early overestimation of reproduction numbers noted by Mercer et al [18] . One possible reason for this overestimation relates to our \"seeding\" our models by assuming a single case at \"time zero\". Given the well described underdiagnosis of influenza [19] , this heuristic is may be problematic, and if our outbreak is seeded by >1 initial case that would result in reduction in early estimates of R 0 . It is unclear whether there may be some empirically derived inflation factor that might allow improved early performance (and timelier characterization of epidemics) by the IDEA model, but this represents an interesting question for future research.",

The 2015-2016 influenza season was atypical relative to other recent influenza seasons, with a late start and relatively low impact [20] . The mechanisms underlying these atypical dynamics are not clear, but better understanding of the impact of between-season variation in predominating circulating strain, and vaccine match and uptake, may in turn permit more accurate and timely model projections. This project focused on the ability to forecast influenza epidemics in real time, but better understanding of factors influencing model performance will likely also need to include historical data from well characterized influenza seasons, and we are currently engaged in such work.",
