Affected ferrets present with neurologic clinical signs, bronchopneumonia, hyperkeratosis of the planum nasale and footpads, and a papular rash starting on the chin. However, the most productive tissues to evaluate for viral inclusions are the urinary bladder, renal pelvis, and biliary epithelium, and in suspected cases these tissues should be submitted (Fig. 1) . Immunohistochemistry can be applied for confirmation. Bacterial nephritis and pyelonephritis occur in ferrets and can be severe. These conditions are thought to be caused by ascending infections of the lower urinary tract. A variety of organisms can be the cause. Grossly, the kidney may be abscessed and histologically there is necrosis and a neutrophilic infiltrate. Organisms may be seen but culture is necessary for a definitive diagnosis. Bacterial infection of the kidney, prostate, or urinary bladder can result in inflammatory cells (often undergoing degeneration) and bacteria in the urine.",

            "text": "Nephrocalcinosis is reported more frequently in European pet ferrets than laboratory ferrets, and lesions include calcium deposition in the renal tubules. 7 The cause of renal mineralization is usually not determined. Soft tissue mineralization is usually considered dystrophic (secondary to tissue injury) or metastatic (associated with excessive calcium in the blood), but neither cause is obvious in most cases seen at necropsy. The lesion is usually in the renal papilla. Rare cases of lymphomaassociated hypercalcemia have also resulted in renal dystrophic mineralization. The mechanism is most likely azotemia and the nephrotoxic effects of prolonged hypercalcemia. 8 Renal cysts are a common and usually incidental finding in the ferret (Fig. 2) . A 17-year retrospective analysis of 54 ferrets with cystic kidney disease noted that 69% had renal cysts, and 26% primary polycystic disease. 9 Cysts may be single or multiple and may be present in the cortex of 1 or both kidneys. It is speculated that acquired cysts arise from gradual distention of the nephron, caused by obstruction by exudates or fibrosis tissue, although the cause is seldom determined. Rare cases of true polycystic disease have been reported in the ferret. This congenital lesion may result in markedly enlarged cystic kidneys that fill the posterior abdomen. Many small cysts throughout the cortex and medulla characterize polycystic kidneys. Another rare congenital lesion is an extramural ectopic ureter. This condition is the most common congenital cause of urinary incontinence in domestic canines. Young ferrets present with urinary incontinence and urine scalding around perineal and inguinal areas. The ectopic ureter can be visualized via excretory urography. In 1 case, nephroureterectomy was chosen instead of ureteral transplant. The ureter progressed extramurally to enter the distal urethra, caudal to the urethral sphincter, or vagina (on contrast). 10 ",

            "text": "The most common renal neoplasm is malignant lymphoma. Lymphoma usually involves multiple organs and can be severe in the kidney. Grossly, there is variable replacement and distortion of the kidney. Histology is typical, with a diffuse monomorphic sheet of lymphoid cells. Impression smears can often provide a diagnosis. Other neoplasms have been reported, although primary tumors of the urinary tract system are uncommon. 11 From 1 study of 574 ferret tumors, only 6 urinary tumors were recognized. There were 3 renal carcinomas and 3 unspecified renal tumors. 11 Another study evaluating 856 ferret tumors identified only 1 renal tumor listed as a sarcoma, not otherwise specified, and lymphoma involving the kidney. 12 One renal adenocarcinoma is described in detail collected from an adult neutered female. This pleomorphic renal adenocarcinoma had multiple metastases to the lung, liver, greater omentum, right renal pelvis, and systemic lymph nodes. The tumor cells were pleomorphic with a large number of giant cells and arranged in tubular and cystic patterns. It was confirmed of renal origin by immunohistochemistry with strong positive CD10 and cytokeratin. 13 Two cases of transitional cell carcinoma arising from the renal pelvis, with 1 completely replacing the kidney, have been reported. The presenting complaint was hematuria. 14, 15 Obstructive disorders Urolithiasis The clinical signs of urolithiasis include stranguria and dysuria. Uroliths in ferrets commonly consist of sterile struvite or magnesium ammonium phosphate. Based on 1 study evaluating 272 cases, neutered males have a significantly increased risk of developing sterile struvite urolithiasis. 16 These uroliths are more likely to be retrieved from the lower urinary tract than from the upper urinary tract. 16 Stone formation is suspected to be caused by a vegetable-based protein diet that increases urine pH, leading to struvite stone formation. 17 Cystine uroliths are uncommon, with a reported incidence of 16% in 1 study evaluating 70 cases. 18 Again, males are predisposed to urolithiasis, possibly because the distal portion of the urethra has a J-shaped bend with a decreased diameter of the urethra. All cystine uroliths have been found in the lower urinary tract. 18 The uroliths are ovoid and smooth, light yellow to tan, and range in number from 1 to more than 100. Cystine uroliths are composed of nonessential sulfurcontaining amino acid; there may be a familial cause based on studies in other mammals. 18 Calcium oxalates are the next most common type of urolith. 19 Prostatic disease Other causes of urinary obstruction in the male ferret are abnormalities of the prostate caused by adrenocortical disease. Males can develop prostatic hyperplasia, cysts, and abscesses. Prostatic enlargement is caused by increased levels of the hormones estradiol, testosterone, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone produced by the neoplastic adrenal cortex from an adrenal gland tumor. Some animals develop concurrent urinary tract infection, including small urethral or cystic calculi. Urethral blockages can also be caused by sloughed proteinaceous debris from squamous metaplasia of prostatic tissue and by small struvite calculi, which develop from the increase in pH caused by bacterial cystitis. 20 Preputial tumors in male ferrets can also result in urethral obstruction. These aggressive tumors are poorly responsive to both surgery and radiation therapy. Nevertheless, wide surgical resection has been recommended, although the procedure may necessitate partial or total penile resection (Fig. 3) . 21 ",

From a study evaluating more than 100 rabbit uroliths, the most common were calcium carbonate (69.4%), compound (23%), and mixed (3.3%). 19 Radiographs are usually confirmatory because calcium carbonate is radiopaque (Fig. 7) . The predominance of calcium-based uroliths is most likely caused by the unique calcium metabolism of rabbits. Excess dietary calcium is absorbed unregulated, resulting in increased plasma calcium concentrations and excretion of excess calcium in the urine. Therefore, serum and urinary calcium levels are related to dietary intake. Urinary calcium can bind with other constituents when conditions are met for crystallization, such as dehydration, changes in pH, and urine retention, to form both the sludge (which can appear as thick white to yellow material) and uroliths. Abnormal accumulations of calcium (sludge) are more common in older rabbits, possibly because of decreased mobility or water consumption. 34 There are rare reports of uroliths composed of silica, struvite, and calcium sulfate dehydrate or gypsum. 35 The gypsum urolith was associated with the rabbit eating gypsumbased plaster that was covered by a white paint containing barium sulfate.",

The principles of treatment are supportive, and the overall goal is maintenance of quality of life. Even the goal of maintaining hydration has not been formally associated with increased longevity and improved quality of life in cats with CKD; however, the benefits of normohydration are considered obvious enough to continue recommendation of fluid therapy. 88 Unstable or decompensated patients benefit from hospitalization and intravenous (IV) fluid therapy. Fluid rates are based on calculation of hydration deficit: body weight (kg) times estimated dehydration (%) times 1000. Hydration deficit is added to maintenance fluids (50 mL/kg/24 h in cats) and provided over 24 to 48 hours. Once normohydration is achieved, fluid therapy continues at maintenance rate, monitoring the patient carefully for evidence of fluid overload.

As in other species, ARF may be prerenal (shock, hypovolemia), renal (renal disease), or postrenal (obstruction). Urine specific gravity plus changes in BUN and creatinine levels can be helpful. ARF is treated by correcting perfusion deficits (discussed later) and dehydration, and diuresis, along with correction of an identified underlying cause. Once the patient is rehydrated and normotensive, continue fluid administration as maintenance (3-4 mL/kg/h) plus estimated losses (diarrhea/vomiting, if present, and estimated urine volume). Based on information in domestic species, patients with ARF may become 3% to 5% dehydrated each day because of ongoing losses. Fluid administration is decreased when the patient maintains hydration, begins to eat and drink, and BUN/creatinine levels normalize. 89 IV catheterization is a standard procedure in rabbit medicine; IV access is also possible in large guinea pigs and some chinchillas. IV access may not be possible in any patient that is hypovolemic. For these cases, intraosseous (IO) catheterization is indicated. Placement sites in mammals include the proximal humerus, femur, and tibia.",
