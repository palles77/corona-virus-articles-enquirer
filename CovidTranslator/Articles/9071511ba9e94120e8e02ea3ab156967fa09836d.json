Rhinitis and cough are rare in GABHS pharyngitis. In viral disease the pharyngitis may not be the pressing complaint and is worsened by nasal blockade and breathing via the mouth especially during sleep. About 50% of people with rhinovirus or coronavirus colds have a scratchy, sore throat. Similarly, 50% to 80% of those with influenza A, parainfluenza, or adenovirus have pharyngeal discomfort. In adults with viral pharyngitis, fever and cough tend to be absent. Edema and redness of the pharynx are usual, but the degree of exudate is less effusive than in bacterial disease and painful lymphadenopathy is unusual. The course of events is gradual and centers on the nasal discharge, which is initially clear then in 2 to 3 days is greenish, then in another 2 to 3 days clear, then in another 1 to 2 days gone.

Because of the rare Diagnosis of IM rests on clinical suspicion coupled with positive antibody tests for EBV. Complete blood counts show atypical lymphocytosis or the hematologic complications listed previously. The monospot test reveals heterophil antibodies in up to %% of patients with IM. These antibodies are not directed against EBV but are induced by EBV. EBV-specific viral capsid antigen IgM antibody, the best indicator of primary infection, develops in 100% of cases. Viral capsid antigen IgG is a marker for prior infection. Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen antibody develops within 3 to 6 weeks and is a useful marker of acute infection if initially negative tests become positive. Early antigen-diffuse antibodies suggest severe disease. A positive early antigen-diffuse IgA correlates with a higher risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, whereas a positive early antigen-restricted IgA suggests a risk of Burkitt's lymphoma.",

Despite worries to the contrary, rebound pharyngitis following steroid therapy is rare and, when present, usually responds to a second course.5 However, the long-term consequences of prescribing steroids to patients infected with a virus that can survive in the tissues for years is unknown. EBV is especially worrisome because of its link to cancer; therefore, the clinician probably should avoid routinely prescribing steroids.

If necessary, the swab can be placed in a dry, sterile paper wrapper and left at room temperature for up to 24 hours, but preferably less than 6 hours. A 5% sheep blood agar plate is inoculated with the swab (Fig. 3) . Stabs are made into the agar, and a bacitracin disc (0.04 U of bacitracin, the A disc) is applied. Plates can be read in 24 hours. A positive culture shows beta hemolysis, a ring of inhibition about the A disc, and pinhead-sized Plating for GABHS requires rolling the throat swab across area 1 of sheep blood agar plate. A wire loop is heated to red then briefly cooled. Two passes are made into area 1 and spread in area 2. This process is repeated from area 2 to 3 in an attempt to isolate single colonies of GABHS.
