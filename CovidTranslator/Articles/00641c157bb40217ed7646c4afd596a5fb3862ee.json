Animal studies identified rhesus macaques but not hamsters, ferrets, or mice to be susceptible for MERS-CoV. Here, we investigated the role of DPP4 in this observed species tropism. Cell lines of human and nonhuman primate origin were permissive of MERS-CoV, whereas hamster, ferret, or mouse cell lines were not, despite the presence of DPP4. Expression of human DPP4 in nonsusceptible BHK and ferret cells enabled MERS-CoV replication, whereas expression of hamster or ferret DPP4 did not. Modeling the binding energies of MERS-CoV spike protein RBD to DPP4 of human (susceptible) or hamster (nonsusceptible) identified five amino acid residues involved in the DPP4-RBD interaction. Expression of hamster DPP4 containing the five human DPP4 amino acids rendered BHK cells susceptible to MERS-CoV, whereas expression of human DPP4 containing the five hamster DPP4 amino acids did not. Using the same approach, the potential of MERS-",

Although bats and dromedary camels have been identified as potential MERS-CoV hosts, the virus has so far not been isolated from any species other than humans. The inability of MERS-CoV to infect commonly used animal models, such as hamster, mice, and ferrets, indicates the presence of a species barrier. We show that the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 plays a pivotal role in the observed species tropism of MERS-CoV and subsequently identified the amino acids in DPP4 responsible for this restriction. Using a combined modeling and experimental approach, we predict that, based on the ability of MERS-CoV to utilize the DPP4 of common Middle East livestock species, such as camels, goats, sheep, and cows, these form a potential MERS-CoV intermediate host reservoir species.",

However, in contrast to SARS-CoV, which uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its cellular host receptor (15) , MERS-CoV utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) (16) . Interaction of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV spike protein with DPP4 initiates attachment to the host cell and subsequent virus internalization. The RBD was mapped to be a 231-amino-acid region in the S1 subunit of the spike protein (17) . DPP4 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, involved in cleavage of dipeptides and degradation of incretins (18) . DPP4 is widely expressed in different tissues, such as lungs and kidney, and the cells of the immune system, although a detailed description of DPP4 expression in the human respiratory tract and kidney is currently not available. DPP4 is relatively conserved between mammalian species, allowing the MERS-CoV spike protein to bind to both bat and human DPP4 (16, 18) .",

Most cell lines with a human, bat, nonhuman primate, or swine origin were found to be susceptible to infection with MERS-CoV. In contrast, cell lines originating from mice, hamsters, dogs, and cats were not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection (16, 19) . In vitro data on the species tropism of MERS-CoV appears to correlate with the in vivo host restriction of MERS-CoV; rhesus macaques can be experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, whereas inoculation of other commonly used animal models such as the Syrian hamster, mouse, or ferret did not result in efficient viral replication (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) . Recent studies suggest that DPP4 plays an important role in the nonsusceptibility of the mouse and ferret to MERS-CoV (28) (29) (30) .",

The intensity of staining was again variable, with weak staining in the hamster, moderate staining in the macaque and mouse, and intense staining in the ferret.

Specificity of MERS-CoV spike protein for DPP4. The DPP4 coding sequences of human, hamster, and ferret, obtained from GenBank or by sequencing, were cloned into expression vector pcDNA3.1(\u03e9) and transfected into cell lines nonsusceptible to MERS-CoV replication. The expression of DPP4 on transfected cells was determined by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry ( Fig. 3B and C). Transient expression of human DPP4 in BHK and primary ferret kidney cells allowed these previously nonsusceptible cells to support MERS-CoV replication, whereas transient expression of hamster DPP4 in BHK cells, ferret DPP4 in ferret primary cells, or GFP in either cell type did not render these cells susceptible to MERS-CoV replication (Fig. 3A) . As surface expression of human DPP4, but not hamster or ferret DPP4, allowed MERS-CoV replication in previously nonsusceptible cell lines, the observed MERS-CoV species tropism is most likely a result of the inability of its spike protein to bind to hamster or ferret DPP4 rather than the incompatibility of MERS-CoV with the hamster or ferret cellular machinery.",

Recent cocrystallization studies of the MERS-CoV spike protein and the human DPP4 identified 14 amino acids in DPP4 important in binding to the MERS-CoV spike protein (36, 37) . Alignment of the DPP4 amino acid sequences of human and hamster origin revealed a total of five differences within these 14 amino acids (Table 2) . To investigate the binding potential of the different DPP4s to MERS-CoV spike protein, DPP4 homology models were built using the human DPP4 structure (PDB ID 4KR0, chain A) as a template (36) . Of the five amino acid residues at the RBD interface that differ between human and hamster DPP4, the residues at positions 291 and 336 appear to be most critical for the species specificity. In the human DPP4-RBD crystal structure, the small methyl side chain of Ala291 in DPP4 nestles into a small pocket in the RBD, which cannot accommodate the size and charge of the corresponding glutamic acid residue found in the hamster DPP4 molecule. This steric clash alone is likely sufficient to abrogate binding. In addition, the side chain of Arg336 in human DPP4 forms hydrogen bonds with RBD residue Tyr499 and a salt bridge to RBD residue Asp455. These interactions would not be formed by the corre-sponding threonine side chain in hamster DPP4. The remaining three DPP4 residues at the RBD interface that differ in humans and hamsters are conserved substitutions and are not predicted to greatly impact binding to the RBD (Fig. 4A) . Furthermore, these analyses showed that hamster DPP4 has significantly higher binding energy (less favorable interactions) than human DPP4 to MERS-CoV (Fig. 4B) . When mutant DPP4s were designed in silico by introducing the five human-specific amino acid residues (Ala291, Ile295, Arg336, Val341, and Ile346) into the hamster DPP4 (humanized hamster DPP4) and the five hamster-specific amino acid residues (Glu291, Thr295, Thr336, Leu341, and Val346) into the human DPP4 (hamsterized human DPP4), a reversion of the binding energies was found; the binding energy associated with the humanized hamster DPP4 and MERS-CoV spike protein complex was lower than that of hamsterized human DPP4 and MERS-CoV spike protein (Fig. 4B ). This suggests that the five DPP4 human-specific amino acid residues are responsible for the ability of MERS-CoV spike protein to bind to DPP4.",

MERS-CoV was found to be unable to infect some of the major respiratory animal models (Syrian hamster, mouse, and ferrets [24, 26, 27] ), in contrast to the ability of MERS-CoV to replicate efficiently in rhesus macaques (23) . This suggests the existence of a host-barrier restriction of MERS-CoV for some species. Using in vitro growth kinetics of MERS-CoV, we were able to demonstrate this host species restriction in cell lines from different mammalian origins. MERS-CoV replicated efficiently in cells of human and nonhuman primate origin but was not able to replicate in cells of mouse, hamster, or ferret origin, despite the presence of DPP4 (Fig. 1) . Analysis of the presence of DPP4 in Syrian hamster, mouse, and ferret lung and kidney tissues as well as the rhesus macaque lung and kidney tissues suggested that the inability of MERS-CoV to infect Syrian hamster, mouse, and ferret is not due to a lack of expression of the DPP4 receptor (Fig. 2 ). Our hypothesis that the host species restriction of MERS-CoV lies on the receptor binding level was supported by the lack of replication in hamster and ferret cells upon exogenous expression of the hamster or ferret DPP4 on the surface of these cells, whereas expression of the human DPP4 receptor rendered these previously nonpermissive cell lines permissive for MERS-CoV (Fig. 3) . We observed a \u03fe2 log difference in growth of MERS-CoV between hamster and ferret cells, which may be explained by the difference in transfection efficiency (BHKs, 93.0%; primary ferret cells, 65.8%; Fig. 3B ). The cocrystallization between the human DPP4 and the MERS-CoV spike protein revealed the receptor binding domain of MERS-CoV and the amino acid residues of human DPP4 interacting with this domain (36, 37) . Align- ment of DPP4 amino acid residues identified as interacting with the MERS-CoV spike protein between human and rhesus DPP4s (binders) and hamster DPP4 (nonbinder) revealed a minimal subset of five amino acid changes between the human and the hamster DPP4 (Table 2 ). These five differential human amino acid residues were introduced into the hamster DPP4 (humanized hamster DPP4), and the five differential hamster amino acid residues were introduced into the human DPP4 (hamsterized human cells. Mean titers were calculated from three independent experiments. Error bars indicate standard deviations. (B) BHK cells were left untransfected (red) or transfected with DPP4 (blue) and stained 24 h posttransfection using anti-DPP4 (R&D) and an FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Life Technologies). Samples were collected using an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software. (C) Expression of DPP4 mRNA was measured via qRT-PCR. Relative fold increase was calculated by the comparative C T method (35) , where DPP4 expression is normalized to HPRT. DPP4). Expression of the humanized hamster DPP4 in BHK cells rendered these cells permissive for MERS-CoV, whereas expression of hamsterized human DPP4 did not change the nonpermissiveness of the cells (Fig. 5) . For ferret DPP4, it was recently shown that exchanging the amino acid region 246 to 505 with that of human DPP4 resulted in the ability of MERS-CoV to utilize this chimeric DPP4 (28), as was the case for mouse DPP4 when exchanging amino acids 279 to 346 with the human DPP4 counterpart (29) . In addition, both of these studies found amino acids to be important in spike binding that were identified in this study (295, 336, and 346 for mouse and 295, 336, and 341 for ferret) (28, 29) . Interestingly, although the humanized hamster DPP4 was able to facilitate MERS-CoV infection, MERS-CoV titers were considerably lower. This could indicate that although substitution of five human amino acids into hamster DPP4 is sufficient for spike binding, additional amino acid residues in the interface might be required for optimal binding and infectivity. Currently, the only available animal disease model for MERS-CoV is the rhesus macaque. Research into therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures is severely restricted by the absence of a small animal model allowing high-throughput in vivo screening of antivirals with in vitro efficacy or candidate vaccines (24, 25, (39) (40) (41) (42) . Our data indicate that transgenic mice expressing the human DPP4 will likely be susceptible to MERS-CoV and would allow the establishment of a much-needed small-animal model. This is supported by recent experimental evidence which showed that transient expression of human DPP4 in the lower respiratory tract of mice supported MERS-CoV replication (43) .",

Utilizing the same model, DPP4s of species implicated in the emergence of MERS-CoV (dromedary camel, sheep, goat, and cow) were predicted to be able to bind to the spike protein of MERS-CoV (Fig.  4B ). DPP4 modeling data were supported by experimental work showing that indeed the DPP4s of dromedary camel, sheep, goat, and cow were able to support MERS-CoV replication (Fig. 6) . MERS-CoV-like antibodies have been found in dromedary camels but not yet in goat, sheep, or cow species (7, 44) . However, DPP4 from goat, cow, and sheep can function as a receptor for MERS-CoV, although with lesser efficiency (Fig. 6) . Protein sequence alignments of full-length and partial DPP4 revealed that camel DPP4 differs from goat, cow, and sheep DPP4, in particular when amino acids 220 to 350 of DPP4, which are of importance in spike binding, were investigated (Table 3 ). It is possible that subtle dif-ferences in binding of spike and DPP4 account for the apparent lack of MERS-CoV circulation in the goat, cow, and sheep population. The close evolutionary relationship between MERS-CoV and bat CoVs as well as the detection of a short fragment of viral RNA in a bat in Saudi Arabia suggest that MERS-CoV originates from bats (1, 3) . The ability of MERS-CoV to utilize the DPP4 from an insectivorous bat underlines the broad host range (16) . Future receptor binding and experimental infection studies are needed to investigate the suitability of different bat species to function as a host for MERS-CoV.",

The replication of MERS-CoV correlates with DPP4 expression on type I and II pneumocytes in the lungs of rhesus macaques (Fig. 2) (25) . The presence of DPP4 in the lower respiratory tract of dromedary camel, sheep, goat, and cow (Table 1) suggests that the tropism of MERS-CoV for these species could be similar to the respiratory tropism observed in rhesus macaques and humans (13, 14, 25) . Since the first emergence of MERS-CoV in 2012, the epidemiology has remained unclear. The recent identification of the circulation of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels (6) (7) (8) (9) together with the multiple introductions of MERS-CoV into the human population (11, 12) suggests that both zoonotic transmission from an intermediate host and human-to-human transmission occur simultaneously. Our data support the potential for the existence of one or multiple natural reservoirs for MERS-CoV. Although our data do not provide any formal proof for the existence of such a reservoir, the ability of DPP4s of cows, sheep, goats, and dromedary camels (the major Middle East livestock species) to function as a MERS-CoV receptor and the abundant DPP4 presence in the respiratory tract of these species suggest that they would be susceptible for MERS-CoV infection. The combination of modeling the binding energies of the MERS-CoV spike with the DPP4s of different species and a molecular experimental approach could guide field programs focused at identifying the existence of an intermediate host. With the potential susceptibility of major livestock species for MERS-CoV, renewed focus should be aimed at elucidating the existence of an intermediate host and thereby preventing further spread of MERS-CoV. a Full DPP4 and partial (amino acids 220 to 350) DPP4 protein sequences were compared, and percent identities were analyzed using MegAlign software.",
