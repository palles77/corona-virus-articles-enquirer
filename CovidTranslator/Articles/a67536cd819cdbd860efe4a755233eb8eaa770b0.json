The infection can eventually lead to hepatocellular carcinoma, liver failure, or cirrhosis, and causes ~ 1 million deaths every year [1] . Treatments for chronic HBV typically involve the life-long administration of approved drugs (e.g., nucleotides and interferon-\u03b1 therapies) that are costly and require patient compliance. Long-term interferon therapy can induce many adverse effects [2] ; therefore, interruption to treatment results in unavoidable viral rebound. Less than 10% of patients achieve functional cure, defined as anti-HBs seroconversion [3, 4] . There is thus an urgent need for new treatments that can effectively control the HBV epidemic and eventually eradicate chronic HBV infection.",

HBV cccDNA elimination is currently only achieved by antiviral immune responses [5] ; however, HBV-specific T cells are scarce and are functionally impaired in the context of chronic HBV infection most likely due to high amounts of circulating viral HBeAg and HBsAg [6] . A therapeutic vaccine that is combined with antivirals might restore a functional T-cell response and achieve anti-hepatitis B seroconversion while minimizing the risk of adverse effects. Numerous therapeutic vaccination strategies have been developed over the past 20 years and some have even entered clinical trials. Unfortunately, all these clinical trials have showed disappointing results [7, 8] .

A TLR7 agonist has also been reported to induce an innate cytokine response that suppresses HBV replication and to shape the adaptive immune response to achieve durable control of HBV infection [13] .

We found that T7-EA induced more potent SEAP reaction than T7 in HEK-Blue hTLR7 reporter cells, but no activity was observed in inducing SEAP reaction in HEK-Blue hTLR8 reporter cells, suggesting that T7-EA is a specific TLR7 agonist that is more potent than T7 (Fig. 3a, b) . We next assessed the immunological effects of T7-EA in PBMCs. We treated PBMCs from 3 healthy donors with T7-EA and T7 at different concentrations for 18 h, and determined the levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the supernatants. Here, we found that T7-EA showed differential capacity to induce IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6 expression than T7. Specifically, we observed higher levels of IFN-\u03b1 expression induced in response to 30 nM T7-EA treatment compared to T7 treatment (Fig. 3c) , but higher levels of IL-6 expression induced in response to 3 and 10 \u03bcM T7-EA treatment compared to T7 treatment in human PBMCs (Additional file 5: Fig. S2A ). These data are consistent with the RNA-seq analysis that showed that T7-EA and T7 treatments induced similar gene expression profiles in genes involved in TLR signaling but showed different activities in inducing ISGs. We also isolated BMDMs and BMDCs from C57BL/6 mice, and then cultured and stimulated the cells with different concentrations of T7-EA, T7 and R848. The three agonists induced IL-6 expression in a dose-dependent manner in BMDMs and BMDCs: R848 was the most potent agonist with an EC 50 < 30 nM, while the EC 50 of Fig. 2 Evaluation of T7-EA activity by RNA-sequencing in Raw264.7 cells. a DEGs between T7-EA and T7 treatments. 1 \u00d7 10 6 Raw 264.7 cells were treated with 10 \u03bcM T7 or T7-EA for 24 h.

A therapeutic vaccine should, therefore, overcome immune tolerance and induce a protective immune response for HBV clearance [29] . We further tested the efficiency of our newly designed HBV therapeutic vaccine, consisting T7-EA adjuvant, Alum adjuvant and a recombinant HBsAg protein, in breaking immune tolerance in an HBV mouse model. The HBV mouse model was generated using a recombinant AAV carrying the HBV genome (AAV/HBV) that was previously reported as an appropriate model for developing novel therapies for chronic HBV infection [30] . Two months after tail vein injection of the AAV/HBV virus, we administered our HBV therapeutic vaccine intraperitoneally on days 0, 14 and 28. We then detected HBsAg, HBsAb and HBV genomic DNA in the serum at different time points before sacrificing the mice to evaluate the HBsAg-specific T-cell response on day 132 (Fig. 5a) . The HBV therapeutic vaccine could induce 3-sixfold increase and persistent HBsAb response compared to a traditional HBV vaccine from days 72 to days 132 (Fig. 5b) , and a significant increased HBsAg-specific T-cell response. Notably, all the mice that received the HBV therapeutic vaccine achieved a HBsAg-specific T-cell-positive response (Fig. 5c, d) . We also noted significant downregulation of HBV DNA copies and HBsAg titers in mice receiving the HBV therapeutic vaccine compared to those receiving normal saline, but no significant difference between mice receiving the HBV therapeutic vaccine and traditional vaccine (Additional file 7: Fig. S3A, B) . These data were immunized intraperitoneally with 2 \u03bcg HBsAg mixed with 100 nmol T7, T7-EA or R848 at day 0, 14 and 28.

In this study, we aimed to generate a preferable TLR7 agonist that could be used as adjuvant in an HBV therapeutic vaccine. we chemically synthesized a novel TLR7 agonist, T7-EA by conjugating our reported TLR7 agonist SZU-101 (T7) to ethacrynic acid (EA) [34] , the function group of T7 and the \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated ketone group of EA were kept. We then performed RNA-seq to evaluate T7-EA activity in Raw 264.7 macrophages that overexpress TLRs. Here, T7-EA retained the function exhibited by unmodified T7 in terms of stimulating similar genes involved in TLR signaling. We did note, however, significant differences between T7-EA and T7 treatments in terms of ISG induction. We then moved our analyses to hTLR7 and hTLR8 reporter cell lines, primary immune cells and in vivo model to characterize T7-EA. We found that T7-EA is an hTLR7-specific agonist and is more potent in inducing IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6 expression compared to T7. In addition, T7-EA exhibited HBsAg-specific IgG levels in the serum were measured by ELISA at the indicated time points. c HBV mice were sacrificed at day 132 and splenocytes were isolated; then, HBsAg-specific T cells were detected by Elispot assay. The cells were cultured at a density of 3 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well with 20 \u03bcg/mL HBsAg in a 96-well pre-coated Elispot plate for 18 h. SFC in 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells are shown. d HBsAg-specific T-cell positive rates. SFC were detected with Elispot and the cells cultured without HBsAg stimulation were used as a negative control. SFC in experimental wells with two times more than the negative control wells were regarded as being HBsAg-specific T-cell positive. SFC, spot-forming cells tissue-retaining activity and could stimulate local cytokine and chemokine expression for up to 7 days. To evaluate the adjuvant capacity, we administered T7-EA intraperitoneally in a formulation with Alum adjuvant and a recombinant HBsAg protein. T7-EA could induce Th1-type immune responses, as evidenced by an increased HBsAg-specific IgG2a titer and T-cell response compared to traditional HBV vaccine in normal mice. Importantly, T7-EA could break immune tolerance and induce persistent, high quality HBsAg-specific antibody and T-cell responses in HBV-infected mice. These data thus suggest that T7-EA might be used as an adjuvant in a prophylactic and therapeutic HBV vaccine. The small-molecule characteristics of TLRs 7/8 agonists renders them easy to synthesize and modify, but their fast metabolism and narrow drug effect window properties has led to inefficient and inconsistent results thus far [16] [17] [18] . Therefore, several strategies have been devised to optimize TLR 7/8 agonists, such as conjugation with HIV-1 Gag protein for vaccine development, synergy with CD40 and CpG ODN in augmenting immune responses and the invention of novel imidazoquinolines for adjuvant application [16, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . In this study, we chemically conjugated a TLR7 agonist to EA: EA contains a \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated ketone group that can automatically bind to thiol-containing proteins, such as LEF1 [40] . There is an abundant resource of thiol-containing proteins in cells, tissues and body fluids, meaning that T7-EA with a \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated ketone group should possess new drug activity [41] . In our system, T7-EA acquired the exo-methylene group which we found enabled T7-EA to automatically bind to sulphur proteins, such as GSH, GSH-T7-EA [M + 1] 936.2. We propose that the \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated ketone group might underlie why T7-EA has different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics compared to unmodified T7. TLR7 signaling activation in early and newly formed endosomes is linked to type I interferon synthesis [42] , whereas TLR7 signaling activation in late-stage endosomes induces cytokines (such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) in a NF-\u03baB-dependent manner [42] . T7-EA showed more potent TLR7 activation activity compared to T7, but we observed significantly different doe-dependent activity in inducing NF-\u03baB-associated genes and ISGs. To clarify the mechanism of the different activity between T7-EA and T7 in inducing NF-\u03baB-associated genes and ISGs, we think that the distribution of T7-EA and T7 in endosomal vesicles across different stages is worth exploration.",

            "text": "TLR7/8 activation leads to Th1 cytokine production, MHC and co-stimulatory molecule upregulation and dendritic cell (DC) maturation. Thus, TLR7/8 agonists are able to drive T-cell-mediated and B-cell-mediated adaptive immune responses [43, 44] . Local DC cell activation is critical for initiating adaptive immune responses; however, reported pharmacokinetic studies in humans, in which imiquimod solution was injected subcutaneously, showed that the serum levels were detectable within 5 min post-dosing (Tmax: ~ 30 min) and > 95% of the imiquimod was eliminated after 12 h [18] . The short halflife of imiquimod at the injection site is likely suboptimal for local DC activation. Thus, a novel adjuvant (Alum/ TLR7) formed by attaching a TLR7 agonist to Alum has been designed [15] . Alum/TLR7 shows better local stimulation effects and adjuvant capacity compared to Alum and T7 alone. Alum/TLR7 is currently in phase I clinical development and has been tested in several disease models, such as in the context of staphylococcus, anthrax, meningococcal meningitis infections [15, 27, [45] [46] [47] .",

We also found a synergistic effect in the T7-EA and Alum combination group, which induced a further increase in the HBsAg-specific T-cell response compared to all other experimental groups. Further studies showed that T7-EA could break immune tolerance and induce persistently high quality HBsAg-specific antibody and T-cell responses in an HBV mouse model. Compared to Alum/ TLR7, T7-EA is a small molecule easier to synthesize, store and use, and has a more stable chemical structure.
