As we indicated, the final version of the pamphlet was prepared after many interviews and discussions with patients before, and it varying intervals after, the oper-",

We should add that we found that the pamphlets were borrowed and read by other patients in the ward and many of those admitted for hysterectomy under other firms complained that they had not received copies.

The number of F.C. cases was at the same level for this period of the year as in the past, while the incidence of A.H.C. appeared to be unusually high. The symptoms of patients with A.H.C. were ocular pain, sudden swelling, congestion, and watering: the subconjunctival hremorrhage varied from petechiee to small blotches covering the whole bulbar conjunctiva. The cornea was not involved, hremorrhagic symptoms generally subsided within a week, and recovery was complete within the follow-E. P. BASS R. L.
