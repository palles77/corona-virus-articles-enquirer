            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (family Coronaviridae, genus Deltacoronavirus) is a novel swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes acute diarrhea/vomiting, dehydration and mortality in seronegative neonatal piglets. PDCoV diarrhea was first reported in the US in early 2014, concurrently with co-circulation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (family Coronaviridae, genus Alphacoronavirus). The origin of PDCoV in pigs and also its sudden emergence or route of introduction into the US still remains unclear. In the US, since 2013-2014, the newly emerged PDCoV and PEDV have spread nationwide, causing a high number of pig deaths and significant economic impacts. The current US PDCoV strains are enteropathogenic and infect villous epithelial cells of the entire small and large intestines although the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites of infection. Similar to PEDV infections, PDCoV infections also cause acute, severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by transient viremia (viral RNA) that leads to severe diarrhea and/or vomiting, followed by dehydration as the potential cause of death in nursing piglets. At present, differential diagnosis of PDCoV, PEDV, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is essential to control viral diarrheas in US swine. Cell culture-adapted US PDCoV (TC-PDCoV) strains have been isolated and propagated by us and in several other laboratories. TC-PDCoV strains will be useful to develop serologic assays and to evaluate if serial cell-culture passage attenuates TC-PDCoV as a potential vaccine candidate strain. A comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of epidemic PDCoV strains is currently needed to prevent and control the disease in affected regions and to develop an effective vaccine. This review focuses on the etiology, cell culture isolation and propagation, molecular epidemiology, disease mechanisms and pathogenesis of PDCoV infection.",

PDCoV was first reported in pigs in Hong Kong in 2012 (Woo et al., 2012) . Among a total of 7140 rectal, tracheal, or cloacal swab samples from wild Asian leopard cats, bats, wild birds, domestic cats, cattle, chickens, dogs, pigs, rodents, monkeys, and humans in China and Hong Kong in 2007-2011, DCoVs were detected only in pigs and wild birds, with a 10.1% positive rate for PDCoV in the 169 swine rectal swab samples tested (Woo et al., 2012) . However, it appears that DCoVs were present in rectal swabs of small mammals, such as Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret badgers, at live-animal markets in China since 2005 -2006 (Dong et al., 2007 . PDCoV diarrhea was first reported in the US in early 2014 (Li et al., 2014; Marthaler et al., 2014b; Wang et al., 2014a, b) , concurrently with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (family Coronaviridae, genus Alphacoronavirus), which causes similar, but more severe clinical disease in neonatal piglets (Cima, 2013; Stevenson et al., 2013) . Recent studies reported that PDCoV CHN-AH-2004 and CH/Sichuan/S27/2012 strains, genetically related to the current US PDCoV strains, were previously present in diarrheic piglets in China in 2004 and 2012, respectively, prior to the first outbreak of PDCoV infection in the US in early 2014 (Dong et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015b) .",

However, a recent study reported evidence of antigenic cross-reactivity between PDCoV Michigan/8977/2014 strain and PEDV, possibly sharing at least one conserved or similar epitope on their N proteins, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot using monoclonal PEDV and PDCoV N-specific antibodies, whereas no cross-reactivity was detected when virus neutralization, indirect immunofluorescence, and immunostaining assays were conducted on either virus-infected cells or intestinal tissues using pig hyperimmune antisera to PEDV or PDCoV (Ma et al., 2016) .",

Trypsin contributed to a significant increase in PDCoV growth after several passages in LLC-PK cells. However, even without supplemental trypsin, PDCoV replicated in LLC-PK cells, but without cytopathic effects (CPE) and at relatively lower virus titers compared to the trypsin supplemented cell cultures (Hu et al., 2015) . Thus, trypsin is not essential, but is beneficial for the propagation of PDCoV in LLC-PK cells. The cell-culture conditions required for the propagation of PDCoV in ST cells differ from those in LLC-PK cells. Trypsin did not support PDCoV propagation in ST cells. In contrast, PDCoV could be serially propagated in ST cells supplemented with pancreatin or small intestinal contents from gnotobiotic (Gn) piglets (Hu et al., 2015) . The addition of trypsin and pancreatin in PDCoV-inoculated LLC-PK and ST cells, respectively, resulted in similar CPE that consisted of enlarged, rounded, and densely granular cells that occurred singly or in clusters and then, cell shrinkage and detachment as a result of apoptotic cell death Hu et al., 2015) . The roles of trypsin or pancreatin in cell entry and release of PDCoV virions in LLC-PK or ST cells remain unknown.",

In 2006, novel coronaviruses were detected in feces of wild Asian leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis) and Chinese ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) during a virological surveillance for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in southern China. The isolates were genetically similar to each other and commonly had low amino acid similarity and unique phylogeny distinct from other coronavirus groups (Dong et al., 2007) . The two isolates were subsequently shown genetically to belong to Deltacoronavirus (Woo et al., 2012) .

PDCoV RNA was detected in fecal samples collected on August 19th 2013 from Minnesota, August 20th and August 27th from Iowa, and August 29th 2013 from Illinois (Sinha et al., 2015) . Based on these data, PDCoV has been present in US swine since at least August 2013. Another retrospective study using an indirect ELISA for the detection of PDCoV IgG antibodies demonstrated their prevalence in US pigs (Thachil et al., 2015) . A total of 968 serum samples collected between 2006 and 2014 were tested. The PDCoV IgG antibodies were first detected in the archival serum samples collected in 2010 (Thachil et al., 2015) . However, the origin of US PDCoV in US swine remains unclear.",

            "text": "To date, PDCoV also has been reported in Canada, Korea, China, and Thailand. Epidemic diarrhea related to PDCoV was first detected in 6 Ontario farms in Canada in March 2014 (Marthaler et al., 2014b) . In April 2014, PDCoV (KUN14-04 strain, Genbank accession no. KM820765) was first identified in feces of diarrheic piglets in South Korea. The Korean strain had nt identities of 98.8-99.0% to HKU15-44 and HKU15-155 and 99.6-99.8% to US PDCoV strains (Lee and Lee, 2014) . A recent survey conducted in South Korea reported that of 691 diarrheic fecal samples collected on 59 pig farms in January 2014 to March 2015, only 2 samples from 1 pig farm (March 2015) were PDCoV-positive by RT-PCR (Lee et al., 2016) . Two Korean PDCoV strains SL2 and SL5 isolated in the study were also closely related to US PDCoV strains, but they appeared to genetically differ from the previous Korean strain KNU14-04 isolated in 2014 (Lee et al., 2016) . The first identification of PDCoV HKU15-44 and HKU15-155 strains in swine in Hong Kong, China for the period 2007-2011 were documented in 2012 (Woo et al., 2012) . Since then, PDCoV has been identified in diarrheic pigs in mainland China (Dong et al., 2015; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015b) . A study also found PDCoV RNA in diarrheic pig samples collected in 2004 in China (Dong et al., 2015) . The prevalence of PDCoV in mainland China was high (>30%), and co-infections with PDCoV and PEDV (51%) were also common (Dong et al., 2015; Song et al., 2015) . All PDCoV strains reported from China shared high nt identities (\u226598.9%) with each other and with the other PDCoV strains found globally (Dong et al., 2015; Song et al., 2015) (Fig. 1B) , implying a possible global circulation of a single genotype. PDCoV strains with multiple mutation or deletion sites in their S, nonstructural, or 3 UTR genes have been also found in China, whereas the mutations were not found in the genomes of US PDCoV strains (Wang et al., 2015a; Wang et al., 2015b) . In June 2015, a PDCoV-related diarrhea outbreak was identified on a pig farm in Thailand (Janetanakit et al., 2016) . PDCoV strains detected in Thailand shared the highest nt identities (\u226598.4%) with the Chinese PDCoV strain CHN-AH-2004 (Janetanakit et al., 2016) .",

Like PEDV and TGEV (Kim et al., 2000) , PDCoV may not induce apoptotic death of enterocytes in the small intestine of infected pigs . PDCoV antigens ( Fig. 2B and C) and nucleic acids (Fig. 2D ) are observed mainly in villous enterocytes of the small (duodenum to ileum) and large intestines (Chen et al., 2015b; Hu et al., 2016; Jung et al., 2015c; Ma et al., 2015) . As tested at post-inoculation days (PID) 3-7, PDCoV antigens were detected mainly in the villous epithelium of the atrophied mid-jejunum to ileum of experimentally infected pigs and to a lesser extent, in duodenum, proximal jejunum and cecum/colon (Chen et al., 2015b; Hu et al., 2016; Jung et al., 2015c; Ma et al., 2015) . Occasionally, a few PDCoV antigenpositive cells are detected in the intestinal crypts . Porcine small intestinal villous enterocytes express large amounts of aminopeptidase N (APN), a 150-kDa glycosylated transmembrane protein, identified as the cellular receptor for PEDV and TGEV (Delmas et al., 1992; Li et al., 2007) . Whether APN also functions as the cellular receptor for PDCoV or if other cellular receptors are involved in cell entry of this virus is unknown. In addition, a few PDCoV antigen-positive cells were also detected in the intestinal lamina propria, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) during the early stages of infection Jung et al., 2016) . As tested at PID 23-24 after experimentally infected pigs had recovered from clinical disease and ceased fecal virus shedding, larger numbers of PDCoV antigen-positive cells were detected in these tissues . The PDCoV antigen-positive cells might include antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages.",

Similar to PEDV infection (Jung et al., 2014) , in a controlled experimental setting, clinical pigs exhibited dehydration, loss of bodyweight, and lethargy, but frequently maintained their appetite until sudden death (Ma et al., 2015) . Among the different clinical signs identified in Gn or conventional pigs, only diarrhea could be observed in experimentally infected conventional nursing pigs (Chen et al., 2015b) , indicating that a variety of disease outcomes are expected based on different experimental conditions. However, conventional pigs appeared to be more susceptible to PDCoV infection, compared to Gn pigs, under similar experimental conditions, such as when the same virus and inoculation dose and age of pigs were used (Ma et al., 2015) . Based on field observations in US swine (Anon., 2014) , PDCoV caused a number of deaths (up to a 40% mortality rate) among suckling pigs, a lower rate than that found in PEDV infections. The clinical impact and disease severity of PDCoV in the field may be less than that of PEDV (Anon., 2014) . On the other hand, a PDCoV-related diarrhea outbreak in a breeding farm in China resulted in a higher mortality rate (more than 80%) among suckling piglets (Song et al., 2015) .",

Functional disorders of infected enterocytes may also contribute to the malabsorptive diarrhea. Like PEDV , mild vacuolation observed in the infected colonic epithelial cells may interfere with the vital reabsorption of water and electrolytes (Jung et al., 2015c) . As a consequence of extensive loss of enterocytes, brush border membrane-bound digestive enzymes such as disaccharidases (lactase, sucrase, and maltase), leucine APN, and alkaline phosphatase were significantly decreased in the small intestine of diarrheic piglets after PEDV infection Jung et al., 2006) , resulting in maldigestive diarrhea. Because of the similar pathological features between PDCoV and PEDV, PDCoV infection may also result in maldigestive diarrhea. Dehydration is exacerbated by vomiting, but the mechanisms by which vomiting is induced in PDCoV infection are poorly understood. Whether PDCoV infection induces metabolic acidosis, similar to hyperkalemia and acidosis in acute TGEV and PEDV infections Saif et al., 2012) , needs to be studied.",

The findings of these studies are summarized in Table 1 . The Gn pig inoculated with 8.8 log 10 GE of the field PDCoV strain OH-FD22 developed diarrhea at PIH 21-24, which was consistently observed until PID 7 (Jung et al., 2015c) .

The Gn pigs inoculated with 10.1-10.8 log 10 GE of the TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 P5, P20, and P40 all showed diarrhea at PID 2, which then persisted for another 4-6 days . Hu et al. (2016) reported that similar to prolonged fecal virus RNA shedding (until PID 20) observed in the wild-type PDCoV OH-FD22-inoculated pigs, fecal virus shedding in the TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 P5 or P20-inoculated pigs was detectable until PID 18 or 20, respectively . The TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 P40-inoculated pig also had PDCoV RNA-positive feces until PID 15 .

            "text": "There is little information on intestinal replication of PDCoV during disease progression in pigs of varying ages. In previous experimental infection studies, most of the infected Gn or conventional suckling pigs were euthanized at PID 3-7 (Chen et al., 2015b; Hu et al., 2016; Jung et al., 2015c; Ma et al., 2015) . Thus, the earlier, pathological characteristics related to PDCoV infection at PID 1-3 are unknown. In experimental PEDV infections in seronegative suckling pigs, during the incubation period, i.e. at approximately PIH 12-24, PEDV antigen-positive cells were seen throughout the small intestine and as many as 30-100% of the absorptive epithelial cells were positive (Debouck et al., 1981; Madson et al., 2015) , consistent with fecal virus shedding in subclinical pigs. After that, during the clinical period, moderate to large numbers of PEDV antigen-positive cells were observed throughout the small intestine (Debouck et al., 1981; Jung et al., 2015a; Madson et al., 2015) . Whether PDCoV also replicates similarly in the small intestine of nursing pigs, needs to be studied in well-controlled experimental settings with large numbers of pigs and multiple time-points. More information on the pathogenesis of PDCoV in pigs at earlier timepoints (PIDs 1-2) is needed to fully understand disease progression. Relative to experimental PEDV infections (Jung et al., 2015a; Jung et al., 2014; Madson et al., 2015) , PDCoV-infected pigs also appeared to shed less PDCoV RNA and had lower peak shedding titers in the feces (Chen et al., 2015b; Jung et al., 2015c) , implying a potentially lower replication rate of PDCoV in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs. Studies are also needed to investigate if this might contribute to the lower mortality of PDCoV-infected nursing pigs, as compared to PEDV infections.",

Similarly, PED is the most devastating in nursing piglets causing 100% morbidity and 50-100% mortality Saif et al., 2012) . Several mechanisms by which PEDV infection induces greater disease severity in nursing versus weaned pigs, have been defined (Annamalai et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2015a) . Compared to 9-day-old nursing pigs that began to show severe clinical disease, villous atrophy and fecal virus shedding at PID 1, a longer incubation period of PEDV was evident before 26-day-old weaned pigs shed fecal virus RNA (by 1 more day) or developed lesions and clinical disease (by 2 more days) (Annamalai et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2015a) . There were significantly decreased functional natural killer cells in the ileum and blood of nursing piglets, compared to weaned pigs, which may have contributed to the greater susceptibility of nursing pigs to PEDV infection (Annamalai et al., 2015) . Studies are needed to confirm if nursing pigs also have higher susceptibility to PDCoV infection. Anatomical and physiological factors that may contribute to the longer recovery of nursing pigs from PED include: 1) the slower turnover of enterocytes (5-7 days) in neonatal piglets compared to 2-3 days in 3-week-old weaned pigs (Moon et al., 1973) ; and 2) the anatomically underdeveloped large intestine of nursing piglets that may increase their vulnerability to dehydration, compared to weaned pigs (Jung et al., 2015a) . There was also a lack of crypt stem cells and lower numbers of proliferating crypt cells in the small intestine of nursing pigs, compared to weaned pigs (Jung et al., 2015a) . This could lead to the slower turnover of enterocytes in nursing vs weaned pigs, contributing to a slower recovery from PED in nursing piglets and the greater susceptibility of nursing pigs to PED (diarrhea and dehydration). Because of the similar pathological features between PDCoV and PEDV, studies are needed to confirm if PDCoV infection may also induce greater disease severity and deaths of nursing piglets vs. weaned pigs by mechanisms similar to those contributing factors to PEDV infection.",

The early, severe diarrhea/vomiting might be accompanied by acute, transient viremia, but no one has yet confirmed the presence of infectious virus in the serum. Similar to PEDV infection of nursing pigs that was accompanied by early viremia (viral RNA, up to 100%), viremia in PDCoV-infected pigs might also be related to the severity of atrophic enteritis and structural alteration of tight and adherens junctions in the jejunal and ileal villous epithelium in the small intestine (Jung et al., 2015b; Jung et al., 2014) .",

The virulence appeared to be similar to that of the parent wild-type virus, as evident by severe diarrhea/vomiting, atrophic enteritis, and high levels of serum IgG, IgA and VN antibodies in inoculated Gn pigs. Our pilot study also revealed that two 10-day-old Gn pigs inoculated orally with 10.2 log 10 GE of the TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 P80 (passage 80) developed delayed (by 1-3 days), but severe clinical signs with high viral RNA shedding titers in the feces, ranging from 7.7 to 8.8 log 10 GE/ml at PIDs 5 and 6, which is similar to those in Gn pigs inoculated with the original field strain OH-FD22 or TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 (cell passages 5-40). Therefore, the TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 needs to be further passaged to evaluate if higher cell-culture passaged virus becomes attenuated, because attenuation of the virulence of PEDV strains has been induced through high cell-culture passages (93rd-144th) (Chen et al., 2015a; Kweon et al., 1999; Sato et al., 2011; Song et al., 2003) .",

However, the impact of dual PDCoV and PEDV or rotavirus infection on the disease outcome in pigs needs to be delineated. A survey conducted in the US reported that of 293 samples collected from diarrheic pigs in the US and Canada in early 2014, 89 (30%) were PDCoV-positive by RT-PCR (Marthaler et al., 2014b) . Of the 89 PDCoV-positive samples, 69 (78%) were positive for PEDV, group A RV (RVA), RVB, or RVC. Co-infections with PDCoV and RVC were the most common [52 (58%) samples], and 29 (29/89; 33%) were also positive for PEDV. Our lab also identified that seven (41.2%) of 42 PDCoV-positive samples, collected on different farms with diarrhea outbreaks in Ohio and Indiana, were also positive for PEDV (3 samples) or RVC (4 samples) by RT-PCR (Hu et al., 2015) . In mainland China, a surveillance study based on nested RT-PCR results reported that of 356 porcine diarrheic samples collected in Jiangxi during 2012-2015, 120 (33.7%) were PDCoV-positive; 231 (64.9%) were PEDV-positive; and 281(78.9%) were positive for either PEDV or PDCoV (Song et al., 2015) . Coinfections with PDCoV and PEDV (19.7%) were common in diarrheic pigs in Jiangxi, China. Another study tested by RT-PCR reported that of 215 diarrheic samples collected in Anhui, Guangxi, Hubei, and Jiangsu during 2004-2014, 14 (6.51%) were positive for PDCoV, 110 (51.2%) were positive for PEDV, and 5 (2.3%) were positive for TGEV.

However, since 2005-2006, DCoVs already had been identified in rectal swabs of wild small mammals (Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret badgers), domestic pigs, and wild birds. Moreover, PDCoV (CHN-AH-2004 and CH/Sichuan/S27/2012 strains), genetically related to the current US PDCoV strains, has been present in Chinese diarrheic pigs since 2004, prior to the first outbreak of PDCoV infection in US swine. Although birds are thought to be the suspect host for Deltacoronaviruses, the detailed genetic relatedness of PDCoV with other DCoV isolates from wild birds and other mammal species should be studied further to clarify the origin of PDCoV in pigs and also the source of the sudden emergence of US PDCoV in US swine.",

Similar to PEDV (alphacoronavirus) infections, PDCoV (deltacoronavirus) infections also cause acute, severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by viremia (viral RNA) that leads to severe diarrhea and/or vomiting, followed by dehydration as the potential cause of death in nursing piglets. Differential diagnosis of PEDV, PDCoV and TGEV is essential to control viral diarrheas in US pig farms. Currently, cultivable, US TC-PDCoV strains have been isolated and propagated in several laboratories. TC-PDCoV strains will be useful to evaluate if high level cell-culture passaged viruses become attenuated and can be potential vaccine candidate strains. Relative to PEDV infections, causing similar, but more severe clinical disease and lesions, the lack of comprehensive understanding of the pathogenic characteristics of PDCoV and effective preventive (PDCoV vaccine) and therapeutic interventions has impeded biosecurity and development of methods for prevention and control of PDCoV in US swine. It is also critical to understand the pathogenic aspects of PDCoV infection distinct from those of PEDV, possibly clarifying why PDCoV infection results in distinctively lower mortality rates in nursing pigs, as compared to the high mortality usually observed among PEDV-infected seronegative nursing pigs.",

(A) Hematoxylin and eosin-stained jejunum of an inoculated pig at post-inoculation day (PID) 3 (48-51 h after onset of clinical signs), showing acute diffuse, severe atrophic enteritis, with diffuse, moderate vacuolation of enterocytes lining the epithelium of atrophied villi. Original magnification, \u00d7200. (B) IF staining of a serial section of the jejunum (Panel A) of inoculated pig at PID 3, showing that the epithelial cells lining atrophied villi are positive for PDCoV antigen (green staining). Original magnification, \u00d7200. (C) IF staining (higher magnification) of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded jejunum of the inoculated pig at PID 3, showing localization of PDCoV antigens (green staining) in the cytoplasm of villous epithelial cells. Nuclei were stained with bluefluorescent 4 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride. Hyperimmune pig antiserum to PDCoV strain OH-FD22 was used for IF staining. Original magnification, \u00d7600. (D) In situ hybridization of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded jejunum of the inoculated pig at PID 3, indicating that the epithelial cells lining the atrophied villi are PDCoV RNA-positive (black staining). Nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromocresyl-3-indolylphosphate, methyl green counterstain. Original magnification \u00d780.",
