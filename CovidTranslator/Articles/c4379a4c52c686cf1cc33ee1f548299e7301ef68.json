Faecal samples from 18 out of 20 Brown Norway (BN) rats, housed in the same barrier as the H. pullorum-infected mice, were positive for H. pullorum using species-specific PCR. In addition, we determined whether H. pullorum was able to persistently colonize the gastrointestinal tract and/or biliary tree and elicit tissue inflammation as well as a serum IgG response in BN rats. Six (four male, two female) 6-week-old, H. pullorumnegative BN rats were orally dosed with 4\u00be10 8 c.f.u. of H. pullorum every other day for a total of three doses. At 2 weeks post-infection, all rats were H. pullorum-positive by faecal PCR. Five out of the six BN rats remained H. pullorum-positive for the entire 30 week study. PCR analysis of tissue collected at necropsy confirmed that the colon and caecum were the primary sites of H. pullorum colonization. Rats that were persistently colonized by H. pullorum had a sustained H. pullorum-specific IgG response measured by ELISA. Intestinal or hepatic pathology associated with H. pullorum infection was not noted. To our knowledge, this is the first report documenting that rats can be persistently colonized with an EHS that also infects humans.",

These pathogens are generally separated into two groups, gastric and enterohepatic, based on their preferred site of colonization. During the last decade, enterohepatic Helicobacter species (EHS) have gained recognition in the field of emerging infectious pathogens (Fox, 2002) . Infection by this group of micro-organisms is generally characterized by colonization of the distal gastrointestinal tract and, in select cases, the biliary tree. As reported for the gastric pathogen H. pylori, gastrointestinal colonization by EHS can be associated with chronic inflammation and neoplasia Garc\u00eda et al., 2008; Ward et al., 1994) .",

Infection with this organism is most often associated with farmraised birds, including chickens, turkeys and guinea fowl (Nebbia et al., 2007; Stanley et al., 1994) . In one report, H. pullorum was isolated from human faeces 3 months following the patients' initial presentation with diarrhoea (Steinbrueckner et al., 1997) . In another case, H. pullorum was isolated from the faeces of a male with diarrhoea and elevated liver enzymes (Burnens et al., 1994) . H. pullorum has also been identified by PCR in humans with inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis, cholecystitis and hepatocelluar carcinoma (Cast\u00e9ra et al., 2006; Fox et al., 1998; Rocha et al., 2005; Veijola et al., 2007) . A recent report identified an association between EHS and Crohn's disease, with H. pullorum being one of the most prevalent EHS identified (Laharie et al., 2009 ).",

Additionally, the ability of H. pullorum to colonize multiple species, including humans, and its demonstrated persistent shedding in the faeces of rats and mice pose a zoonotic risk to personnel exposed to H. pullorum-infected animals (Turk et al., 2012) . To our knowledge, this is the first report confirming that rats, like mice, can be persistently colonized by an EHS known to colonize humans. Further studies on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of H. pullorum will be facilitated by the availability of the H. pullorum genome (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/genome/?term=helicobacter%20pullorum).",

EHS including H. pullorum have also been identified by PCR in patients with hepatobiliary tumours(Rocha et al., 2005).Prior to this study, only three EHS, H. bilis, H. trogontum and H. muridarum, were known to naturally colonize rats. Of the aforementioned, only H. bilis has been shown toTable 1. H. pullorum PCR and culture results in experimentally infected BN rats over the 30 w.p.i.
