The reactivities of the recombinant proteins to a panel of antibodies containing 33 SARS coronavirus-positive sera and 66 negative sera and to antibodies against other animal coronaviruses were screened. A truncated 195-amino-acid fragment from the C terminus of the nucleocapsid protein (N195) was identified that had a strong ability to detect antibodies against SARS coronavirus. No cross-reaction was found between the N195 protein and antibodies against chicken, pig, and canine coronaviruses. The N195 protein was used to develop a Western blot assay to detect antibodies against SARS coronavirus in 274 clinically blinded samples. The specificity and sensitivity of this test were 98.3 and 90.9%, respectively. The correlation between our Western blotting assay and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was also analyzed. The results of our Western blot assay and IFA for the detection of SARS coronavirus-positive sera were the same. Thus, the N195 protein was identified as a suitable protein to be used as an antigen in Western blot and other possible assays for the detection of SARS coronavirus infection. a All patients satisfied the World Health Organization definition of SARS. These serum samples were collected from 4 to 49 days postfever (mean, 18.79 days; median, 14.5 days; standard deviation, 11.95 days; standard error of the mean, 2.26 days).",

Inactivated human antisera were used as the primary antibody at a 1:100 dilution, followed by a peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibody.

The arrow indicates the location of the N195 protein. identification, such as by reverse transcription-PCR and realtime PCR; and antibody detection, such as by IFA and whole virus-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, most of these techniques, such as IFA, reverse transcription-PCR, and real-time PCR, need special equipment and well-trained technicians. The virus from tissue cultures must be operated in a BSL-3 laboratory, emphasizing that further efforts are needed to explore a more convenient, economical, and low-risk procedure. Now, although the SARS outbreak has ceased, the volume of tests for SARS is likely to remain a significant portion of diagnostic laboratories' workloads, especially during the winter months in the northern hemisphere. A test that does not rely on culturing of the SARS coronavirus would thus greatly decrease concerns about laboratory-acquired infections. The sequence of the nucleocapsid gene of SARS coronavirus was found to have 26 to 32% homology with nucleocapsid genes of various animal coronaviruses. To eliminate possible cross-reactions between the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS coronavirus and nucleocapsid proteins of various animal coronaviruses, we sought a minimal sequence derived from the region encoding the nucleocapsid protein which can detect all infected patients effectively. Several truncated nucleocapsid proteins were expressed by use of an E. coli expression system. A truncated nucleocapsid protein of the SARS coronavirus, named the N195 protein in this study, that can effectively detect human antibodies against the SARS coronavirus was identified.",

The probable reasons for this inability to detect antibodies in clinically confirmed SARS sera collected at an early stage of the disease are as follows. (i) The nature of the assay may have caused this inability. After SARS infection, no humoral response to the SARS coronavirus is detectable for several days. This is known as the lag period. This was reported by Li et al. (7) , who showed that 20 SARS coronavirus-infected patients tested negative for IgM and IgG at week 1 after the onset of symptoms. In order to obtain a higher detection rate for the early stage of infection, we need to develop a more sensitive detection method, such as an ELISA, to shorten the lag period, but this would be unlikely for the first 4 to 5 days of illness. (ii) Individual biological variations in the immune system may be the reason. Some samples collected on day 12 postfever, such as those for patient 22 (Table 4) , who was clinically diagnosed as having SARS, were negative by Western blotting and IFA. The reason for this lack of correlation with the clinical diagnosis is not understood at this stage. Some (11, 17) . (iii) It may be that the sensitivities of current serological tests are such that they are unable to detect low titers of SARS coronavirus antibodies. A more sensitive test, such as an ELISA, is urgently needed to verify these samples with low titers of SARS antibodies. Besides the above results, of 100 autoimmune disease samples screened, four nonspecific reactions (for patients 18, 20, 34, and 35) were shown by our Western blot assay. We compared the variability of our Western blot assay and an IFA with autoimmune disease samples: this set comprised eight samples, including the four samples mentioned above, which were selected randomly to be verified by IFA. Two samples (from patients 24 and 26) were positive, and five samples (patients 20, 25, 27, 34, and 35) showed nonspecific fluorescence by IFA (Table 4 ). These autoimmune patients had high levels of autoantibodies in their sera. We speculate that these high levels of autoimmune antibodies might have caused nonspecific binding in our Western blot assay and IFA. We also could not discount the possibility that these patients might be infected but are asymptomatic.",

This recombinant antigen is highly reactive to sera from SARS coronavirus-infected patients, with a high sensitivity and specificity. The Western blot test described here seems to be as sensitive as the conventional IFA technique for the detection of SARS coronavirus infection, proving the value of a serological test using the recombinant antigen. We therefore conclude that the N195-based Western blot assay could become an important and economical alternative serological diagnostic test for the detection of SARS coronavirus infection.",
