This enzymatic process amplifies target DNA sequences with high fidelity and specificity by using the strand displacing DNA polymerases. The product of RCA is long single-stranded DNA that contains tandem repeat of target sequence. Isothermal reaction amplification condition of RCA has an advantage over conventional polymerase chain reaction, because no temperature cycling devices are needed for RCA. Thus, RCA is suitable tool for point-of-care detection of target nucleic acids as well as facile detection of target genes. Combined with various detection methods, RCA could amplify and detect femtomolar scale of target nucleic acids with a specificity of one or two base discrimination. Herein, RCA technology is reviewed with an emphasis on molecular diagnosis of microRNAs, infectious pathogens, and point mutations.",

The 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-end of padlock probes are designed to be hybridized with target nucleotides such as genomic DNA or microRNA (miRNA). The only padlock probe that is hybridized with its target nucleotides is eligible for ligation reaction to form circular DNA templates for subsequent amplification process. Addition of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), primer DNA, and phi 29 DNA polymerase to the circular template DNA can initiate polymerization of target DNA sequence. In addition, branched RCA (BRCA), or hyperbranched RCA (HRCA) has been developed as expanded variations of RCA ( Figure 1C ), which amplify DNA exponentially with forward and reverse primers 8 . HRCA products are double-stranded DNAs (dsDNA), whereas the ordinary RCA products are long ssDNAs. Thus, dsDNA-specific intercalating fluorescent dyes such as SYBR Green (SG) has been often used for the detection of the HRCA products 9 .",

Since RCA does not need thermal cycling for amplification of DNA, no additional devices such as thermal cyclers, are needed for amplification of DNA through RCA. Thus, RCA as isothermal amplification of target gene is regarded as a suitable tool for point-of-care detection of target genes. In addition, RCA can amplify target DNA sequences with high specificity and sensitivity; 1 copy of target DNA in 100,000 copies of non-target DNAs can be amplified by RCA 10 . High sensitivity and specificity makes RCA as a feasible tool for detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 8, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , microRNAs (miRNA) 9,18-29 , bacterial [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] , and viral nucleic acids [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . Amplified DNA products can be detected with diverse methods including fluorescence measurement 8 , colorimetric assay 32, 37 , enzymatic luminescence assay 20, 21 , or elec-tric signals 33 . Herein, we reviewed recent advances in molecular diagnosis methods based on RCA for specific detection of target nucleotides such as miRNAs and infectious pathogens, and point mutations causing SNP.",

The BL assay utilizes target miRNA molecule as primer of the DNA polymerization reaction. During the synthesis of RCA product, inorganic pyrophosphates (PPi) are released when dNTPs are incorporated. Adenylyl transferase then converts released PPi to ATP, which provides chemical energy for firefly luciferase to generate light. Target RNA could be detected up to 0.1 fM through this method, and the luminescence showed linearity as a function of target miRNA amount. Sun et al. also developed miRNA quantification system using RCA coupled with enzymatic luminescence assay ( Figure 2C ) 21 . In this assay, 2\u2032-deoxyadenosine-5\u2032-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) (dATP\u03b1S) was used as a replacement of dATP for generation of adenosine 5\u2032-phosphosulfate (APS) and PPi during the DNA polymerization. The released APS reacts with the PPi to form ATP by the catalytic activity of ATP-sulfurylase, and the generated ATP provides energy for subsequent reaction of firefly luciferase to generate luminescence.

Once the targeting sequences of MBD hybridize with target miRNA, closed template for RCA forms and DNA polymerization occurs in the presence of phi 29 polymerase and miRNA as primer. The RCA product forms repeating SGBDs and the SG I dye intercalates into double-stranded region of the SGBD, which generates detectable green fluorescence. Detection limit of this method was calculated as low as 1 fM. Rather than the conventional padlock probe DNA for L-RCA, Li et al. adopted hairpin-shaped probe mediated RCA (HP-RCA) for detection of miRNA ( Figure 3B ) 22 . The hairpin probe contains miRNA binding domain, which targets miR-486-5p, and circular template binding domain, which also acts as primer for DNA polymerization. In the presence of target miRNA, the hairpin structure of the hairpin probe melts and the target miRNA binds to the probe, which exposes recognition site of circular template. The exposed probe sequence then binds with circular template to initiate polymerization of RCA product. The amplified DNA products are detected by SYBR Green II dye, which can stain ssDNA to emit green fluorescence. Detection limit of this method was calculated as low as 10 fM of target miRNA and could discriminate closely related miRNA families.",

Wang et al. designed a detection method using HRCA targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RNA 35 . They tested liquid-phase RCA and solid-phase RCA, which proceeds in a reaction buffer and on surface of magnetic bead coated with oligo (dT), respectively. Gel electrophoresis was performed for analysis of the RCA products, and both methods could detect single-copy of SARS-CoV RNA. However, accurate quantification of the target RNA was not attained because the detection of the RCA products was based on gel electrophoretic signal, which is insufficient for quantification of the samples. To overcome the lack of quantification, Hamidi et al. developed real-time monitoring methods of H5N1 influenza virus RNA using HRCA combined with colorimetric 37 or fluorometric 38 assay. For fluorescence detection of H5N1 RNA, cDNA synthesis was performed and subsequent HRCA was proceeded by the phi 29 polymerase. SG I was adopted to generate fluorescence signal in the presence of HRCA product. The limit of detection was calculated as low as 9 fM of target, and the signal could be obtained within 3 h. The colorimetric assay was based on characteristics of Hydroxy Naphthol Blue (HNB), which is known as metal chelator. HNB has sky blue color at pH 8.8 with absorption peak at 650 nm. In the presence of metal ions such as Mg 2+ , HNB captures Mg 2+ to form HNB-Mg complex and the absorption peak shifts to 530 nm, which appears in dark blue color. During the polymerization of DNA by Bst DNA polymerase, PPi is released and chelates Mg 2+ in reaction buffer to form PPi-Mg complex. As RCA proceeds, more PPi-Mg complexes are generated and Mg 2+ ions are released from HNB-Mg complexes. Thus, the absorption peak shifts from 530 nm to 650 nm and the color change can be observed via naked eye. By measuring the absorption at 650 nm, the presence of H5N1 influenza virus in sample can be detected. The limit of detection was calculated as low as 28 fM of target and could detect H5N1 virus in real samples.",

In addition, SNPs are known to be cause of cancers 47 and genetic diseases 48, 49 . Thus, sensitive detection of SNPs is crucial for diagnosis of multiple diseases. RCA has been widely adopted in detection of SNPs because of its high sensitivity and specificity. The first SNP analysis using RCA was reported by Lizardi et al. in 1998 8 . Their RCA strategy was designed for detection of CFTR G542X gene causing cystic fibrosis. Oligonucleotide probe was immobilized on glass surface and the probe was ligated with RCA primer depending on the sequence of the target DNA. Amplification of DNA sequence occurred selectively in the presence of circularized template DNA, and the amplified DNA was monitored by fluorophore-labeled probe. Using a similar RCA method but different report system, Zhang et al. designed electrochemical label-free SNP detection system using RCA 17 . They immobilized capture probe, which captures RCA products, on the gold electrode and used methylene blue as signal molecule or detection of RCA products. This method can detect 40 amol of mutant strand and distinguish 1 target mutant from 5,000 non-target wild type DNAs. The SNP detection methods described above are using immobilized oligonucleotides as amplification and signal detection platform. Those methods are expected to be utilized for microarray-type SNP assay system. Molecular beacons are oligonucleotide probes containing both fluorophore and quencher. Without target nucleic acids, the fluorescence of molecular beacons is quenched because hairpin structure of the probes places fluorophore and quencher at near distance. Fluorescence of molecular beacons is recovered when the probes specifically hybridized with their target nucleic acids. Based on the specificity of the molecular beacons, they are widely used as fluorescent probe for SNP genotyping using RCA. Faruqi ",

RCA and its variations were combined with fluorescence detection, colorimetric assay, enzymatic luminescence assay, or electric signal for the detection of target nucleic acids, such as human or bacterial genomic DNAs, miRNAs, and viral RNAs. The detection sensitivity of the RCA based methods are as low as femtomolar scale of target nucleic acids. Furthermore, those methods could discriminate the sequence of the target nucleic acids, even one or two bases could be discriminated by RCA. Therefore, RCA is expected to be an excellent point-of-care diagnostic tool for SNPs, miRNAs, and viral pathogens. ",

The dumbbell probe is comprised with three domains: Loop domain, SYBR Green I binding domain (SGBD), and miRNA binding domain (MBD). Ligation of the dumbbell probe can be initiated by the binding of target miRNA to the MBD. The bound miRNA serves as primer of DNA polymerization by phi 29 DNA polymerase, which generates multiple copies of the SGBD. SG I intercalates into double-stranded region of the SGBD and emits green fluorescence, which can be detected at 530 nm. Image was reproduced from Ref.19 with permission. (B) Schematic illustration of miRNA detection using hairpin probe-based RCA (HP-RCA). The hairpin probe contains miRNA targeting sequence and circular template binding sequence. The hybridization of target miRNA with the hairpin probe exposes circular template binding sequence. The 3\u2032-end of the hairpin probe act as primer of RCA. Thus, binding of the circular template to the hairpin probe can initiate the synthesis of RCA product. The RCA product can be detected by the fluorescence at 512 nm of fluorescent dye, SYBR Green II, which can stain ssDNA. Figure was reproduced from Ref. 22. (C) miRNA detection system using L-RCA, GO, and F-PNA. In the presence of target miRNA, padlock probe was ligated to form circular DNA template. Subsequently, synthesis of RCA product was initiated from 3\u2032-end of the miRNA, which serves as both target and primer. Hybridization of F-PNA to RCA product inhibited binding of RCA product on the GO surface, which prevents fluorescence quenching. Image was reproduced from Ref. 29 with permission. , and discriminate sequence of the target genomic DNA specifically. Schopf et al. reported a RCA based detection method targeting genomic DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Figure 5A)30 . They used capture probe that is immobilized on surface of sepharose beads to capture both single-strands of target double-stranded after heat denaturation. The genomic DNA of M. tuberculosis is fragmented via restriction enzyme reaction and heated for denaturation. The denatured genomic DNA then captured on the surface of the sepharose beads by capture probe. The captured genomic DNA serves as both target DNA for padlock probe and primer for DNA polymerization. The sensitivity of this method was calculated as low as 4.25 fM of target dsDNA and 10,000 colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/mL) for M. tuberculosis. genomic DNA.
