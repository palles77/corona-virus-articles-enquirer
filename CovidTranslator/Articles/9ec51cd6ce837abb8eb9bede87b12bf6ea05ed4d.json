We isolated a highly virulent IBV strain (CK/CH/JS/TAHY) from kidneys of diseased chickens. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene revealed that CK/CH/JS/TAHY clustered with the QX-like type. The S1 gene has 1,620 nucleotides and encoded a polypeptide of 540 amino acids with typical coronavirus cleavage recognition sites of HRRR. About 1-day-old specific pathogen-free White Leghorn chickens inoculated with CK/CH/JS/TAHY at 10 5.5 EID 50 exhibited clinical signs including coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and tracheal vocalization accompanied by depression with 84% mortality and 100% morbidity. The kidneys of dead birds were swollen and pale and exhibited severe urate deposition. Histopathological examination revealed kidney hemorrhages, multifocal necrosis of the renal tubules and trachea with cilia loss, sloughing of epithelial cells, and edema of the lamina propria. IBV-specific antibodies appeared at 10 D post-infection. Chickens vaccinated with a CK/CH/JS/TAHY oil-emulsion vaccine showed 26.7% morbidity and 3% mortality indicating a protective effect. In conclusion, the IBV strain is a virulent avian IBV and that exhibited severe pathogenicity in chickens and is a vaccine candidate to prevent infection by Chinese QX-like nephropathogenic IBV strains.",

IBV is a member of the Gammacoronavirus genus that contains an unsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 27.6 kb. The genome encodes four structural proteins: envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), membrane glycoprotein (M), and the spike glycoprotein (S) (Boursnell et al., 1987) . The S protein is a multimeric coiled-coil protein that is posttranslationally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits by cellular proteases (Stern and Sefton, 1982; Cavanagh et al., 1992) . S1 contains virus-neutralizing epitopes and is anchored to the viral membrane by the S2 subunit and is necessary for attachment to host cells (Koch et al., 1990) . Genetic analysis of the S1 gene has been widely used to differentiate between IBV genotypes and serotypes (Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994; Kingham et al., 2000; Ladman et al., 2006; Cavanagh, 2007) .",

However, its host range is not limited to the URT and the virus can infect the proventriculus, kidney, gut, and oviduct. This spread results in decreased fertility and egg production as well as a decline in the overall health of laying chickens (Sjaak de Wit et al., 2011; Cook et al., 2012; Jackwood, 2012) . There are no effective drugs to treat IBV infections and vaccination shows the most promise for IBV control (Meeusen et al., 2007) . The live attenuated vaccines and inactivated oil-emulsion vaccines derived from Massachusetts (Mass) serotype strains such as H120 and H52 have been widely and extensively used in China (Liu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2009a) . However, vaccinated flocks develop new variant infectious strains due to the poor cross-protection between different serotypes and genotypes (Li et al., 2013) .",

The predominant genotype is a QX-like IBV that has spread widely in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East Cook et al., 2012; Knoetze et al., 2014; Shokri et al., 2018) . Interestingly, the QX-like IBV strains have undergone divergent evolutionary paths resulting in different variants in Europe and China (Worthington et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2017) . To date, several QX-like vaccine candidates were reported recently in China but there is no official approval for their use (Zhao et al., 2015; Huo et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018) . Therefore, there is a shortage of a vaccine against endemic strains of IBV in China and IBV infections remain a problem in the Chinese poultry industry.",

Our results confirmed the ability of CK/CH/JS/TAHY strain to induce both respiratory and renal disease which was consistent with QX-like characteristic symptoms (Zou et al., 2010; Bande et al., 2017) . As reported, IBV replicated in many respiratory tissues such as trachea, lungs, and air sacs and some urogenital tissues including kidney and even in liver and brain (Cavanagh, 2003; Feng et al., 2012) .
