A Biosafety Level 3 autopsy room was available in eight (16.6 %) facilities, other technical devices for safe autopsies were available in nine (18.7 %). Overall, four facilities (8.3 %) reported to have all features explored for the safe management of human remains. Conversely, in five (10.4 %) none of these features were available. Conclusions The level of preparedness of surveyed isolation facilities in the field of post-mortem management in case of HIDs was not satisfactory, and improvements are needed.",

The use of appropriate biosafety measures is very important in case of management of patients deceased from highly infectious diseases (HIDs), such as Ebola virus disease.

Methods The European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases conducted in 2009 a survey in 48 isolation facilities in 16 European countries. A set of standardized checklists, filled during on-site visits, have been used for data collection.",

Moreover, post-mortem examination has been recently advocated as surveillance tool for emerging diseases and bioterrorism event [4, 5] , but it is well known that autopsy may represent a high-risk procedure for transmission [4, [6] [7] [8] [9] . Among HIDs, transmission during management of human remains and autopsies have been reported for viral hemorrhagic fevers including Ebola, smallpox, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [3, 10, 11] , and additional concerns have been posed by several diseases, including plague, SARS, and influenza virus strains [8, 9, 12, 13] .",

This may represent a limit, given the fact that autopsies may be often necessary in these patients (especially if a clear diagnosis has not been established), and represent a high-risk procedure. The lack of written, well-known, and exercised safety procedures is considered cause of an increased risk of exposures for the workers performing the autopsy [22] . Similarly, a better attention should be given to select a small number of selected pathologists, those in charge for performing autopsies in these patients, in order to train them to work with full PPE and to safely remove them, as suggested for other HCWs [23] . Moreover, despite the fact that special autopsy suites and equipments are advocated by existing guidelines to increase the safety of autopsies [3, [18] [19] [20] [21] , the BSL-3 autopsy rooms were few, and the use of special devices, such as those for the reduction of aerosol production during the use of oscillating saw, was rarely reported. In some cases, as in the three facilities that reported to have a BSL-3 design for autopsy room but no specific devices and procedures, results seem inconsistent, since the availability of an equipped BSL-3 autopsy room is not enough if specific procedures are lacking. These data are more alarming in the specific setting of isolation facilities managing HIDs, where the use of special autopsy rooms and equipment is essential and may be more frequent.

            "text": "Post-mortem examination on a subject died from an HID should be done in a BSL-3 autopsy room, with special engineering controls: a BSL-3 autopsy room includes a minimum of six (old construction) to twelve (new construction) air changes per hour, negative pressure relative to adjacent areas and direct exhaust of air to the outside or passed through a HEPA filter if air is re-circulated. Exhaust systems around the autopsy table should direct air (and aerosols) away from personnel performing the procedure (e.g., exhaust downward). For autopsies, local airflow control (e.g., laminar flow systems) can be used to direct aerosols away from personnel; however, this safety measure does not eliminate the need for appropriate PPE. Ideally, these rooms could have a separate way-in and way-out, and a dedicated area for the removal of PPE All personnel performing an autopsy must wear high-level PPE (powered air-purifying respirators equipped with N-95 respirator or HEPA filters, impermeable protective clothing, two layers of surgical gloves plus an additional middle pair of cut-proof gloves)",
