            "text": "In Kivu (Eastern Zaire), pediatric diarrhoea accounts for more fatalities than any other disease. Pilot studies carried out in several tropical areas have shown that rotavirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in children under two years of age, confirming its world-wide distribution [1, 2, 3] . Thus, large seasonal epidemics of diarrhoea are often reported in regions with a high incidence of rotavirus infection throughout the year. Also, in industrialized countries this agent seems to be highly prevalent at times when the isolation rate of bacterial enteropathogens is 1%. Since most of the studies mentioned above have been performed in hospitalized children, we thought it worthwhile to evaluate the role of viruses in diarrhoeal disease in Kivu, both in rural and urban outpatients.",
