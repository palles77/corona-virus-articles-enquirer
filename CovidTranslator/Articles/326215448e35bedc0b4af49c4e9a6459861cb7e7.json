            "text": "Companion animals including dogs are one of the important components in One Health. Parasites may cause not only diseases in pet animals but also many zoonotic diseases infecting humans. In this study, we performed a survey of intestinal parasites in fecal specimens (n = 485) collected from outpatient pet dogs with diarrhea in Beijing, China, for the entire year of 2015 by microscopic examination (all parasites) and SSU rRNA-based nested PCR detection (Giardia and Cryptosporidium). We observed a total of 124 (25.6%) parasite-positive specimens that contained one or more parasites, including Giardia duodenalis (12.8%), Cryptosporidium spp. (4.9%), Cystoisospora spp. (4.3%), trichomonads (4.3%), Toxocara canis (3.5%), Trichuris vulpis (0.6%), and Dipylidium caninum (0.2%). Among the 55 dog breeds, infection rates were significantly higher in border collies and bulldogs, but lower in poodles (p < 0.05). Risk factor analysis suggested that age was negatively correlated with the infection rate (p < 0.00001), while vaccination and deworming in the past 12 months could significantly reduce the parasite infections (p < 0.01). Among the 62 Giardia-positive specimens, 21 were successfully assigned into assemblages using glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) and/or beta-giardin (bg) genes, including assemblage D (n = 15), C (n = 5), and F (n = 1). Among the 24 Cryptosporidium-positive specimens by SSU rRNA PCR, 20 PCR amplicons could be sequenced and identified as Cryptosporidium canis (n = 20). Collectively, this study indicates that parasites are a significant group of pathogens in companion dogs in Beijing, and companion dogs may potentially transmit certain zoonotic parasites to humans, particularly those with weak or weakened immunity.",

Companion animals are also an important BOne Health^component, in which they not only provide many physiological, psychological, and social benefits to humans, but also serve as a reservoir for zoonotic diseases (Matchock 2015; Takashima and Day 2014) . Furthermore, a number of parasite species can cause mild to severe diseases in dogs (Robertson and Thompson 2002) . Many parasites carried by pet dogs may be transmittable to humans, including cestodes (e.g., echinococcosis), nemotodes (e.g., toxocariosis, dirofilariosis and onchocerciasis), and protozoa (e.g., leishmaniosis, giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis) (Baneth et al. 2016; Gracio et al. 2015; Grinnage-Pulley et al. 2016; Tasic-Otasevic et al. 2015) . Additionally, people with immature, weakened, and/or compromised immune systems (e.g., infants, elderly, AIDS patients, and organ transplantation recipients) are susceptible to infections with a wider range of parasitic species, such as Cryptosporidium canis that typically do not infect immunocompetent humans (Adamu et al. 2014; Cama et al. 2007) .",

Among the risk factors, age displayed significant negative correlation with parasite infections (Table 3 ). The chance to carry intestinal parasites was significantly higher in \u2264 6 months old dogs (overall infection rate = 39.9%, OR = 5.0, p < 0.0001), whereas the chance was significantly lower in \u2265 12 months old dogs (rate = 8.3%, OR = 0.6, p < 0.0001; vs. rate = 19.0% in the 6-12 months age group) ( Table 3 ). This observation is in agreement with the general concept that infant and young animals are more susceptible to parasite infections before their immune systems and/or adaptive immunity become fully developed (Abe et al. 2002; Petersen 1992) . Negative correlation was observed between parasite infections and vaccination administrated in the past 12 months before hospital visits (20.8% in vaccinated, OR = 0.5, p < 0.01; vs. 32.8% in non-vaccinated) ( Table 3) . Protection from parasite infections by vaccination was statistically significant, although less expected because the vaccines were originally designated for protecting dogs from certain viral and bacterial pathogens, i.e., vaccination by either one or more of the following vaccines: Nobivac DHPPi (canine distemper virus, herpes I, canine parvovirus and canine parainfluenza virus; MSD animal health, New Zealand], Nobivac DHPPi + Lepto (Leptospira canicola and L. icterohemorrhaiae] (MSD animal health), Vanguard plus 5 (canine distemper virus, herpes I/II, canine parvovirus, canine parainfluenza virus) (Zoetis, USA), or Vanguard plus 5/CV-1 (L. canicola, L. icterohemorrhaiae and canine coronavirus) (Zoetis). We speculate that vaccinations significantly reduced (if not fully eliminated) the potential negative effect of common viral infections on the immunity status of dogs to flight parasite infections as postulated in the case of coinfection of parvovirus and Cryptosporidium in a puppy (Denholm et al. 2001) . It is also likely that pet owners who had their dogs vaccinated might tend to follow veterinarian's instructions more closely on hygiene practice.",

Statistical significance was observed in the reduction of protozoan infection (rate = 13.6%, OR = 0.4, p < 0.001; vs. 26.8% in non-vaccinated) and not in the reduction of helminth infection (rate = 6.4%, OR = 0.6, p = 0.1355; vs. 10.5% in non- vaccinated). However, while we were unable to gain details from the clients on the deworming drugs used for their dogs, the four deworming formulas commonly used by veterinarians in China were mainly labeled as anthelminthic, including Drontal Plus flavor (praziquantel/pyrantel pamoate/febantel) against helminths (nematodes and tapeworms); fenbendazole tablets against roundworms, whipworms, hookworms, and some tapeworms (but ineffective against Dipylidium caninum); and Heartguard Plus or Iverhart Plus (ivermection/pyrantel) against heartworm, ascarids and hookworms. On the other hand, most of the ingredients in these formulas were also experimentally shown to have efficacy against some protozoan parasites, such as Giardia spp. [e.g., (Barr et al. 1994; Bowman et al. 2009; Foletto et al. 2015; Giangaspero et al. 2002; Montoya et al. 2008; Moron-Soto et al. 2017; Zajac et al. 1998)] , which might explain partially the benefits of these deworming formulas against protozoan infections.

            "text": "Companion animals including dogs are one of the important One Health components, particularly in transmitting zoonotic diseases. Among the two common trichomonads (n = 21 in this study), Pentatrichomonas hominis is zoonotic and more common in dogs in China and many other regions (Grellet et al. 2013; Li et al. 2016; Tolbert et al. 2012 ). However, P. hominis is generally considered nonpathogenic to humans (Gookin et al. 2007; Meloni et al. 2011) . Tritrichomonas foetus is less common in dogs and not considered a human pathogen, although it may cause genitourinary infection in cattle and diarrhea in cats and dogs (Gookin et al. 2005; Michi et al. 2016; Tolbert and Gookin 2016) . However, a rare case of T. foetus peritonitis was reported in an immunodeficient patient (Lacassin 2005) , implying its potential to cause opportunistic infection in humans. Among dog ascarids, Toxocara canis is the most common parasite causing toxocariasis in humans. In this survey, we observed 17 cases of T. canis among 485 dogs with diarrhea, suggesting that companion dogs may serve as a source for transmitting this roundworm to humans. Among the other protozoan parasites in dogs, Cystoisopora species (n = 21) are non-human pathogens, whereas some genotypes/species of Giardia and Cryptosporidium are zoonotic. For G. duodenalis, humans are infected mostly by assemblages A and B isolates, but cases of human infections by assemblages C, D, and F isolates were also reported in Europe and Thailand (Feng and Xiao 2011) . For Cryptosporidium species, C. canis may also infect humans, particularly in immunocompromised individuals (Xiao et al. 2007) .",
