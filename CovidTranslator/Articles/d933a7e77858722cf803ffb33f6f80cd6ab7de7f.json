            "text": "The sequence of clone pFC4.2 was analysed for potential coding regions (Fig. 1 ) by the method of Shepherd [19] . This method examines the distribution of purines and pyrimidines in each codon of all three potential frames. Coding regions show a bias in the position of these residues which can be detected by the program, absence of termination codons also has an effect. Predicted coding areas are displayed as a horizontal line superimposed on the position of termination codons in each frame. However the method is only a prediction, and sequence variation prevents perfect alignment between predicted coding areas (horizontal lines) and potential open reading frames (identified by absence of termination codons). For these reasons the horizontal line is not continuous and sudden changes are observed in the frame which is identified as most likely to be coding, e.g., at residue 850. These could be spurious, or alternatively suggest the existence of an overlapping gene. Such features do not imply that ribosomes would change frame at these points during translation. If the underlying ORF is continuous, it should be translated continuously. In the absence of any sequence reported from the 5' end of the virus it is appropriate to refer to those potential ORFs identified in the sequence in order of their location from the 3' end. The small ORF described in our previous report is visible in frame 3 at the extreme 3' end of the virus (ORF 1), and the second is clearly visible extending away from this ORF in frame 1 (ORF 2). The two frames overlap by a single base. The first potential AUG initiation codon in ORF 2 occurs at position 2005 and termination should occur at position 4017. Thus ORF 2 could encode a protein of 671 residues and 73,441 in molecular weight. ORF2 is separated by 4 bases from the 3' end of a third potential ORF in frame 2, which extends beyond the sequence presented here (ORF 3). This specifies aminoacids analogous to those determined by Neill [13] and which are thought to comprise non-structural poly~eptides of the virus.",

Both of these recognized the b-gal-ORF 2 fusion protein in Western blots, but had no reaction with other expressed ORFs or with the bgal produced from a colony which contained FCV sequences inserted in the incorrect frame (data not shown). This suggested that ORF 2 could specify the capsid protein. This conclusion was confirmed by immunizing mice with the ORF 2 fusion protein or with the control b-gal antigens described above. The resulting sera were used in a Western blot. Proteins were prepared from mockinfected CRFK cells, and also from FCV-infected cultures. The infected celt Mock-infected CRFK cells. Panels were developed with the following sera: A Murine sera from animals immunized with b-gal fused to ORF-2 in the incorrect frame (negative control); B Murine sera from animals immunized with b-gal fusion protein expressing ORF 2 prepared as described in the text; C Feline serum from a cat immunized with FCV. A and B Stained with colloidal gold-conjugated anti-murine immunoglobulin and staining was enhanced by silver precipitation (Cambio, Cambridge). C Developed using goat anti-feline immunoglobulins which were then detected with peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat immunoglobulins. The capsid protein cP62, and its precursor cpP76 are marked (4). Lower molecular weight virus-specific proteins, P39, P36 and P27 are also indicated for reference antigens were of two types; cultures maintained throughout infection at 37 \u00b0C, and also cells infected at 37 \u00b0C, and subsequently transferred to 42 \u00b0C at 3 h pi. This procedure allows the accumulation of normally short-lived precursor molecules [3] . Replicate blots of proteins from all three sources were then immunostained with feline serum, ORF 2-specific or control murine sera described above. Bound murine antibody was detected using a colloidal-gold conjugated anti-murine immunoglobulin in combination with silver precipitation enhancement. Bound feline antibody was detected using an antibody sandwich technique, culminating in a peroxidase-conjugated detector antibody. This procedure resulted in greater background staining of panels A and B, compared to panel C (Fig. 3) . The resulting blots show that the ORF2-immunized mice developed antibodies to the capsid protein cP62. The specificity of this reaction was confirmed since this serum also stained the capsid precursor protein cpP76, observed in the FCV-infected cultures maintained at elevated temperature. This effect is not visible in Fig. 3 C because the capsid protein precursor can be masked by other virus proteins migrating in this area of the gel [3] .",

This sequence contains the same pattern of four potential ORF regions as that described here. The extent of nucleotide identity between the structural (ORF 2), and probable non-structural (ORF 3) genes of both strains is very similar; 80% and 78.8% respectively. Predicted protein sequences are even more closely related, 95.3% identity for ORF 1, 89.7% for ORF2, and 91.4% in the region of overlap between ORF 3 from both strains. Modification sites and functional motifs identified by Neill [13] , are common to both strains, and we find that both capsid genes encode a potential ATP/GTP binding site [25] (Fig. 4) . Antigenic variation between virus strains lies predominantly in the structural proteins of the virus. The capsid precursor proteins from both strains are compared in Fig. 4 . Variation between the proteins is concentrated in two areas. The first of these is the N terminus preceding the cleavage site in the precursor molecule, positions 1-121 (13% mismatch). The cleavage site itself, and the adjacent region of the protein are relatively conserved and only 3.6% of the amino acids are different between residues 122 and 395. Residues 396-525 again show increased divergence with 23% of amino acid variation and include the insertion of three asparagine residues in the sequence derived from strain F 9, which are not present in strain CFI/68 FIV (FCV). The final section of the protein is once more relatively well conserved and has only 7.5% variation. Since the N-terminal region of variation is lost during maturational cleavage, antigenic variation between virus particles may be predominantly located in the central region described above. ",

The distribution of potential coding regions is very similar to that observed in a second feline calicivirus whose sequence has been lodged during the preparation of this report. We have identified the major reading frame in this area as specifying the virus capsid protein. This specifies a protein of 73,441 in molecular weight which is in good agreement with the size of 76,000 determined for the capsid protein precursor [3-]. Cleavage of the capsid precursor protein at residue 125 would remove 13,961 and is thus sufficient to account for the size decrease observed during capsid protein maturation. Any trimming at the C terminus cannot therefore be extensive. The predicted sequence contains a consensus sequence for nucleotide binding [25] which is conserved in the two strains sequenced. This is usually associated with polymerase proteins but could be used in this case for RNA binding. The protein does not have extensive similarity with any non-calicivirus sequences in the database (Swiss-Prot release 13). Comparative sequence analysis suggests that the mature capsid protein has relatively conserved termini, but is more variable in the centre. This could suggest that the termini form the structural basis of the particle, whilst the centre is looped out to the surface of the virus, exposed to the immune system and subject to antigenic variation. However, sequence determination from more strains, and location of antibody binding sites will be required to confirm this point. An mRNA synthesized to express ORF 2, and which extends to the 3' terminus would be at least 2,375 bases long. The capsid protein is the most abundant virus-specific polypeptide in the infected cell and an mRNA of 2.4-2.7 kb has been identified as the most abundant message synthesized by this virus [4, 15] . It seems likely therefore that this corresponds to the transcript of the capsid gene identified here and would also allow the presence of a short leader RNA similar to that seen in corona-and toro-virus infections [22, 24] . However the mechanism of calicivirus RNA transcription has yet to be elucidated and it is not known whether such a leader exists. Furthermore, whilst an mRNA of an appropriate size (550 n) for the expression of ORF 1 has been detected; there are no obvious coding frames of a suitable size in the sequence presented here, to account for the mRNAs of 1.5 and 1.9 kb which have also been observed [4] . mRNAs larger than the presumptive capsid protein mRNA (2.4 kb) are known to be present, one of these could direct the translation of ORF 4. Since there are thought to be at least three of these, intermediate in size between the capsid mRNA and the genome, other ORFs may exist between the end of the clone sequenced here and the 5' terminus of the virus.",
