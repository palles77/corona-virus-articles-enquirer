Commercial antiviral agents and pure chemical compounds extracted from traditional Chinese medicinal herbs were screened against 10 clinical isolates of SARS coronavirus by neutralisation tests with confirmation by plaque reduction assays. Interferon-beta-1a, leukocytic interferon-alpha, ribavirin, lopinavir, rimantadine, baicalin and glycyrrhizin showed antiviral activity. The two interferons were only active if the cell lines were pre-incubated with the drugs 16 h before viral inoculation. Results were confirmed by plaque reduction assays. Antiviral activity varied with the use of different cell lines. Checkerboard assays for synergy were performed showing combinations of interferon beta-1a or leukocytic interferon-alpha with ribavirin are synergistic. Since the clinical and toxicity profiles of these agents are well known, they should be considered either singly or in combination for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS in randomised placebo controlled trials in future epidemics.",

Since all age groups are affected and a high fatality is noted in the elderly and those with co-morbidities (Donnelly et al., 2003) , there is an urgent need to find a cure. Prospective clinical and viral load studies in nasopharyngeal secretions from SARS patients showed that viral replication peaked at the 10th day after the onset of symptoms with subsequent clinical deterioration in 30% of the cases despite a decreasing viral load (Peiris et al., 2003) . Therefore the key facet of management should include respiratory support, immuno-modulation in selected cases and early institution of an effective antiviral agent. Such an antiviral agent, if given early, may decrease the peak viral load and the associated immuno-dysregulatory damage. At the moment, there are no commercially available antiviral agents tailored-made for SARS coronavirus. There is an urgent need to search for an agent with a known in use clinical and toxicity profile so that a randomised placebo control trial can be conducted if the epidemic recurs in one of the coming winters. We report in this study on the in vitro antiviral susceptibility of 10 isolates of SARS coronavirus to commercially available antiviral agents and pure chemical compounds including baicalin, glycyrrhizin, and chlorogenic acid extracted from traditional Chinese herbs.",

Among them, only Scutellaria baicalensis, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Flos lonicerae and Artemisia apiacea have their pure chemically defined ingredients being extracted, purified and documented to have antimicrobial activities. Consequently, the main bioactive compounds, namely, baicalin (derived from Scutellaria baicalensis), glycyrrhizin (from Glycyrrhiza uralensis), chlorogenic acid (from Flos lonicerae) and artesunate (from Artemisia apiacea) were investigated in the present study.",

Initial screening of all compounds against the prototype SARS coronavirus strain no. 39849 was performed in 96-well microtitre plates seeded with foetal rhesus kidney-4 cells. Two-fold dilutions of antiviral agents starting from more than four times the peak serum concentration after the maximum therapeutic dose to less than one-quarter of the trough serum concentration were tested in quadruplicate against 100 TCID 50 of SARS coronavirus. A corresponding set of cell controls with drug but without virus inoculation was used as controls for drug toxicity. The cells were scored for the inhibition of the cytopathic effect (CPE) at 48 and 72 h. Those compounds with demonstrable in vitro inhibitory activity were re-assayed against the other nine strains of SARS coronavirus collected from different patients from different hospitals of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Their antiviral activities were also compared in both foetal rhesus kidney-4 (fRHK-4) and Vero-E6 cell lines. Those likely to have clinically significant inhibitory activity were tested by the plaque reduction assay. For selected agents with consistent activity in the plaque reduction assay, checkerboard assays for synergy were per-formed for combinations of interferons and ribavirin using the same neutralization test in 96 well microtiter plates seeded with Vero cell line. Cells were not incubated with the interferons before viral inoculation. Vero cells were used instead of Vero E6 and fRhK-4 cell lines because better antiviral effect can be demonstrated in Vero but less so in the other two cell lines for ribavirin and the interferons.",

Initial screening of 20 commercially available antimicrobial agents against the prototype virus grown in fRhK-4 cell line did not reveal inhibitory activities for acyclovir, ganciclovir, cidofovir, foscarnet, interferon-alpha-2a, interferon-alpha-2b, amantadine, zidovudine, stavudine, nevirapine, abacavir, and ritonavir.

Upon subsequent testing with Vero-E6 cell line, both leukocytic interferon-alpha and interferon-beta-1a were more active and especially after pre-incubation for 16 h before viral inoculation.

Although an oral dose of 1.5 gm of baicalin can only achieve a serum concentration of 0.47 g/ml, intravenous administration of a 360 mg dose of baicalin in human can achieve a peak serum concentration of 74 g/ml. Thus intravenous baicalin should be con-sidered for treatment in randomised placebo control trials in developing countries where such formulations are available and affordable. Baicalin was shown to inhibit HIV-1 by two mechanisms (Kitamura et al., 1998; Li et al., 2000) . At the level of cellular entry, baicalin can conjugate with selected chemokines such as MIP-1\u2424 and SDF-1\u2423, and interfere with their capacity to activate cellular receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 respectively. These two co-recpetors are essential elements for HIV-1 infection and therefore baicalin can inhibit Env-protein mediated fusion of HIV with cells expressing CD4/CCR5 or CD4/CXCR4. Baicalin has also been known to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase probably by interfering with the binding of viral RNA to the RT molecule near the active site of the enzyme.",

This will also reduce the side effects and fluid volume associated with a full course of ribavirin. Despite the superiority of interferons in the in vitro assays, there is little clinical data of its use in the treatment of acute viral respiratory infection in human.
