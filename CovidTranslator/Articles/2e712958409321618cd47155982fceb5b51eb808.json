Small non-cuffed or Cole endotracheal tubes work well. A stylet usually is required to provide enough stiffness for the tube to pass the larynx. Extend the animal's head and neck. Grasp the tongue with forceps and use gentle traction. The tip of the tube then is advanced above the tongue and just past its base. The hard palate is used to deflect the tip of the tube ventrally into the glottis. This is a blind procedure that is difficult to master. Use of a laryngoscope is helpful in larger rodents. Another technique is to place an over-the-needle catheter in the trachea and move it up retrograde through the larynx to act as a guide.
