[8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] There is no licensed vaccine for protection of botulism, although a pentavalent botulinum toxoid (PBT) investigational new drug (IND) vaccine against type A through E is available. 10, 14 The vaccine is a mixture of chemically inactivated BoNTs that were produced from C. botulinum; concerns have been raised regarding safety in the process of producing the toxins, creating limitations in producing a timely supply. 7, 15, 16 To eliminate the risk and difficulty associated with producing a toxin-based vaccine, and alternative vaccine against botulism is being sought. To date, the most progress has occurred with a recombinant H C 50 subunit vaccine. 7, 10, 11, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Replication-incompetent adenoviruses expressing vaccine antigens can be effectively delivered by either the parenteral or mucosal route. The transgene expression with adenovirus vectors is usually robust and can be further enhanced by driving gene expression with strong heterologous promoters. The vector genome does not insert into the host chromosome, ensuring safe delivery. In addition, adenoviruses can be grown to very high titers in qualified cell lines. [21] [22] [23] [24] These advantages make adenoviruses attractive vaccine vectors and they are being used widely in the development of vaccines against HIV, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), avian influenza, tuberculosis and anthrax. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] In a previous study, we constructed a replication-incompetent adenoviral vector containing a synthesized condonoptimized gene encoding the H C 50 of BoNT type C (Ad/ opt-BoNT/C-H C 50) and evaluated its vaccine potential by intramuscular (i.m.) injection. 31 In this study, we use the same adenovirus-based vaccine delivered by the intranasal (i.n.) mucosal route and show that long-lasting protective immunity occurs after a single dose.",

            "text": "The neurotoxins produced by C. botulinum are among the most potent poisons known and there is a need to prepare for their use in a bioterrorism attack. 1,2 Naturally, human botulism mainly involves BoNT types A, B, E and F, 4 and serotypes C and D mostly affect domestic animals. Given the ease of preparation and potential toxicity of all these neurotoxins, it is equally important to develop vaccines against all these toxins for biodefense. In this study, we evaluated the vaccination strategy against the BoNT/C and expect ultimately to apply the same platform to develop vaccines against all serotypes of BoNTs. Here, we have described a novel adenoviral vector delivery of a botulism vaccine against type C neurotoxin that when delivered as a single i.n. dose proved to be a highly effective vaccine. Owing to the single i.n. route of vaccination, this vaccine could be selfadministered to protect the population in the event of terrorist attack with C. botulism or neurotoxins. In addition to the ease of administration and rapid onset of protection described here, the vaccine could be produced inexpensively, in high quantity and in a short time frame. We chose H C 50 fragment of BoNT type C because the H C 50 subunits of BoNTs are non-toxic and antigenic, and are capable of eliciting immunity responses against botulism. 8,10-12 Also in a previous study we showed that i.m. vaccination with Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 elicited strong systemic immunity that lasted at least 27 weeks and mice receiving the vaccine were fully protected against BoNT/C challenge. 31 BoNTs can be lethal by ingestion of minute amounts in food and/or by inhalation. The latter delivery mode is the strongest bioterrorism-related threat. 32, 33 The mucosal immune system is the first line of defense against botulism. However, the current injection-type botulism toxoid vaccine only provides protective immunity in the systemic compartment. Clearly, the development of a safe and effective mucosal vaccine should be a high priority against bioterrorism-related botulism. 34 Previous research by Kobayashi et al. 35 showed that nasal vaccination with BoNT/A toxoid plus a mutant of cholera toxin (E112K) effectively prevents mucosal BoNT intoxication in mice. Maddaloni et al. 36 recently showed that mucosal vaccination with adenovirus type 2 fiber fused with H C 50 of BoNT/A elicited robust mucosal antibody response, and addition of cholera toxin (CT) as an adjuvunt in the vaccine further enhanced protective immunity in mice against challenge with active BoNT/A. These studies proved the feasibility for developing a nasal vaccine against botulism. Adenoviruses invade their host naturally through the mucosa surface, notably in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract. 37 Adenoviral vector vaccines can be effectively delivered by i.n. mucosal route and can induce strong adaptive immune responses in mammalian hosts. 21, 22 The replicationincompetent adenoviral vector Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 studied here given as a protective, single i.n. vaccination elicited not only high serum antibody response to BoNTC/H C 50 but also high specific antibody response in mucosal secretions.",

The protective immunity can last at least 27 weeks and is not compromised by preexisting antibody to adenovirus.

The vaccinated animals were subsequently challenged with 100 \u00c2 MLD 50 of BoNT/C at week 11. ELISA Quantitation Kits (Bethel Lab. Inc., Montgomery, TX, USA) were used to measure IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgA concentrations in serum, saliva, nasal wash and vaginal wash samples against BoNT/C-H C 50 as described previously. 31 Briefly, 96-well plates were coated at 4 1C overnight with recombination protein BoNT/C-H C 50 (0.5 mg/well) in 100 ml of coating buffer (0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6). After rinsing with wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) for five times, the nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 200 ml of blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing five times. Later 100 ml of 1:100 dilutions of sera in PBS (pH 7.4) with 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% BSA was added to each well and then incubated at 37 1C for 2 h. After five washes, the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 ml/well of 1:10 000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG, IgG1 or IgG2a conjugated with alkaline phosphates. The color reaction was developed by incubation with the p-nitrophenylphosphate phosphatase substrate system (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) for 30 min at room temperature, and then the absorbance values (OD 405)were obtained using a Dynatech MR4000 microplate reader. A standard curve for antibody quantitation (the company source) was generated in parallel to allow antibody concentration calculations.48",
