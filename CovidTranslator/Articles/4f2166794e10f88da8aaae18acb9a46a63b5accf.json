DISCUSSION Ron Boot, National Institute of Public Health, Netherlands Q: Dr. Hamm has showed us a wide range of viruses rodents could be screened for or should be screened for. I think to acknowledge there are about 25 viruses in rodentsno. I think it would be unwise and very time consuming to screen for all of those viruses even at arrival of the animals or during experiments. I wonder, and Dr. Heywood has made the suggestion, as to how far oncologi cal values or immunological values could be of help in screening the animals.",

Is it presently occurring in the United States? It was my understanding that there is no ectromelia in the United States at this time.
