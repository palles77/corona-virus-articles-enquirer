            "text": "The use of simulation in education has been increasingly prevalent in recent years and medical education is no exception to this phenomenon. While experiential-based learning is highly valued in medical education, (1, 2) it is limited by patient safety considerations (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) and the relatively low access medical students have to patients. The use of simulation training in clinical education may circumvent such constraints. In fact, high-fidelity medical simulations have been shown to be educationally effective, and simulation-based education has been shown to complement traditional bedside teaching. (8) Most studies report that medical students who underwent simulation training had improved test scores in assessments that measure clinical skill and knowledge. (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) Furthermore, simulation training may be more practical in certain situations; for example, during an epidemic, students may not be allowed to practise physical examination of patients in wards. One study performed during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003 explored the utility of teaching cardiac auscultation without patient contact. (15) For that study, patients with echocardiographically proven heart disease had their heart sounds recorded on electronic stethoscopes. After these recorded sounds were validated, they were used to teach students during simulated bedside sessions. The objective outcome measures and subjective feedback in that study demonstrated that the method was effective and well-received by the students. (15) However, there is still a lack of conclusive research on the cost-benefit factors of the use of simulation in education, and a lack of evidence on the real impact simulation has on actual patient care. (16) The simulator employed in the teaching of the cardiovascular system is Harvey\u00ae The Cardiopulmonary Patient Simulator (Laerdal Medical, Stavanger, Norway). The simulator is a full-size manikin that is able to realistically simulate more than 30 cardiac conditions (through various clinical signs such as heart sounds, murmurs, jugular venous pulsation, nature of apex beat and breath sounds) at the touch of a button. It can be structured to teach students not only common and less complex conditions, but also rare and complex diseases. The main goal of the learning activity using the simulator is for students to understand the functionality of the cardiovascular system under normal physiological conditions and to appreciate how it is affected in various disease processes. The Harvey simulator has been shown to be effective in enabling students to achieve a reasonable level of competency in the skills taught. (17) As such, it has been accredited and recommended for medical education by many institutions worldwide. In fact, the British Heart Foundation purchased a Harvey simulator for each medical school in the United Kingdom. (18) The undergraduate curriculum of the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, was revised in 2008 to integrate the content covered and increase the Effectiveness of early cardiology undergraduate learning using simulation on retention, application of learning and level of confidence during clinical clerkships INTRODUCTION This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the use of a cardiopulmonary patient simulator in the teaching of second-year medical students. Effectiveness was measured in terms of the extent of knowledge retention and students' ability to apply the skills learned in subsequent real-life patient contact.",

The use of the Harvey simulator was incorporated into the teaching-learning schedule of each group of medical students, so as to expose them to core mustknow conditions in cardiovascular diseases through hands-on practice sessions. The Harvey simulator allows students to practise examination of a 'patient' with varied signs, some of which may be rare in clinical practice. In other words, it may take many weeks or months for students to encounter all the same signs (i.e. to gain the same experience via simulation training) through the examination of real patients in normal clinical practice.",

The students presented their findings to an examiner, who then graded them based on an objective marking scheme comprising the following components: (a) student's general approach and rapport with the patient; (b) student's examination technique; and (c) student's ability to pick up on clinical signs and carry out a short discussion of the case. This is similar to the validated assessment template that the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine uses for its professional examinations. The OSCE examiners were practicing cardiologists who had examined and verified the clinical findings in the patient. Each student was tested on the same patient and graded by the same examiner, which translates into higher consistency and greater objectivity in the assessment.

In the examination technique category, the mean score of the third-year medical students was 65% \u00b1 14%, while that of the fourth-year medical students was 79% \u00b1 8%. The fourth-year medical students had undergone one extra year of medical training, including a rotation in internal medicine, prior to undergoing the OSCE. In terms of the combined scores of all the OSCE components, the mean scores for the third-and fourth-year medical students were 54% \u00b1 9% and 70% \u00b1 7%, respectively.",

The third-year medical students scored reasonably well despite not having gone through any formal clinical rotation in internal medicine. They relied mainly on the skills that they had picked up during the simulation training. Compared to the third-year medical students, the fourth-year medical students scored better in the skill sets tested during the OSCE and achieved better overall OSCE scores. This is not unexpected in light of the extra year of clinical exposure that the fourth-year medical students had gone through. Although the fourth-year medical students had varied degrees of exposure to cardiac cases during their clinical postings in various hospitals, the types of patients that were tested in the OSCE were core clinical cases, as indicated in the undergraduate curriculum. During the course of their posting, the fourth-year medical students would have had sufficient opportunities to see patients with the conditions tested in the OSCE, thus enabling them to do well in the OSCE stations.",

First, there was no significant difference in the MCQ test scores between the two groups. Also, in the part of the OSCE that focused on the physiology and pathology of cardiovascular physical examination findings, the medical students in both groups obtained similar scores. This could be due to the fact that during their second year of medical training, the medical students had undergone a Harvey simulation course, in which they were taught these topics. Therefore, it is plausible that that the Harvey simulation sessions, together with the integration of their preclinical years with the clinical curriculum, had benefitted the students in applying what they had learnt in preclinical modules to clinical practice.",

Many stated that they lacked confidence in approaching patients and had difficulty remembering the examination steps. Many also mentioned that there was a lack of patients willing to be examined by medical students. However, with the use of Harvey simulation, medical students are given the opportunity to hone their examination technique before approaching real patients. This may help to boost their confidence during clinical rotations. The use of Harvey simulation also alleviates the problem of patient fatigue, as medical students are given the chance to practice on simulators and thus do not require patient contact for every physical examination practice. Other concerns raised by the medical students in the post-examination survey were the short duration and large class size of the simulation sessions. It is advisable to take these points into consideration in future simulation training sessions, so as to optimise the learning of each medical student.",

(1, 2) The ability to accurately diagnose a condition hinges on the rarity of the disease and the duration of deliberate practice in appropriate clinical settings. While the use of the Harvey simulator is not meant to replace traditional bedside teaching, it is a potentially useful adjunct in medical education, as it allows hands-on practice in a risk-free environment, boosting students' confidence in their subsequent interaction with real patients. The use of the Harvey simulator is especially useful in helping medical students develop the right examination technique for cardiovascular examination. Lengthening the duration of the Harvey simulation sessions and decreasing the class size may increase the learning value of the lessons.",
