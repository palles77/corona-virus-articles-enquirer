Bovine enterovirus (BEV) has recently been reclassified into E and F serotypes. BEV was first isolated in Egypt in 1966 although it has been known in other countries since the 1950s. In this study, BEV-F2 was isolated from calves with severe diarrhea and the isolated viruses were subjected to molecular characterization. Illumina sequencing of one of the isolates revealed the presence of a complete BEV-F genome sequence. The phylogenetic analysis revealed nucleotide substitutions along the genome in comparison with other known strains of BEV-F (HQ663846, AY508697 and DQ092795). Two primer sets were designed from the 3D and 5\u2032NTR regions and used for the examination of the remaining isolates, which were confirmed to be of the BEV-F2 serotype. The availability of the complete genome sequence of this virus adds to the sequence database of the members of Picornaviridae and should be useful in future molecular studies of BEV.",

The Enterovirus genus consists of 12 species; nine enteroviruses (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and J) and three rhinoviruses (A-C) . The enteroviruses are small (~25-30 nm in diameter), non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses consisting of a single stranded positive sense RNA genome surrounded by capsid proteins. The genome has approximately 7500 nucleotides (nt). The 5\u2032 non-translated region (NTR) contains an internal ribosome entry site, which is the initiation site for translation. The genome contains a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a polyprotein (P), which is further processed to yield structural capsid proteins (VP1-VP4) and non-structural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D) (Jiang et al., 2011) .",

The BEVs were first isolated in the late 1950s (McFerran, 1962) . From then on, the virus has been found to exist widely in cattle herds worldwide without causing a specific disease (Gur et al., 2008) . However, BEVs have also been isolated from cattle with a wide range of clinical signs including respiratory disease (pyrexia, cough, and dyspnea), enteric infections (diarrhea, high morbidity and moderate mortality), reproductive disorders, and infertility (Ze-Li et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014) . Zhang et al. (2014) reported a novel BEV-E2 from faecal samples of cattle with severe diarrhea and haemorrhagic intestinal mucosa. Calves experimentally infected with BEV-1 manifested symptoms varying from respiratory illness and moderate diarrhea to subclinical infection with the virus being localized mainly in the digestive tract (Blas-Machado et al., 2011) . In mice, the virus was able to infect intestine, liver and lung (Zhang et al., 2014) .",

The significance of these substitutions is not known but previous studies have reported a high rate of recombination in enteroviruses that can be interserotypic and/or intraserotypic thereby leading to the generation of new strains capable of causing severe disease outbreaks (Yozwiak et al., 2010; Boros et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013) .",
