When most tests are negative, pooling reduces the total number of tests up to four-fold at 2% prevalence and eight-fold at 0.5% prevalence. At current SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, randomized group testing optimized per country could double the number of tested individuals from 1.85M to 3.7M using only 671k more tests.",

We chose the strategy per country which minimized the tests needed at the observed prevalence. This resulted in an expected total of 670,849 tests globally to re-test everyone who has previously been screened for SARS-CoV-2 (1.85M individuals), corresponding to a three-fold improvement in cases per test. Ignoring country-specific prevalence data, 96-well plates and between 5-way and 8-way well pooling resulted in an expected \u2248 780, 000 tests (Table S1 ). When considering country-specific prevalence, however, the single strategy which performed best on average across countries was the 96-well plate (at just under a third as many tests as standard approaches; Figure S3 ). These findings suggests that the 96-well plate row and column pooling approach is a straightforward compromise if no information on population prevalence is available.",

When examining how many countries are optimized by each strategy, however, 40% (24 of 55) of countries save the most tests using the 96-well plate strategy. Choosing the best strategy per country results in a total of 670,849 tests, the vast majority of which are saved by the 384-well plate and 96-well plate strategies. Data from different countries are across a range of dates (3/5-3/20) as number of tests are not systematically reported. * Case counts were not recorded by [15] on the same day as test counts for Turkey, Kyrgyzstan [12] , Hong Kong, Mexico [11] , and New Zealand, are obtained from source and [15] , and are excluded from global estimates. We infer zero cases in Turkey from the date reporting tests (3/10/2020) and first case date (3/12/2020) and exclude two probable cases in New Zealand.",

Positive rows and columns are present if any individuals therein are positive, so negative rows and columns can be excluded. The individuals from positive rows and columns are then tested individually to assess their COVID-19 status. Individuals for which both their row and column tested negative are not screened further.
