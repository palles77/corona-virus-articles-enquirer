Our results suggest that at the broad scale, the likelihood of transmission occurring through any one pathway is approximately equal. However, the major transmission pathways for zoonoses differ widely according to the specific underlying drivers of EID events (e.g., land-use change, agricultural intensification). These results can be used to develop better targeting of surveillance for, and more effective control of newly emerged zoonoses in regions under different underlying pressures that drive disease emergence.",

Nearly twothirds of EIDs are zoonotic and three-quarters of those originate in wildlife ( Jones et al. 2008) , thus targeted disease surveillance may be useful to optimize prevention and control measures and reduce the threat of future zoonotic EIDs (Karesh et al. 2005 , Vrbova et al. 2010 . Recent approaches to disease surveillance and control have largely been disease specific and reactive in nature, tackling pathogens after they have already emerged (Childs and Gordon 2009) . Proactive approaches include pathogen discovery in wildlife to identify potential zoonoses , Lipkin 2013 , however the number of microbes in wildlife remaining to be discovered is likely large and the causes and dynamics of transmission from wildlife to human are poorly understood ( Jones et al. 2008 , Childs and Gordon 2009 . As pathogens continue to emerge from wildlife, a better understanding of the ways through which transmission could potentially occur is needed. Because pathogens with different transmission pathways may require very different prevention and control strategies, understanding the relative importance of each pathway for a given pathogen is essential.",

Pathogen synonyms were included in the search. Supplementary references, including World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) fact sheets, were used to provide additional information about transmission routes from animals to humans. We identified five broad but distinct transmission pathway categories: (1) Direct contact (skin-to-skin contact; scratches; animal bites; contact with body fluids, organs, and tissues; direct large droplet exposure); (2) airborne transmission (via dust particles and airborne small droplets); (3) vector-borne (by biting or mechanical transfer by arthropods); (4) oral transmission (consumption of contaminated food or water); and (5) contaminated environment or fomite (indirect contact with soil or vegetation, contact with water, indirect transmission by contaminated inanimate objects). Where no transmission route was documented, this information was assumed to be unknown, and these pathogens were excluded from the analysis (n = 3), leaving a total of 145 records in our database (Supplemental Table 1 ).",

These drivers are largely environmental, ecological, political, economic, and social forces, functioning on a range of different scales, which facilitate the expansion and adaptation of a pathogen to a new niche (Smolinski et al. 2003 ). The first classification of these drivers was published in 1992 by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). This report identified six factors in the emergence of infectious diseases including: (1) Human demographics and behavior, (2) technology and industry, (3) economic development and land use, (4) international travel and commerce, (5) microbial adaptation and change, and (6) breakdown of public health measures. Seven additional drivers were added in a followup IOM report in 2003 (Smolinski et al. 2003) including: ''human susceptibility to infection,'' ''climate and weather,'' ''changing ecosystems,'' ''poverty and social inequity,'' ''war and famine,'' ''lack of political will,'' and ''intent to harm.'' To calculate which pathways were associated with each EID driver, we split the data into subsets by driver, summed the weights for each transmission category, and divided the sum by the total number of EID events per driver.",

In accordance with their results, we found that when all pathways in our analysis received an equal weighting, zoonotic diseases were more likely to be transmitted by the same two pathways that Taylor identified-oral transmission and by vectors (Supplemental Table 1 ; Fig. 1 ).

            "text": "An important challenge to developing effective prevention and control strategies for zoonotic EIDs is identifying the relevant transmission routes between reservoir hosts and humans. In many cases, primary pathways for transmission are identified during outbreak investigations after a disease has already emerged. However, it is likely that many more novel transmission pathways remain undescribed for pathogens that pose a potential human health risk. The recent emergence of a number of pandemic zoonoses (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] , pandemic influenza H1N1), zoonotic viruses of pandemic potential (e.g., Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS] coronavirus), and those of regional concern (e.g., Ebola virus), in addition to the increasing frequency of EID events ( Jones et al. 2008) , make the targeting of surveillance programs to early stages of emergence a crucial tool for combating pandemics (Morse et al. 2012 ). Our analysis also provides us with insights into which transmission pathways are important in regions where different drivers of EIDs predominate, thus allowing for more targeted prevention measures and surveillance approaches. This approach may have value for targeted surveillance of pathogens that are known to emerge through different pathways. For instance, although Nipah virus (NiV) has been attributed to preferential feeding by Pteropus bats on human-cultivated fruit or other plant products, as was seen with NiV in Malaysia (transmitted via mangoes fed to pigs) and Bangladesh (via date palm sap) (Chua et al. 2000 , the mechanism through which the disease emerged differed between countries. In Malaysia, agricultural intensification led to the planting of mango trees directly adjacent to intensively managed pig populations, attracting fruit bats to the area. This activity resulted in the initial spillover of NiV from Pteropus bats into intensively managed pig populations, leading to subsequent outbreaks to human via direct contact with live pigs (Chua 2003 , Epstein et al. 2006 , Pulliam et al. 2012 . In Bangladesh, the most frequently implicated transmission pathway from animals to people is via the oral transmission pathway, specifically ingestion of fresh date palm sap contaminated by bat excreta (Hughes et al. 2009 , Olival et al. 2013 . By targeting this and other potential routes of food contamination, surveillance efforts and control measures may better minimize the risk of zoonotic disease emergence.",

Thus, effective control measures in regions of active land use change could be focused on ensuring or enhancing vector control (e.g., larval control through environmental management, use of mosquito nets, etc.), preventing transmission through direct animal contact (e.g., use of personal protective equipment, hand washing), and reducing risk of airborne transmission (e.g., use of mask or light cloth to prevent inhalation of infectious agents in high-risk occupations or in areas where land disruption activities are occurring).",

The relevance of these particular pathways to this driver can be explained by examining the events in our database linked to climate and weather. For instance, there are 10 events/pathogens that are associated with climate and weather including five Vibro spp., Coccidioides immitis (Valley fever), and several vector-borne diseases, including Murray Valley encephalitis virus, Sindbis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and Zika virus. Previous work has shown climate-related increases in sea surface temperature and sea level can lead to a higher incidence of food-borne (shellfish poisoning) and waterborne infectious diseases, highlighting the importance of the oral transmission pathway. In fact, recent studies examining climate change impacts on human and animal health found a positive correlation between the prevalence of Vibro spp., including V. cholerae, and increasing sea surface temperature. Similarly, changes in climate have also been shown to affect disease transmission of many vector-borne diseases by shifting the vector's geographic range, increasing reproductive and biting rates and by shortening the incubation period (Vezzulli et al. 2013 , Patz et al. 2005 . Although this finding is not surprising, it does allow us to identify strategies to reduce oral transmission (e.g., food safety measures) and vector-borne transmission in regions with changing climates.",

These results may be particularly useful to target the growing number of efforts to discover and characterize new pathogens before they emerge in human populations, coupled with efforts that identify potential zoonotic pathogen reservoirs and specific high-risk behavior in a region. Our results could be compiled into a catalogue of relevant transmission pathways and reservoirs. Targeting pathogen discovery through this approach could tell us new information about how likely a newly discovered potentially zoonotic pathogen is to emerge. Public health efforts could develop control strategies that focus on behavioral change in high-risk populations to minimize exposure to potential reservoirs and target relevant transmission pathways (e.g., personal protective behaviors for direct animal contact pathway, vector control targeted at larval mosquitos, use of bed nets, etc., for the vector-borne pathway). This approach will allow zoonotic disease surveillance to shift toward a more preemptive strategy and use more targeted public health interventions to prevent zoonotic disease spillover and emergence.
