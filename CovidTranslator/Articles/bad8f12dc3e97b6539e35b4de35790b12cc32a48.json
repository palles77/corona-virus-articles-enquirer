Comparing TIGR4 to PhtD and PhtE-deleted isogenic mutants, a 40% (p=0.001) and 42% (p=0.002) drop in the number of epithelial cells with adherent pneumococci was observed to both cells lines with the mutants, as quantitated using flow cytometry. We expressed PhtD and PhtE on the surface of E coli and demonstrated that when PhtD and PhtE were surface expressed on E coli adherence increased to D562 and A549 cells, compared with the E coli parent strain (p = 0.005, 0.013 for D562 and p=0.034, p=0.035 for A549). Using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy we found that pneumococci aggregated in the presence of human serum IgG, leading to a non-specific drop in adherence. Therefore IgG Fab fragments were prepared to study the functional role of PhtD and PhtE-specific Fabs in blocking adherence. The addition of 1 \u03bcg of IgG Fab from adult sera led to a 34% reduction (p= 0.002) and from children a 20% (p= 0.023) reduction in D562 epithelial cells with adherent pneumococci. In purified IgG from adult sera, the depletion of PhtD and PhtE specific Fab from total IgG Fab resulted in a significant increase in the number of D562 epithelial cells with adherent pneumococci (p=0.005 for PhtD and p=0.024 for PhtE). We conclude that antibody directed to PhtD and PhtE are adhesins of pneumococci, if raised by vaccination, may function to prevent pneumococcal adherence to human airway epithelial cells.",

Risk groups for disease include young children, the elderly, and those with immunodeficiencies (1) . Nasopharyngeal colonization by pneumococci represents the first step in pathogenesis, allowing the potential to seed the blood, brain, lungs, sinuses and middle ear (2) . Colonization of the nasopharynx by pneumococci requires adherence of the bacteria to the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract and this process is mediated by cell wall associated surface proteins of pneumococci such as PsaA, CbpA, PavA, PsrR and others (3, 4, 5, 6) . When pneumococci have colonized the nasopharynx, subsequent viral upper respiratory infection and associated generation of proinflammatory cytokines dramatically upregulate bacterial adherence receptors such as PAF-r and polymeric IgG receptor on host epithelial cells (7, 8, 9) . Since colonization is the initial step in pathogenesis of pneumococcal infections, vaccination to prevent colonization is being sought as a potential strategy to prevent pneumococcal infections.",

Since Pht protein family members are part of a complex operon system, it becomes difficult to assess their adherence attribute by merely comparing the binding of isogenic mutant strains to human epithelial cells (21) . We have recently discovered that pneumococci tend to form bacterial aggregates in the presence of serum or purified IgG (Khan et al, under review).

The results encourage further study of these antigens as vaccine ingredients in a third generation pneumococcal vaccine. Our experiments allowed the accumulation of several complimentary sets of data to justify our conclusions: (1) PhtD and PhtE-deficient TIGR 4 isogenic mutants were shown to bind to D562 and A549 cells significantly less well than the TIGR4 parent strain; (2) PhtD and PhtE when expressed individually on E coli surface showed significantly enhanced adherence to the studied human respiratory epithelial cells; (3) The functional role of human antibody in preventing pneumococcal adherence to D562 cells was established by preparing human Fab fragments of antibody directed to the putative adhesins and showing that human adults Fabs directed to either PhtD or PhtE caused a direct effect of blockage of pneumococcal adherence to the human epithelial cells studied. The complementation of mutants is another method to determine whether a mutant phenotype can be reversed. We used another alternative approach -expression of an adhesin on the surface of heterologous host E coli to corroborate the role of PhtD and PhtE as adhesins. The E coli approach of expressing an adhesin on heterologous host surface has been described in the past by Chen et al (2010) (28) . However, in the absence of complementation we cannot be absolutely certain that the phenotypes observed in our mutants were a direct result of the mutation introduced. In addition, we demonstrated the functional role of anti-PhtD and anti-PhtE specific antibodies to block adherence of the pneumococci to human epithelial cells as a further validation of the role these proteins served as adhesins.",

Pneumococcal adherence to eukaryotic cells of the nasopharynx is a prerequisite for colonization and subsequent pathogenesis in the human host. These pathogen-host interactions are mediated by the binding of pneumococcal surface-exposed adhesins to specific cellular receptor molecules on human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells (29, 30, 31) . Pneumococcal colonization of the nasopharynx precedes the development of invasive disease and is the main gateway of transmission of the pathogen between individuals. Pneumococcal colonization is considered to be an immunizing event (32, 33) , but the presence of natural antibodies may not be quantitatively or qualitatively adequate to prevent colonization. Adhesins from pneumococci and Non typeable Haemophilus influenzae have been demonstrated to protect against infection by preventing the attachment of bacteria to host cells in animal models (6, 34) and could potentially translate in human upon vaccination. Antibodies directed against a pneumococcal adhesin protein might protect at the human mucosal surface by preventing pneumococcal attachment and subsequent colonization.",

All four Pht proteins (Pht A, B, D and E) contain a classical lipoprotein motif (LxxC) within their N-terminal hydrophobic-leader sequences similar to that recognized for processing by signal peptidase II. PhtD and PhtE are 2520 and 3120 bp long open reading frames (ORF) and encode polypeptides of 839 and 1039 amino acids. PhtD and PhtE contain five and six histidine triad motifs and also contain segments that are predicted by colis algorithm to adopt coiled coil information, a feature common among gram positive surface proteins, as well as proline rich regions (14) . Signature tagged mutagenesis has suggested the involvement of these proteins in lung-specific virulence in mice (35) . Among their other putative roles, neutralization of complement factor C3b through factor H binding has been suggested (36), though there are conflicting reports (17) . Proteins of the Pht family have been found to be protective against colonisation, pneumonia and sepsis in mouse models and the degree of protection offered was shown to be greater than other pneumococcal vaccine candidates including PspA and PsaA (37) . Isogenic mutants have shown a reduced binding in the case of pneumococcal PavA in the past but eventually it was found to be an indirect adhesin as PavA antisera could not reduce the binding of wild type pneumococci to cells (5) .",

Although antibody-mediated pneumococcal aggregation could be a naturally occurring protective phenomenon during NP colonization, the role of functional antibodies directed against adhesin proteins can only be established in vitro by overcoming pneumococcal aggregation. Thus in this report we used IgG Fab fragments from purified serum IgG of adults and children to avoid the complication of formation of pneumococcal aggregates in the interpretation of the findings. Our results suggest the need of using IgG Fabs as a prerequisite to study the specific adhesin-blocking role of antibodies in pneumococcal adherence in vitro.",

Similar findings have been recently reported by Godfroid et al (2011) , where they have shown protection against pneumococcal colonisation in mice by vaccination with PhtD and PhtE against D39 pneumococci (37) . They have also demonstrated that the passive transfer of adult-raised PhtD antibodies can protect mice against lethal infection. In our experiments sera from children depleted of PhtD and PhtE specific Fabs did not result in a statistically significant increase in adherence. Given that the ELISA titers of the adults and children sera pools were quantitatively comparable for PhtD and PhtE, we interpret this finding to suggest that the functional ability of children antibodies in response to natural infection at an early age may not be similar to that of adults. The disparity in functional antibody between adults and children has been described in the past in various contexts as adult antibodies typically have greater affinity for antigen, and are more often bactericidal compared to children (39, 40, 41) .",

An evident shift in forward scatter (reflecting the bigger size as a result of aggregation) was detected (Mean Fluorescence Index, MFI= 14300\u00b1405) with 1\u03bcg of IgG [Fig 3a(iii)]. Aggregation mediated by anti-polysaccharide IgM antibody has been demonstrated in the past (26); therefore, we tested anti-polysaccharide (type 4) IgG as a validation of our assay. Similar results were observed when anti-serotype 4 polysaccharide IgG was added to TIGR4 pneumococci [Fig 3a(iv) MFI= 13600\u00b1300)] indicating bacterial aggregation. In contrast, when Fabs (1 \u03bcg) were added to TIGR4 pneumococci, bacterial aggregation did not occur [Fig 3a(ii)]. The autofluorescence (MFI) of IgG Fab-treated pneumococci was significantly lower than IgG-treated pneumococci (p= 0.001).
