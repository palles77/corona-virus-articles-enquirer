            "text": "T he ability of ribosomes to maintain the correct translational reading frame is fundamental to the integrity of protein translation and, ultimately, to cell growth and viability. Thus, the protein translational machinery has evolved to ensure that the intrinsic error rate of reading-frame maintenance is extremely low (\u03fd5 \u03eb 10 \u03ea5 per codon 1 ). However, a number of cases in which elongating ribosomes are programmed to shift their translational reading frame one base in the 5\u0408 direction (\u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting) have been identified (Table 1) . Programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting is most commonly observed in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and nonsegmented (\u03e9) strand RNA viruses; programmed \u03e91 ribosomal frameshifting, which shifts the ribosome one base in the 3\u0408 direction, has also been characterized in at least two viral systems. A few examples of programmed ribosomal frameshifting are known to occur in bacterial genes, and one example of programmed \u03e91 ribosomal frameshifting has been documented in a eukaryotic gene; there are no reported examples of eukaryotic cellular mRNAs that use programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting. These different ribosomal frameshift systems have been extensively reviewed elsewhere [2] [3] [4] [5] , and so this article will focus exclusively on programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting as a target for antiviral intervention. Specifically, we will discuss assay strategies that have been developed for drug screening and recent work in which peptidyl-transferase inhibitors were found to have antiviral activities by altering the efficiency of viral programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting 6 .",

            "text": "In viruses that utilize programmed \u03ea1 frameshifting, the open reading frame (ORF) encoding the major viral structural protein (typically the Gag protein) is located at the 5\u0408 end of the mRNA, whereas the ORFs encoding proteins with enzymatic functions (typically Pro and Pol) are located at the 3\u0408 end of the transcript and out of frame with the Gag ORF (Fig. 1) . The enzymatic proteins are only translated as a result of a programmed ribosomal frameshift event, which occurs with an efficiency of 1-40%, depending on the specific virus and assay system employed 3 . Thus, the majority of translational events result in the production of the Gag protein, while only a minority yield viral enzymatic proteins (Fig. 1 ). The efficiency with which the frameshift occurs therefore determines the ratio of structural to enzymatic proteins available for virusparticle assembly (Fig. 2) . This gene arrangement is important for virus-particle morphogenesis, because viruses require a large excess of structural components over the proteins with enzymatic activities. The importance of maintaining the appropriate ratio of these factors has been demonstrated using two endogenous viruses of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results demonstrate that altering the efficiency of programmed ribosomal frameshifting in either the \u03ea1 or \u03e91 direction changes the ratio of Gag to Gag-Pol proteins synthesized, and thus the virus-particle assembly and RNA packaging, resulting in reduced viral titres [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] (Fig. 2 ). In addition, it has been shown that gross changes in the ratio of Gag to Gag-Pol proteins in retroviruses like HIV or Moloney Murine Leukaemia Virus interferes with virus-particle formation 16, 17 . These studies suggest that programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting presents a novel target for antiviral therapies.",

            "text": "The cis-acting sequences that promote efficient \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting have been well characterized in several viral systems [2] [3] [4] [5] . Two basic sequence elements are required to promote efficient levels of programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting. The first sequence element is called the 'slippery site' and consists of a heptamer sequence X XXY YYZ [the incoming 0-frame (e.g. the gag reading frame) is indicated by the positioning of the spaces], where XXX can be any three identical nucleotides, YYY can be AAA or UUU, and Z is A, U or C (Fig. 3) 10,18-20 . The second promoting element is usually a sequence that forms a defined RNA secondary structure, such as an RNA pseudoknot, approximately six nucleotides 3\u0408 of the slippery site and is thought to increase the probability that the ribosome will slip reading frame in the \u03ea1 direction ( Fig. 3) 21, 22 . The simultaneous slippage of both ribosome-bound tRNAs by one base in the 5\u0408 direction still leaves their non-wobble bases correctly paired with the mRNA in the new reading frame (Fig. 3) . Thus, the number of ribosomes that shift frame is affected by a number of parameters, including the ability of the ribosome-bound tRNAs to unpair from the 0-frame, the ability of these tRNAs to rebind to the \u03ea1 frame, the relative position of the RNA pseudoknot from the slippery site and the pseudoknot's thermodynamic stability 10, 19, 20, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

The first strategy (Fig. 5a) has been used by many laboratories 6, 19, 22, 30, 32 , and is typically used to directly measure in vivo or in vitro programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift efficiencies and relies on the use of two different enzymatic reporter constructs that are assayed in parallel. The transcription-initiation and -termination signals, and the reporter gene in the two constructs are the same in both plasmids. The differences lie in the fact that the 0-frame control plasmid contains the reporter gene in the same reading frame as the translation start site with no intervening viral sequence, resulting in highlevel expression of the reporter protein. The \u03ea1 frameshift reporter construct contains a virus-derived programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift signal inserted between the start codon and the reporter gene, in such a way that the reporter gene is in the \u03ea1 frame with respect to the translational start site. Thus, the reporter protein can only be translated if the ribosome shifts frame in the \u03ea1 direction. The efficiency of \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting is calculated by determining the ratio of reporter-protein activities measured in cells or cell extracts harbouring the \u03ea1 frameshift reporters to those harbouring the 0-frame controls. Because the efficiency of programmed ribosomal frameshifting is based on the ratio of frameshift-reporter to 0-framecontrol activities, the efficiencies of programmed ribosomal frameshifting are always normalized to the effects that drugs have on overall translation by monitoring the reporter-protein activities of the 0-frame controls in the presence of the indicated drug. The changes in programmed frameshifting are determined by calculating the ratio of frameshifting efficiency in the presence of the drugs to that in cells grown in the absence of any drug.",

Agents that inactivate the NMD pathway would stabilize these mRNAs, resulting in higher expression of the frameshift-reporter protein, appearing to increase the efficiency of programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting. Thus, a second, independent assay system is required to confirm that the agent affects programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting and that it has antiviral activity. The killer Programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift assay strategies. (a) General strategy for directly measuring the efficiency of programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting. Pictured are the 0-frame control reporter and \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift constructs. Both systems utilize a reporter protein (the lacZ-encoded \u2424-galactosidase, in vivo, or luciferase, in vitro). In the \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift construct, the reporter is cloned downstream of programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift signals and is in the \u03ea1 frame with a translational start site. Synthesis of the reporter protein thus requires a programmed ribosomal frameshift event. The 0-frame controls have the reporter genes cloned in frame with the start site and lack the intervening viral frameshift signals. The programmed ribosomal frameshift efficiency is determined by dividing the level of reporter-protein activity produced from the \u03ea1 reporters by that produced from the 0-frame control and multiplying by 100%. Translation of the reporters can occur in intact yeast cells or in translationally competent cell extracts. The effects of a candidate compound on both overall translation and on programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting can be monitored. (b) General strategy for assays in intact yeast cells that detect changes in programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift efficiencies by using a selectable marker. A gene encoding a selectable marker is cloned downstream of, and in the \u03ea1 frame with respect to, a translational start site, such that synthesis of the gene product requires a programmed ribosomal frameshift event. Changes in programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift efficiencies are detected by monitoring the ability of cells to grow (positive selection) or not (negative selection) in the presence of a candidate compound. (c) Bicistronic constructs for measuring changes in programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting efficiencies. Reporter-gene 1 constitutes the 0-frame control and can be used to monitor the effect of a compound on overall translation. Translation of reporter-gene 2 requires a programmed ribosomal frameshift event. Changes in programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift efficiencies are detected by monitoring for changes in the ratios between the activities of the two reporter proteins.",

Typically, it is composed of the L-A helper virus and the M 1 satellite virus. The dsRNA genome of L-A contains two ORFs, the 5\u0408 gag gene encoding the major viral coat protein (Gag) and the 3\u0408 pol gene encoding a multifunctional protein that includes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a domain required for viral RNA packaging. A \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift event is responsible for the production of the L-A encoded Gag-Pol fusion protein 19 (Fig. 6a) . The M 1 satellite dsRNA virus of L-A encodes a secreted 'killer' toxin and its dsRNA genome is encapsidated and replicated inside the icosahedral 39-nm L-A viral particle. Changes in the efficiency of programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting along the L-A mRNA result in rapid loss of M 1 , which can be monitored by replicaplating colonies of test cells on a lawn of cells that are sensitive to the killer toxin; cells maintaining the M 1 virus secrete the killer toxin, creating a ring of growth inhibition 10 (Fig. 6c) .",

Pictured are the 0-frame control reporter and \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift constructs. Both systems utilize a reporter protein (the lacZ-encoded \u2424-galactosidase, in vivo, or luciferase, in vitro). In the \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift construct, the reporter is cloned downstream of programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift signals and is in the \u03ea1 frame with a translational start site. Synthesis of the reporter protein thus requires a programmed ribosomal frameshift event. The 0-frame controls have the reporter genes cloned in frame with the start site and lack the intervening viral frameshift signals. The programmed ribosomal frameshift efficiency is determined by dividing the level of reporter-protein activity produced from the \u03ea1 reporters by that produced from the 0-frame control and multiplying by 100%. Translation of the reporters can occur in intact yeast cells or in translationally competent cell extracts. The effects of a candidate compound on both overall translation and on programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting can be monitored. (b) General strategy for assays in intact yeast cells that detect changes in programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift efficiencies by using a selectable marker. A gene encoding a selectable marker is cloned downstream of, and in the \u03ea1 frame with respect to, a translational start site, such that synthesis of the gene product requires a programmed ribosomal frameshift event. Changes in programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift efficiencies are detected by monitoring the ability of cells to grow (positive selection) or not (negative selection) in the presence of a candidate compound. (c) Bicistronic constructs for measuring changes in programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting efficiencies. Reporter-gene 1 constitutes the 0-frame control and can be used to monitor the effect of a compound on overall translation.
