As of October 2018, there were Ebola, Cholera, Yellow Fever (YF) and Meningitis outbreaks in nine countries [2] . Vaccines can address health emergencies; however, only 30% of national regulatory authorities (NRAs) globally can perform core regulatory functions to provide efficient oversight of registration, including the assessment, quality control and post-marketing surveillance of vaccines. This can lead to delayed, access to prevention in emergency situations, thus the need to rely on international mechanisms for product regulation, including the WHO Collaborative Registration Procedure (CRP) [3] .",

Since the 1990s, annual child mortality decreased from over 11 million to around 5 million currently 2 . ''In saving children's lives there is nothing as phenomenal as vaccines\", said Mr. Gates. In this context, ensuring simple procurement practices and guaranteed supply, avoiding fragmentation, working on policies and technical advice for countries, as well as stockpiles, should help drive global and regional vaccine uptake, increasing access to vaccines for everyone. In general, some redundancy in manufacturing is needed to ensure economies of scale and sustainable global supply capacity if one factory goes offline. He commended DCVMN companies for exploring state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies and stated that BMGF is committed to a strong dialogue and willing to share risks that make a difference to global health. Mr. Gates concluded: ''we are looking forward to the partnerships we can have over the next decade\".",

Examples included partnerships with Serum Institute of India (SII) on MenAfriVac, Bharat Biotech on Rotavirus, CDIBP 3 on Japanese encephalitis (JE) and Beijing Biotech Institute on Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) to achieve WHO PQ and supply global markets. PATH relies on its partnerships with industry, research institutes, foundations, and regulators, and success is based on experience and trust. E. Kadilli (UNICEF) highlighted significant progress on reducing child mortality over the past 30 years, with immunizations as key contributor. Achievements have been facilitated through strong partnerships, including with vaccine manufacturers, across four streams of work: procurement and market shaping; supply planning and coordination; country support and sustainability; and strengthening country ownership and long-term immunization sustainability through funding e.g. Gavi co-financing. However, achieving the Sustainable Development Goal targets for child mortality by 2030 [4] requires innovations, including programmatic intelligence, understanding the barriers and deepening insights to leverage partnerships with the private sector to increase immunization rates (Fig. 1) .",

A second collaborative study confirmed that D-antigen measurements of sIPV improved when using sIPV samples as reference. Based on characterization and stability data, the first WHO IS for sIPV was endorsed by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization in October 2018 [25] , and is available from NIBSC for use in potency testing.",

The CRP is based on principles of cooperation, reliance, harmonization and voluntary information sharing to avoid duplication of efforts, enabling faster and efficient access to quality vaccines while respecting sovereignty and national decision-making. Thus far, 34 countries have accepted the CRP. Since 2013, the CRP has enabled registration of 350 medicines within an average of 90 days, and implementation of its principles contributed to achieving 26 vaccine registrations. In 2017, a Pentavalent was registered in Ethiopia within 6 months, and cholera vaccines were registered in Nigeria and Caribbean countries in 3-5 months. Still, there is a need to optimize the CRP for vaccines by better defining priority vaccines and priority countries.",

In 2015, WHO recommended the introduction of IPV, and to ensure at least two available brands of IPV were registered in any of 21 EMR countries: two countries lacked registered IPV and five countries had only one registered IPV brand. The joint registration procedure was legally accepted by the countries for issuance of a marketing authorization (MA), with commitment to no further testing or site inspections before granting the MA. A joint evaluation meeting, focused on IPV vaccine dossiers as submitted to the NRAs, was conducted in October 2014.

[28] The joint industry Regulatory Experts Working Group developed four proposals for streamlining procedures and alignment of dossiers. First, registration procedures could rely on WHO PQ certificates or apply the CRP. Dossier evaluation could rely on batch release data of tests and inspections already conducted by WHO. Registration procedures for non-PQ vaccines could rely on dossiers and data provided by the manufacturing country's NRA, through mutual recognition agreements, or based on release tests conducted by WHO-contracted laboratories (see U. Rosskopf, above). Second, alignment of dossier numbering systems across countries and regions could be improved by following the ICH CTD 11 (EU Notice to Applicants) [29] , also recognized by WHO. Third, use an application form template (proposed in tabular format), maintaining the three key sections and main subheadings. Fourth, consider pre-submission meetings between the applicant, regulators and post-marketing pharmacovigilance systems to improve registration procedures. Dr. Dellepiane concluded that more regulatory convergence practices can improve registrations and access to vaccines globally.",

Closing lecture and concluding remarks C. Nannei and S. Goldin (WHO) delivered the closing lecture focused on the progress and challenges for sustainable influenza vaccine production to ensure pandemic preparedness. A holistic approach to preparedness should include surveillance, evidencebased policies, strategies to deploy influenza vaccines, and sufficient vaccine supply. Considerations for rapid deployment of vaccines in an emergency include regulatory capacity, distribution systems, monitoring systems, healthcare workers' familiarity with influenza immunization, vaccination policies for target groups and communication strategies. From 2006 to 2016, global seasonal influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity tripled from 500 million doses to 1.5 billion doses. During the same period, the estimated global pandemic influenza production capacity grew from 1.46 billion to 6.37 billion potential doses. WHO is developing a new Global Influenza Strategy for 2019-2030 to be launched in early 2019, highlighting the need for sustainable local production of influenza vaccines. DCVMN is a key partner in global influenza preparedness and response activities as an advocate for sustainable vaccine production capacity in developing countries.",

Bar chart illustrates the mortality of global disease burden due to 12 diseases that could be prevented through innovations in vaccines against TB, HIV, Malaria, Shigella, Typhoid, RSV, GBS, ETEC, Norovirus and Dengue vaccines to save 3.3 million lives. Higher availability of Pneumococcal and new generation Rotavirus vaccines could save additional lives, bringing the total estimated lives saved to 3.8 million annually. Bar sizes are only subjectively estimated, indicative of the number of deaths reported in 132 countries. Coloured areas divide the vaccines into three main categories: green = most needed vaccines; orange = not yet available vaccines; grey = vaccines available at limited supply. Improving vaccines manufacturing, supply capacity and availability would save 3.8 million lives. All rates reported here are age-standardised and derived from WHO and Lancet disease burden estimates, represented in a simple illustrative manner, as to data published in 2017 (at the time of the meeting). The purpose of GBD 2017 is to serve as a global public good, freely available for policy makers and the public seeking to improve human health. A detailed description of Data and statistical modelling tools are available at https:// www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)32203-7/fulltext.

The columns chart illustrates the estimated total required supply of vaccines, in billions of doses, displayed in the Y axis. The years included in the forecast are reflected in the X axis (2018-2030). Total global demand for vaccines is expected to grow from 3 billion doses annually presently, to 4 billion doses annually in 2030. Vaccines are color-coded according to the routine or campaign use and vaccine type. Traditional vaccines represent the largest number of doses and are depicted in dark purple and light purple colors, on the bottom of the columns. Innovative or novel vaccines are depicted in dark blue and light blue, represented on the top of each column. Vaccines targeting regional tropical diseases (Cholera, Japanese Encephalitis, Typhoid fever, Dengue fever) are depicted in pink and blue areas. Demand for traditional vaccines (e.g. Pentavalent) may grow the least, while newer vaccines (PCV, Rotavirus, HPV) and vaccines targeting regional tropical diseases are likely to grow more. Note that the number of doses of traditional vaccines used in catchup campaigns, such as measles, are likely to decrease over time, as routine vaccine coverage becomes more stable.

The years included in the forecast are reflected in the X axis (2018-2030). Demand by income group may change considerably over the next decade as many Gavi-eligible countries transition to become selffinancing.

Supply requirements are unlikely to change in non-Gavi MICs and HICs.

The upper diagram shows schematically the strategy used by the Butantan, in cooperation with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), to develop a second-generation recombinant Dengue vaccine. The Dengue virus genome is about 11,000 bases of positive-sense, single stranded RNA (ssRNA) that codes for three structural proteins (capsid protein C, membrane protein M, envelope protein E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5). It also includes short non-coding regions on both the 5 0 and 3 0 ends (black lines). The vaccine constructs comprise three full-length dengue viruses types 1, 3, 4 (depicted in blue, green and red in the lower diagram), attenuated by one or more 30-nucleotide deletions in the 3 0 untranslated region (NS1 to NS5). The nonstructural proteins are derived from type-1, type-3, and type-4 vaccines.The type-2 component is a chimeric virus, carrying virus type 2 structural M and E genes and capsid and non-structural genes of virus type 4 genome.
