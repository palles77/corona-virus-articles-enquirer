Measles is considered as a fever that everyone gets in their infancy. Being transmitted via aerosol, it is highly contagious. It is believed that the majority of North and South American Indians succumbed to the measles that was brought by European invaders during the 16th century. Live vaccines, first developed in 1961, effectively prevent youngsters from infection. Although the fear of measles has disappeared, nearly 10 million children each year are infected by measles virus in Africa and South America, resulting in over 120,000 deaths.",

RSV causes bronchiolitis to children and is the main pathogen for viral pneumonia in children. Syncytium 2 is the major cytopathic effect, as the name implies. For adults, however, RSV causes only mild symptoms, often indistinguishable from common colds and minor illnesses. In fact, RSV infection is one of the most common respiratory infections in infants and most children get RSV infection at least once within 2 years after birth. RSV infection can be fatal, as it costs the lives of over 160,000 children yearly. Despite its clinical importance, no vaccine is yet available. In addition, Nipah virus, a newly emerging virus, is a paramyxovirus (see Table 16 .1). The first outbreak of Nipah virus occurred in Malaysia in 1999 (see Table 21 .3). Hendra virus, another newly emerging virus, is also a paramyxovirus (see Table 21 .3). Hendra virus is now classified as a newly established genus Henipavirus, together with the distantly related Nipah virus (see Table 16 .1).

The coding strategy of the P/C/V gene is extraordinarily complex, as three distinct proteins are synthesized from one mRNA. It involves mRNA editing and an alternative translation initiation codon (ie, ACG codon instead of AUG). Genome Replication: Again, the genome replication strategy is similar to that of rhabdovirus in that the genomic RNA can serve as the template for RNA genome replication as well as RNA transcription ( Fig. 16.3 ). Similar to that of rhabdovirus, the N protein level is believed to regulate the transit from RNA transcription to RNA replication. The genomic RNA serves as the template for the viral RNA transcription until the N protein is accumulated soon after infection. As the N protein accumulates, the transition from transcription to the RNA genome replication takes place.",

As N protein accumulates later in infection, the N proteins, as a trimeric form, begin to bind to the viral RNA, resulting in formation of a (1) ribonucleoprotein (RNP) structure, which then serves as a template for viral genome replication. Second, intriguingly, the RNA primer utilized for the viral transcription is snatched from cellular mRNA (Box 16.1).

The engagement of eIF4E on the cap is the first step of translation initiation. Thus, cellular mRNAs, transcripts of host RNA polymerase II, are all capped and the capping occurs co-transcriptionally in the nucleus. On the other hand, the majority of viral mRNAs have a cap, as their translation relies on host translation factors. A question that arose was how is the capping achieved by RNA viruses, in which RNAs are transcribed by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), instead of cellular RNA polymerase II? Depending on the RNA viruses, two mechanisms are employed. First, some RNA viruses encode capping enzymes (ie, guanyl transferase and methyl transferase) themselves. This group includes positive-strand RNA viruses such as flavivirus, coronavirus, and negative-strand RNA viruses such as rhabdovirus. Second, some RNA viruses such as influenza virus and bunyavirus snatch the cap structure from cellular mRNAs, a mechanism dubbed cap-snatching. In this case, the virus encodes endonuclease required for the cleavage of the capped RNA (eg, PA endonuclease of influenza virus).",
