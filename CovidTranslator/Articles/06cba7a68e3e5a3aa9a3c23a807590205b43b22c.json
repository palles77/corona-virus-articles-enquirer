Immunopathol., In this report, we describe an in vitro culture method for feline bone marrow cells, which yields large numbers of quiescent macrophages after 14 days of culture. The bulk of the cultured cell population consists of macrophages as assessed by morphology, macrophage specific cytochemistry, and phagocytosis. The remaining cells were lymphocytes, bone marrow stromal cells, fibroblasts and occasional polymorphonuclear leukocytes. While resting cells produced no detectable interleukin 1, stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced the production of biologically active interleukin 1. After 6 h LPS stimulation, mRNA for tumor necrosis factor a and interleukin lfl was detectable. The absence of mRNA in unstimulated cells indicates cultured macrophages were not activated until stimulated by LPS or plastic adherence. This approach provides a useful means to measure potential modulatory effects by virus infections or other agents upon feline macrophage gene expression.

Given the interactions of HIV and macrophages (Narayan and Zink, 1988; Meltzer et al., 1990) , it seems likely that infection of feline macrophages by agents such as FIV or FeLV may influence their function, but this point requires further investigation. A practical problem with studies on feline macrophages is that cell lines are lacking and obtaining adequate numbers of macrophages for study may at times be difficult.",

This pattern of TNFt~ and IL-1 fl mRNA expression was reproducible as long as care was taken to prevent inadvertent activation of macrophages prior to LPS stimulation. Interestingly, a separate pattern of cytokine mRNA induction was observed if cells were first harvested from tissue culture dishes, washed and replated onto tissue culture plastic in the presence or absence of LPS (compare Figs. 2(A) and (B) and 3(A) and (B)). Removal of macrophages with subsequent re-adherence to plastic for even a short time activates cytokine gene expression as demonstrated by the presence of IL-1 fl mRNA in the absence of LPS stimulation (Fig. 3 (B) , Lane 1 ). Adherence to plastic may also have primed cells to produce increased amounts of TNF~ mRNA following LPS stimulation since TNFa message is present in Lane 1 and mRNA levels do not begin to decrease until 48 h (Fig. 3 (A) , Lanes 2, 3 and 4 ).

Since comparable amounts of total RNA were loaded per lane (Fig. 3(C) , all lanes for actin probe), LPS activation of an already 'primed' macrophage population (Lane 1, (B)) may have resulted in superinduction of gene transcription with enhanced IL-l fl mRNA production. Alternatively, normal degradation of IL-1 fl mRNA could be blocked, extending the mRNA half-life with consequent increased expression of IL-1 fl mRNA at a given point in time. Whatever the mechanism, it is apparent that even a slight modification in protocol (removal of cells prior to stimulation with LPS for determination of cell concentration versus a gentle medium change with no disturbance of the monolayer prior to LPS stimulation) may drastically alter cytokine induction patterns.",

From an average input of 1.5 X 108 nucleated cells, an average of 2.3 \u00d7 107 cells was obtained at the end of 14 days of which approximately 90% were typical mature macrophages. Following culture for only 7 days, the cell population included many additional cell types such as PMNs and immature progenitor cells of varying lineage specificity. BM macrophage cultures could be successfully maintained (to at least 21 days) without adding an exogenous source of feline colony stimulating factors. The probable source of endogenous macrophage colony stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor which is driving cellular development is the adherent bone marrow stromal cells (Dorshkind, 1990) . These cells are known to be major producers of colony stimulating factors and to play a significant role in hematopoietic cell development (Metcalf, 1989; Dorshkind, 1990) .",

It was important with such studies to stabilize culture conditions since procedures such as adherence or manipulation can change cytokine gene expression (Haskill et al., 1988 ) . In our studies, unstimulated macrophages failed to express either IL-1 fl or TNFa mRNA, but both genes were readily turned on following stimulation with LPS. Since the kinetics of expression for the two cytokines differed following activation, their transcription was assumed to be independently regulated with TNFa expression detectable at 6 h but essentially absent by 24 h. This is in agreement with similar studies on murine and human LPS stimulated monocyte-macrophages, where TNFa gene expression and mRNA levels are rapidly downregulated (Haas et al., 1990; Stein and Gordon, 1991; Takasuka et al., 1991 ) . In contrast, gene transcription for IL-1 fl underwent a different type of regulation with mRNA present at 6 h, decreased significantly by 24 h, but recovered by 48 h. Since actin mRNA levels during all time periods were similar, we can assume that comparable amounts of total RNA were loaded per lane. Our studies provided no explanation for the modulatory effects on IL-1 fl expression, but this topic is under further investigation in our laboratory. We are considering the possibilities of superinduction of gene expression or blockage of IL-1 fl mRNA degradation.",

After 14 days in culture, growth medium was changed and LPS stimulation of cultures begun without disturbing the adherent macrophage cell monolayer. Procedure is fully described in Materials and Methods. Macrophages were stimulated for selected periods of time at which point total RNA was harvested and Northern blot analysis performed as outlined in Materials and Methods. Autoradiographs were exposed for 70 h at -70\u00b0C in the presence of an intensifying screen. Then 10/~g of total RNA were added per lane for electrophoresis. Location of the 18S ribosomal band is marked. Blots were hybridized to 32p-labeled eDNA probes for TNFo~ (A), IL-lfl (B), or actin (C) for 18 h followed by washing and autoradiography.Total RNA was derived from cells cultured in the presence of fresh growth medium in the absence of LPS for 6 h (Lane 1 ), and in the presence of LPS for 6, 24 or 48 h (Lanes ?, respectively ).",
