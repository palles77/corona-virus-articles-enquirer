Similar to 47 chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine decreases the pH and confers antiviral effects. In addition, 48 hydroxychloroquine has a modulating effect on activated immune cells, downregulates the 49 expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and TLR-mediated signal transduction, and decreases the production of interleukin-6 [6]. Although the antimalarial activity of 51 hydroxychloroquine is equivalent to that of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine is preferred 52 over chloroquine for its lower ocular toxicity [7] . Retinopathy is a dose-limiting adverse 53 effect of hydroxychloroquine, but a safe daily dose seems to correspond to 6.5 mg/kg of the 54 ideal body weight and 5.0 mg/kg of the actual body weight [8] . Although there are more 55 clinical data about chloroquine's anti-coronaviral activity than those about 56 hydroxychloroquine's, both these agents are theoretically similar in their antiviral activity [9] . 57",

            "text": "[2]. Few clinical trials in 32 China have shown chloroquine phosphate, an aminoquinoline used in malaria treatment, to be 33 effective against COVID-19 at a dose of 500 mg/d [3]. Chloroquine phosphate also played a 34 promising role in the management of the Zika virus and SARS virus outbreaks. Chloroquine 35 acts by increasing the pH of intracellular vacuoles and altering protein degradation pathways 36 through acidic hydrolases in the lysosomes, macromolecule synthesis in the endosomes, and 37 post-translational protein modification in the Golgi apparatus. In macrophages and other 38 antigen-presenting cells, chloroquine interferes with the antigen processing, thereby 39 achieving an antirheumatic response [4]. Studies have demonstrated that chloroquine also 40 confers its considerable broad-spectrum antiviral effects via interfering with the fusion 41 process of these viruses by decreasing the pH. Additionally, it alters the glycosylation of the 42 cellular receptors of coronaviruses [5]. Hydroxychloroquine (Figure 1), a less toxic 43 aminoquinoline, has an N-hydroxy-ethyl side chain in place of the N-diethyl group of 44 chloroquine. 45",

To date, 103,882 29 patients have been confirmed to have COVID-19, and 3,522 of them have died [1].
