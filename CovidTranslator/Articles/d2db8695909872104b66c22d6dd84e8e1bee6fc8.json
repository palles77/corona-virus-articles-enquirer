The causative pathogen was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (6 bacteria), multiple reverse transcription-PCR (MPCR; 11 viruses), bacterial culture, and serology. The initial chemotherapy was evaluated based on the pathogens identifi ed using PCR. We found 27 viral cases (23.1%), 25 bacterial cases (21.4%), 45 mixed infections with virus and bacteria (38.5%), 10 Mycoplasma pneumoniae (8.5%), 7 mixed infections with M. pneumoniae and another pathogen (6.0%), 1 Chlamydophila pneumoniae (0.9%), and 2 unknown pathogens (1.7%). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus infl uenzae accounted for 58 (49.5%) and 27 (23.0%) of the cases, respectively. The median values (50%) of the white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) using the box-and-whisker and plot method, respectively, were 11.7 \u00d7 10 3 mm \u22123 and 1.4 mg/dl in viral infections, 15.6 \u00d7 10 3 mm \u22123 and 4.8 mg/dl in mixed infections with virus and bacteria, 17.8 \u00d7 10 3 mm \u22123 and 6.3 mg/dl in bacterial infections, 6.7 \u00d7 10 3 mm \u22123 and 1.4 mg/dl in M. pneumoniae infections, and 21.5 \u00d7 10 3 mm \u22123 and 6.4 mg/dl in mixed infections with M. pneumoniae and other bacterial infections.

[4] [5] [6] The rates of these causative microorganisms are quite different depending on many factors including the detection methods, seasonal epidemics, and the antibiotics predominantly used. [7] [8] [9] In Japan, antimicrobial chemotherapy for patients with CAP is begun empirically based on (1) chest X-rays, (2) clinical fi ndings including respiratory status, (3) age, and (4) laboratory tests such as white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein concentration (CRP). Recently, the guidelines to optimize empirical chemotherapy for CAP patients were published. 10 However, we believe the goal of chemotherapy is to select the most appropriate antibiotic for every patient within a short time after admission, based on laboratory results and immediately determining the causative agent.",

            "text": "Identifi cation of the causative pathogens in children with CAP is not always easy because sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples cannot be obtained as routinely performed in adults. To diagnose children, the causative pathogen is suspected from the history, chest X-ray, and blood examination data while taking into account the patient's age, and then the antibiotic is selected empirically. Recently in Japan, 10 the guidelines for the treatment and management of respiratory tract infection in pediatric patients have been proposed to promote optimal chemotherapy, and similar guidelines are found in other countries. 25, 26 However, the incidence rate of pathogenic microorganisms in pediatric CAP in other countries likely differs due to many factors such as the health insurance system, vaccination programs, kinds of antibiotics predominantly used, and population density. There are published studies of the use of PCR methods to determine the pathogens in CAP, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] and the simultaneous detection of both bacteria and viruses is expected to enhance the accuracy of CAP diagnosis. Here our aim was to identify bacteria and viruses using PCR within a short time frame and to evaluate the PCR results in relation to clinical fi ndings. As previously described, 17 DNA/RNA samples were extracted from clini- In the near future, it is anticipated we will also be able to accomplish viral identifi cation with real-time PCR. We used nasopharyngeal samples as a source to identify the causative pathogens. These materials are appropriate to identify viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, but this sample type is questionable for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus infl uenzae because they can be present in normal individuals. A positive result for S. pneumoniae and H. infl uenzae by real-time PCR should be carefully considered as to whether it indicates their causal relation with the infection or not where the physician should consider the chest X-rays, clinical symptoms, clinical laboratory fi ndings such as WBC and CRP, bacterial amounts, and infl ammation fi ndings of leucocytes in nasopharyngeal samples.",

In clinical practice, we have observed these values do not fl uctuate for about half a day after the onset of bacterial infection. In addition, in the cases of adenovirus infection, and virus or M. pneumoniae infection in school-age children, the values of WBC and CRP are relatively high. The physician must be mindful of these kinds of exceptional cases; however, as shown in our data, signifi cant differences in these values are found and are correlated to the causative pathogens. At present, we believe the time from onset to presentation in hospital is relatively uniform in Japan as compared with other countries because of our universal health insurance system.",
