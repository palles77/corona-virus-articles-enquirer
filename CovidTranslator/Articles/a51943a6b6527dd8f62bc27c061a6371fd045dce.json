The transition temperature of the RBD in a mixing buffer, composed of glycine, sodium acetate, and sodium phosphate with 100 mM sodium chloride, at pH 6.8, determined by differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism, is 48.74 C. Experimental results showed that the thermal-induced unfolding-folding transition of the RBD follows a two-state model with a reversibility >90%. Using a simple G o-like model and Langevin dynamics we have shown that, in agreement with our experiments, the folding of the RBD is two-state. Theoretical estimates of thermodynamic quantities are in reasonable agreement with the experiments. Folding and thermal unfolding pathways of the RBD also were experimentally and numerically studied in detail. It was shown that the strand b 1 from the N-terminal folds last and unfolds first, while the remaining b-strands fold/unfold cooperatively.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP) is a major virion structural protein in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (1, 2) . It has 422 amino-acid residues, a molecular weight of 46 kDa, and shares 20-30% homology with the NP of other coronaviruses (1, 2) . Its major function is to assemble the viral RNA genome of coronavirus to form the helical ribonucleoprotein core. In vitro, the NPs, in the absence of genomic nucleic acid, exist as dimers at a low concentration, and may form higher oligomers at higher concentrations (3) . The NP does not have any cysteine residues, thus it contains no disulfide bond, and may be less stable than other structural proteins of SARS-CoV. Experiments showed that it is most stable at pH 9.0 (3). Thermal and chemical denaturant-induced denaturation analysis (3) showed that the unfolding and refolding of oligomeric NP can be described by a two-state model. Chemical unfolding is found to be reversible (3, 4) , while both irreversibility (3) and reversibility (4) of the thermal-induced unfolding in different buffers have been reported. Recently, Wang et al. (4) reported that the NP in phosphate-buffered saline buffer starts to unfold at 35 C and is completely denatured at 55 C. The stability of the NP is critical for the function of the SARS virus, which is completely noninfectious at~56 C (5) .",

            "text": "Quite recently, Chang et al. (6) found that the NP consists of two independent structural domains-the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD) (residues 45-181) and the C-terminal dimerization domain (DD) (residues 248-365), surrounded by flexible linkers. Fig. 1 shows a model for the overall structure of SARS-CoV NP (6) . The two structural domains carry out two distinct functions. The N-terminal domain is able to bind RNA, while the C-terminal domain acts as a dimerization domain. Hsieh et al. (7) showed that the DD could also bind to an RNA packing signal, and Chen et al. (8) proposed an octamer model (note that the structure of the octamer can be accessed at the Protein Data Bank, PDB code: 2CJR) to demonstrate a possible framework for helical packing of viral RNA. Whereas the two structural domains do not interact with each other, they could act in concert to carry out biological functions with the aid of the long flexible linker between the two domains (6) . In this context, two structural domains are logical candidates for further studies. We then investigated the thermostability of the two domains separately, instead of using the full-length of the NP. In this article, we focus on studying the RBD, and the study of the DD domain will be reported elsewhere.",

The reversibility of thermal folding of RBD was theoretically investigated by considering folding and unfolding pathways of five b-strands. The results are substantially congruent with the experimental results, while the folding of b-strands is less cooperative.",

The fragment was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells overnight at 37 C in Luria-Broth media without inducing agents. For purification, 10 amino-acid residues (MHHHHHHAMG) have been added to the N-terminal of RBD as Histag, such that the final RBD sample has a total of 147 amino-acid residues, in which residues 11-147 correspond to residues 45-181 of the SARS-CoV NP. The protein was purified with Ni-NTA affinity column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 7 M urea. The protein was then allowed to refold by gradually lowering the denaturant concentration through dialysis in liquid chromatography buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% NaN 3 , pH 7.4).

Increased tumbling of the molecule results in stronger peak intensities, whereas increased exchange rate lowers the intensities. When the temperature is raised, both the tumbling rate and exchange rates increase. Residues that are involved in hydrogen bonding, e.g., secondary structure formation, usually have slower exchange rates and are less prone to lose intensity when the temperature is raised. Thus, a plot of peak intensities versus temperature provides a qualitative view of the (un)folding process under equilibrium conditions. Such a plot for the RBD is shown in Fig. 6 for the b-sheet residues. The residues comprising the b-sheet fall into three categories: Q59 (numbered according to the full length of NP), which shows extreme loss of intensity even at moderate temperatures; T58 and Y110, which lose intensity at an intermediate rate; and the rest, which lose intensity only at higher temperatures. Our results suggest that the b 1 strand, which includes T58 and Q59, has a lower thermal stability compared to the other strands in the b-sheet. Thus, the strand b 1 likely unfolds first and folds last in the (un)folding process. The fact that most residues exhibit a transition at approximately the same temperature implies a high degree of cooperativity of the (un)folding process. Another way to analyze secondary structures is through the use of secondary shifts, which is defined as the difference between the observed chemical shift and the average random-coil chemical shift. This approach requires tripleresonance NMR experiments. We opted to observe only the carbonyl shifts because it employs a highly sensitive experiment and is sensitive to both the aand b-structures. Positive values imply a-propensity, whereas negative values imply b-propensity. We carried out this experiment at three different temperatures with the results summarized in Fig. 6 . Attempts to conduct the experiments at higher temperature were not feasible due to low signal/noise ratio.",

Since two minima, which correspond to the denaturated and folded states, are separated by only one transition state, the RBD is a two-state folder. This is in qualitative agreement with our experimental finding. However, some remarks are in order. First, the two-state behavior is obvious for the b-protein RBD. Second, the all-or-none folding of the RBD is not a mere consequence of G o modeling, because this model correctly captures not only the two-state folding of proteins CI2 and SH3 (more two-state G o folders may be found in (33)) but also intermediates of the three-state folder barnase, RNase H, and CheY (14) . The reason for this is that the simple G o model ignores the energetic frustration but it still takes the topological frustration into account. Therefore, it can capture intermediates that occur due to topological constraints but not those emerging from the frustration of the contact interactions. The fact that the simple G o model correctly captures the two-state behavior as was observed in our experiments, suggests that the energetic frustration ignored in this model plays a minor role compared to the topological frustration (14) . Even though the G o model by itself cannot be employed to ascertain the two-state behavior of proteins, one can use it in conjunction with experimental methods. Biophysical Journal 96(5) 1892-1901",

Our detailed analysis shows that strand b 1 , e.g., unfolds first in 48% of events (Eq. 9), while b 5 and b 4 unfold first in 42% and 10% of events, respectively. Comparing Eq. 8 and Eq. 9, one can see that in terms of strand pairs, the unfolding is the reverse of folding. In this sense, our simulations capture the experimental fact that the folding of the RBD is highly reversible. However, it is not entirely true if one considers individual strands. In fact, assuming that the thermal unfolding is reverse of folding, then from Eq. 8 it would follow that strand b 2 unfolds last, but b 4 is supposed to unfold last according to Eq. 9. Notably, Eq. 8 and Eq. 9 unambiguously show that statistically b 1 folds last at low temperatures, and it unfolds first at high temperatures. These results are congruent with the experimental results.",

We find that even though the thermalinduced unfolding of the full-length NP is irreversible in the same buffer condition in our DSC measurements (results not shown), the RBD is a highly reversible segment. The transition midpoint is determined to be 48.74 C located in the range of the unfolding temperature of the NP (35-55 C with a T M of 43 C (4)). The thermal unfolding of the fulllength NP was studied by fluorescence technique that monitors primarily the structural changes at the vicinities of the five tryptophan residues, three located in the RBD domain and two in the DD domain. Thus, the results are the composite effects of the melting of the two domains and as such, the observed melting is broad. The observed lower T M for the NP also suggests that the DD appears to be less stable and more crucial to the properties of the NP, and predominantly determines the stability of the framework of the DD octamer (8) in forming helical ribonucleoprotein core. The RBD and DD do not interact with each other. It is unclear how the two domains contribute to the high irreversibility. This issue requires further investigation.",

The G o model by itself can not be employed to ascertain the two-state behavior of proteins. However, one can use it in conjunction with experiments to probe the two-state folding because this model does not always provide the two-state behavior as have been clearly shown in the work of Clementi et al. (14) . It can capture intermediates that occur due to topological constraints but not those emerging from the frustration of the contact interactions. Although the folding process in the G o model is less cooperative compared to what observed experimentally, we have obtained good estimates for other thermodynamic quantities. Given the simplicity of the G o modeling, our theoretical results should be considered as reasonable. In the future, it is of interest to simulate RBD with all-atom models (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) to see whether such simulated results can be more cooperative. In addition, our present simulations show that the folding of the RBD initiates from the core and the N-terminus folds last. Our NMR spectroscopy experiment conducted under equilibrium conditions suggests that the N-terminus unfolds first and folds last, while the (un)folding of remaining b-strands is highly cooperative. Due to the sensitivity of the solution pH and hydrogen exchange rate with respect to temperature variations, our analysis based on the NMR data for the folding sequence of the remaining four b-strands has a limited resolution.",
