Despite reports of more sensitive serological tests, it was several years before these methods were generally used in rodent virus serology laboratories. Both the conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect imunofluorescence (IFA) test were shown to be significantly more sensitive than the CF test for detection of antibody to MHV (Peters et al., 1979; Boorman et al., 1982; Smith, 1983) . A commercially available ELISA kit was somewhat less sensitive than IFA for detection of MHV antibody in sera of experimentally infected mice (Smith, 1983) .",

            "text": "The close antigenic relationship between MHV and the sialodacryodenitis (SDAV)rat coronavirus (RCV) complex allowed the use of MHV antigen as substrate for detection of antibody to these rat coronaviruses. The ELISA and IFA tests using MHV antigen were more sensitive than the CF or neutralization test 0166-0934/86/$03.50 0 1986 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. (Biomedical Division) using homologous antigen for detection of antibody to these agents (Peters and Collins, 1983; Smith, 1983) . The ability of MHV antigen to detect antibody to SDAV/RCV was fortunate, since growth of SDAV/RCV in cell culture has, until recently, been limited to primary rat kidney cells (Hirano et al., 1985) . IFA has been successfully used in this laboratory for the serodiagnosis of rodent coronavirus infection among both naturally and experimentally infected animals (Smith, 1983; Smith, 1986) . IFA is easier to interpret than some other serological tests because cells reactive with antibody are viewed directly. Since MHV induces syncytia formation in infected cells, fluorescence in syncytial cells is one good indicator of specificity of reactions. IFA is, however, labor intensive in the case of pathogenesis experiments or other studies involving large numbers of animals and requiring tests of multiple antibody dilutions to determine titers. For such large scale testing, a more automated assay such as the ELISA is preferable. For the conventional ELISA, we have found it necessary to purify MHV antigen used to coat the solid phase in order to eliminate nonspecific reactivity. Such purification requires equipment that may be beyond the financial means of some laboratories. In addition, it may be difficult to obtain identical antigen concentrations for different batches of antigen. This is an important consideration if sensitivity of a diagnostic test is to be standardized. Lastly, the ability to inactivate the test antigen is desirable for laboratories in close proximity to animal quarters. Compounds such as psoralen and beta propiolactone may be used, or antigen may be irradiated. These procedures may also require expensive equipment.",

Both EIAs were somewhat more sensitive than IFA in their ability to detect antibody in sera of SJL/J mice. Two of eight mice tested on day 10 were antibody-positive in both EIAs, whereas all eight were seronegative based on the IFA test. The EIAs detected the same seropositive mice as IFA on post-inoculation day 20, but antibody titers were significantly higher in the HRP EIA than in the IFA test. The ability of the HRP and ureiase assays to detect antibody to heterologous as well as homologous viruses was then further assessed (Table 4 ). Both enzyme immunoassays were more sensitive than IFA. Antibody titers were 4-to 64-fold higher in the HRP EIA than in the IFA test. Titers in the ureiase EIA were 4-to 256fold higher than in the IFA test. For MHV-A59 and SDAV antibody preparations, ureiase assay titers were 4-fold higher than HRP titers.",
