Quantitative real-time PCR was not performed because of limited applicability due to inherent variability in respiratory sample collection. The presence of MCPyV in samples positive by real-time PCR was then confi rmed by using partial large T antigen (LT3) and major capsid protein (VP1) conventional MCPyV detection PCR assays of Feng et al. (3) . All PCRs were performed in a unidirectional workfl ow through dedicated suites for reagent preparation, PCR setup, and amplifi cation. Ten random real-time PCR-negative samples, 10 water control samples, and template-negative control samples were used to exclude amplicon or sample cross-contamination. A clinical sample that was positive for MCPvV by all 3 assays and confi rmed by sequencing was used as a positive control for all PCRs.",

Of these, 8 (1.5%) could be confi rmed by only 1 conventional PCR, and 7 (1.3%) yielded positive results in all 3 MCPyV PCRs. All positive detections were in NPA samples. This variation in detection rates could have been due to the unforeseen nonspecifi city of the real-time PCR, or to the inherent lower sensitivity of conventional PCRs, because most real-time PCR-positive samples produced late signals at cycle threshold values \u224840. We chose a conservative algorithm, in which a sample must have been positive in all 3 assays to be considered a true positive.

These PyVs may be merely transmitted through the respiratory route or detected during periods of reactivation (9) . Similarly, JC and BK PyVs are suspected of being transmitted by inhalation and are occasionally detected in respiratory samples, yet patients generally remain asymptomatic or exhibit nonspecifi c upper respiratory tract symptoms (10, 11) . Like these other PyVs, MCPyV may potentially be transmitted through the respiratory route and become latent in other sites, such as epidermal tissue, by systemic spread, in a similar fashion to murine PyV (12) . Clearly, further studies using larger sample populations, expanded respiratory pathogen detection methods, and control groups are needed to elucidate what role, if any, MCPyV plays in upper and lower respiratory tract illness.",

Sequence data from positive specimens indicate that MCPyV found in respiratory secretions is similar to the viruses identifi ed within Merkel cell carcinomas. Whether and how the virus is translated from the respiratory tract to skin cells, if it is able to be transported systemically, and its role in the malignant transformation of Merkel cells are all questions worthy of further investigation.
