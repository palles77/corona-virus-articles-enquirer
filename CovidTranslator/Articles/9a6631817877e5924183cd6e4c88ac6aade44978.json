At present, research showed that the disease was mainly transmitted by the droplet in respiratory tract and mucosa [1 5] . According to the experience in controlling infectious disease, vaccination would be the most effective measure to prevent the epidemic of SARS [6 9] .

Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV BJ01 strain and incubated in serum-free medium, 5 mL per bottle, at 37 for 36 h.

The supernatant was harvested, added with 1 2000 dilutedpropiolactone (Sigma), shaken up and incubated at 4 for 24-72 h.

Each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The harvested viruses were pooled and further concentrated by centrifugation using Centriplus-20. The total protein content of the sample before and after chromatography was measured by Lowry method. 1% human albumin as a stabilizer and 0.01% thimerosal as an antiseptic were added to the purified virus. Samples taken from the purified virus were examined by electron microscopy, Western blotting, ELISA and mass spectrographic analysis. The dosage of antigen was finally adjusted with PBS. To prepare the pure antigen containing aluminum hydroxide adjuvant, the following procedures were adopted: aluminum hydroxide (National Vaccine and Serum Institute) was added to antigen solution to a final concentration of 0.6 mg/mL, shaken for 1 h at 4 to make the antigen adsorbed onto the adjuvant completely.",

As shown in Fig. 1 , two peaks appeared on Sepharose 4FF chromatogram. By electron-microscopic inspection viral particles of about 100 nm with typical corona spikes could be observed in elute of the first peak ( Fig. 2) while there were not similar particles in elute of the second. Therefore SARS-CoV appeared in the first peak and other macro-proteins in the second peak. All fractions containing SARS virus were pooled and condensed with Centriplus-20 for the preparation of inactivated vaccine of SARS-COV. -propiolactone was employed to inactivate the virus at 4 with a ratio of 1 2000 or 1 4000. Samples were taken after 20, 24, 28, 42, 48, 66 and 72 h of inactivation respectively and put at 37 for 2 h to hydrolyze -propiolactone. The infectivity of residual virus was examined by inoculating each sample into Vero cells for three blind passages. The result showed that the virus could be completely inactivated with -propiolactone, at dilution of 1 2000 for 24 h, or 1 4000 for 28 h. Purified SARS virus was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 3 ) under reducing conditions and was transferred onto a Millipore Immobilon-P PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked in TTBS containing 5% nonfat milk powder at 37 for 30 min before incubation with the diluted serum of anti-SARS positive patient (from Beijing region, TTBS, 1 1000, 4 overnight). Bound antibodies were detected using appropriate alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (TTBS, 1 1000), followed by nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) and 5-bromo-4chloro-3 -indolyphosphate p-toluidine salt (BCIP) for development.",

It provided a practical basis for developing an effective vaccine. The immunization protocol, production procedure and adjuvant of the vaccine are discussed as follows. ( ) Immunization protocol. Since this is the first paper reporting the research of inactivated SARS-COV vaccine, and SARS is a new viral disease, there is no immunization schedule for reference. According to our experience in developing influenza vaccine, we set up a schedule of inoculation with two doses at an interval of three weeks [11, 12] . The mice were bled three weeks after the first dose and one week after the second dose for de-tecting serum antibody. The result showed that either one dose or two doses of the vaccine induced good immune response. At present, a two-dose schedule is adopted in the immunization with inactivated influenza vaccine and shows good effect. However, the protective effect at least partially protective effect of one dose of influenza vaccine, has been reported recently. On the basis of experience in developing vaccines against other respiratory diseases, we consider that the immune effect of two doses of vaccine is satisfactory. During the epidemic period or in an emergency condition, whether a single dose of inactivated SARS-COV vaccine can provide protective or partially protective effect is to be further studied in clinical trial. However, the result of clinical trial shall be determined after two epidemic periods.",

We selected -propiolactone to inactivate virus because it was a kind of alkylating agent which could react with nucleic acid. -propiolactone could break the structure of nucleic acid through its reaction with purine bases (mainly guanine). The alkylating agent could either form gaps inside DNA or cause the cross linking of double stranded DNA, so it has been widely used for the inactivation of DNA and RNA viruses [13 16] . We could not detect the residual live virus in the vaccine after inactivation, proving that -propiolactone was suitable for the preparation of inactivated SARS-COV vaccine. After inactivation, we selected Sepharose 4FF column chromatography to purify virus particles. The antibody was under detective level in the mice immunized with crude antigen (data not shown). We considered that it might be due to the influence of interference of hetero-proteins on the normal immune response of animals. The result of our study showed that the production and purification procedure established here met the requirements of animal test. The procedure suitable for large-scale production is to be further studied.",

Aluminum hydroxide is an insoluble colloid precipitate with the particle size of 0.1 1 m, so antigen is bound to the colloid by static electricity. After being adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide, antigen forms storage pool at inoculation site and releases slowly. It may cause local inflammatory reactions to attract active lymphocytes and enhance immune response. It can also activate the complement system. Our study showed that the antibody level induced by the vaccine with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant was higher than that without adjuvant.

Perhaps some scientists have objections to our purification method, even to the inactivated vaccine. They may be anxious about the safety of the inactivated vaccine. They wonder if RNA strand can be completely broken by -propiolactone. In case individual virus particle contains an incompletely broken RNA strand, a problem in safety may occur. Some scientists may suggest developing subunit vaccine. The subunit vaccine shall be technically feasible, and the production cost is not very expensive. However, unlike the antigen determinants of inactivated vaccine in a natural state, the development of recombinant immunogens that mimic the oligomeric presentation of proteins found in virus particles may be difficult. Meanwhile, whether a single gene or multiple genes shall be selected to prepare the subunit vaccine is to be verified by further study. Another problem faced to us is whether the current BJ01 strain has individual representativeness or not. If SARS-CoV is prevalent again this winter, whether it will be widely varied is still unclear. The field for production is also a problem to the large-scale manufacturing of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine, since the proliferation of a large quantity of virus can only be performed in P3 laboratory. If an attenuated strain is selected and used for the production of vaccine instead of the current SARS-CoV strain, the above-mentioned problems are hopeful to be solved. In fact, the work to solve the problems is already in progress. This paper describes the inactivation and purification of SARS virus, the preparation of inactivated vaccine and the immunogenicity of the vaccine. It is beneficial to the scientists engaging in the research of SARS vaccine.",
