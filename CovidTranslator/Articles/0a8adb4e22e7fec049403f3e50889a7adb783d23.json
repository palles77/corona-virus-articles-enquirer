Herein, a general overview of different tools currently available, including T cell and B cell epitopes prediction tools, is presented. And the principles of different prediction algorithms are reviewed briefly. Finally, several examples are present to illustrate the application of the prediction tools. An epitope, or antigenic determinant, is the part of a macromolecular complex which is recognized by the immune system and is classified according to its targeting receptor. T cell epitopes, as presented in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule, are antigenic peptide strings recognized by T cells receptors. MHC\u2160 molecules present endogenous antigens while MHC\u2161 molecules present exogenous antigens. The MHC\u2160 molecule binds to a peptide of approximate 9 amino acids in length within a closed groove. In contrast, because the antigen-binding",

SVM and ANN based algorithms work by using a positive set of experimentally verified epitope sequences and a second set of negative sequences to train the system to classify query sequences as belonging to one of these two classes. These is achieved by defining a set of N descriptive features for these sequences (such as nucleotide or dinucleotide sequence composition) then training the system against these positive and negative datasets. 4) Epitopes prediction.

There are several reasons for this. For instance, the majority of B cell epitopes are discontinuous so that it is hard to determine the relevant amino acids and the distribution of the antigen surface. Moreover, much of the experimental data which the prediction algorithms are based on are still controversial because of the poorly understood recognition properties of crossreactive antibodies [1, 4] . Nevertheless, in spite of these difficulties, there are several methods available for B cell epitope prediction for both linear and conformational epitopes. The prediction algorithms for linear the accuracy of primary sequence-based algorithms is low [11] , and modified algorithms based on machine learning were subsequently developed, such as ABCpred [18] and BepiPred [14] with significant improvements in accuracy. Prediction algorithms for conformational B cell epitopes based on 3D structure are also available owing to the ever-increasing 3D structure of antigen-antibody complex data. Some online prediction servers based on this algorithm are accessible, for example DiscoTope [9] and CEP (http:// bioinfo.ernet.in/cep.htm) [13] . These methods make use When tested experimentally, some of these epitopes were able to stimulate a strong immune response, and vaccination with hMPV CTL epitopes could protect the hMPV-challenged mice. These results demonstrated the efficacy of an hMPV CTL epitope vaccine in the control of hMPV infection in mice for the first time [10] . The MHC\u2160 T cell epitopes of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) glycoproteins4 (GP4), 5 (GP5) and nucleocapsid were also predicted by SYFPEITHY and IEDB analysis while the MHC\u2161epitopes were predicted by ProPred.",

This difference between MHC\u2160 and MHC\u2161 is very important for the development of distinct prediction algorithms. B cell epitopes, which are recognized by antibodies or B cells, are divided into a series of continuous linear epitopes and discontinuous conformational epitopes. The conformational epitopes that comprise the major B cell epitopes can be considered in terms of the three-dimensional (3D) surface features they contribute to the antigenic molecules, whereas the linear epitopes are defined by the amino acid sequence rather than by their 3D shape. Given their impact on global health, much effort has been expended into elucidating the mechanisms utilized by viruses in order to elude the host immune system and development of prophylatic and therapeutic vaccines. Traditional vaccines are based on inactivated or attenuated pathogens.

Generally, the accuracy which measures the ratio of correct predictions comprising true positive and true negative by (TP+TN)/(TP+FP+TN+FN), is the major criterion for assessing the quality of a predictive model. A predictive model with higher accuracy is often better than the lower one. Also, the sensitivity which measures the ratio of true positive by TP/(TP+FN), the specificity which measures the ratio of true negative by TN/(TN+FP) are important criterions. The accuracy is increased by increasing simultaneously both sensitivity and specificity, or by increasing either. Theoretically, an optimal predictioncan reach 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, which means the 100% accuracy; while in practice, it is impossible to achieve such a perfect prediction, there is usually a trade-off between the measures.Usually, the machine-learning based algorithms perform better than the motif-based algorithms in T",

More generally, this extends to attempting to find the N-1 dimensional hyperplane that distinguishes the two sets in the N dimensions of the feature space. The reliability of the trained model is investigated by cross validation, a process in which the training is subdivided into smaller sets and the system is retrained. Finally, the accuracy of the model is tested with the training dataset. HMM based prediction methods work by representing the difference between a experimentally verified epitope and a query sequence as a statistical process. For example, a single base difference between the two sequences would require a single state change in the form of a single mutation. The probability of the state changed is estimated from likelihood of the change in the experimental sequences.In this way, query sequences which are more similar to known experimental sequences require few state changes and have a higher probability of classification as possible epitopes.In brief, the steps of machine learning-based epitopes prediction algorithms are: 1) Data collection and processing; 2) Model building; 3) Parameter optimization;",
