The chronic inflammation in asthma is a pleiotropic picture that usually includes an increase in the number of activated T cells, which predominantly secrete T helper (T H ) 2-like cytokines such as interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-5 and IL-13. This pattern of cytokine secretion, together with the secretion of epithelial-derived chemokines such as eotaxin (CCL11) and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted; CCL5), promotes the recruitment and activation of eosinophils and mast cells, which contribute to chronic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness of the airway to a variety of nonspecific stimuli. These factors, together with chronic structural changes to the airway and increased production of mucus by goblet cells, increase the risk of intermittent episodes of acute obstruction of airflow through the small airways of the lung in response to irritants (such as tobacco, smoke and air pollution), allergens and acute viral infections.",

Collectively, however, the variability in the studies' results may be attributable to several factors, including the specific viral pathogen, the severity of the illness, the anatomical location of the illness and the age of the affected individual. The following sections 31 The relationship between viral infections, wheezing illnesses and asthma is a close one in all age groups. It has long been appreciated that certain viral infections in infancy, for example those caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cause inflammation and obstruction of the small airways (bronchioles), which lead to coughing and wheezing. It has also been proposed that infants who contract RSV bronchiolitis are at an increased risk of developing asthma later in life. By contrast, recent epidemiological studies indicate that not all viral infections increase the risk of asthma and, in fact, some may actually reduce the risk of developing allergic diseases and asthma.",

The pathogenesis of asthma will be reviewed, and current concepts Relationship of viral infections to wheezing illnesses and asthma Do viruses protect against asthma? Some viral infections might actually protect against the development of allergies and asthma. This controversial idea, termed the 'hygiene hypothesis', was first suggested by David Strachan, who noted that the risk of developing allergies and asthma is inversely related to the number of children in the family 23 -a result that has been replicated in several subsequent studies 24 . This finding has led to speculation that infectious diseases, which are more likely to be transmitted in large families, could modulate the development of the immune system in such a way as to reduce the chances of developing allergies. This hypothesis implies that the immune system is skewed towards a T H 2-like response pattern at birth 25 . According to the theory, each viral infection would provide a stimulus for the development and/or activation of T H 1-like immune responses. The result of this repetitive stimulation would be to change the polarization of the T H system away from a T H 2 overexpression and thus reduce the risk of developing allergies (FIG. 3) .",

Most of the risk factors for developing asthma after bronchiolitis in infancy relate to other signs or indicators of allergy, such as atopic dermatitis, food allergy or allergic rhinitis [12] [13] [14] . Furthermore, there is evidence that certain patterns of immune response to the infection, including eosinophilic inflammation in airway secretions [15] [16] [17] , reduced interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) ex vivo 18 , and increased ex vivo PBMC IL-10 secretion during convalescence 19 , are associated with an increased risk of recurrent wheezing, and possibly asthma. In animal models of infection with a related paramyxovirus, episodic lower airway obstruction after Sendai virus infection has been related to reduced production of IFN-\u03b3 20 , and it is likely that additional immunological risk factors for lower airway effects of respiratory virus infections in humans will be identified. Although lower airway infections with RSV seem to increase the risk of recurrent wheezing in childhood 21, 22 , this effect disappears by the age of 13 years 21 , indicating the increasing importance of other risk factors for asthma later on in childhood.",

The immune response to the virus, including cell recruitment and activation, and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators (for example, leukotrienes, kinins and prostenoids), can also contribute to the pathogenesis of respiratory infections. For viruses such as rhinoviruses, which infect relatively few cells in the airway, it may be the primary mechanism that causes airway symptoms and lower airway dysfunction 48, 49 . cold virus can produce severe wheezing 34 .",

            "text": "Understanding how respiratory viruses such as RSV and influenza virus can affect lower airway physiology is reasonably straightforward because these organisms infect and injure lower airway tissues. The rhinovirus has traditionally been considered to be an upper airway pathogen, as early studies indicated that it replicates better at 33-35 \u00b0C than at body temperature, and its injurious effects on airway tissue are limited. However, whether it induces acute asthma by infecting lower airway tissues is controversial. Direct measurements, however, have shown that temperatures in the proximal lower airways are conducive to rhinovirus replication, and only exceed 35 \u00b0C in the periphery of the lung 36 . Moreover, rhinovirus seems to replicate equally well in cultured epithelial cells derived from either upper or lower airway epithelium 37 , and has been detected in lower airway cells and secretions after experimental inoculation 38, 39 . Finally, inoculation of healthy volunteers with rhinovirus produces lower airway inflammatory changes, including increases in neutrophils 40 , lymphocytes 41, 42 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) 43 . In addition, rhinovirus infection has been found to cause small increases in lower airway eosinophils in some 40, 41 , but not all 42 , studies. Remaining areas of investigation include determining how much virus is present in the lower airway and establishing whether viral replication in the lower airway is a sufficient stimulus to provoke exacerbations of asthma. as measles, can protect against allergies and asthma 26 have not been confirmed 27 . However, the hygiene hypothesis is supported by studies that show an inverse relationship between attendance at day care centres, where exposure to viral infections is quite high, and subsequent rates of allergy and asthma development 28 . However, it is not only the type of infection that is important, but also the route of exposure, as food-borne or enteric infections may have greater effects on allergy than respiratory infections 29 . Finally, it may not be the infections per se that are important, but rather exposure to microbes or microbial products in the environment. This concept is supported by the finding that exposure to a farming environment in early childhood, and/or having exposure to higher levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is associated with reduced rates of allergy and asthma development [30] [31] [32] [33] , Collectively, these findings indicate that repeated exposure to common infectious diseases and prolonged exposure to microbial products may protect against the development of allergies and asthma. If this concept is confirmed, determining the relevant mechanisms involved could lead to an entirely new approach to the prevention of these common problems.",

Activation of PKR has been linked to nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation, and the generation of pro-inflammatory and antiviral cytokines. Moreover, dsRNA activation of PKR induces antiviral activity through the generation of nitric oxide, inhibition of cellular translation and activation of RNase L [55] [56] [57] [58] . In turn, many viruses have evolved mechanisms to inhibit these pathways to increase the probability of viral replication 55 . So, host-cell recognition of dsRNA seems to be an important pathway for the initiation of multiple pro-inflammatory and antiviral pathways within the cell. Whether innate antiviral responses to viral infection are impaired in asthma is clearly of interest; however, it has not yet been determined.",

The problem with this approach is that, once viral respiratory infections are recognized, much of the viral replication has already occurred and, consequently, there is likely to be a limited potential for antiviral agents to affect the course of the illness. Thus, neuramidase inhibitors, which have potent antiviral activity in vitro, have only modest effects on clinical influenza, and are only effective if used early in the course of the illness 75 . The neuramidase inhibitors are most effective when given prophylactically, and they have been shown to prevent ~80% of clinically apparent cases of the flu 76 .

It should be noted that oral corticosteroids are ineffective at reducing wheezing caused by RSV infection in infants, indicating that there are differences in the pathogenesis of these two clinical syndromes.

It is possible that this is a causal relationship, and that RSV bronchiolitis alters immune responses or lung development to promote allergy or asthma. Alternately, RSV infection could be an early stimulus for wheezing in children who have a predisposition for allergies and asthma.
