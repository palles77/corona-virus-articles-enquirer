However, in the murine X human cross, there is evidence that the loss of human chromosomes is not random and that some are preferentially retained ( Kozbor and Croce, 1985) . Teng et al. (1983) and Tucker et al. (1984) replaced the usual mouse myeloma line with a heteromyeloma, produced by the fusion of human or bovine lymphocytes respectively with a mouse myeloma line. This strategy reduced the loss of non-murine chromosomes and the associated disruption of gene expression in the resulting hybridomas. The current paper reports the use of an interspecific fusion partner, generated by sensitizing a murine \u00d7 bovine hybridoma line to selective media. This heteromyeloma was then used to produce a monoclonal cell line secreting a bovine antibody to oestrone/oestradiol.",

Tucker and her colleagues have developed a number of bovine monoclonal antibodies against blood group determinants (Tucker et al., 1984 Anderson et al., 1986) and bacterial antigens (Anderson et al., 1987) using heteromyelomas as well as NSO mouse myeloma cells as the immortal fusion partners. Davidson et al. (1982) reported the production of a bovine IgM of undefined specificity by fusing bovine leukemic lymphocytes with NS1 or X63 mouse myeloma cells. Raybould et al. (1985) have produced a bovine IgG2 reacting with bovine enteric coronavirus by fusing sensitized lymphocytes with SP2/0 cells. Our own laboratory has recently reported the isolation of a (mu-rineXbovine) xbovine hybridoma secreting a bovine IgG1 directed against testosterone (Groves et al., 1987b) .",

(1987b) . The fusion ratio of lymphocytes:heteromyeloma cells in this study was 8:1 with a total cell number of 4.5 X 107 for each fusion. This compares with the conditions used by Srikumaran et al. (1984) (1:1; 2X10S), Groves et al. (1987b) Secretion levels obtained were of a similar order to those reported in other interspecies fusions (e.g. Nowinski et al., 1983; Teng et al., 1983; Abrams et al., 1984; Groves et al., 1987b) . Comparison of production rates of different bovine \u00d7 murine hybridomas is difficult because of the lack of uniformity of expression of this parameter. The stability of the cell line B/ME.8.10.B6 was established after repeated cloning and the antibody secretion was not affected by repeated passaging of the cells or by freezing in liquid nitrogen and subsequent thawing.",

Both antisera are effective in increasing ovulation rate and lambing rate in Welsh mountain ewes. Since the most effective use of passive immunization has been shown to be the administration of a mixture of antisera to different steroids (Land et al., 1982) the specificity of the reported monoclonal antibody to oestrone/oestradiol should not impair its usefulness.",
