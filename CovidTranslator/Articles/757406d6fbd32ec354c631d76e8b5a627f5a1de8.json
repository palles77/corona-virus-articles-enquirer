An emerging field of microfluidics also known as the lab-on-a-chip (LOC) or micro total analysis system includes a wide range of diagnostic devices. This review briefly covers both conventional and microfluidics-based techniques for rapid viral detection. We first describe conventional detection methods such as cell culturing, immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These methods often have limited speed, sensitivity, or specificity and are performed with typically bulky equipment. Here, we discuss some of the LOC technologies that can overcome these demerits, highlighting the latest advances in LOC devices for viral disease diagnosis. We also discuss the fabrication of LOC systems to produce devices for performing either individual steps or virus detection in samples with the sample to answer method. The complete system consists of sample preparation, and ELISA and RT-PCR for viral-antibody and nucleic acid detection, respectively. Finally, we formulate our opinions on these areas for the future development of LOC systems for viral diagnostics.",

The viruses are subsequently detected by cytopathic effects, eliciting specific characteristics and alterations in host cells caused by viral invasion (Agol, 2012) (Fig. 1A) , followed by immunofluorescence staining to its identification. The alternative method based on cell cultures is haemadsorption where the erythrocytes adsorb to the plasma membrane of the virus-infected cell monolayer (Fig. 1B) . Cell culturing is a standard technique, but one of its drawbacks is that it takes approximately four weeks, which can be too long for tackling a potential viral disease outbreak (Papafragkou et al., 2013) . Therefore, the rapid shell vial culture method was developed (Jayakeerthi et al., 2006) . It is based on inoculation of the specimen on to the cell monolayer grown on a cover slip, followed by low-speed centrifugation and detection of the virus by immunofluorescence. However, this rapid culture test cannot target the required range of viruses and it does not possess sufficient sensitivity. Another simple and inexpensive technique is hemagglutination assay, which is based on the detection of the virus via agglutination of erythrocytes (Fig. 1C, upper) . This test later led to the hemagglutination inhibition assay (Hierholzer et al., 1969) (Fig. 1C, bottom) , a serological approach that detects specific antibodies against viral antigens (Hierholzer et al., 1969) . The complement fixation test also introduces a convenient and easy method based on the reaction of the complement with an antigen-antibody complex (Adone et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "However, the most conventional techniques mentioned above were later replaced with more sensitive and quantitative immunoassays capable of detecting the virus antigen or antibodies in clinical specimens (Weinberg and Walker, 2005) . The high specificity and binding affinity between antigen and antibody generated a number of immunomethods with different detection approaches such as radio-immunoassay (RIA), enzyme-linked techniques (EIA), and ELISA. The most commonly used one is RIA, utilizing a radioisotope-labeled antibody to detect antigens or vice versa. As an alternative to danger radioactive labels, the utilization of enzymatic labels such as peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase led to the development of EIA. Currently, EIA variants such as ELISA (Niikura et al., 2001) (Fig. 1E ) and chemiluminescent (Azar and Landry, 2018) or microparticle enzyme immunoassay (van den Berk et al., 2003) are widely used due to their high sensitivity. Especially ELISA, due to its dual specificity, became a gold standard for protein detection. Nevertheless, the co-circulation of closely related flaviviruses such as ZIKV and DENV in number of regions makes the conventional detection of a specific virus using immunoassays a complicated task (Wen and Shresta, 2019) . Also there is a window period between the viral infection and Table 1 Summary of emerging viruses with abbreviations: molecular (mol), serological (ser), reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), immunoglobulin type M (IgM), lateral flow assay (LFA), nonstructural protein (NS1), immunoglobulin type G (IgG), loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), digital PCR (dPCR) enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) and IgM antibody capture ELISA (MAC-ELISA), double antibody sandwich ELISA (DAS-ELISA), enzyme linked immunospotting (ELISPOT), data not available (N.A.), number of copies (c). (Hewa et al., 2009; Jung et al., 2015a) antibody production resulting in false negative results using immunoassays, which can be up as long as 35-45 days for first generation HIV testing (Cornett and Kirn, 2013) . The increase sensitivity acquired in fourth generation of immunoassays led to shortening this window to 10-15 days (Branson and Stekler, 2011) . NA-based detection methods have revolutionized virus-related diagnostics (Roy et al., 2017) having the false negative window period HIV between 10 and 15 days (Branson and Stekler, 2011) . Several techniques can directly detect specific viral DNA or RNA via in-situ hybridization (Pfankuche et al., 2018) (Fig. 1F ), dot-blot (Zhang et al., 2018a) , or Southern blotting (Cai et al., 2013) , but their sensitivity is insufficient. More sensitive techniques are based on NA amplification and its subsequent detection. Apart from endpoint PCR, the widely used variants are quantitative PCR (qPCR) for DNA (Edin et al., 2015) and RT-PCR for RNA (Zhang et al., 2018b) , and both are becoming benchmarks in viral load assessment. Currently, dPCR is gaining popularity due to its ability to detect either DNA or RNA, with absolute gene quantification being more immune to background noise than conventional qPCR (Martinez-Hernandez et al., 2019) . A number of alternative NA techniques have been developed including NA sequence-based amplification (Lanciotti and Kerst, 2001) , strand displacement amplification (Shi et al., 2014) , or branched DNA probes (Zhang et al., 2018a) .",

But these methods are limited by the fabrication accuracy and size. The MEMS technique is widely used for silicon and glass substrate chip fabrication. Lithography is a general MEMS technology used in microfabrication to transform microstructures from masks to a substrate with a limited width of a few nanometers. This technology is utilized to fabricate silicon and glass based microfluidic chips or masters for microstructures, followed by substrate etching and wafer bonding. One of the earliest widespread MEMS technology for LOC and microfluidic devices is anodic bonding, wherein micromachined silicon is capped by glass to produce the microfluidic device ( Fig. 2A ) (Qi et al., 2018) . This fabrication method is relatively simple, cost-effective, and has a high yield of glass/silicon chips with excellent transparency of glass and practically no self-induced fluorescence (Iliescu et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "Soft lithography represents a conceptually different approach to rapid prototyping of various types of both microscale and nanoscale structures, and devices on variable materials and complex microstructures. A large number of patterning techniques are developed for the microfabrication of microfluidic devices, such as replica molding, microcontact printing, micromolding in capillaries, hot embossing, and microtransfer molding. For example, the micromolding technique was developed with two approaches involving either liquid or solid materials. A monomer of an elastomer such as PDMS (Karthik et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2012) is poured over a three-dimensional (3D) mask used as the (Hierholzer et al., 1969) .

The mold is typically made of materials such as silicon, metal, or plastic, often produced by lithography (Fig. 2B) . Then, the PDMS is separated from the mold, its surface is activated by O 2 plasma, and then it is bonded to the glass substrate (Haubert et al., 2006) . Another popular technique for fabricating microfluidic chips, called hot embossing (Fig. 2C) , involves the use of hard materials. It can be wafer-based using a silicon wafer with a 3D surface pattern or a roll-to-roll using nickel or steel patterns to press against the substrate such as COC, PC, or PMMA. This roll-to-roll hot embossing technique is suitable for the large-scale production of microfluidic chips with a throughput of over 250,000 chips per day per line (Peng et al., 2016) .",

The methods for paper-based device fabrication are fully developed forming channels originally performed by printing (Carrilho et al., 2009 ). The paper surface properties can be modified by formation of hydrophilic patterns on a hydrophobic membrane with plasma (Li et al., 2008) or laser treated surface (Chitnis et al., 2011) . Another technique was employed to form superhydrophobic properties using polyhydroxybutyrate (Obeso et al., 2013) . The paper-based microfluidics can be also direct cut with a laser or cutting plotter, printing with wax or biomolecules forming microchannel and test zones, mask-based fabrication, such as photolithography and wet etching, and screen-printing. Those methods are utilized to fabricate single layer paper devices, also allowed to form 3D devices by stacking papers such as origami (Liu and Crooks, 2011) , even in easily reconfigurable configuration (Kong et al., 2017) . As of now, paper-based devices do not have sufficient sensitivity, so further research and development in this area as well as in the implementation of suitable functionalization and immobilization of biomolecules (Yamada et al., 2017) is required. Paper-based detection, such as lateral flow strips (LFS), serve as qualitative diagnosis caused by the low precision of colorimetric device both for nucleic acids and proteins. The results are influenced by different lighting conditions and the variation in the color perception of users. In order to achieve quantitative analysis in paper-based diagnostics, commercial strip readers and color sensors have been used to record the color intensity, followed by the use of image-processing and analyzing software.",

Thus, steps of separation and concentration are needed to exclude unwanted cell types and matrix fluids and to enrich the target cells when handling complex matrices such as blood, urine, and saliva . Microfluidics offers different techniques for viral particle separation. In the case of filtration with a charge-based membrane, the membrane is applied within the microfluidic cassette for HIV particle isolation, concentration, and detection in suspended raw saliva. HIV particles can be isolated from whole blood using an LOC filter-based chip with pore sizes between 1 \u03bcm and 2 \u03bcm from HIV-spiked samples at recovery efficiencies of (89.9 \ufffd 5.0)%, (80.5 \ufffd 4.3)%, and (78.2 \ufffd 3.8)% for viral loads of 1000, 10,000, and 100,000 copies\u22c5mL 1 , respectively (Reinholt and Baeumner, 2014; Wang et al., 2012) .",

The VACNT were synthetized at channel walls using chemical vapor deposition forming a VACNT forest with 97% porosity able to capture lentivirus measuring \ufffd128 nm in diameter, with an efficiency of 97% (Yeh J.T. 2018) . Another microfluidic device was integrated with a porous silicon nanowires (pSiNWs) forest for efficient virus isolation and their subsequent release. The device represents a continuous flow design with cross-flow filtration configuration to achieve large volume and high processing speed. Approximately 50% of influenza viruses were physically isolated in \ufffd30 min in the pSiNWs forest. The viruses could be released through degradation on the pSiNWs forest in \ufffd24 h (Wu et al., 2017) . A sample preparation platform was developed that used a spiral inertial microfluidic device with continuous circulation to separate host cells from viral particles and free NAs. Removal with this device led to the reduction in human (host) background reads in metagenomic sequencing for viral detection and sequencing . Another approach for separating the sample is dielectrophoresis (DEP). It is implemented in microfluidic chips and used to capture DENV. The mechanism of detection involves the use of the DEP force to capture the modified beads in the microfluidic chip and the DENV modified with the fluorescence label, as the detection target can be captured on the modified beads by immunoreaction (Iswardy et al., 2017) . Aptamers and antibodies are used for heterogeneous cell separation ). An aptamer-based sandwich system was developed to capture and detect rare cells on a chip. An acoustic microfluidic device was developed for DENV cell separation from mammalian cells (Fong et al., 2014) , with an efficiency of \ufffd70% using sample flow rate of \ufffd100 mL min 1 .",

A PCR protocol typically consists of \ufffd40 thermal cycles effectively doubling the number of DNA molecules in each cycle. This process can theoretically achieve multiplication of the original number of DNA copies (Valasek and Repa, 2005 ) by a factor of 2 40 . The original end point detection PCR was modified by adding either intercalating dye or a probe forming real-time PCR (Higuchi et al., 1993) . Parameter called critical threshold is used for relative DNA quantification by comparison with standard PCR curve, thus the method is also called quantitative PCR (qPCR). A new method of digital PCR (dPCR) was developed (Vogelstein and Kinzler, 1999) with sample compartmentalized (digitized) into thousands sub samples to get either one or none DNA copy per sample. Once the PCR was completed the automated system determined number of sub samples with amplified DNA resulting in absolute DNA quantification in the sample. The dPCR method is more complex than the qPCR, but the copy number resolution is far superior. The system also allows performing the PCR multiplexing with large difference in copy number of concurrently amplified DNAs (Ottesen et al., 2006) .",

An integrated handheld real-time PCR device was utilized to detect the Ebola virus RNA using single-step RT-PCR (Ahrberg et al., 2016b) . The device (Fig. 4A) concurrently performed four PCRs, each with a sample volume of \ufffd0.1 \u03bcL covered with \ufffd2 \u03bcL of mineral oil. The entire process consisted of an RT step to convert the RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA), PCR, and melting curve analysis, all conducted in <37 min. Although it is a relatively fast device, the sample preparation was not integrated with the real-time PCR system. Nevertheless, this system was demonstrated to be capable of performing qPCR multiplexing using a single fluorescent channel, either by combining an FAM probe and an intercalating dye (Ahrberg and Neu\ufffd zil, 2015) or using only an intercalating dye .",

The researchers employed magnetic beads for NA extraction in an eight-channel microfluidic array chip integrated with a LAMP system for POC screening of respiratory viruses. Another isothermal amplification device was used to detect ZIKV with a single-step RT-LAMP assay (Fig. 4E) (Song et al., 2016) . The elevated temperature required to perform RT-LAMP was achieved by heating the system using an exothermic chemical reaction, eliminating the requirement for external electrical power supply. Amplification products were detected by the naked eye using a leucocrystal violet dye, eliminating additional instrumentation moving towards a lab-on-a-chip system. RPA operates at a relatively low temperature range from \ufffd37 \ufffd C to \ufffd42 \ufffd C. The target DNA sequence can be amplified using recombinase, single-strand binding proteins, and strand displacement polymerase. An RPA-based microfluidic system (Fig. 4F ) was used to spatially separate the amplification reaction of DNA from two viruses: the human adenovirus and phage (Kunze et al., 2015) of Phi X 174.",

A cellulose paper with printed graphene-modified silver electrodes (Fig. 5G) was used for the electrical conductivity measurement integrated with LAMP for HIV detection (Safavieh et al., 2017) . The reduction in the sample electrical conductivity is correlated to the concentration of the target nucleic acid resulting in both qualitative and quantitative detection.",

An external electronic control system for temperature cycling required to conduct PCR. The sample is loaded by a vacuum inside the chambers, the RT-PCR is conducted and then the product is loaded onto an area with hybridization probes. The results are read by a florescence camera system and the diagnosed RNA/DNA is determined from the captured fluorescent pattern. The company CEO's philosophy was to conduct only RT-PCR as it can amplify both RNA as well as the DNA and there is only one protocol, making the system operation simpler. Based on this philosophy, various RNA/DNA kits were developed (Tan et al., 2014) . Each device has its own bar code linked to the system database for device history tracking.",

This user-friendly system can be modified to perform ELISA with fluorescent optical detection, bringing the cost per test down to a reasonable level. These diagnostic kits will be available in a ready-to-use format and not do it yourself. Palm-sized RT-PCR systems for RNA detention have already been developed (Ahrberg et al. 2016a (Ahrberg et al. , 2016b as well as complex stationary sample-answer systems based on RT-PCR (Nash et al., 2017) . We envision the miniaturization of sample preparation followed by RT-PCR for viral RNA diagnosis. However, the sample volume needed to be processed for diseases with a low viral load, such as HIV, prevents the sample from being directly processed by LOC. This problem can be solved by adding a sample pre-concentration step where the viruses or the RNA from a volume of tens or hundreds of \u03bcL will be concentrated to a few \u03bcL and then processed by the LOC system. This would be ideally performed in a touch-free manner to avoid possible contamination of the person handling the blood, which would be irrelevant if the infected person were handling his/her own sample. Nevertheless, minimal human intervention is essential, and thus the development should lead to a sample-to-answer system. Smartphone platforms will be heavily used as they have high resolution cameras and test results can be directly sent to the medical personnel or heath centers monitoring the infectious disease outbreak. Connecting all these diagnostic systems with centers and large dataprocessing facilities will form a true IoT (Zhu et al., 2020) for healthcare authorities. User-friendly software for data acquisition and analysis can be developed using Android or different operating systems to increase public safety. The LOC technology for POC assays is moving towards speed and efficiency in the diagnosis of viral diseases. Portability, cost, automation, speed, efficiency, and connectivity are critical technical parameters for the future generation of LOCs in viral disease diagnosis.",
