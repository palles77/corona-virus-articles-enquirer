In this section formulas are offered as starting points; however, it is intended that they should be modified to match the needs of the individual patient wherever possible (see Chapter 19) .",

In the authors' experience herbal medicines can frequently be used alongside the conventional approach but can also be used instead in many instances, particularly for complicated or chronic conditions. Care should always be taken to consider possible drug-herb interactions and herb-herb interactions, dosing, and the vitality of the patient. Inexperienced veterinary herbalists are advised to cross reference with the monographs and chapters pertaining to prescribing and pharmacology. In many cases below, studies are described that involve experimental animal models and herb extracts (as opposed to whole herbs). It is important to maintain proper perspective on if and how these studies relate to clinical patients, whether they are safe in the species of interest, and how dosing of an herb might differ from doses described in the studies.",

Immune function represents an ecologic balance within the body that is attained with contributions from endocrine and neurologic activities. It has even been recognized that the \"invaders\" fought by the immune system are not all bad-we may even need our viruses to help us fend off the development of tumors and our bacteria to maintain normal immune function.",

Most clinical studies in humans have involved upper respiratory infection and, in fact, Echinacea may shorten the duration of the common cold (Percival, 2000) , depending on the form administered. Echinacea is often recommended for chronic recurrent viral upper respiratory infection in cats, and some practitioners use Echinacea to treat patients with retroviral infection. Although some practitioners caution against the long-term use of Echinacea because toxicity or autoimmune conditions may result, this concern has not been well documented. However, immunostimulants are probably best used as pulsed treatments if they are administered on a long-term basis, because full response to treatment is probably reached in a few weeks and does not continue to increase. In a 4-day observational study conducted at the Ohio Eclectic College in 1935, students were administered Echinacea before meals and at bedtime. Leukocyte counts increased 24 to 48 hours after initiation of treatment. Short-term (2-to 4-week), on-off administration is most sensible. The Echinacea monograph (see Chapter 24) describes studies in swine and horses that suggest immune modulating effects in these species.",

            "text": "\u2022 Identify causative factors (e.g., retroviral or other chronic disorders). Patients with poor immunity should be prescribed herbs from three main groups: 1. Immune-enhancing herbs. Selection can be based on traditional notions of organ or system affinity, or may be combined according to their other effects on the body. Herbs to consider include Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea, E. angustifolia, E. pallida), Astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus), Ligusticum walchii, Pau d'arco (Tabebuia avellanedae), Usnea (Usnea barbata), Picrorrhiza kurroa, Ginseng (Panax spp), and medicinal fungi such as Reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum), Maitake mushroom (Grifola frondosa), Shitake mushroom (Lentinus edodes), Turkey tail (Trametes versicolor), and Cordyceps (Cordyceps sinensis). 2. Tonic and adaptogenic herbs. These include Panax, Eleutherococcus, and Ashwagandha. As a general guide, stimulating herbs should be avoided during the acute phase of an infection. This is perhaps derived from traditional Chinese medicine, wherein stimulating and tonic herbs are contraindicated in Deficient Yin patterns with Heat signs-typically, fever and inflammation or infection. One study on Eleutherococcus showed that administration before induced listeriosis infection in rabbits and mice increased resistance to infection. However, when administration occurred simultaneously with an induced infection, the severity of disease was exacerbated (Farnsworth, 1966) . Despite this, Eleutherococcus is frequently found in low doses in formulations for acute infection such as cold and flu. 3. Bitter herbs. Gentiana or any of the bitters described under the gastrointestinal system should be considered; these are generally cooling herbs. If the patient is cool or cold, the cooling effect should be countered with warming herbs. One of the proposed theories for the benefit of bitters is the general improvement that occurs in digestive function, hence enhanced gutassociated lymphoid tissue function. Better immunity at the gut level (T helper 3 cell mediated) helps to moderate and regulate T helper 1 and T helper 2 cells, thereby improving immune balance systemically. Echinacea and Astragalus are two of the most popular \"immune\" herbs in human herbal medicine. Echinacea improves phagocytosis and generally enhances immune surveillance. It must be used in high doses during acute infections, such as infected wounds or viral infections. In humans, doses of 20 to 30 mL per day can be taken; it takes about 3 days for phagocytic activity to peak. Many studies that detract from the benefits of Echinacea are flawed by incorrect dosing and improper extract type. Echinacea can be used for chronic bacterial and viral infections, postviral syndromes, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome resulting from feline leukemia virus (FAIDS), in the appropriate formulas, autoimmune disease and long-term allergies and intolerances. It can be used during chemotherapy or pneumonia, and for chronic purulent or pyodermic skin infection-at relatively high doses in all cases (in humans, 15 mL per day for serious chronic states of immune deficiency). Doses as high as 40 mL on the first day followed by 16 mL daily were used in one positive clinical trial (Goel, 2004) . Astragalus, on the other hand, is more appropriately used as a preventive measure during disease outbreaks or for chronic immune incompetence and autoimmune disease (especially nephritis). The dose in humans is between 20 and 40 mL per week. High dosing in the case of Echinacea is an important consideration because it does influence efficacy.",

Cellular mutation may occur as a result of free radical damage (with activation of oncogenes or suppression of tumor suppressor genes) and genetic susceptibility and toxicity (e.g., hepatopathogenic toxins). In traditional herbal medicine, cancer is nearly always viewed as a sign of systemic toxicity. However, immune dysregulation has to be considered, and can occur with stress, toxin, heavy metal and pesticide exposure, dysbiosis, hormonal imbalance, nutrient imbalance, infection, inflammation, and radiation. Chemotherapy is also a major cause of immune dysregulation; for example, vincristine is weakly myelosuppressive, and cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids are strongly myelopsuppressive.",

Lung metastasis incidence was 55.6% in the control group and 22.2% in the flaxseed group; the incidence of lymph node metastasis was 88.9% in controls and 33.3% in the flaxseed group. Metastatic lung tumor number was reduced by 82% in the flaxseed group. It was concluded that flaxseed inhibits human breast cancer growth and metastasis in a mouse model, and that this effect is due in part to the downregulation of insulin-like growth factor I and epidermal growth factor receptor expression .",

Acemannan in the presence of interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) induces apoptosis in cancer cells (Ramamoorthy, 1998) . It is conditionally licensed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the treatment of dogs and cats with fibrosarcoma (King, 1995) . A total of eight dogs and five cats with histopathologically confirmed fibrosarcoma were treated with acemannan in combination with surgery and radiation therapy. Following four to seven weekly treatments, tumor shrinkage occurred in 4 of 12 animals. Complete surgical excision was performed on all animals between 4 and 7 weeks after initiation of acemannan therapy. Radiation therapy was instituted immediately after surgery. Acemannan treatments were continued monthly for 1 year. In all, 7 of 13 animals were alive and tumor free (range, 440+ to 603+ days), with a median survival time of 372 days. Acemannan may be an effective adjunct to surgery and radiation therapy in the treatment of canine and feline fibrosarcomas (King, 1995) . A total of 43 dogs and cats with spontaneous tumor were treated with acemannan by intraperitoneal and intralesional routes of administration. Tumors from 26 of these animals showed marked necrosis or lymphocytic infiltration. Moderate to marked tumor necrosis or liquefaction was noted in 13 animals. In all, 21 demonstrated lymphoid infiltration, and 7 demonstrated encapsulation. A total of 12 animals showed obvious clinical improvement, as assessed by tumor shrinkage, tumor necrosis, or prolonged survival; these included five of the seven animals with fibrosarcoma. It is believed that acemannan exerts its antitumor activity through macrophage activation and the release of tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, and interferon (Harris, 1991) .",

Survival was significantly prolonged and enlargement of thymic lymphoma was significantly suppressed compared with controls. Proliferation of leukemia (MuLV) viruses in the thymus was markedly inhibited as compared with untreated controls after the first oral administration of the E. purpurea preparation. Endogenous IFN-\u03b3 was also effectively augmented with Echinacea; however, the production of other cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IL-12 was minimal. Thus, suppressive effects on MuLV may depend on enhancement of nonspecific immune or cellular immune systems (or both) by Echinacea (Hayashi, 2001) . Daily dietary administration of E. purpurea root extract to normal mice for as little as 1 week also resulted in significant elevations in NK cells (immune cells that are cytolytic to virus-containing cells and many tumor cells). Such boosting of this fundamental immune cell population suggests a prophylactic role for this herb in normal animals (Currier, 2001) . E. purpurea-treated mice exhibited a 2.5-fold increase in the absolute numbers of NK cells in their spleens. By 3 months after leukemia induction, E. purpurea-treated mice still had 2 to 3 times the normal numbers of NK cells in their spleens compared with controls. No leukemic, untreated (control) mice remained alive at 3 months; however, at 3 months after tumor onset, all major hematopoietic and immune cell lineages in the bone marrow birth site were recorded at normal numbers in E. purpurea-consuming, leukemic mice. The survival advantage provided by administration of E. purpurea to these leukemic mice versus untreated mice was highly significant (Currier, 2001) .",

Whether Hoxsey's particular formula has therapeutic merit is still unsubstantiated by clinical data, despite provocative findings of antitumor properties in many of the individual herbs that he used. However, anecdotal evidence from veterinarians who have used various versions of the formula indicates that it improves quality of life and may inhibit growth of tumors in animals. It is difficult to evaluate the benefits of the traditional approach of detoxification through laxative effects, liver support, improved nutrition, and so forth, all of which may strengthen the immune system and favorably affect the cancer status of a human patient (Spain, 1988) ; Hoxsey proposed that this was how the formula worked.",

If this is done, anticancer activity is usually inherent in the prescription. As well, specific herbs can be used for known activity against particular types of cancers. Many herbs exhibit overlapping actions that fulfill more than one action category (Figure 20-1).

            "text": "Many oncology drugs induce cellular toxicity and death through free radical generation; some concern exists that antioxidants may negate these cytotoxic properties. In a review of all English articles listed in Index Medicus between the years 1990 and 2000 that were related to antioxidants and interactions with anticancer drugs or radiation, the authors concluded, \"There is a rational basis for the continued use of antioxidant agents as a therapeutic adjunct in cancer therapy, with such use also offering potential to abrogate the carcinogenic process and mutation-driven drug resistance, but convincing data and widespread acceptance of such a role [are] dependent on additional, appropriately relevant trials\" (Block, 2001) . Chemotherapeutic drugs that are best known for creating cellular damage by initiating free radical and reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage include the alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and melphalan; the tumor antibiotics, such as doxorubicin, bleomycin, and epirubicin; and the platinum compounds, such as cisplatin (Conklin, 2000; Labriola, 1999; Lamson, 1999; Lamson, 2000) . Radiation therapy uses ionizing radiation to produce cell kill through free radical generation (Lamson, 1999; Lamson, 2000) . Unfortunately, a number of physiologic adverse effects of these therapies (e.g., doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, cisplatin-induced nephrotoxity, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis) are related to oxidative damage (Conklin, 2000) . Evidence is accumulating that antioxidants are helpful in attenuating these side effects (Ferreira, 2004) , (Weijl, 2004) . Careful selection of herbs that help reduce these adverse effects and protect these organs and systems (see relevant system herbs) can be used. Because antioxidant activity is inherent in many herbs, two options with chemotherapy and radiation therapy are available, if the theoretical concern exists. Herbal treatment should be stopped just before conventional treatment is begun (24-48 hours) and recommenced in approximately 5-7 days depending on the half life of the chemotherapeutic drug (or longer for radiation therapy); or herbal treatment should be continued concurrently. In the authors' experience, concurrent treatment helps to reduce the adverse effects of treatment and to maintain \"wellness.\"",

The mechanism is attributed to a slight inhibition of sodium/potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na + /K + -ATPase), which might be responsible for the positive inotropic action. Evidence also reveals inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACEs) and of interactions with the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)mediated \u03b2-adrenergic system, which may explain the vascular effects of the extract. Most trials indicate greatest effect after 6 to 8 weeks of use, and clinical trials in humans suggest that higher doses are more effective in severe cases. In patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II heart failure (see Table 20 -1). 160 to 900 mg divided daily of a particular leaf and flower extract (WS 1442) was effective, but a dose of 1800 mg produced better results in people with Class III failure.",

Despite several adverse event reports associated with the use of Echinacea in patients with autoimmune disease, the risk has not been adequately studied. The British Herbal Pharmacopoeia (1983) and the British Herbal Compendium offer no contraindications for Echinacea. In fact, it is proposed ) that molecular mimicry by infectious organisms may be causative in autoimmune disease, and that Echinacea may be benefical in decreasing the chronic presence of microorganisms. Echinacea increases phagocytic activity and increases immune surveillance. This may assist the body in eliminating organisms or neutralizing their imbalancing effects on the immune system, thereby downregulating an inappropriate immune response.",

It has been suggested that glycyrrhizin and GA may exert their mineralocorticoid effects via inhibition of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11\u03b2-OHSD) (Stewart, 1987) . 11\u03b2-OHSD is a microsomal enzyme complex found predominantly in the liver and kidneys that catalyzes the conversion of cortisol (potent mineralocorticoid activity) to inactive cortisone. Deficiency of 11\u03b2-OHSD results in increased concentrations of urinary free cortisol and cortisol metabolites. GA has been shown to inhibit renal 11\u03b2-OHSD in rats (Stewart, 1987) . It has also been proposed that glycyrrhizin and GA may prevent cortisol from binding to transcortin (Forslund, 1989) . One recent case study reports the use of licorice in an Addisonian dog with persistent hyperkalemia. Preliminary results show the dog to be normokalemic after licorice administration (Jarrett, 2005) .",

For example, cucurbitine contained in crushed pumpkin seeds is only 55% efficacious against Taenia saginata (Pawlowski, 1970) , and arecoline hydrobromide, derived from Areca catechu (the betel nut palm), is very effective against all kinds of tapeworms; however, emesis and diarrhea are common adverse events. A common procedure was to follow administration of these plant compounds with a purgative, causing diarrhea to expel the affected worms. Because of the difficulty involved in killing intestinal worms without harming the patient, skill was always required in administering these anthelmintics (Mills, 1989) .",

For example, Spondias mombin has been studied in vivo for evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of water and alcohol extracts administered to sheep naturally infected with gastrointestinal nematodes. The mean percentage of fecal egg reduction on day 12 in sheep drenched with 500 mg/kg S. mombin extract was up to 100% against Haemonchus species, Trichostrongylus species, Oesophagostomum species, Strongyloides species, and Trichuris species, varying with concentration (Ademola, 2005) . In Pakistan, plants identified through ethnoveterinary research were screened for their in vitro anthelmintic activity. In vitro results showed that ginger killed all test worms (Haemonchus contortus) within 2 hours postexposure. Most worms exposed to control (normal saline) remained alive until 4 hours postexposure; then, 50% died within 6 hours postexposure. It was concluded that all studied plants had some anthelmintic activity (Zafar, 2001 ). An experiment was carried out to investigate the anthelmintic activity of papaya latex (Carica papaya) against natural infection of Ascaris suum in pigs. Pigs given 4 or 8 g of papaya latex per kilogram had worm count reductions of 80.1% and 100%, respectively. Some of the pigs receiving the highest dose of latex showed mild diarrhea on the day following treatment. Otherwise, no clinical or pathologic changes were observed in treated animals (Satrija, 1994) . Other herbs that have been traditionally used for their anthelmintic activity in humans and animals are discussed in the following paragraphs.",

The aim of antiemetic administration is to suppress the vomiting reflex, thus conserving the animal's strength, preventing loss of nutrients, and preserving the chloride content of the stomach, blood, and tissues. Gastric sedation should not be used to override essential vomition. Once this material has been removed, the reflex can be suppressed (Daykin, 1960) .

In a review of evidence from randomized controlled studies, one study was found for each of the following conditions: seasickness, morning sickness, and chemotherapyinduced nausea; these studies collectively favored ginger over placebo (Ernst, 2000a) . A later review of antiemetic therapies by the Cochrane Collaboration found 7 trials of ginger for vomiting in early pregnancy (Jewell, 2006) . Studies have documented the antiemetic effects of ginger extract in vivo in dogs (Chang, 1986; Sharma, 1997) and frogs (Kawai, 1994) . In dogs, acetone and ethanolic extracts of ginger, administered intragastrically at doses of 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, protected against cisplatininduced emesis (3 mg/kg administered intravenously 30 minutes before ginger extract), compared with control. However, ginger extracts were less effective in preventing emesis than was the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist granisetron, and they were ineffective against apomorphine-induced emesis (Sharma, 1997) . The emetic action of the peripherally acting agent copper sulfate was inhibited in dogs given an intragastric dose of ginger extract, but emesis in pigeons treated with centrally acting emetics such as apomorphine and digitalis could not be inhibited by a ginger extract (Zhou, 1960) . These results suggest that ginger's antiemetic activity is peripheral and does not involve the central nervous system. The antiemetic action of ginger has been attributed to the combined action of zingerones and shogaols (Ghazanfar, 1994) .",

These, in turn, send signals via the gustatory nerve (Mills, 1997) to promote the release of gastrointestinal hormones; they also have effects on other physiologic functions. Work published in 1915 by Moorhead revealed that a tincture of the herb Gentian (Gentiana lutea) given by mouth or directly into the stomach of cachectic dogs caused a marked increase in appetite. Only when gentian was given by mouth (i.e., tasted) did it cause a marked increase in gastric secretion of acid and pepsin content, and this effect occurred only after normal feeding. These effects provide rational explanations for the traditional use of bitters for liver and digestive complaints, poor appetite, debility, and a wide range of other conditions. It has been postulated that bitters applied to the mouth before a meal have a priming effect on upper digestive function, which is most marked in states in which digestion is below optimum. The increase in digestive function is probably mediated by a nerve reflex caused by the bitter taste buds and involves an increase in vagal stimulation (ACP, 1999) . Vagal stimulation causes an increase in gastric acid secretion, a transient rise in gastrin, an increase in pepsin secretion, a slight increase in gallbladder motility, and priming of the pancreas.",

Other actions that result are the relaxation of the gastrointestinal tract musculature, but particularly the cardiac sphincter, for a period of up to 30 minutes, which probably plays a large part in releasing gases from the stomach. The antispasmodic action of some of these, especially ginger, is due to the same factors, which give the carminative effect.

Seventy one percent of those receiving peppermint oil experienced improvement in abdominal pain, as opposed to 43% of those administered placebo (p < 0.002) (Kline, 2001) . Grigoleit et al (2005) monitored the gastrointestinal effects of peppermint oil in 269 people. Peppermint administration resulted in a substantial spasmolytic effect (Grigoleit, 2005) .

The active principle silymarin protects when given 60 minutes before intoxication with phalloidine, or 10 minutes after intoxication. However, as the time span between administration of the toxic substance and the start of treatment increases, so the efficacy of silymarin decreases; after 30 minutes, its curative effect is negligible (Desplaces, 1975) . Silymarin was tested in dogs that were subjected to carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ) intoxication, which leads to damage of the liver. The protective 332 PART IV \u2022 Veterinary Clinical Uses of Medicinal Plants effects of silymarin were manifested by the significantly lower aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities and by the insignificantly reduced extent of lesions in the liver parenchyma, compared with the control CCl 4 -intoxicated group (Paulova, 1990) . In another study, beagles were divided into 5 groups, and given 85 mg/kg Amanita phalloides lyophilizate orally. The 5 groups, after receiving Amanita extract, were then administered either no treatment (as a control group), prednisolone 30 mg/kg iv at 5 and 24 hours, cytochrome C 50 mg/kg iv at 5 and 24 hours, penicillin G 1000 mg/kg iv at 5 hours, or silymarin 50 mg/kg iv at 5 hours and 30 mg/kg iv at 24 hours. Blood was sampled at 5, 24, 48, 96 and 192 hours and changes in liver enzymes were monitored. At 24 hours post Amanita administration, GPT and GOT levels of the control group averaged over 4000 U/l while those of the silymarin group remained under 60 U/l, slightly lower than the penicillin group and significantly lower than those dogs administered prednisone or cytochrome C. At 48 hours, the control groups' values had returned to near normal with the exception of GPT, which averaged 2250 U/l. The prednisone group transaminase values continued to climb rather than resolve, and the other groups, including the silymarin group, remained in normal ranges (Floersheim, 1978) . Studies were conducted on the effects of silybin on the biological activities of Kupffer cells in regenerating livers of rats subjected to partial hepatectomy; results showed that silybin increased the mitotic activity of Kupffer cells (Magliulo, 1979) .",

The emodins (anthraquinones) of Aloes are excreted in the large intestine and are of greatest value in those animals that suffer from impaction of the large intestine. The horse with its numerous colon flexures and its decrease in diameter at the pelvic flexure benefits from this type of purgative. Purgation in the horse is delayed for at least 18 hours. In other animals, the action is far more rapid (Daykin, 1960) . The glycosides are metabolized by glycosidases in the intestinal flora to form active anthrones. The laxative action is due to increased motility of the large intestine attained by inhibition of the Na + /K + pump and chloride ion channels; enhanced fluid secretion occurs because of stimulation of secretion of mucus and chloride ion (ESCP, 1997). SENNA POD (CASSIA ANGUSTIFOLIA): At very small doses, this herb produces sublaxative effects, whereby bowel motions are made comfortable, normal, and soft. At larger doses, it produces a laxative or purgative effect. The effects of sennosides on colonic motility were investigated in eight conscious dogs. Oral sennosides (30 mg/kg) inhibited colonic motility for 12 to 18 hours after a 3-to 6-hour delay and were associated with giant contractions and diarrhea. The minimal oral dose of sennosides needed to produce such changes varied from 5 to 15 mg/kg. Intracolonic sennosides at the minimal effective dose and at 30 mg/kg reproduced the effects of oral sennosides, but with a shorter latency (0.5-1.5 h). This study suggested that colonic motor actions of sennosides are mediated through local prostaglandin synthesis because they were blocked by cyclooxygenase inhibitor and reproduced by PGE 2 (Staumont, 1988) .",

In older patients and those with chronic joint disease, muscle spasm is a dramatic but rarely recognized clinical finding.

There may be reason to connect toxin accumulation with pain and inflammation, and the more modern concept of \"leaky gut\" can explain why herbalists generally direct some efforts toward normalizing gut function, as well as directly addressing joint and muscle pain and inflammation. Leaky gut occurs in animals that may be older and stressed because of chronic pain or disease, especially when steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (which may often lead to mucosal inflammation) change normal gut permeability. When the gut mucosa is altered in this way, large proteins such as food as well as bacterial, and self antigens may gain access to the submucosa and possibly even the portal circulation. The normal gut is responsible for making primary immune responses, but it also makes significant neuroendocrine responses, including the production of serotonin, benzodiazepines, glutamate, enkephalins, nitric oxide, and dopamine. The end clinical response is increased immune responsiveness, systemic inflammation and perhaps altered behavior (Figure 20 -2).",

Of 24 eligible dogs, the investigators believed that 71% of them showed improvement. A statistically significant reduction in severity and resolution of typical clinical signs, such as intermittent lameness, local pain, and stiff gait reported after 6 weeks, were observed in individual animals; however, no control group was included. Adverse effects were rare and mild, consisting only of brief episodes of diarrhea and flatulence (Reichling, 2004) .",

For example, an herbalist might prescribe a nervine to calm and sedate a patient who exhibits hyperactivity or anxiety, or a nervine may be prescribed for a depressed patient, to restore a sense of well-being. In veterinary neurology, one of the most important contributions that herbal medicine can make is in \"strengthening\" the nervous system. Nervines can be broadly classified into three main groups, although many nervine herbs have overlapping activity. 1. Nervine relaxants have sedating, hypnotic, or calming and anxiolytic activity, and many have antispasmodic activity. Relaxant nervines are prescribed for anxiety, hyperactivity, and sleeplessness and restlessness. They include herbs such as valerian, lavender, hops, passionflower, and lemon balm. Nervine relaxants include antispasmodic nervines that are prescribed for muscle cramping or twitches, such as smooth muscle spasm of the colon, bronchi, stomach, bladder, and so forth. An example is chamomile, which is used for painful spasm of the gastrointestinal tract. 2. Nervine stimulants may be beneficial in a depressed or hypoactive nervous system. Rarely needed in veterinary medicine, these herbs are widely used by people and include coffee, tea, cola (kola nut), and guarana; all can induce anxiety and tension. Stimulating nervines are prescribed for low-energy states, lethargy, and depression. Saint John's wort can be useful for mild depression; also, this group may include the cognition-enhancing herbs outlined later. 3. Nervine tonics can restore tissues directly (see later) by contributing to tissue repair, or they may help reduce the effects of undue stress on the body; these include adaptogens, nervine trophorestoratives, and most herbs that reduce anxiety and stress. One example is Ginkgo biloba, which appears to work by promoting vasodilation in the brain, thus improving oxygenation to brain tissue. Others include Saint John's wort and Oats.",

The Eclectics preferred a powdered extract called lupulin, and found it much more reliable. Early laboratory animal and human clinical studies showed no sedative effects (Hansel, 1967; Stocker, 1967) . Later studies showed that one auto-oxidation product had strong sedative properties in animals (Wohlfart, 1983; H\u00e4nsel, 1980; Wohlfart, 1982) . This is an aromatic principle, and the authors warned that it may be present in traditional hops pillows, but not in many herb extracts. However, it has also been suggested that isovaleric acid residues present in hops may contribute to its sedative action in mice.

Sitoindosides VII through X and withaferin-A were studied on brain cholinergic, glutamatergic, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic receptors in rats. Results suggested that the compounds preferentially affect events in the cortical and basal forebrain cholinergic signal transduction cascade. The druginduced increase in cortical muscarinic acetylcholine receptor capacity might explain in part the cognitionenhancing and memory-improving effects of extracts from Withania somnifera observed in animals and humans (Schliebs, 1997) . GABA binding was inhibited by 20% with 5 \u03bcg Withania root extract and completely by 1 mg. This extract increased Cl influx, which was blocked by bicuculline and picrotoxin and was enhanced by diazepam. These results suggest that the W. somnifera extract contains an ingredient that has a GABA-mimetic activity (Mehta, 1991) .

It was also used as an antispasmodic, and Cook's Physiomedical Dispensatory (1869) calls it a \"diffuse nervine and antispasmodic of much service.\" Laboratory animal studies have produced somewhat conflicting results regarding sleep time and activity. Two studies suggest that components of catnip have some sedative activity. Catnip oil (500 mg/kg) and nepetalic acid (62.5 mg/kg) were found to significantly increase sleep time in mice. Rats showed a significant decrease in performance in avoidance studies after intraperitoneal injections of catnip oil (500-750 mg/kg), nepetalic acid (125-250 mg/kg), and the nepetalactone-enriched fraction (500-750 mg/kg) (Harney, 1978) . The alcohol extract of catnip showed a biphasic effect on the behavior of young chicks, increasing the number of chicks who slept at low and moderate doses (25-1800 mg/kg), while high dose levels (i.e., above 2 g/kg) led fewer chicks to sleep (Sherry, 1979) . On the other hand, Massoco and colleagues (1995) fed mice catnip at 10% of their dietary intake and discovered amphetamine-like activity. A case report described a single child who ate a large amount of catnip and was obtunded (Osterhoudt, 1997) . Aydin (1998) determined that nepetalactone (a component of Nepeta cataria and other species of Nepeta) had specific activity at some opioid receptor subtypes. Unique behavioral reactions of cats have been observed in the presence of catnip. The chemosensory stimulus evoking the catnip reaction is undoubtedly mediated through the main olfactory system. These behaviors, include sniffing and chewing as associated with oral appetitive behavior, rolling and rubbing characteristic of female sexual behavior, batting the catnip source characteristic of play behavior, and a type of kicking associated with predatory behavior. These behavioral reactions occur randomly and intermittently (Hart, 1985) .",

Studies in rats and mice have shown sedative and anticonvulsant activities for whole plant extracts, as well as for valerenic acids, valepotriates, and the volatile oil (Schulz, 2001) .

The Eclectics mentioned that it had sedative properties but did not make much use of the plant for this purpose. A modern application may be its use in the treatment of obsessivecompulsive disorder. The mechanism of action of Saint John's wort is postulated to be inhibition of the synaptosomal uptake of serotonin. Twelve subjects were evaluated with a primary diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder of at least 12 months' duration. Treatment lasted for 12 weeks, with a dose of 450 mg of 0.3% hypericin twice daily. Weekly and monthly evaluations were conducted. A significant change from baseline to endpoint was found, which occurred at 1 week and continued to increase throughout the trial. At endpoint, 5 of 12 were rated much or very much improved, 6 were minimally improved, and 1 had no change (Taylor, 2000) .

Patients were allocated in a random fashion for a 4-week trial: 18 to the Passionflower 45 drops/day plus placebo tablet group, and 18 to the oxazepam 30 mg/day plus placebo drops group. Both were effective in the treatment of patients with generalized anxiety disorder with no significant difference between the two protocols. Oxazepam showed a rapid onset of action but significantly more problems related to impairment of job performance. The results suggested that Passionflower is an effective drug for the management of generalized anxiety disorder with a low incidence of impaired job performance (Akhondzadeh, 2001b) .

The mechanisms thought to be operative include blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels, enhanced GABA A receptor binding, diminished excitatory neurotransmitter release due to calcium channel blockade, reduced neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine, monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibition, and thromboxane A2 synthesis suppression, the latter of which antagonizes GABA A receptor function (Singh, 2002) . The Eclectics did not seem to recognize this herb as anxiolytic but did note painrelieving properties and diuresis. Felter listed the specific indications as \"irritation, inflammation, or debility of the urinary passages; chronic catarrhal inflammations; vesical irritation and inflammation; vesical atony; painful micturition, strangury, and dysuria.\" With consideration of its accepted anxiolytic properties and traditional indications for diuresis, urinary tract pain, and inflammation, kava seems particularly appropriate for cases of feline interstitial cystitis, in addition to short-term use for other conditions in which anxiety is present.",

Compared with controls, rats treated with the combination preparation (mixture ratio of ginger extract to ginkgo extract, 2.5 : 1; 1 mg/kg, intragastrically) spent increased amounts of time in the open arms of the maze, whereas the behavior of rats treated with preparations of mixture ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2.5 did not change (Hasen\u00f6rhl, 1998) . Zingicomb, a preparation consisting of ginger and Ginkgo biloba extracts, administered intragastrically has anxiolytic-like properties. A study assessed the effects of acute treatment with this preparation on inhibitory avoidance learning. The influence of zingicomb on avoidance conditioning was investigated in rats treated intragastrically with vehicle or 0.5, 1, 10, or 100 mg/kg zingicomb 60 minutes before the trial. When tested 24 hours after training, rats that had received 10 mg/kg zingicomb exhibited significantly longer step-through latencies than did vehicle-treated animals. In contrast to conventional anxiolytic drugs, which tend to have amnesic properties, zingicomb is a potent anxiolytic agent that may facilitate performance on a learning task (Topic, 2002) .",

Results showed only slight differences in anesthetic efficiency and physiologic effects, and suggested that clove oil does not block cortisol response to stress in fish, as do other anesthetics (Tort, 2002; Vykusova, 2003) . In a similar study, clove oil (85%-95% eugenol) was only slightly less effective than quinaldine and more effective than benzocaine, MS-222, and 2-phenoxyethanol. Clove oil had a much calmer induction to anesthesia than did quinaldine, along with a recovery time that was 2 to 3 times longer (Munday, 1997) . The anesthetic effects of clove oil-derived eugenol were studied in juvenile rainbow trout. Times to induction and recovery from anesthesia were measured and compared with those of MS-222. Eugenol induced anesthesia faster and at lower concentrations than did MS-222, and recovery times for eugenol were 6 to 10 times longer. Clove oil eugenol was determined to be an acceptable anesthetic for use in aquaculture and aquatic research. It was found that 40 to 60 ppm eugenol induced rapid anesthesia, with a relatively short time for recovery in juvenile trout (Keene, 1998) . Juvenile rabbitfish were anesthetized and their length and weight recorded on three separate occasions. Fish were fed shortly afterward, and no mortality was observed. Clove oil appeared to be highly effective as a fish anesthetic with potentially few or no adverse effects (Soto, 1995) .",

The adaptogenic effect is nonspecific in that the adaptogen increases resistance to a very broad spectrum of harmful factors (\"stressors\") of different physical, chemical, and biological natures; 2. An adaptogen is said to have a normalizing effect, that is, it counteracts or prevents disturbances brought about by stressors; and 3. An adaptogen must be innocuous to have a broad range of therapeutic effects without causing any disturbance (other than very marginally) to the normal functioning of the organism. More recently, a theory has been advanced to explain that changing levels of mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), platelet-activating factor (PAF), catecholamines, cortisol, and PGE 2 are held in tighter homeostatic control, unlike the wide swings that a normal stress response brings with it (Panossian, 1999) .",

Mouse studies also suggest that Eleuthero can enhance cellular and humoral immunity (Rogala, 2003) . Elderly human patients given Eleuthero experienced temporary improvements in social functioning that were measured at 4 weeks but did not last to 8 weeks of the trial (Cicero, 2004) . Hartz and associates examined 96 people with chronic fatigue who had been given Eleuthero or placebo and found no statistically significant differences between groups (Hartz, 2004) . Some animal studies and one human study in athletes (Gaffney, 2001) showed that Eleuthero actually increased hormonal indices of stress.

Saint John's wort standardized to 0.3% hypericin content was administered for 9 weeks in doses of 4.3 and 13 \u03bcg/kg, corresponding to therapeutic dosages in humans of 0.3 and 0.9 mg of total hypericins daily.

Treatment led to an extended period of sexual activity and improvement of semen production in rams over the service period. Results of Tribestan therapy with rams with reduced libido showed that the animals could recover with no morphologic changes in the structure of the testes and epididymides. The use of this preparation raised the testosterone level and normalized the sexual activity of rams affected by impotence (Dimitrov, 1987) . Tribestan increased testosterone levels and accelerated sexual development in rams and male lambs, respectively (Georgiev, 1988) . Libido and sexual reflexes were restored in boars with long-term sexual impotence (Zarkova, 1984) .",

It has been suggested that the effects of EGb 761 in the experimental animal models described previously may involve aspects of neuronal plasticity (e.g., neuronal regeneration) (DeFeudis, 1998). Ischemia-induced lipid peroxidation is one of the most important causes of tissue damage in spinal cord injury. In one study, the protective effects of Ginkgo biloba, thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH), and methylprednisolone on compression injury of the rat spinal cord were investigated. Ginkgo biloba treatments significantly decreased malondialdehyde levels, which suggests that methylprednisolone and Ginkgo biloba may provide protection against ischemic spinal cord injury through the antioxidant effect (Koc, 1995) . In another study, when pretreatment with a ginkgo extract was given 7 days before induced ischemia, followed by reperfusion, treated rabbits had only a slight tremor in the hind limbs compared with completely paraplegic controls. This study indicated that the ginkgo extract can scavenge free radicals produced during ischemia/reperfusion and may reduce reperfusion damage (Mechirova, 2002) .",

Animals that had undergone surgery received daily oral administration of vehicle or herbal extracts, alone or in combination, for 7 and 21 days, respectively. Treatment with American ginseng, ginkgo extract, or Saint John's wort alone failed to offer neuroprotection to injured retinal ganglion cells. However, treatment with a mixture of American ginseng, ginkgo extract, or Saint John's wort significantly augmented retinal ganglion cells survival 7 days postaxotomy. Treatment with the combination also induced a significant increase in the number of regenerating RGCs 21 days after optic nerve transection. This study suggests that herbs can act as potential neuroprotective agents for damaged retinal ganglion cells and that the therapeutic value of herbal remedies may be maximized through the use of mixtures of appropriate herbs (Cheung, 2002) .",

Treatment led to an extended period of sexual activity and to improved semen production in rams over the service period. Rams with reduced libido recovered by the seventh or eighth day with no morphologic changes in the structure of both testes and epididymides. The use of this preparation led to changes in the endocrine activity of the testis, raising the testosterone level and normalizing the sexual activity of rams affected with coital impotence (Dimitrov, 1987) . Tribestan increased testosterone levels and accelerated sexual development in rams and male lambs, respectively (Georgiev, 1988) .

In the seaweed group, the incidence of mastitis was markedly reduced (90% in the control group); the number of services needed per conception was decreased and the number of no returns was increased; and a marked increase was seen in the iodine content of milk.

The syrup is used as a menstruum for the administration of other remedies in this disease. It is excellent also in reflex cough-the cough of nervous patients without apparent cause.\" The US Dispensatory (Remington, 1918) stated that hydrocyanic acid was believed to be the active principle, but wild cherry bark was not believed to be very effective. The dose recommended for people was 30 to 60 grains (1.9-3.8 g). Winslow states that the official products (fluid extract and syrup) were often used in cough mixtures for dogs, but that the official hydrocyanic acid was more reliable. Milks (1949) recommends doses of 2 mL of the fluid extract for dogs, or 4 mL of the syrup.",

The Asthma & Allergy Research Group at the University of Dundee has completed multiple human clinical trials undertaken to investigate the effects of butterbur extracts in allergic respiratory disease. Using the patented butterbur extract Petaforce \u00ae (50 mg twice daily), they compared the extract with placebo in patients challenged with adenosine monophosphate. In two randomized, double blind, crossover trials, butterbur effectively suppressed the signs of allergic rhinitis (Lee, 2004b; Lee, 2003) ; in another trial, it was ineffective (Gray, 2004) . Tesalin \u00ae was used by another group and was compared with cetirizine in a double-blind, parallelgroup trial. Tesalin contains the equivalent of 8 mg petasins per tablet. Similar improvements were noted in the two groups, and although butterbur use was not associated with adverse effects, the cetirizine group reported sedation as a common adverse effect (Schapowal, 2002) . Petaforce \u00ae was also investigated for use in atopic asthmatic human patients who were already being treated with corticosteroid inhalers; it was found to be significantly beneficial as a complement to steroid use in a double-blind, crossover trial (Lee, 2004a) . The proprietary product Petadolex \u00ae was administered to 80 asthmatic patients for 2 months in an open trial, and the number of asthmatic attacks, peak flow, and forced expiratory volume were measured. All symptoms improved during therapy, and more than 40% of patients were able to reduce their intake of other asthma medications (Danesch, 2004) . Butterbur had no effect on skin test reactions to histamine (Jackson, 2004) . Butterbur contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids and should not be used as crude herb or crude extract. The products mentioned here have been processed to remove the pyrrolizidine alkaloids, according to the manufacturers.

A protective effect is exerted by ginkgolides on platelet-activating factor (PAF)-induced bronchoconstriction and airway hyperactivity. Oral or intravenous injection of ginkgolide B antagonizes cardiovascular impairments and bronchoconstriction induced by PAF. Ginkgolide B does not appear to interfere with cyclooxygenase, but it does have an effect in an earlier step involving PAF receptors and phospholipase activation. Eosinophil infiltration occurs in asthma and in allergic reactions, the number of eosinophils increasing during late phase. Because PAF is a potent activator of eosinophil function, it has been argued that ginkgolide B may interfere with the late-phase response (Hosford, 1988) . A randomized, double-blind, crossover study involved patients with atopic asthma who were challenged with a specific dust or pollen antigen. After 6.5 hours, participants were subjected to a provocation test with acetylcholine. Mixed ginkgolide standardized extract, 40 mg three times daily, or placebo was given during the 3 days before the test, and a final single dose of 120 mg of extract was given 2 hours before the challenge. Results suggested that ginkgolides were effective in both the early phase and the late phase of airway hyperactivity (Braquet, 1987) .",

A simple observation has been made that vomiting is preceded by salivation and nausea-but also by respiratory secretions. Ancient medical strategies to reduce phlegm in the respiratory tract concentrate on abnormalities in digestive function. This related reflex is not surprising when one considers the common embryologic origin of the bronchial and alimentary epithelium, as well as the shared vagal innervation. Herbs that cause expectoration do so by one of two mechanisms. Reflex expectorants irritate gastric mucosa, and some (like ipecac, Cephaelis) are used most often as emetics. Herbs that contain saponins (mullein, licorice, ivy, cowslip, senega snakeroot, and soap bark) probably stimulate the gastric mucosa. Mucolytic herbs increase the water content of respiratory mucus.",

It is no surprise that traditional herbal medicine \"diuretics\" played an important role in the treatment of urinary tract disorders. However, the term diuretic in herbal medicine is not the same as that in conventional medicine; it can be used in a number of other ways. Traditionally, herbs were given as a decoction or infusion for urinary conditions, and the additional water consumption would have produced an observable diuresis. Hence, many herbs were classified as diuretics, whether they had genuine diuretic action or not. The \"flushing\" of the bladder naturally assisted in the treatment of cystitis. This strategy can also be employed in treating animals. Simply encouraging animals to drink more water or broth may accomplish the same end. Nonetheless, in many traditional herbal writings, diuretics were herbs that were considered to enhance excretion of waste through the kidneys (perhaps better classed as \"diuretic depuratives\"); they included herbs like Dandelion leaf (Taraxacum officinale), Cleavers (Gallium aparine), Burdock (Arctium lappa), Red clover (Trifolium pretense), Heartsease (Viola tricolor), and Celery (Apium graveolens). Improving elimination through other systems of the body with the use of these alteratives and diuretics was another important strategy that aided one of the most important elimination systems-the urinary tract.",

In addition, a decrease was noted in the relative supersaturation of calcium oxalate, which tended to be significantly lower than that induced by water alone. It was concluded that cranberry juice has antilithogenic properties (McHarg, 2003) . However, cranberry juice has a moderately high concentration of oxalate, a common component of kidney stones in humans. In five healthy volunteers, urinary oxalate levels in volunteers significantly increased by an average of 43.4% while they were receiving cranberry tablets.

A crude extract at 100 mg/kg given orally to rats significantly reduced stone formation (81%) (Prabhakar, 1997) . The effects of oral administration of Crataeva nurvala bark decoction on calcium oxalate lithiasis have been studied in rats. Crataeva reduced the oxalate-synthesizing liver enzyme, glycolate oxidase, which is produced by the feeding of glycolic acid; this caused a regulatory action on endogenous oxalate synthesis. Increased deposition of stone-forming constituents in the kidneys of calculogenic rats was lowered with decoction administration. Increased urinary excretion of the crystalline constituents, along with lowered magnesium excretion, in stone-forming rats was partially reversed by decoction treatment (Varalakshmi, 1990) . Among 46 human patients with calcium oxalate stones that used 50 mL decoction twice daily for between 1 and 47 weeks, 28 passed the stone and 18 experienced symptomatic relief. This is thought to be due to the tonic contractile action of the drug on smooth muscle (Deshpande, 1982) . Stem bark decoction was used in patients with calcium oxalate stones. After 12 weeks, a significant reduction in pain and dysuria was observed, along with some reduction in the size of stones (Singh, 1991) .",

Initially, it was thought that the antibacterial effect of cranberry juice was a result of its ability to acidify urine and, therefore, to inhibit bacterial growth. However, recent work has focused on the effects of cranberry in inhibiting bacterial adherence and on the effects of antiadhesion agents in cranberry juice. Bacterial adherence to mucosal surfaces is considered to be an important step in the development of urinary tract infection (Reid, 1987) . It is facilitated by fimbriae on the bacterial cell wall, which produce adhesins that attach to specific receptors on uroepithelial cells (Beachey, 1981) . Proanthocyanidins extracted from cranberries have been shown to inhibit the adherence of P-fimbriated Escherichia coli to uroepithelial cell surfaces, suggesting that proanthocyanidins may be important for the stated effects of cranberry in urinary tract infection (Howell, 1998) . Cranberry juice cocktail provided antiadherence activity directed toward gram-negative rods, including Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Proteus species (Schmidt, 1988) . In a review of two randomized controlled trials, it was found that cranberry (as juice or capsule) significantly reduced the incidence of urinary tract infection in women. Evidence supports the use of cranberry to prevent urinary tract infection in some populations, but none to support its use as a treatment (Griffiths, 2003) .",

Traditionally, it has been used for cystitis, urethritis, dysuria, pyelitis, lithuria, and, specifically, acute catarrhal cystitis with dysuria and highly acidic urine (British Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 1983; Wren, 1988) . The antiseptic and diuretic properties claimed for uva ursi can be attributed to its hydroquinone derivatives, especially the constituent arbutin. Arbutin is absorbed intact from the gastrointestinal tract and during renal excretion is hydrolyzed to yield the active principle, hydroquinone, which exerts antiseptic and astringent actions on the urinary mucous membranes (Matsuda, 1992b) . In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, 57 women with more than three episodes of cystitis in the previous year received herbal extract or placebo. The herbal medicine consisted of bearberry and dandelion root and leaf. Treatment for 1 month significantly reduced the recurrence of cystitis during the 1-year follow-up, with no cystitis in the treated group and 23% recurrence in the placebo group. No adverse effects were reported (Larsson, 1993) . It should be noted that alkaline urine is necessary for arbutin to work. Urinary acidifiers inhibit the conversion of arbutin to an active hydroquinone, making uva ursi less effective (De Smet, 1993) .",

Beta-sitosterol administration resulted in 70% protection; this is a common plant sterol contained in Yarrow (Achillea millefolium), Calendula (Calendula officinalis), Cynanchum paniculatum, Eclipta prostrata, Ocimum basilicum, Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), and many other herbs. Hydroxybenzoic acids and their methyl esters gave up to 83% protection. Plants that contain these acids include Bistort (Polygonum bistorta), Gentian (Gentiana lutea), and Perilla ternata. Coumarins gave 40% protection, and many flavonoids provided 40% to 80% survival. Secondary metabolites of plants appear to interact with snake venom proteins, either by blocking receptors, chelating enzymes, or inhibiting enzymes in other ways.",
