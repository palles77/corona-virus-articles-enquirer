Proteases regulate much of what occurs in the human body including the essential cellular functions of differentiation, motility, division, and cell death. Proteases participate physiologically in intracellular protein-degradation processes using several systems, including lysosomes (membrane-bound organelles containing proteases) and the more recently characterized proteasome system, consisting of very large protein barrel-like stacked four-ringed complexes, the outer rings of which function as gates to proteins entering the central pore, while the interior surfaces of the inner rings contain the proteolytic active sites. 9 Proteasome proteolytic mechanisms involve an active site threonine, and involve three different chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing substrate specificities. Proteolysis is exploited physiologically for covalent activation, regulation, and inhibition of enzymes and other protein-based or linked effectors, for example, in the biochemical cascade leading to blood clotting and in production of insulin. Proteases remove signal sequences of peptides following their transport/secretion through membranes and they remove N-terminal methionine residues after translation.",

Because proteases also function as causative agents of some diseases, protease inhibitors have also been developed as a class of therapeutics. Commercial fermentation processes for production of microbial proteases were developed from about the 1950s. Some of the workhorse protease-producing strains, including Aspergillus, Rhizopus, and Bacillus species, were the same species as were found in traditional fermented food fermentations where their proteases participated in the degradation of proteins and associated development of distinct flavors in solid mash substrates containing soy beans, cereal grains, and other plant-based food materials. The protease production fermentation processes and conditions were optimized through characterization and control of factors affecting microbial growth and enzyme production. Overproducing strains were isolated through extensive screening processes and were further improved through application of elaborate mutation/selection procedures. Developments in genetic engineering, including the ability to express recombinant proteins in different host organisms and the ability to manipulate and enhance transcription, translation, secretion, and other processes, have been exploited to enhance protease production and underlining the technoeconomics of their use. The ability to engineer proteins to modify properties, such as kinetics, specificity, and stability, has been applied to improve or expand on protease applications. Random and site-directed mutagenesis and other techniques have been particularly useful in designing, constructing, and characterizing the biocatalytic and stability properties of wholly new protease structures.",

Companies reported to have the largest share of the enzyme market are Novozymes ), with respective approximate market shares of 41%-44%, 21%, and 8%. Some Japanese Companies including Shin Nihon continue to produce and commercialize enzymes using the solid culture (koji) process (http://www.aichi-brand.jp/corporate/type/chemical/shin-nihon-e. html). The Amano Enzyme Group produces a more specialized range of enzymes with major applications in biotransformations, diagnostics, and as dietary supplements (http://www.amano-enzyme.co.jp/aeu/product/presentation.html). The indicated internet sites and others provide valuable information on the principal applications of proteases as well as on new research, technology, and links to technical reports and publications. Other companies mainly based in Asia, Europe, and North America account for the residual approximately 27%-30%. Proteases are thought to account for about 60% of the total enzyme market or $1.5-1.8 billion per year. Among protease applications, the most dominant use is in the detergents accounting for sales of alkaline protease of approximately $1 billion per year.",

It should be noted that there is some overlap in the data since patents applied for and granted since 2001 will be counted under both headers. 'Protease' was used as the initial 'term' in the search, which was separately applied to the fields 'abstract' and 'claims'. In a second search, the search term 'protease inhibitor' was used. The presumption is that the difference between these two numbers, that is, proteases but not 'protease inhibitors', provides a good indication of numbers of granted patents and applications involving proteases. In the past 10 years, nearly 6000 patents have been filed with claims dealing with protease.",

For a more detailed discussion of reaction mechanisms the reader is also referred to Rao et al., 12 Ward et al., 20 and Fujinami and Fujisawa. 3 The principal enzyme types are exoproteases, which act at or near the ends of the peptide chains, delineated as aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases to indicate their action is at the N-or C-terminals of the peptide substrates. These enzymes may be further differentiated depending on the size of the moiety that is cleaved off, be it, for example, an amino acid, a dipeptide, or a tripeptide. Industrial organisms known to produce aminopeptidases include Aspergillus oryzae, Bacillus licheniformis, Botulinum stearothermophilus, and Escherichia coli. Carboxypeptidases, which are produced by species such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Saccharomyces species, are differentiated further into three groups based on the presence of certain amino acid substituents at their active sites, namely the serine carboxyproteases, the metallocarboxyproteases, and the cysteine carboxyproteases.",

Serine endoproteases, having a serine residue at their active sites which participates in the catalytic reaction, have broad specificities and indeed these enzymes catalyze hydrolytic reactions involving esters and amides as well as peptides. Important wellknown enzymes of this subgroup include the chymotrypsins and the subtilisins. Many serine proteases have high pH optima in the range 7-12, with those in the pH range 9-10 being known as serine alkaline proteases or the first generation of detergent proteases and those with pH optima of 11-12 being known as the high alkaline proteases, the second generation of detergent proteases. The subtilisins are an important family of serine proteases produced by Bacillus species. These enzymes were also the starting material for development of a third generation of detergent enzymes, resistant to oxidation by bleach and related detergent oxidants, which involved substitution of an oxidation-sensitive amino acid near the enzyme's active site with an oxidation-resistant amino acid. These enzymes are further discussed under commercial Bacillus proteases below. 2. Aspartic endoproteases have low pH optima (3) (4) , contain a pair of aspartic acid residues at their active sites, and are sorted into two groups: pepsins and pepsin-like enzymes (e.g., produced by Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Rhizopus species) and rennet and rennet-like enzymes (e.g., produced by Mucor pusillus, M. Miehei, and Endothia species). 3. Cysteine/thiol endoproteases contain a cysteine-histidine dyad at their catalytic sites and generally require reducing agents for retention of catalytic activity and are denatured or inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents. Subgroups include papain and papain-like enzymes (including clostripain and streptopain from Clostridium histolyticum and Streptomyces species, respectively). 4. Metalloendoproteases. Biocatalysis requires the presence of a bound divalent cation. These enzymes are inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid but not by sulfhydryl reagents or diisopropylfluorophosphate. The highly thermostable neutral zinc protease produced by B. stearothermophilus, thermolysin, is a well-known member of this subgroup.

            "text": "Enzymes have been extracted from animal sources since ancient times where milk being carried in calf stomachs was observed to clot (due to the activity of calf rennet or chymosin). The best source of the enzyme is the fourth stomach of unweaved calves, where it is present together with pepsin, but the ratio of pepsin to rennet is low. In Denmark, Christian Hansen started commercial production of chymosin by extracting calf stomach with saline. Similar approaches were used to produce bovine pepsin. Typically, the enzyme-containing tissues are preserved at the slaughterhouse by salting, freezing, or drying. Salted stomachs may be washed and dried prior to rennet extraction. The dried calf stomach may be sliced, blended or ground, and extracted with water containing 5%-10% NaCl to produce what is known as single-strength rennet. Concentration of the single-strength liquid product using ultrafiltration is used to produce double-or triple-strength rennet. Plant proteolytic enzymes, such as papain from Carica papaya and bromelain from the pineapple family Bromeliaceae, have also been produced commercially. In the case of bromelain, the stem component of the pineapple plant after harvesting of the fruit is peeled, crushed, and pressed to recover a juice extract containing the soluble bromelain enzyme. Papain is obtained from the green fruit. The latex is released by making incisions in the fruit, which is laden with liquid in the early morning. The latex tends to congeal on the surface of the fruit from which it may be collected. The collected gel-like latex may be dried on trays at temperatures up to 55 C using forced air or alternatively it may be liquefied, filtered, and spray dried to produce the crude enzyme. Further purification may involve water extraction and solvent precipitation. Carbohydrate/plant gum-depolymerizing enzymes may be added to remove cloud and viscous plant polysaccharides from crude aqueous extracts. During processing, or when the final product is in the form of a liquid, the labile active site sulfhydryl groups are protected by addition of sodium bisulfite.",

The generally accepted amount of alpha-amino nitrogen requirement for yeast growth in a normal fermentation is 140-180 mg L \u00c01 . In an all malt mash, the malt proteases typically produce the requisite amount of amino nitrogen from the principal proteins of barley, hordein and glutelin, both during the malting process and during mashing. As the proportion of malt is decreased or eliminated through use of unmalted cereals there is a requirement to replace the malt protease with industrial proteases, especially neutral proteases from Bacillus and also from Aspergillus species. Bacillus alkaline protease is not effective for this application. These enzymes may also be used for production of cereal extract concentrates, where filterable extract yield is the priority rather than amino nitrogen and, in this case, papain may also be used to promote proteolysis. It should also be noted that the temperature-time holds during mashing are designed to meet the activity requirements of the mashing enzymes including protease, amylases, and glucanases. In mashing with malt enzymes, the lowest temperature hold is around 50 C, called the 'proteolytic' stand as malt proteases have temperature optima around this setting and quickly get denatured as the temperature is increased. Some of the microbial proteases and papain have higher temperature optima at 55-65 C, enabling the mashing process to be implemented at high temperatures that are more optimal for starch gelatinization and hydrolysis of starch and betaglucans.",

There are now three types of commercial milk-coagulating enzymes: animal rennets, microbial rennets, and genetically engineered calf rennet (chymosin), the latter two being developed due to a world shortage of calf rennet as a result of the substantial increases over the years in cheese production. The uniqueness of rennet as a protease is its extremely high substrate specificity, in that it hydrolyzes a single-specific peptide bond (Phe105-Met106) in the k-casein fraction of milk, to produce para-k-casein and a macropeptide, without attacking other caseins. As k-casein serves to maintain the milk micelles in suspension, whereas neither the para-k-casein nor a macropeptide serves this function, cleavage of this bond by rennet results in destabilization of the milk micelles and cheese coagulation.",

At this point, rennet is added to affect coagulation. Thus, a unique property of rennet is its very high ratio of milk clotting to general proteolytic activity and the challenge in searching for microbial rennets was to find enzymes that approached this characteristic activity ratio. Many of the candidates tended to have higher proteolytic activity that manifested itself in the production of weaker curds or in softening of the cheese over time in storage.",

The dough-making process can be accelerated by addition of proteases to partially hydrolyze the gluten. For example, weak gluten flour is needed for biscuit making but is difficult to source. This problem may be resolved by protease-catalyzed degradation of gluten in more readily obtainable high gluten-containing flour. Typically, heat-labile fungal proteases are used for gluten hydrolysis in baking, such that the enzyme denatures as temperature rises in the early stages of baking.

Many types of proteins, including soy protein, gelatin, caseins, and whey proteins may be modified using proteases. Fish and meat hydrolysates are prepared using proteases, and proteases may also be used for meat tenderization. Indeed, natural meat tenderization mediated by endogenous proteases in the muscle after animal slaughter is known to occur. Proteases may be used to recover proteins from bones during animal rendering, which in turn may be incorporated into canned soups, sauces, and meats, especially cured meats and sausages. Microbial proteases, especially the Bacillus alkaline serine proteases, have long been used for preparation of protein hydrolysates. However, neutral proteases, for example, from B. licheniformis are also used for this application. Where protein hydrolysis is implemented under more acidic conditions, proteases from fungi such as A. oryzae and Rhizopus niveus and related strains are more frequently applied. Protein hydrolysates, after enzyme hydrolysis, may be used in human food formulations, including in infant formula and in animal feeds, or the protease may be added to the protein-containing food or feed, enabling proteolysis to take place during further processing of the food or feed.

The bitterness is often attributed to terminal hydrophobic amino acids of the peptides produced, but nonterminal hydrophobic amino acids in small-to medium-sized oligopeptides may also exhibit a bitter taste, whereas larger peptides appear nonbitter. Bitter tastes have been observed in some cheese-making processes and were attributed to a protease derived from Pseudomonas R098.

Soaking generally involves addition of alkali solutions that are applied to swell the hide. Application of high alkali concentrations combined with a hydrogen sulfide treatment step for protein hair root solubilization contributes to conventional chemical removal of hair and/or wool from hides. As occurs in other industries, there is a strong move away from use of harsh chemicals in processing because of the associated safety risks to workers handling these materials. Also, these methods add significant high costs to effluent treatment and waste disposal and increase risks of spills and pollution. Therefore, more environmentally friendly approaches are desirable and proteases can fill this niche. Protease application in leather processing, thus, reduces the safety, higher handling, and disposal costs associated with chemical treatments. Furthermore, the potential to apply proteases to selectively attack noncollagenous protein constituents offers the opportunity to enhance leather quality over and above what is achievable through chemical treatment.",

More recently, hydrolytic enzymes have been applied for catalysis of reactions involving water as reactant or product, whereby the water concentration in the reaction medium is partially or wholly replaced by another solvent, thereby shifting the reaction equilibrium in favor of synthesis. As water molecules may also participate in maintaining the requisite conformational structure of proteins for biocatalysis, much research has been directed to understanding the impact of water, and indeed water concentration on enzyme activity and stability and the associated impact of implementing enzyme reactions in nonconventional organic media or biphasic aqueous-organic systems. In addition, enzymes have been identified or engineered to be more stable in organic solvents. For example, a microbial protease from Thermus strain Rt4A2 is very stable in organic solvents. Subtilisin has been rendered more stable in organic solvents by covalent modification of the enzyme using selected polymers or by application of covalent or noncovalent methods to bind the enzyme to supports. The research of Chen and Arnold (reviewed by Kuchner and Arnold 5 ) applied the tools and concepts of directed evolution to developing subtilisin proteases that were active in the presence of organic solvents and, hence, applicable to using proteases catalyze synthesis of peptides and related bonds. Protease PST-01 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which exhibits a high level of homology to thermolysin, also contains a disulfide bond (one of two), which contributes substantially to its solvent stability. Another approach to replacing water in the reaction medium is to use supercritical fluids as the reaction solvent. These topics are discussed in detail in two excellent texts edited by Patel. 10, 11 The following are some examples of the applications of proteases in bioorganic synthesis:",

The capacity of proteases to synthesize di-and oligopeptides by coupling of peptide esters to N-protected amino acids was exploited by Toya Soda Company Japan for aspartame (L-phe-L-asp-methyl ester) synthesis, mediated by thermolysin from B. thermoproteolyticus. The immobilized thermolysin catalyzes formation of aspartame through reaction of L-aspartyl-methyl ester with L-phenylalanine containing an amino group blocking agent, after which the blocking agent may be removed chemically. 2. Prolyl-endopeptidase from Flavobacterium meningoseptum, a thermostable protease from C. thermohydrosulfuricum, and pronase from Streptomyces griseus have been used for synthesis of various peptides. 3. Proteases, such as subtilisin and clostripain, have been used in glycoconjugate synthesis. Strategies included participation of the enzyme directly in acylation of the carbohydrate or in formation of a peptide bond between a glycopeptide and a peptide. 4. The ability of proteases to mediate a variety of other reactions in addition to peptide bond cleavage, namely reactions involving esters and amides of carboxylic acids, renders them interesting and effective tools for resolution of pairs of enantiomers in racemic mixtures through enantioselective bond cleavage or formation. Example enzymes that have been applied for this purpose include subtilisin, A. oryzae protease, and serine alkaline protease from Thermoactinomyces vulgaris. The leucine aminopeptidase from P. putida ATCC 12633 has been cloned into E. coli K-12 and has been commercialized for production of several optically pure L-and D-amino acids using resolution strategies. Subtilisin, thermolysin, chymotrypsin, and papain have been applied in preparative synthesis of Leu-and Met-enkephalin. 5. Subtilisin was effective in the regioselective deacylation of peracylated nucleosides. Subtilisin also mediated acylation reactions of dialkyl and diallyl carbonates in the resolution of racemic amines. Subtilisin efficiently resolved racemic amine mixtures, for example, in preparation of a precursor of the synthesis of rasagiline, useful in treatment of depression and dementia as well as in synthesis of oral calcimimetic drugs.

The extracellular protease, streptokinase, produced by the hemolytic Streptococcus species, which has the ability to rapidly dissolve clots, is used to treat acute blocking of arteries, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism and is a widely used therapy for treatment of coronary thrombosis caused by myocardial infarction. A contraindication is that it also degrades other blood protein factors (including factors V and VIII and plasmin), which can result in hemorrhaging. An alternative approach being developed relates to synthesis of the human thrombolytic enzyme, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), using Chinese hamster ovary cells. This recombinant product, produced by Genentech Corporation (www.gene.com/gene/products/ information/activase/), has been approved by the FDA. 2. It has been observed that certain proteases can negatively impact certain tumor and may thus have therapeutic value. Tumor necrosis and solubilization has been observed to be induced by microinjection of solid tumors with proteases from Serratia marcescens. Use of carboxypeptidase G 1 from Pseudomonas sp. to cleave off the terminal glutamic acid from folic acid can induce a state of deficiency of folic acid, which can result in 'starvation' of certain tumor cells. The latter enzyme may also be exploited to produce a tissue-specific antiproliferative brain tumor agent, methotrexate, from a folic acid analog. 3. Botulinum toxin. Botulinum toxin (BOTOX, BoNT) is a neurotoxin produced by C. botulinum and is the causative agent of food poisoning (www.allergan.com). Over the years (1989 to date), BoNT has been approved by the FDA for various therapeutic treatments of involuntary muscle disorders and for cosmetic uses. BoNT contains a heavy and light chain and has the ability to target cholinergic nerve endings and bind with high affinity to the presynaptic motor nerve endings. The light chain consists of a zinc-dependent metalloprotease that attacks a group of proteins (the SNAREs) which mediate neurotransmitter release from the motor nerve endings. Hence, the proteolytic action of BoNT results in blocking acetylcholine release and has applications in treatment of conditions resulting from hyperactivity at cholinergic nerve endings (spasms, excessive blinking, and migraine) and in blocking pain-sensitization processes. Examples of other applications are in wound healing and in cosmetic injection procedures to prevent formation of wrinkles. The structures and modes of action of different botulinum toxins have been reviewed by Dolly and Aoki. 2 4.

In addition, in humans and animals, proteases play significant roles in a variety of microbial and viral pathophysiological conditions, including acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), staphylococcal infections, candidiasis, and malaria as well as in certain cancers, which has given momentum to the identification and development of protease inhibitors as therapeutic agents against disease-causative proteases. It appears that aspartic-, cysteine-and metalloproteases are the predominant enzymes involved in human disease conditions such that inhibitors that modulate the mechanisms of these enzymes are target therapeutic candidates. An extensive list of protease inhibitors is provided on the Science Gateway Link (http://www.sciencegateway.org/resources/protease.htm). Many microbial pathologic diseases are linked to infection of organs in one way or another exposed to the exterior environment including skin, mouth, lungs, eyes, ears, nose, other cavities, intestine, and soft tissues. Given that collagen accounts for around 30% of total mammalian protein, it is not surprising that proteases attacking collagen (collagenases) are associated with many pathological disease conditions. Microbial collagenases, involving a host of clinical organisms, have been implicated in certain mycetomas, abscesses, ulcers, septicemia, emphysemia, ecthyma gangrenosum, pregnancy complications, periodontal diseases, dental caries, and necrotizing diseases. Therefore, it is clear that inhibitors to collagenases have enormous potential in disease therapy. This is further discussed in Harrington. 4 Proteases from blood-feeding invertebrates, for example, the medical leech, Hirudo medicinalis, produce serine protease peptide inhibitors that interact with trypsin-like proteases to block blood coagulation in their hosts. 21 Proteasome inhibitors have been developed as chemotherapeutic agents with antitumor activity though induction of apoptosis. 1 Bortezomib is effective in the treatment of multiple myeloma, where increased levels of proteosomes are observed in blood serum.",

            "text": "Protease inhibitors have been developed against proteases that viruses use to cleave nascent proteins for assembly of new virions, for example, in treatment or prevention of viral infection by HIV or hepatitis C viruses. Protease inhibitors developed against HIV, saquinavir, ritonavir, and lopinavir have also exhibited antiprotozoal activity, for example, against malaria and Giardia infection (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome).Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor, omapatrilat, acts to inhibit metalloproteases including the angiotensin-converting enzyme in treatment of hypertension and in clinical management of congestive heart failure. Omapatrilat also beneficially inhibits NEP that degrades atrial natriuretic peptide, secreted by the heart.Resistance may develop to protease inhibitor treatment of viral diseases, especially when the inhibitor drug is used at suboptimal concentrations/dose rates. This is perceived as a serious problem, for example, in HIV treatment, where at least 10% of the amino acids of the HIV protease may be substituted through mutation while still retaining a viable virus 8 (http://www.aids.org).References to some of the most cited papers on classification of protease inhibitors are summarized in the BioinfoBank Library (http://lib.bioinfo.pI/meid:190879).",
