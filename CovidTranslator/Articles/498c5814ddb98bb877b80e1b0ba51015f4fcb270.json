Tourism is crucial for the economies of Spain and China, and both countries have the longest high speed rail (HSR) networks in the world. What role has HSR infrastructure played in the development of tourism in both countries? Little research has been done to date, even in Europe, to estimate empirically how tourism indicators are affected by new HSR lines. In 2012 a multivariate panel analysis by Chen and Haynes was applied to 27 Chinese regions, and confirmed that emerging high speed rail services (during the period 1999-2010) had significant positive impacts on boosting tourism in China. No similar empirical tool has ever been tested in Europe. The aim of this paper is to analyse and validate this tool when applied to the Spanish context, and to develop a comparative analysis with the Chinese case study. The methodology is applied to 47 Spanish provinces during the period 1999-2015, and the results clearly reveal a positive but lower-value link (compared to China) between the increase in certain tourism outputs (foreign arrivals and revenues) and HSR network construction. However, further research is needed into the model's limitations, namely the availability of suitable tourism indicators in the official databases, the HSR explanatory variables considered, and the ability to detect \"circular cause-effects\" between HSR and tourism.",

The transport project evaluation methodologies and public sector investment assessment in the literature review follow two main frameworks: broad CBA (Cost Benefit Analysis) and Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA). Both methodologies must consider all the economic activities that are reinforced by HSR, among other variables.",

Macharis and Bernardin (2015) reported that -after a more general category-passenger transport (such as HSR rail) and notably mobility management are the public administrations' most common types of transport project decisions handled by MCA. Within the CBA methodologies, De Rus and Nombela (2007) were the first to calculate the required minimum level of demand at which investment in HSR could be considered profitable from a social perspective. They used real costs of construction, maintenance and rolling stock for European HSR lines currently in operation, in addition to potential time savings, standard time values and predicted growth in demand. Although this approach has been generally accepted by the scientific community, the wider economic benefits of high speed are clearly hard to gauge, as they are swamped by manynot inconsiderableexternal factors such as territorial impacts. Territorial impacts may lead directly to social and economic benefits, and despite the problems of estimating and analysis, some attempts have been made to study them, especially in the case of Spain (Gutierrez, 2001; Ure\u00f1a et al., 2009; Ortega et al., 2012) .",

It also reinforces the expectations of local tourism stakeholders by improving the attractiveness of places for visitors, although no systematic patterns have been observed.

Concurrently with Chen and Haynes's first empirical works on HSR impacts on China's tourism industry, the research of Wang et al. (2012) demonstrated that the Chinese HSR system affected tourism demand by redistributing tourism centres and transforming the tourist market. However, this research methodology was not empirical so did not contribute to understanding the impact of HSR on tourism; Chen and Haynes were thus the first to address this issue in the literature.",

High-speed rail (HSR) is a relatively new mode of transportation in the contemporary transportation technology revolution, and has been promoted in various countries around the world (Albalate and Bel, 2012) . In contrast, the extensive literature on the link between air transportation and tourism (Dobruszkes and Mondou, 2013) has produced evidence of the significant effect of low-cost airlines on tourist outcomes (Rey et al., 2011) . Most of the published studies in the literature on the tourism effects of HSR describe specific HSR experiences (study cases) and some observed HSR effects on tourism, but do not point to a systemic methodology or a general conclusion (Guirao and Soler, 2008; Bazin et al., 2011) . In HSR commuting relations it is important to take account of the fact that the possibility of returning within the same day can reduce the average length of the visitors' stay. This type of HSR service is quite common in some European countries such as France and Spain (see Ure\u00f1a et al., 2009) , and may affect the interpretation of the main statistical tourism outputs (tourism revenues, number of overstays, etc.). For example, Bazin et al. (2011) studied the impact of HSR on urban and business tourism in French cities connected to Paris such as Lyon, just 2 h away from Paris by TGV (Train \u00e0 Grande Vitesse), and discovered that the daily expenditure of business tourists may be up to four times greater than that of leisure travellers. Bazin et al. (2011) pointed out that business tourism can be a key strategic orientation for cities and large urban areas, but the possibility of returning within the same day affects the average length of the tourists' stay. Guirao and Soler (2008) used a survey approach to examine the impact of tourism in Toledo on traffic from the new Madrid-Toledo line. Commuters and tourists were the main users of the line and tourism accounted for over 30% of weekday HSR ridership.",

            "text": "Apart from these isolated case studies applied to HSR, we can distinguish three types of tools that are generally used to study the impact of transportation on the tourism industry: the choice destination approach, economic geography models, and econometric models to estimate tourism demand. The choice destination approach is based on Rugg's model. Rugg (1973) was the first to introduce a time constraint, the modification of the budget due to the transportation cost between alternative destinations, and the modification of the time constraint resulting from including the time cost between alternative destinations. Assuming that tourists usually have a fixed holiday budget, Prideaux (2000) developed a model to demonstrate the dynamic relationship between holiday expenditure categories and the tourists' point of origin. The first approach to study the effects of HSR on tourist destination choice was developed by Delaplace et al. (2014) in Paris and Rome. The data collected from a survey of tourists in both cities were used for a quantitative analysis using regression models. The results showed that HSR influenced destination choice in different ways in the two cities, with tourism in Paris being more dependent on HSR. This interesting contribution was continued by Pagliara et al. (2014 Pagliara et al. ( , 2015 using Madrid as a case study, and also based on a revealed preference survey. The preliminary results showed that the Spanish HSR system appeared to have a significant effect on tourists' decision to visit other cities connected to Madrid, but the choice of Madrid as a tourist destination (as in Rome) was not influenced by the presence of HSR. Although these results are quite illustrative, the notion that destination choice may be influenced by HSR does not prove that the construction of a new line will automatically increase total tourism demand or tourist sector revenues at the destination (accommodation, restaurants, museums and so on).",

Krugman (1991) showed that a change in transport cost induces a change in the intensity of spatial competition, which in turn influences the location of firms. Masson and Petiot (2009) used Krugman's core-periphery model to explore the influence of the southern European high-speed railway line (HSR) between Perpignan (France) and Barcelona (Spain) on both tourism activity and economic development. Using Krugman's theory (through a theoretical rather than an empirical discussion), they argued that HSR can facilitate the development of tourism activities, and particularly business and urban tourism. Crampon (1966) first introduced the gravitational model into tourism research, and the only application of this approach to a HSR scenario dates from 2012: the projected effects (not validated) of Chinese HSR on tourism were examined by applying the iso-tourist line from a time-space replacement concept (Wang et al., 2012) . They forecasted the effects of the HSR network on three aspects: the redistribution and transformation of the tourist market, market competition on a larger scale, and the reallocation of the urban tourism centre. However, the results obtained by Wang et al. were not empirical, and it is therefore important to quantify the increase in tourism demand in order to assess the influence of the new infrastructure.",

The only approach of this type applied to HSR corridors was developed by Chen and Haynes (2012) . Through a multivariate panel analysis, they investigated the impact of Chinese high-speed rail systems on the tourism industry, selecting only the numbers of incoming foreign tourists and tourism revenue as the dependent variables. Chen and Haynes classified their independent variables into three groups: \"policy variables\" (all related to rail infrastructure and ridership), \"origin variables\" (related to the economic relation between foreign countries of origin and destinations) and \"destination variables\" (local site features or special events at the destination). Although the model does not consider domestic tourism (this data was not publicly available in China at the provincial level), the results of the research confirmed that policy variables have major significance in the model. The study concluded that during the period between 1999 and 2010, Chinese provinces with high-speed rail services were likely to have approximately 20% more foreign arrivals and 25% higher tourism revenues than provinces without these systems. The authors empirically demonstrated that the presence of HSR services in each province boosted tourism in China more significantly than other local variables such as the number of World Heritage Sites or museums. In 2015, a variation of this original model was developed by Chen and Haynes over the period 1997-2012, but using a panel of 21 source countries for tourism in China instead of provincial data. Other explanatory variables such as network density or number of stations were added in the equations and produced similar results, particularly for the network density variable.",

It should be noted that in most official national databases the number of foreign and domestic tourists is linked only to hotel stays (overnights), meaning that the total domestic visitors in both cases (China and Spain) has been undervalued, as there is no information on the number of tourists staying in apartments or second homes.",

It has been extended mainly towards the more populated eastern and southern cities (Barcelona, Valencia, Malaga, Seville), most of which are located in the coastal area with high tourist attractiveness. China's network is concentrated mainly in the coastal area (where all the major economic indicators are higher), with four north-south lines, two of which are fully operative (Beijing-Harbin; Beijing-Shanghai) and the rest still in only partial operation (Beijing-Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong; Hangzhou-Fuzhou-Shenzhen). These four lines cover most of the tourist destinations (Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai) or can be used as transport links to other remote destinations. There are also two east-west lines which are still only partially operated (Qingdao-Taiyuan; Shanghai-Wuhan-Chengdu).",

Although China has invested heavily in transport infrastructure in the last twenty years, Spain had more than double the density of high-capacity roads (0.030 km/km 2 ) than China (0.012 km/km 2 ) in 2015. If HSR is considered together with conventional interurban rail lines, this figure is even slightly higher (0.031 versus 0.012). This partly explains why the impact of HSR on the current transport system could be even higher in China than in Spain. Accessibility to the main tourist destinations in Spain before HSR started operation in 1992 was already guaranteed at a medium-high quality level. At the urban level, Europe has a longstanding tradition of using and operating public transport, and Spanish public transit is of significantly higher quality than its Chinese counterpart, particularly in medium and small sized cities. While transport and tourism infrastructure in Spain is balanced between inland and coastal provinces, many inland destinations in China have natural resources that could potentially represent a regional competitive advantage were they endowed with the necessary infrastructure conditions, but have had difficulty in drawing both domestic and international visitors away from the popular coastal gateways (Jackson, 2006) .",

Unlike China, data on domestic tourism demand is publicly available in Spain at the provincial level, so the tourism output variables selected in the Spanish case study were: foreign tourists, domestic tourists and revenues from foreign tourism. In Table 3 these variables are referred to as: taNR (number of non-resident tourists), taR (number of resident tourist) and tr (tourism revenue from non-resident tourists in Spain).

It was more difficult to design the origin variables. As only foreign tourism was considered in the Chinese study, the authors used the annual nominal exchange rate (exc) from the US dollar to the RMB (RenMinBi). According to statistics from INE (INE, 2016b), in 2014 more than 71% of foreign tourism in Spain came from the European Union. Our exchange variable is therefore defined as the difference between the provincial and European (Eurozone) GDP, referring to 1999 currency to avoid the effect of inflation. The origin of domestic tourism is more difficult to determine, and no origin variable related to GDP was used. Table 3 shows the rest of the independent variables (and their main descriptive statistics) added to the Spanish models. Apart from the local economic variable used in the Chinese case studythe Gross Provincial Product per capita (gpppc) -, significant efforts were made to collect the same multidimensional features of local tourism used in the original model: number of World Heritage sites (whs), starred restaurants (resta), museums (museum) and public libraries (lib). Art galleries are included in the museum database. In the Spanish case, 4-star hotels are the most popular with both domestic and foreign visitors (INE, 2016b) , so the hotel variable (hotel) included the number of 4-and 5star hotels (unlike the Chinese case study). In the time period considered (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) , no special impedance variables were taken into account, such as accidental pollution leaks or the outbreak of SARS in China. It was decided to overlook these variables as no comparable cases have occurred in Spain, and owing to the high degree of loyalty of visitors to Spain (Spanish Institute of Tourism, 2012). Instead, three special dummy variables relating to major international cultural and sporting events were introduced as attracting indicators: the Forum 2004 in Barcelona (Forum), the America's Cup in Valencia in 2007 (AmCup), and the International Exhibition in Zaragoza in 2008 (expoZ). These events have been recognised for their relevance in the research work of Renau (2010) in Spain. There is another additional variable in the model (called year), not linked to origin, destination or policy features, which groups the sequence of observations and measures time trends.",

Subindices i and t denote destination provinces and time period respectively, while Y represents the dependent variables (number of domestic tourists, number of foreign tourists and total foreign tourist revenue). A fixed effects model (FE) was developed for the unobserved individual effect in a panel model, consisting of a statistical model that represents the observed quantities in terms of explanatory variables that are treated as if the quantities were non-random. Table 4 shows the determinants of the number of foreign tourists in Spain compared with the results of Chen and Haynes (2012) . Model 1 considers rail ridership as a policy variable, while model 2 uses network length. This multivariate analysis methodology is repeated again in Table 5 to study the determinants of foreign tourism revenue in Spain (model 3 with ridership, model 4 with length). Table 6 shows the results for the output \"number of domestic tourists\" obtained from two multivariate analysis applied to the Spanish panel data, one using the independent variable rlen and the other using rider.",

These variables were not statistically significant in China in any of the models designed, while in Spain some indicators such as the hotel variable are statistically significant at the 1% level. The hotel variable coefficients in the four models range between 0.941 and 0.591. Other local site characteristics such as museums and libraries show high levels of significance, although their coefficients are much lower than for the hotel variables. These results are consistent with the Spanish offer at the destination: not only \"beach and sun\" attractions, but a greater diversification of areas such as rural and urban tourism, gastronomy, shopping, museums, health tourism, eco-tourism and others, all concentrated in the same physical location or within an easily accessible radius of influence using the transport system. Our Table 4 Determinants of the number of foreign tourists in Spain. Comparison with Chen and Haynes' results (2012 explanation is that in Spain the \"destination\" variables benefit from reinforcement and favourable complementarity, in addition to the fact that the country has a higher density of tourist destinations per km 2 compared to China. The reason the hotel coefficient is higher in Spain than in China is probably due to the convenience for tourists of being able to choose between a range of different four-and five-star hotel chains at the destination, and to the way these hotels are linked to a range of other tourist attractions. The insignificant results for the event variables are similar for the Chinese and the Spanish experience. Special events such as the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and the 2010 Shanghai Expo, and the number of pollution incidents are not statistically significant even at the 1% level. However, the dummy year of 2003 in Chinarepresenting that year's SARS epidemicis highly statistically significant. This is to be expected since SARS had a fairly strong negative effect on foreign tourist arrivals. No deterrent event variable was introduced in the Spanish model, and the results for the special events are consistent with the Chinese ones.",

In Spain, the level of significance of the variable is even higher (1%) for foreign tourism output, and the coefficients are higher, which supports the idea that visitors appreciate not only the presence of \"sun and beach\" at the destination but also the socioeconomic environment. In contrast, the gross provincial product per capita is not significant for the Spanish revenue output models, which may mean that tourist expenditure in Spain is not dependent on the price levels in the province (in richer provinces hotels and restaurants tend to be more expensive).",

In both China and Spain the positive sign of this coefficient indicates that when the price levels in the destination are lower than in the origin countries, the number of visitors increases. This coefficient was higher in the Chinese than in the Spanish case study, indicating that tourism in Spain is less sensitive to price levels. Another argument that supports this idea is that most tourists in Spain come from other EU nations (71% in 2014), and the differences in these price levels are less pronounced. The low sensitivity to price levels is reinforced by the fact that Spain tends to welcome tourists with a high degree of loyalty to the destination. In the revenue models (in both China and Spain), the exchange rate is less significant as a variable than the gross provincial product per capita (gpppc), and is unimportant in terms of significance.",

The HSR variable is statistically significant at the 1% significance level in the Chinese and Spanish revenue models (Table 5) , but only 5% significant in the demand models (number of foreign tourists) ( Table 4 ). These results are the key findings of this paper, and indicate that Spanish provinces with HSR receive more foreign tourists and more revenues than provinces without this service. Nevertheless, the HSR coefficients for Spain are much lower than for China, showing that the effect of HSR is much higher in China than in Spain. The highest coefficient in the revenue models in China is around 0.25, implying that Figures in parentheses are standard deviation. ***,**,* denote coefficients significant at the 1%, 5% and 10% statistical level respectively. provinces with HSR services were likely to have approximately 25% more tourism revenues than provinces without. In Spain, the highest coefficient (see models 3 and 4 in Table 4 ) is 0.017, indicating that provinces with HSR services were likely to have 1.7% more tourism revenues. The highest HSR coefficient in China in foreign tourism demand models (models 1 and 2, Table 4 ) is around 0.201, suggesting that provinces with HSR services were likely to have 20.1% more tourists, while this percentage is only 1.3% in Spain. These results can be explained by the fact that, as mentioned in Section 3, distances between tourist destinations are greater in China than in Spain, and the transport alternative to HSR is a lower density network (high-capacity roads and conventional trains). Accessibility to the main tourist destinations in Spain before HSR started operation in 1992 was already guaranteed at a mediumhigh quality level, and the impact of HSR on tourism indicators is thus less important.",

Neither the variable whs or museum is statistically significant, highlighting the importance of Spanish coastal destinations for this type of tourism. In support of this argument, data from the Familitur Report (ITE, 2013b) revealed that the three major destinations for domestic tourism were Andalusia, Catalonia and the Region of Valencia, accounting for almost 50% of visitor share. These three regions have a considerable extension of coastline, and the temperatures are excellent for \"sun and beach\" tourism. The only significant event variable is ExpoZaragoza in 2008, with a high significance (1%). Nevertheless, as in the foreign tourism models, the value of the coefficient (between 0.003 and 0.005) reveals its low real impact on the domestic tourist sector. The economic explanatory variable gpppc has the highest significances (lower than 1% in both rider and rlen models), and high coefficients (0.214 and 0.215 respectively). This finding underlines the considerable importance of tourism for the Spanish provincial economy and its significant and positive role for regional economic growth, as noted by previous studies (Cort\u00e9s-Jim\u00e9nes, 2008) .",

None of these commuter visitors stay in hotels, and therefore do not appear as tourists in the official statistics. In conclusion, the model would benefit from a greater level of data disaggregation and a better understanding of the territorial distribution of HSR lines through new explanatory variables relating HSR operating conditions, and including new tourism outputs based on overstays in hotels and number of visitors to the main tourism attractions, or disaggregated revenues per sector (restaurants, museums and others).",

It was declared a World Heritage site by the UNESCO in 1986 for its extensive cultural and monumental heritage, and the historical coexistence of Christian, Muslim and Jewish cultures. Before construction work started on the new line, rail traffic in the previous conventional line was not insignificant (over 800,000 passengers in 2002), and rose to over 1,300,000 passengers in this decade, as shown in Fig. 2 . The Madrid-Toledo HSR line is successful in terms of traffic, not only due to the HSR link to Madrid and its attractiveness to tourists, but also because of the type of service provided by the operating company. Since 2005, Toledo has enjoyed AVANT services with over ten daily HSR shuttles (30 min' travel time), and is also favoured by the availability of monthly tickets which are economically highly advantageous compared to ordinary one-way tickets. If the schedules are compatible with work timetables, this frequency enables their use for commuting, with the result that over 60% of users of the Madrid-Toledo HSR line have been found to be commuters.",

Bearing in mind that commuters account for 60% of HSR traffic, the increase in both the number of tourists and number of visitors to the Santo Tom\u00e9 museum is much more limited and appears to be more a result of other factors, revealing no clear evidence of the influence of HSR on these tourism variables. Fig. 2b shows the evolution of the number of resident and non-resident tourists in the province of Toledo for 2000-2013 (the period 2000-2005 is not covered at this disaggregation level by the INE's urban database of tourist points). There is no appreciable influence of HSR on residents, while a slight positive influence can be observed on non-residents. This is consistent with the results of the model applied to Spain in Section 4: foreign tourism in Spain is more positively affected by HSR than domestic tourism, although the Spanish financial crisis (which started in 2005) may have influenced this fact. The fall in all the variables since 2008, with a greater impact on the number of visitors to the Santo Tom\u00e9 museum than on the number of travellers or the number of visitors, can be explained by the Spanish financial and socioeconomic climate after 2005.",

Additionally, it is difficult to assess in the short term whether HSR contributes to improving the image of a tourist city. Apart from the Madrid-Seville line, most Spanish HSR lines have been in operation for under ten years, which is too soon to analyse or model this kind of indirect effect. Toledo was an important Spanish tourism destination before 2005, despite its lack of HSR. In any case, the improvement of the image of a tourist city in the long run will be seen in the increase in most of the tourism outputs and revenues.",

Evidently, tourism will always be an object of trip generation, but when a tourism destination already has a high rate of transport accessibility, a new mode does not add a large number of new tourists but produces a new transport modal split in the access to destination. This example shows how this cause-effect relation may be totally unbalanced towards the benefits of HSR demand. In other destinations, this fact will depend on the alternative transport modes for accessing the tourist destination and the type of tourism affected -resident or nonresident-as they clearly behave in a different way. Lastly, local strategies to promote tourism are also important. Toledo is clearly a cultural destination, but gastronomy, and rural and ecotourism have also been publicly promoted at the provincial level in recent years. HSR is only one of the possible \"gateways to the destination\", but depending on the country and the province concerned, this can either be the optimal gateway, or simply a complement to other existing ones.",

With Spain and China coming top of the rankings for the most visited tourist countries (along with France and the US) and the longest HSR networks in operation, Spain can be considered the most suitable country for validating this tool. The tourism structure in both China and Spain was studied in order to define the main differences and gain a greater understanding of the modelling results, and the following key issues were identified: tourism motivations, levels of transport accessibility to tourism destinations, weather limitations, evolution of domestic tourism and public strategies to promote tourism. The authors have made considerable efforts to adapt the Spanish database to the variables defined in the Chinese analysis, introducing new variables when necessary and eliminating any that are not applicable to the Spanish scenario. Six different models were designed using the following dependent variables: number of foreign visitors, number of domestic visitors and foreign revenue. For each dependent variable, two equations were defined (one using ridership and other railway length).",

Nevertheless, the coefficients obtained for Spain are surprisingly low compared to China, and reveal that Spanish provinces with HSR receive about 1.3% more tourists and 1.7% more revenues (20.1% and 25.0% respectively for China). These differences are explained by the greater distances between tourist destinations in China, combined with the fact that the transport alternative to HSR is a lower density network (high-capacity roads and conventional trains). Accessibility to the main tourist destinations in Spain before HSR started operation in 1992 was already guaranteed at a medium-high quality level, and HSR impact on tourism indicators is thus less important.",

The model's ability to analyse \"circular and cumulative causation\" between HSR and tourism has also been discussed as a drawback of the methodology used in this research. Although a cause-effect analysis would require a longer-term database series than available at present (over 20 years of HSR operation), this approach could be a first step towards improving the modelling. In order to clarify this issue, the authors have completed their research with a local case study (Toledo, Spain) with more disaggregated data to demonstrate how the effect of HSR on tourism indicators is ultimately less important than the impact of tourism on HSR demand.",
