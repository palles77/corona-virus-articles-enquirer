As reported previously, LiCl efficiently impairs the replication of a variety of viruses, including the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and pseudorabies herpesvirus. We demonstrate for the first time that inhibition of PPV replication in swine testis (ST) cells by LiCl is dose-dependent, and that the antiviral effect of LiCl occurred in the early phase of PPV replication. These results indicate that LiCl might be an effective anti-PPV drug to control PPV disease. Further studies are required to explore the mechanism of the antiviral effect of LiCl on PPV infection in vivo.",

The parvoviruses are small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA viruses. PPV is a major cause of reproductive failure in sows and is a significant cofactor in porcine postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome [1] [2] [3] . PPV was first isolated from pigs with fever in 1965 [4] . It is commonly found in diseased pigs and is the cause of significant economic loss for the swine industry today [1, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Currently, vaccination is the primary measure for prevention of PPV. However, the costs of vaccinations are high and might lead to biological safety issues, such as recombination and mutation of viruses. Additionally, even with vaccination, PPV is widespread in swine. Although vaccination can prevent the clinical symptoms of the PPV disease, it cannot eliminate the impairment caused by PPV disease [10, 11] . Therefore, alternative strategies, such as drug therapies to control the PPV, should receive increased attention.",

This sow came from a commercial pig farm located in Guangdong Province (Southern China). ST cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco, USA) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37\u00b0C and 5 % CO 2 .

Mocktreated ST cells served as controls. After washing with PBS, the ST cells were incubated with medium (80 ll per well) and CCK8 solution (20 ll per well) at 37\u00b0C for 1-4 h. The optical density (OD) was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, USA). The relative cell viability rate was determined for each concentration as (OD 450 drug)/(OD 450 control) 9 100. LiCl concentrations below the 50 % cytostatic concentration (CC 50 ) were defined as non-toxic concentrations [19] .",

At this concentration, no differences in cell morphology were found between LiCl-treated ST cells and mock-treated ST cells (data not shown). To investigate which phase of PPV replication was sensitive to LiCl treatment, ST cells were exposed to LiCl at several points in the viral life cycle.

Relative cell viability was determined by CCK8 assay and normalized to the value of the 0 mM group (set at 100 %). Data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 S.D. of three independent experiments 23]. Based on these properties, this study was designed to determine whether LiCl inhibits PPV attachment and entry. Effect on replication of PPV Viral replication assays were performed to evaluate the effect of LiCl on the replication of PPV in ST cells. The mean viral titers of mock-treated ST cells and cells treated with 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mM LiCl were 5.83, 4.62, 3.58, 3.18, 2.41, and 2.09, respectively; the PPV titers decreased in a dose-dependent manner in ST cells treated with LiCl (Fig. 2C). To confirm the inhibitory effect of LiCl, a real-time PCR targeting the NS1 gene of PPV and an IFA for detection of the PPV protein load were performed. For the real-time PCR, the mean relative mRNA load of mock-treated ST cells and ST cells treated with 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mM LiCl were 100, 75, 20, 3.33, 3.67, and 4.0 (with mock-treated cells set at 100), respectively (Fig. 2D). For the IFA, none of the drug-treated ST cells generated strong fluorescent signals 48 h after infection. The fluorescent signals declined when cells were treated with 15 mM or 30 mM LiCl. No fluorescent signals were detected for the mock-treated cells (no PPV and no drug; Fig. 3). Inhibitory effect on PPV replication at early stages To determine which stage of PPV replication was affected by LiCl, the time course of PPV replication was examined after addition of the drug. After the PPVs entered the ST cells, cells were treated with 30 mM LiCl at different times postinfection. The viral titers were determined after the ST cells had grown for 24 h. In contrast to the control, the replication of the virus was significantly reduced after addition of the drug at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 h postinfection, but no further significant reductions occurred at 14, 18, and 24 h postinfection",
