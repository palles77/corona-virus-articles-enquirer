During the study period, 22 patients had 25 episodes of proven HRV pneumonia. Fever (60%), cough (92%), sputum production (61%), and dyspnea (60%) were common symptoms. Fifteen (60%) episodes demonstrated bacterial (n=n=7), fungal (n=n=5), or viral (n=n=3) co-infection. Among the remaining 10 (40%) cases of HRV monoinfection, patients' oxygen saturations ranged from 80% to 97% on ambient air, and computed tomography scans showed peribronchiolar, patchy, ground glass infiltrates.",

In healthy volunteers inoculated with HRV by intranasal aerosol insufflations, HRV is detected in bronchial biopsy specimens by in situ hybridization (2) . HRVs are now recognized to have a major impact on asthma pathogenesis, including asthma development and exacerbations (3) (4) (5) . Studies of hospitalized pediatric and adult patients demonstrate that HRV infection is associated with bronchiolitis and pneumonia (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Furthermore, among elderly nursing home residents, HRVs have been implicated in outbreaks of severe acute respiratory illness leading to hospitalization and even death (11, 12) .",

In a retrospective study of HSCT recipients with acute pulmonary infiltrates, HRVs were detected in 8 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid specimens from 6 patients, representing 6% of all BALs performed in HSCT recipients during the study period (15) . In order to understand further the role of HRVs in LRTI in HSCT recipients, we conducted a review of all HRV infections in our institution's HSCT population since the implementation of molecular detection methods beginning in 2008.",

Beginning in March 2008, our laboratory implemented reference molecular testing for respiratory viruses by the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada) conducted by ViraCor Laboratories (Lee's Summit, Missouri, USA). The RVP assay comprises a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by a multiplex target-specific primer extension step (16, 17) . The RVP assay detects 10 respiratory viruses (human metapneumovirus, influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza viruses [PIV] 1-3, respiratory syncytial viruses [RSV] A and B, adenovirus, and HRV) and 2 additional subtypes (influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2). In addition to the RVP assay, all BAL specimens from HSCT recipients with suspected pneumonia are evaluated by the following microbiologic studies: bacterial Gram stain and culture, fungal Calcofluor potassium hydroxide stain and culture, acid-fast bacillus stain and culture, Legionella culture, Pneumocystis jirovecii direct fluorescentantibody testing, and respiratory virus culture including cytomegalovirus, influenza, PIV, RSV, and adenovirus.",

Notably, in multivariate analyses, the presence of 1 or more additional respiratory pathogens remained independently associated with pneumonia. Furthermore, among all 25 episodes of proven HRV pneumonia, 60% demonstrated bacterial, fungal, or viral coinfection. These findings are consistent with previous reports of HSCT recipients with pneumonia and HRV detection in BAL fluid that have also identified bacterial or fungal coinfection in the majority of cases (15, 20) . Among immunocompetent adults and children, HRVs have been detected in up to 17% of episodes of community-acquired pneumonia using PCR (21, 22) , often with concomitant bacterial infection. Several potential mechanisms through which HRV increases susceptibility to bacterial infection have been demonstrated in vitro. For example, HRVs stimulate Streptococcus pneumoniae adhesion to human tracheal epithelial cells via increases in platelet-activating factor-receptors (23), promote S. aureus internalization into non-fully permissive cultured pneumocytes (24) , and disrupt epithelial cell barrier function by dissociation of zona-occludens 1 from the tight junction complex, thereby facilitating transmigration of bacteria (25) . Therefore, HRVs may be similar to influenza in predisposing to bacterial superinfection. Other mechanisms by which influenza increases susceptibility to bacterial infection, including airway epithelial damage, surface receptor changes, and altered neutrophil function, warrant further study in models of HRV infection. ). This is notable because all patients were tested for a panel of 10 respiratory viruses using multiplex PCR during each HRV infection, and therefore, the likelihood of missed cases of viral coinfection was low. Our findings are consistent with those of Greer et al. (26) who showed a statistically significant reduction in viral co-detection compared to other respiratory viruses, perhaps because of mediation of interferon-stimulating genes, thus inducing a protective antiviral state.",

            "text": "Our study also identified 10 cases of pneumonia in which HRV was the sole pathogen identified in BAL fluid. To date, little research has been performed on the pathogenesis of HRV pneumonia. However, studies focused on the mechanism of HRV-induced exacerbations of chronic lung disease, including asthma (27) (28) (29) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (30) (31) (32) , may provide insight into the pathophysiology of HRV pneumonia. For example, in patients with asthma, impaired innate and adaptive immune responses, including deficient interferon production (29, 33) and augmented Th2 or impaired Th1 or IL10 immunity (27) , have been implicated in increased bronchial inflammation and hyperreactivity. Through a similar mechanism identified in patients with asthma and COPD, HRV may potentially cause parenchymal destruction through direct cell injury as well as altered immune responses in immunocompromised hosts.",

These findings included a striking necrotizing bronchitis including ciliocytophthoria of bronchial epithelial cells (34) and an effaced nuclear chromatin amidst bronchial epithelial cells, although without unequivocal intranuclear and or cytoplasmic inclusions. Similar nuclear changes were not seen within the alveolar pneumocytes. In the few reported cases of HRV LRTI with human histology, HRV is capable of causing both interstitial and alveolar processes. In these reports, pathologic findings included bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (14) , interstitial pneumonitis (20) , acute and chronic inflammation with fibrinopurulent alveolar debris (35) , and hyperplasia and desquamation of alveolar cells (36) . These findings collectively contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of pulmonary HRV infection.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, as our data are observational and rely on clinical specimens, some patients with HRV-associated acute respiratory illness may have been missed if they were not tested for HRV. Missed cases of HRV-associated acute respiratory illness would be more likely to occur with mild URI than pneumonia, because most HSCT recipients with pneumonia are hospitalized and undergo thorough microbiologic evaluation. Therefore, we cannot infer the relative frequency with which HRV causes pneumonia compared to URI in the HSCT population. Concern may be raised that HRV detection in the lower airways reflects colonization rather than infection. However, the same argument could be made for other respiratory viruses, such as influenza A, PIV 3 and RSV, which are known to cause both URI and LRTI. Several studies have demonstrated HRV replication in primary human airway epithelial cells (37, 38) . Moreover, the ability of HRVs to replicate in bronchial epithelium after experimental upper airway infection of healthy human volunteers has been demonstrated using in situ hybridization (2) . Another limitation is that molecular testing was not routinely performed for certain viral (coronavirus, PIV4, and human bocavirus) and atypical pathogens (Chlamydophila pneumonia and Mycoplasma pneumonia) during the study period, potentially missing additional cases of HRV co-infection.",

This conclusion is also consistent with 2 recent studies in which 100% of clinical specimens (n=164) positive for HRV/HEV by RVP were subsequently confirmed positive for HRV and negative for HEV upon further molecular testing (39, 40) .",

Knowledge that certain strains and species of HRV are associated with severe respiratory infection in patients with hematologic malignancy may aid in risk stratification of patients with HRV URI before transplantation and improve infection control practices in hospitalized patients. A study of the molecular epidemiology of HRV infection in patients with hematologic malignancy and HSCT recipients is ongoing at our institution.
