In particular, seasonal variations in demographic processes may considerably affect the persistence of a pathogen in these populations. Furthermore, it has been long observed in computer simulations that under seasonal perturbations, a host-pathogen system can exhibit complex dynamics, including the transition to chaos, as the magnitude of the seasonal perturbation increases. In this paper, we develop a seasonally perturbed Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model of avian influenza in a seabird colony. Numerical simulations of the model give rise to chaotic recurrent epidemics for parameters that reflect the ecology of avian influenza in a seabird population, thereby providing a case study for chaos in a hostpathogen system. We give a computer-assisted exposition of the existence of chaos in the model using methods that are based on the concept of topological hyperbolicity. Our approach elucidates the geometry of the chaos in the phase space of the model, thereby offering a mechanism for the persistence of the infection. Finally, the methods described in this paper may be immediately extended to other infections and hosts, including humans.",

The recent emergence of a wide range of diseases in colonial bird populations is a cause for concern among conservation biologists (Chen et al. 2005; O'Brien et al. 2011; Sovada et al. 2008) . Most seabird species form large colonies that may contain thousands, and sometimes, millions of birds (Croxall 1987 ) on inaccessible mainland cliffs and offshore islands. Nests are often in close proximity to each other. Seabird colonies seemingly provide ideal conditions for the transmission and persistence of pathogens. Major outbreaks of avian cholera and avian pox have occurred in seabird populations (Descamps et al. 2009; \u00d6sterblom et al. 2004; Rolland et al. 2009; Young and VanderWerf 2008) . Puffinosis is enzootic among manx shearwaters (Puffinus puffinus) on isolated colonies off the coast of Wales (Dane et al. 1953; Nuttall and Harrap 1982) . However, the mechanisms behind the persistence of that virus remain unclear. On the other hand, epidemics involving mass mortalities of seabirds are rarely reported (Descamps et al. 2009; Muzaffar and Jones 2004; Waller and Underhill 2007) . There is little information available on the impacts of diseases on seabird populations because seabirds are difficult to monitor continuously, especially during winter (Bogdanova et al. 2011) . Therefore, there is a need to gain a deeper understanding of how pathogens might persist in seabird populations, especially when emerging infectious diseases continue to pose a major threat to humankind and wildlife (Daszak et al. 2000; Jones et al. 2008) .",

            "text": "In this paper, we investigate the long-term impacts of the introduction of a directly transmitted microparasite, highly pathogenic H5NI avian influenza virus, to a seabird population. Highly pathogenic H5NI avian influenza virus is one of a number of zoonotic emerging infectious diseases that is a cause for serious concern for the world's public health systems. The occurrence of mass mortality events in wild bird hosts (Chen et al. 2005 ) has led to the hypothesis that migratory birds may transport the H5N1 virus between countries (Kilpatrick et al. 2006; Peterson et al. 2007) . Furthermore, there are fears that areas where various species of aquatic birds congregate, e.g., Delaware Bay in the US, are \"hotspots\" for the evolution of avian influenza viruses, which may lead to the appearance of another novel pandemic strain (Krauss et al. 2010) . Clearly, the introduction of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza to a seabird population with no pre-existing herd immunity would be of grave concern to public health specialists, as well as marine conservationists. In particular, we examine how the seasonality of seabird breeding behavior impacts upon the long-term persistence of pathogens such as avian influenza. Marine birds at higher latitudes generally abandon the breeding site during the non-breeding season, unlike non-migratory land birds that may remain in the general area of the territory for most, if not all, of the year (Hamer et al. 2001) . For example, the common guillemot Uria aalge returns to its breeding colonies in the British Isles in March, with eggs generally being laid in April and May (Nettleship and Birkhead 1985) . Most guillemots will have departed from the breeding colonies by the end of August (BWP 2007) . Likewise, the northern gannet lays its eggs in April but the young may be found at the colony into late September (Nelson 1978) .",

            "text": "In this paper, we develop a seasonally perturbed Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model of avian influenza in a seabird colony. We perturb the rate of recruitment of infectives in our model. We show that the model exhibits chaotic behavior for very small amplitude of the recruitment of infectives to the population. Furthermore, we provide a careful description of the chaotic behavior using the tools of topological hyperbolicity, which were developed in Pokrovskii (1997) and are discussed in detail in Sect. 5 of this paper. The topological hyperbolicity method can be applied to prove chaos in the Smale sense, see Guckenheimer and Holmes (1983) or Wiggins (2003) for an introduction to Smale-type chaos. Computer-assisted applications of the method were used to prove the existence of chaotic trajectories for the extended Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers wave equations (Cox et al. 2005) , for the Kaldor model of the trade cycle with a hysteretic nonlinearity (McNamara and Pokrovskii 2006) and for a piecewise linear oscillator (Pokrovskii et al. 2007) . A proof of the existence of chaos in a singularly perturbed system using the method, which was not computer-aided, was provided by Pokrovskii and Zhezherun (2008) . While it is well known that seasonally perturbed population-pathogen systems can exhibit a variety of dynamics, including chaotic behaviour (Aron and Schwartz 1984; Dushoff et al. 2004; Earn et al. 2000; Keeling et al. 2001; Olsen and Schaffer 1990) , it is a highly non-trivial task to provide a proof of the existence of chaos in such a system. The goal of this paper is to illustrate the topological hyperbolicity theory, which provides a careful computer-assisted analysis of chaos in the seabird-pathogen system. The method identifies a series of sets in the phase space in which there is chaotic behaviour. Our approach illustrates the geometry of chaos in the phase space of the seabird-pathogen system for parameter values that are relevant for H5N1 avian influenza in a seabird colony. Our approach also provides insight into the conditions under which a pathogen will persist in a population of long-lived colonial seabirds that congregate to breed on an annual basis.",

We assume that the population is constant, i.e., S + I + R = N . We assume frequency-dependent bilinear (or mass-action) transmission in which the number of contacts between the susceptibles and the infectives is independent of the population size. The infection is transmitted through direct contact between the susceptible and the infected birds at a rate\u03b2 I S/N , where\u03b2 is the contact rate per infectious individual. For convenience we set \u03b2 =\u03b2/N . After an instance of infection, the infected bird immediately becomes infectious; that is, the model disregards a latent period. This is a reasonable assumption because the latent period of avian influenza is about 2 days (Gani et al. 2005; Tiensin et al. 2007 ). The infected birds recover and become immune to the disease at a rate \u03b3 I . The size of a colony N is limited only by the availability of the breeding spots, and the number of these are constant. When a guillemot chick is born, it remains in the colony for about 22 days before leaving (Nettleship and Birkhead 1985) . The chicks that departed subsequently return to the colony as adults after 4-5 years to breed (Crespin et al. 2006) . We assume that all these birds return as susceptible adults. Space is scarce, and vacant nesting spots are immediately occupied by a candidate. Therefore, for a seabird colony the recruitment exactly balances the mortality, disregarding whether it is inflicted by the disease (at a rate \u03c9 I I ) or by natural causes (at a rate \u03c9I ). Under these assumptions, we arrive at the following system of differential equations:",

The resulting two-dimensional system is equivalent for SIR and SIRS models, including those models with vertical transmission. Furthermore, system (2) always has an infection-free equilibrium state that is conveniently located in the origin. In addition, it is readily seen that the positive quadrant is a positive invariant set of this system, and hence any phase trajectory initiated in this quadrant indefinitely remains there. Finally, when the system parameters are constant, this system is globally asymptotically stable (O'Regan et al. 2010) . That means that this system always has a globally attractive equilibrium state. Depending on the basic reproduction number R 0 = \u03b2 N /\u03b3 , this equilibrium state is either positive (endemic), or infection-free. Seasonality may be introduced into an autonomous SIR model by incorporating a periodical forcing term into the system. The most common approach of introducing seasonality to epidemic models is periodically perturbing the transmission constant \u03b2 (Altizer et al. 2006; Aron and Schwartz 1984; Bolker and Grenfell 1993; Keeling et al. 2001; Olsen and Schaffer 1990; Stone et al. 2007 ). However, the seasonality in a seabird colony is mostly associated with the seasonal breeding pattern of the birds, i.e., with seasonally-varying recruitment rate. Therefore, it makes sense to perturb the recruitment rate p in system (2).",

We plotted bifurcation diagrams using Mathematica 7.0. Figure 1 shows the bifurcation diagram for system (3) for R 0 = 10. For equally spaced values of p 1 , we solved the seasonally perturbed SIR model (3) with the initial condition (I (0), R(0)) = (1, 0) to determine the long-term solution. For each value of the bifurcation parameter p 1 , 900 transient years were discarded before the maximum value of the infected population was recorded each year for 100 years. A single point corresponding to p 1 represents a 1-year cycle of epidemics, two points corresponding to p 1 describe a 2-year cycle, etc. Figure 1 shows the transition from one-periodic behaviour to complicated dynamics as p 1 is increased from 0.0185 to 0.025. The period-doubling route to chaos has been observed in seasonal SEIR models, e.g., Aron and Schwartz (1984) . For each value of p 1 , we observe stable trajectories that oscillate with period T in the long-term, which may have n local maxima in an arbitrary time period \u03c4 to \u03c4 + T years. The number of epidemics n, or local maxima, need not equal the period T of a trajectory. The n local maxima have different values and repeat every T years. We plot the maximum value of the set of local maxima of the trajectory in each year for 100 years. Therefore, for a T -periodic trajectory, we observe T points, corresponding to those maximum values, for each value of p 1 in Fig. 1 .",

The map is iterated from a given initial condition, the infected and recovered populations at the end of 1 year are recorded and then the iteration is repeated, starting from this point. We denote by \u03a6 the time-one translation operator along trajectories of the seasonally perturbed system with the parameters given in Table 1 . We have chosen the amplitude of the perturbation p 1 to be 0.025, which is well within the chaotic region shown in Fig. 1 .

It is noteworthy that the numerically observed attractor closely resembles the famous strange attractor of the H\u00e9non map (H\u00e9non 1976) , shown in Fig. 2b for comparison. The chaotic attractor of the H\u00e9non map is a typical example of a quasiattractor, i.e., it encloses non-robust singular trajectories (Anishchenko et al. 1998) . Therefore, perturbations of the parameters giving rise to such attractors can result in the disappearance of the attractor and the appearance of stable periodic trajectories. The quasiattractor consists of a map of Smale's horseshoe type and a denumerable set of stable periodic orbits with very narrow basins of attraction. The non-transversal intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds of unstable fixed points of the mapping is a typical signature of a quasiattractor. In contrast to Fig. 2b , the top left-hand corner of Fig. 2a has a vertical line of points close to the I (n) = 0 axis. Figure 3a shows on closer inspection, that the line has fractal structure and is a miniature version of Fig. 2a . Upon closer examination of the curve in the bottom left-hand corner of Fig. 2a , a similar horseshoe-like structure is apparent (Fig. 3b ). Such structures are associated with the unstable manifolds of saddle cycles, which are in turn associated with the \"dangerous\" trajectories that can lead to the appearance of stable periodic windows. In the neighbourhood of such trajectories of the H\u00e9non map for the parameters that give rise to the chaotic attractor shown in Fig. 2b , there is a map of Smale's horseshoe type (Anishchenko et al. 1998) . Finally, it is also clear from these figures that the infected population persists, albeit at very low levels.",

Generally proofs of chaos involve establishing a correspondence between the dynamical system and the appropriate symbolic dynamics.

Computer-assisted proofs of chaotic dynamics of the H\u00e9non map and R\u00f6ssler equations have been achieved using the Kronecker index (Zgliczynski 1997) . The Conley index has also been used to establish the existence of chaos in various systems, e.g., see Mischaikow and Mrozek (1998), Mischaikow (2002) , Day et al. (2004) , Gameiro et al.

The topological hyperbolicity method can be applied to prove chaos in the Smale sense, i.e., to show the existence of a correspondence between the left shift mapping on the set of symbolic sequences and a restriction of some fixed iterate of the translation operator of the dynamical system under consideration to an invariant set. The method has been applied to prove the existence of chaotic trajectories for a wide variety of strongly nonlinear systems (Cox et al. 2005; McNamara and Pokrovskii 2006; Pokrovskii et al. 2007; Pokrovskii and Zhezherun 2008) .

A formal treatment of the subject is Fig. 4 A topologically hyperbolic parallelogram P and its image F(P). A topologically hyperbolic parallelogram always contains a fixed point of the mapping F. The red boundaries of P are mapped to the red boundaries of F(P) and similarly the blue boundaries are mapped to the blue boundaries of F(P). The mapping F \"expands\" along the unstable direction (parallel to the red boundary of P) and \"contracts\" along the stable direction, which is parallel to the blue boundary of P (color figure online) given by Pokrovskii (1997) . Informally, a parallelogram P is said to be topologically hyperbolic if the image of P under a continuous mapping F, F(P), intersects P in such a way that they form a distorted \"cross-shape\" with one another (Fig. 4 ). Note that a \"stretching\" behaviour is observed in one direction (the unstable direction) and a \"compression\" is observed in the other (stable) direction. If P and its image, F(P) intersect in this manner, then, from the two-dimensional version of topological degree theory (Krasnosel'skii and Zabreiko 1984), there exists a fixed point of the mapping F in the intersection of P and F(P). A fixed point exists because the principle of non-zero rotation (Krasnosel'skii and Zabreiko, 1984, Theorem 4.2, pp 9) is satisfied, i.e., the rotation of the vector field I\u2212 F at the boundary of P is non-zero, where I is the identity map. Informally, the rotation is the number of full turns of the vector x \u2212 F as x runs through the boundary of P anti-clockwise (Krasnosel'skii and Zabreiko 1984) . A formal definition of the rotation will be stated in Sect. 5.2.",

Figure 5 shows three such parallelograms, P 1 , P 2 and P 3 , and their images under the mapping F. In this figure, the image of P 1 , F(P 1 ), crosses P 2 , F(P 2 ) crosses P 3 , and F(P 3 ) crosses P 1 . Then the product theorem for rotations, (Krasnosel'skii and Zabreiko, 1984, Theorem 7.2, pp 18) guarantees that there exists a periodic trajectory with minimal period, in this case, with period three, whose elements belong to the corresponding intersections. The product theorem states that the rotation of the composition of mappings with respect to the boundary of P is well defined, i.e., it offers a formula for the rotation of the composition of mappings in terms of the rotations of those mappings. We can see this if we consider the mapping G = F 3 . By the principle of non-zero rotation, there is a fixed point of the mapping G but the product theorem guarantees existence of a fixed point with minimal period three. The assertion is true for a chain of parallelograms of arbitrary length m > 1.",

Applying the product theorem once more, we can guarantee that there exist A topologically hyperbolic chain of three parallelograms. Note that the set F(P 1 ) intersects P 1 in a \"cross\" shape, in addition to intersecting P 2 . Therefore, there exist periodic orbits with any given minimal periods that are greater than or equal to three. This is an example of a nine-periodic orbit periodic orbits with any given period that are greater than, or equal to three. This is because if F(P 1 ) crosses P 1 in the desired manner, then by the principle of non-zero rotation, there exists a fixed point of the mapping F in P 1 . This fact, together with the existence of a periodic trajectory with minimal period three, allows arbitrarily many period-one orbits to be \"appended\" to period-three orbits. For example, in Fig. 6 , there exists a nine-periodic orbit whose elements belong to the intersections of the parallelograms and their images. The orbit is close to the union of two period-three orbits and three period-one orbits. The assertion is true for a chain of parallelograms of arbitrary length m > 1.",

Definition 6 describes rigorously the important attributes of chaotic behavior of a mapping f : R d \u2192 R d . These attributes are sensitive dependence on initial conditions, which means that any two trajectories that begin from arbitrarily close initial conditions will diverge from one another as time t increases. Other characteristics of chaos are an abundance of unstable periodic trajectories of arbitrary period and an irregular mixing effect, i.e., the existence of a finite number of separated subsets U 1 , . . . , U n that can be visited by trajectories of some fixed iterate f k of f in any prescribed order. The definition resembles the statement of the Smale homoclinic theorem (Ruelle 1989 ) except that we do not require the existence of an invariant Cantor set. Instead, the definition includes property (p2), which is usually a corollary of uniqueness of the trajectory, and (p3), which is a form of sensitivity and irregular mixing that is similar to that in the Li-Yorke definition of chaos (Li and Yorke 1975) , with the subset S(\u03b7) corresponding to the Li-Yorke scrambled subset S 0 .

Pokrovskii and Rasskazov (2004) developed the broken orbits method to find the fixed point. We found the fixed point by calculating the rotation number along the boundary of a small enough rectangle. As a consequence of the stiffness of system (3) (its stiffness results from parameter values that have very different magnitudes, see Table 1 ), calculating the rotation number in this manner may not be precise enough for identifying a suitable pseudo-periodic point close to the fixed point of \u03a6. Instead, we used an alternative procedure: a small rectangle around the fixed point was identified, the iterated mapping \u03a6 m was then defined and a routine was used to search for a suitable pseudo-periodic point",

The dynamics of the mapping \u03a6 26 on the set S are similar to those exhibited by the Smale horseshoe map (see Guckenheimer and Holmes (1983) for an extensive discussion of the Smale horseshoe). Most orbits will escape from S but some will remain forever in it. The points in the orbits that remain in S will visit the nine sets U i \u2208 U in any order; the order of visitation is determined by sequences in \u03c9 R (9). Figure 10 shows the family of sets U ; we now have an understanding of the geometry of the chaos that system (3) exhibits for realistic biological parameter values. It is useful to know that the vertical line near I (n) = 0 in Fig. 15a may be visited by chaotic trajectories (Fig. 15b, c) . While the relevance of \u03a6 26 being chaotic may not be of immediate ecological interest, it is important to note that the seabird species we considered in this paper are long-lived and return to the same colony year after year to breed. Moreover, the species we have considered tend to be philopatric and consequently, colonies remain occupied for generations and are rarely abandoned. Therefore, chaotic behaviour on a long time scale may be relevant in such a scenario.",

Our analysis of the seasonally perturbed SIR model (3) for the parameters in Table 1 confirms that seasonality alone may significantly drive the dynamics of an endemic microparasitic infection in a seabird population. Seasonal perturbation of the recruitment rate of infectious individuals p, which varies as a result of the seasonal congregation of seabirds at their breeding sites, can result in recurrent epidemics. The bifurcation diagrams suggest that changes in the pattern of outbreaks are driven by the degree of seasonal variation of p. We observe subharmonic resonance, i.e., cycles with periods that are an integer multiple of the seasonal perturbation (Fig. 1) . It is noteworthy that subharmonic resonance may occur in the seasonally perturbed SIR model (3) for parameters that reflect the ecology of avian influenza in a seabird colony. Indeed, seasonal forcing of small magnitude can lead to chaos, thereby allowing epidemics of unpredictable magnitude and duration to occur. Our approach has elucidated the geometry of the chaotic behaviour in the phase space of system (3). Furthermore, it is important to note that recurrent and highly seasonal outbreaks of disease have occurred in some isolated seabird populations, e.g., regular outbreaks of puffinosis have occurred among manx shearwater fledglings on islands off the coast of Wales since 1908 (Dane et al. 1953; Nuttall and Harrap 1982) . The results of our study indicate a potential mechanism for the persistence of such a pathogen.",

Furthermore, the pathogenic taxa that are present on seabird colonies do not necessarily lead to mass, or at least obvious, mortalities (Mallory et al. 2010; Muzaffar and Jones 2004 ). An infection may not necessarily be \"patent\" (Clayton and Moore 1997), i.e., an individual may not exhibit obvious symptoms of infection such as disease or shedding of pathogenic particles. An epidemic is defined as \"a sudden or rapid increase in the prevalence of a parasite or a disease\" (Anderson and May 1982).

            "text": "Our model has neglected some important potential transmission pathways such as environmental transmission and cross-species transmission. A multitude of parasitic and pathogenic taxa can be found on seabird colonies (see Muzaffar and Jones 2004; Barbosa and Palacios 2009 and the references therein). Some of these may persist over multiple breeding seasons (Nuttall 1984) and avian influenza viruses can persist in the environment for many months (Rohani et al. 2009 ). Interactions between multiple hosts and parasites can influence cross-species transmission of infectious diseases, from domestic hosts to wildlife and vice versa (Daszak et al. 2000) . Inter-species transmission may also be interesting to investigate as colonies often consist of more than one species nesting in close proximity to each other (Hamer et al. 2001) . For example, eleven species of seabird live on Great Saltee Island off the coast of Ireland (Nuttall et al. 1984) . The presence of multiple hosts may increase or decrease the risk of outbreaks and may enhance, or prevent, the persistence of pathogens if they become established, under different conditions (Dobson 2004) . In some wildlife diseases, one species may act as an efficient reservoir of infection that continuously sustains the incidence of disease in another species (Daszak et al. 2000; Keesing et al. 2006 ). In addition, vectors that live on seabird colonies, such as ticks, harbour microparasites and may also act as reservoirs of disease (Muzaffar and Jones 2004; Nuttall 1984) . Finally, an isolated marine bird population in a temperate climate has important characteristics, e.g., low recruitment rate, that may lead to extinction, or \"fadeout\", of an introduced pathogen (Swinton et al. 2002) . A stochastic model would be required to study the probability of fadeout of disease in seabird colonies and to establish the \"critical community size\", i.e., the population above which an infection will persist among members of a population (Earn et al. 1998; Swinton et al. 2002) .",

The introduction of pathogens to isolated seabird populations does not appear to induce such complicated dynamics of the infected population, or if they do, they are not detected. Therefore, it is clear that more theoretical and experimental work needs to be done to clarify the conditions that lead to recurrent epidemics in isolated seabird populations. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that chaotic behaviour can occur close to the I = 0 axis, the disease-free boundary of the phase space of system (3). If chaotic trajectories can occur in that region, demographic stochasticity may lead to extinction of the infected population.",

For example, positive Lyapunov exponents indicate sensitivity to initial conditions but do not show that periodic trajectories of any given period exist or if irregular mixing effects occur. We have gone further than the aforementioned studies because we have identified a sequence of parallelograms within the numerically observed attractor in which there is an invariant set with dynamics that are semiconjugate to those of the left shift on nine symbols. Moreover, we constructed the sequence of topologically hyperbolic mappings using numerical values that reflect the ecology of avian influenza in a seabird colony. The sequence of parallelograms elucidate the geometry of chaos in the phase space of system (3) for these parameters. Finally, the invariant set we constructed is embedded within the quasiattractor. To our knowledge, an identification of such a set in the phase space of a seasonally forced epidemiological model has not previously been achieved. Rand and Wilson (1991) constructed a \"chaotic repellor\" for a seasonally forced SEIR model parameterised for chickenpox. Chaotic repellors are associated with long chaotic transients (Tel et al. 2008 ). However, the set they constructed was not embedded within a chaotic attractor.",

However, they obtained local and global error estimates for the fourth order Runge-Kutta numerical integration method. We used the Mathematica 7.0 differential equation solver to evaluate the translation operator numerically. This solver has the ability to switch between different numerical integration methods, depending on the stiffness of the system. Therefore, while local error estimates of the Mathematica numerical integration scheme are relatively easy to obtain (Wolfram Research 2011), global estimates are very difficult to find (M. Quinlan personal communication).",

The advantage of the method is that it allows one to visualise the geometry of the chaos that a system exhibits in the phase space. The technique involves the construction of the translation operator, which in this case was the time-one map corresponding to the seasonally perturbed SIR model. The topological hyperbolicity method has been applied to other highly nonlinear systems through Poincar\u00e9 maps (Pokrovskii et al. 2007; Rasskazov 2003) and through mappings with strong nonlinearities (McNamara and Pokrovskii 2006) .
