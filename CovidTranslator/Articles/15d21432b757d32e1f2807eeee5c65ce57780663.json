The authors introduce a method for simultaneous imaging, detection and quantitative evaluation of multiple viruses in single cells by using multicolor quantum dot (QD) probes and in a single staining cycle. The multicolor QD probes were fabricated via interaction between QDs conjugated to Staph. aureus protein A (SpA-QDs) and virus-specific antibodies. A cocktail of differently colored QD-SpA-MAbs probes were loaded into the same cells containing multiple viruses, and this enabled the different viruses to be fluorescently imaged and analyzed simultaneously. Specifically, influenza A viruses of type H1N1, H3N2, and H9N2, as well as human adenovirus species B type 3 (HAdV-B3) were imaged and detected in virus-infected cells or in their co-infected cells. In our perception, the method provides a flexible platform for simultaneous detection of multiple viruses in co-infected cells. Hence, it offers new opportunities for the molecular diagnosis of virus coinfection and for studies on virus-cell interactions.",

            "text": "Virus coinfection is frequently observed in clinical settings [1, 2] . The simultaneous detection and quantitative evaluation of the coinfection of a cell by multiple viruses or even multiple subtypes is urgently in demand, yet it remains difficult. Several laboratory methods are available for detecting viruses, but they have disadvantages for the simultaneous detection and quantitative evaluation of multiple viruses in a single cell. Currently available multiplex PCR methods have been widely used for the detection of multiple viruses [3] . However, they require a marker of a professional primer and carefully designed probes to avoid cross-and mis-hybridization [4] . More importantly, with PCR-based methods as well as some other methods, including gene chips, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and biomolecular mass spectrometry, it is difficult to provide the subcellular localization information and single-cell analysis results for the different co-infecting viruses [1, 5] . The direct isolation and culture of viruses in cell lines is a convincing method and the gold standard, but it requires skilled technologists and specialized laboratory settings as well as a long turnaround time [6] . In addition, many viruses cannot be covered by culture. Immunofluorescence (IF) by labelling antibodies with fluorophores is available for virus detection in single cells. However, such probes have been limited to the qualitative evaluation of 2-3 colours in most cases and relatively low sensitivity due to the unfavourable optical properties of organic dyes [7] . Alternatively, in comparison with organic dyes, quantum dots (QDs) have good optical properties; including sizetuneable light emission, improved signal brightness, resistance against photobleaching and the simultaneous excitation of multiple fluorescence colours [8] . Compared to other fluorescent nanoparticles such as carbon dots or upconversion nanoparticles, QDs have higher photo-quantum efficiency and more colours. Based on these good optical properties, QD-based methods have been built for biomolecular and virus detection. In particular, comprehensive molecular profiling of individual cells has been achieved by using QDs [9] .",

This bio-conjugation is most commonly based on cross-linking reactions between amine and carboxylic acid groups (catalysed by carbodiimide) [12] . Then, the QD-SpA conjugates captured free MAbs in the solution via self-assembly, with SpA acting as an adaptor for the orientation-controlled IgG immobilization via binding to the Fc region of IgG (step 2). When the molar ratio of SpA to IgG is relatively high, all the MAbs will be conjugated with the QD-SpA, and after the formation of the QD-SpA-MAb complex, there are no sterically accessible binding sites left on the MAb, which prevents cross-linking of different QDs via MAbs [13, 14] . This ensured that the QD-SpA-MAb probe preparation did not require a probe purification process [15] . The formation of different functional QD-SpA-MAb probes either are pooled in one coloured complex cocktail or kept separate with a single probe for each one (step 3).

We also investigated whether cross-linking occurs during labelling. Here, before labelling, we mixed fully assembled QD-SpA-MAb probes with the counterpart QD-SpA complex (for example, QD625-SpA-MAb probe mixed with QD525-SpA complex, or vice versa) and incubated them with H1N1 virus-infected cells. Through this setup, if cross-linking exists, the excess of vacant counterpart QD-SpA complex would bind with any binding sites left on the Abs of the QD-SpA-MAb probes. The results display that there is no cross-linking or interference with QD625-SpA-MAb probes by QD525-SpA complex or vice versa because the QD525-SpA complex cannot bind to the QD625-Spa- MAb probe and the QD625-SpA complex cannot bind to the QD525-SpA-MAb probe (Fig. 2c) . If QD525-SpA and QD625-SpA complexes are mixed simultaneously with MAbs and then incubated together with the same cells, they efficiently captured free MAbs from solution and produced mixed-colour HA labelling with approximately a 50% contribution from each probe (Fig. 2d) .

In our study, by incubating QD-SpA complexes in excess with MAbs before labelling, nearly the complete capture of MAbs by QD-SpA is expected, therefore preventing the binding of free MAbs to vacant SpA sites on different QD-SpA probes. SpA possesses five IgG-binding sites, two of which are simultaneously accessible [18] , whereas IgG has two SpAbinding sites on its Fc region, making the formation of polymeric SpA-MAb complexes possible [17] . However, no Fig. 2 Virus detection in cells with QD-SpA-MAb probes. a H1N1 virus was labelled in virus-infected MDCK cells with a Bone-step procedureb y QD625-SpA-MAb or with a Btwo-step procedure^that was performed by first being incubated with MAbs and then with QD625-SpA.

The presence of a competitor QD525-SpA complex does not interfere with the target labelling by the fully assembled QD625-SpA-MAb probe during the labelling of H1N1 HA proteins. Similarly, the presence of the QD625-SpA complex does not interfere with target labelling by the QD525-SpA-MAb probe. When anti-HA MAb, QD525-SpA and QD625-SpA were mixed together and applied to infected cells, both of the QD525-SpA and QD625-SpA probes successfully capture MAbs and produce labelling signals. d Fluorescence quantification showed approximately 50% contributions for the QD525-SpA and QD625-SpA when they were mixed together with anti-HA MAb.

It is known that HA is located in the cytoplasm and along the cell surface [19] ; therefore, the QD705-SpA-MAb probe targeted HA either along the cell surface or inside the cytoplasm (Fig. 3a) . In contrast, the QD625-SpA-MAb probe targeting the hexon of HAdV-B3 showed a different subcellular distribution pattern from that for H1N1 at different post-infection time points. The QD signal targeting the hexon of HAdV-B3 was localized along the cell surface and inside the cytoplasm during the early infection phase (15 min, 4 h) and concentrated mainly in the nucleus during the late infection phase (8 h, 16 h) (Fig. 3b) . The HAdVs genome is transported into the nucleus, where viral gene transcription, viral DNA replication, and virion assembly occur [20] . Our observation is in agreement with the subcellular localization and functions of the hexon of HAdVs since the hexon plays roles in events occurring after internalization, such as transcriptional activation, and nuclear reorganization [20, 21] . These results from the detection of different viruses demonstrated that QD-SpA-MAb probes can be used to label different targets in different subcellular areas inside the cell. We also quantitatively evaluated the co-infection of influenza A viruses H1N1 and H3N2 at different post-infection time points. As shown in Fig. 4b and supplementary Fig. S4 , H1N1 and H3N2 viruses can be detected by QD625-SpA-MAb and QD525-SpA-MAb probes, respectively, in the same co-infected cells. Quantitative evaluation showed that both viruses replicated in their co-infected cells, but H3N2 virus replication had a lower quantity than that of the H1N1 virus (Fig. 4b) . The results are in line with previously published works, which indicated that there were notable differences in the proliferation between the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, as demonstrated by the multiplex RT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from the co-cultures of influenza H3N2 with H1N1 in MDCK cells [2] . Although both subtypes were able to infect MDCK cells initially, the coinfection of H1N1 and H3N2 would result in a decrease in the replication of H3N2.",

As shown in Fig. 5 , by using the one-step staining procedure with a cocktail of QD625-SpA-MAb, QD525-SpA-MAb and QD705-SpA-MAb probes, the three influenza A virus subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H9N2 were detected in the same co-infected MDCK cells with three types of corresponding QD signals (Fig. 5a) . When the MDCK cells were co-infected with two types of influenza A virus subtypes, the two types of corresponding QD signals were detected (Fig. 5b) . If there is only one type of virus subtype, only one corresponding QD signal can be detected (Fig. 5c) . Interestingly, no cross-talk and no colocalization were observed between the different probes within the staining cocktail, indicating that each QD-SpA-MAb probe was uniquely matched to a specific target. This result is in agreement with the previous report that the HA protein is subtype-specific and hence can be used to detect specific subtypes of influenza virus [22] . It is also worth emphasizing that these results suggest the usefulness of QD-SpA-MAb probes for the simultaneous identification and differentiation of multiple virus subtypes.",

With our method, to detect coinfection by different subtypes of influenza viruses, only the Abs in the QD-SpA probe need to be replaced with highly specific MAbs for different subtypes. This makes the QD-SpA-MAb probes the most versatile assay for simple and sensitive virus detection compared with the other methods for the detection of coinfection. For example, traditional direct antigen detection tests, including enzyme immunoassays and direct fluorescentantibody assays, suffer from poor sensitivity. The viral culture test is time-consuming and often not applicable [24, 25] . Likewise, serology to detect antibody response to infection may only produce positive results up to two weeks after infection [26] . The PCR method can raise the false negativity if there is a mutation of the target site [27] , or it may be caused by a mismatch between the primer and/or probe and its binding region [28] . Some more advanced methods, such as multiplex PCR, often produce false positive bands due to cross dimers forming between PCR primers [29] .",

The preparation procedure for these QD-SpA-MAb probes is a rapid, self-assembly and purification-free process. Within a single staining cycle, by using a cocktail of different coloured QD-SpA-MAb probes, multiple viruses in the same cell can be simultaneously imaged and analysed. Compared to other nanomaterials-based methods such as AuNPs/Ag staining [31] , magnetic beads [32, 33] , etc., the self-assembled QDbased method is flexible, sensitive, quantitative and prominent for multiple analysis, and thus is preferable for the coinfection detection in cell or tissue samples. Because one QD particle can be seen under microscope, the selfassembled quantum dot probes may be used to detect single targets of a virus. Of course, when the self-assembled quantum dot probes are used for virus detection, a protocol similar to that of immunofluorescence must be deployed. The differentiation ability of the new method also depends heavily on the antibody. For example, in our experiment, we can't differentiate HAdV subtypes because antibodies specifically for different HAdV subtypes are unavailable. Moreover, the antigenicity of the sample needs to be preserved for detection. Nevertheless, our study provides a platform to perform the simultaneous detection of multiple viruses in the same cell.",
