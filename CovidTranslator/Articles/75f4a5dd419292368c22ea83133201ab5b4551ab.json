The endogenous ER-retained immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein, protein disulfide isomerase, and a peptide containing the KDEL amino acid sequence appeared in the soma and dendrites up to their first branching, but not in axons. However, two other endogenous ER-associated proteins, calreticulin and calnexin, occurred in axons as well as in the somatodendritic domains. The ER-associated rotavirus proteins, VP7 and NSP4, were widely distributed in cell bodies and dendrites. The former appeared also in axons and its localization partially overlapped with that of calreticulin and calnexin. One intermediate compartment protein, ER-Golgi-intermediate compartment-protein-53 (ERGIC-53), extended beyond the first division of the dendrites and did not, as the small guanosine 5-triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein rab2, appear in axons. The location of rab2 to small vesicles was distinct from that of rotavirus VP7. Cis/medial Golgi cistern proteins were restricted to the cell bodies and proximal dendrites. This study emphasizes the marked heterogeneity in the targeting to axons and dendrites of proteins associated with ER and intermediate compartments. Therefore, the composition of axonal ER-retained molecules differs from that in the soma and this variation may reflect differences in functions between the ER compartments. Viral proteins are useful reporters for such heterogeneities and rotavirus VP7 may be a tool to reveal sorting signals for targeting of vesicular proteins to axons via a nonclassical Golgi-independent mechanism. Such signals may also determine viral targeting to different regions of the brain.",

In epithelial cells, viral proteins, which utilize the cell's metabolic machinery, have provided efficient tools as markers for intracellular protein transport because they can be distinguished from the cell's endogenous proteins and, therefore, permit the tracing of a protein from its site of origin to its destination. Certain proteins of enveloped ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses are targeted to the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells, while others to the basolateral domain. Such a selective viral protein distribution enables the study of protein sorting mechanisms [20, 38] .",

For these purposes, viruses that bud at the plasma membrane have commonly been used as reporters, but viruses that assemble on intracellular membranes are given increased interest [19] . In a series of studies using rotavirus, which assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we have made the interesting observation that two viral proteins, which both are retained in the ER [28] , show differences in their distribution in neurons. The nonstructural protein NSP4 remains in the cell body while the outer capsid protein VP7 appears also in axons. Although VP7 is a luminal ER-associated glycoprotein, its axonal transport could not be inhibited with brefeldin A [50] , which is a drug that disrupts the organization of the Golgi apparatus [7] , indicating that it can bypass the Golgi apparatus to reach the axons. The present study was undertaken with a view to compare the appearance of these newly formed viral proteins with the distribution of endogenous ER-retained proteins in neurons.",

One type was characterized by the presence of DRG neurons attached to a 354 WECLEWICZ, SVENSSON AND KRISTENSSON collagen matrix and maintained in media complemented with sera. The neurons were well preserved for long periods of time and were used after 12-14 days in culture. However, in spite of the use of antimitotic agents, non-neuronal cells tended to overgrow the neurons and their processes. In the other type of the DRG culture, the cells were seeded on the Matrigel substrate, which although effective in promoting the outgrowth of neuronal processes, could only maintain the cultures for a limited period of time. These cultures were maintained in serum-free medium, which diminished significantly the presence of nonneuronal cells and this allowed clear observations on axons. Such cultures were used for infection after 2 days in culture. In both types of cultures, the DRG neurons were characterized by the presence of well developed axons, which often formed thick bundles projecting from the cell bodies. The axonal processes were labeled with the antibody to tau (Fig. 1A) , while immunolabeling with the MAP2 antibody was confined to the cell bodies in both types of cultures ( Fig. 1B and C) . After infection with rotavirus, the distribution of these microtubuleassociated proteins was maintained. The rotavirus VP7 glycoprotein appeared in both cell bodies and axons (Fig. 1D ), but the NSP4 protein was restricted to the cell bodies even at 48 h after infection ( Fig. 1E and F) . The luminal endogenous ER-associated proteins showed marked heterogeneities in their distribution: calreticulin appeared both in the cell bodies and axons ( Fig. 2A) , while BiP ( Fig. 2B and C) and PDI, as well as the peptide containing the KDEL sequence ( Fig. 2E and F) , were seen only in the cell bodies of the neurons. There was no difference in the immunolabeling using the two different PDI mAbs. The transmembrane ER-associated protein calnexin was seen both in the cell bodies and axons (Fig. 2D) . This was also the case for the intercompartment protein rab2 immunopositivity, which was accentuated in distal axons (Fig. 2G) . The other intercompartment protein, ERGIC-53, was, on the other hand, restricted to the perikarya of the neurons (Fig. 2H and I) .

            "text": "WECLEWICZ, SVENSSON AND KRISTENSSON KDEL sequence was almost limited to cell bodies. This contrasts the present observation in which these two molecules, as well as the KDEL-peptide sequence, did not seem to enter the axons of the DRG neurons, but extended into dendrites of the hippocampal neurons. However, another soluble luminal ER-protein, calreticulin, appeared in axons of the DRG in spite of the fact that this protein also contains a KDEL sequence. Calreticulin is a major calcium-binding protein in nonmuscle cells [29, 30, 42] . The protein is galactosylated, which indicates that it must have passed through the trans Golgi cisterns, where galactosylation occurs, before being retrieved back to the ER [34] . It has been postulated that different ER-proteins can escape into different post-ER compartments and that ER-retained proteins can, therefore, be progressively retrieved from a series of positions along the secretory pathways [16, 24] . Besides calcium-binding effects, calreticulin also serves the function of a chaperone in the ER, where it acts in concert with the transmembrane ER-protein calnexin in the control of folding of glycoproteins [3, 13] . The cytoplasmic tail of calnexin carries a RKPRRE sequence that serves as a signal to localize this protein to the ER. In the present study these two chaperones co-localized not only in the somatodendritic domains but also in axons, which corroborates previous observations on the distribution of these proteins in rat and monkey cerebellar neurons [17, 53] . The intermediate compartment is an extensive structure of a complex tubulo-vesicular organization that transfers molecules from the ER to the Golgi apparatus [32, 33] . Proteins in this compartment may occupy different subregions [21] . Viral proteins have served as markers for protein transport through the intermediate compartment vesicles and certain viruses can also assemble and mature at this site. For instance, the hepatitis B virus surface antigen co-localizes with rab2 [15] and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein with rab2 and p58 [26, 36] . A coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, buds into intermediate compartment vesicles containing rab2 and p58, but also into PDI-containing structures [21] , and the ",

In the present study the endogenous intermediate compartment protein ERGIC-53 was confined to the cell bodies and dendrites, while rab2 was found in both dendrites and axons. The latter observation is in contrast to the study on hippocampal neurons by Krijnse-Locker et al. [22] , in which rab2 could not be detected in axons. In the DRG axons, the small rab2 vesicles did not colocalize with the VP7 protein, which indicates that also in axons the intermediate compartment vesicles are distinct from the ER. Rab2 belongs to the family of GTP-binding proteins, which use GTP hydrolysis to catalyze the association of recognition molecules in the docking of vesicles and target membranes in a cell [35, 46] . Rab2 is considered to be involved in the traffic between ER and cis Golgi cisterns and its appearance in axons, in which Golgi apparatus is lacking, is unexpected. In cultured rat embryonic neurons, obtained from tectum and ventral midbrain, injection of purified rab2 protein caused an enhanced adhesion of the cells and an increased outgrowth of dendrite-like neurites. It was suggested that the protein may be involved in the transport and fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane at the level of the growth cones [2] . In rotavirus-infected neurons the distribution of ER-associated proteins was the same as in controls, indicating that the neurons polarity is maintained during the observation period. The two rotavirus proteins, VP7 and NSP4, which both lack a KDEL sequence, showed marked differences in their distribution. The NSP4 protein had a polarized distribution and appeared in the somatodendritic domain of the neurons, while the VP7 protein also occurred in axons. The NSP4 protein seemed to be distinct in its distribution from the other ER-associated proteins. It did not enter axons but extended into dendrites beyond the level of BiP and PDI. NSP4 is a nonstructural transmembrane rough ER viral protein. It has been suggested to serve as a receptor for subviral particles in the cytosol to mediate their budding through the ER membrane in the process of virus morphogenesis [9] . The motif for retaining the high mannose containing NSP4 to the rough ER has not been identified. In addition to its role as a receptor, NSP4 has been suggested to regulate the intracellular calcium levels of infected cells. This may promote the acquisition of correct protein configuration during virus maturation, but may also be involved in the cytotoxicity [45] .",

Previously, we have observed that VP7 does not pass through the Golgi apparatus on its way to axons [50] . The mechanisms by which the endo-H sensitive VP7 is retained in the ER remains an interesting question in cell biology since it does not contain a KDEL or RKPRRE sequence and it is not membrane spanning. Although the localization of VP7 and calreticulin to axonal ER-like structures may be similar, their routes to reach this compartment may differ; calreticulin being transferred through the Golgi apparatus to become galactosylated and VP7 being directly transferred. Anatomically, a direct communication between the rough ER of the nerve cell bodies and the smooth ER of the axons has repeatedly been proposed [4, 14, 25, 37] and VP7 may, therefore, be a reporter to study this route of delivery of molecules to axons. Recently, a nonclassical pathway for vesicular transport to the apical cell surface that bypasses the Golgi apparatus has been detected also in epithelial cells by the use of rotavirus [18] .",
