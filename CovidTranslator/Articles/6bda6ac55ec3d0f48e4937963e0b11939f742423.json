Rhinovirus infection has also been associated with nearly half of all chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations [5] . Furthermore, the presence of two or more viral agents may contribute to the severity of exacerbations. Wilkinson et al. have reported that a total of 70 % of COPD exacerbations in the UK were associated with the bacterial pathogen Haemophilus influenzae, and rhinovirus was identified in 20 % of exacerbations [6] . However, higher bacterial loads were observed in exacerbations with both rhinovirus and H. influenzae, thus suggesting that interaction between these pathogens may contribute to exacerbation severity [6] .",

Negative controls were carried out with water instead of RNA. PCR runs were carried out according to the standard TaqMan \u00d2 PCR profile. Amplification of target DNA and detection of PCR products were performed using an ABI machine. Amplification of the target sequence was detected as an increase in fluorescence above a baseline with no or little change in fluorescence. In order to analyse the data, the reporter (FAM) fluorescence was automatically normalised to a passive reference to avoid the measurement of non-PCRrelated fluorescence. A threshold was set above the baseline, and the threshold cycle value (Ct) was defined as the cycle number at which the fluorescence passes the fixed threshold and a statistically significant increase in fluorescence is first detected.",

A value of p \\ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 200 adult patients (135 females and 65 males) were enrolled: 159 patients of Arab origin and 41 patients of non-Arab origin. All patients were aged C18 years (average age of asthma patients = 48 yr [ranges; n = 32 for 20-35 yr; n = 105 for 35-55 yr; n = 53 for [55 yr]; average age COPD patients = 62 yr [ranges n = 0 for 20-35 yr; n = 3 for 35-55 yr; n = 7 for [55 yr). The majority of the patients had asthma (190 asthma patients vs. 10 patients with COPD). None of the COPD patients and 21 of the asthma patients had received an influenza vaccine over the last two years. Fourteen of the asthma patients and five of the COPD patients were smokers. Table 2 Both groups of patients with viral infections and those without viral infections shared the same symptoms, with cough and wheezing being the most common in both groups (Table 3 ). However, among the patients suffering from viral infection, those infected with rhinovirus had the most severe symptoms compared with other viruses (results not shown here). Dry cough was the predominant symptom among patients with rhinovirus (n = 7) and coronavirus infections (n = 10). Chi square analysis demonstrated that the correlation between the symptoms and the presence of the virus was non-significant (p C 0.05). No significant relationship was observed between specific symptoms and age or ethnic origin. Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses usually cause self-limited and harmless upper respiratory illnesses. However, these viruses have been associated with exacerbations in patients with asthma and COPD. Our study is the first in Qatar to analyse the clinical aetiology of respiratory tract viral infections in adult patients from all age groups with asthma or COPD. However, it is important to note that our study did not investigate the viral aetiology in patients with exacerbations. All patients were stable at time of recruitment and sample collection. To our knowledge, there are no other studies in which the frequency of respiratory viruses in adults with asthma/COPD in the Middle East has been reported. Rhinovirus was the most common viruses identified, followed by coronaviruses. The COPD sample was too small to allow any specific conclusions regarding viral aetiology. However, in the COPD population, the corona viruses were the most common viral infectious agents.",

We found that the distribution of viral infections did not correlate with the age and ethnic background of the patient. However, the effects of smoking were difficult to evaluate due to the small number of smokers in the population. In the last several years, respiratory virus infections have been identified in [50 % of wheezing episodes in adults [1, 3, 9] . Furthermore, in several studies, rhinovirus has been identified as the most common respiratory virus associated with asthma exacerbations, and coronavirus is the second most frequent [3, 4] . Our findings in the Qatari population corroborate data from previous studies and present the first of such studies in Qatar, albeit in adult asthma and a minority of COPD patients with no exacerbations [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . It is possible that the aetiology of viral infection would differ if samples were analysed during an exacerbation. Furthermore, while most studies have focused on the paediatric population, this is one of the few studies that examines viral aetiology in adults.",

Larger studies are needed to verify the current data. The number of COPD patients was markedly smaller than that of asthma patients. This was mainly because patients with asthma may be more concerned for their health, especially when they suffer from upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), and go to the hospital, while COPD patients may not consider their symptoms very serious. Indeed, there is very poor education and awareness of COPD in Qatar among physicians and patients. In addition, there is a large population of COPD smoker patients in Qatar who are not aware of their disease status. Larger numbers of COPD patients must be enrolled in order to determine viral aetiology more accurately in this population. Furthermore, an equal number of females and males also need to be included in future studies.",

The 13 patients with rhinovirus infection belonged to the asthma group. Of the 11 patients with coronavirus infection, 8 had asthma and 3 had COPD.",
