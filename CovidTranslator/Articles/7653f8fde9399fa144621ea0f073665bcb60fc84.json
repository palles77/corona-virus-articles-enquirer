The processing and intracellular transport of these proteins have been examined by transient expression of the cDNAs in COS cells. Compared to alphaviruses, processing of RV glycoprotein moieties occurred relatively slowly and the transport of glycoproteins E2 and El to the plasma membrane was inefficient. Indirect immunofluoresence revealed that the majority of RV antigen in transfected and infected COS cells was localized to the Golgi region, including the capsid protein. Accumulation of capsid protein in the juxtanuclear region was determined to be RV glycoprotein dependent. Unlike alphaviruses, RV El did not require E2 for targeting to the Golgi where it was retained. E2 was however necessary for cell surface expression of El. This study revealed that the processing and transport of RV structural proteins is quite different from alphaviruses and that the accumulation of antigens in the Golgi region may be significant in light of previous reports which suggest that RV buds from the internal membranes in SOfIle Cell typeS. 0 1990Academic Press, Inc.",

It is the sole member of the genus Rubivirus and bears striking similarities to the prototype alphaviruses Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Sindbis virus (SV) in terms of genome organization and structural protein expression strategy. Unlike alphaviruses however, RV infection in cultured cells is characterized by relatively long latency periods, slow replication, and limited cytopathology. As well as being able to establish persistent infections in all cell lines tested (Cunningham and Fraser, 1985; Norval, 1979; Stanwick and Hallum, 1974) , RV is known to persist in viva in humans after congenital and postnatal infections (Cooper and Buimovici-Kein, 1985) . Moreover initiation of a persistent infection in cultured cells by RV is not dependent upon the presence of defective-interfering particles (Frey and Hemphill. 1988) .",

We have recently demonstrated that insertion of glycoproteins El and E2 into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is mediated by two independently functioning signal peptides and that two of the ~110 cleavages are likely to be catalyzed by signal peptidase (Hobman et al., 1988; Hobman and Gillam, 1989) . In alphaviruses, formation of an El -E2 heterodimer is required for transport of El out of the ER lumen to the Golgi and plasma membrane , where budding occurs by binding of nucleocapsids to the membrane-anchored glycoprotein spikes (for review see Garoff et al., 1982) . In contrast, electron microscopy studies revealed that RV budding occurs preferentially from internal membranes in BHK cells and at the plasma membrane in Vero cells (Bardeletti et a/., 1979; von Bonsdorff and Vaheri, 1969) .",

            "text": "We have been studying the processing and intracellular transport of RV structural proteins in mammalian cells and are particularly interested in defining the requirements for transport of the glycoproteins out of the ER and the roles of the structural proteins in the virus assembly process. Previously it has been shown that RV E2 glycoprotein, like its alphavirus counterpart, can be transported to the plasma membrane in the absence of El (Hobman and Gillam, 1989; Kondor-Koch et al., 1982) . In the present study we have addressed the post-ER fates of the RV glycoproteins in COS cells and also discuss the role of capsid protein in the processing of El and E2. RV cDNAs encoding C-E2-El, E2-El, E2, and El have been subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector containing the human cytomegalovirus immediate early gene promoter, which allowed high level transient expression of RV structural proteins in COS cells. Expression of RV structural proteins in transfected cells suggests that unlike SFV and SV El glycoproteins, RV El is transported to the Golgi complex in the absence of E2, although E2 seems to be required for cell surface expression of El. The presence of El increased the rate of ER to Golgi transport of E2 as monitored by acquisition of endoglycosidase H (endo H)-resistant glycans. Much to our surprise, the rate of E2 processing was slower in the presence of capsid protein, which was found to be concentrated in a juxtanuclear region in transfected COS cells, as well as in RV-infected cells. In pulse-chase experiments with transfected COS ceils, we were only able to chase a small fraction of the RV antigen to the cell surface, indicating that the transport of RV glycoproteins was restricted in these cells. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed a high concentration of RV antigen in the Golgi region of transfected and infected cells. Our results suggest that maturation of RV structural antigens is quite different from that of alphaviruses and is consistent with the possibilrty that assembly of RV pat-tiles may begin on internal membranes.",

Lysates from COS cells transfected with pCMV5 recombrnant plasmids were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with human anti-RV serum followed by rabbit anti-human IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. 42.kDa (G) and 39-kDa (ER) forms of E2 are Indicated. Disrupted RV vinons were included to indicate the relatrve positrons of the mature structural proteins, of expression of one ortwo of the RV structural proteins affected the rate of E2 and El glycan processing. Plasmids were transfected into COS cells and labeled RV proteins were immunoprecipitated and treated with endo H to monitor processing of N-linked sugars. Appearance of endo H-resistant sugar moeities on the glycoproteins was taken as evidence that the RV glycoproteins had entered the Golgi complex (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985) . Figure 2A shows the results of a pulsechase experiment using pCMV5-24S-transfected COS cells. After a 30 min pulse with [35S]methionine, RVspecific proteins the size of El and C were detected, as well as an E2 band of 39,000 D migrating just above the capsid band. Present in much smaller amounts are proteins of approximately 75 kDa, an 85-kDa doublet, and >lOO kDa. The 75.kDa protein was subsequently determined to be the resident ER protein BiP by using a monoclonal antibody to BiP (Bole et a/., 1986) to immunoprecipitate lysates from transfected COS cells (data not shown). Digestion with endo H reduced the size of El and E2 to 51 and 32 kDa, respectively, indicating the presence of high mannose sugars on these proteins. Chase with excess unlabeled methionine resulted in conversion of E2 to a 42-kDa glycoprotein, while the size of El and C remained unchanged. The 42-kDa (G) form of E2 was assumed to be a population of E2 that had entered the medial Golgi stacks and been processed by Golgi-specific glycan modifying enzymes, while the 39.kDa (ER) form was thought to be ER or-c&-Golgi-associated (Hobman and Gillam, 1989) .",

The most likely reason COS cells containing pCMV5-E2 synthesize a 38-kDa E2 versus a 39-kDa E2 (found in cells transfected with pCMV524S or -E2El) is that there is a stop codon linker engineered into the C-terminal coding region of E2 in pCMV5-E2. Endo H digestion reduced the molecular weight of the 43,000 and 38,000 glycoproteins to 36,000 and 31,000 respectively. glycosylated E2 is known to be 30-31 kDa in size (Oker-Blom et al., 1983; Clarke et al., 1988; Hobman and Gillam, 1989) . The 43-kDa E2 protein was no longer detectable after a 30-min chase with unlabeled methionine, while the 38-kDa protein underwent heterogeneous processing of the N-linked glycans, presumably by Golgi-specific enzymes. The nature of the short-lived 43-kDa protein is uncertain, but may represent a population of E2 that is rapidly transported through the Golgi to the cell surface followed by degradation in the lysosomes (Rizzolo, 1989) .",

Figure 5 shows that in live unpermeablized COS cells expressing PC-MV5-24S, only El and E2 become accessible to antibody in a time-dependent manner. No capsid protein was detected at the plasma membrane even after a 180-min chase period indicating that this technique allowed distinction between cell surface and intracellular antigens. The predominant form of E2 at the plasma membrane was the 42-kDa form which is expected since this form of E2 is believed to contain Golgi-processed glycans (Fig. 5) . Compared to alphaviral glycoproteins, movement of the RV antigen to the cell surface occurred relatively slowly with the vast majority of El and E2 (>90%) still found in the intracellular fraction after the 3-h chase period (Fig. 5) . In BHK-21 cells, newly synthesized Sindbis virus glycoproteins are incorporated into virions at the plasma membrane as little as 30 min after synthesis (Erwin and Brown, 1980) . lmmunofluorescence Indirect immunofluorescence was used to determine the subcellular location of RV structural proteins in transfected and infected cells. Cells expressing PC-MV5-24s and pCMV5-E2El displayed strong fluorescence in a juxtanuclear region likely corresponding to the Golgi apparatus as indicated by costaining of this region with WGA (Figs. 6A-6D) (Virtanen et al., 1980) .",

El localized primarily to the juxtanuclear region of M33-infected and pCMV5-24S-transfected cells (Figs. 10A and 1OB ). In addition to staining the Golgi region, a significant amount of E2 was found in the ER as evidenced by staining of the nuclear envelope and reticular formations by anti-E2 antibodies (Figs. 1 OC and 1 OD) . The distribution of El and E2 in pCMV5-E2El -transfected cells was similar to those in M33-infected cells and cells expressing pCMV5-24s (not shown). Infected cells also contained E2 in vesicular structures which seemed to radiate from the juxtanuclear region (Fig. 1 OD) . Surprisingly, capsid protein was concentrated in the Golgi area of M33-infected cells and cells expressing pCMV5-24s (Figs. 1 OE and 1 OF). Two control experiments were employed to ensure that the Golgi-specific localization of capsid protein was not artifactual. First, capsid-specific staining was not observed in cells transfected with pCMV5-E2El (Figs. 1 OG and 1 OH) . Second, to determine if the glycoproteins were necessary for the juxtanuclear lo- calization of capsid protein, COS cells were transfected with pSVL-RV2, which encodes the entire capsid gene and the amino-terminal one-third of E2 (Clarke et al., 1988) . We found that pSVL-RV2-transfected cells exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern when stained with anti-capsid antibodies (Fig. 101) and suggest that the concentration of capsid in the Golgi area may be mediated by interaction with the spike glycoproteins which are embedded in the Golgi membranes.",

            "text": "In the present study we have examined the maturation and intracellular transport of RV structural proteins in COS cells using RV cDNAs which allowed the coordinate and individual expression of C, E2, and El proteins. Pulse-chase experiments showed that E2 initially was detected as a 39-kDa glycoprotein containing only endo H-sensitive sugars (Hobman and Gillam, 1989) . This high mannose containing glycoprotein was converted into a 42-kDa species by glycan processing enzymes in the Golgi compartments. Although this process occurred in the absence of El (Hobman and Gillam, 1989) , the rate of ER to Golgi transport of E2 was markedly increased in the presence of El. In addition, pulse-chase experiments showed that processing of E2 occurred even more rapidly in the absence of capsid protein. These data were also supported by examining steady-state levels of RV antigen in transfected cells. Oker-Blom et al. (1983) report that E2 was found exclusively as a 41 -kDa protein in infected cells, whereas in virions it exists as a heterogeneous species 42-47 kDa in size. We believe the 42-kDa E2 (G) form of E2 in transfected cells corresponds to the 4 1 -kDa E2 found in infected cells. Expression of a RV E2El construct in Sf9 cells by Oker-Blom et al. (1989) revealed also that E2 was synthesized as a 39-kDa high mannose glycoprotein. In contrast to the present study, their E2 could not be demonstrated to acquire endo H-resistant sugars after a 3-hr chase period even though Sf9 cells are able to synthesize endo H-resistant sugars (Jatvis and Summers, 1988) . From our results it would appear that processing of RV E2 glycans rnvolves at least two stable intermediates, a 39-kDa high mannose precursor, and a 42.kDa form bearing some complex sugars. Unlike alphaviral E2 glycoproteins, RV E2 is not derived from a larger intermediate glycosylated precursor . Previously it was thought that the heterogeneous processing of E2 glycans occurred late in virus maturation (Oker-Blom et a/., 1983) , although it is clear from our results that virion formation is not necessary for this process to take place. The biological significance of this phenomenon remains to be determined.",

In addition to a 45-kDa acylated E2, both the 39. and 42-kDa species of E2 incorporated palmitate. Furthermore, the proportions of the high and low molecular weight forms of E2 (low M, = 39 kDa; high M, = 42 and 45 kDa) in the transfected cells correlated well with the E2 processing kinetics from pulsechase experiments. Cells expressing pCMV5E2 contained predominantly 39-kDa E2, whereas pCMV5-24s and pCMV5-E2El contained proportionally more of the 42-and 45-kDa species. Covalent attachment of palmitic acid to proteins is a post-translational modification thought to occur immediately prior to exit from the ER (Berger and Schmidt, 1985; Rose and Doms, 1988) . However, more recent evidence suggests that this process takes place in a post-ER-pre-Golgi compartment (Bonatti et al., 1989) . In light of the latter study, the fact that acylation of RV El occurs in the absence of E2 is evidence that, unlike alphaviral El glycoproteins RV El can exit the ER without binding to E2.",

            "text": "Indirect immunofluorescence revealed that El glycoprotein localized exclusively to the Golgi region in pCMV5-El-transfected cells. A small fraction of El was seen to acquire endo H-resistant sugars which is consistent with the idea that RV El does not require E2 for ER to Golgi transport. Using oligonucleotide-di- rected mutagenesis we have determined that El contains three N-linked sugars, and in COS cells only one of the glycans seems to be processed to the complex type (unpublished observations). No El was detected on the plasma membrane in significant quantities except when coexpressed with E2. In coronavirus-infected cells, the El glycoprotein is targeted to and retained in the Golgi, and is believed to determine the site of virus budding (Rottier and Rose, 1987) . Since budding of RV from the Golgi region has been reported in some cells (Bardelleti eta/., 1979; von Bonsdotff and Vaheri, 1969) , targeting of RV El to the Golgi may be important for this process. Although El seemed to require binding of E2 for transport to the cell surface, this binding did not seem to involve the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds (data not shown) as previously reported (Waxham and Wolinsky, 1983) , and could occur when El and E2 were expressed from different mRNAs. It follows that a possible function of E2 may be to promote movement of the glycoprotein spikes and/or virions from the Golgi to the cell surface.",

Cells infected with M33 and cells transfected with pCMV5-24s were found to have capsid concentrated in the juxtanuclear region. We interpreted this to be due to interaction of capsid protein with the cytoplasmic domains of the spike glycoproteins embedded in the Golgi and ER membranes. Kuismanen el a/. (1982) reported a similar distribution of capsid protein in cells infected with Uukeniemi virus which is known to bud from Golgi membranes. In contrast, colocalization of capsid protein with the Golgi is not observed in cells microinjected with genes encoding SFV structural proteins or SFV-infected cells, unless the cells are first treated with monensin to induce budding at internal membranes Kuismanen et a/., 1982) . Presumably during budding of RV there is a capsid-spike interaction, which may account for the capsid-associated delay in E2 and El processing in transfected cells. Whether or not capsid protein modulates spike glycoprotein movement in infected cells remains to be determined.",

Consistent with the immunofluorescence data, only El and E2 (>42 kDa) were transported to the plasma membrane. The amount of RV on the surface of infected cells detectable by immunofluorescence was also very limited. Although comparable amounts of El and E2 were delivered to the plasma membrane after 3 hr con-version of El glycans to endo H-resistant types occurred more slowly than 39-to 42-kDa E2 conversion in biosynthetic labeling experiments. Coprecipitation of BiP with El and E2 from transfected cells was observed; however the significance of this phenomenon remains to be determined. Due to a shortage of anti-BiP antibody we were unable to determine if the association of BiP with the RV glycoproteins was transient, or whether a fraction of El and E2 was permanently retained in the ER by BiP.",

            "text": "We have presented evidence which suggests that maturation and intracellular transport of RV structural proteins is quite different from those of alphaviruses, and in at least two respects resembles coronaviruses and Uukeniemi virus which both bud from Golgi membranes. Furthermore, limiting the amount of RV antigen on the surface of infected cells could provide a means to evade immune surveillance, and possibly be a contributing factor to the establishment and maintenance of persistent infection in vivo. Generally the rate-limiting step in transport of proteins through the exocytic pathway is passage from the ER to the Golgi (Lodish, 1988) . In the case of RV glycoproteins, the site of accumulation appears to be the Golgi complex. Attaining and maintaining a high concentration of spike glycoproteins in the Golgi membranes may be intrinsic to this virus's ability to bud from internal membranes in certain cell types.",
