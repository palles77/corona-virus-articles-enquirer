            "text": "From May to July 2015, there was a nation-wide outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Korea. MERS is caused by MERS-CoV, an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae. Despite expert opinions that the danger of MERS might be exaggerated, there was an overreaction by the public according to the Korean mass media, which led to a noticeable reduction in social and economic activities during the outbreak. To explain this phenomenon, we presumed that machine learning-based analysis of media outlets would be helpful and collected a number of Korean mass media articles and short-text comments produced during the 10-week outbreak. To process and analyze the collected data (over 86 million words in total) effectively, we created a methodology composed of machine-learning and information-theoretic approaches. Our proposal included techniques for extracting emotions from emoticons and Internet slang, which allowed us to significantly (approximately 73%) increase the number of emotion-bearing texts needed for robust sentiment analysis of social media. As a result, we discovered a plausible explanation for the public overreaction to MERS in terms of the interplay between the disease, mass media, and public emotions.",

A large outbreak of MERS occurred in Korea from May to July 2015 [3, 4] . Although the country had advanced medical systems with reliable public health monitoring capabilities, the outbreak, which started with a single case, caused massive public fear, affecting various aspects of civil life. Inappropriate initial responses and insufficient information were believed to cause unnecessary social chaos [5] [6] [7] . Because of worries about infection, the majority of the public refrained from performing normal social and economic activities [8] [9] [10] . For example, owing to a sharp decrease in Chinese tourists, the Korea Tourism Organization (KTO) reported that the number of tourists in June decreased by 41% compared with the previous year [11] . As a result, the country had to experience lower economic growth than originally estimated before the outbreak, even though the Korean government declared a de facto end to the MERS outbreak on July 28, 2015, approximately 10 weeks after the first confirmed case [12] .",

Dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) are known to be the natural source of infection in human, and consumption of contaminated milk, urine, or meat as well as direct contact with infected camels is the suspected transmission route [16] . In addition, humanto-human transmission through close contact of an infected individual with family members and health care workers was also confirmed [18, 19] . For example, Chen X. et al.

Various attempts have been made to develop vaccines against MERS-CoV, and they are based on inactivated or attenuated viruses, viral vectors, virus-like particles, DNAs, or recombinant viral proteins [26] . In particular, subunit vaccines containing Receptor binding domain (RBD) of viral S protein has been shown to elicit strong neutralizing antibody responses in mice, representing a great potential for effective MERS-CoV vaccine development [27, 28] . In addition, RBD is an attractive therapeutic target of anti-MERS-CoV drugs [26] . The RBD binds to CD26 or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) expressed on epithelial cells and initiates infection of the host cells [29] .

To provide a more detailed explanation, we present an example of the use of an LDA model on MERS article data. Our data contains 229,448 documents. After removing stop words, we deleted the words that occurred less than 20 times. Finally, we obtained a total of 18,589 unique words. Then, we used the EM algorithm to determine the Dirichlet and conditional multinomial parameters for a 3-topic LDA model. The top words from some of the resulting multinomial distributions are illustrated in Fig. 6(b) . In the LDA, these distributions are expected to capture underlying topics in the corpus. We grouped the words in the corpus according to these resulting distributions of individual word, and then we named each group based on the words in the group (disease, government/politics, and economy). In step B4, we computed the daily fraction of each topic to draw Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 10(a) .",

For the set of short-text comments made on each day, we then measured the emotional proximity score with the topic words using the EPF scores defined as above, thus monitoring the trend of emotional changes of the public. Of note is the effectiveness of the emotion separation we proposed. As stated in the final paragraph of Section 5, we could substantially boost the number of emotion-bearing words using our approach.

We used first-order differencing to obtain a stationary time-series as implemented in many other studies [48] [49] [50] that focused on infectious disease surveillance data. We also added ACF (auto correlation function) and PACF (partial auto correlation function) plots to identify stationarity in Fig. 2 . It is one of the widest used tools in time-series analysis. We then computed the TE values from these time series to generate the results shown in Fig. 4 . This was to quantify the information transfers between the variables.

The cross-correlation analysis shown in Fig. 5 (b) reveals that these time series have high correlation with one-to eight-day delays. In particular, the delay information allows us to conduct an interesting interpretation of MERS-media interactions. First, only a one-day delay was observed between the confirmed MERS cases and the articles, which implies the immediate news coverage of confirmed cases. Second, there was approximately a two-day delay from the news article series to the quarantined people series, whereas there was longer eightday delay from the confirmed case series to the quarantined people series. Monitoring media articles thus provided a rapid indicator of the trend in the number of quarantined people.",

To link this observation to the explanation of the overreaction to MERS, scrutinizing the influence relationships shown in Fig. 4 (b) is helpful. It is obvious that the outbreak of an infectious disease will affect public emotions, as indicated by the arrow with the TE of 0.79.

Due to the high death rate, mass media reacted excessively (Fig. 9b) , which then triggered an unnecessarily high level of fear among the public (as indicated by the edge with 0.53 TE in Fig. 4b) . Such a high level of reaction to news articles was likely to make the reporters write more and more MERSrelated articles (as predicted by the edge with 0.52 TE in Fig. 4b) . Accordingly, a positive feedback loop was created between the mass media and public emotion variables, thus creating an overreaction to MERS.

In essence, the following points are worth mentioning: First, the Word2Vec approach, which was originally developed for Western languages, could successfully be applied to an East Asian language. Second, our approach for extracting emotion from a text word was effective in increasing the number of emotion-bearing words in social media corpora, which typically consist of short texts, making it difficult to perform sentiment analysis. For instance, by the proposed emotion separation technique, we could increase the number of emotion-bearing words from 582,448 to 1,010,945 (out of a total of 25,934,307 words in the short-text comment data), yielding a 73.6% increase.",

Our methodology is based on analyzing the massive media outlet data collected during the nation-wide outbreak of MERS in Korea in 2015. To provide a plausible explanation of the public overreaction to MERS observed in Korea, we focused on the interplay between the disease, mass media, and the public emotions, discovering an intriguing loop of information transfers between the media and the public. Moreover, using our methodology, we reported various in-depth analysis results that would be helpful for alleviating the unnecessary fear and overreaction of the public regarding infectious diseases occurring in the future. In this regard, we anticipate that our approach will provide an efficient way of rapidly monitoring the reaction of the public to a nation-scale infectious disease, revealing useful information for timely control of the disease.",
