In multivariate analysis, volume was associated with improved in-hospital mortality, but there was no reduction in mortality when volume was increased within a given hospital. However, the proportion of patients treated in highvolume centers has increased over time, inferring the importance of high-volume centers in improved outcomes.

            "text": "The association between hospital volumes and surgical outcomes has been well documented for many high-risk surgical procedures, including surgery for lung cancer. [1] [2] [3] [4] In the United States, a large body of evidence suggests a consistent relationship between larger hospital volumes and improved short-term outcomes for lobectomy and pneumonectomy. [4] [5] [6] Improvements in long-term outcomes are also related to institutional volume. 4 There is also a suggestion that institu-tional designation as a cancer center provides improved outcomes beyond volume. 7 The evidence for this volumeoutcome relationship is somewhat controversial, however, because there are several studies from the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States that fail to show any benefit to hospital volume on outcome in pulmonary resections. [8] [9] [10] Furthermore, many smaller institutions are considered to deliver high-quality care and have among the most favorable outcomes reported in the literature. 11 There is no universally accepted volume standard for a large-volume center, with many publications quoting differing thresholds. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons database, 12 a voluntary dedicated thoracic database, reports a median of 31.4 lobectomies per participant per year, but numbers range from 1 to 128. Hospital lobectomy volumes ranging from 19 to 37 per year have been considered large volume, 1,13 and in Canada, Ontario has set a standard of 150 anatomic lung resections per year as a target for high-volume centers. 14 In searching for a volume threshold above which outcomes are improved, factors other than volume are often found to have more influence on the variability in outcomes. 15 The evidence for a positive relationship between hospital volumes and surgical outcomes has led to the suggestion that care be regionalized primarily in large-volume centers. 16 In Canada, thoracic surgery services have been formally regionalized in British Columbia and Ontario as a result of this literature with added funding and resources being added to facilitate optimum care in 2001 and 2004, respectively. 14, 17 In the largest province of Ontario, the regionalization came with necessary requirements for facilities and availability of specialized care. Informally, many other provinces have amalgamated existing smaller centers to effectively regionalize their services without explicit added resources. Several authors caution about potential untoward side effects of regionalization policies, 11 and as yet, the effect of manipulating hospital volumes on surgical outcomes for patients has not been established. Authors theorize that patient outcomes will be improved by increasing an institution's volume or alternatively by referring patients to existing high-volume centers.",

Thus, it is likely that the decrease in mortality is associated with a larger proportion of lobectomies being delivered in high-volume centers and the cessation of the lowervolume institutions with their associated average higher mortality. This suggests that for lobectomy in Canada, the volume-outcome relationship is best optimized by selective referral to existing large-volume institutions.",

Whether this added effect reflects improved staging, surgical selection, or early interventions on critically ill patients 25 is unclear. The increasing availability of video-assisted lobectomy offers a potential surgical factor that may contribute to improved outcomes in larger institutions, but the adoption of this technique in Canada is still ongoing, and with the limitations of the coding, its effect is inaccessible.

Other important markers, such as forced expiratory volume in 1 second, carbon monoxide diffusion in the lung, and exercise testing, are not available in the Canadian Institute for Health Information database and are not part of the Charlson index. In our study, IHM and LOS did not change uniformly with progressive Charlson comorbidity scores as would be expected. This could be explained by the expected worse outcomes in patients undergoing anatomic lung resection for inflammatory reasons, many of whom would have a correspondingly lower Charlson score. As such, each score was analyzed separately and not linearly to account for this effect. Furthermore, although the Charlson index accounts for malignancy, we do not have stage information in our database, which limits our ability to control for patients with more advanced disease, although arguably this should not affect short-term outcome in well-selected patients.",

Because the results were consistent across the study period, however, this is likely not a significant factor. The Charlson comorbidity index is formed from ICD coding, but it has been shown that the change in coding did not affect its performance in capturing comorbidity. [20] [21] [22] There has been active promotion of the concept of regionalization of thoracic surgery services to high-volume centers based on the quantity of cross-sectional evidence for volume-outcome relationships. Our results support the crosssectional relationship between short-term outcomes and higher-volume centers. In addition, we show that, over time, there has been an improvement in short-term mortality, and this change is in part due to more cases being done in higher-volume centers rather than within-hospital improvement. These results support the idea that services should continue to be regionalized to high-volume centers. However, regionalization is clearly more than just volume and includes other processes of care that we have not measured, such as specialized services, staff, and experience. This study suggests that systematic initiatives in regionalization of thoracic surgery are moving us forward in improving outcomes of patients undergoing lobectomy. It also underscores the importance of outcome data collection and analysis going forward to accurately assess the efficacy of our attempts to improve the quality and efficiency of health care delivery.",

They were very organized about it and moved different physicians to centralized centers and added resources to those centers. Alberta was more informal and did not have a formal regionalization process, but did move surgeons into centralized locations. Ontario, with the largest population, has had the biggest effect. About 2004, Ontario started the process, which is still ongoing. That is probably why we see the largest change in volume at the tail end because of the study period.",

I think one of the most influential articles I read in the last year was by Amir Ghaferi, in The New England Journal of Medicine, who suggested that the difference between a low-mortality hospital and a high-mortality hospital had nothing to do with complication rates, which were exactly the same. It was the ability of rescue; it was the ability to pull those patients out of the fire once the morbidity occurs.

In the United States there is a financial incentive for hospitals to code more, and I am curious to know across the provinces during the time of your study, were there any financial incentives and did you notice an increase in the number of ICD-9 codes over time?",

Hospitals in some provinces are remunerated on the comorbidities of their patients, so there could be a slight trend there. That said, the Canadian Institute of Health information goes back and examines the hospitals on their coding systems and publishes regular reports on the accuracy and validity of those reports, and it has actually been quite reliable. That said, within our data it is internally consistent from year to year, so I don't think there was a drift in that way.",

That hospital now has a 10% mortality. He goes to a big hospital, bigger center, say 100 cases per year, and dies. That is a 1% mortality. So it seems that smaller centers are kind of inherently disadvantaged. It is a bit like setting up a transplant program. If you do a small volume the first year and have a mortality, you have a bad set of numbers.",

As I said, there are some tremendous small-volume hospitals, and I think all of us worry about how to evaluate institutions in a fair way, and that is why on a population basis we look at all the hospitals lumped together. There are hospitals that do a very good job, and trying to elucidate which hospitals actually have a statistically significant deviation from an acceptable threshold is difficult to do in real life, because a hospital that performs 10 lobectomies per year would require 4 or 5 years of evaluation to know if they actually drifted off of statistically acceptable level. So you are right, in a given year in a given hospital, it is unfair to disadvantage them, but this is a population-based study, so we are looking from 20,000 feet and lumping those groups together.",

In British Columbia, again, with the concentration of specialized surgeons, there has been specialized nursing and education in those centers. In Ontario, again with the concentration of care and incentives to the hospital, those other vital services are strengthened. There are guidelines that were published in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery with recommendations for a single-payer system, and they listed a number of criteria that would be useful for those regionalized centers, including 24-hour interventional radiology, intensive care, and ancillary staff such as specialized nursing and respiratory therapy.
