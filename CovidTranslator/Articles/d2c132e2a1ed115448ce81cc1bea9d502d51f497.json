The receptor for PIV-3 is sialic acid 4 , and RSV G may bind to heparan sulfate 5, 6 . The F glycoprotein mediates at least two essential steps in the virus life cycle that require membrane fusion: it promotes fusion of the viral and cellular membranes with subsequent transfer of viral genome material into the cell, and promotes fusion of the infected cell membrane with those of adjacent cell membranes, leading to syncytia formation. The F glycoproteins of RSV and PIV-3 are synthesized as inactive precursors, which are co-translationally modified by the addition of N-linked glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum. The F precursor is cleaved by cellular trypsin-like endoproteases into two disulfide-linked subunits, F1 and F2, before reaching the cell surface, and is assembled as a higher-order homooligomer 7, 8 . RSV can infect cells in vitro despite lacking the G glycoprotein 9 , indicating that F may have additional functions of attachment to a host coreceptor.",

There was inhibition of cell-to-cell spread and syncytia formation in rgRSV-infected cells treated with the RhoA 77-95 peptide compared with that of untreated, infected cells. The number of infected cells increased between 4 and 24 hours after infection, indicating the completion of one round of viral replication, production of new virions and infection of new cells before 24 hours.

We used RhoA without the peptide as a positive control. As a negative control, we used Rac1 protein and RhoA 87-105 instead of RhoA and RhoA 77-95 , respectively. There was a correlation between concentration of RhoA 77-95 peptide and inhibition of RhoA interaction with F. The results for all concentrations of RhoA 87-105 were similar to data from the untreated positive control, whereas the results for Rac1 binding to F were similar to background values. These data indicate that the biologic effects demonstrated with the peptide in cell culture and in vivo are based on its inhibition of the interaction between RhoA and the viral fusion protein. c d e f ARTICLES Next, we determined whether the binding of RhoA 77-95 peptide to F was reversible or nonreversible in the ELISA. We added RhoA protein 1 hour after allowing RhoA 77-95 peptide to bind F protein, incubated this for 1 hour, and detected RhoA using monoclonal antibodies against RhoA.

The fusion glycoprotein (F) mediates virus-induced fusion at neutral pH, and for PIV-3, membrane fusion depends on the density of the fusion protein on the infected cell surface 19 . Cellular proteins contributing to paramyxovirus-induced syncytia formation have not been identified before. However, the lipid composition and other properties of the target cell membrane can influence the ability of a virus to produce syncytia 20, 21 . A host protein, RhoA, has been shown to bind to viral fusion glycoprotein and facilitates syncytium formation 14 . We have shown here the inhibition of RSVand PIV-3-induced syncytium formation by a RhoA-derived peptide (RhoA 77-95 ) from the RSV F binding domain. This inhibition indicates that two viruses from the Paramyxoviridae family may use the same host cell protein and same binding site on this protein in the process of inducing cell-to-cell fusion, strengthening the concept of conserved functional and structural features of paramyxovirus fusion proteins. The role of RhoA in virus-induced fusion is not yet defined and might include a direct effect, or an indirect effect through signaling events on cellular cytoskeletal organization, cell shape or cell motility. The F protein interaction with RhoA might also be involved in other aspects Peptides derived from the heptad repeat region of viral fusion protein [22] [23] [24] [25] inhibit syncytium formation by homologous virus by binding to the heptad repeats interfering with fusion protein structure. The inhibitory peptide described here is of a different nature. We have shown here that a peptide derived from a cellular protein that does not have sequence homology to the viral fusion proteins can specifically inhibit virus-induced syncytium formation and possibly virus entry. In a yeast two-hybrid assay, RhoA was shown to not bind a RSV F construct expressing the heptad repeat region of the fusion proteins (F N155 construct encoding F residues 155-550)(ref. 14) , indicating that the mechanism of fusion inhibition by the RhoA-derived peptide is different from that for peptides interfering with the heptad repeat interactions.",

The inhibitory effect of RhoA 77-95 in vivo on virus replication and potential for diminishing illness in the mouse model of RSV (Fig.  5) indicate that early treatment with a RhoA-derived peptide has therapeutic potential in RSV or PIV-3 infections, particularly in giant cell pneumonia, seen in patients with bone marrow trans- b c ARTICLES plantation, lung transplantation or severe combined immunodeficiency. Although the peptide treatment immediately before or 2 hours after RSV infection prevented illness in mice, treatment on day 4 after RSV infection had no effect on the illness (data not shown).

The ability of the RhoA 77-95 peptide to inhibit RSV F-induced cell-to-cell fusion was assessed using a quantitative assay based on the cytoplasmic activation of reporter gene \u03b2-galactosidase 16 . One population of HEp-2 cells was infected with recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3, which encodes T7 polymerase, at a multiplicity of infection of 10 PFU per cell, and was transfected with plasmids encoding RSV glycoproteins F, G and SH under control of the T7 promoter (gifts from P. Collins, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies). At 5 h after transfection, the cells expressing viral envelope proteins were trypsinized, suspended in MEM containing 2.5% FBS to a density of 2 \u00d7 10 7 cells per ml, and incubated overnight at 32 \u00b0C. The cells were then washed and suspended in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) at a concentration of 1 x 10 6 cells per ml. A second population of HEp-2 cells was infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing \u03b2-galactosidase under control of the T7 promoter (provided by E.A. Berger, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland). At 5 h after infection, cells were trypsinized and finally suspended at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells per ml. The cell population expressing the viral glycoproteins was treated with 5 \u00b5g/ml RhoA 77-95 or RhoA 87-105 peptide or left untreated, and incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. The two cell populations were mixed in triplicate by adding 100 \u00b5l of each cell population to 96-well tissue culture plates, which were then incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h. Cell fusion was measured by the quantitative colorimetric lysate assay for \u03b2-galactosidase or an in situ assay using X-Gal (5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl \u03b2-D-galactopyranoside; Life Technologies) staining of cells. In the colorimetric lysate assay, 5 \u00b5l 20% (volume/volume) Nonidet-P40 was added to each well, and the contents were mixed by pipetting. \u03b2-galactosidase activity was quantified at ambient temperature in 96-well flat-bottomed plates by mixing 50 \u00b5l of each lysate with 50 \u00b5l 2X substrate solution The rate of substrate hydrolysis at ambient temperature was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 590 nm with a spectrophotometer. The quantity of \u03b2-galactosidase was calculated by comparing the hydrolysis rates for each sample with that obtained for a standard commercial preparation of Escherichia coli \u03b2-galactosidase (600 U/mg; Boehringer). \u03b2-galactosidase levels were expressed as nanograms per well. For the in situ assay, 20 \u00b5l 10X fixative solution (20% formaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS) was added to each well. The plates were incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min. Without disturbing the settled cells, 0.15 ml medium was gently removed and replaced with 0.15 ml of 37 \u00b0Cequilibrated staining solution (5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mM magnesium chloride and 1 mg/ml X-Gal, freshly diluted from a 40 mg/ml stock solution in dimethyl formamide). The plates were incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C to allow complete staining. Blue-stained syncytia were viewed with an inverted phase-contrast microscope.",
