Interactions between SADS-CoV and the host innate immune response is unclear yet. In this study, we used IPEC-J2 cells as a model to explore potential evasion strategies employed by SADS-CoV. Our results showed that SADS-CoV infection failed to induce IFN-\u03b2 production, and inhibited poly (I:C) and Sendai virus (SeV)-triggered IFN-\u03b2 expression. SADS-CoV also blocked poly (I:C)-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB. Furthermore, SADS-CoV did not interfere with the activity of IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulated by IRF3, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, but counteracted its activation induced by IPS-1 and RIG-I. Collectively, this study is the first investigation that shows interactions between SADS-CoV and the host innate immunity, which provides information of the molecular mechanisms underlying SASD-CoV infection.",

As a newly emerged coronavirus, recent researches of SADS-CoV have been mainly focused on clinical diagnosis, molecular epidemiology, evolution and animal models (Fu et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018a, b; Xu et al., 2019) .

In the early stage of infection, host cells can recognize some conservative components of the virus, i.e. pathogen-associated molecular patterns, through pattern recognition receptors including Toll-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors. Following recognition, specific signal pathways of these receptors are activated to induce expressions of type I interferons. Then the type I interferon binds to its receptor to activate downstream JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway, which ultimately produces a series of interferon-stimulating factors that can inhibit the virus proliferation (Kawai and Akira, 2006; Carlos et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010) . For most RNA viruses, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is the replicative intermediate, which is mainly recognized by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiationassociated gene 5 (MDA5) (Andrejeva et al., 2004; Cao et al., 2015) .",

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) interacted with IPS-1 to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 transcription in porcine small intestinal epithelial cells (Cao et al., 2015) . Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) suppressed IFN-\u03b2 production by blocking the activation of transcription factors IRF3 and NF-\u03baB in a porcine kidney cell line, LLC-PK1 cells (Luo et al., 2016) . Although Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection didn't suppress IFN-\u03b2 induction, it induced a delayed activation of the IFN response in IPEC-J2 cells (Zhu et al., 2017a) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) interfered with IRF-3 function to prevent activation of the innate immune system in VeroE6 and human 293 cells (Spiegel et al., 2005) . Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) employed unique strategies to circumvent the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response at multiple steps, such as causing an inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production at a posttranscriptional level (Roth-Cross et al., 2007) . Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) suppressed production of IFN\u03b2 by interfering with the IPS-I activation in the RIG-I signaling pathway (Luo et al., 2008) . Compared with these knowledge, there is an urgent need to revel evasion strategies employed by SADS-CoV infection to provide meaningful information for virus control.",

Infected cells were monitored by IFAs using a polyclonal antibody against SADS-CoV N protein at 12, 24, 36, 48 hpi. As shown in Fig. 1A , only a small number of fluorescent signals were detected at 12 hpi. While at 24 hpi, more cells with obviously cytopathic effects were detected positive for SADS-CoV, indicating that viruses began to proliferate rapidly in IPEC-J2 cells. Along with cell detachment occurring, fluorescence signals began to weaken at 36 hpi. No obvious proliferation of SADS-CoV was detected after 48 hpi due to a large number of monolayer cells exfoliation. As the same time, the genome copies of SADS-CoV were detected by the TaqMan-based real-time qPCR assay. The results showed that the number of genome copies exhibited a gradually upward tendency before 12 hpi, and increased rapidly after 12 hpi. At 36 hpi, the number of SADS-CoV genome copies reached the highest level and then decreased after 36 hpi. Congruent with the result of qPCR, the western blot analysis of SADS-CoV N protein also showed that the level of N protein increased with the time of infection. And at 36 hpi, the amount of N protein reached the highest level, and same with that at 48 hpi (Fig.1) . Taken together, SADS-CoV infection in IPEC-J2 cells gained the high genomic copies without cell detachment at 24 hpi, which provided a reference for in vitro studies of SADS-CoV infection.",

As shown in Fig. 2A , the mRNA expression of IFN-\u03b2 was hardly detected at all indicated time points in SADS-CoV-infected cells, while the poly (I:C)-transfected cells used as the positive control presented remarkable expressions of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA, especially on 9 hpi and 12 hpi. Similarly, another positive control SeV also induced the mRNA expression of IFN\u03b2 in mock-infected cells infected with SeV. However, in SADS-CoV infected cells, the IFN-\u03b2 mRNA mediated by SeV was obviously inhibited (Fig. 2B) . For the IFN-\u03b2 promoter luciferase activity analysis, IPEC-J2 cells were first transfected with the luciferase reporter system including the IFN-\u03b2-Luc luciferase reporter plasmids and the internal control plasmid pRL-TK, then followed by infection with SADS-CoV (MOI = 0.1; MOI = 1), mock-infection, and poly (I:C) (1 \u03bcg/well), respectively. Similar to the result of the IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression, the IFN\u03b2 luciferase activity was also barely detectable in SADS-CoV infected IPEC-J2 cells compared with the strong signal in cells transfected with poly (I:C) (Fig. 2C) . To further identify whether SADS-CoV can inhibit poly (I:C)-or SeV induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity, IPEC-J2 cells were co-transfected with IFN-\u03b2-Luc and pRL-TK, then infected by SADS-CoV (MOI = 1) or mock infected for 12 h, and finally either transfected with or without poly (I:C), or infected or mock infected by SeV for addition 12 h. As shown in Fig. 2D , the activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter induced by poly(I:C) was obviously blocked in SADS-CoV-infected cells compared with mock-infected cells transfected with poly(I:C). Similar to Fig. 2D , SeV infection also significantly increased the activity of IFN-\u03b2 promoter. While in SADS-CoV-infected cells, IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity induced by SeV was inhibited by the virus (Fig. 2E) . The protein expression of IFN-\u03b2 was also detected. Congruent with the mRNA and the promoter activity of IFN-\u03b2, the protein expression induced by SeV was also inhibited by SADS-CoV (Fig. 2 F) . Taken together, these results indicated that SADS-CoV infection failed to activate IFN-\u03b2 production and inhibited poly (I:C) or SeV-triggered IFN-\u03b2 activity.",

Compared with the amount of p-IRF-3 and p-NF-\u03baB detected in poly (I:C) transfected cells, p-IRF-3 and p-NF-\u03baB showed a very low level of expression in SADS-CoV infected cells, and the expression of these two molecules mediated by poly (I:C) were obviously inhibited by SADS-CoV infection. The relative luciferase activities of IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB were also measured. As shown in Fig. 3B , compared with the luciferase promoter activity in mock-infected cells, a little decrease of IRF3 activity and no change of NF-\u03baB activity were observed in SADS-CoV inoculated cells. Both IRF3 and NF-\u03baB activity Z. Zhou, et al. Virus Research 278 (2020) 197843 induced by poly (I:C) were obviously inhibited by SADS-CoV infection.

The result showed that in SADS-CoV-infected cells, IPS-1mediated IFN-\u03b2 luciferase activity (1.87-fold) was lower than that in mock-infected cells (3.22-fold) (Fig. 5A) , which was obviously different from the effect of TBK and IKK\u03b5.

To confirm this speculation, mock infected or SADS-CoV-infected IPEC-J2 were transfected with RIG-I over-expression plasmid as well as the IFN-\u03b2 promoter luciferase reporter plasmid.

Thus, these important molecules are aimed by coronaviruses with different mechanisms to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 production. For instance, through blocking the IRF3 Fig. 1 .

Virus Research 278 (2020) 197843 phosphorylation by the membrane protein, the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) could suppress the type I interferon expression (Lui et al., 2016) . The nonstructural protein (NSP) 5 encoded by PDCoV inhibited IFN-\u03b2 production through the cleavage of NEMO, which was responsible for the recruitment of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 and the activation of IKK complex (Zhu et al., 2017b) . In our study, the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 were interrupted by SADS-CoV infection, but IRF3, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 over-expression increased the IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity in SADS-CoV inoculated cells, which indicated that SADS-CoV didn't target these signal molecules. Activating TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 needs interactions between IPS-1 and RIG-I, so we further investigated the roles of IPS-1 and RIG-I in SADS-CoV infections. The results showed that contrary to the enhance of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity induced by TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, the IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity associated with IPS-1 and RIG-I over-expression was blocked by SADS-CoV infection. This suggested that SADS-CoV may target IPS-1 to block IFN-\u03b2 production. PEDV and PRRSV also interfered with IPS-1 activation to inhibit the production of IFN-\u03b2 (Luo et al., 2008; Cao et al., 2015) . RIG-I is also the aim for many coronaviruses.
