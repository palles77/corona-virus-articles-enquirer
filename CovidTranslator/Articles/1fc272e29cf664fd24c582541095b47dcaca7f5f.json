            "text": "Conventional influenza vaccines need to be designed and manufactured yearly. However, they occasionally provide poor protection owing to antigenic mismatch. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop universal vaccines against influenza virus. Using nucleoprotein (NP) and extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) genes from the influenza A virus A/Beijing/30/95 (H3N2), we constructed four recombinant vaccinia virus-based influenza vaccines carrying NP fused with one or four copies of M2e genes in different orders. The recombinant vaccinia viruses were used to immunize BALB/C mice. Humoral and cellular responses were measured, and then the immunized mice were challenged with the influenza A virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8). NP-specific humoral response was elicited in mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying full-length NP, while robust M2e-specific humoral response was elicited only in the mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying multiple copies of M2e. All recombinant viruses elicited NP-and M2e-specific cellular immune responses in mice. Only immunization with RVJ-4M2eNP induced remarkably higher levels of IL-2 and IL-10 cytokines specific to M2e. Furthermore, RVJ-4M2eNP immunization provided the highest cross-protection in mice challenged with 20 MLD 50 of PR8. Therefore, the cross-protection potentially correlates with both NP and M2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses induced by RVJ-4M2eNP, which expresses a fusion antigen of full-length NP preceded by four M2e repeats. These results suggest that the rational fusion of NP and multiple M2e antigens is critical toward inducing protective immune responses, and the 4M2eNP fusion antigen may be employed to develop a universal influenza vaccine.",

            "text": "Seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infectious disease that can cause serious health problems. Seasonal influenza epidemics caused by influenza A and B viruses result in 3-5 million severe cases and 290,000-650,000 deaths worldwide; 5%-10% of adults and 20%-30% of children suffer from flu annually (World Health Organization, WHO 2019). Seasonal influenza viruses undergo antigenic drift, which makes the conventional seasonal vaccines ineffective when the vaccine strains mismatch with the epidemic strains. Therefore, seasonal influenza vaccines must be updated regularly for effective prevention of influenza. The production time for conventional influenza vaccines can be lengthy. It takes 1-2 months to obtain vaccine strains using conventional reassortment technology or reverse genetics technology, followed by several more months for large-scale expansion of influenza vaccine using an ample supply of specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos. Generally, influenza vaccine production takes 3-6 months from the prediction of the epidemic strain to the ultimate production of the vaccine (Emanuel and Wertheimer 2006) . For more effective prevention of influenza, new vaccines are warranted to induce crossprotection and long-lasting immune responses (Erbelding Electronic (NP) and extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) can induce cross-protection against influenza A virus, showing promise as candidate antigens for the development of a broad-spectrum influenza vaccine (Erbelding et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2015; Kui et al. 2015) . Previously, we expressed a fusion protein of NP and M2e (NM2e) in Escherichia coli and showed that immunization with NM2e formulated with aluminum hydroxide gel protected mice from a lethal challenge with heterologous influenza virus . Therefore, vaccination with recombinant NM2e fusion protein is a promising strategy for the development of a universal influenza vaccine. However, a new expression system is required to further optimize the NP-and M2e-based vaccine. The vaccinia virus (Tiantan strain) was developed in China as a vaccination agent against smallpox, as documented by WHO (Fenner et al. 1988 ). This strain was used to inoculate several individuals for *50 years, playing a key role in the eradication of smallpox in China (Ruan 2013) . The Tiantan strain has favorable gene vector and vaccine characteristics, including a powerful multiplication capacity, wide host range, high capacity for insertion of a foreign gene, noncarcinogenicity, and induction of longlasting immunity. Using the TK gene system of the Tiantan strain, this vaccinia virus has been developed successfully as a viral vector for various vaccine applications (Ruan 2013) , and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccines (Yan et al. 2009 ). We have developed recombinant vaccinia viruses based on NP, M1, M2, and PB1 of influenza A virus Wang et al. 2007 Wang et al. , 2015 . Several of our NP-based recombinant vaccinia viruses have induced a protective immune response in BALB/c mice. To develop a vaccine with broader protection, we constructed recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing various combinations of NP and M2e to exhibit their maximal antigenicity. BALB/c mice were immunized with the recombinant viruses to measure NP-and M2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses as well as protective effect against lethal challenge with a heterologous influenza virus.",

The vaccinia virus DNA was extracted to amplify the target gene fragments using PCR. The inserted target genes were confirmed by sequencing of the PCR products.",

In the present study, a single M2e induced a poor M2e-specific humoral response (Fig. 3A , RVJ-NPM2e, RVJ-M2eNP). Four tandem repeats of M2e induced robust antibody response against M2e (Fig. 3A , RVJ-4M2eNP, RVJ-4M2eNPs), leading to a much stronger cross-protection than that of other groups against heterosubtypic H1N1 influenza virus challenge (Fig. 4B , RVJ-4M2eNP, RVJ-4M2eNPs). It had been proved that more robust M2especific immune response can be induced with multiple copies of M2e (Zhang et al. 2011; Zhao et al. 2010b; Zhou et al. 2012) , and further enhanced by fusion with an appropriate protein carrier (Ma et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2010a; Ebrahimi et al. 2012; Alvarez et al. 2013; Schotsaert et al. 2009 ). Our data suggest that M2e-specific antibody and cellular response played important roles in protection, and 4 9 M2e is more favorable than 1 9 M2e to induce protective immune response. M2e specific antibody may play a protective role by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), although it could not neutralize influenza virus (Kim et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2015) . Besides, M2e specific cellular immune response may stimulate CD4? T cells to protect animals (Adlermoore et al. 2011).",

In the present study, a truncated NP protein lacking 50 amino acids at the N terminal and * 70 amino acids at the C terminal was designated as NPs. Although NPs retaining the middle part of NP with multiple conserved epitopes, it showed weaker immunogenicity compared with full-length NP (Fig. 3A , RVJ-4M2eNP, RVJ-4M2eNPs), and less protection in this experiment (Fig. 4B , RVJ-4M2eNP vs RVJ-4M2eNPs, P \\ 0.01), probably because of less NP expression (Fig. 2, middle  panel) , suggesting that full-length NP is critical toward inducing protective immunity at least in BALB/c mouse. Previous research proved that human MAb against influenza NP played an important role in fighting low-dose infection of influenza virus (Fujimoto et al. 2016) , and NP might exert a protective effect through ADCC (Kui et al. (Hayward et al. 2015) . The present study showed that NPspecific antibody and cellular response played important roles in protection. NP-specific antibody could not neutralize influenza virus just as M2e. However, it may protect animals against challenge by ADCC, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, or antibody-dependent complement deposition, and NP cellular immune response may stimulate CD4? and CD8? T cells for protection (Guo et al. 2010; LaMere et al. 2011) ; the related mechanism is worthy of further investigation. Humoral and cellular immune responses in BALB/c mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses. Mice were immunized intramuscularly with 10 7 plaque-forming units of recombinant vaccinia viruses at weeks 0 and 4. Group 1 (G1) mice immunized with RVJ1175 were served as negative controls. A Serum was obtained from three mice at 10 days post the second immunization and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for the presence of IgG antibodies specific for NP (left) or M2e (right), as described in ''Materials and methods''.

B, C Cellular immune response in mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses. Cytokines secreted from stimulated spleen mononuclear cells (SMNCs) were measured by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay (B) and mouse Th1/Th2/Th17 CBA kit (C). All mice in each treatment group were sacrificed at 10 days post the second immunization. SMNCs were separated from mouse spleen samples, and 5 lg/mL NP55-69 (left B), NP147-155 (middle B), and M2e pooled peptides (right B, and C) were used as stimulants in the ELISPOT and CBA assays. After stimulation for 24 h, the numbers of SMNCs producing interferon (IFN)-c (B) are presented as spotforming cells (SFCs)/10 6 SMNCs. The columns show the average SFCs/10 6 SMNCs, and the bars indicate the standard deviation of each group.

Our data showed that RVJ-NPM2e and RVJ-M2eNP induced similar antigen-specific IgG response (Fig. 3A , RVJ-NPM2e vs RVJ-M2eNP). However, RVJ-M2eNP induced significantly more NP147-155-as well as M2e-specific SFCs than the former one (Fig. 3B , RVJ-NPM2e vs RVJ-M2eNP), suggesting that M2e at N terminal of the fusion antigen is a favorable configuration to induce NP-and M2e-specific cellular immunity. Moreover, our data indicated that four copies of M2e preceding NP (4M2e-NP) is more robust toward inducing NP-and M2especific humoral immune response (Fig. 3A , RVJ-M2eNP vs RVJ-4M2eNP) and protection (Fig. 4B , RVJ-M2eNP vs RVJ-4M2eNP). In addition, we observed that only RVJ-4M2eNP immunization induced significantly higher levels of IL-2 and IL-10 cytokines in mice when stimulation with the M2e pooled peptides (Fig. 3C, RVJ-M2eNP ).",

Vaccinia virus Tiantan strain, developed in China as a vaccine against smallpox, has also been used as viral vector in numerous studies to develop recombinant viral vaccines. In this study, the vaccinia virus Tiantan strain was used to construct recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing fusion antigens with different configurations. The recombinant vaccinia virus expressing 4M2e and full-length NP fusion antigen induced strong cross-protection (92%) against a lethal heterosubtypic PR8 challenge at 20 MLD 50 and thus regarded as the optimal one among the four constructs. In the previous study, we expressed the fusion protein NM2e in an E. coli system, and determined its immunogenicity in BALB/c mice. However, it is inconvenient and time consuming to express and purify much more alternatives. Moreover, it is impossible to express target antigens in an E. coli system successfully sometimes. Compared with an E. coli system, the recombinant vaccinia virus system has characteristics such as high multiplication capacity, no requirement to purify proteins, and high-efficiency to determine the immunogenicity of target antigens in animal models (Coughlan et al. 2018; Mullin et al. 2016) . In fact, we succeeded in constructing and determining the antigenicity of several fusion antigens of NP and M2e efficiently.",

We concluded that the cross-protection potential correlates with both NP and M2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses induced by RVJ-4M2eNP. However, the recombinant RVJ-4M2eNP containing 4 9 M2e and full-length NP could not induce significant neutralizing antibodies, which help to reduce the severity and duration of the illness. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce conserved B-cell epitopes of HA to induce an enhanced cross-neutralizing response and protective potency (Koday et al. 2017) . Future studies should focus on the development of universal influenza Mice were monitored daily for 21 days after PR8 challenge. A Mice were weighed daily to monitor morbidity.
