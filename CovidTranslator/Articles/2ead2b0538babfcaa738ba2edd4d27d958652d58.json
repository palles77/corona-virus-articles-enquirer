The expressed VP2 was identified by expected molecular weight and immunoreactivity with anti-His monoclonal antibody in Western blotting assay. Serum samples collected from 455 individuals of all ages in Beijing without symptoms of ARI were tested for IgG antibodies against the affi nity-purifi ed recombinant VP2 protein by Western blotting to investigate the prevalence of natural WU virus infection. In addition, serum samples from four ARI pediatric patients, whose nasopharyngeal aspirates were positive for WU virus DNA and negative for all other respiratory-related viruses, were tested for IgM antibody against the recombinant VP2.",

The positive rate was the highest in serum samples from infants and children between 1 to 4 years of age. One of four ARI pediatric patients was positive for IgM against WU virus VP2, implicating WU virus as the causative disease agent. Conclusions: The high prevalence of IgG against WU polyomavirus in Beijing-based study population indicates that WU virus infection is common in Beijing. WU virus may be responsible for some pediatric ARI cases, and primary infection of this virus may occur mostly in childhood. World J Pediatr 2013;9(1):48-52",

Our findings have provided serological evidence of natural WU infection in adults and children from Beijing, China. To date, no specifi c antibody against WU virus has been available commercially. Since the pET30a (+) vector has a 6\u00d7His tag, the expression of recombinant WU virus VP2 was detected by an anti-His monoclonal antibody. Western blotting analysis indicated that the affinity-purified recombinant VP2 protein bound specifi cally to mouse anti-His monoclonal antibody. No immunoreactivity was detected in the mock controls.

No study has demonstrated the cross-reactivity of VP2s from WU virus and KI virus, probably because of the lack of a specific antibody. It has been reported, however, that the VP1s of WU virus and KI virus share 65% identity in amino acid sequences, yet previous competition assay and Western blotting revealed minimal, if any, detectable crossreactivity between the two viruses. [21, 22] The VP2s of WU virus and KI virus share 71% identity in amino acid sequences, and more work should be done to determine whether cross-reactivity exists among this structural protein from the two viruses.",

            "text": "To gain insights into the prevalence of WU virus infection in Beijing, serum antibodies against WU virus VP2 were examined by Western blot assays using recombinant VP2 as antigen. The high overall serum positive rate for IgG against WU virus VP2 (52.3%) suggests that infection by WU virus is common among the Beijing population. In the present study, the sero-positive rate of IgG antibodies against VP2 was 54.7% in the age group <18 years, and about 48.6% in the population \u226518 years. The positive rate in the age group <6 months was 51.2%, which was similar to that of adults (\u226518 years). It was suggested that IgG antibodies against WU virus VP2 in this age group may have been maternally transmitted. The sero-positive rate for WU virus VP2 decreased to a nadir in the next age group (6 months to <1 year), then steadily increased to a peak level (83.3%), and subsequently decreased and plateaued at less than 50%. These data implied that infection of WU virus was most prevalent in infants and children between 1 and 4 years of age and suggested that primary infection by WU virus occurred mainly in early childhood. Furthermore, this result was consistent with that from a previous study in our laboratory, in which serology data suggested that WU virus is a pathogen of ARI in children in Beijing. [14] Serum sample that was positive for IgM against WU virus VP2 was obtained from a 1-year-old boy. He was diagnosed with bronchial pneumonia on the 7th day after symptom onset, and his NPA was positive for WU virus DNA. Furthermore, the NPA was negative for common and other respiratory viruses, including RSV, InfA and B, PIV 1-3, ADVs, PIV4, HMPV, HRV, HBoV, and HCoV NL63, OC43, and 229E.
