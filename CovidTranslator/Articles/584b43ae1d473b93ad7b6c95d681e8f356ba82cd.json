We approached the 20 highest impact nephrology journals regarding their policy towards the use of preprint servers. We evaluated the average time from study completion to publication of impactful articles in nephrology. Finally, we evaluated the number of nephrology articles submitted to preprint servers. Findings: To date over 600 kidney--related articles have been uploaded to bioRxiv and medRxiv. The average time from study completion to publication was over 10 months. 16 of the top 20 nephrology journals currently accept research submitted to a preprint server. Transparency and collaboration, visibility and recognition, and rapid dissemination of results were identified as benefits of preprint servers. Concerns exist regarding the potential risk of non--peer reviewed medical research being publicly available. Limitations: Preprint servers remain a recent phenomenon in health sciences and their long-term impact on the medical literature remains to be seen. Implications: The quantity of research submitted to preprint servers is likely to continue to grow. The model for dissemination of research results will need to adapt to incorporate preprint servers.",

Preprint servers present an option for public posting of pre--peer reviewed manuscripts with the goal of establishing a public record of novel ideas, improving the quality of the manuscript before journal submission, and improving the rapidity of research dissemination.

BioRxiv is a free online preprint server in the life sciences founded in 2013, which hosts over 75,000 preprints as of March 2020. Access to the server is growing exponentially: there were over 2.2 million preprint downloads for October and November 2018, which is more than the cumulative total of downloads during its first 2.5 years of operation 4 . More than 170 journals have partnered with bioRxiv to create a streamlined submission process called \"B2J\", where manuscripts can be directly transferred to the peer--reviewed journals at the time of preprint upload 5,6 .",

MedRxiv is a medicine--specific preprint repository launched in June 2019. Its stated goals are to \"improve the openness and accessibility of scientific findings, enhance collaboration among researchers, document the provenance of ideas, and inform ongoing and planned research through more timely reporting of completed research\" 12 . However, concerns about possible dangers of early public access to non--peer reviewed medical research remain 13,14 . Preprints are beginning to provide a means for timely discussion of medical research, complementary to other non--peer reviewed modalities such as conference presentations and educational blog posts. With one of the most interactive and engaged online medical communities 15, 16 , the field of nephrology could have a large influence on the uptake of preprints in medicine. This rapid review will evaluate potential risks and benefits associated with preprint server use from the author, reader, journal and granting agency perspective and evaluate the current state of preprint server utilization in nephrology.",

There is a significant lag between study completion and publication, and results are often informally available at conference proceedings long before formal publication. Speed of research dissemination can be of great importance, especially in the context of outbreak science. The traditional model of peer review is evolving to promote transparency and equity of the scientific publication process. In medicine, safety concerns exist regarding making scientific results publically available prior to traditional peer review. Overall, with appropriate safeguards in place it appears that benefits of preprint servers outweigh the risks, and their use is likely to continue to grow.",
