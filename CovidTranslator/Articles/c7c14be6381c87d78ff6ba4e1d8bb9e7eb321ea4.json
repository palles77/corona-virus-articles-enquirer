The steady increase in European tourists, as well as soldiers serving on peacekeeping duties, in endemic areas, coupled with the present resurgence of dengue, raises the risk of exposure for a large number of European travellers. Significant numbers of travellers have, in fact, developed DF. There is a risk of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) in travellers who revisit the same place, and they have the potential not only to acquire, but also to spread, the dengue viral infection. Of concern is the potential for a dengue outbreak in a previously dengue-free country through imported cases. Another major concern is the potential area of dengue transmission, due to spread of its vectors through sizeable parts of southern Europe. In addition to the risk of haemorrhagic fever in returning tourists, the introduction of DF by returning travellers, whether they have symptoms or are unaffected by signs and symptoms of the disease, poses a threat to health systems in Europe.",

DF is endemic in most countries of Southern and Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific regions, Central and South America, the Caribbean and Africa (Fig. 1) . The incidence of epidemic and endemic dengue has increased substantially, notably in the Americas, since 1977 and various epidemics have occurred [4] [5] [6] . In Latin America, DHF was a rare disease before 1981. The 1980s and 1990s saw a dramatic geographic expansion of epidemic DF and DHF from Southeast Asia to the South Pacific Islands, the Caribbean and Latin America, with regions changing from non-endemic to hypo-endemic or hyperendemic [3] . Many of these endemic areas are popular tourist destinations. The steadily increasing number of tourists visiting endemic areas, coupled with the present resurgence of dengue, has raised the risk of exposure for large number of travellers [7] . DF is also an emerging problem for troops deployed in dengue-endemic tropical countries [8] .",

Humans are the main reservoir for the dengue virus, although non-human primates in Asia and Africa may also be infected [3] . Four distinct serotypes are recognized: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4. Infection with any of these viruses may be asymptomatic, may cause self-limited febrile illness known as DF or, in a small percentage of cases, may result in a life-threatening syndrome, the so-called DHF/DSS [11] . Infection with one serotype provides lifelong homologous immunity but only transient cross-protection against other serotypes, thus allowing a sequential infection with possible progression to DHF/DSS. The pathogenesis of DHF/DSS is only partially understood. Today, the majority view is that antibody- dependent viral infection enhancement is the main mechanism responsible for inducing DHF/DSS associated with secondary dengue virus infection [11, 12] .",

The quality of both studies suffered from the retrospective design and a considerable lack of data on living standards, housing conditions and travelling habits of these patients.

This is mainly because of a lack of effective preventive measures, the high attack rate, the high symptomatic/unapparent infection ratio and the long period that one is unfit for duty after the acute phase of the disease. In a study carried out on Italian troops deployed in East Timor from 1999 to 2000, 6.6% of army soldiers contracted probable DF; there were no probable DF cases detected in low-exposure groups, such as navy and air force personnel. Approximately 60% of the troops with supportive serological evidence of recent dengue infection showed the clinical manifestations of classic DF, 20% had milder symptoms and 20% were asymptomatic [8] . The U.S. troops deployed in Somalia in 1993 showed features of classical DF in more than 85% of patients [46] . Performing duties outside the camp was associated with a high risk of infection, probably because vector control activities were regularly carried out only within the compound. The only measure taken for personnel protection was the use of bed nets. However, most of the soldiers were on duty at night and thus slept during the day, when the biting activity of the dengue vector is highest [8] . Moreover, previously infected soldiers redeployed to endemic areas may be at an increased risk of DHF/DSS complications. Therefore, it was suggested that this risk should be taken into account when planning international peacekeeping operations and that the risk of DHF among previously dengue-infected military personnel should be evaluated beforehand [8] .",

Also, it was shown that the most meaningful laboratory results were marked leucopenia (72%), thrombocytopenia (70-89%), hyponatremia (41%) and increase hepatic enzymes (45-60%). Fourteen percent had haemorrhagic phenomena. The median duration of fever was 6 days (range 1-11 days) [20] .

Therefore, some travellers with symptoms of acute viral fever in whom malaria has been excluded may not come back after they have recovered [20, 22] . Another reason for underestimation of DF among European travellers is that few centres use standardised diagnostic procedures for febrile patients. In addition, DF is currently not reported in most European public health systems [15] . Therefore, the voluntarily reported cases in Europe still represent the tip of the iceberg.",

In Spain, which is considered a non-infected area, several surveys based on non-specific haemmaglutination inhibition assay have shown a seroprevalence of Flaviviruses including dengue virus [50] . Another major concern is the potential area of dengue transmission due to the spread of its vectors, notably in sizable parts of the United States and Europe. Thus, the introduction of DF by returning travellers to those not afflicted with the disease poses a very real threat to the public health systems of the western world. One of the largest DF epidemics known in history, involving approximately one million cases and 1000 deaths, occurred in 1927-1928 in Greece. At that time, the vector was the later eradicated A. aegypti. In this context, the recent introduction of A. albopictus to Europe, notably Italy and Albania, may serve as a warning of things to come [1] .",

Imported dengue in non-immune travellers usually takes a favourable course, but the global expansion of dengue virus and increased international travel have intensified the possibility of sequential infections and the risk of developing DHF and DSS [20] . Nevertheless, DHF and DSS are rare in travellers. Those with a history of dengue should be advised to protect themselves well from mosquitoes when travelling to endemic areas [51] .
