As expected, the best protocol to use in a virtual-screening project is highly dependent on the target receptor being studied. However, the mean screening performance obtained when candidate ligands are docked with Vina and rescored with NNScore 1.0 is not statistically different than the mean performance obtained when docking and scoring with Glide. We further demonstrate that the Vina and NNScore docking scores both correlate with chemical properties like small-molecule size and polarizability. Compensating for these potential biases leads to improvements in virtual screen performance. Composite NNScore-based scoring functions suited to a specific receptor further improve performance. We are hopeful that the current study will prove useful for those interested in computer-aided drug design.",

These programs position three-dimensional models of small molecules into models of target binding pockets; associated scoring functions subsequently predict the binding affinities of these \"posed\" candidate ligands. While certainly useful as an enrichment tool, docking has not yet reached its full potential. In part, the inaccuracies inherent in this technique stem from factors that are independent of the scoring function itself. For example, most docking programs do not account for full receptor flexibility, despite the fact that flexibility plays a critical role in modern theories of smallmolecule binding (e.g., induced-fit 7, 8 and population-shift 9\u221212 models). Indeed, efforts to account for receptor flexibility have proven effective and have led to the identification of a number of experimentally validated ligands. 8, 13, 14 Similarly, most docking programs do not account for binding-pocket water molecules, which can in some cases play critical roles in mediating receptor\u2212ligand interactions. 15 Even a \"perfect\" docking program would fail to identify true ligands when presented with sterically incompatible binding-pocket conformations and/or pockets devoid of crucial water molecules.",

Biological neurons and synapses are simulated in silico as \"neurodes\" and \"connections.\" Data to be analyzed is encoded on an input layer of neurodes, triggering a cascade of signals that propagates through the network. Both the organization and number of the neurodes as well as the weights (i.e., strengths) assigned to each neurode\u2212neurode connection serve to modify the initial input signal during propagation. The cascade eventually reaches an output layer of artificial neurons, where an analysis of the original input signal is ultimately encoded.",

For NNScore 1.0, these descriptors included the number of protein\u2212ligand close contacts, categorized by AutoDock atom types; the electrostatic energy of those close contacts; the number of ligand atoms of each atom type; and the number of ligand rotatable bonds. For NNScore 2.0, the input additionally included the descriptors provided by the BINANA algorithm 20 (counts of the number of hydrophobic, \u03c0\u2212\u03c0, hydrogen-bond, and salt-bridge interactions), as well as the components of the Vina scoring function (steric, hydrophobic, hydrogen-bond, and ligand-rotatablebond terms). 21 While some efforts have been made to demonstrate the favorable performance of these neural-network scoring functions, these efforts focused on a limited number of systems, and the neural-network functions were not directly compared to top-tier proprietary docking programs like Schrodinger's Glide. 22\u221225 In the current work, we use AutoDock Vina 21 and Glide 26, 27 to dock the diverse compounds of the NCI diversity set III, a popular compound library available through the National Cancer Institute (NCI), into the 40 protein receptors of the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD). 28 Additionally, Vina-and Glide-docked poses are reevaluated using NNScore 1.0 and 2.0. The mean screening performance obtained when candidate ligands are docked with Vina and rescored with NNScore 1.0 is not statistically different than the mean performance obtained when docking and scoring with Glide. This is particularly noteworthy given that Glide, while state of the art, is expensive and has a restrictive token system. In contrast, AutoDock Vina and NNScore 1.0 are both free and open source.",

Such a scoring function would be inappropriately penalized because its ability to utilize information about ligand rotatable bonds would be underexploited. Indeed, these types of concerns have lead others to use modified versions of the DUD decoy set. 42, 43 Of note, Vina includes one ligand-specific term in its scoring function (number of rotatable bonds), 21 and the NNScore functions include additional ligand-specific terms related to the number of ligand atom types. 18, 19 Consequently, while we believe convincing arguments can be made in favor of using the DUD decoys, in the current work, we opted to use the NCI compounds as decoys instead. A separate issue related to decoy selection must also be addressed. High-throughput screens typically have hit rates that range from 0.1% to 1.0%; 44\u221250 it is therefore reasonable to assume that for each DUD protein, the NCI set contains between 1 and 16 \"decoys\" that are in fact actives. A similar assumption underlies the set of DUD decoys, which have likewise not been explicitly tested to rule out binding. Possible inaccuracies in comparison metrics introduced by these kinds of assumptions are at least in part ameliorated by the fact that all the docking scoring protocols being compared are subject to the same assumption. Furthermore, the NCI set used in the current project may well have fewer true binders than the widely used DUD set, given that the DUD decoys were, as mentioned above, carefully chosen to be chemically similar to the DUD actives.",

Though speculative, we suspect two factors explain the favorable performance of Vina\u2212NN1. First, the additional features of molecular binding that NN2 explicitly considers may not provide additional information over what NN1 can infer implicitly. For example, in estimating binding affinity, NN2 explicitly considers the number \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking interactions; however, NN1 might be able to implicitly infer \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking by considering the number of receptor and ligand aromatic carbon atoms that are in close proximity. Second, NN1 and NN2 assess ligand potency very differently. NN1 is trained to return a binary response: good binder or poor binder. In contrast, NN2 is trained to return a range of scores roughly equivalent to pK i or pIC 50 values. It may be that binary classification is more Setting the specific details of virtual screens against individual proteins aside, the best way of assessing the global utility of a docking scoring function is to consider its performance over multiple diverse receptors. When the average area under the ROC curve calculated over all 40 DUD receptors was considered, Vina\u2212NN1 and Vina\u2212NN2 outperformed Vina\u2212 Vina and HTVS\u2212HTVS. To determine whether or not this difference was statistically significant, we used a technique called analysis of variance (ANOVA). 53 ANOVA asserts the null hypothesis that the means of multiple samples are equal (i.e., that multiple samples are drawn from populations with the same mean). In this sense, ANOVA is similar to the t-test, which is limited to two samples. When assessing multiple samples, one might be tempted to simply perform multiple ttests between all sample pairs; however, each t-test carries with it the risk of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e., committing a type I error by rejecting the conclusion that two samples have statistically equal means when in fact they are statistically equal). As more and more t-tests are performed, the chances of committing this error increase. ANOVA avoids the problem by considering multiple samples in conjunction rather than pairwise. Both ANOVA and the t-test allow one to assess the degree of statistical significance via a p value. The p value in this case represents the probability that the multiple samples could have means that differ to the degree observed or greater, given that the null hypothesis is true (i.e., given that the samples are drawn from populations with equal means). If p < 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected.",

It is therefore the initial portion of the ROC curve, some argue, that ought to be of primary interest. A number of performance metrics have been proposed to address this issue (e.g., the BEDROC metric 54 derived from a modified ROC curve that weights top-ranked compounds). Additionally, Hawkins et al. 36 recently suggested a simple approach using the \"metric of early performance based on the ROC curve.\" In this scheme, one analyzes a ROC curve to determine the true positive rate for a fixed false positive rate (5% in the current work).",

As expected, early performance Correlations between Molecular Properties and Docking Scores: Artifactual or Physical? In hopes of further improving virtual-screening accuracy, we next sought to specifically characterize scoring-function biases. Schrodinger's QikProp program was used to analyze the screened compounds (known inhibitors and putative decoys). A statistical correlation between certain chemical properties and the average rank of each compound across all 40 DUD receptors was noted. Vina\u2212 Vina, Vina\u2212NN1, and Vina\u2212NN2 scores tended to correlate with properties associated with molecular size (molecular weight, total solvent accessible surface area, volume, number of ring atoms, and number of heteroatoms) and polarizability (Table 3 ). It is interesting that both Vina and the neuralnetwork scoring functions demonstrated similar trends, even though they evaluate ligand binding using very different methodologies. Others have identified similar biases in the FlexX and Gold docking programs. 58 The HTVS\u2212HTVS and HTVS\u2212SP\u2212XP protocols did not exhibit these biases to the same extent (Table 3) . For the interested reader, we provide a real-world example of how scoring-function biases can affect screening results in the Supporting Information. These potentially artifactual correlations between ligand properties and docking scores may result in part from a general neglect of penalty terms that ought to be associated with binding (e.g., ligand desolvation, trapping binding-site waters, etc.). We do not mean to imply that Vina and NNScore neglect penalty terms entirely. The Vina scoring function, for example, has three steric-interaction terms. 21 Additionally, NNScore may be able to implicitly account for some penalty terms as well; information about energetically unfavorable buried polar groups, for example, could potentially be extracted from the pairwise receptor\u2212ligand atom-type information that NNScore considers. Nevertheless, both Vina and NNScore are likely \"blind\" to many important penalty phenomena. Indeed, Glidebased protocols may perform well relative to many other scoring functions 24 because they better account for these penalties, as evidenced by the fact that HTVS and XP scores are not strongly correlated with molecular weight (Table 3) . Future versions of NNScore currently being developed will consider three-dimensional descriptions of ligand\u2212receptor binding and so may be even more effective than current implementations.",

It would be possible to identify the actives using ligand-specific factors alone, independent of any important ligand\u2212receptor interactions.",

We therefore repeated the above scoring-function optimizations, now generating an independent composite scoring function for each receptor ( Figure 2B ).",

An analogous scoring function containing only ligand-specific terms was also generated, as above. Again, we rejected the null hypothesis that the mean performances of the ligand-specific scoring function and its parent function with the additional NN1 term were statistically equivalent (0.53 vs 0.68, p = 0.01). It is not necessarily our purpose to provide specific composite functions for others to use in their virtual screens; rather, we wish to demonstrate the general utility of deriving such functions when positive controls (known inhibitors) are available. A composite scoring function tailored to a specific receptor and designed to optimize the ranking of known inhibitors can potentially enhance virtual-screening performance.",
