Queens undergo estrous cycles repeatedly during a breeding season unless interrupted by pregnancy, pseudopregnancy, or illness. Estrous cycles will occur at variable intervals but most typically every 14 to 21 days. Cats housed indoors, but largely under the influence of seasonal light, will cycle according to the season. The mechanism of photoperiod influence on estrous cycles through the hypothalamichypophysial-gonadal axis and the hormone melatonin has been partly elucidated in the cat. A shorter duration of photoperiod is associated with increased concentrations of melatonin and prolactin and reduction in ovarian activity.",

Peak estrous activity is usually seen in the northern hemisphere from February to April. Regular estrous activity will continue until as late as October or November, depending on the geographic distance from the equator (and therefore the length of daylight). Most cats housed indoors in North America will experience winter anestrus because of the short length of daylight. The effect of seasonality diminishes or disappears near the equator. 12 Queens housed together may have synchronized estrous cycles. Longhair breeds seem to be more sensitive to the amount of daylight than shorthair breeds. Although many longhair queens (such as the Persian breed) will not exhibit regular estrous cycles even during periods of long daylight, many shorthair queens (such as Siamese and related breeds) exhibit estrous cycles year-round, regardless of daylight length. Inadequate intensity or duration of light is an important cause of infrequent estrous cycles in cats housed indoors. Breeding catteries should provide 12 to 14 hours of daylight or artificial light per day to encourage regular estrous cycles.",

There also appears to be a stimulus threshold individual to each queen that must be exceeded in order for adequate LH release to occur. Unlike the rabbit, in which a single mating is sufficient to induce ovulation, queens vary considerably in the number of copulations required to induce sufficient LH release and ovulation. Most queens will ovulate after four or more copulations. 25 Ovulation occurs 48 hours or more following the LH surge. 95 All oocytes are released at the same time. The remaining granulosa cells of the ovarian follicles undergo luteinization and begin to produce progesterone almost immediately. Progesterone concentrations rise within 24 hours, and may reach highs of 60 to 90 ng/mL (190.8 to 286.2 nmol/L) by 15 to 25 days post-ovulation. 113 Peak progesterone concentrations are highly variable from queen to queen. Throughout pregnancy, progesterone is maintained at high concentrations until the last few days of gestation, when the level falls to about 2 ng/mL (6.4 nmol/L) and to less than 1 ng/mL (3.2 nmol/L) immediately following parturition. 113 A minimum progesterone concentration of 1 ng/mL (3.2 nmol/L) appears to be necessary to sustain pregnancy in the queen. 109 Although progesterone declines at term, baseline concentrations are not required for onset of parturition in the queen, as in the bitch. 55 Progesterone test kits designed for ovulation timing in the bitch have been validated for use in the queen. 6 As for other induced ovulators, recent research suggests the corpus luteum (CL) may be the primary source of progesterone throughout pregnancy in the cat. 113 Conflicting evidence from earlier research showed maintenance of pregnancy despite ovariectomy at 45 to 50 days of gestation and demonstrated the ability of the feline placenta to synthesize progesterone.",

Relaxin is produced primarily by the placenta in carnivores, and facilitates delivery by softening the connective tissue of the pelvis, softening the cervix and relaxing uterine musculature. Relaxin concentrations increase as early as day 20 of gestation and are the basis of a commercially available pregnancy test (see below). 107 Prolactin is produced by the anterior pituitary and has various effects, including regulation of lactation. Prolactin concentrations increase from about day 35 of gestation, plateau at about day 50, and then increase abruptly just before parturition. 107 Prolactin appears to does not experience a pre-ovulatory rise in progesterone. After ovulation, fertilization of oocytes occurs in the oviducts, and the embryos enter a uterine horn 4 to 5 days after ovulation. 101 The embryos then space out along the uterine horns and may even migrate from one horn to another before implantation. Some embryos may be lost in this process. Implantation occurs about 12 to 13 days after breeding, and the implantation rate is estimated to be about 84%. 106 The feline placenta is endotheliochorial in structure and zonary in shape. Pregnancy length varies from 62 to 74 days in queens, with the average length being 65 to 67 days. 90, 97 If the oocytes are not fertilized after ovulation, a pseudopregnancy will occur that lasts about 40 to 50 days.

Very often the first estrus after a pregnancy is shorter and less fertile.

FSH, produced by the pituitary gland, initiates the development of ovarian follicles. Three to seven follicles develop and start producing estradiol-17b. As the follicular activity peaks, plasma estradiol levels increase and also vary widely but usually are greater than 20 pg/mL (greater than 73.4 pmol/L). 32 Estradiol levels stay high for 3 or 4 days during estrus and then abruptly fall. The high estradiol levels produce two important effects: overt estrous behavior and priming of the gonadotropin surge necessary to cause ovulation. Estradiol concentrations rise again about day 58 of gestation and then decline just before parturition. 55 Ovulation requires the release of luteinizing hormone from the anterior pituitary gland. During intromission, the penis probably causes distention of the posterior vagina 115 and induces release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the medioventral hypothalamus These studies indicate that noncopulatory ovulation may be possible in response to a variety of tactile, visual, auditory, or olfactory cues in queens. Unrecognized spontaneous ovulation and subsequent pseudopregnancy is one important cause for infrequent estrous cycles that must be ruled out in cases of apparent infertility. It is more appropriate to consider the queen to be both an induced and spontaneous ovulator, particularly when investigating cases of infertility or pyometra in a breeding cattery.",

Neoplasia in ovarian remnants, such as granulosa cell tumor, is a rare cause of ORS. Signs of estrus may occur weeks to many years after surgery 74 and include lordosis, vocalizing, rolling on the ground, and receptivity to intact males. Age at time of surgery and breed of cat do not appear to influence risk of ORS, although one report did not find any cases in queens spayed before 4 months of age. 74 The most common causes of ORS are failure to remove all or part of an ovary at surgery, accessory ovarian tissue 74 and revascularization of ovarian tissue inadvertently dropped into the abdomen during OHE. 19 Diagnosis is most commonly made by observing signs of estrus in a spayed cat and concurrent vaginal cytology consistent with estrus (cornified epithelial cells, absence of red or white blood cells, clear background). Documentation of serum estradiol levels greater than 20 pg/mL (greater than 73.4 pmol/L) while signs of estrus are occurring is also consistent with ORS, although the diagnosis cannot be ruled out if estradiol levels are low. Caution must be exercised with interpretation of baseline estradiol and progesterone concentrations; however, as there is considerable fluctuation with time. The diagnosis may also be established by inducing ovulation of mature ovarian follicles during estrus with GnRH (Cystorelin; Merial; 25 \u00b5g, IM) and documentation of elevated serum progesterone (>2 ng/ mL [6.4 nmol/L]) 1 to 3 weeks later. 51 A protocol has also been described to detect ovarian activity when a queen is not in estrus by administering the GnRH analogue buserelin (Receptal; Intervet/ Schering-Plough Animal Health; 0.4 \u00b5g/kg, IM) with measurement of serum estradiol 2 hours later. 5 24 hours apart (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg, SC). 57 Abortion will occur within 1 week.

Criteria for use include weak and ineffective contractions, poor response to oxytocin alone, and the presence of hypocalcemia. 59 Calcium therapy has been shown to be effective in bitches that failed to respond to oxytocin alone, even in the face of normal serum calcium concentrations. Calcium therapy is used much less commonly in the queen, because it may stimulate very strong uterine contractions. 54 The recommended dose of 10% calcium gluconate is 0.5 to 1.0 mL/cat by slow intravenous infusion with concurrent auscultation of the heart. 87 Some queens may also benefit from administration of dextrose (0.25 mL 50% dextrose diluted to 2 mL in sterile water or saline by slow IV infusion). 117 Uterine abnormalities, such as torsion or prolapse, are uncommon but present unique circumstances that may be life threatening. Uterine torsion typically involves only one horn and most often occurs during late gestation or parturition. Complete torsion may lead to uterine rupture and hemorrhage that is life threatening. Clinical signs of uterine torsion include abdominal pain, shock, hemorrhagic vaginal discharge, and obstructive dystocia. 59 Although radiography and ultrasonography may suggest the diagnosis, exploratory laparotomy is required for definitive diagnosis and treatment. The prognosis is favorable following ovariohysterectomy without correction of the torsion to avoid release of endotoxins and inflammatory mediators. 59, 89 Uterine prolapse is also uncommon in the queen, but more common in cats than dogs. The cervix must be open for prolapse to occur; so, the condition is seen during or immediately after parturition. Clinical signs include abdominal pain, straining, and a mass of tissue protruding from the vulva. The prolapsed tissue is often edematous and may be ulcerated and necrotic. If a uterine or ovarian blood vessel ruptures, life-threatening hemorrhagic shock may occur. The queen is stabilized with intravenous fluids before the prolapse is treated.

Cardiac massage using lateral chest compressions (1 to 2 compressions/second, pausing for breaths) may be used if a heart beat is not detected, and epinephrine (0.1 mg/kg IV, intratracheal, or intraosseous) may be administered if cardiac massage is not successful. 104 Doxapram has been administered for many years as a respiratory stimulant for veterinary neonates, but there is no evidence to support its use. The effect of doxapram is reduced in hypoxic states, making it ineffective in most apneic neonates. 75 ",

Diagnosis is based on clinical signs in a lactating queen with total serum calcium less than 8 mg/dL (<2 mmol/L). Eclampsia is treated with a slow intravenous infusion of 0.5 to 1.5 mL/kg of 10% calcium gluconate, repeated as needed. 59 Electrocardiographic monitoring should be used during treatment to detect bradycardia or arrhythmias.

Clinical signs include inflammation and pain should not be allowed to become chilled, because neonates cannot regulate their body temperature, and hypothermia occurs rapidly. Normal body temperature for newborn kittens is 97\u00b0 F to 98\u00b0 F (36\u00b0 C to 37\u00b0 C). Weak kittens with poor body tone may benefit from a few drops of 50% dextrose solution under the tongue. \"Swinging\" kittens and puppies to clear airways of fluids is no longer recommended because of the risk of potentially lethal cerebral trauma. 40 Oxygen may be administered using the end of a Bain circuit ( Figure  40-10 ). If vigorous rubbing and clearing the airways with a bulb syringe or mucus trap is not successful, the neonatal kitten may be intubated for oxygen administration and ventilation (slowly increasing up to 30 to 60 cm of water) with a large bore catheter (12 to 16 gauge) or a size 1 uncuffed endotracheal tube. The normal respiratory rate for newborn kittens is 10 to 18 breaths/minute. 39 An acupuncture technique for resuscitation of newborn kittens has been described using the Renzhong acupressure point (GV26). 96 A 25-gauge hypodermic needle is inserted into the nasal philtrum at the base of the nose until bone is felt and gently rotated. Although no controlled studies have been performed to evaluate effectiveness, anecdotally the technique seems valuable. 104 Drugs may be administered to neonates by several routes. Intravenous access is best achieved using the umbilical vein or the jugular vein in large kittens. Intraosseous needles or catheters can be placed in the proximal femur, especially if ongoing access is required for fluids or medications (see Chapter 41) . The intramuscular and subcutaneous routes are the least desirable, especially for administration of emergency drugs. Naloxone (0.1 mg/kg IV, SC or IM) may be administered to postcesarean section neonates to counteract vaginal discharge. Appropriate choices include fluoroquinolones or a combination of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and a fluoroquinolone. If the queen is nursing kittens, it is safest to avoid fluoroquinolones. However, the queen may be too ill to nurse kittens and handrearing may be required. If future litters from the queen are not desired, ovariohysterectomy can be performed once the queen is stable or the kittens are weaned. Antibiotic therapy should be continued for up to 4 weeks or for at least 10 days if ovariohysterectomy is performed. 117 If the queen is intended for breeding, uterine evacuation is indicated if the uterus is not friable and thin walled and no retained fetuses or fetal membranes are present. Oxytocin (0.5 to 1.0 U/cat, IM, every 30 minutes for 1 to 2 doses) is only effective within 24 hours postpartum. After that time, uterine oxytocin receptors are no longer present. Other drug choices for uterine evacuation include prostaglandin F 2alpha (0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg, SC) or cloprostenol (1 to 2 \u00b5g/kg, SC) every 12 to 24 hours to effect. 117 Treatment to evacuate the uterus may take several days and is not recommended in severely ill queens.",

Many reproductive hormones recommended for use in small animal theriogenology are not available in North America. Those products available are typically labeled for large animal or human use.

A variety of protocols using FSH or pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) for estrus induction in the queen have been described and the reader is referred elsewhere for details. 64 Both functional and nonfunctional cystic structures may affect feline ovaries, sometimes producing prolonged estrus. Ovarian cysts may be found incidentally during laparotomy (Figure 40-14) . Most cystic structures are within the ovarian bursa, having originated from the mesonephric or paramesonephric duct systems, and are nonfunctional. Functional ovarian cysts may be either follicular or luteal. Luteal cysts are rare in cats, and the more common follicular cysts typically do not produce clinical signs. Follicular cysts derive from persistent follicles that have not ovulated. If the cysts produce estrogen, prolonged estrous behavior may result. associated with inflammation and secondary bacterial infection. Traditionally, CEH has been classified as a luteal phase disease in bitches and queens. Progesterone induces hyperplasia of the surface or glandular epithelium and cystic dilatation of the uterine glands. 85 Proliferation of the endometrial glands produces a wavy, coil-shaped appearance of the uterine lumen that may be seen with hysterography or ultrasonography. 9 Fluid present in cystic structures or in the uterine lumen readily supports bacterial growth. Progesterone also inhibits local leukocyte responses and decreases myometrial contractility, which increases the risk of ascending bacterial infection. 14, 98 Bacteria are not normally found in the uterus, except in a small number of queens during estrus. 11 Endometrial hyperplasia may also be influenced by chronic estrogenic stimulation from recurrent estrous cycles that do not result in pregnancy. 85 In addition, estrogens increase progesterone receptors in the endometrium and dilate the cervix. 2, 8 In most published studies, older queens (average age 32 months to 7.6 years, range 1 to 20 years) and maiden queens greater than 3 years of age have the highest risk for CEH-pyometra.* Queens with uncomplicated CEH have no clinical signs of illness. Results of routine blood and urine testing are typically within normal ranges. CEH is associated with implantation failure and early embryonic death, resulting in small litter size or infertility.",

These queens have increased risk for uterine rupture and peritonitis. 16 Laboratory abnormalities in queens with pyometra include mild anemia (normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative), thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, as well as hyperproteinemia, hyperglobulinemia, hypokalemia, elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and azotemia. 16, 60, 77, 85 Radiography may demonstrate uterine enlargement, but may not rule out pregnancy ( Figure  40-19 ). Typical ultrasonographic findings are an enlarged uterus with convoluted tubular horns filled with flocculent material of variable echogenicity (Figure 40-20) . Ultrasonography is preferred versus radiography for diagnosis and to rule out pregnancy. A queen may have pyometra in one uterine horn and viable fetuses in the other. 16 Initial management of queens with pyometra depends on the status of the patient. Cats with closed cervix pyometra should be treated as emergency patients requiring urgent stabilization and surgical intervention. Cats with open cervix pyometra (diagnosed by the presence of vulvar discharge) are typically more stable and not in need of urgent intervention, although septicemia and endotoxemia are always a risk. Intravenous fluid therapy and correction of electrolyte imbalances may be necessary for some patients with open cervix pyometra. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (e.g., a fluoroquinolone plus ampicillin) is initiated for all queens with pyometra and can be adjusted based on the results of culture and sensitivity testing of vulvar discharge. 117 Therapy should be continued for at least 3 weeks.",
