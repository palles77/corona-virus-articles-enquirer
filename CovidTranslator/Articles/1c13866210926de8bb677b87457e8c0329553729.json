            "text": "Synthetic circuitry is composed of basic heterologous control components that fine-tune transgene expression in response to specific exogenous cues or endogenous metabolites 32 . These gene switches include triggerinducible protein-DNA 33-36 or aptamer-transcript interactions 37-39 , which control transcription and translation in response to heterologous and endogenous input signals (FIG. 1) . The standardized design of gene switches has improved functional compatibility 40,41 and has enabled the construction of higher-order networks -including multi-trigger inputs and sequential control 42,43 , mutual control 20,23,44,45 and feedback control 16, 19, 28, 46 of circuit components -that are able to provide complex protein expression dynamics with high precision and predictable logic in response to external cues or physiological pathways. Because most control components function in different bacterial and eukaryotic species after minor refinements 36,47-49 , gene switches and network blueprints that were pioneered in bacteria or yeast are often fully functional in mammalian cells. Examples of synthetic networks with similar components and circuit topology in bacterial and mammalian cells include: regulatory cascades 42,43 , epigenetic toggle switches 15,20,23,45 , hysteretic circuits 22,50,51 , molecular timing devices 30,52 , synthetic eco-sensing systems, synthetic quorumsensing systems, synthetic hormone systems 46,53,54 , bandpass filters 21,30,55 and different types of oscillators that program rhythmic transgene expression with a tunable frequency and amplitude 16, [26] [27] [28] [29] 56, 57 . Most of these first-generation synthetic circuits operated in isolation without any interface with the metabolism of the host cell, and they were used to program specific cellular functions using heterologous external input signals [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] .",

A repressor protein binds to its operator and thus prevents activation of the promoter and expression of the gene of interest. In response to an inducer, the repressor dissociates from the operator, the promoter is derepressed, and the gene of interest is expressed. b | Activation-based expression control. A minimal promoter (P min ) is activated when a chimeric transcription factor that is constructed by fusing a repressor protein to a transcription activation domain binds to its operator. In the presence of an inducer, the repressor protein-transcription-activation domain complex dissociates from its operator, P min is no longer activated, and transcription of the gene of interest is prevented. c | mRNA transcript-based expression control. A self-cleaving ribozyme is fused to a small-molecule-binding aptamer and introduced into the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of a gene of interest. In the absence of the inducer, the ribozyme undergoes self-cleavage, thereby eliminating the poly(A) tail (pA) from the open reading frame and preventing translation. However, in the presence of the inducer, the aptamer undergoes a conformational change, which inactivates the ribozyme and allows translation to occur.",

However, after a 30 kb SARS-like bat coronavirus was designed to contain the receptor-binding spike protein of its human homologue, the synthesized chimeric virus was able to replicate in culture and infect mice 74 . These in vivo studies revealed infectionenhancing mutations in the spike protein and established this surface protein as a key factor that is responsible for tropism switches in coronavirus zoonoses 74 . Reconstruction of pathogens by DNA synthesis can also be used for the production of diagnostic high-density antigen arrays 75, 76 , such as those used to profile post-Lyme-disease syndrome 76 or the humoural immune responses to hepatitis C and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 77 .",

High-throughput and high-precision assembly and engineering of entire genomes from welldefined genetic components using synthetic biology principles has provided new opportunities for the design of attenuated pathogens for use as vaccines. For example, primates immunized with virus-like particles that were produced by selective expression of particular chikungunya virus (CHIKV) structural proteins were protected against viraemia after a high-dose challenge; even immunodeficient mice that were treated with monkey-derived antibodies survived subsequent lethal doses of CHIKV 81 . DNA synthesis and assembly has also played an essential part in pioneering a safe live vaccine against the poliovirus 82 . The poliovirus was attenuated by systematic genome-scale changes of adjacent pairs of codons from over-to underrepresented codon sets in viral capsid genes (for example, GCC|GAA is strongly under-represented compared with GCA|GAG, although both encode Ala-Glu). These changes reduced translation and impaired the replication competence and infectivity of the virus. This attenuated poliovirus provides protective immunization in mice and offers a high safety standard given the low probability that all 631 individual changes will revert and thus reconstitute infectious wild-type viruses. The genome-engineering approach used here could represent a general strategy for designing live vaccines against infectious diseases. Other promising vaccination concepts include using antigen-producing immunostimulatory liposomes as genetically programmable synthetic vaccines 83 and the production of heat-stable oral algae-based vaccines to protect against Staphylococcus aureus infections 84,85 .",

Mosquitoes were engineered to express an intron-containing variant of the tetracycline (TET) transactivator (tTA) under the control of a flight-muscle-specific promoter (P FM ). In male mosquitoes, the intron is not spliced out, which prevents correct tTA translation. In female progeny, however, functional tTA translation is restored by sex-specific mRNA splicing. This results in the activation of the tTA-responsive promoter P TET and the expression of a toxic gene that triggers a flightless phenotype. If mosquitoes are raised in the presence of tetracycline (TET), tTA is prevented from activating P TET , which results in a normal phenotype. However, following their release into the TET-free environment, engineered males mate with wild-type females. This transmits the female-specific dominant flightless phenotype and should eventually result in the reduction or extinction of the wild-type population. b | Propagation of a selfish gene converting a heterozygous into a homozygous host.

As most chimeric transcription factors are derived from repressors that manage drug resistance in bacteria (for example, resistance to antibiotics 92 ) and are promiscuous for structurally related compounds, mammalian cells containing such circuitry could also be used in 'reverse mode' , as integrated screening devices for the class-specific discovery of new drug candidates 33,93 (for example, new antibiotics 92 ) (FIG. 3a) .

Using the same screening setup, compounds have been detected that lock the transcription factor onto the DNA, which may block induction of antibiotic resistance in pathogens and render them drug-sensitive 94 (for example, see Bioversys). Using such compounds alongside the specific antibiotic may offer novel anti-infective treatment opportunities and a new life cycle for established antibiotics (FIG. 3c) .

Using synthetic protein-polyacrylamide and DNApolyacrylamide monomers, hydrogels can be produced that dissolve when specific ligands are supplied (FIG. 4) . Biopharmaceuticals (for example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) supplied during gel formation are loaded into the hydrogel and can be released in a dose-dependent manner after subcutaneous implantation into mice and oral administration of the trigger compound 115 . It is thought that any trigger-inducible protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions could be used to produce drug-sensing and drug-releasing hydrogels 114, 116, 117 . In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells, the streptogramin-responsive repressor (PIP) was expressed by a constitutive promoter (P const ). PIP binds to its multimeric operator (PIR3) and represses expression of the reporter gene secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP). Exposing this screening cell line to a small molecule library only resulted in SEAP production for compounds that were streptogramin-like, cell-permeable and non-toxic (indicated by the brown star) . b | Discovery of small molecules that are able to overcome antibiotic resistance. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis antibiotic resistance regulator (EthR) was fused to the herpes-simplex-derived transcriptional activator (VP16) and expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293-T) under the control of a constitutive promoter (P const ). When EthR-VP16 binds to its cognate operator (O EthR ), the minimal promoter (P min ) is activated, which results in expression of the reporter gene SEAP. A screen is performed to identify a cell-permeable, non-toxic molecule (indicated by the yellow star) that prevents EthR binding to O EthR , stopping SEAP expression. c | Overcoming resistance to ethionamide in M. tuberculosis. In M. tuberculosis, EthR represses transcription of both the Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (EthA) and itself in a negative feedback loop. When 2-phenylethylbutyrate (indicated by the pink star) is added, it prevents EthR binding its target promoter (labelled 'P' in the figure). This derepresses EthA production, thereby turning ethionamide into a cytotoxic compound that kills the mycobacterium. pA, poly(A) tail. Interactive biohybrid material based on the interaction of a repressor protein with its cognate DNA operator motif. Homodimeric tetracycline repressor (TetR) is converted into a single-chain repressor (scTetR) by connecting two TetR subunits through a flexible peptide linker, and it is tagged with six histidines (scTetR-His 6 ). This molecule is coupled to a polymer and is mixed with a polyacrylamide that has copies of a tetracycline operator (tetO) attached to it. scTetR binds to tetO so crosslinks are formed, making a hydrogel. When tetracycline is added, scTetR releases tetO, and the gel is dissolved. This can be used to release another molecule that was attached to the polymer -in this case, the cytokine interleukin 4 (IL-4).",

The initial infection of a bacterial biofilm with this bacteriophage (known as T7 DspB ) results in rapid multiplication of the phage and expression of DspB. Following lysis, T7 DspB and DspB are released into the biofilm, which leads to re-infection and degradation of \u03b2-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine.

            "text": "Bacteria can communicate with each other using a chemical language known as quorum sensing. Individual bacteria produce and secrete signalling molecules (called autoinducers) that are common to multiple species or are species-specific. These molecules accumulate as the population grows and can bind to receptors that coordinate colony-wide gene expression or manipulate the behaviour of other bacterial populations. For example, Vibrio cholerae produces cholera autoinducer 1 (CAI-1) and autoinducer 2 (AI-2), which trigger repression of key virulence factors. Feeding infant mice with a probiotic E. coli that naturally produces AI-2 and has been engineered to constitutively synthesize CAI-1 significantly increased the animals' survival rate after ingesting V. cholerae 126 . This suggests that such an approach could be an economic strategy to prevent infectious diseases. Unlike antibiotics, quorumsensing-based interventions do not kill pathogens but reprogram their behaviour; this strategy may be free of selection pressure and therefore may be less prone to develop resistance. In another study, commensal bacteria were equipped with synthetic circuitry to stimulate glucose-dependent insulin production in intestinal epithelial cells 127 . After intravenous injection, Escherichia coli accumulates in cancer tissue, where it reaches high population densities. E. coli is engineered to link the quorum-sensing receptor LuxR to an autoinducer 1 (AI-1)-inducible promoter (P lux ). P lux is also used to drive luxI and the invasin gene inv. LuxI produces AI-1, generating a positive feedback loop that coordinates invasion throughout the population. b | Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin)-triggered killing of cancer cells after invasion of Salmonella spp. Salmonella spp. naturally invade cancer cells after intravenous injection. Salmonella spp. were engineered with a Pseudomonas putida-derived signal-amplifying two-level cascade in which NahR controls salicylate promoter (P sal )-driven xylS2 expression and XylS2 then triggers a XylS2-dependent promoter (P m )-driven expression of the cytosine deaminase (labelled CD in the figure) . Salicylate induces both NahR-based P sal and XylS2-mediated P m activation. Mammalian cells are resistant to 5-fluorocytosine because they lack cytosine deaminase, which converts 5-fluorocytosine into the toxic cancer therapeutic 5-fluorouracil. c | Invasive bacteria suppress oncogene expression. E. coli is engineered to constitutively co-express a catenin \u03b2-1-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA), Listeria monocytogenes listeriolysin (LLO*) and inv under control of the bacteriophage T7 promoter (P T7 ). They invade cancer cells (using the Inv protein), escape from the phagosome (using LLO*) and knock down the catenin \u03b2-1 oncogene (using shRNA). d | Therapeutic protein transduction. Lentiviral particles are produced using an integrase-negative helper vector (designated 'helper' in the figure) and a constitutive expression vector encoding the protein of interest (designated 'protein' in the figure) fused to viral protein R (VPR) and a protease cleavage site (PC). This can be delivered to any target cell in the absence of viral nucleic acids and proteins. An example application is described in the main text. pA, poly(A) tail.

Although native cytotoxicity or the constitutive expression of anticancer compounds have demonstrated some potential in animal studies and human clinical trials 128 , trigger-inducible drug expression circuits delivered by tumour-invasive bacteria or tumour-transducing viral particles may improve cancer therapy.

These bacteria have also been engineered to selectively invade and proliferate in tumour tissues and to produce cytotoxic compounds as well as reporter proteins for non-invasive follow-up monitoring of tumour regression 128 . These bacteria express flagella to penetrate tissue and chemotactic receptors to promote migration towards aspartate produced by viable cancer cells, ribose released by necrotic tissue or hypoxic regions generated by the hyper-metabolic activities of neoplastic cells. After they have reached the tumour site, the bacteria then either proliferate in the extracellular space or invade the tumour cells. In either situation, selective cytotoxicity was engineered by expressing toxins, cytokines, tumour antigens, pro-apoptotic factors or prodrugconverting enzymes 128 . Non-invasive E. coli has successfully been programmed to invade cultured tumour cells in a hypoxia-responsive or population-density-dependent manner. The corresponding circuitries consist of the anaerobically induced formate dehydrogenase promoter driving the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis invasin gene (inv), which mediates invasion using specific integrin receptors that are typically expressed on tumour cells. Populationdensity-dependent invasion requires an engineered quorum-sensing circuit that triggers inv expression after the bacterial population has reached a threshold size at the tumour site. This circuitry consists of quorum-sensing receptor LuxR that co-induces luxI (which encodes the enzyme producing the quorum-sensing messenger autoinducer 1 (AI-1)), and inv. AI-1-triggered, LuxRmediated expression of luxI represents a positive feedback loop that amplifies inv expression and AI-1 production; this coordinates and broadcasts the invasion order across the entire population 129 (FIG. 5a) .",

Gene therapy advances for cancer include virus-mediated delivery of cytotoxic effector genes controlled by cancer-specific promoters 138, 139 or delivery of chimeric adaptor proteins to link tyrosine kinase signalling to the apoptosis-inducing caspase machinery 140 . Most promoters and control circuits that coordinate simple reactions such as these are inherently noisy and only allow linear responses, which means limited control of specificity and efficacy. However, using two internal input signals can improve fidelity, mediate sharp response profiles and ensure robust biochemical processes 141 . Using decision-making circuits as blueprints, Nissim and Bar-Ziv 142 designed a tunable dual promoter integrator (DPI) to target cancer cells precisely. The DPI consists of two native promoters that are concurrently activated by two independent transcription factors. Each cancer-sensing promoter produces a different fusion protein in proportion to its activity, and these two proteins assemble together as a chimeric transcription factor. This transcription factor then activates a synthetic promoter that controls expression of the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (TK1), which is cytotoxic in the presence of nucleotide analogues, such as ganciclovir (FIG. 6a) . The DPI could be optimized for a specific cancer cell type by using different combinations of input promoters and effector genes, as well as by modulating the assembly efficiency and half life Figure 6 | Synthetic genetic cancer classifiers. a | A transformation-sensing cancer kill switch can consist of a two-input, transformation-sensing device with 'AND' logic. The device constantly monitors the transformation state of a cell and produces a kill signal when two malignancy markers occur. Two independent malignancy-sensitive promoters drive expression of two chimeric proteins (DocS-VP16 and Gal4 BD -Coh2). When they are simultaneously expressed, both proteins dimerize to form a synthetic transcription factor that binds Gal4 operator sites (O Gal4 ), induces downstream minimal promoters (P min ) and triggers expression of the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (TK1). In the presence of ganciclovir, the system is cytotoxic. b | A microRNA (miRNA)-based cancer classifier that discriminates cancer cells from non-transformed cells by scoring high and low expression profiles of a set of cancer-specific miRNAs. The classifier consists of high and low miRNA sensors that exclusively promote output gene expression if the specific input miRNAs are expressed at high or low levels, respectively. In the high miRNA sensor, high-target miRNA concentrations prevent translation of mRNAs encoding the reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator (rtTA) and the repressor of the lactose operon (LacI). This results in derepression of transcription of the output gene (labelled 'Output' in the figure). In the low miRNA sensor, the output-gene-encoding mRNA is only translated when low-target miRNA concentrations are present. c | By combining different high and low miRNA sensors, the classifier can be customized to sense predetermined profiles of high and low miRNA levels, such as the ones that are typically produced by cancer cells and respond with expression of the apoptosis-inducing human BCL2-associated X protein (BAX). pA, poly(A) tail.",

The RNA devices consist of a three-exon, two-intron minigene followed by the transgene. The introns contain protein-sensing aptamers, and the central exon includes a stop codon. Binding of the protein to the aptamers controls splicing of the minigene; when the central exon is spliced out, the transgene is expressed at high levels, and when it remains unspliced, the transgene is expressed at low levels. Such a device was configured to sense subunits of nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) or \u03b2-catenin (which are neoplastic markers) and to express the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase. Thymidine kinase renders cells susceptible to ganciclovir, so this device only operated as a cancer kill switch in the presence of the cancer markers and gangcicolvir 148 . The modular configuration of the RNA sensor-actuator device allows it to be tailored to different intracellular proteins and even to multi-protein input using specific intronic aptamers. Also, responsiveness and performance can be tuned by placing the aptamers at different locations within the introns. The availability of compact RNA sensor-actuators that are easy to design and to alter and that control transgene expression in response to intracellular levels of key proteins may also improve the ability to link metabolic disease states with gene-based therapeutic interventions.",

            "text": "An example of the use of a prosthetic network is the sensing of metabolites to improve control of urate homeostasis (FIG. 7b) . Moderate levels of uric acid, which scavenges radicals, are deemed to be beneficial. However, a transient surge in uric acid that is released by dying cells during cancer therapy leads to tumour lysis syndrome, and chronic hyperuricaemia can result in gout. Humans are particularly sensitive to imbalances of urate homeostasis because they lack uricolytic activity. A prosthetic network that constantly monitors blood urate concentrations and restores urate homeostasis by controlled expression of a urate oxidase -which reduces excessive urate concentration while preserving levels that are suitable for radical scavenging -could represent a treatment strategy for hyperuricaemic disorders 64 . In brief, human cells that contain such a prosthetic network have recently been designed by combining: the uric acid sensor HucR 154 , which manages oxidative stress protection in Deinococcus radiodurans; the human uric acid transporter URAT1 (also known as SLC22A12), which increases the intracellular uric acid levels and thus the sensitivity of the prosthetic circuit; and a secretionengineered urate oxidase (smUOX) that is clinically licensed for the treatment of the tumour lysis syndrome 155 . Figure 7 | Advanced therapeutic and prosthetic networks. a | Light-triggered transcription control of blood glucose homeostasis. The synthetic phototransduction cascade consists of rewired melanopsin and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) control circuits. Photo-isomerization of the 11-cis-retinal chromophore (R) by blue light (~480 nm) activates melanopsin. This sequentially turns on Gaq-type G protein (GAQ), phospholipase C (PLC) and phosphokinase C (PKC) and triggers Ca 2+ ion influx via transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs) and possibly also from the endoplasmic reticulum. This Ca 2+ ion surge activates calmodulin (CaM) to calcineurin (CaN), which dephosphorylates NFAT. NFAT then translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to specific promoters (P NFAT ) and coordinates transgene transcription. When linked to the glucagon-like peptide (GLP1), this mechanism allowed light-controlled blood glucose homeostasis to be achieved in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes. b | Prosthetic network for the treatment of tumour lysis syndrome and gout. Implanted sensor-effector cells are used to monitor serum urate levels constantly: they import urate via a transgenic human uric acid transporter (URAT1). Urate prevents binding of the uric acid-sensitive transsilencer (KRAB-HucR, which is the uricase regulator linked to a KRAB domain) to its operator (hucO 8 ). This operator controls expression of secretion-engineered urate oxidase (smUOX), so smUOX is expressed when urate concentration reaches pathological levels. smUOX mediates conversion of urate into allantoin. Expression of smUOX stops when urate concentration reaches oxidative-stress-protective urate levels. pA, poly(A) tail.

This was impressively demonstrated when UREX-transgenic cells were implanted into urate-oxidase-deficient mice, which develop acute hyperuricaemia with symptoms that are similar to human gout.

            "text": "An artificial insemination device. Artificial insemination is standard practice to facilitate both human reproduction and livestock breeding. Because of broad variations in oestrus expression and ovulation timing, coordinating sperm delivery with female oestrus is still a major challenge. Ovulation is triggered at a specific time when the pituitary gland releases luteinizing hormone, which binds to the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) and coordinates the release of the oocyte. By integrating synthetic signalling cascades with advanced biomaterials, Kemmer and colleagues 63 designed an artificial insemination device that coordinates sperm delivery with oestrus control. The artificial insemination device consists of cellulose sulphate capsules containing bull sperm and sensor cells 63, 156, 157 . The sensor cells are engineered to express LHR constitutively so that when it is activated, it triggers expression of cellulase that can be secreted. After implantation into the cow's uterus, the sensor cell line constantly monitors the animal's luteinizing hormone levels, and the oestrus-triggered surge in luteinizing hormone levels leads to the production of secreted cellulase, which degrades the implanted capsule and results in the timely delivery of the sperm and successful conception. Fine tuning of the designer cascade could enable its use in other species, including in humans.",

            "text": "In recent years, synthetic biology has substantially advanced strategies for classical biomedical applications, such as pathogen characterization 68, 70, 74 , disease analysis [78] [79] [80] , diagnostics [75] [76] [77] , screening assays 33, 92, 94, 100, 101 , drug production [105] [106] [107] [108] 158 and vaccination 81, 82, 85 . This progress may imminently develop into shorter drug discovery 94, 98 and drug development timelines, increased precision of drug delivery 112, 114 and production of new and more affordable medicines [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] . Ultimately, sophisticated therapeutic sensor-effector devices that can sense disturbances, seek out pathological conditions and restore function are on the roadmap. Such therapeutic networks that connect diagnostic input with therapeutic output may provide all-in-one diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic solutions in future gene-and cell-based therapies. Matching diagnostic outcome with high-end therapies has recently become a focus of the pharmaceutical industry, which has declared personalized medicine as the treatment strategy of the future. Tools that will have a tremendous impact in future biomedical applications include: using light-activated triggers to bring about a precise therapeutic response in cells 65 , programming bacteria to seek and destroy cancer cells 128, 132, 133 and using synthetic circuitry to keep crucial metabolites at homeostatic levels 64, 65 , to manage disease-controlled expansion 145 or to eliminate specific cell populations 31, 148, 159 . Recent work has shown that this is, in principle, possible and that some devices are working as expected and are producing a therapeutic impact in animal models of human diseases 64, 65 . Implants consisting of engineered microencapsulated cells represent a way of introducing prosthetic networks with a predefined function instead of directly targeting the host cells with the genetic material. Although implants containing cells with engineered prosthetic networks are certainly the most promising way forward, they will limit biomedical applications to extracellular disease metabolites that can be therapeutically addressed through the vascular system. However, there is still a long way to go until syntheticbiology-based biomedical devices will be a clinical reality. Placing therapeutic circuits in specific cells of a patient and making sure that there will be no interference with human metabolism are the most important challenges. Therefore, clinical use of synthetic-biology-based devices and therapeutic scenarios will face the same scientific, ethical and legal issues as any gene-and cell-based therapy, but they may offer more complex control dynamics and are therefore expected to have a higher therapeutic impact. Although none of the synthetic devices, prosthetic networks and related products that are pioneered by synthetic biologists have yet been used in the clinics or in clinical trials, the stage is set -with novel treatment strategies available and the commitment of the pharmaceutical industry in place -for synthetic biology to deliver the biomedicines of the twenty-first century.",
