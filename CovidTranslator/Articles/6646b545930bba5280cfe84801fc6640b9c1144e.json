However, if the disease had been present at the location in the past and was considered eradicated or controlled, the disease is considered to be re-emerging. 1 Emerging infectious diseases are caused by new, or previously unrecognized, micro-organisms. Multiple factors contribute to the emergence of new infectious diseases. They include the increasing growth and mobility of the world's population, overcrowding in cities with poor sanitation, massive food preparation and international distribution, unsanitary food preparation, exposure of humans to disease vectors and reservoirs, and ecological changes that alter the composition and size of insect vectors and animal reservoirs. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the first emerging infectious disease of the 21st century.",

Re-emergence is caused by some of the same factors that cause newly emerging infectious diseases. Re-emergences or at least cyclical resurgences of some diseases may also be climate related. For example, the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation phenomenon is associated with resurgences of cholera and malaria. 2 As we observe new pathogens emerge, we are also witnessing a re-emergence of some old infectious diseases. In addition to the factors previously mentioned, human behavior is a major factor in re-emergence. Increased use of antimicrobial drugs has resulted in the development of resistant pathogens (eg, tuberculosis), allowing many diseases that were treatable with medications to recur. Decreased compliance with vaccination has also resulted in the re-emergence of diseases such as measles and pertussis.",

Symptoms of mild illness may include fever, runny nose, sneezing, cough, skin rash, and body/muscle aches. 10 Persons with pre-existing conditions, such as asthma or other respiratory diseases, may be especially prone to severe infections from EV-D68 and may experience difficulty breathing or wheezing. In 2014, all confirmed cased of EV-D68 infection were among children, many of whom had asthma or a history of wheezing.

Timely recognition of emerging infections will require early warning systems for rapid problem detection and prompt investigation and control to avert a public health crisis. A worldwide approach is crucial with a focus on strengthened response capacity and expanded international collaboration and communication. Nations must commit to the provision of adequate resources to address underlying socioeconomic factors. None of this will be possible without education. As we learn what poses a threat, we can alter our behavior to reduce the risk. Although multiple high-tech solutions are available to reduce the spread of infectious diseases, it is most important to remember hygiene basics and that we each play a significant role in reducing infections.",
