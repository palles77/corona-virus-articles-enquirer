            "text": "The oral mucosa in humans may manifest local or systemic disease and derangements produced by therapeutic agents. A significant proportion of therapy-related oral drug reactions appear to be lichenoid reactions, erythema multiforme and bullous lesions similar to idiosyncratic or immune-mediated skin reactions. 1,2 Inflammation of the oral mucosa (oral mucositis) is a particular side effect of conventional anticancer drug treatment and this has also been a feature of targeted anticancer therapy both monoclonal antibodies and small molecules. 3 Systemic disorders produced by anticoagulants or anticancer therapy may also be evident by bleeding or ulceration in the oral cavity. Buccal ulceration is also described as part of a generalized hypersensitivity reaction to drugs. 4 Excessive contact by therapeutic agents such as aspirin, potassium supplements, captopril, nicorandil, a potassium-channel activator and corticosteroids has been reported to produce local ulceration in the mouth. 1,2,4\u00c06 The increased use of mouthwashes over the last 20 years has also resulted in a number of reported adverse effects to the buccal mucosa in people. 7 While the buccal route offers some advantages for drug delivery because intestinal and first pass hepatic metabolism can be avoided, this is limited by the low adsorption across the oral mucosa and the irritant nature of many proposed permeation enhancers. 8 The major and minor salivary glands and their secretions also represent an integral part of the protective mechanism of the oral cavity and derangement of saliva production may lead to loss of integrity of the oral mucosa (see below). Many drugs enter the saliva by simple passive diffusion. 9 Drugs that effect motor coordination can give rise to drooling and disruption of cricopharyngeal coordination. 10 Drug-induced abnormalities of taste sensation are also welldescribed phenomena occurring in patients. Indeed, many alterations in the oral mucosa are those that are more readily detected by careful clinical observation in people rather than exhaustive histopathological examination of the buccal mucosa in laboratory animals.",

Many of these are for surgical, dental and hygiene purposes but some therapeutic agents are also developed for administration by the sublingual or buccal routes. These routes may be selected for substances that are broken down in the stomach or show a rapid first pass effect. As it is technically not feasible to perform full preclinical toxicity studies by the sublingual or buccal routes, conventional oral or parenteral routes are used for systemic toxicity studies on such compounds. The choice of the best route will to a large extent be dictated by pharmacokinetic considerations.

Inflammatory lesions are found sporadically in untreated laboratory rodents, dogs and primates. Gingivitis due to Shigella infections is reported in macaque colonies where intestinal shigellosis is endemic. 11 Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis affects the interdental papilla which occurs in primate colonies is strongly suggestive of endemic type D retrovirus infection. 11 WBN/Kob rats made severely diabetic with a single dose of alloxan were shown to develop an increase in inflammation in the oral cavity associated with mucosal hyperplasia distributed in the hard palate, central part of tongue and gingiva. The cause was uncertain although alloxan can reduce saliva flow or there may have been an increase in oral commensal microorganisms. 12\u00c014 Stomatitis can be induced by systemic administration of high doses of therapeutic agents of different classes. Anticancer and antimitotic agents are particularly liable to induce stomatitis both in experimental animals and in cancer patients. A notable example is bleomycin that is capable of producing stomatitis as part of its general effect on squamous cells. 15 A number of other cancer chemotherapeutic agents can produce mucositis involving the oral cavity, including some of the newer targeted anticancer therapies. For example, monoclonal antibodies and small molecules targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor have been reported to produce oral inflammatory alterations in both preclinical toxicity studies and in patients. 3, 16, 17 In humans, the adverse effects of therapeutic ionizing radiation on the salivary glands with ensuing reduction in the secretion of protective saliva may also give rise to inflammatory changes in the oral cavity. 18 Diuretics and other agents that are capable of producing severe electrolyte disturbances and uremia at high doses can also produce stomatitis when they are administered to laboratory animals. 19 These lesions may be analogous to the well-described association of ulcerative stomatitis and uremia in humans and laboratory animals. The dog appears very sensitive to the ulcerogenic effects of uremia in the oral cavity, although as there is a poor correlation between actual levels of blood urea and stomatitis, other factors are undoubtedly involved.

However, there has been an increasing awareness of dental lesions in toxicity studies, particularly as the teeth are visualized when the maxilla is examined histologically in inhalation studies. Study of the rodent dentition in inhalation studies has shown that spontaneous lesions of the dentition are quite common. In one laboratory, malformations (dental dysplasia) of the maxillary incisors were observed in 3% of female and 9% of male CD-1 mice and 14.5% female and 10.5% Sprague-Dawley rats in 24-and 18-month inhalation studies respectively. 31 Unlike in humans, the rodent incisor continues to grow and differentiate throughout life and is renewed every 40\u00c050 days. By contrast rodent molars grow little once root development is complete, although dentine production continues at a slower rate. Located at the center of the tooth is the vascular pulp. This is surrounded by proliferating ondotoblasts which form predentin which when calcified becomes dentin. Surrounding ameloblasts when induced by the presence of dentin produce the overlying enamel layer. It is these active cellular layers which can be modified or damaged by drugs, vitamin deficiencies, calcium, phosphate or magnesium deficiency, parathyroidectomy, hypophysectomy, hyperparathyroidism, adrenal insufficiency and fluorosis. 32 In the rat these ondontogenic cells have been shown by immunocytochemistry to express high levels of parathyroid hormone-related peptide and its receptor. 33 Studies in genetically modified mice have shown that parathyroid hormone-related peptide, a member of the parathyroid hormone family, is important in normal tooth development as well as cartilage and a number of other tissues and organs. 34 ",

Two weeks following a single intravenous dose of vincristine to young adult rats, a faint incremental line in the dentine was shown to occur, probably a reflection of a direct effect of the drug on the dentinogenic tissue at the time of injection. 40, 41 At higher doses, focal niche-like or punched-out defects in dentine were also observed, expression of more severe injury to highly sensitive dentinogenic populations at the time of injection. The precise mechanism of damage is not fully understood although decreased secretion of dentine matrix by odontoblasts was demonstrated. Administration of the alkylating anticancer agent cyclophosphamide or a single exposure to ionizing radiation also produces localized niche-like or punched-out defects in the rat incisor. 42, 43 Anticonvulsant drugs may also produce changes in the dentition of humans and experimental animals. In children, reported alterations include tooth root resorption, small teeth, delayed shedding of deciduous teeth and retarded eruption of permanent teeth, features similar to those found in hypoparathyroid or pseudohypoparathyroid conditions. 44 Tooth root alterations were also reported in a study in which young male Wistar rats were treated with diphenylhyantoin for one month. 45 Treated rats showed evidence of molar root resorption lacunae that penetrated the cementum and involved the dentine. The lacunae contained a dense infiltrate of cells contiguous with similar cells in the surrounding periodontal ligament. Changes were similar to those occurring in parathyroidectomized rats but not those in rats made hypocalcemic with a calcium-deficient diet. It has therefore been suggested that the changes induced by diphenylhydantoin in rats are similar to those in pseudohypoparathyroidism in which resistance of tooth roots to resorption is reduced. 45 High circulating levels of parathyroid hormone-related peptide has also been shown to disrupt ondontoblastic cell function and normal tooth growth in the rat. 46 Numerous drugs have been reported to produce tooth discoloration in humans and it may be either intrinsic or extrinsic in nature. 47 Extrinsic discoloration occurs in teeth that have erupted into the mouth and it represents a superficial discoloration which can be removed by cleaning. Offending agents include chlorhexidine and orally administered iron salts. Intrinsic tooth discoloration is a permanent change relating to interference with odontogenesis, notably produced by fluoride, tetracycline, doxycycline and minocycline. Discoloration of teeth and bone is a well-described side effect of tetracycline administration and it has also been reported in patients treated with doxycycline and the semisynthetic derivative minocycline. 48, 49 The ameloblastic epithelium of the enamel-forming tissues of growing incisors in Wistar rats treated with high doses of human recombinant epidermal growth factor developed hyperplasia. This was characterized by pseudostratification, increased nuclear\u00c0cytoplasmic ratio and increased cytoplasmic eosinophilia. 26 This finding is consistent with the presence of epidermal growth factor receptors in the cells of the enamel organ. 50 Administration of inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor or fibroblast growth factor receptor also has been shown to alter tooth formation in the rat. 39, 51 After several weeks' administration teeth become whitened and fractured. Histologically the teeth show reduced dentine formation with degeneration of ondotoblasts, presumably as a result of defective vascularization in a manner similar to that seen in the epiphyseal growth plate (see Chapter 5) .",

In humans these changes have been associated with administration of diphenylhydantoin (phenytoin) nifedipine and other calcium channel blockers, cyclosporin A, valproic acid and very occasionally trexenamic acid, erythromycin, sodium valproate, phenobarbitone (phenobarbital) and vigabatrin. 1,54\u00c057 Cyclosporin A, diphenylhydantoin and calcium channel blockers have been associated with similar changes in laboratory animals. 58\u00c060 In most instances there is swelling of the gingiva by firm nodular overgrowths around the teeth. Histologically, these overgrowths are characterized by marked acanthosis of the squamous epithelium overlying connective tissue that is infiltrated by large numbers of chronic inflammatory cells. In a rat model of cyclosporin A-induced hyperplasia the epithelium shows increased proliferative activity. 61 Fibrovascular proliferation may be marked. In patients treated with cyclosporin, myxomatous degeneration is described in association with dense infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes. 55 Secondary acute inflammation in association with food debris and hair shafts is described in dogs treated with oxodipine. 60 The forces behind these changes are unclear. Studies of changes induced by nifedipine and hydantoin have shown increases in extracellular ground substance and increased numbers of fibroblasts containing sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. 62\u00c064 These drugs may alter fibroblastic proliferative and synthetic activity, possibly by selection of a subpopulation of fibroblasts. 63 It has also been suggested that an underlying mechanism in phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia involves the decrease in salivary IgA that develops in some patients. 54 Study of cyclosporin A-induced changes have suggested that impairment of T lymphocyte function may permit overgrowth of oral bacteria and bacterial products which may influence fibroblast function. 55 A spontaneous form of gingival hyperplasia has been described in non-human primates (Macaca mulata). This is characterized by an enlargement of the marginal and alveolar gingiva by connective tissue consisting of relatively poorly cellular bundles of collagen fibers. The lesions show little inflammatory alterations and the overlying squamous epithelium shows mild hyperkeratosis only. 65 This pathology is similar to hereditary gingival fibromatosis in humans.",

Large vesicular cells with basophilic intranuclear inclusions are also found in the granular cell layer, identifiable as virus arrays by electron microscopy. 79 Malignant change has been described in these canine lesions and this can occur in young beagle dogs. 72 Although many types of papilloma viruses have been identified in both humans and animals, common antigenic determinants exist between viruses in different species. 80 This immunological cross-reactivity can be exploited in the immunocytochemical localization of papilloma viruses in epithelial lesions of many animal species. Papilloma virus antigen has been demonstrated in oral papilloma of dogs and rabbits using antisera to bovine papilloma virus type I. 71 Cells positive for virus and viral inclusions are located in the upper layers of the epithelium, especially within cells of the granular layer.",

They range from benign anomalies and cystic structures through to malignant neoplasms. The ameloblastoma comprises cords, nests, anastomosing strands or islands of ondontogenic epithelial cells within a fibrous stroma. The tumor cells resemble ameloblasts with the cords of spindle-shaped cells similar to the stellate epithelium bounded by a peripheral layer of cuboidal or columnar cells resembling the inner enamel epithelium. Other tumors of the odontogenic epithelium show induction of the mesenchymal elements or develop a complete sequence of odontogenic epithelium, odontogenic mesenchyme and dental hard tissues including dentine, enamel and cementum. These have been classified as odontoma characterized by the presence of dental hard tissues and odontogenic fibroma composed of undifferentiated or primitive mesenchymal cells of developing dental tissue. 67, 82 Odontogenic tumors developing in Fischer rats treated with aflatoxin were located in the upper jaw associated with the incisor teeth and were composed of proliferating fibroblast-like cells within which ovoid calcified bodies resembling cementum were seen. 83 Occasional inclusions of solid epithelial nests were also seen.

            "text": "Although salivary glands may not represent vital organs in the same sense as the kidneys or heart, severe derangement of their secretions can alter both the quality and quantity of saliva. The autonomic nervous system plays an important role in the release of saliva. \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation tends to produce a low volume of saliva of high viscosity, \u03b1-adrenergic stimulation a low volume fluid of low viscosity whereas cholinergic stimulation produces a saliva of high volume but low viscosity. 9 The severe oral complications of irreversible salivary damage and dysfunction which occurs in patients with head and neck cancer as a consequence of local irradiation may have a significant impact on the efficacy of therapy, quality of life and survival. 18, 84 Although a large number of drugs are associated with dry mouth, particularly in patients treated for hypertension or mental disorders, this does not seem to always correlate with diminished salivary gland function. 1, 18 Drugs that appear to be associated with measurable glandular hypofunction are those with anticholinergic properties. Some drugs may occasionally cause painless bilateral swelling of salivary glands in patients. 2 A protective layer of mucus, a visco-elastic material containing high molecular weight glycoproteins produced by the major and minor salivary glands, covers the stratified squamous mucosa of the oral cavity. These mucins usually contain more than 50% carbohydrate in the form of neutral and acidic oliosaccharide chains, O-glycosidically linked to threonine or serine. Mucins possess several roles including mechanical flushing of the oral cavity, protection and lubrication of soft and hard tissues, modulation of oral microbial flora, buffering activity, regulation of calcium/phosphate equilibrium, digestion and extracellular post-translation processing of molecules present in saliva. 85 The heterogeneity of salivary glycoproteins suggests that they act as a defense against pathogenic microorganisms by competing with microbial binding sites of similar structure on the surface of cells lining the digestive tract. 86 Minor salivary glands may also play an important part in the local immuno-surveillance of the oral cavity for their ducts are anatomically closely associated with lymphoid tissue. 87, 88 Salivary secretions also possess digestive enzyme activity, although in herbivores and carnivores, it is usually low in contrast to high digestive enzyme activity in omnivorous species. 89 The phylogenetic association of the salivary glands with the thyroid gland is evident functionally because salivary glands are capable of concentrating iodide in their secretions, although this is not under control of thyroid-stimulating hormone. It has been shown that thyroxin accelerates the differentiation of the granular convoluted tubule cells and the appearance of epidermal growth factor in the submandibular gland of the neonatal mouse. 90 The structure of the salivary glands differs among laboratory species, between different glands in the same species and between sexes. It is usually considered that there are three major salivary glands, the parotid, the sublingual and the submandibular (submaxillary) glands. Minor salivary glands are scattered in other locations throughout the mouth and oropharynx. There is a high degree of structural variability in human anterior lingual salivary glands but their precise role remains uncertain. 91 In dogs and other carnivores, the zygomatic (infraorbital) gland, located just below the zygomatic arch and the buccal (molar) gland are also often referred to as major salivary glands.",

Controversy remains about the precise nature of the secretory cells found in the various salivary glands of different species and this makes critical interspecies comparisons difficult. 92 The duct system is less complex. This comprises an intercalated duct which leads from the secretory endpiece into a striated (secretory or intralobular) duct, so termed because their lining cells are striated by delicate eosinophilic cytoplasmic rods. The striated ducts converge into interlobular ducts and a main excretory duct system.",

            "text": "The submandibular gland is anatomically the most complex salivary gland in rodents. Secretory endpieces are composed of small or moderately sized cells with foamy cytoplasm and basophilic basal poles. The most striking feature is the presence of an additional duct segment interposed between the intercalated and striated ducts. This segment is lined by cylindrical epithelium with basal nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm containing secretory granules. This duct segment is termed the granular duct or granular convoluted tubule. The granules in these duct cells stain particularly well with the chromotrope-aniline blue stain but also orange G and PAS. 96 These granular cells are of special interest because they contain a large number of heterologous biologically active peptides including nerve growth factor, epidermal growth factor, renin, and kallikrinins. 97\u00c099 Epidermal growth factor is secreted in saliva and believed to promote wound healing. However, the precise physiological role of many of these peptides in salivary tissue remains uncertain. Epidermal growth factor was originally isolated from the mouse salivary gland where it was shown to produce premature eyelid opening and incisor eruption when injected into neonates. This led to the isolation not only of epidermal growth factor but also its tyrosine kinase-active receptor. 100, 101 Testosterone, thyroxin and growth hormone have been shown to regulate the concentration of epidermal growth factor in the rat submandibular gland. 99 Moreover, testosterone is responsible for the male pattern of the gland notably the larger volume of secretory tubules and cytoplasmic granules. Castration causes their regression and androgens their hypertrophy in castrated males and intact females. 102 Granular cells stain with antisera for epidermal growth factor. 96 The intracellular distribution of epidermal growth factor in acini and ducts has been confirmed in other species including humans. 103 Study of the mouse submandibular gland has shown that both epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor are released into saliva following the administration of phenylephrine, sympathomimetic amine acting mainly on \u03b1 receptors and isoprenaline (isoproterenol), a \u03b2 adrenergic agent. 104 Immunohistochemical study also demonstrates that epidermal growth factor becomes depleted in mouse salivary tissue following administration of phenylephrine and similar agents. 105 Phenylephrine has been shown to cause marked secretory activity accompanied by loss of granules from granular cells, as well as loss of immune reactive carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that participates both in membrane transport of bicarbonate ions into saliva and glandular secretion. 106 Morphological studies have shown that both acinar and granular tubular cells participate in this response to adrenergic agents. This is in contrast to the effects of pilocarpine, a cholinergic agent, which elicits the secretion of saliva deficient in serous proteins with little or none of the growth factors, as its effects are more limited to acinar cells.",

            "text": "Focal chronic inflammation of the salivary glands occurs sporadically in untreated rats, mice, hamsters, dogs and primates employed in toxicology although severity and prevalence is variable. Acute and chronic inflammation may also develop in glands affected by vasculitis, whether spontaneous in nature or induced by xenobiotics. 114 Sialoadenitis as a result of the sialodacryoadenitis corona virus is a well-known and fairly ubiquitous condition in rats, first described by Innes and Stanton in 1961. 115 The condition is characterized histologically by edema and congestion of submandibular and parotid salivary glands as well as extra-orbital lachrymal and harderian glands (Figure 8.1). It is accompanied by inflammation of variable severity and chronicity in both glandular and connective tissue as well as degeneration and necrosis of duct epithelium. Depletion of salivary gland epidermal growth factor also occurs during the infection. The regenerative hyperplasia of the duct epithelium may be quite intense about a week after infection but all changes regress after about two weeks and glands are essentially normal after three or four weeks. 116\u00c0118 There may be a delay in the appearance of inflammatory cells and the onset of repair in rats treated with immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclophosphamide. 119 Suppurative infections in the neck region of the rat such as those produced by Klebsiella aerogenes also cause acute and chronic inflammation of salivary glands with fibrosis and glandular proliferation of salivary tissue. 120 Sialadenitis occurs spontaneously in autoimmune-prone strains of mice such as the NZB/NZW and SL/Ni strains and it has been reported in aging female but not male BDF1 mice. 121 The non-obese diabetic mouse known for its spontaneous insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus also develops immune-mediated damage to submandibular glands. 122, 123 In aging BDF1 females the submandibular gland was shown to be involved by a destructive inflammatory process characterized by an intense infiltration by small and mediumsized lymphocytes, associated with mild inflammation in other organs such as the parotid and sublingual glands, pancreas and kidney. Immunocytochemistry showed that most of the lymphocytes were T cells of the helper/inducer subset (CD4 positive) and less than 10% were of suppresser/cytotoxic (CD8 positive) type. Circulating antisalivary duct antibody of IgG was also detected in afflicted mice. It was suggested that helper/inducer T cells played a key role in the production of this change, unlike induced autoimmune sialoadenitis in which cytotoxic T cell subsets may directly destroy glandular tissue. It has been suggested that this process in aging females is related to the decline in the number of suppresser/cytotoxic T cells in mice with advancing age. 121 In the non-obese diabetic strain of mouse derived from JcL-ICR mice, a periductal chronic inflammatory infiltrate is found in the submandibular gland at about the same time that immune-mediated insulitis is most marked. This suggests that there is an extension of the autoimmune process to salivary tissue. 122 It is probable that helper/inducer CD4 T cells are essential components of this infiltrate and a number of cytokines and their receptors such as IP-10 (interferon \u03b3 inducible protein 10) and RANTES (regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) may have an important role. 123 An autoimmune type of sialoadenitis can also be experimentally induced in certain strains of mice. CRJ:CD1 mice, thymectomized at three days, a time point at which CD8 suppresser T lymphocytes can be maximally reduced, followed by immunization at 28 and 42 days after birth with homogenates of salivary gland and complete Freund's adjuvant, develop a distinctive sialoadenitis in the submandibular and to some extent the parotid glands. 124 This sialoadenitis is characterized by degenerative changes in salivary glandular tissue associated with an extensive and intense infiltrate of small and mediumsized lymphocytes mostly suppressor/cytotoxic T (CD8) lymphocytes. These cells appear shortly after immunization but increase in number with time. Plasmacytoid lymphocytes contain immunoglobulin of mainly IgG class appear later. 124 Immunization of BALB/c mice with short peptides from the 60 kDa Ro (or SSA) antigen, which is a common target of the autoimmunity of Sj\u00f6 gren's syndrome in humans, also develop similar pathology. This human syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the exocrine glands with associated lymphocytic infiltrates of the salivary glands. Dryness of the mouth and eyes result from functional disturbance of the salivary and lacrimal glands. 125 Affected mice show lymphocytic infiltrates in salivary tissue consisting of both T and B lymphocytes reminiscent of the human Sj\u00f6 gren's syndrome. 126 In the hamster salivary glands, interstitial infiltrates of lymphocytes and plasma cell are quite common and may become more marked with advancing age. 127 Whereas necrosis of the parotid gland of uncertain etiology sometimes occurs in the dog, mild focal chronic inflammation is quite a common incidental finding in canine salivary glands. It has been reported in about 5% of normal beagle dogs. 128 Inflammatory cell infiltration of the submaxillary and parotid salivary glands is also found commonly in untreated cynomolgus monkeys. 129 Although the inflammation in salivary tissue which results from ionizing radiation is only indirectly relevant to drug safety evaluation, it is pertinent because it demonstrates species differences in sensitivity. Serous acinar cells in humans and rhesus monkey appear least resistant to the effects of ionizing radiation, where damage is characterized by widespread degranulation and degeneration of acini, infiltration by polymorphonuclear cells followed by lymphocytes, plasma cells and subsequent atrophy and fibrosis. 112, 113 Xerostomia, a dryness of the mouth due to salivary gland dysfunction, can develop in cancer patients following local ionizing radiation to the gland. 84 These changes contrast with the lesser effects of ionizing radiation on the rodent salivary glands in which there is little or no acute inflammatory response.",

            "text": "Like many other glandular organs, the size of the secretory tissue of the salivary gland is responsive to functional demand and is subject to age-related changes. In humans the gland parenchyma frequently becomes atrophic and replaced by connective tissue or fat with advancing age, possibly partly related to vascular changes. 130, 131 In aging rats, the extent and height of granular ducts and their content of mature secretory granules has also been shown to decrease with age. 132 Dietary factors influence salivary gland size. Decreased food consumption or protein starvation can reduce the weight of salivary glands in rats. There is shrinking of mucous and serous glands and loss of zymogen granules associated with decreased RNA but unchanged DNA content, attributable to the reduced requirements for protein synthesis. 133, 134 As salivary gland function is responsive to adrenergic stimulation, it is not surprising that atrophy occurs following adrenergic blockade. The weights of the submandibular gland in mice were shown to decrease following administration of the \u03b2 adrenergic blocking agent propranolol. 135 This was associated with a reduction in stainable neutral mucins and a decrease in the thickness of the acinar cells making the gland lumens appear larger than normal. Although repeated administration of phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been shown to increase the size of salivary glands in rats, a study of the rat salivary gland after a single dose of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline has shown that this is preceded by a reduction in the size of acini. 136 Drugs possessing \u03b1 or \u03b2 adrenergic blocking effects have also been shown to result in a reduction of salivary flow rate in patients. 9 The cytotoxic agent alloxan, known primarily for its specific effect on pancreatic B cells, has also been shown to produce weight loss of the rat submandibular gland, associated with lipid inclusions in the acinar cells, capillary basement membrane thickening and reduced salivary flow possibly as a result of cytotoxicity. 13, 14 Methotrexate, a folic acid antagonist, has also been reported to cause vacuolization of acinar and ductular cells with reduction of secretory granules in rat salivary glands. 134 Ligation of the main excretory ducts has frequently been used as an experimental model for study of salivary gland atrophy as well as the regeneration that follows removal of the ligature. Following ligature there is atrophy of all cell types but particularly the acinar cells through a process of apoptosis. Although overt necrosis has been reported following ligation of the excretory duct, it appears that this may have been the result of constriction of the vasculature for acinar cells, which are relatively intolerant to decreases in oxygen and nutrients. 137 Weight increase, diffuse hypertrophy and hyperplasia A number of therapeutic agents increase salivary gland size in humans, although the scarcity of biopsy data precludes a critical assessment of the precise pathology in many cases. Drugs reported to produce salivary gland enlargement in humans include iodidecontaining radiological contrast media, isoprenaline, lithium salts, phenytoin and antiinflammatory drugs phenylbutazone and oxyphenbutazone. 9, 138, 139 A number of these drugs are also linked to treatment-related increases in salivary gland secretion in patients. 9 Salivary gland enlargement may also occur after endotracheal anesthesia and upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy in humans. 140 Some of these agents and procedures may produce spasm of large salivary ducts and retention of secretions. High circulating growth hormone levels are also associated with salivary gland enlargement in patients which correlates with concomitant raised serum IGF-I concentrations. 141 In rodents several pharmacological agents, particularly sympathomimetic amines, have been shown to produce increases in salivary gland size following repeated dosing. 142 There is an intimate relationship of sympathomimetic amines with the control of the secretory process in salivary tissue. A single injection of isoprenaline (isoproterenol) in the range of 20\u00c0200 mg/kg induces discharge of preformed secretory granules followed by gradual resynthesis and reconstitution. However, repeated injections produce an increase in the size of salivary glands. The enlarged glands are composed of secretory cells of increased size 338 8 . DIGESTIVE SYSTEM that contain increased amounts of secretory substances in the cytoplasm accompanied by DNA synthesis and differential changes in RNA transcription. 143, 144 These histological features are principally those of diffuse cellular hypertrophy. However, the increase in DNA content and radioactive thymidine uptake described in the salivary tissue following repeated administration of isoprenaline suggests that hyperplasia also occurs. 145 These effects do not depend on the integrity of the autonomic nerves because they occur after ablation of the autonomic ganglia. 145 They appear to be mediated by an effect on adrenergic \u03b2 receptors because the effects can be blocked by propranalol, a \u03b2 receptor antagonist but not by phenoxybenzamine, an \u03b1 receptor antagonist. 142 As theophylline and caffeine also elicit salivary gland enlargement in rats preceded by initial discharge of secretions, a role for cyclic 3 0 ,5-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in salivary gland enlargement has been postulated. 142 However, as administration of a \u03b2 receptor antagonist has also been shown to diminish the response to theophylline, \u03b2 adrenergic activation may also play a role in this effect.",

Similar regenerative hyperplastic duct changes are also seen in necrotic and inflammatory conditions in the dog salivary gland. 128 Morphological examination and immunocytochemical study of epidermal cytokeratins of the rat salivary gland after arterial ligation has shown that the acinar units can also undergo squamous metaplasia. 158 The acinar-intercalated duct complexes appear to rapidly reprogram to produce epidermal cytokeratin filaments in ischemic states.",

However, mitotic activity was evident throughout the duct epithelia. Acinar cells also showed hypertrophy with depletion secretory granules and the presence of large vesicular nuclei. 27 A high incidence of ductal hyperplasia has also been described in the submandibular glands of rats treated for 26 weeks with a synthetic steroid possessing both progestagenic and estrogenic activity. 96 Lesions were characterized by microcystic duct-like or cribriform structures lined by single or multilayered epithelium and surrounded by myoepithelial cells. Immunocytochemistry showed that nuclei of lesions as well as normal gland possessed abundant progesterone receptors but were devoid of estrogen receptors. It was argued that this represented an exaggerated response of the intercalated duct to a high dose of a particular ratio of estrogenic and progestagenic activity.",

However, patients of all ages may be affected. Women have been injured more frequently than men probably because of the greater likelihood of their being treated with potentially injurious drugs. 166 The shape and surface coating of tablets may influence their tendency to adhere to the mucosa and lodge in the esophagus. 168 A wide variety of drugs have been implicated. In the United States as well as other countries many cases appear to be caused by ingestion of tetracycline or doxacycline. 167, 169 Some of the causative agents such as potassium chloride, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are also implicated in ulceration lower in the gastrointestinal tract. 170 Over recent years the bisphosphonate alendronate has been a common cause of adverse effects in the esophagus and severe injury has been reported. Injury is linked to ingestion without water or failing to remain upright after swallowing the medication as alendronate is particularly caustic. 166 However, this risk is now better known and only a low incidence of esophageal damage is now reported. 171 Esophagitis due to Candida albicans is a well-described complication of antibiotic therapy particularly in patients being treated with immunosuppressive drugs or in HIV-infected patients. 161 A number of agents affecting neuromuscular coordination may also predispose to gastroesophageal regurgitation and reflux esophagitis. 164 In laboratory rodents spontaneous lesions of the esophagus are occasionally seen. Esophageal impaction has been described in untreated SrL:BHE rats. This is characterized by massive dilatation of the esophagus with food or bedding. 172 The muscle fibers in the wall of the esophagus show varying degrees of degeneration including swelling or shrinking of fibers, myofibrillar fragmentation, cytoplasmic vacuolation and mineralization. So-called megaesophagus, characterized by enlargement of the esophagus, degeneration of muscle fibers and ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus, has also been described as spontaneous lesions in some strains of rats and mice. 173, 174 Megaesophagus is reported in both animals and humans as a result of congenital or acquired motility disturbances affecting the esophagus.",

The prevalence of these gastric lesions varies between species and strains of laboratory rodents as well as between different laboratories. The cause of forestomach ulceration often remains unclear although a variety of factors have been associated with its development including advanced age, infection, parasitism, diet, feeding regimens and stress. In rats, conflict-induced ulceration occurs in the forestomach and there is an age-related susceptibility; older rats developing more ulcers than younger rats. 185 In rats and mice dying of spontaneous disease, ulceration of the forestomach is quite frequently observed. Protein restriction or starvation has also been shown to produce forestomach ulceration in rats. 186 WBN/Kob rats made diabetic with a single dose of alloxan develop an increase in forestomach inflammation associated with the increase in the presence of Candida albicans and bacteria and eventually proliferative lesions (see below) which were shown to be alleviated by treatment of diabetes with insulin or administration of antifungal drugs. 12, 187, 188 Histological features of ulcers and inflammatory lesions of the forestomach are similar in rats, mice and hamsters. In mild cases, a scattering of acute inflammatory cells is seen in the intact squamous mucosa. Ulcers can be single or multiple and are characterized by loss of squamous epithelium with a variable accumulation of neutrophils, mononuclear cells, cellular debris, fibrin and hair fragments in the ulcer crater (Figure 8 .2). The inflammatory process may extend deeply into the stomach wall and be associated with intramural inflammation, edema, endarteritis and fibrosis. Some agents appear to induce primarily a submucosal or intra-epithelial inflammatory process giving rise to pustule formation suggesting that the effects are not mediated by local direct irritancy. 189 Hemosiderin pigment can also be found in the ulcer margins. Profuse hemorrhage may follow erosion of large blood vessels and complete perforation of the stomach wall with peritoneal involvement also occurs. 190 In long-standing cases of ulceration, hyperplasia of the adjoining squamous epithelium occurs, characterized by irregular acanthosis and down-growths of squamous epithelium into the submucosa. 191 In rodent toxicology studies ulceration of the forestomach is often sporadic and its distribution among animals shows no clear relationship to dose. If ulceration is limited to high dose groups, it may be a result of non-specific toxicity. However, some chemicals have direct local effects of sufficient severity to cause focal damage to the forestomach mucosa.",

Vitamin A deficiency linked to squamous metaplasia in glandular tissues may produce forestomach hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis in rats. When SPF Fischer 344 rats were maintained in a vitamin A deficient state for over three months, hyperplasia with hyperkeratosis, not unlike that produced by carcinogens, was reported. 193 Diabetic rats have also been shown to develop squamous hyperplasia more prominently in the greater than the lesser curvature and most marked near the limiting ridge. This was associated with inflammation in the forestomach and the presence of Candida albicans which may have been a significant pathogenetic factor. 188 Administration of a wide range of genotoxic and non-genotoxic industrial chemicals and therapeutic agents may produce hyperkeratosis and hyperplasia of the forestomach epithelium. The extensively used antibiotic ampicillin produces inflammation, ulceration, acanthosis and hyperkeratosis of the forestomach mucosa of mice but not rats when administered for two years. 194 Sodium saccharin is also reported to produce hyperplasia without neoplasia in the forestomach in Fischer 344 rats. 195 Cytoprotective prostaglandins also appear capable of inducing hyperkeratosis and hyperplasia without neoplasia presumably through a mechanism related to their trophic activity. 196 This occurs in rats treated with misprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin E 1 analog with gastric antisecretory and anti-ulcer activity and other synthetic analogs of prostaglandin E 1 and E 2 types. 197\u00c0199 Among its wide range of pharmacological effects on the gastrointestinal tract, the forestomach also responds to recombinant epidermal growth factor when infused into rats. 26, 179 Histologically, the changes are characterized by hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis with varying degrees of acanthosis and papillomatosis. 190 The changes can be florid and it may be difficult to make a clear distinction between severe hyperplasia and neoplasia. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the florid hyperplasia of the forestomach epithelium without evidence of cellular atypia can be completely reversible following the withdrawal of an inciting stimulus, ethyl acrylate. 200 Hence, an important feature is the presence of cellular atypia in view of its association with agents with potent (genotoxic) carcinogenic activity, particularly if it occurs rapidly following initiation of treatment.",

Butylated hydroxyanisole possesses little or no mutagenic activity in vitro but when administered to rats for two years as a 2% mixture in the diet, it was shown to produce inflammation followed by squamous hyperplasia, squamous papillomas and squamous carcinomas of the forestomach. At 0.5% in the diet butylated hydroxyanisole induced only hyperplasia. 215 Studies in which butylated hydroxyanisole was fed in the diet to rats for shorter periods have shown that squamous epithelial hyperplasia occurs after only one week of treatment mainly over the lesser curvature, the site at which carcinomas developed in the two-year studies. 192 After 13 weeks of treatment, mucosal hyperplasia characterized by pronounced hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis and acanthosis most pronounced over the lesser curvature was present in rats given 2% butylated hydroxyanisole in diet but not in rats given 0.5, 0.25 and 0.1% mixtures. 216 Abundant mitoses were found in the basal cells layers and tritiated-thymidine labeling confirmed that hyperplasia was accompanied by a high rate of cell proliferation. Following cessation of administration of butylated hydroxyanisole after 13 weeks, the tritiated-thymidine labeling index rapidly reverted to control levels within about one week although hyperplasia took longer to regress. Nearly complete regression of the hyperplasia occurred after about nine weeks of normal diet. 216 The distribution of squamous hyperplasia induced in the rodent stomach by butylated hydroxyanisole is influenced by the mode of administration. Following feeding of rats with butylated hydroxyanisole mixed in the diet, lesions tended to be located near the limiting ridge whereas gavage in corn oil produced similar changes at the apex of the forestomach. 192 It therefore has been suggested that such differences are due to incomplete mixing of butylated hydroxyanisole in the stomach lumen when given by gavage and prolonged contact of the gavage mixture with the upper segment of the forestomach. Moreover, it has been shown that Fischer 344, SHR, Lewis and Sprague-Dawley rats differ in their response to the hyperplastic and carcinogenic effects of 2% butylated hydroxyanisole in pelleted diet. The most sensitive appears to be the SHR strain followed by the Fischer 344 rats. The differences correlate with the cytotoxic effects of butylated hydroxyanisole in the different strains. 217 The presence of vascular damage in the stomachs of the SHR rats might contribute to the response to cytotoxicity and subsequent carcinogenicity.",

            "text": "Residence time of administered compounds in the forestomach may influence the development of lesions. Although it has been demonstrated that butylated hydroxyanisole does not produce hyperplasia in the esophagus of animal species without a forestomach, high doses given to primates are capable of producing an increase in mitotic activity in the lower end of the esophagus similar to that occurring at equivalent exposure levels in the rat forestomach. 218 The implication is that these interspecies differences may simply be a question of differences in exposure of the squamous mucosa to compound. This underlines the fact that mechanisms of action and exposure levels of xenobiotics attained in the gastrointestinal tract of rodent and non-rodent species as well as of humans need to be assessed when hyperplasia and neoplasia are induced in the forestomach mucosa of rodents. Such information can clearly be helpful in facilitating decisions made by government's regulatory authorities in this area. 219 However, in the case of butylated hydroxyanisole the evidence suggests that the tumor development in rodents represents an epigenetic phenomenon related to largely reversible cytotoxicity, inflammation and increased cell proliferation. 207 In view of the low levels of exposure to butylated hydroxyanisole that occurs with the usual use of this agent, carcinogenic hazard for the human stomach is therefore very small. Similar phenomena have also been reported in studies of phenols and acids that are structurally related to butylated hydroxyanisole. 208 These agents include n-butyl and n-propyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid esters, propionic acid and 4-methoxyphenol. However, these studies suggested that certain areas of the forestomach epithelium react differently to structurally related chemicals, possibly due to the variable levels of activating enzymes within different zones of the forestomach epithelium. Co-administration of acetylsalicylic acid was shown to abrogate some of these effects, suggesting that prostaglandin synthetase may be involved in the hyperplastic response. 208 A number of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) with different chemical structures including marketed products such as lovastatin, simvastatin and fluvastatin are also associated with the development of squamous hyperplasia of the rodent forestomach. Hypolipidemic agents that inhibit oxidosqualene have also been reported to produce squamous hyperplasia in the forestomach of mice and hamsters. 220, 221 The hyperplasia produced by the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is time and dose dependent and may be associated with edema and inflammation of the submucosa. Some but not all of these agents are also capable of producing squamous neoplasia of the forestomach mucosa of rats, or mice or both after long-term treatment. 210\u00c0212,222,223 The mechanism of action remains unclear, although this effect seems correlated to their pharmacodynamic activity. Detailed morphological study of the forestomach in rats treated with lovastatin suggested that it is related to the effects on the assembly of cholesterol and other lipids into the lamella bodies and intracellular lipid sheets. 224 Their tumorigenic potential in rodent bioassays does not seem to relate to the degree of hyperplasia in short-term studies. 204 Moreover, the development of hyperplasia depends on local high concentrations of drug because when administered by non-oral routes, hyperplasia does not occur. 210 As most of these drugs are non-mutagenic, these findings are presumably also epigenetic in origin and possess relatively little risk for humans when given in the usual therapeutic doses.",

The proliferative changes and inflammation was shown to be alleviated by treatment of diabetes with insulin or administration of antifungal drugs and the number of neoplasms also reduced. 12, 187, 188 A contrasting example is provided by aristolochic acid, a nitrophenanthrene derivative of the ancient medicinal plant Aristolochia clematis which was used as an anti-inflammatory component in a number of medicinal preparations in Germany until 1982. 213, 214 Aristolochic acid is found in the Aristolochia and Asarum species of plants, both in the Aristolochiaceae family, and is a direct-acting mutagen in Salmonella typhimurium. When fed to rats at doses of 1.0 and 10 mg/kg/day, aristolochic acid produced severe papillomatosis of the entire forestomach within a period of three months.

This is followed by a phase of irregular contractions that increase in amplitude and frequency to reach a maximum in a third phase. Feeding results in the replacement of this cyclic pattern by regular tonic contractions that move food towards the antrum and mix it with gastric secretions. These patterns have been well studied in both dog and humans and appear to be qualitatively similar in the two species. 232 These motility patterns may have an impact on the length of time drugs remain in contact with stomach mucosa. For instance, the residence time of large non-disintegrating capsules or tablets administered in the fasting state is more dependent on the frequency of powerful phase III contraction than if drugs are given as fluids or mixed with diet. For dosage forms released in the stomach, gastric residence time will influence drug supply to the main absorptive surfaces in the small intestine, which in turn may affect drug absorption. 233 Gastric acid is important in making ingested salts soluble. Although the presence of food in the stomach is a stimulus for acid production, the pH in the stomach of rats is highest in full stomachs and lowest when empty, presumably as a consequence of the buffering action of food. 234 ",

The gastric glands are simple tubular structures usually considered to comprise three segments. The base is the deepest part, the neck the mid-region, and the most superficial is the isthmus, continuous with the gastric pit. The upper part of the gastric gland contains mucous neck cells. Small cuboidal chief or zymogenic cells, which secrete pepsinogen and stain blue or purple in hematoxylin and eosin sections, are located in deeper parts of the gland. The eosinophilic-staining parietal (oxyntic) cells, which produce hydrochloric acid, are distributed more randomly throughout the gastric glands. Parietal cells can also be visualized by immunocytochemical staining with antibodies directed at H 1 K 1 -ATPase. 236 It has been suggested that gastric parietal cells may have an endocrine role because in rats it has been shown that they possess aromatase activity and an ability to synthesize estrogen. 237 The gastric glands situated near the limiting ridge in rodents show a simplified structure.

Immunocytochemical study shows a variety of other peptides in cells in different areas of the glandular stomach including somatostatin, glucagon, gastrin and serotonin reactivity. 245 Increased gastric acid secretion is initiated by activation of central vagal efferent pathways but acid secretion is maintained by both neural and endocrine reflexes activated by the presence of food in the stomach. Gastrin secreted from the G cells of the antrum is the main stimulant of acid secretion. Somatostatin is secreted from antral D cells when the luminal pH falls to below 3.5 to act by a paracrine mechanism to suppress G cell function thus forming a negative feedback loop. 246 The two main endocrine cell types from the body mucosa integrate neurohumoral stimuli rather than respond to luminal chemicals. Although gastrin is capable of stimulating parietal cells directly, it has an even greater effect through stimulation of enterchromaffin cells to release histamine, a potent paracrine stimulator of parietal cells. 247 Gastrin stimulates release of histamine from enterochromaffin cells of the body mucosa, which increases acid secretion through activation of parietal cell histamine H 2 receptors. Both parietal and enterochromaffin cells are inhibited by somatostatin released from the D cells of the body mucosa in response to a variety of neurohumoral stimuli such as norepinephrine (noradrenalin), vasoactive intestinal peptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and cholecystokinin. Gastrin acts at the gastrin/cholecystokinin B receptor that is expressed by gastric epithelial cells as well as by neurons in the central nervous system. 248, 249 The gastrin receptor is a cholecystokinin B type receptor located in the stomach. The other cholecystokinin receptor, cholecystokinin A, has high affinity for cholecystokinin. Stimulation of this receptor in the stomach mediates secretion of pepsin from gastric chief cells and release of somatostatin from D cells resulting in inhibition of acid secretion.",

The lifespan of surface epithelium in the stomach of rats, mice and hamsters has been calculated to be about three to four days. Studies of cell cycle and DNA synthesis time in the proliferative zones in the stomach have suggested that the generative cells in the isthmus undergo mitoses at about 30 hour intervals in rodents and 40 hour intervals in humans. 250 Although this process of migration from the proliferating cell zone of the isthmus renews surface epithelial cells rapidly, cell migration to the lower parts of the gastric glands is much slower and more complex. Detailed studies have shown that undifferentiated cells in the region of the isthmus represent a common source for surface mucous cells and mucous neck cells. 251 Studies in transgenic mice have shown that mature parietal cells influence the fate of other gastric epithelial cells because targeted degeneration of parietal cells is associated with loss of chief cells suggesting interactions between these cell populations in determining their differentiation. 236, 252 Labeling experiments in the hamster stomach have shown that both chief and parietal cells possess a similar but quite long lifespan of about 200 days. 253, 254 It has been suggested that the relative distribution of chief and parietal cells in the gastric gland represents an expression of their different migration patterns downwards from the proliferative zones in the isthmus. This type of migration pattern in which cells are able to overtake each other has been termed a stochastic flow system. 250",

This is a layer of mucus gel along with bicarbonate and hydrophobic phospholipids which maintains a near neutral pH as well as a physical barrier. 255 Much of our knowledge about mucins produced by the epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract has been obtained using histochemical techniques and these approaches can be helpful in the understanding of spontaneous and drug-induced gastrointestinal disease. 256\u00c0258 The physiochemical properties of gastrointestinal mucins are dependent on their glycoprotein constituents. These glycoproteins are high molecular weight compounds with large numbers of sugar chains attached to a polypeptide backbone by O-glycosidic linkages between N-acetylgalactosamine and serine or threonine. 259 The principal monosaccharides present are fucose, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. Due to this extensive glycosylation, mucins have a filamentous conformation, which is often negatively charged. This is believed to be important in forming a protective barrier to the cell. However, this property is a two-edged sword because when opposing cells have specific receptors for mucins, adhesion may become the predominant factor. 260 There are considerable regional variations in glycoprotein constituents in the gastrointestinal tract and these differences are probably related to physiological and functional factors. Furthermore, synthesis and secretion of glycoproteins alter with changes in cell differentiation. Alterations also occur in mucins in various inflammatory and neoplastic disease states as well as following administration of drugs and chemicals. 261 Gastrointestinal mucins are usually stained using PAS and alcian blue as well as the high iron diamine technique for sulfated mucins. Terminal sugars or sugar sequences can be demonstrated histochemically by the use of labeled lectins, mostly plant proteins which combine non-enzymatically with particular sugar molecules. 262\u00c0265 When gastrointestinal mucins were studied in several species using histochemical techniques under uniform conditions, species differences were most obvious in the stomach and duodenum. 256 Neutral mucins generally predominate in the stomach, contrasting with acid mucins in the small intestine and sulfated mucins in the colon. In the stomach, neutral mucins staining purple with the PAS/alcian blue stain predominate in the surface and foveolar mucosa, whereas mucous neck cells and antral glands contain acidic mucins that stain blue with PAS/alcian blue procedure. Sulfated mucins, which stain black with the high iron diamine technique, are also found in the deep glandular mucosa of the antrum in rats, mice and humans. 257, 266, 267 Extremely heterologous staining patterns are seen in the gastric mucosa with labeled lectins, each lectin staining different cell populations. 203, 268, 269 Non-neoplastic lesions Inflammation, erosions and ulceration of the gastric glandular mucosa",

            "text": "A variety of therapeutic agents produce gastric damage in humans. These include potassium chloride, iron salts, alendronate, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate), a cationic exchange resin, and above all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 170, 270 Low dose aspirin used in elderly patients to prevent cerebral and myocardial ischemia is also associated with gastrointestinal damage. 271, 272 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are some of the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide and peptic (gastric and upper small intestine) ulceration is one of their well-known adverse effects. 273 A systematic analysis of the published data suggested that one-third of patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for long periods develop upper gastrointestinal tract injury. 274 Serious injury is less common, although gastrointestinal bleeding following non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy is a significant cause of serious and sometimes fatal adverse drug reactions. 275\u00c0280 In one prospective study, gastrointestinal bleeding caused by these compounds accounted for 10% of those hospital admissions due to adverse drug reactions. 278 Predisposing factors in human patients with peptic ulceration include Helicobacter pylori infection of the antrum, cigarette smoking and alcohol use. 271, 281 Peptic-ulcer disease has been shown to be more common in Helicobacter pylori-infected patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs than in those without the infection, suggesting a possible interaction between drug use and this infection in the development of peptic ulcer. 274 Helicobacter pylori is a micro-aerophilic, Gram-negative organism that possesses potent urease activity crucial for its survival at acidic pH. Genome sequence analysis has shown that Helicobacter pylori has well-developed sequences for motility, scavenging iron and DNA restriction and modification systems used by bacteria to degrade foreign DNA. The link between Helicobacter pylori infection and peptic ulceration has been related to increases in gastrin release, perhaps through bacterial products or cytokines released from activated lymphocytes. 282 Although gastric pathology represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in humans following therapy with non-steroidal inflammatory agents, the mechanisms leading to injury are not fully understood. The theory that has gained widespread acceptance is that the ulcerogenic potential of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is related to their pharmacological activity. John Vane proposed that the ulcerogenic potential of these agents is largely a result of their ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthetase, thereby reducing the protective effects of prostaglandins. 283 By inhibiting cyclooxygenase these agents not only reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines but also prostaglandin synthesis. Indeed, there is a good correlation between time and dose dependency of induced suppression of gastrointestinal prostaglandin synthesis and potential for peptic ulceration. 284 Why this should lead to ulceration is less clear but it probably is a result of effects on several components of mucosal defense. Local irritancy of some formulations may be important and there may be alterations to the microcirculation, impairment of repair and changes in mucin or bicarbonate production. 273, 284 The discovery of two different cyclooxygenases led to the development of drugs that preferentially inhibited the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) isoform. This was based on the postulate that constitutively expressed cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) protects gastric mucosa whereas the inducible isoform COX-2 is responsible for inflammation and pain. While the benefit of selective COX-2 inhibitors for protection of the gastrointestinal tract is generally accepted, the situation turns out to be far more complex than originally envisaged. Many different mediators have been shown to contribute to the resistance of the gastrointestinal mucosa to injury. 273, 285 Indeed, in some circumstances COX-2 produces a highly potent gastro-protective substance 15-R-lipoxin A 4 . Moreover, one of the most dramatic pharmaceutical events over recent years has been the withdrawal from the marketplace of certain of these selective COX-2 inhibitors, e.g. Vioxxt (rofecoxib) and Bextrat (valdecoxib), because of concerns over their cardiovascular safety and skin effects which have been shown in major clinical trials. 286, 287 LABORATORY ANIMALS \u00c0 SPONTANEOUS CHANGES In laboratory animals in toxicity studies inflammatory changes in the mucosa as well as gastric erosions and ulcers in the glandular mucosa may be seen. Erosions represent mucosal breaks superficial to the muscularis mucosa (Figure 8.3a) . Ulcers are lesions that extend through the muscularis mucosa. While the histopathological features of gastric erosions and ulcers are themselves relatively non-specific, it is important to look for any associated pathology in the stomach such as mucus depletion, epithelial hyperplasia or dysplasia, intestinal metaplasia and vascular lesions (see below).",

            "text": "There is usually little that is histologically very specific about drug-induced ulceration of the gastric glandular mucosa, although morphological evidence of crystals, fragments of drug or other associated features may be helpful. Erosions and ulcers develop in laboratory animals following stress, reflux of intestinal contents and bile, changes in acid secretion and hypoxia, all of which may develop under the conditions occurring in high dose toxicity studies. The requirement to give the test compound in high doses may also dictate the need to administer exceedingly high concentrations of test agent which may simply damage the mucosa as a result of local irritancy in a manner not relevant to therapeutic doses used in clinical practice. For example, it has been demonstrated that oral administration of hyperosmolar solutions of quite innocuous substances such as glucose or sodium chloride can cause gastric inflammation, hemorrhage, erosions and ulcers of the rat gastric mucosa. 296, 297 Hyperosmolar solutions of sodium chloride have also been shown to induce increased expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes of CYP1A and CYP3A subtypes in the surface and foveolar cells of the gastric mucosa of rats, which could also modify the expression of xenobiotic activity. 297 The well-known association of gastric erosions and hemorrhage with uremia may also be manifest following administration of high doses of drugs such as diuretics which severely derange fluid and electrolyte balance. 19 Synergism between the ulcerogenic action of drugs and stress is also a well-described phenomenon. 298, 299 Protein depletion and starvation is also capable of inducing gastric ulceration in rats. 300 In laboratory animals, a variety of different patterns of drug-induced gastric damage have been described. A study of different anti-inflammatory drugs administered to fasted Sprague-Dawley rats under identical conditions suggested the drugs could be divided into three groups based on their profiles of gastrointestinal toxicity. 301 Immunological drugs and antiproliferative anticancer agents such as azathiaprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and d-penicillamine produced gastric mucosal hemorrhage whereas aspirin and related agents produced gastric mucosal hemorrhage and ulcers. The powerful non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacin and phenybutazone produced gastric mucosal erosion and ulcers as well as small intestinal damage. However, novel targeted therapies for treatment of cancer may not fall into these simple categories. For example, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor which produced single cell necrosis in the intestine in treated rats also produced cell damage (apoptosis) in the gastric glands of the fundus and pyloric regions most markedly in the basal zones and isthmus regions. 302 Comparative single oral dose studies of several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents at three different dose levels in the rat using histology evaluation and measurement of fecal blood loss with 51 Cr-labeled blood cells have also shown that different patterns of ulceration can be produced by different agents when administered under identical conditions. 303 Single oral doses of some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including aspirin produced widespread superficial damage and desquamation of gastric epithelium with little or no inflammation at six hours following dosing which completely healed two weeks later. This damage was associated with transient fecal blood loss. By contrast, indomethacin and ibuprofen produced both gastric damage and circumscribed, penetrating ulcers along the mesenteric border of the jejunum and ileum. Furthermore, ulcers were still present after two weeks and were associated with prolonged or biphasic blood loss. Pharmacokinetic factors may also be important. Lipid solubility in the low pH environment of the stomach may influence local penetration into the mucosa. 304 In addition, feeding conditions influence the distribution of erosions and ulcers in laboratory animals. In fasted rats, erosions due to indomethacin treatment are found in the body of the stomach while in conventionally fed rats they are most prominent in the small intestine. One detailed study showed that rats fed for one hour after a 24-hour fast and given a single dose of indomethacin within two hours of refeeding developed erosions and ulcers in the antrum primarily along the lesser curvature. Indomethacin given to fasted rats produced erosions in the body mucosa. 305 A further factor that needs to be kept in mind is that chronic administration of ulcerogenic compounds may produce quite different pathological appearances to those found following single dose administration. Administration of aspirin to rats for four weeks has been shown to stimulate epithelial proliferation of the gastric body but not antral mucosa, possibly by an effect on cyclic adenosine 3 0 ,5 0 monophosphate (cyclic AMP) or though increasing the rate of epithelial exfoliation. 306 Such a response may be the basis for increased resistance of the gastric mucosa to the chronic effects of these agents. It also may explain the tendency for ulcers to occur in the antrum following chronic administration of aspirin-like drugs as the proliferative response and presumably the adaptive potential appears less in this part of the gastric mucosa. A reactive proliferative change has also been described in humans treated with non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (see below).",

            "text": "Both interspecies variations and strain differences have been reported in the response to ulcerogenic compounds. Extravasation of red blood cells and greater vascular damage was observed in rats treated with aspirin or benoxprofen than in pigs given similar doses. 307 In animal pharmacology models, notably those using the rat, the COX-2 inhibitors have generally appeared to be less ulcerogenic than the conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, consistent with their reported effects in patients. 308\u00c0312 However, the simple concept that COX-1 inhibition causes gastrointestinal damage and selective COX-2 inhibition is not ulcerogenic has been clouded by a number of experimental observations. 313 For example, inhibition of COX-2 delays gastric ulcer healing through interference with cell proliferation, angiogenesis and maturation of granulation tissue. 314 Moreover, high dose toxicity studies revealed that COX-2 inhibitors can cause gastrointestinal ulceration. For example, rats, dogs and mice all developed gastric or pyloric ulceration when treated with the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, although the distal small intestine seemed to be more markedly affected. 315 It has been shown by immunocytochemistry that the distribution of COX-2 expression in interstitial cells (monocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells) of the lamina propria predominates in the distal ileum which has led to the suggestion that this might be a factor in the greater sensitivity of the ileum than the stomach to the ulcerogenic effects of COX-2 inhibition. 316 Diuretics and some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists have been associated with the development of gastric erosions and ulceration when administered in high doses to laboratory animals ( Figure 8 .3a). 19, 317 However, these effects appear related to the severe electrolyte disturbances produced by excessive doses of these drugs. This is perhaps analogous to the well-known association of gastrointestinal tract erosion and hemorrhage with uremia. Dogs appear predisposed. Microscopic examination may show that this form of ulceration is associated with deposition of basophilic ground substance and mineral in connective tissues and blood vessels in the mucosa. 318 The vascular damage which may occur in laboratory animals treated with high doses of cardioactive drugs such as the phosphodiesterase inhibitors may also occur in intramucosal blood vessels of the stomach and the inflammatory process can spill over into the glandular mucosa. 114 Infiltration of the stomach by lymphocytes in rats treated with human recombinant interleukin 2 without ulceration was reported as part of a multisystem involvement induced by this agent. 319 ",

Stress ulceration in the rat is accompanied by decreased sulfation of gastric glycoproteins. 320 Administration of aspirin and other anti-inflammatory agents including adrenocortical steroids to laboratory animals also reduces the content of sulfomucins in the gastric mucosa, probably by reducing their synthesis. 261 ,321\u00c0323 It has also been suggested that these agents modify phospholipids within the luminal aspects of the mucus gel layer which normally provides it with non-wettable properties, thereby reducing the protective hydrophobic barrier properties of the upper gastrointestinal tract. 324 Administration of histamine H 2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors that reduce gastric acid output and increases in gastrin secretion have also been associated with alterations in gastric mucus. Administration of omeprazole or famotidine to rats for four weeks was shown to inhibit prostaglandins PGE 2 as well as the synthesis of both total and sulfated glycoprotein along with histochemical evidence of reduction in PAS staining of the surface mucus. 325 Although the mechanism for this change is unclear, the reduction in mucus, particularly sulfated mucus that is believed to be particularly resistant to peptic digestion, may have implications for mucosal defense.",

Its significance is due to the fact that intestinal metaplasia is associated with the presence of gastric cancer. Although intestinal metaplasia is found much less commonly in laboratory animals, it has also been reported to occur in association with gastric neoplasia induced by polychlorinated biphenyls. 331 In view of this association with gastric cancer, it has been suggested that intestinal metaplasia represents a pre-neoplastic lesion.

            "text": "In humans, several forms of intestinal metaplasia have been described. These variants fall into two main groups, a so-called incomplete type and a complete form. 266 ,332\u00c0334 Others have proposed that it is best regarded in terms of gastric, intestinal and mixed phenotypes. 335 Complete intestinal metaplasia is characterized by the presence of goblet cells, Paneth cells and absorptive cells with brush borders and variably developed intestinal villi. Incomplete forms are more heterogeneous, characterized by goblet and mucous columnar cells but no absorptive cells and variable patterns of mucin. The routine alcian blue stain performed at pH 2.5 and periodic acid-Schiff stain distinguishes between the intestinal acid mucins (blue) and the neutral mucins of gastric type. However, variable sialomucin and sulfomucin staining patterns are also seen in intestinal metaplasia in humans if staining with the high iron-diamine/alcian blue stain is performed. The incomplete form of intestinal metaplasia, showing marked sulfomucin secretion, has been found more commonly in association with gastric cancer in people. 266, 332, 334 However, it is probable that intestinal metaplasia itself represents an adaptive response to long-standing chronic inflammation and reduced acid secretion. It has also been suggested that it represents an adaptive defensive response to long-standing Helicobacter pylori infection because intestinal mucosa is more resistant to these organisms. 336, 337 Immunocytochemical study has shown the presence of intestinal endocrine cells in the various forms of intestinal metaplasia that appears to follow the phenotype of the particular mucous cell differentiation. 335 Fischer 344 rats treated with the polychlorinated biphenyl Aroclor 1254, mixed in the diet for two years, developed foci of intestinal metaplasia in the stomach epithelium in association with gastric adenocarcinomas. 331, 338 These lesions were characterized by abundant mucin-containing cells with alkaline phosphatase activity typical of the small intestine. Similar, but more diffuse intestinal metaplasia was reported in the stomach of primates exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls, although this was not associated with gastric neoplasia. 339, 340 Intestinal metaplasia has also been inconsistently reported in the stomachs of laboratory animals treated with powerful genotoxic gastric carcinogens. For example, one study of rats treated with N-methyl-N 0 -nitro-N-nitroguanidine has demonstrated only hyperplasia and foci of atypical changes (dysplasia) with little or no intestinal metaplasia whereas another has shown intestinal metaplasia after administration of the same agent. 203, 258 Despite this link with carcinogen administration, intestinal metaplasia can be induced in rodents by a variety of different procedures that are not associated with the development of gastric cancer. Intestinal metaplasia can be induced in the glandular stomach of rodents by fractionated, localized, ionizing radiation, injection of xenogenic stomach antigens as well as propantheline bromide and the non-carcinogen iodoacetamine. 330,341\u00c0344 Intestinal metaplasia has also been shown to occur as part of the response to Helicobacter pylori infection in the small animal model, the Mongolian gerbil, as well as in C57BL mice infected with Helicobacter felis. 291, 292 The characteristics of intestinal metaplasia in laboratory rodents are similar to those seen in humans with early increases in intestinal enzyme activity (alkaline phosphatase, lactase, trehalase, sucrose and maltase), development of goblet cells containing neutral, sialo-, or sulfomucins, and intestinal crypts with or without Paneth cells. Both the fundus and antrum can show changes, although, as in humans, males appear more prone to develop intestinal metaplasia than females. 330 Based on these findings, it has been proposed that intestinal metaplasia is not a precancerous condition but an adaptive response to a chronic elevation in pH in gastric secretion due to the early loss of parietal cell mass brought about by these various procedures. 330 On balance therefore, the evidence suggests that although intestinal metaplasia is associated with cancer and may consequently be considered a helpful morphological feature in the evaluation of human gastric biopsies, the finding of isolated intestinal metaplasia in safety studies does not indicate a preneoplastic state.",

This is observed in humans and experimental animals following antrectomy because this removes the peptide-producing cells of the antrum. 351, 352 In the rat, antrectomy is accompanied by hypogastrinemia, reduced weight and height of the oxyntic mucosa and a reduced number of argyrophil cells. 238, 353 This is in contrast to procedures such as antral exclusion that lead to hypergastrinemia and increased thickness of the oxyntic mucosa.",

While all cell types are present, there is a most pronounced decrease in the numbers of parietal and enterochromaffin cells associated with an increase in surface mucous cells. These changes are linked to a profound decrease in acid secretion, which becomes unresponsive to histaminergic, cholinergic and gastrinergic stimulation. 247 Analogous atrophic changes have been reported following pharmacological removal of trophic stimuli. For instance, administration of the cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor antagonist CI-988 to cynomolgus monkeys for periods of up to 13 weeks was associated with an initial phase of multifocal degeneration of gastric glands primarily in the fundus followed by diffuse reduction in the thickness of the glandular mucosa with little or no qualitative changes to the cell populations. 354 Although bilateral vagotomy produces profound functional changes in the stomach, notably reduction of gastric acid secretion, morphological changes in the fundal mucosa are not marked either in experimental animals or in humans. 355, 356 Studies in the rat have shown that diffuse atrophy of the gastric glands characterized by a decrease in the number and size of parietal, chief and mucous cells occurs transiently following truncal vagotomy but histological features return to normal by about one month after surgery. 357 By contrast, unilateral vagotomy in the rat leads to marked and persistent atrophy of the oxyntic zone on the denervated side. This is characterized histologically by reduced height of the mucosa and reduced numbers and staining intensity of argyrophil cells. 358 It has been argued that this unilateral atrophy is due to the removal of the trophic action of the vagus. The lack of lasting atrophy after bilateral but not unilateral vagotomy has been explained by the subsequent rise in gastrin that occurs after bilateral vagotomy as a result of lack of acid feedback inhibition of gastrin release. 358 Removal or reduction in extra-gastric trophic factors or hormones may also reduce the thickness of the gastric mucosa. This has been demonstrated in the rat by hypophysectomy which causes a reduction in thickness of oxyntic and antral mucosa, compared with pair-fed controls. Although there was little or no change in peptic:parietal cell ratios, a significant decrease in cell volume and secretory activity of gastric glandular cells were demonstrated which suggested a widespread disturbance of synthesis and secretory mechanisms. 359 Atrophic changes in the chief cells were observed in rats treated for six months with high doses of omeprazole, an inhibitor of acid secretion. The findings were considered to represent disuse atrophy secondary to the inhibition of acid secretion. 360 Another inhibitor of gastric acid secretion, the tricyclic agent pirenzepin, also produced atrophy of the fundic mucosa of rats following three months but not one month of treatment. 361 The atrophy was characterized by reduction in parietal cell numbers associated with lower numbers of gastrin-containing cells in the antrum, features unlike those following prolonged treatment with histamine H 2 -receptor antagonists.",

The difficulty in making the distinction between an exuberant reactive hyperplasia from a dysplastic or premalignant change is an issue in all parts of the gastric glandular and intestinal mucosa particularly in the presence of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Moreover the effects of compounds such as colchicine and taxol that arrest mitosis through inhibition of tubulin polymerization into microtubules may mimic gastrointestinal dysplasia (Figure 8.3b) . 362\u00c0364 Like the mucosa of other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, the stimulus of high concentrations of bulky or irritant substances can cause hyperplasia of the stomach mucosa. An example of this in both rats and mice was observed following administration of high doses of poorly absorbed lanthanum carbonate used therapeutically as a phosphate binder in patients with compromised renal function. At high doses, rats and mice showed glandular hyperplasia of the stomach mucosa associated with submucosal chronic inflammation and hyperplasia of the squamous mucosa at the limiting ridge. 365 Cells of gastric glandular mucosa also undergo increases in size or number in response to the effects of gastrointestinal trophic hormones or their synthetic analogs. Similar changes also follow administration of compounds that inhibit gastric acid secretion or modify other trophic hormones or growth factors. Likewise transgenic hypergastrinemic mice also develop gastric mucosal hyperplasia. It has been shown in this model that cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) within interstitial cells contributes to the gastric hyperplasia. 366 When gastrin or its synthetic analog pentagastrin is administered subcutaneously to rats and mice for several weeks, there is an increase in both the number and size of parietal cells without concomitant increase in zymogenic chief cells. 367\u00c0369 In addition, diffuse hyperplasia of enterochromaffin cells also occurs. By contrast, cholecystokinin, a trophic peptide found in the duodenum and sharing the same C-terminal tetrapeptide sequence as gastrin, increases in the number of chief cells but not parietal cells when administered to mice under similar conditions. 369 Drugs, which inhibit or neutralize gastric acid secretion such as histamine H 2 -antagonists, proton pump inhibitors and antacids, also induce hypertrophy or hyperplasia of the parietal cell population. 242, 368 ,370\u00c0374 This occurs not only in laboratory animals treated with these drugs but also in humans. 170 These agents are associated with a rise in serum gastrin levels, probably as a result of loss of feedback inhibition of low antral pH on gastrin-producing G cells. Not all histamine H 2 antagonists produce identical effects. Other cytological changes have been reported with famotidine, another H 2 -receptor antagonist. This agent produced a dose-related increase in the prevalence and degree of eosinophilic granularity in chief cells of the stomach in toxicity studies in rats but not dogs. 375 Electron microscopy showed an increase in electron density of zymogen granules and it was argued that these effects were the result of secondary inhibition of pepsin secretion or turnover due to inhibition of acid secretion.",

Cystic change with chronic inflammation and foveolar hyperplasia is observed in biopsies taken from the edge of chronic gastric ulcers in humans. 378 Hyperplastic or cystic-type benign fundic polyps arise in 7\u00c010% of the patients taking proton pump inhibitors for 12 months or more but these regress with cessation of therapy. 379, 380 M\u00e9n\u00e9trier's disease (polyadenomes en nappes), a rare condition found primarily in middle-aged men, is also characterized by enlarged gastric folds, foveolar hyperplasia and glandular cystic dilation. 381\u00c0383 It is associated with decreased acid secretion, hypoproteinemia due to selective loss of serum proteins across the gastric mucosa and the development of gastric cancer. Although its pathogenesis remains elusive, increased expression of transforming growth factor \u03b1 (TGF\u03b1) and the epidermal growth factor receptor has been described. 384 TGF\u03b1 is an epithelial cell mitogen that inhibits gastric acid secretion and increases gastric mucin. Transgenic mice that over-express TGF\u03b1 in gastric mucosa develop a similar condition (see below) and it has been suggested that TGF\u03b1 might have an important role in this condition. 384 Mutant histamine H 2 receptor deficient mice also develop a similar condition which is associated with over-expression of TGF\u03b1. 385 As TGF\u03b1 is one of several ligands that bind to the epidermal growth factor receptor, it is of interest to note that treatment of patients with M\u00e9n\u00e9trier's disease with a monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor ameliorates the condition. 383 Similar changes have been observed in animals, even camels, sometimes in association with infestation of the gastrointestinal tract by parasites. 386\u00c0388 Laboratory rodents may develop a similar pattern of changes spontaneously with advancing age, although the cause of these changes remains uncertain. In rodents the distinction between this form of exuberant adenomatous hyperplasia and adenoma is not clear cut. However, it is customary in laboratory animal pathology to define adenomas as localized or focal proliferative lesions with well-ordered glandular patterns with a clear boundary with the surrounding normal mucosa. They are usually exophytic or polypoid in nature.",

The lamina propria also shows increased amounts of smooth muscle and collagen accompanied by variable numbers of lymphocytes and other chronic inflammatory cells.

Some glands are devoid of mucin; others show an increase in sulfomucin. 397 The etiology of the spontaneous condition in the mouse remains uncertain. It has been suggested that these features are similar to M\u00e9n\u00e9trier's disease in humans and might have a similar pathogenesis. 383, 384, 395 The occurrence of similar lesions in thymectomized mice has given rise to the suggestion that autoimmune damage to the gastric mucosa may be 364 8 . DIGESTIVE SYSTEM responsible. 398 The presence of circulating antiparietal antibodies and the decrease in the number of parietal cells in thymectomized mice suggested that autoimmune damage can occur to parietal cells with compensatory chronic stimulation and proliferation of the generative zones. 396 However, evidence from studies in female Han NMRI mice suggests that this proliferative condition can develop in mice in the absence of antiparietal antibodies but is associated with an increase in the number of antral gastrin cells, raising the possibility of a hormone or paracrine mechanism. 394 As a similar proliferative form of gastropathy has been reported in mice that overexpress transforming growth factor \u03b1 (TGF\u03b1), a potent mitogen and member of the epidermal growth factor family of peptides; it is possible that TGF\u03b1 is a key mediator in the development of this condition. TGF\u03b1 acts by binding to and activating the tyrosine kinase of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Transgenic mice over-expressing TGF\u03b1 develop severe adenomatous and cystic hyperplasia of the gastric glandular mucosa starting from about two months of age along with loss of mature parietal cell numbers and a diminution in gastric acid production. 395 The degree of change was to shown to be somewhat dependent on the genetic background of the mouse.",

Like the spontaneous condition, these changes were characterized by thickening of the mucosa by hyperplasia of the foveolar and neck regions, and downward proliferation of glandular elements into gastric glands. 242 Similar glandular hyperplasia in the mouse stomach alongside neuroendocrine alterations has been associated with histamine H 2 blockade with the agent ioxtidine. 392 Adenomatous polyps have also been reported in the pyloric antrum of C57Bl/10J mice treated for 52 weeks with the synthetic progestin cyproterone acetate. 399 These were single, pedunculated and well-differentiated lesions showing little evidence of dysplasia. The mechanism for the induction of these polyps is unclear although they may have been hormonally mediated as both progesterone and estrogen receptors have been identified at low levels in gastric tissue. 400 However, similar glandular polyps have also been described in male but not female mice following oral administration lanthanum carbonate for up to 99 weeks at a dose of 1.3 times the maximum recommended daily dose in renal compromised patients to bind phosphate. 401, 402 However, lanthanum carbonate is particularly inert, poorly soluble and not well absorbed suggesting that the polyps may also develop as a response to local mechanical factors.",

Female Sprague-Dawley rats given 250 mg/kg of aspirin in 1% methylcellulose once daily orally by gavage for six months followed for periods of up to 18 months without treatment developed focal proliferative changes at the sites of healed ulcers, mainly in the mucosa of antrum or antral-body junction. 404 These lesions were characterized by the presence of proliferating gastric glands lined by columnar, cuboidal or flattened epithelial cells in the mucosa, which also extended through the muscularis mucosa. Mucus content of these glands was variable but when present was principally acidic in type, as shown by staining with alcian blue at pH 2.5. The lesions were accompanied by increased collagen in the lamina propria, endarteritis and an infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells and mast cells. The lesions were not associated with the development of carcinoma following 18 months' observation and it is probable that they were the result of the chronic damage and repair induced by aspirin treatment.",

Some atypical glands penetrated the muscularis mucosae. Dysplastic lesions situated primarily in the pyloric region were also associated with the development of invasive carcinoma in some rats. Extensive histological sectioning of the stomach in rats treated with tiotidine for only six months also revealed evidence of early proliferative changes. Therefore, these lesions produced by tiotidine possessed more in common with those induced by powerful carcinogens such as N-methyl-N 0 -nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine than the benign, species-specific proliferative change of little or no relevance for human safety. Interestingly, mice treated for 18 months with tiotidine were devoid of dysplastic changes in the gastric mucosa. 408 Certain compounds may produce changes that mimic gastrointestinal dysplasia. This has been well described in human gastric biopsies in patients being treated with compounds such as colchicine and taxol that interfere with tubulin and inhibit its polymerization into microtubules. 362\u00c0364 This effect produces mitotic arrest characterized by prominent ring mitoses associated with epithelial pseudostratification, loss of polarity and increased apoptosis, features that may mimic true dysplasia. Similar features have also been reported in laboratory animals (Figure 8.3b) . 363, 409, 410 Hyperplasia and neoplasia of gastric endocrine cells, carcinoid tumors One of the most remarkable examples of drug-induced gastric alterations reported in rodent bioassays has been the hyperplasia of enterochromaffin cells and development of carcinoid-like neoplasms in the stomach of rats treated with omeprazole. 411, 412 Omeprazole is a substituted benzimidazole which inhibits gastric acid secretion by blocking the enzyme H1 , K1 -ATPase, the proton pump of the parietal cells. 413 At that time, now 30 years ago, there was much concern about the findings in the rat and their potential implications for humans. Similar findings have now been reported with other drugs of the same type so it has become to be regarded widely as a class effect. 414\u00c0416 These proton pump inhibitors have been extensively used safely for many years. There is a mild hypergastrinemia and gastric biopsies in long-term clinical trials in humans have suggested an increased incidence enterochromaffin hyperplasia with prolonged dosing. However, the evidence for enterochromaffin hyperplasia is not convincing. 379, 380 Only benign fundic glandular polyps have been convincing related to treatment with proton pump inhibitors and these regress with cessation of therapy. 379, 380 Carcinoid tumors, dysplasia or gastric carcinomas have rarely been detected. 414 Even when hypergastrinemia is marked and prolonged, such as in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, gastric carcinoids are rare. Thus, these rodent findings are widely understood to be an effect of exaggerated pharmacodynamic activity not directly relevant to the therapeutic use of these drugs.",

            "text": "As a result of the treatment-related increases of these normally rare gastric carcinoids in the rat bioassay with omeprazole, clinical trials with this agent were suspended until it was agreed that the endocrine alterations were a result of prolonged drug-induced achlorhydria. It was postulated that omeprazole causes a prolonged inhibition of acid secretion in the rat which causes activation, and subsequently hyperplasia of antral gastrin cells and marked hypergastrinemia. Hypergastrinemia in turn stimulates enterochromaffin cells of the fundus, which in time results in enterochromaffin hyperplasia. 238 This argument is supported by the fact that similar morphological findings are reported in chronic atrophic gastritis and other achlorhydric sites in humans and that antrectomy in the rat prevents the appearance of enterochromaffin hyperplasia following treatment with omeprazole. 420\u00c0422 Although mild dose-related gastric argyrophil cell hyperplasia was noted in dogs treated with omeprazole for one year, neoplasms of the stomach were not observed during this time period. Why mice developed neither argyrophil hyperplasia nor gastric carcinoids with a similar treatment regimen is not clear, as the mechanism of action of omeprazole is similar in rat, dog and mouse. However, as the duration of action of omeprazole was shorter in the mouse, it was postulated that sustained inhibition of gastric acid secretion over 24 hours is necessary to activate increased gastrin secretion from antral cells. 411 It has also been suggested that the mouse possesses fewer gastric enterochromaffin cells than the rat and shows a much lower serum gastrin response to omeprazole treatment. 412 Nevertheless, gastric neuroendocrine tumors have occasionally been reported to develop spontaneously in old laboratory mice where they can be an issue in carcinogenicity studies because of their association with raised gastrin levels. 423 Duration of action or potency may also be the explanation for the lack of reports of carcinoid neoplasms in rats following inhibition of gastric acid secretion by the histamine H 2 receptor blockers cimetidine and ranitidine. Neither of these drugs completely inhibits gastric acid secretion in the rat for 24 hours. 422, 424 However, while neoplasia has not been reported, mild gastric neuroendocrine hyperplasia has been described in cimetidine-treated rats. 425 Moreover, the long-acting H 2 receptor antagonist SK&F 93479 produced gastric carcinoid neoplasms when administered at a high dose (1,000 mg/kg) to rats for two years (Figure 8 .5). 242, 393 Although this dose level of SK&F 93479 did not entirely suppress gastric acid secretion and control gastric pH over 24 hours, plasma gastrin levels remained elevated at three to four times control values over this period. In a 21-month oral carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice at the same dose level (1,000 mg/kg), a diffuse neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia and multifocal glandular hyperplasia and neoplasia was also observed. 242, 393 Similarly, loxitidine, a potent, non-competitive, insurmountable histamine H 2 antagonist, 370 8 . DIGESTIVE SYSTEM produced hyperplasia of neuroendocrine cells and carcinoid tumors in the gastric fundus of both rats and mice after two years' treatment in diet and drinking water, respectively. 392, 426 Other histamine antagonists, BL-6341 and ICI 162846, have been reported to produce neuroendocrine neoplasms in the stomach of rats and rats and mice, respectively. 408, 425 Drugs of other classes also cause hyperplasia of gastrin-containing cells. Immunocytochemical study using antigastrin antibody revealed increased gastrin cell numbers in the antral mucosa of dogs given high doses of adrenocorticosteroids for four weeks and these changes were accompanied by enhanced serum and tissue gastrin levels. 427 These results suggest that corticosteroids have a trophic effect on gastrincontaining cells.",

For instance, piperazine, a cyclic secondary amine widely used as an antihelminthic drug, has been shown to form small quantities of N-mononitrosopiperazine in the human stomach measured by gas chromatography-thermal energy analysis. 434 The possibility of nitrosation is not usually taken into account in the testing of carcinogenic potential of novel drugs as bioassays are usually only performed with parent compound. However, concerns about nitrosation have arisen in subsequent clinical practice. An example of this was the proposal that a few gastric cancers found in patients while being treated with the histamine H 2 receptor antagonist cimetidine were the result of treatment. 435\u00c0437 It now seems likely that all those observed cancers associated with cimetidine were incidental. 438 However, at that time concerns were increased by the theoretical possibility that cimetidine has the potential to be nitrosated in vivo. 435 A further factor was the concept that the treatment-induced gastric secretory inhibition with subsequent bacterial colonization of the stomach rendered the conditions conducive to the generation of N-nitroso compounds from normal dietary constituents. 436, 438 All these concerns appear to be unfounded. Long-term surveillance studies with cimetidine have shown no causal link between its clinical usage and gastric malignancy. 439, 440 In addition, carcinogenicity bioassays performed with cimetidine, cimetidine plus nitrite and nitrosocimetidine have not shown any tumorigenic effect in the gastric mucosa. 441 A seven-year study in dogs in which multiple gastric biopsies were taken at intervals of approximately six months has also shown no indication of gastric hyperplasia, dysplasia, intestinal metaplasia or neoplastic change. 442 Although complacency is certainly not warranted with respect to the nitrosation of therapeutic agents in vivo, the risks of development of gastric malignancy from such drugs when administered on a short-term basis are probably very small. 443 Even for gastric antisecretory agents administered for longer periods of time, the balanced view would also permit development of novel agents provided they are not obviously mutagenic or carcinogenic in the usual preclinical studies and are not particularly liable to undergo rapid nitrosation.",

Some retain the old criteria of Stewart and co-workers who defined invasive cancer as a neoplastic growth reaching the serosa. 446 It is now considered more appropriate to apply criteria of use in human diagnostic pathology. Unequivocal invasion of the submucosa is sufficient evidence of an invasive and therefore malignant process. However, it is very important to make the distinction between invasive adenocarcinoma from penetrating hyperplasic but non-neoplastic gastric glands that occurs quite commonly in rodents, particularly mice. These hyperplastic lesions do not show dysplastic features: glands are not 'back to back', nuclei are not stratified, the nuclear\u00c0cytoplasmic ratio is not overly increased and there is no loss of cellular and nuclear polarity.",

In mice CYP3A appears to be the principal subfamily present, similar to the human small intestine. 451 Likewise in the beagle dog, CYP3A is the most abundant P450 expressed in small intestine predominantly in mature epithelial cells in the upper villus mostly in the duodenum and jejunum but less in the terminal ileum. 452 Gene expression data from the rat suggest that there is strong expression of CYP2C in this species. 453 It has been demonstrated in the rat that the concentration of cytochrome P450 and drug metabolizing enzyme activity also increases in intestinal epithelial cells as they move from crypt to villous tips. 450, 454 As in the liver, the activity of cytochrome P450 can be induced or inhibited by drugs. 451, 452 The phenobarbitone-inducible form of cytochrome P450 which normally represents less than 5% of total P450 in the small bowel can be increased to about 50% of total cytochrome P450 in small intestine cells with phenobarbitone treatment. Furthermore, it has been shown that drug metabolizing activity in the tips of the villi in the duodenum is greater in rats fed a conventional diet than a semi-synthetic diet and that the activity depends critically on the absorption of iron from the intestine. 454 Glutathione is also present throughout the entire mucosa. In rats, cells at the tips of the villi contain less glutathione than cells located more basally, whereas related enzymes \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase and glutathione-S-transferase show highest activity in the villous tip region. 455 The fact that these enzyme activities are highest in the duodenum and lowest in the terminal ileum suggests that detoxification systems for exogenous compounds are greater in the proximal small intestine.",

Enteric epithelium possesses the fastest rate of turnover of any tissue exceeded only by a few rapidly growing neoplasms. 456, 457 In normal circumstances, the constant turnover of small bowel mucosa is maintained by equilibrium between cell production in the crypts and cell loss at the tips of the villi. Exogenous substances, intraluminal secretions, mechanical and neural factors as well as alterations in blood flow all possess potential to influence mucosal cell kinetics. 456, 457 All main epithelial cell types are believed to arise from undifferentiated columnar cells at the crypt base although mucous cells may also arise by proliferation of partly differentiated mucous cells in the crypts. 458 The cells in the crypts have high activities of enzymes such as thymidine kinase that are involved in nucleic acid synthesis. 459 The complete cell cycle lasts about 10 to 17 hours in rodents and at least 24 hours in humans. Enteric epithelium is completely replaced within two to three days in mice and rats and within three to six days in humans. 456, 457 After two or more divisions in the crypt cells migrate to the villus, lose ability to incorporate thymidine and differentiate into mature cells equipped with enzymes associated with nutrient absorption. 459 Cell migration in the rat is completed more rapidly in the ileum than in the jejunum principally as a result of the lower villous height in the ileum. 460 Migration terminates by loss of cells from the tip of the villi. Surrounding the crypt is a sheath of fibroblastic cells. These cells also undergo synchronous division and migration with the epithelial cells, maintaining the intimate relationship between the epithelium and supporting tissues. 461 Mature absorptive cells are important in the active and passive transport of nutrients as well as in the endocytosis of macromolecules. They are characterized by the presence of a striated or brush border which is seen in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections as a refractive bi-laminar band. The inner, wider lamina corresponds to the microvillous region that is associated with the presence of neutral mucins in most species. The outer, thinner band corresponds to the glycocalyx, which is composed principally of acidic mucosubstances. 256 This outer band of the brush border shows histochemical staining predominantly for sulfomucins in most species including mouse, hamster, dog and rhesus monkey, although in the duodenum of the rats and in the entire human small bowel sialomucins predominate in this layer. Electron microscopy of the absorptive cells shows that the surface of absorptive cells is covered by tightly packed and well-developed microvilli approximately 1 \u03bcm long and 0.1 \u03bcm wide.

            "text": "An important aspect of the absorptive cell membrane is its high concentration of disaccharidases such as sucrase, maltase and lactase, related to the absorption of sugars. Alkaline phosphatase activity is also abundant on the surface of absorptive cells. Immunocytochemical demonstration of alkaline phosphatase can be used as a tool to examine the effects of xenobiotics on intrinsic membrane glycoproteins in the small intestine. 462 Enterokinase, the glycoprotein enzyme, which initiates the activation of pancreatic zymogens by converting trypsinogen to trypsin, is also present in the brush border and glycocalyx of the small intestinal epithelium, both in humans and animals. Immunocytochemical studies have demonstrated that in humans this enzyme is located in the duodenum and proximal jejunum but not ileum, colon and stomach. 463 Goblet cells are much fewer in number than absorptive cells in the small intestine but they increase in number from the duodenum to the lower ileum. They are important in the production of mucus, which remains on the surface of the mucosa as a viscous layer and acts as the first line of defense against intestinal pathogens. Goblet cells are characterized by the presence of abundant mucous droplets formed by the Golgi complex which accumulate in the apical part of the cell cytoplasm. Histochemical study shows that neutral mucins are present in the goblet cells found in crypts and on the villi in the entire small bowel mucosa of most species including humans but there is an interspecies variation in the population of sialo-and sulfomucins. 256 In the mouse, sulfomucins predominate but among rats considerable individual variation in the proportion of sialo-and sulfomucins is reported. In the hamster, sulfomucins are more prominent in the proximal and sialomucins in the distal small bowel. In the dog, both sulfomucins and sialomucins are found with predominance of one or other in individual animals. Staining for acidic mucins is less intense in the goblet cells of the small intestine in humans compared with non-human primates but sialomucins are predominant in both species.",

            "text": "Paneth cells are located near the crypt base throughout the small intestine in rodents and humans but typically not in carnivores such as dog and cat. 464\u00c0466 They are characterized by the presence of numerous eosinophilic cytoplasmic secretory granules between about 1.0 and 2 \u03bcm diameter that contain various enzymes and mucosubstances. Particular care is needed in fixation and staining for optimal demonstration of Paneth cells for they rapidly degranulate after death and granules are destroyed by acetic acid fixation. Formalin and mercuric fixatives appear appropriate methods and they permit staining with methylene blue, Lendrum's phloxine-tartrazine and Masson's trichrome. 467 The apical parts of Paneth cells show glucose-6-phosphatase, carbonic anhydrase and monoamine oxidase activity and they have been shown to contain lysozyme and immunoglobulins, particularly IgA. 465,468\u00c0470 The Paneth cell granules also contain antimicrobial peptides such as secretory phospholipid A 2 , \u03b1 defensins also called cryptins. These are believed to possess not only antimicrobiol activity but are also important in the regulation of cell volume, chemotaxis, mitogenesis and inhibition of natural killer cell activity. 471\u00c0474 Studies of transgenic and knockout mice have supported a pivotal role of Paneth cell defensins in protection from oral bacterial pathogens. Other observations suggest that Paneth cell dysfunction may contribute to the clinical manifestations of Crohn's disease and necrotizing enterocolitis in humans. 474 Endocrine cells are also scattered throughout the small intestinal mucosa. They are of both argentaffin and argyrophil types and are situated predominantly in crypts. Immunocytochemical study shows that they contain a variety of different peptides although gastrin, secretion and serotonin-containing cells have been those most extensively studied. 475 In addition to the barrier formed by mucus and epithelial cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and mast cells also form part of the protective function of the small intestine. Some lymphocytes are located within the epithelium mostly above the basal lamina but below epithelial nuclei. 476 These lymphocytes are termed intraepithelial lymphocytes and are predominantly of T suppresser/cytotoxic type in humans and laboratory animals. 476, 477 Most lymphocytes in the lamina propria are also T cells but T helper (CD4 positive) cells outnumber the T suppresser/cytotoxic (CD8 positive) phenotype. 476, 478, 479 Many plasma cells present in the lamina propria produce IgA, the major immunoglobulin of mucosal secretions representing another important component of the mucosal barrier. 480, 481 Morphometric analysis of IgA-containing immunocytes in the rat ileal mucosa using immunocytochemical staining has shown that the number of these cells varies with alterations in the microbiological status of intestinal contents. 482 Peyer's patches are prominent aggregates of lymphoid tissue in the gastrointestinal tract and constitute important sites at which antigens from the gut lumen encounter immune competent cells which are responsible for the initiation of immune responses. 483 Peyer's patches are located on the ante-mesenteric wall of the small bowel and consist principally of collections of lymphoid follicles. In humans, Peyer's patches are more common in the ileum but in mice they are more uniformly distributed. 484, 485 In rats the number of patches is more common distally. 486 The number of follicles within individual patches usually varies from two to six but there are strain differences. They may show considerable variation in size between individual animals. 487 A comparative study showed that in Fischer 344 rats they are smaller than those in Wistar rats. 479 Particular care in selection and orientation of tissue blocks is therefore essential for any form of critical assessment of Peyer's patches. In Peyer's patches lymphoid follicles are surrounded by a corona of small lymphocytes principally of B cell type. The interfollicular area contains post-capillary venules and T lymphocytes. 486, 488, 489 The epithelium overlying the Peyer's patch follicles (dome area) contains specialized epithelial cells, called microfold, membranous or simply M cells. These cells have been identified in many species including rats, mice, hamsters, dogs, monkeys and humans. 490, 491 These cells differ functionally from other enterocytes by their ability to transport large molecules such as ferritin and horseradish peroxidase and particulate matter from the lumen to the underlying lymphoid tissue. 492, 493 They have also been shown to be the site of penetration of reoviruses into the epithelium and they can transport Vibrio cholerae and other organisms. 491, 494 M cells therefore form points in the intestinal wall which transport intact antigen and macromolecules to the follicles where they can be processed and be transported to lymph nodes with consequent IgA immune responses. This contrasts with the uptake of soluble antigens, which can be taken up by ordinary epithelial cells and transported in the circulation of the villi to be ultimately trapped in the spleen, possibly to evoke an IgM/IgG response. 493 Understanding of these cellular and molecular characteristics is critical for the design of mucosal vaccines for pathogens that exploit this pathway. 495 Mucosal mast cells also appear to be involved in the immunological defense of the gastrointestinal tract. They respond by proliferation, migration and discharge of granules during nematode infestations. 496 It has been shown in the rat that mucosal mast cells of the gut differ in several ways from connective tissue mast cells. These differences result in poor preservation of mast cells of the gut if the usual metachromatic staining techniques are employed for the demonstration of mast cells in tissue sections. 497 Histochemical study suggests that mucosal mast cells differ from connective tissue mast cells by a lower degree of sulfation of glycosaminoglycans and different spatial relationships of protein and glycosaminoglycans in their granules. These cross-link following formalin fixation to prohibit cationic dye binding and prevent histological staining. However, staining can be achieved in tissues fixed in formalin by prolonged incubation in toluidine blue (5\u00c07 days), a procedure which allows adequate penetration of the toluidine blue molecule. 497 ",

Erosions, ulcers and strictures have been associated with a number of therapeutic agents in people. 170 Antimitotic or radiomimetic agents as well as ionizing radiation are liable to adversely affect the rapidly dividing cells of the small intestine with resulting breakdown of the mucosal barrier. Newer targeted anticancer drugs have also been associated with intestinal damage. 3 The ulcerogenic activity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is also expressed in the small bowel mucosa, most commonly in the distal ileum. Moreover, different agents also act in synergy to enhance damage to the small bowel mucosa. Important examples are drugs that depress the immune system or antimicrobial agents that permit the development of pathological infections by microorganisms of the opportunistic type in the small intestine. Vasoconstriction may also result in intestinal ulceration. For example, life-threatening gastrointestinal ulceration is reported as a result of cocaine abuse. Although gastrointestinal complications are less common than cardiac damage, cocaine abuse may induce mesenteric ischemia as a result of vasoconstriction leading to gastric or intestinal ulceration and perforation of the entire wall. 501, 502 It appears that the abuse of the free base form of cocaine (crack) is more liable to produce more upper gastrointestinal intestinal damage than oral cocaine abuse which tends to induce more distal intestinal perforation. Although the exact mechanism leading to intestinal ischemia is not certain, cocaine blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine (noradrenalin) which is believed to be the cause of mesenteric vasoconstriction and ischemia.",

This organism was first recognized in the gastric glands of mice by Tyzzer in 1907 and has since been confirmed as a cause of diarrhea in animals and as a human pathogen. It causes mild diarrhea in normal subjects especially children and young adults but it can produce severe intestinal disease in immunocompromised individuals. 522 Histological examination of the small intestine of laboratory animals infested by cryptosporidium reveals the presence of organisms attached to the mucosal surface, often associated, as in humans, with other parasites or infections. They are rounded, weakly basophilic structures 1\u00c04 \u03bcm diameter in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections but are strongly basophilic following Romanowsky staining. Transmission electron microscopy reveals the detailed internal structure of cryptosporidium attached to the microvillous surface of the epithelial cells. The various stages in the life cycle have been visualized by light and electron microscopy. Infection starts with ingestion of an oocyst containing four sporozoites, which are probably released by the action of digestive enzymes. These attach themselves to the intestinal mucosa and undertake their life cycle attached to the epithelial cells. These organisms have been demonstrated in most laboratory species including mice, hamsters, rabbits, dogs and monkeys. 504,523\u00c0526",

Following administration of aspirin to mice for several weeks, shortening and erosion of microvilli and increased numbers of goblet cells were demonstrated in the duodenum and jejunum by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. 537, 538 Morphometric studies of the intestinal mucosa of indomethacin-treated mice have also shown widespread alterations to columnar cells, goblet cells and Paneth cells suggesting generalized effects on mitotic activity and crypt loss. 539 Although non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs are the best-known drugs with adverse effects on gastrointestinal mucosa, small intestinal inflammation and ulceration can also be produced by other drugs through different mechanisms. Antimitotic anticancer drugs, high doses of antiviral drugs that depress cell proliferation and immunosuppressive agents may also produce intestinal mucosal apoptosis, necrosis, hemorrhage, inflammation and opportunistic gastrointestinal overgrowth when administered to dogs or rodents in high doses (Figure 8.7) . 540\u00c0545 Drugs include the older anticancer drugs of diverse structural and pharmacological types as well as new antimitotic agents and so-called 'targeted' anticancer therapies such as those acting on vascular endothelial growth factor or microtubules. 3 Acute disruption of the upper small intestinal mucosa is considered to be an important factor in the development of nausea and vomiting during anticancer therapy. Chemotherapy is believed to induce free radicals formation leading to localized exocytotic release of 5-hydroxytryptamine from the enterochromaffin cells which interacts with 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptors on vagal afferent terminals in the wall of the bowel. These link to the dorsal brain stem and the area postrema to produce nausea and vomiting. 546 Particularly well studied in human patients and laboratory animals have been the effects of methotrexate on the small intestinal mucosa. 547, 548 It induces loss of crypts, crypt and villus atrophy and flattening of epithelial cells as a consequence of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation. However, treatment seems to spare goblet cells and Paneth cells as well as the epithelium associated with Peyer's patches. 549 Colchicine and the anticancer drug taxol (paclitaxel), which interfere with tubulin and inhibit its polymerization into microtubules, have also been reported to produce intestinal damage. 362\u00c0364 This effect produces mitotic arrest characterized by large pleomorphic nuclei, prominent ring mitoses associated with epithelial pseudostratification, loss of polarity and increased apoptosis, features that may mimic true premalignant changes (dysplasia). Similar features also occur in laboratory animals (Figure 8 .3b). 363, 409, 410 Antiviral drugs may also show radiomimetic effects on the gastrointestinal mucosa such as seen in dogs treated with high doses of acyclovir. 176 There are also reports of experimental drugs of other therapeutic classes also producing intestinal damage as a result of their generalized antimitotic effects. 550 The small intestine is very radiosensitive and changes are seen in patients after ionizing radiation therapy. The terminal ileum appears to be more sensitive by virtue of its being a more fixed structure than the other parts of the intestine. 551 Three stages of damage are described. There is an acute phase characterized by hyperemia, edema and inflammation, crypt abscesses and ulceration, a subacute phase two to 12 months after radiation where there is partial tissue repair but with varying degrees of arteriolar sclerosis and a chronic phase where progressive fibrosis occurs. 552\u00c0554 Whereas the acute epithelial alterations resemble changes following administration of antiproliferative anticancer drugs, ionizing radiation is typically associated with a fibrous thickening of blood vessel walls, not normally seen after drug therapy.",

Although these different agents influence gastric acid secretion in different ways, structure\u00c0activity relationships suggest that they produce duodenal dysmotility, decrease bicarbonate production and reduce its delivery from the distal to proximal duodenum. These factors decrease the neutralization of gastric acid in the first part of the duodenum which may contribute to the development of ulceration. 555 Furthermore, these effects can be attenuated or prevented by dopamine agonists or their precursors whereas dopamine antagonists can potentiate their effects suggesting dopamine-mediated actions of these agents may be involved in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulceration. 556, 557 Fatty change (lipidosis)",

Electron microscopic examination revealed uniform electron-lucent droplets within profiles of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Lipid droplets increased with time and accumulated to form large droplets in the lamina propria. Larger droplets were phagocytosed by macrophages in the lamina propria but there was no evidence of epithelial damage or necrosis. Changes were most pronounced in the duodenum but were also noted to a lesser extent in jejunum and ileum but not in colon or stomach. Sequential studies using electron microscopy showed that lipid rapidly accumulated within several hours in the profiles of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of the epithelial cells and formed droplets or chylomicra in the intercellular space. The absence of any other subcellular changes or evidence of derangement of protein synthesis suggested that Sa H51-055 altered the pathways of lipid resynthesis or transport. This was consistent with the distribution of the lipid in the upper third of the jejunal villous epithelium, a zone reported to be most active in lipid absorption, resynthesis and transport. 559 It was suggested that fatty change might have taken place because of alterations in the sugar moiety of chylomicra brought about by interference with glucose transport.",

Species differences in susceptibility and tissue distribution of phospholipid are probably of diverse origin. They are related not only to physiochemical characteristics of the inducing drugs which influence their ability to permeate selective biomembranes and react with different lipids but also to local tissue concentrations of drugs and the ability of particular organs to metabolize parent drug to less amphiphilic products.

Although its adverse effects in patients have been linked to accumulation of drug in lysosomes, particularly in liver, skin and eye, toxicity does not appear to be a direct result of the accumulation of phospholipids. After high doses of amiodarone were administered orally to rats and beagle dogs, multilamellar lysosomal inclusion bodies accumulated first in the jejunal mucosa and mesenteric lymph nodes before becoming widely distributed in other organs, particularly in the lungs. 565 In both rats and dogs the small intestinal lesions were characterized by the presence of foamy macrophages with pale finely vacuolated cytoplasm and condensed eccentric nuclei within the lamina propria of the jejunal villi. Mesenteric lymph nodes were also involved early after the onset of treatment. In the dog, jejunal villi were somewhat flattened and widened or showed a variable degree of villous atrophy, most marked in the proximal and middle jejunum. 566 Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of lamellar lysosomal bodies distending macrophages.",

In addition, vacuolated lipid-laden epithelial cells were observed over the tips of villi accompanied by reductions in the numbers of goblet cells and reduced activity of acid and alkaline phosphatase, esterase, adenosine triphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphatase and succinic dehydrogenase, compatible with a direct adverse effect on superficial mature epithelial cells.",

            "text": "The compensatory response to the surgically resected or bypassed intestine has been the focus of the most detailed studies of cell renewal in the small intestine. Partial resection in both rats and humans is accompanied by increased villous height and crypt length. 578, 579 This is primarily the result of hyperplasia for it has been shown that the numbers of cells per unit length of villus remains unchanged but there is an overall increase in the cell population of villus and crypt. DNA/RNA ratios remain largely unaltered. 457 No gross changes in villous shape have been reported after resection and the total number of crypts remains constant. Although increased intestinal uptake of substances from the bowel lumen occurs in hypertrophied segments per unit length of bowel, disaccharide and dipeptidase activities are normal or even decreased after resection suggesting a comparative immaturity of cells in the residual mucosa. Functional adaptation therefore is largely achieved by a larger number of cells but their individual absorptive capacity is not increased. 457 Increased numbers of specific goblet cell populations are also seen in hyperfunctional states. Following jejuno-ileal bypass operations in rats, increased numbers of PAS-positive goblet cells develop in the villi and crypts of the hyperfunctional segments of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. 580 Mucin histochemistry has shown that the goblet cells in the hyperfunctional segments contain increased sialomucins in the villi and crypts of the jejunum and ileum but not in the duodenum and increased sulfomucins in the distal ileal segment. As sialic acid conveys more viscoelastic properties to mucin, it has been suggested that the goblet cells change following intestinal bypass and fulfill a protective function against the increased flow of gastrointestinal contents. 580 Interestingly partial hepatectomy (70%) of rats has also been shown to produce persistent trophic changes in the proximal jejunum characterized by thickening of the jejunal wall and villous hypertrophy. 581 A number of nutritional factors, particularly dietary fiber, have been shown to influence the proliferative characteristics of the small bowel mucosa. Carefully controlled studies in rats given different forms of dietary fiber have shown that the proliferative characteristics of the small intestine can be modified by both the quantity and the precise nature of the fiber. These different effects may be the result of differences in solubility, gel formation, water holding capacity, effect on transit time and ion exchange activity or bile acid adsorption of the different fibers. However, interactions between dietary constituents are complex. For instance, the histological effects in the rat small intestine after administration of 2% dietary cholestyramine, a non-absorbable ion exchange resin, has been shown to depend on interaction with other dietary factors. 582 Administration of an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, 5\u03b1-cholest-8-(14)-en-3\u03b2-ol-15one, to rats for up to nine days was also shown to produce enlargement of the small intestine in a way which was morphologically similar to the changes found following intestinal bypass. 583 The enlargement was most marked in the proximal segment of the small intestine and progressively diminished towards the ileo-cecal junction, sparing the stomach, cecum and colon. Histological examination and morphometric analysis revealed an increase in smooth muscle mass, lengthening of the villi as well as an increase in the depth and cellular proliferation in the crypts of Lieberk\u00fc hn without evidence of cell damage or fatty change. Like the changes following jejunal bypass procedures, there was also an increase in acid mucosubstances in the goblet cell population overlying the villous mucosa. The mechanism for this change in the rat was unclear, particularly as intestinal hyperplasia was not seen in baboons treated with this 15-ketosterol for long periods. However, it was suggested that it was an adaptive response, possibly related to inhibition of cholesterol metabolism and cholesterol absorption from the diet as the laboratory diet employed in the rat study was particularly low in cholesterol.",

This was characterized by an increase in villous length and deepening of intestinal glands, with a relatively unchanged number of epithelial cells per unit length of gland or villus. 149 Although prostaglandin E analogs produce most of their effects in the stomach, increased thickness of the small intestine characterized by longer villi, deeper crypts and increase in cell size have been reported in rats treated with these agents. 196 Focal hyperplasia, focal avillous hyperplasia, focal atypical hyperplasia, duodenal plaque, polypoid hyperplasia, polyp \u00c0 mouse Irregular, atypical single or multiple foci of glandular hyperplasia may be found in the small intestinal mucosa of several strains of aged, untreated mice.

The proliferative lesions were found in a few control CD-1 mice in the same study. In addition, it was also argued that the lesions were neither neoplastic nor preneoplastic in nature. Similar lesions were not seen in rats treated with misoprostol for two years. 593 Lesions characterized by such intense proliferative activity may be difficult to distinguish from neoplastic lesions. Indeed chronic administration of hydrogen peroxide, widely used as an antiseptic and in dental products, to C57BL/6J mice in drinking water was reported by Ito and colleagues not only to potentiate the development of a similar type of duodenal hyperplasia but also to produce a small number of adenocarcinomas after a period of two years. 591, 594 These were non-metastatic atypical (dyplastic) flat lesions associated with erosions and inflammation. It has been argued that as hydrogen peroxide is unlikely to reach the duodenum intact, these results were related to an interaction with greatly decreased water consumption and the resultant abrasion of the luminal lining by dry pelleted rodent feed. 595 However, this may simply be another example of neoplastic development following prolonged periods of chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal mucosa at doses irrelevant for the usual use of hydrogen peroxide in humans (see neoplasia, below). Some compounds may produce proliferative reactions that mimic intestinal dysplasia. This has been well described in human biopsies in patients being treated with compounds such as colchicine and taxol that interfere with tubulin and inhibit its polymerization into microtubules. 362\u00c0364 This effect produces mitotic arrest characterized by prominent ring mitoses associated with epithelial pseudostratification, loss of polarity and increased apoptosis, features that may mimic dysplasia. Similar features may occur in laboratory animals (Figure 8.3b) . 363, 409, 410 ",

Like the small bowel, the wall of the colon comprises mucosa, submucosa, muscularis mucosa and serosa. Mucosal plicae are only found in the rectum although plicae semilumaris, formed by folds of the entire thickness of the bowel wall, are found in the colon. The large intestine of the dog resembles that of humans more than that of most other domestic species. It is a simplified tubular structure only slightly larger in diameter than the small intestine. The colon of the dog is divided anatomically into ascending, transverse and descending parts, but there is no well-defined sigmoid segment. The cecum in dog is a small diverticulum, similar to that found in other carnivorous species and it communicates directly with the colon. The cecum and colon are larger in minipigs than in humans and arranged in a series of coils with a vascular arcade in the subserosa rather than mesentery. 447 The colon of the rat and mouse is shaped like an inverted V that can be divided into ascending and descending segments. There is no clearly defined transverse colon. A characteristic feature in both rat and mouse is the presence of a curved kidney-shaped cecum. Its size is intermediate between the large and anatomically complex cecum of herbivores such as the rabbit and the small cecum of carnivorous species. This probably reflects the omnivorous nature and flexibility of the rat and mouse in their dietary habits, particularly their ability to break down cellulose. 596 The cecum of the rat and mouse is a blind pouch from which the colon and ileum exit in close proximity and in which antiperistaltic movements occur. This structure and the presence of bacteria undoubtedly contribute to its ability to function as a fermentation organ in which breakdown of substances can occur in a controlled milieu. 597 Anatomical study has shown that the mouse cecum is less voluminous than the rat cecum. The ampulla, the region between the colon and cecum, is also narrower in the mouse than in the rat. 597 The cecum is the site of absorption of many substances including calcium, magnesium, water and electrolytes vitamin K and fatty acids in these species. Cecectomy has been shown to decrease digestion of carbohydrates and protein and increase loss of fecal water in these species. 598 These anatomical and functional features of the rodent cecum with its peristaltic and antiperistaltic movements may expose this segment of the large bowel to potentially irritant orally administered xenobiotics for more prolonged periods.",

NIH Swiss mice show the most severe histological changes, C57BL/6J mice appear the least affected and rats and hamsters seem to be resistant. 623 Microscopic changes are found primarily in the descending colon, although proximal segments of the colon and the cecum may also be affected. An important morphological feature is epithelial hyperplasia, which occurs maximally two to three weeks after experimental inoculation with Citrobacter freundii. The colonic glands are elongated and lined by cells that show mucin depletion or loss of goblet cells, considerable immaturity and mitotic activity. The surface epithelium may be covered with numerous coccobacilli, which can be visualized in routine hematoxylin, and eosinstained sections. Crypt abscesses, inflammatory cells in the lamina propria, mucosal erosions and ulceration are also features. In regressing lesions there is a rebound increase in goblet cells, which are often distended with mucin. The colonic glands may be branched or irregular. 622 Most laboratory animals are naturally resistant to shigella infections but this is not the case for non-human primates. 11 In infections with shigella, the colon shows a superficial acute inflammatory reaction comprising edema, congestion, hemorrhage and infiltration by acute inflammatory cells. The surface epithelium shows mucin loss and formation of small ulcers where total destruction of the epithelium has occurred. Ulcers can extend into the lamina propria but in general terms the inflammatory process remains relatively superficial. 625 Organisms are also located predominantly in the superficial epithelium.",

Dogs administered 2.5 mg/kg of the non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug indomethecin orally each day for periods of up to 23 days developed not only gastric and small intestinal ulceration but also scattered hemorrhagic erosions in the colon and rectum. Microscopically, these lesions were characterized by loss of superficial epithelial cells, mucus depletion of glandular epithelium and crypt abscesses, frequently with acute inflammation in adjacent lymphoid aggregates in the submucosa. 536 Another example of chemically induced colitis of relevance to the pathology of drug safety assessment is that induced by degraded carrageenans or synthetic sulfated dextrans. Carrageenans are a heterogeneous group of sulfated polysaccharides composed mainly of long chains of D-galactose subunits (D-galactan) derived from red seaweed species which are widely used as food emulsifiers, stabilizers, thickeners and gelling agents. 642 When carrageenans are degraded by acid hydrolysis into smaller molecular weight fragments of about 20 to 40 kDa and administered orally in high doses (e.g. 10% of diet) to rats, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits and rhesus monkeys, colitis results. 643\u00c0647 Similarly, colitis has been induced in rats following administration of a 5% dietary admixture of dextran sulfate sodium, a sulfated polymer of glucose (\u03b1-D-glucose) of molecular weight of 54 kDa and a very high molecular weight D-glucan, amylopectin sulfate. 642, 648 Although histological features of this form of induced colitis vary between study, species and strain, the colitis in rodents is generally characterized mucosal ulceration mainly in the cecum but also in the distal ileum, distal colon and rectum. There is mucus depletion with variable acute inflammatory infiltrate of the intact epithelium, increased cell proliferation, crypt abscesses and inflammatory infiltrate of the lamina propria with edema, hyperemia and even vascular thrombosis in the submucosa. 644, 648 In the cecum of rats, ulcers are linear but often circulating the entire circumference of the intestinal wall with subsequent scarring and stricture formation. Ulcerating lesions in the rectum and at the anal margin are associated with squamous metaplasia. Both the squamous metaplasia and the regenerative hyperplasia of the columnar epithelium have been shown to progress even after cessation of treatment. Foamy macrophages containing metachromatic material, presumably polysaccharide, are also seen in the lamina propria, submucosa, regional lymph nodes, liver and spleen. 648, 649 The precise mechanisms involved in the development of this colitis are unclear. Low dose levels, which may be expected to mimic human exposure, do not produce colitis. Dextrans, carrageenans and other polysaccharides of molecular weights outside the range 20 to 60 kDa tend not to incite colitis. An exception to this is the agent amylopectin sulfate, which has a far higher molecular weight. However, amylopectin is composed of polysaccharide chains which can be degraded by amylase, and therefore smaller molecular weight fragments may be formed in vivo. 642 It has been suggested that colonic disease produced by these agents may be linked to induced changes in intestinal microflora or a result of increased intestinal permeability to antigenic or inflammatory substances normally resident in the large intestine. 645, 650 Long-term administration of high doses of these agents to rats leads to the development of colorectal cancer despite their being devoid of mutagenic activity (see below). The only obvious pathological colonic changes associated with administration of these nongenotoxic agents are chronic inflammation and increased proliferative activity.",

Physical stimulation by distension or increased dietary bulk has long been known to be sufficient to initiate hyperplasia including thickening of the muscle coats. 662, 663 One of the most clearly documented forms of compensatory hyperplasia is that which occurs as a response to surgical resection or bypass of a segment of the colon. Following resection of a segment of colon in rats it has been shown that the remaining proximal segment of the right side of the colon develops an increase in the thickness of the mucosa and the muscularis externa as well as enlargement of lymphoid aggregates. 664 Microscopically, the mucosa of the right side of the colon appears uniformly thickened with accentuated folds, elongated mucosal glands and increased height of the surface columnar cells. The changes are marked up to 30 days following surgery but less pronounced after 72 days. It has been shown that a significant increase in the mitotic index in the proximal segment occurs at seven days but by 14 days the mitotic index returns to normal. The distal, downstream segment shows little or no morphological change but rather a long-lived increase in mitotic activity. It was suggested that these differences were related to the different embryological origin of the segments. 664 A similar form of uniform colonic hyperplasia affecting principally the cecal and rightsided colonic mucosa also occurs in rats following oral administration of sulfated dextrans of molecular weight of approximately 400 kDa (Figure 8.8 ). Oral administration of large volumes of a wide range of poorly absorbable carbohydrates and osmotically active agents can produce similar changes. Dosing rodents with large amounts of compounds such as raw and chemically modified starches, various dietary fibers, caramels, sugar alcohols (lactitol, sorbitol, mannitol, xylilol), lactose, synthetic polydextrose, cyclodextrins, polyethylene glycol and magnesium sulfate has also been linked to an increase in cecal size and colonic mucosal hyperplasia. 665\u00c0668 The characteristic histological appearance of the colonic mucosa following administration of these agents is lengthening of the mucosal glands which are lined by epithelium composed of increased numbers of enlarged epithelial cells including goblet cells (i.e. hypertrophy and hyperplasia) showing increased proliferative activity and more rapid incorporation of tritiated thymidine.",

            "text": "It should be noted that morphometric studies in rats given pectin and cellulose have shown that the precise nature of the administered substances can influence the degree and distribution of the mucosal hyperplasia and any associated smooth muscle hypertrophy. 668 Moreover, some agents may produce additional changes. Mucosal and submucosal edema has been reported in association with the administration of lactose and increased mucosal lymphoid aggregates following lactose or xylitol feeding. There may also be an interaction between dietary fiber content and colonic microflora that influences mucosal growth, although the mechanism is unclear. 669 It is generally argued that the increase in cecal size and mucosal hypertrophy appears related to the osmotic activity of the cecal contents in rodents treated with large doses of these agents and is therefore not relevant to humans exposed to low doses. Thus the changes represent a physiological adaptation to increased osmotic forces when high doses are given irrespective of the contributing compounds. 665 Administration of high doses of laxatives has also been reported to produce mild colonic hyperplasia in laboratory rats. It was considered to be an exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect. 660, 670 Treatment of rodents with antibiotics also causes cecal enlargement or dilatation without significant histopathological changes, probably as a result of changes in cecal microflora. It has been suggested that the enlargement relates to accumulation of urea as a result of inhibition of bacterial ureases. 671 However, histochemical studies of the intestinal mucosa of rats treated with neomycin have also shown treatment-related reductions in activities of NAD tetrazolium reductase, succinate dehydrogenase, esterase, alkaline and acid phosphatase in the distal ileum, suggesting that some antibiotics also possess the potential to directly influence absorption and metabolic functions of mucosal cells. 672 Long-term administration of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E 2 and other prostaglandin E analogs to rats also produces thickening of the proximal colonic mucosa, although this is less marked than in the stomach and duodenum. 196, 199 As in the small intestine, administration of epidermal growth factor to rats and cynomolgus monkeys induces hyperplasia of the colonic mucosa characterized histologically by hyperplasia and increased mitotic activity of crypt cells and reduction in goblet cell numbers with an increase in crypt depth and a slight increase in the numbers of infiltrating neutrophils. 26, 27 ATYPICAL HYPERPLASIA In common with other epithelial surfaces, atypical hyperplasia is associated with the development of colonic cancer in both humans and laboratory animals. The early alterations observed in rats treated with colonic carcinogens are similar to those found in the immediate vicinity of human colorectal carcinomas. The changes are characterized by lengthening, dilatation and branching of glands. The epithelium lining these glands shows mucous cell hyperplasia (goblet cell hyperplasia). Goblet cells contain predominantly sialomucin instead of the normal sulfomucin. 257, 500, 673 As lesions become more atypical, these dilated, branched glands become more complex and lined by epithelium that shows increasing pseudostratification and vesicular cell nuclei. 674 In rats treated with the carcinogens azoxymethane or 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, crypts show diminution of mucus secretion, increased cytoplasmic basophilia, prominent, rounded or enlarged nuclei which show variable degrees of pseudostratification and which eventually develop into frankly invasive glands. 673 Similar alterations occur in rats treated with azoxymethane. Most studies with animal models for human colorectal cancers and preneoplastic changes have used rats or mice given these chemicals. 675 Pertinent to the assessment of drug safety is the fact that atypical hyperplasia and eventually neoplasia can be induced by non-genotoxic agents such as dextran sodium sulfate that produce prolonged chronic colonic inflammation. 669 Potential therapeutic agents designed to poorly absorb may produce similar alterations in the rodent colon when administered in very high doses.",

It is likely that this provides a microenvironment which aids proliferation and survival of malignant cells, promotes angiogenesis and metastasis, subverts immune responses and alters responses to hormones and other mediators. 692 Other suggested factors include reduced apoptosis, alterations to crypt cell metabolism and changes in bile acid enterohepatic circulation. It has also been suggested that bacteria flora specific to rodents might also be involved in tumor development. 694 Although these agents are biologically active compounds, they are non-mutagenic in the usual short-term tests. It has been suggested that carrageenans act as tumor promoters for they have been shown to potentiate the appearance of carcinomas in rats treated with standard intestinal carcinogens. 343 It has also been proposed that these agents are tumor initiators based on the development of carcinomas in rats treated with degraded carrageenans for only two months. 649 However, despite only a short period of treatment, inflammation, regenerative changes and squamous metaplasia persisted throughout a period of 18 months after treatment was withdrawn before development of cancer in these rats.",

Invasive carcinoma may develop in the context of small flat dysplastic changes in the epithelium. In this context grading of the degree of atypical cytological features is useful as severe atypia (dysplasia) may not only be a marker or precursor of carcinoma but may itself be malignant and associated with direct invasion into the underlying tissue. 676 The generally agreed classification for rodent intestinal tumors is summarized as follows. 67, 68 ADENOMA (ADENOMATOUS POLYP) These represent localized, sessile or polypoid neoplasms composed of proliferating tubular glands, which show varying degrees of nuclear hyperchromatism, pseudostratification and cellular pleomorphism (Figure 8.9) . A useful scheme for grading the carcinogenic potential of hyperplastic mucosa and adenomatous polyps in humans based on the degree of epithelial pseudostratification has been proposed by Kozuka. 674 Although experimental neoplasms may not always show the full spectrum of these changes reported in humans, this grading provides a useful baseline concept for the assessment of these noninvasive proliferative lesions. As these polyps progress they show increased nuclear pseudostratification and a typical branching of their glands. If neoplastic cells or glands are seen in the stroma of the stalk or base the diagnosis of carcinoma is made. Villous adenoma is a form of adenoma in which the epithelial proliferation takes the form of elongated villi with a sparse fibrovascular stroma. They can be graded in a similar way to other adenomas.",
