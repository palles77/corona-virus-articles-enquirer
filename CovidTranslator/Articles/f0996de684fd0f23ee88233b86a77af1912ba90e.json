Recent analyses helped shape the notion that RNA genomes are limited to relatively short lengths, at least partly due to their extreme error rates [1] : the longer the genome, the more likely detrimental mutations will accumulate to inactivate the virus. Indeed, most RNA virus genomes average 7-12 kb in length. A length that, given the error rates of RNA dependent RNA polymerases, is expected to receive 1-2 mutations per nucleotide site per replication. RNA viruses rely on high mutation rates for efficient adaptation to the dynamic environment of infected individuals. Indeed, higher replication fidelity variants demonstrate reduced fitness in animal models [2] [3] [4] . More recently, low fidelity RNA viruses, with a higher mutation load of per replication cycle, have been isolated. These viruses present compromised fitness in vivo [5] , suggesting that an optimal mutation rate has been selected through evolution to generate sufficient diversity for adaptation but limiting the accumulation of too many 'bad' mutations. These recent works suggest that virus mutation rates are not necessarily fixed or constant and might be modulated depending on the growth conditions, by altering viral polymerase fidelity.",

Rather than being a question of polymerase fidelity, the answer may lie in the RNA modifying activities of other virally encoded enzymes. Smith and Denison [http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1016/j.coviro.2012.07.005] cover recent evidence that the non structural protein nsp14, which carries an exoribonuclease domain, acts as an RNA editing, proofreading enzyme that may 'lighten' the burden of erroneous replication on such a large genome [6, 7] . Thus, it is tempting to speculate that in acquiring an accessory proofreading mechanism, a dramatic jump in genome length could be tolerated, and with it, the acquisition of a larger repertoire of virally encoded functions.",

            "text": "But is proofreading and fidelity the only response possible to the burden and risk of extreme mutation frequencies? Theoretically, the specific nucleotide and codon sequences of a genome determine the mutational robustness of that sequence. For example, for amino acids encoded by multiple codons, changing nucleotides at the same position within a codon can result in different amino acid substitutions with different impacts on protein structure and function. Alternatively, regions of complex RNA folding and structure may be differently affected depending on which nucleotide is substituted into a given site. In his review, Santiago Elena [http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1016/j.coviro.2012.06.008] provides a thorough discussion of this aspect of virus evolution that may benefit from recent technological advances, such as the ability to describe mutation distribution within the virus population by sequencing technologies, more controlled means of manipulating mutation rates and measuring error frequencies. Elena describes how in addition to fine-tuning replication fidelity and proofreading, RNA viruses could potentially evolve more or less robust genomes in response to the mutational burden and demands they encounter while replicating in their hosts [8] . As Elena describes, virus populations could evolve as clusters of genomes that localize within a broad neutral network (that is, where many mutations would be neutral with little or no impact on phenotype and fitness). In this context then, the evolvability of the population depends on what regions of sequence space is covered by the neutral network and whether overlap exists between the current network and a new network that would emerge as the fitness landscape changes with environment.",

As she illustrates, although current, simplified models exclude key features in virus evolution, they are helpful in elaborating new experiments that can validate or refine them. The important goal for future research is to reach a satisfactory and realistic model to describe fitness landscapes, which are surely not as random or as smooth as we tend to draw them out in 2-D illustrations.",

In essence, fitness means 'better than' and it is up to the author, although more often the reader, to figure out exactly to which property one is referring. As Wargo and Kurath [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2012.07.007] highlight, virus fitness frequently refers to replicative fitness, the ability of one virus to outcompete another in co-infections in tissue culture or in vivo [10] . In this context the winners are sprinters, the fastest at replicating the genome and packaging the genetic material into virion. However, the authors make the important point that, as many evolutionary studies are moving into more complex infection models and natural hosts, overall fitness becomes the ability to outperform in numerous tasks: entry, replication, dissemination, transmission, colonization. . .somewhat analogous to the decathlon event of the Olympics, it is no longer just a sprinter's race. Indeed, the fastest 'replicator' might kill its host too quickly and fail at transmission; the best 'disseminator' might alert the immune system too soon, and so on. In addition to covering a very large body of recent work addressing fitness, the authors raise the current challenges on how to define it, how to properly measure it and how to consolidate evidence from tissue culture and in vivo experiments in different hosts.",

            "text": "It is important to keep in mind, when speaking of fitness that the values assigned to any genotype are extrinsically dependent on the environment in which the genotype currently exists. Thus, fitness landscapes can only be assigned to very narrow experimental conditions that often do not reflect the dynamic nature of the infected individual. A genotype that could be considered of high fitness in one tissue (fitness peak) may represent a lower fitness genotype in another tissue (plateau or valley in the new fitness landscape). Indeed, a substantial difficulty in measuring and monitoring fitness in the context of a more complex infection model, particularly in whole host organisms, is disentangling the population dynamics that occur when a virus is colonizing new tissues or transmitting between hosts. In these situations, the relative fitness of individual viruses or the overall virus population will be influenced by the relative population size as it fluctuates through any number of population bottlenecks: selection acts intensely on large populations, while small populations are more significantly impacted by stochastic events in genetic drift. As Guti\u00e9rrez, Michalakis and Blanc [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2012.08.001] report, this requires determining the effective size of the replicating population at different times and in different places within the host system [11] . Covering recent, important contributions in the literature of plant, veterinary and medical virology, the authors reveal that quantitative information is still sparse on how a fluctuating multiplicity of infection impacts the overall fitness of a virus population, the selection of the fittest variants and ultimately, viral evolution.",

This leads to the question of evolution of virulence and the trade-off hypothesis where a balance is struck between competing to more rapidly colonize and dominate a host environment, and minimizing the potential harm imposed to the host which could reduce the virus' success in transmission. For a virus evolving in permissive cell culture models where resources and infection conditions are kept constant, evolution may favor selection of the fastest (sometimes the most 'virulent') replicator. But in more natural settings, the results of such experimental studies lose relevance. For tripartite relationships in which a virus infects a microbial host, which in turns colonizes a macrobial host, the evolutionary effects of fitness trade-off could be particularly strong. Marquez and Roossinck [http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1016/j.coviro.2012.06.010] present recent works on viruses infecting unicellular eukaryotes (e.g. Leishmania, Trypanosoma, Trichomonas that infect higher eukaryotes), in which the presence of virus increases survival or spread of the microbial parasite [12] . Equally interesting is their own work on thermal tolerance in which the presence of a virus in a fungus infecting tropical panic grass (results that were reproduced in tomato plants) permitted the plant (and thus, both the fungus and virus) to thrive at higher temperatures that would otherwise be lethal [13] .",

The reasons are obvious, to characterize virus population dynamics in vivo one should take in to consideration the ongoing virus-host arms race, the evolutionary tug-of-war. Sawyer and Elde [http:// dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2012.07.003] remind us of how these virus evolution studies reveal important information on host evolution as well and interestingly, they also uncover positive spins to virus-host 'unnatural' mismatches [14] . The authors bring forth several points that we should all bear in mind when designing experiments. For example, using clonal hosts and clonal viruses in the laboratory may not always reveal the spectrum of possible host-virus interactions that may exist in nature, particularly for viruses infecting different species or crossing over into a new species. Furthermore, virologists often hunt for cell lines or hosts that are highly permissive for the replication of a certain virus in order to recover high viral titers. It is important to consider that, by ignoring other less permissive hosts, we may be casting aside opportunities to discover new restriction factors that in the situation where the natural host is used, the virus may have already evolved evasion mechanisms. Thus, coupling these studies with other non-host species may not necessarily be a bad thing, and could help identify the specific mechanism involved.",

The resources available to us to study virus evolution are unparalleled in history: worldwide sentinel and surveillance networks for field samples, a plethora of natural and transgenic animal models, increasing molecular precision (such as infectious clones and single genome amplification), ultra deep sequencing technology, and bioinformatic tools. However, the challenge in merging the theoretical, computational, experimental and realworld research paths being forged is daunting and will require a solid, collaborative commitment by all of us to reach beyond our individual comfort zones.
