Ia Ag on both glia types was induced by IFN-~,. Reagents known to increase intracellular cAMP or activate intracellular protein kinase C (PKC) reduced IFN-3,-induced Ia Ag expression by astroglia. In contrast, increasing intracellular cAMP had no suppressive effect on Ia Ag expression by microglia. These results indicate (1) cAMP and PKC negatively regulate IFN-3,-induced Ia expression on astroglia, and (2) Ia expression is regulated differentially in astroglia vs. microglia. These findings may explain the frequent observation of Ia \u00f7 microglia (or macrophages) but not astroglia in various neurodegenerative diseases.",

            "text": "Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens (Ag) (also know as Immune response associated Ia Ag) are cell surface molecules that play major roles in regulating immune responses (Kaufman et al., 1984) . Although the brain has traditionally been considered an immunologically privileged site, immune responses have been shown to occur in the central nervous system (CNS). An effective immune response to an infectious agent or an altered immune response to auto-antigens in the CNS presumably requires the expression of Ia Ag on brain cells (Watanabe et al., 1983; Sobel et al., 1984; Olsson et al., 1987) . In accord with this, in vitro studies indicate that Ia Ag can be induced on distinct populations of brain cells such as microglia, astroglia, and endothelial cells (Wong et al., 1985; Frei et al., 1987; Male et al., 1987; Suzumura et al., 1987) . Interferon-~, (IFN-y) is the most potent inducer of Ia Ag on these cells (McCarron et al., 1986; , although other substances including viruses are known to affect Ia Ag expression on rat astroglia . In vivo, la Ag + microglia have been observed in a large number of neurodegenerative diseases (Hayashi et al., 1988; McGeer et al., 1988) ; in contrast, the description of Ia Ag + astroglia in vivo has been rarer. In situ, immunohistochemical studies have shown that astroglia in active chronic lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS) are positive for Ia Ag (Traugott et al., 1985; Traugott and Lebon, 1988) . However, other MS samples did not have this characteristic  for review, see Hayashi et al., 1988) . These observations suggest that astroglia may regulate Ia Ag differently from microglia.",

A collection of previous studies suggest that the intracellular signals utilized by IFN--/ in the induction of Ia Ag might vary from cell type to cell type Koide et al., 1988) . Hence, in some cell types protein kinase C (PKC) activation appears to play a role in the induction of Ia Ag expression, while in other cells PKC is not involved. So far, the intracellular signalling molecules involved in IFN-T-induced Ia Ag expression on brain cells are unknown. This is pertinent considering (1) the importance of Ia Ag in normal and aberrant immune responses in the CNS, and (2) the wealth of CNS mediators that can alter secondary messenger levels and potentially alter the status of Ia Ag expression or nonexpression by glial cells.",

In neurodegenerative disease states, reports of Ia Ag + microglia or macrophages are significantly more frequent and consistent than Ia Ag + astroglia. This paucity of Ia Ag on astroglia in situ led to the hypothesis that astroglial Ia expression may be down-regulated by endogeneous CNS mediators (Frohman et al., 1988a, b) . Many studies have demonstrated that glia are exposed to and respond to neurotransmitter-like substances released from neurons (Koda and Bloom, 1977; Ariano et al., 1982) . Recently, norepinephrine (NE) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) have been shown to inhibit IFN-T-induced Ia Ag expression on cultured rat astroglia (Frohman et al., 1988a, b) . It has been proposed that the cAMP-dependent pathway is involved in the down-regulation of Ia Ag expression generated by both NE and VIP (Frohman et al., 1988a, b) . The role of secondary messengers on Ia Ag expression by microglia has not been investigated, most probably due to difficulties in obtaining sufficient numbers of these cells for experimentation.",

Astroglia treated with all other substances at various concentrations for various incubation times (3 h to 5 days) showed no Ia Ag induction. Combined treatment with PMA (10 ng/ml) plus A23187 (0.2/tM) for 2 days did not induce Ia Ag.

Several controls were used to determine if the suppressive effects of PMA could be attributed to PKC activation. First, preincubation of cells with PMA is known to initiate the degradation of PKC and its sustained disappearance from cells (Young et al., 1987; Ase et al., 1988) . Prolonged pretreatment (1 day) with a high dose of PMA (1 #M) is the standard protocol used to deplete PKC in various cells. Such pretreatment did not suppress the IFN-3,-induced expression of Ia, and actually slightly increased Ia Ag expression on astroglia (Table 2) . Conversely, IFN-y-induced Ia Ag expression on astroglia was suppressed by pretreatment with PMA for a short time (10 min to 1 h). Secondly, the effect of H7, a potent and selective inhibitor of PKC was also tested (Hidaka et al., 1984) . Pre- treatment with H7 (20 ~M) for 1 h prior to the addition of IFN-y did not inhibit Ia Ag expression on astroglia (Table 3~ . Neither was an inhibition of IFN-v-induced Ia Ag expression observed after longer pretreatment with H7 (10/~M, 3 h). On the contrary, H7 reversed the suppressive effect of PMA on Ia Ag induction. Collectively these resuits suggest that PKC activation is not necessary for IFN-~/-induced Ia Ag expression on astroglia ",

The findings with astroglia imply that two major signal-transducing molecules, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and PKC, act as negative regulatory signals of the IFN-T-induced Ia Ag expression on these cells. In fact, simultaneous activation of both PKA and PKC abrogated Ia Ag expression (90% suppression of Ia Ag expression).",

            "text": "Negative effects of PKC on IFN-T-induced Ia Ag expression by astroglia have not been previously reported. A priori, PKC would appear to be a likely signalling molecule for astroglia based on the following findings: (1) the receptor-linked inositol lipid pathway can be activated in astroglia (Girard et al., 1985; Mochley-Rosen et al., 1987) , and (2) astroglia are rich in immunoreactive PKC (Pearce et al., 1986; Ritchie et al., 1987) . In fact, one report showed that PMA per se could induce Ia Ag expression on rat astroglia (Frohman et al., 1988a) . We extensively investigated the role of PKC in Ia Ag induction using a combination of PMA, an inactive phorbol ester 4a-phorbol, and an inhibitor of PKC, H7. Our results demonstrate that (1) PKC activation does not appear to be involved in the positive regulation of astroglial Ia Ag by IFN-y because H7 does not affect this process, (2) PMA does not induce Ia Ag even in the presence of A23187, and (3) most interestingly, PKC activation can actually inhibit IFN-7induced Ia Ag expression by astroglia. This is in contrast to the observation of Massa et al. (1987b) that both PMA and Ca ionophore A23187 induced Ia Ag expression on rat astroglia. However, in their study Ia Ag induction by these inducers seems to occur at a narrow concentration and specific treatment interval (for example, only at 10 ng/ml of PMA for 5 days). We duplicated their treatment protocol and still did not observe any Ia Ag induction. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear.",

Compatible with these hypotheses, a number of studies indicate that cultured astroglia express receptors that regulate phosphatidylinositol metabolism, which activate PKC (Pearce et al., 1985; De George et al., 1986) . Astroglia also express the /3-adrenergic and a-adrenergic receptors for norepinephrine, which increase cAMP and diacylglycerol levels. Many endogenous brain substances are able to modulate cAMP or PI metabolism via surface receptors and these may suppress the expression of Ia Ag on astroglia. Further studies, including transcriptional and translational analyses, must be carried out to understand the mechanism of negative control of Ia Ag expression on astroglia. A preliminary Northern hybridization analysis indicates that IFN-7 induction and DBcAMP inhibition are both regulated at the transcriptional level (unpublished data).",

The regulation of Ia Ag on microglia also may be different from macrophages since a previous report indicates that cAMP inhibits the induction of macrophage Ia Ag expression (Steeg et al., 1982) .

In vitro both microglia and astroglia can be induced to express Ia Ag by IFN-7 and can function as APC .

This is true for rat experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (Hickey et al., 1985; Matsumoto et al., 1986 ) and a large number of human neurological diseases (McGeer et al., 1988) .

Conversely, the observation of Ia Ag \u00f7 astroglia in brain tissue sections is rare. This study presents a potential basis for the differential expression of Ia Ag by microglia and astroglia.
