Colonizers of the oral cavity, such as Streptococcus gordonii, and non-lactic-acid-producing food microorganisms, such as Staphylococcus carnosus and Staphylococcus xylosus or Bacillus subtilis, are not discussed in detail; other reviews have described the use of these bacteria as mucosal delivery systems 4-6 . We do not address the active research that has been pursued in the development of probiotic-based functional foods. Several articles that describe LAB as mucosal delivery vehicles in vivo have recently been published [7] [8] [9] [10] . The first pilot trial with a recombinant LAB in humans was published in 2006 (Ref. 11) . As the field moves into the arena of human clinical trials, it is timely to assess what has been learned so far, identify the gaps in our understanding and discuss the future potential of LAB as mucosal delivery vehicles.",

Although pathogen traits can facilitate entry of the bacterial vector into the body and heighten the host immune response, a balance must be met between immunogenicity versus the reactogenicity that leads to possible side effects. Decades of research were needed to produce vaccine strains of attenuated Salmonella spp. that maximize immunogenicity and minimize side effects in experimental models and humans 15 .

Some candidate LAB vaccines have elicited antigen-specific IgA responses in faeces, saliva or bronchoalveolar and intestinal lavage fluids, as well as antigen-specific IgA-secreting cells in the lungs and mesenteric lymph nodes (TABLe 1) . In some studies, IgA responses have been reported to fluctuate between mice and do not seem to be sustained for long periods after vaccination.

Dietary LAB refers to those species and strains that are used in food-and feed-fermentation processes. The term LAB does not reflect a phyletic class, but rather a group of organisms that are defined by their ability to produce a common end product -lactic acid -from the fermentation of sugars. LAB have limited biosynthetic abilities, and require pre-formed amino acids, B vitamins, purines, pyrimidines and, usually, a sugar as a carbon and energy source. These nutritional requirements restrict their habitats to those in which the required compounds are abundant. Nevertheless, LAB occupy a range of niches, including milk, plant surfaces and the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract and vagina of vertebrates. Compartmentalization of the response to commensal bacteria is one of the mechanisms by which pathological immune responses to the intestinal microbiota are avoided 18, 22 . This also implies that IgA responses to resident commensals could be a controlling factor in the uptake of bacteria and the ability of luminal bacteria to interact with the systemic immune system. Mucosal tolerance to non-pathogenic commensal LAB could be considered a beneficial property in relation to mucosal delivery",

A recent study on human biopsy material from the colon and ileum concluded that few bacteria are present at the mucus layer, and those that are present reside on the luminal side 26 . Furthermore, no direct contact between bacteria and epithelial cells was observed in healthy intestinal tissue, Providing that they survive transit through the stomach, most bacteria that are introduced into the intestinal tract end up in the lumen or trapped in the mucus layer, which is secreted by goblet cells in the villiated epithelium of the small intestine or the non-villiated epithelium of the large bowel (not shown). Here, recombinant proteins that are secreted by the bacteria or released from lysed cells could come into contact with the mucosal epithelium (step 1). Polymeric immunoglobulin A (IgA) that is secreted by mature plasma cells in the lamina propria is secreted via the polymeric IgA receptor, through epithelial cells, into the gut lumen, and could, potentially, be a controlling factor in bacterial persistence and uptake (step 2). Bacteria that contact the apical surface of the epithelium might be sampled by dendritic cells (DCs) that can pass protrusions between enterocytes without the loss of epithelial integrity (step 3). This is heightened during inflammation owing to the chemotactic recruitment of DCs, and could also occur in the isolated lymphoid follicles that are found in the colonic epithelium. The Peyer's patches that are found in the small intestine are sites where bacteria, other particulate antigens and certain cell adhesins can gain increased access to the specialized follicular-associated epithelium that overlays the mucosal lymphoid follicles. M cells in the follicular-associated epithelium transport luminal antigens across the epithelium, where they can induce primary immune responses (step 4). DCs that are present in the dome of the Peyer's patches can phagocytose bacteria and traffic to the mesenteric lymph nodes, where they can directly prime T-cell responses to antigens that are derived from the bacteria (step 5). If the epithelium is damaged, for example, as a result of acute colitis or chronic intestinal inflammation, luminal bacteria can gain access to the epithelium and might even be found in the mucosal tissues (step 6).",

Several factors that could affect immunogenicity have been systematically investigated using a single model antigen, tetanus toxin fragment C (TTFC). This antigen has been expressed in three different bacterial hosts -L. lactis, Lactobacillus spp. and S. gordonii -that varied with respect to their capacity to survive and persist in the murine gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity or vaginal cavity, respectively [31] [32] [33] . using the same mouse strain as a recipient, strains of L. lactis and Lactobacillus spp. that produce TTFC have been shown to independently elicit protective immune responses to challenge with tetanus toxin, but these studies cannot be directly compared because of differences in dosage and other methodologies [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . In a recent study that compared alanine racemase cell-wall mutants of L. lactis and L. plantarum as delivery vehicles for TTFC, it was concluded that L. plantarum was more immunogenic than L. lactis (approximately tenfold based on mean serum total IgG titres) 39 . However, in this study, a nisin-inducible expression system in L. lactis was compared with a strong constitutive expression system in L. plantarum, and it is possible that nisin treatment affected the physiology and survival of L. lactis in the gastrointestinal tract. In a direct comparison of L. plantarum, Lactobacillus casei and L. lactis that used repeated bacterial doses to immunize mice by the intragastric route, we found no overriding advantage in using LAB that could persist to elicit an antibody response to TTFC (J.W., A.M., M.C. Geoffroy and C. Rush, unpublished observations). Although these three bacterial vectors differ in their cell-wall composition, physiology and behaviour in the gastrointestinal tract, this finding suggests that robustness (or persistence) of the LAB vaccine vector is not the only factor that affects induction of a systemic response to the expressed antigen.",

By contrast, using mucosal routes of administration, intracellular expression of TTFC was more immunogenic than cell-surface expression 38 . The e7 antigen of human papillomavirus 16 has been expressed in L. lactis in the cytoplasm in a secreted form and in a form that is tethered to the cell envelope, and antigen immunogenicity has been evaluated by measuring cellular immune responses after intranasal immunization 42 . Mice that were immunized with cell-wall-anchored e7 antigens elicited higher cytokine responses in splenocytes that were stimulated with an e7 peptide post-immunization than those that were immunized with a strain which expressed intracellular e7. Although this might indicate that the cell-wallanchored form of the antigen is more immunogenic, it could also be due to the production of increased total amounts of antigen by the strain that expresses cell-wall anchored e7.

In fact, the cell-wall-anchored strain contained more vP2 antigen, both attached to the cell wall and in the protoplast fraction, and therefore its relative immunogenicity could be due to increased antigen dose or location or both. Surface-localized antigens might be more susceptible to degradation in the highly proteolytic environment of the digestive tract than in the nasopharyngeal cavity, so some caution is needed when extrapolating results that were obtained using different routes of immunization.

In mouse models, it is generally accepted that T H 1-type cytokines promote a class switch to IgG2a and suppress the levels of IgG1, which is associated with a T H 2-type immune response. Thus, it has been concluded that LAB vaccines promote a mixed T H -cell response 32, 36, 37, 43 (TABLe 1) . This was recently confirmed by an analysis of cellular responses to intragastric and intraperitoneally administered L. lactis-expressing TTFC 43 . A TTFC-specific T H -cell response with a mixed T H 1-and T H 2-type cytokine profile was found in the intestine and in the spleen following intragastric immunization. Interestingly, however, an IgG1-biased subclass profile was obtained when the lactococcal vaccine was administered parenterally, which confirmed the importance of the route of vaccination in determining the response phenotype. Depending on the target organism and requirements for immunity, the ability of LAB to shift cellular immune responses towards T H 1 may be advantageous for vaccination strategies, as was recently shown in a respiratory-challenge model of pneumococcal infection 9 .",

A number of applications are being sought for mucosal delivery of IL-12 using recombinant L. lactis. These efforts were spurred on, in part, by the side effects of systemic administration of IL-12, which has pleiotropic effects on T and B cells and is a key regulator of T H 1 differentiation. Interferon-g and IL-12, which are produced by T H 1 cells, play crucial parts in the stimulation of natural-killer-cell activity and maturation of cytotoxic lymphocytes, and thus in protection against infectious diseases and vaccination against cancer. An IL-12-secreting strain of L. lactis was co-administered intranasally with another strain of L. lactis that expressed a cell-wall-anchored e7 antigen from HPv16, which is the main aetiological agent of cervical cancer 47 . Post vaccination, mice were challenged with a lethal dose of the tumour cell line TC-1, which expresses the e7 antigen. In the combined-vaccine group, 50% of the mice were protected from tumour development for at least 100 days, as compared with 35 and 0% in the e7-expressing strain of L. lactis-vaccinated group and control group, respectively.",

Open questions that are related to the immunogenicity of candidate bacterial vectors (BOX 2) include the effect of the route of administration, the location of the expressed antigen (for example, intracellular, secreted or anchored) and the behaviour of the bacterial vector in vivo, including its capacity to direct de novo antigen synthesis. Intranasal immunization seems to be more efficient than the intragastric route at eliciting systemic responses, and even killed organisms have been useful in eliciting a response by this route. It is not clear if transient persistence of the bacterial strain is an advantage for vaccination, and this aspect would be best addressed using isogenic strains that have been engineered to influence their persistence in vivo. It is evident that mucosal vaccination using L. lactis or L. plantarum promotes a mixed T H -cell response compared with injection of the antigen with alum. As our understanding of the immunomodulatory properties of different LAB increases, it might be possible to select vaccine carriers that influence the balance between T H 1-and T H 2-cytokine production.",

Furthermore, intranasal vaccination with a lactococcal vaccine that expressed a conserved C-repeat region from the M protein of S. pyogenes conferred significant cross-serotype protection against pharyngeal infection 16 . Mice vaccinated subcutaneously were not protected against pharyngeal infection, and further analysis of the correlation between antibody response and protection indicated that an antigen-specific IgA response might be sufficient for protection. vaccination and protection against Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, a swine pathogen, has been reported using a mouse challenge model and intragastric or intranasal immunization with L. lactis that expresses the protective antigen SpaA 48 . Oral immunization with L. lactis that expresses the HIv-1 env protein on its cell surface was shown to have a protective effect in mice that were challenged intraperitoneally with a vaccinia virus that expressed HIv-1 env 49 .

The first of these vaccine studies revealed that recombinant L. plantarum nCIMB8826 strains that produce the urease B antigen elicit partial protection against Helicobacter felis in mice 50 . An alanine racemase mutant of strain nCIMB8826 was superior to the wild type in reducing the load of H. felis in the stomach (also shown using TTFC 39 ), but was not as effective as vaccination with the antigen together with cholera toxin as an adjuvant. The reasons for the improved vaccine-delivery properties of the alanine racemase mutant strain are unknown; however, because the intestinal persistence of both the wild-type and mutant strains in mice are similar, it was speculated that this might be due to enhanced release of the antigen in vivo. The second study showed that intranasal administration of L. lactis that expresses pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) afforded better protection against respiratory challenge with virulent pneumococci than intranasal PspA or PspA that was injected with alum 9 . This was attributed to a shift towards a T H 1 response. In a sepsis model, the lactococcal vaccine afforded protection that was similar to that obtained with the injected vaccine. Decreased colonization of S. pneumoniae has also been observed in mice following nasal inoculation of different LAB that express pneumococcal surface antigen A 51 .

Daily mucosal administration of IL-10-secreting L. lactis caused a 50% reduction in colitis that had been induced by dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) and prevented the onset of colitis in IL10 -/-Sv or ev mice that spontaneously develop severe colitis 57 . This beneficial effect was dependent on the secretion of IL-10 by live lactococci in situ. notably, a 10,000-fold lower dose of IL-10 was needed compared with intravenous injection of the cytokine.

Some genera, such as the streptococci, do contain species that are recognized as opportunistic pathogens, although most strains are sensitive to clinically used antibiotics. Although lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are intrinsically resistant to some antibiotics, resistance traits are not typically mobilized by horizontal gene transfer. The release of genetically modified LAB poses new safety and containment issues. Concerns include: the potential of a foreign gene to affect the safety status of LAB and the possibility that the recombinant gene product could have unintentional effects on the host, such as allergenicity or autoimmunity. The possibility that a transgene (or transgenes) or a genetically modified organism could be transferred to other individuals, and that propagation could occur outside of the host, are also important issues that need to be addressed. Long-term persistence is unlikely to be a concern, as most LAB do not persist in humans for more than a few days after administration. A thorough evaluation of all the safety issues is required on a case-by-case basis 93 . The strategy that has been adopted for the containment of genetically modified L. lactis that expresses interleukin-10 in humans might also be suitable for other applications in the future 11 .",

One strain that produced low levels of intracellular BLG (4 \u00b5g per inoculum of 9 x 10 9 lactococci) was compared with 4 other strains that were engineered to secrete BLG (12-67 \u00b5g per inoculum, although the antigen remained mostly cellassociated).

Intranasal treatment of mice with recombinant LAB strains that express Bet v1 before antigen sensitization led to a significant shift towards a non-allergic T H 1-type immune response to Bet v1 compared with non-expressing control strains or a control group that was administered with buffer. The intragastric route seemed to be less effective in modulating the immune response to Bet v1, and only recombinant L. plantarum (not L. lactis) was effective by this route 70 . The L. lactis strain produced approximately fourfold less Bet v1 than the L. plantarum strains, which might explain the lower efficacy of this strain. This concurs with previous observations that the reduction of BLG-specific Ige was most effective with L. lactis strains that produced the highest amounts of allergen 68 . However, differences between these two strains in their intrinsic immunomodulating capacities and/or gut persistence cannot be ruled out as contributing factors. LAB delivery of Bet v1 also induced allergen-specific IgA both in the airways and the gut, but the protective capacity of IgA with respect to allergy is still a matter of general debate. Mouse-model studies of the inhalant dust-mite allergen Der p5 have shown promising results on the use of orally administered recombinant LAB that produce Der p5 to reduce local allergen-induced airway inflammation and hyper-reactivity 71 . Induction of oral tolerance to chicken ovalbumin (OvA) has also been reported by intragastric administration of L. lactis-secreting OvA 72 . In contrast to the studies mentioned above with BLG and Bet v1, L. lactis did not induce counter-regulatory T H 1 immune responses to the allergen. It seems that in OvAspecific T-cell-receptor transgenic mice, oral tolerance is mediated by the induction of CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells that function through a transforming-growthfactor \u03b2-dependent mechanism. It remains to be seen whether this mechanism also occurs in non-transgenic mice from the same background; if this is the case, then L. lactis could be further developed as an effective tool for inducing antigen-specific tolerance.",

In addition, Cv-n was secreted from S. gordonii and bound to gp120 of HIv-1 in a concentration-dependent manner. L. lactis and L. plantarum have also been engineered to express high levels of Cv-n by optimizing expression signals for translation initiation and secretion 76 .

Similarly, L. casei has recently been used to secrete a single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibody that can block cell-associated HIv-1 transmission across an in vitro culture model of the cervical epithelium 79 . The scFv antibody is specific for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), and thus inhibits the binding of monocytes and activated CD4 + T lymphocytes to the epithelium via this receptor. The anti-ICAM1 scFv antibody that was secreted by L. casei was shown to block monocyteassociated HIv-1 transmission across a cervical epithelial monolayer in vitro.",

According to the latest research, the native HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp160 is cleaved to form the subunits gp120 and gp41, with gp120 directing the initial interaction with the CD4 receptor on the host cell. This stabilizes the gp120 structure to promote binding to a chemokine receptor, which then mechanically triggers a conformational change in gp41 such that the gp41 fusion peptide can enter the cellular membrane to initiate fusion of the viral envelope with the cell. Soluble CD4, chemokines or neutralizing antibodies can block the initial binding of gp120 to cell receptors and formation of a fusion intermediate. Moreover, peptides that bind to the exposed amino-terminal domain of gp41 are thought to prevent collapse of the extended gp41 trimer structure that brings the amino-and carboxy-terminal regions of gp41 into close proximity to promote fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Such inhibitor peptides are highly conserved between different HIV-1 isolates, and one (T-20) is currently in clinical use 94 . Conclusions and future perspectives Over the past 5 years, the use of recombinant LAB for mucosal delivery of therapeutic and prophylactic compounds, as well as DnA vaccines, has increased substantially (fIG. 4) . Despite much progress, gaps remain in our understanding of the full potential of recombinant LAB, and many questions remain unanswered",

Robinson et al. 34 reported that L. lactis was poorly antigenic if administered as a vaccine vector via the intranasal and intragastric routes, although significantly elevated antibody titres to LAB were measured in the serum of all immunized mice compared with the naive group. Similarly, Grangette and colleagues 37 observed that cellular immune responses to L. plantarum were even lower than those elicited by L. lactis. Clearly, it is easier to obtain immune responses by intranasal administration than by intragastric administration and even killed LAB are effective by this route. The intranasal route of immunization is particularly attractive because it can elicit lasting antibody responses at both systemic and airway mucosal sites 12, 86 , and is currently of particular interest for the development of airway infections, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in patients with cystic fibrosis 87, 88 . Killed LAB would also have distinct advantages over live organisms with respect to regulatory issues for the clinical use of genetically modified organisms, but the safety of intranasal immunization with LAB needs to be validated. Although immunization by intragastric administration remains an attractive alternative, many factors that are suspected to impact on the immune responses that are elicited by this route remain to be clarified. Based on the protection studies that have been performed in small animals, it is difficult to predict whether the necessary dose for humans will be feasible and as economical as anticipated; vaccination studies in larger animals should help clarify these issues.",
