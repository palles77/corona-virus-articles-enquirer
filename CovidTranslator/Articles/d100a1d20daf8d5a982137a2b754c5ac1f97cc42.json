As the incidence of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is increasing exponentially in the United States and worldwide, healthcare provider demand for these necessities is currently outpacing supply. As such, strategies to safely expand the lifespan of the supply of medical equipment are critically important. In the recent days, weeks, and months, in the midst of the current pandemic, there has been a concerted effort to identify viable ways to conserve Personal Protective Equipment, including sterilization after use. Some hospitals have already begun using UV-C light to sterilize N95 respirators, but many lack the space or equipment to implement existing protocols. In this study, we outline a procedure by which N95 respirators may be sterilized using ultraviolet (UV) radiation in biosafety cabinets (BSCs), a common element of many academic, public health, and hospital laboratories. The primary obstacle to this approach is the possibility the UV radiation levels vary within BSCs. To account for this potential variation in dosing across the base of the BSC, we tested the UV-C radiation in two randomly chosen idle BSCs in our research institute and observed a maximum ratio between the minimum and maximum recorded intensities within a given BSC to be 1.98. Based on these values, we calculated that an N95 mask placed within a BSC with a manufacturer's reported fluence of 100 \u00b5W cm \u22122 should be effectively sanitized for reuse after approximately 15-20 minutes per side. Our results provide support to healthcare organizations looking for alternative methods to extend their reserves of PPE. It is our hope that with an easily implemented strategy, as we have presented here, idle BSCs can be utilized to alleviate the PPE shortage by providing a way to sterilize PPE to allow safe daily re-use. This should be tested on a larger scale, and confirmed in a virology laboratory before adoption, though we contend that in extremis, this method would be preferred compared to re-use without sterilization.",

The UVGI doses were remotely monitored using a UV meter to ensure proper sterilization. 12 Unfortunately, not all hospitals are equipped to set up dedicated rooms for decontamination or possess the specialized UVGI towers that are outlined by Lowe et al. 12 On the other hand, many university-affiliated hospitals and higher academic laboratories have access to biosafety cabinets (BSCs) that are regularly used in research to sterilize laboratory equipment via UV-C light. Due to current social distancing and quarantine measures, there likely exist a substantial number of BSCs that are not currently in use and therefore may be available to be temporarily repurposed for N95 respirator, or other PPE decontamination. A previous study found that UVGI treatment of FFRs in BSCs had no effect on the filter aerosol penetration, filter airflow resistance, or physical appearance of the masks. 5 Additionally, the efficacy of BSC UVGI for achieving complete decontamination of FFRs has previously been validated for influenza virus. 13 ",

From these measurements, we calculated a recommended time of 15-20 minutes per side to irradiate FFRs in a BSC to inactivate potential SARS-CoV-2 virus contaminants. Due to the large number of idle BSCs nationwide, we estimate FFR requirements can be reduced by up to 75%, significantly easing hospital burden due to a significant lack of PPE. Figure 1 .

However, crises such as the current COVID-19 pandemic can create shortages that necessitate measures to conserve PPE. Among potential methods for decontamination, previous work has suggested UVGI results in less physical deformation then bleach, microwave irradiation, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide. 5 Additionally, this and other investigations of UVGI for the purpose of N95 respirator decontamination was motivated by the ubiquity of UV lamp equipped biosafety cabinets, especially at large biomedical research institutions. Various groups have therefore begun sterilizing respiratory protective equipment themselves using UVGI and \"homebrew\" setups. For example, enterprising clinicians at the University of Nebraska Medical Center are stringing N95 respirators between two towers of UVGI bulbs placed on either side of a room in order to inactivate potential SARS-CoV-2 viral contaminants on the masks. 12 From our measurements, normalized to the technical specifications of the manufacturer using a typical BSC, we conservatively estimate the time to sterilize N95 respirators using similar models is 20 min per side. This recommendation represents the time required to deliver a UV dose that is \u224830 times higher than the previously reported dose to inactivate 90% of single-stranded RNA viruses. 2 To scale this protocol to any BSC, we propose that a conservative scaling factor of 1.98 for spatial heterogeneity is likely conserved across BSCs, but the amount of power delivered to the BSC surface likely varies significantly between manufacturers. Note that given the variance between the two BSCs we measured, the true worst-case scaling factor is likely slightly worse than what we measured, as there almost certainly exist BSCs with greater variation in UV radiation intensity. We invite other scientists to add measurements from their own BSCs to our github repository to allow continued updating of this recommendation. 17 Therefore, to calculate a time for an arbitrary BSC model, we recommend using Equation 4:",

Though UV-C light has been shown to transmit into and through FFR materials, the transmittance of light ranges from 23-50% through the outer layer depending on the model of FFR. 6 Therefore, the ability for UVGI to thoroughly sanitize FFRs may vary based on the ability for UV-C light to penetrate through to the internal filtering medium, which contributes the most filtration ability.",

Such a modification may increase the lifespan of each unit of PPE at the cost of potentially incomplete decontamination. More research is needed to determine the number of reuses that could be achieved when decontaminating PPE with a lower UV dose.

By elevating masks off the surface of the BSC and, if necessary, placing reflective material underneath them, it should be possible to ensure that UV radiation reaches the entire mask surface simultaneously and would reduce the manual labor and time required for this protocol. Inspired by the protocol developed by Lowe et al, we propose a workflow to optimize the utilization of institutional resources: 12 1. Prior to use, respirators should be directly labeled to identify the original owner by both name and department. 2. After use, place in sealed packaging and distribute to BSC locations. 3. Using sterile technique, remove masks from packaging and place on working surface of cabinet. 4. Ensure that there is no overlap of adjacent masks, as any unexposed areas will not be sterilized. 5. After transfer, adequately sterilize any external surface that came in contact with the used masks or packaging and destroy the packaging via biological waste. 6. Close the hood and power on the UV light for 20 minutes. 7. After this duration, power off the UV light, open the cabinet, and carefully flip the masks to expose the opposite side, ensuring no overlap of adjacent masks. 8. Close the hood and power on the UV light for 20 minutes. 9. Again, adequately sterilize or dispose of any external surface that comes in contact with the masks. 10. Once the full duration has elapsed, power off the UV light and open the hood.",
