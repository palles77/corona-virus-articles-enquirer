Then it becomes less probable that infectious travelers cross national or regional borders. Border health screening at airports and isolation of infectious travelers work similarly to these voluntary risk-averse behaviors. The community transmission decelerates if such a social distancing works effectively in controlling cross-border exposure. This is an example of a beneficial trend change in epidemic transmission. Detecting whether a trend changes or not helps the public health authorities confirm the efficacy of the current practices of public health intervention and design a more effective public health program.",

The cross-border epidemic transmission ensues from a generally complex interplay between movements and infection. These stochastic processes may have adverse effects. Cross-border movements prompt the geographical distribution of cases to reach equilibrium while infection fuels local outbreak. In this study, the complexity is resolved by decomposing the Langevin equations in Eq. (2) into smaller dimensional model selection sub-problems so that they can be solved individually and sequentially with the state-of-the-art model selectors in Bayesian statistics. The cross-border movements and local outbreak are a special case of the diffusion and reaction of substance. The method is applicable potentially to solving an inverse problem and obtaining findings on the nature of a broad class of population-dynamic systems, whose time evolution as a stochastic reaction-diffusion process is formulated with a system of Langevin equations.",

Raising public awareness includes cancellation or postponement of travels, pre-travel health advisories, giving advices via mass media on hand washing, personal hygiene, cough etiquette, the use of face masks, hand rubs, and vaccine. In addition, border health screening, arrival and departure monitoring, dedicated ambulances, isolated hospital wards, and disinfection on public transport can be implemented. It is anticipated in the current practices that quarantine on board and temperature screening at airports will stop infectious travelers from entering across national or regional borders. Such a naive anticipation gives rise to much controversy about the economic efficiency. The anticipation is tested with observations when the intervention is implemented actually. The efficacy is quantified by the change in the probability parameters, and the economic efficiency is calculated. The public health authorities can accumulate ground information from such testing to organize an internationally shared extensive knowledge base on miscellaneous individual or combined public health intervention, its rational and anticipated outcome, empirical evidence on its efficacy, and possible reasons for the gap between the anticipation and observations, along with the supplementary knowledge from field-based medical case studies, epidemiological, and genetic studies under many demographic circumstances.",

The trend change in the entire population may arise from large localized trend changes in only a few sub-populations (an anomaly which violates the empirical law in Eq. (1)). Adjusting resolutions may be essential in the drilling-down from country level course analysis to province, city, and district level fine analyses. These are the topics for future studies.",
