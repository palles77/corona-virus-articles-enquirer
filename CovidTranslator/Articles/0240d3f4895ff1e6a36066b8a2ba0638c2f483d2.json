Methods: A 2-year prospective study was conducted on 35 adults with CF. P. aeruginosa sputum density was analyzed during stable, exacerbation and post exacerbation assessments. Upon exacerbation, samples were sent for PCR detection of respiratory viruses and the sputum density of P. aeruginosa in patients with a viral infection versus those without was compared. Results: Twenty-two patients experienced 30 exacerbations during the study period; 50% were associated with a viral infection. There was no change in sputum density of P. aeruginosa from the stable to exacerbation state when measured by quantitative culture or by PCR. Virusassociated exacerbations did not result in significant increases in P. aeruginosa sputum density compared to non-viral exacerbations. Conclusion: Sputum density of P. aeruginosa was not increased at the time of CF exacerbation and was not influenced by the presence of viral infection.",

Some studies have found that sputum bacterial density decreases following exacerbations as patients improve clinically with antibiotics [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . These findings lead to the hypothesis that an increase in bacterial density immediately before, or at the time of exacerbation, might contribute to the pathophysiology of exacerbation.

Finally, in a study published by Regelmann et al., parenteral antibiotic therapy resulted in a significant decrease in the sputum density of P. aeruginosa. However, 2 weeks after therapy was discontinued, the sputum density of P. aeruginosa was the same as at the time of acute exacerbation [9] . The combination of these studies, and ours, which measured bacterial density an average of 115 days post-exacerbation and showed no change compared to the time of exacerbation, provides evidence that the decrease in bacterial density in the sputum of CF patients associated with antibiotic therapy for exacerbation is a transient phenomenon.",

Our study did not show the same result. In our study, there was a statistically insignificant 0.58-log difference in the change in sputum density of P. aeruginosa when comparing virus associated exacerbations to those not associated with viruses, and in contrast to the Wark study, non-viral exacerbations exhibited a trend to greater increases in sputum density comparatively. In both studies rhinovirus was the most frequent virus implicated. The reasons for the different results seen in these two studies might be due to differences in bacteria; our study was limited to patients chronically infected with P. aeruginosa, whereas the Wark study was not. Differing results may also be explained by the differences in severity of exacerbations studied or imprecision related to relatively small sample sizes.",

The first is a relatively small sample size which may have impeded our ability to detect a significant change in bacterial density during pulmonary exacerbations, as well as a difference in those exacerbations that were associated with viruses. The second is that the effects of viral infection on bacterial proliferation might be delayed and occur days after exacerbations present clinically. In patients with COPD infected with rhinovirus, peak bacterial density was on day 15 following infection. These rhinovirus-associated COPD exacerbations were mild in severity, and these patients were not treated with corticosteroids or antibiotics [19] . In CF exacerbations the possibility of delayed bacterial proliferation following a virus-associated exacerbation would be difficult to investigate since antibiotics are a standard therapy at presentation and are rarely withheld. Finally, while viruses do not appear to affect the sputum density of P. aeruginosa, this does not preclude other pathogen-pathogen interactions such as effects of viral infections on bacterial phenotype and expression of bacterial virulence factors. For example, in a study where human CF bronchial cells were co-infected with RSV and P aeruginosa, direct binding of RSV to P. aeruginosa was observed, and P aeruginosa was found to exhibit increased adherence to human CF cells in vitro in the presence of RSV [28] . Such interactions were not investigated in our study, and further research on viral-bacterial interactions in CF lung disease is needed.",

Interestingly, in a study by Reid et al., while the majority of patients improved clinically with antibiotics, those patients with a decrease in their sputum density of P. aeruginosa upon completion of treatment were found to have the greatest improvement in their lung function [12] . One hypothesis generated from this finding might be that the changes to bacterial sputum density are greater with more severe exacerbations and might explain why we did not observe a change with the inclusion of mild exacerbations.",

Although 50% of exacerbations were associated with a viral respiratory tract infection, viral infections had no acute effect on changes in P. aeruginosa sputum bacterial density. Given the significance of CF exacerbations, further work is needed to determine if viral infections elicit an immune response that leads to exacerbation that may be independent of P. aeruginosa bacterial load in CF patients [29] . As well, further investigation is required to understand the etiology of exacerbations in patients who do not have viral infections, since increased P. aeruginosa bacterial density in sputum does not appear to be responsible.",
