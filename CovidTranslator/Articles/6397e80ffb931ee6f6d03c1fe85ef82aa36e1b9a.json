Genetic sequence analyses have shown that this new virus is different from any other known human coronaviruses, including the one that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (2) . As of March 7, 2013, a total of 14 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection have been reported to WHO, with eight deaths (4). Illness onsets have occurred from April 2012 through February 2013 (4, 5) . To date, no cases have been reported in the United States.",

The index patient in the cluster, a man aged 60 years with a history of recent travel to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, developed respiratory illness on January 24, 2013, before returning to the UK on January 28 (5, 7, 8) . He was hospitalized on January 31 with severe lower respiratory tract disease and has been receiving intensive care (5, 7, 8) . Respiratory specimens from this patient taken on February 1 tested positive for influenza A (H1N1) virus and for novel coronavirus infection (8) . The second patient was an adult male household member with an underlying medical condition who became ill on February 6, after contact with the index patient, and received intensive treatment but died with severe respiratory disease (5, 9) . This patient's underlying illness might have made him more susceptible to severe respiratory infection. The third patient is an adult female who developed a respiratory illness on February 5, following contact with the index patient after he was hospitalized (5,10). She did not require hospitalization and had recovered by February 19 (5, 6) . Only the index patient had traveled recently outside the UK. Based on their ongoing investigation of this cluster of illnesses, the UK Health Protection Agency has concluded that person-to-person transmission likely occurred in the UK within this family (6) .",
