Medical methods include prostaglandin F 2a (PGF 2a ; Lutalyse, Pharmacia & Upjohn) at 500-1000 /!g/kg for 2 days at mid-gestation; c1oprostenol (Estrumate; Bayer, Shawnee Mission, KS) at 5 f.lg/kg subcutaneously for 2 days; and the prolactin inhibitor/dopamine agonist, cabergoline (Dostinex; Pharmacia & Upjohn), at 5 f.lg/kg orally for 10-12 days at mid-gestation. A combination of daily oral administration of cabergoline (5 f.lg/kg) and c1oprostenol injections (5 f.lg/kgsubcutaneously) every 2 days appears to bea reliable, safe, and practical method for terminating pregnancy at day 30 of pregnancy, when a diagnosis of pregnancy by palpation or ultrasonography can easily be made. All five queens treated in one study aborted in 9 \u00b1 1 day without side effects except a mild hemorrhagic vulvar discharge.",

All cats receiving PGF 2a had decreasing concentrations of progesterone during treatment. Cats that aborted had < I ng/ml, whereas cats that did not abort had> 1 ng/ml of progesterone. Cats should be hospitalized during the administration of prostaglandins.
