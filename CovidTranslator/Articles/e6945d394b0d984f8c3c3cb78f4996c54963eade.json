In many regards, therefore, this infection in mice does not provide an ideal model for the study of virus host relationship in demyelinating diseases characterised by a chronic progressive pattern with relapse and remissions. In a previous report we have shown that changing the species, ages of the animals and dosage of the virus administered, resulted in a subacute form of a primary demyelinating disease in rats after an inoculation period of 2-3 weeks (Nagashima et al., 1978) . In these experiments about 30 ~ of animals developed a subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (SDE) and the remaining animals showed no clinical symptoms at the time of our report. However, after 3 -8 months some of these animals developed neurological signs and revealed neuropathologically fresh demyelinating lesions and numerous completely remyelinated areas in one animal. Areas of relaayelination were also observed in several other animals which failed to display clinical signs.",

Few axons without myelin sheaths were also observed (Fig. 6b) . However, near the small cells a group of well-myelinated myelin sheaths ~vere observed. These well-developed sheaths were demarcated from the surrounding matrix by a basement membrane (Fig. 6c) . It is noteworthy that closely outside of the membrane the astrocytic processes containing glial fibrils were always observed to be contiguous with the basement membrane. These morphologically distinctive features of myelin sheaths were quite similar to those of remyelinating myelin sheaths (Blakemore, 1974) , suggesting that the small-cell foci represent areas of remyelination. The well-developed myelin sheaths surrounded by the basement membrane were considered to represent the PNS-type, whereas the poorly developed myelin sheaths without the basement membrane revealed the CNS-type of remyelination. Electron microscopy confirmed that many cells detectable in the small-cell foci by histological analysis were in fact myelinating cells. Corresponding to these two types of myelin sheaths, two different glial cell formations, the myelinating PNS-type (Schwann cell) and CNS-type (Oligodendrocyte) were observed. Schwann cells were surrounded by a basement membrane, while oligodendrocytes were located outside of these membranes. The nuclear morphology of these cell types were almost identical. The cytoplasm of oligodendrocyte was, however, more electron-dense and slightly larger than that of Schwann cell.",

The histopathological examinations revealed areas of fresh demyelination. In one animal the simultaneous presence of both demyelination and remyelination were observed. The absence of clinical signs when demyelination and subsequent remyelination first occurred suggest that the lesions were either too small to cause neurological symptoms or were localized in areas of the brain which cannot be easily detected clinically in small laboratory animals. The latter interpretation is consistent with the observation that the larger demyelinated areas appear to be restricted for the most part to pontine sensory pathways such as spinal tract of trigeminal nerves.",

In the experiments using gliotoxic compounds the vast majority of axons were remyelinated after 4 weeks and both CNS and PSN-type remyelination was shown to be complete 3 months after degeneration (Blakemore, 1974 (Blakemore, , 1975 . Therefore, it is possible that the animals in our experiments which were examined 6-8 months after virus inoculation might have suffered from primary lesions at least 3 months before the detection of clinical signs of a neurological disease.

In SDE, infectious virus, intracellular viral structures and viral antigens were always detectable in affected areas. In the present study only in one animal virological studies were carried out. It is surprising that after an incubation period of 3 months (case 1) infectious JHM virus could be isolated from brain material and viral antigen be localized in CNS tissue. So far no information is available about the state of virus-cell interaction in this animal, especially about the mechanism which allowed the virus to persist in the brain tissue after inoculation. The morphological similarities between SDE and the animals examined in this study suggest that the mechanism leading to demyelination may be similar between these two groups. However, the long incubation period and the more chronic state of the disease process would suggest a different virus-host relationship in the demyelinating encephalomyelitis with late onset.",

Ghatak et al. (1973) described that peripheral type of myelin sheaths in multiple sclerosis could be traced to adjacent spinal nerves. However, the PNS type of remyelination in case 3 was located at a distance from any existing peripheral nerves or detectable nerves containing blood vessels. It is conceivable that Schwann cells in these areas have arisen from multipotential primitive reticular cells as Ogata and Feigin (1975) have suggested in their studies on remyelination in multiple sclerosis.

Moreover, the inflammatory cells are mononuclear and only detectable in the neighborhood of fresh plaques.

The plaques in JHM infected rats occur consistently in brainstem, spinal cord and optic nerve, but are scarcely detectable in cerebral white matter which is the most commonly affected area in MS. The infrequency of cerebral white matter involvement in rats may be due to the underdevelopment of the cerebral cortex and its fibre tract.
