In addition, it was also most positively relevant to APACHE II and SOFA scores, which reflected a strong correlation between LDH with lung damage as well as disease severity. LDH is a major player in glucose metabolism which is present in tissues throughout the body and catalyzes pyruvate to lactate. It is released from cells upon damage of their cytoplasmic membrane (10) . Previous studies also had noted the importance of LDH as an indicator of lung diseases. In a study on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), researchers found that EBV infected B cells had more LDH transcripts than the uninfected B cells (11) . In addition, the serum levels of LDH increased in PcP patients, probably was due to lung injury (12, 13) . Among patients who were infected during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, 77.8% whose laboratory test showed LDH > 225U/L had lung involvement, without difference between adult and children (14) , which indicated that LDH elevation was associated with various pathogen including virus, and was relevant to lung injury.",

In our study, LDH elevation was positively associated with AST, cTnI and BNP, which verified it as an isozyme of heart and liver. However, it was somewhat surprising that cTnI was neither associated with PSI nor CT semiquantitative score, while was relevant with disease severity. Similarly, BNP that had a strong correlation with APACHE II and SOFA, was not associated with CT semiquantitative score, either. Furthermore, AST which was associated with the APACHE II and SOFA score, was not related to PSI score. This rather intriguing finding might be explained by the fact that the myocardial and liver injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be due to the direct damage of the virus to targeted organs, while not because of hypoxia induced by lung injury. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, structural analysis of the virus has suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in humans(16, 17). The ACE2 receptor is abundantly present in the epithelia of lung and small intestine(18), which might provide possible routes of entry for SARS-CoV-2.",
