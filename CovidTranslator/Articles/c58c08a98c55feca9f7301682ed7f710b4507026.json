Its value to the biodiversity of the world is not only warranted by its unique physical characteristics, such as being the fastest land mammal (chapter 7), but also its unique evolutionary lineage as the only extant representative of its genus, Acinonyx. concerns over levels of genetic variation among cheetahs were first raised as captive programs grappled with difficulties in breeding cheetahs (chapter 27). These observations led to research investigating the biological basis of the low rates of captive breeding success (10%-15%) and the concurrent high rate of infant mortality (29%) . This research led to the discovery of low levels of genetic diversity in the cheetah, which were attributed to one or several severe population bottlenecks. as a consequence, debates arose regarding the impact of low genetic diversity on the survival of the species, and the cheetah has been featured in genetic textbooks since the 1980s. early research on cheetah represented one of the first studies in the new field of conservation genetics.",

While publications on cheetah genetics may appear contradictory at times, the fundamental conclusions have been consistent for over 30 years, with various measures confirming low genetic diversity (section \"Genetic Diversity\"), which was shown to have originated thousands of years ago (section \"historic Demography\"), and with a relatively recent divergence of extant published subspecies (section \"Subspecies Definition and Divergence\"). The differences debated among geneticists only affect the interpretation of genetic results regarding precise timing of events and extent of reduced genetic diversity. This chapter also covers the cheetah's phylogenetic (evolutionary relation based on genetic data) position among other felids (section \"Species-Level Taxonomy\"), the genetic structure of the subspecies and within geographical regions (section \"Phylogeography\"), an overview of additional genetic studies including kinship (section \"additional Insights Into cheetah Genetics\"), and implications of genetic findings for cheetah conservation (section \"Discussion\").",

One of the most striking aspects of molecular genetic studies in the Felidae was how rapidly felids evolved into eight different lineages (over a 6-million-year period), each with unique biogeographical histories. earlier groupings of felid lineages were largely based on morphological features and life-history patterns. The cheetah was generally considered to be an early divergence from the felid radiation due to some of its unique adaptations, including its incompletely retractile claws (chapter 7). however, the advent of genetic approaches has provided clarity to more confidently reconstruct felid evolutionary history, and today the cheetah is included in the Puma lineage, which was the sixth of eight lineages to branch off during felid evolution [7 million years ago (MYa); Johnson et al., 2006; Li et al., 2016; Werdelin et al., 2010; Fig. 6.1] . The cheetah's closest living relatives are known to be the puma (Puma concolor) and the jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi) 1 .

Today the cheetah is found in the Old World, and the puma and jaguarundi in the New World (chapter 3). The cheetah has 19 chromosomal pairs (i.e., 38 chromosomes) like most felid species . The cheetah is the only extant representative of its genus.",

Thus, it was surprising that analyses of 55 southern african cheetahs failed to identify genetic polymorphisms across a total of 52 allozyme loci (O'Brien et al., 1983; O'Brien et al., 1985;  however, insights from these studies were limited, because protein-based markers only assess amino acid changes that alter the electrophoretic mobility of the protein. DNa changes, such as silent/synonymous substitutions are masked in proteins, resulting in an underestimation of the amount of genetic variation in all species. In addition, protein-based markers are more likely to be linked to functional differences and as such allele frequency differences may be susceptible to selective pressure (environmental conditions affecting survival of organisms with a particular characteristic).

These estimates were comparable to the heterozygosity levels of other felids in small isolated populations (e.g., pumas from Idaho, lions from Serengeti and Ngorongoro crater), but lower than in domestic cats (Driscoll et al., 2002; Table 6.1) . Subsequent studies of cheetahs only included a subset of these microsatellite markers, which were not selected randomly, but instead for their known relatively high level of polymorphism, leading to higher heterozygosity estimates. hence, these increased heterozygosity estimates do not reflect the genetic diversity of the cheetah species per se, but are summarized in Table 6 .1 for informational purposes.

The cat is a good model as the general architecture of the Mhc appears relatively conserved within each class of vertebrates; the number of Mhc class I or II genes, however, can vary substantially among species. The domestic cat Mhc region is located on chromosome B2 and includes 19 Mhc I and 8 Mhc II genes (Yuhki et al., 2008) . The cheetah Mhc sequence resolved 278 genes with complete homology to the domestic cat for all Mhc II and most Mhc I genes. Its structural organization was also found to be highly similar to that of the domestic cat (Dobrynin et al., 2015) . an early study of cheetah Mhc I based on RFLP markers showed reduced genetic diversity in cheetah (observed heterozygosity = 0.05-0.07) compared to other species, which was only comparable to that of lions from isolated populations (Gir Forest and Ngorongoro crater; Yuhki and O'Brien, 1990 ; Table 6 .1). Only 2 Mhc I alleles were identified in 2 individual cheetahs through sequencing (Yuhki and O'Brien, 1994;  Table 6 .1) and 5 Mhc II-DRB alleles were identified in 25 individuals through Reference Strand-Mediated conformational analysis (Drake et al., 2004;  (Table 6 .1). While a 5-fold increase in the number of Mhc I alleles identified in 2011 may appear like an increase in genetic diversity, the identification of only 8 additional alleles despite a 54-fold increase in the number of study animals is in fact further confirmation of low levels of allelic diversity in the cheetah. The low level of allelic diversity was further confirmed by comparison to other species, which harbor more alleles in fewer individuals (Table 6 .1). More recently, a 95%-98% reduction in single nucleotide variants (SNVs) was observed when the complete Mhc sequence of 7 cheetahs (4 Namibian, 3 Tanzanian) was compared to that of human (Homo sapiens), dog (Canis familiaris), and an outbred domestic cat; only 11 variants affecting the amino acid sequence were detected in the Mhc I coding region of cheetahs (Dobrynin et al., 2015;  Dobrynin et al. (2015) described patterns of diversity across the entire genome of the cheetah. Five commonly employed metrics confirmed the genic and genomic lack of diversity of the species: SNV incidence was 90% less than that observed in a feral domestic cat; SNV density was 8-15\u00d7 less than in the domestic cat, 1 . The cheeTah european wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris), or human (however it was higher than in lions from the Gir Forest); regions of continuous homozygosity (identical alleles at a given locus/set of loci) were 10-15\u00d7 longer than in the domestic cat; heterozygosity levels were 15%-61% of the levels observed in the domestic cat, tiger (Panthera tigris), and human; SNVs in coding genes were 98% reduced compared to the domestic cat or european wildcat (Dobrynin et al., 2015; Table 6 .1; Fig. 6 .2).",

The demographic event causing this drastic loss of diversity was estimated to have occurred during the end of the Pleistocene (10,000-12,000 years ago; Table 6 .2). This proposal was based on the time estimated for the near-reconstitution of genetic variation at rapidly evolving minisatellite (nuclear DNa marker consisting of variable numbers of tandem repetitions of 5-50 nucleotides) loci. The authors obtained similar estimates with mtD-Na RFLP data calibrated on estimates of divergence of the species from the Panthera genus. This estimated timeframe was later corroborated with 82 microsatellite markers (Driscoll et al., 2002) , with the time needed for nuclear alleles to reach fixation in the Mhc (castro-Prieto et al., 2011) , and with whole genome data (Dobrynin et al., 2015) (Table 6 .2). In the asiatic cheetah population a more recent, independent, bottleneck was inferred based on a significant heterozygosity excess observed in the 18 microsatellite loci tested (charruau et al., 2011) .",

F ST values between Namibia and South africa (0.115) and Namibia and the Kalahari (0.108) were higher than those between South africa and the Kalahari (0.059). however, these values remain below the F ST values recommended for high statistical certainty of population assignment (0.15-0.20; Manel et al., 2002) . also, while the significance of the differentiation between populations (P < 0.001) suggests that accurate population assignment may be possible, attempts to assign 6 cheetahs of unknown origin to a specific region (from a Bayesian exclusion test method and a frequency-based method) were inconclusive. The efficacy of assignment testing in cheetahs will most likely be improved through more comprehensive sampling (more subpopulations and more individuals per region; Manel et al., 2002) . mtDNa data may also help to resolve questions of origin within southern africa, given that 8 haplotypes were identified in a 915 bp sequence of mtDNa in Botswana, Namibia, and South africa (charruau et al., 2011) .",

No regional structure was detected when analyzing samples individually. When individuals were grouped by region, very modest support was given to a tentative grouping of the north-western regions (Outjo, Grootfontein; NJ tree, bootstrap support of 98%) and of the southern regions (Windhoek and Gobabis; bootstrap support of 79%). Multiple component analysis distributed the regions somewhat according to their geographical location, with the most northern region (Outjo) appearing to be most distinct, but F ST values for Okahanja and Outjo (F ST = 0.086) were below the recommended threshold for separate population assignment (0.15-0.20; Manel et al., 2002) . Overall it was concluded that the Namibian cheetah population is panmictic (without barrier to breeding and without population structure), with gene 1.

Weak subdivision among the geographical populations suggests that gene flow occurs, which can be attributed to natural cheetah movements.

Ten of the genes were involved in muscle contraction (both cardiac and striated muscles), specifically the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (which is linked to stress), and in the regulation of catabolic processes, indicating that the cheetah underwent some degree of specialization in these pathways. In the same study over 10 million nucleotides of segmental duplications were identified, and affect genes that are believed to be involved in energy balance, nutrition, and sensory adaptation. In addition, gene expansion was observed in the Mhc extended class I region, which includes vomeronasal receptors, as well as olfactory and G-coupled receptor genes; these gene expansions were tentatively linked to behavior (pheromones) and physiology (e.g., LDh-a and LDh-B are linked to a carnivorous diet). Both segmental duplications and gene expansions lead to temporary redundancy, allowing new gene functions to arise. evidence of historical positive selection on antigen binding sites that interact directly with pathogen-derived proteins was detected for both Mhc classes, particularly Mhc I (castro-Prieto et al., 2011) . Signatures of selection in the Mhc were also identified in the whole genome study (Dobrynin et al., 2015) . a study of the cytochrome P450 gene (cYP2D6), involved in drug metabolism, showed considerable genetic diversity and signs of relaxed selection pressure in felids, including cheetahs (Schenekar et al., 2011) .",

Therefore, the initial discovery of genetic uniformity of the cheetah was quickly followed by concerns about the species' chances of long-term survival. however, the discovery that the event or events leading to the loss of diversity could be placed over 10,000 years ago and that cheetah numbers had recovered by the 19th century, indicate the cheetah's ability to survive and thrive, despite reduced levels of genetic diversity, over extended periods of time. however, this does not guarantee the cheetah's survival in the future, as lack of genetic diversity limits the ability to adapt and evolve, in particular in the light of major changes in environmental conditions or pathogenic pressure.",

The cheetah is only known to suffer from poor sperm quality; none of the other traits observed in the cheetah (e.g., kinked tails, crowded incisors; section \"Investigations of the Molecular Basis for heritable Traits\") are detrimental to individual health, or the capacity to survive and reproduce. This, and evidence of positive signatures of selection on genes involved in muscle contraction and stress metabolism (section \"Signatures of Selection, copy Number Variation, and changes in Gene Families\"), suggests that the low levels of genetic diversity were caused, or followed by, strong selective pressures, which perhaps purged deleterious alleles from the species (e.g., hedrick and Garcia-Dorado, 2016).",

While in principle exchange between populations of different subspecies should be avoided as they may be considered evolutionary significant units (Moritz, 1994) , a compromise between preserving the existing structure and the urgency to rescue a small population at risk of disappearing, may have to be reached. Relatively recent times of subspecies divergence and the merging of two subspecies in 2017, are additional considerations during such decision making processes (section \"Subspecies Definition and Divergence\"). This dilemma may have to be addressed for the Iranian population at some point if the numbers remain below 100 individuals (chapter 5). additional information on the genetic health of the existing population is critically and urgently needed to determine if this population is likely to survive without management actions.",

Breeding decisions are guided by the genealogical data managed through the regional and international cheetah studbooks (chapter 23). Reputable captive programs (chapter 22) aim to retain 90% of genetic diversity over 100 years (Lacy, 2012) . however, this may not be sufficient in the long term as the small number of founders only represents a subset of the genetic diversity found in the wild (founder effect) and the 10% genetic diversity lost is irreversible. This loss of diversity can only be compensated for by the recovery of lost breeding lines through \"reinjection\" of viably preserved reproductive material (e.g., gametes) of founders into the captive population, addition of new founder individuals (or gametes) obtained from the wild, or inclusion of unrelated captive individuals to the breeding pool. as with wild populations, interconnectivity of captive populations should be maintained as much as possible, through regional and interregional exchange of animals or reproductive material. as the cost of genetic research continues to decrease, it will provide the possibility to assess the genetic makeup of all captive cheetahs, and thus the integration of animals of unknown origin into the cheetah breeding pool, if genetic evaluation determines that they represent a new breeding lineage. Of note, inbred individuals (high homozygosity levels) can also be used for further breeding if they represent a unique breeding lineage, as homozygosity is not heritable.",

This in turn enables a joint message in terms of recommendations for cheetah conservation, as well as in situ and ex situ management (sections \"Genetic Diversity and In Situ cheetah conservation\" and \"Genetic Diversity and Ex Situ cheetah conservation\"). We hope that by presenting all available data on cheetah genetics, this chapter provides clarity to the results and conclusions arising from the field of conservation genetics, and contribute to the global efforts for the cheetah's long-term survival.",
