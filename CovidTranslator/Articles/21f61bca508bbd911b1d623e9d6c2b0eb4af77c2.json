            "text": "Terminology changes may affect reusability of data, hence the need for methods for managing changes. Along these lines, we have developed a formal representation of the concept-term relationship, around which we have also developed a methodology for management of terminology changes. We have implemented our methodology in a terminology maintenance tool. To evaluate our methodology, we compared two methods for retrieving ICD-9-CM data, based on their recall when retrieving data for ICD-9-CM terms whose codes had changed but which had retained their original meaning. Our results show that recall is either the same or better with a retrieval method that takes into account the effects of terminology changes. Statistically significant differences were detected (p<0.05) with the McNemar test for two terms whose codes had changed. Furthermore, when all the cases are combined in an overall category, our method 2 also performs statistically significantly better than default method (p < 0.05).",

These terminologies are useful for standardizing terms and encoding data and are used in many existing information systems. Therefore, large amounts of data have been recorded using these terminologies. Moreover, these terminologies evolve over time in order to suit the needs of users. As has been described before, there are a number of types of changes that occur in terminologies that can have an effect on the reusability of data that are encoded with these terminologies [1] . For example, when a major name change occurs, the term associated with a code changes so much that the meaning is essentially different, even as the code remains the same. Other types of changes include simple addition, refinement, deletion due to obsolescence, deletion due to redundancy, minor name change, precoordination, disambiguation, code change, and code reuse. In this article we focus on code change, which occurs when the code for a term changes but the term's meaning remains exactly the same. For example, in the 2005 version of ICD-9-CM, the code for \"Meconium aspiration syndrome\" is 770.1, but in the 2006 version, its code has been changed to 770.10. Recall can be decreased when searching for ICD-9-CMencoded data because when the code for a term changes, a retrieval method that does not properly manage the code change may miss cases that are encoded with the new code for the term.",

We used the tool to interface a domain ontology derived from SNOMED CT (2005) and parts of ICD-9-CM (1997 version). We also used the tool to handle successive changes to ICD-9-CM (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) . Then, as part of our evaluation of the methodology, we compared two information retrieval methods based on their performance on retrieving ICD-9-CM-encoded data after the occurrence of a code change. Method 1 (\"Default\") was based on a static view of the ICD-9-CM terminology (i.e. without regard for changes in concepts, terms, and codes); this is the approach typically used in retrospective studies [3] [4] [5] . Method 2 (\"Informed\") was based on an approach for managing ICD-9-CM that took into account the effects of terminological changes using an ontological view. In the case of a code change, Method 2 utilizes the information about the code change, so that searches against an ICD-9-CM-encoded database will retrieve cases with the new code as well as the old code. Since Method 1 does not utilize this information, only cases encoded with the old code will be retrieved.",

A negative case was defined as a case where the diagnosis was not given by the primary physician. The raters' responses were dichotomized into the two categories in three different ways.

The recall performance of Methods 1 and 2 on each code change were compared using the McNemar Test, which is appropriate when the data consist of paired observations of nominal data [6] . Finally, in order to estimate the reliability of the measurement process, the judges were asked to give their responses to each case in a separate set of 96 cases. There were five (5) judges and three (3) categories (\"Yes\",\"Cannot tell OR Maybe yes\", and \"No\"). Inter-rater reliability was measured using an intraclass correlation coefficient (two-way mixed, single measures, absolute agreement -corresponding to Shrout and Fleiss's ICC(3,1) [7] ) using the SPSS statistical software program [8] . Table 1 shows the ten selected code changes. A total of 675 cases were retrieved by the screening process and were presented to the judges. Two of the judges had finished 3 years of specialty training in Internal Medicine, 1 judge had finished 1 year of specialty training in Internal Medicine, and 1 judge had finished medical school. Table 2 shows the results of measuring the recall performance of Methods 1 and 2 on the code changes. The results show that Method 2 performed significantly better (p<0.05) than Method 1 for 2 of the ICD-9-CM terms whose codes had changed (Code changes 3 and 9), regardless of how judges' responses were dichotomized in the reference standard. For a third code change (Code change 8), Method 2 performed better than Method 1 using dichotomization 3. Finally, when all the cases were combined in an \"overall\" category, Method 2 also performed statistically significantly better (p < 0.05) than Method 1. The calculated interclass correlation coefficient was sufficiently large at 0.599 (95% CI 0.503, 0.689).

Furthermore, the method also handles other types of terminology changes that are not solved by simply querying for the class. For example, in major name changes, the meaning of the term/code changes but the code remains the same. Our method allows for the representation and handling of these kinds of changes.",

It is not hard to understand why Method 2's recall performance can be significantly better for terms whose codes have changed. Even though there is bound to be some lag between the official start date of a code change in ICD-9-CM and full compliance with that change, over time, human coders will become better at using the new (and correct) code for the diagnosis. A method that did not take into account code changes would miss more cases with the correct diagnosis, since the method would not know that cases with the new code should be retrieved. On the other hand, a method that took into account the new code would retrieve cases with the old code (prior to the date when the change is enforced) as well as cases with the new code (subsequent to the date when the change is enforced).",

ICD-9-CM-encoded data is ubiquitous, as it is currently a part of reimbursement and reporting requirements, therefore, the results of this study are applicable to a broad range of areas such as quality assurance and clinical research. One limitation of the study is that ICD did not change as drastically as it has in past years, and so we were limited to studying code changes, and the measured difference in performance was relatively small.
