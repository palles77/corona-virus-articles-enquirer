Virus prevalence was higher in local camels than in imported camels (224 [47\u00b75%] of 472 vs 157 [13\u00b71%] of 1196; p<0\u00b70001). Infection prevalence peaked among camels older than 1 year and aged up to 2 years in both groups, with 255 (66\u00b79%) of 381 positive cases in this age group. Although the overall geographical distribution of the virus corresponded with the phylogenetic tree topology, some virus exchange was observed between countries corresponding with trade routes in the region. East and west African strains of the virus appear to be geographically separated, with an origin of west African strains in east Africa. African strains of the virus were not re-sampled in Saudi Arabia despite sampling approximately 1 year after importation from Africa. All local Arabian samples contained strains of the virus that belong to a novel recombinant clade (NRC) first detected in 2014 in Saudi Arabia. Reproduction number estimates informed by the sequences suggest sustained endemicity of NRC, with a mean R e of 1\u00b716. Interpretation Despite frequent imports of MERS-CoV with camels from Africa, African lineages of MERS-CoV do not establish themselves in Saudi Arabia. Arabian strains of the virus should be tested for changes in virulence and transmissibility.",

Despite many WHO scoping reviews and stake holder meetings defining urgent priority research needs, major knowledge gaps in the epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, and evolu tion of MERS-CoV remain. 1, 3 MERS-CoV seroprevalence among the general human population in Saudi Arabia is less than 0\u00b75%, although it is substantially higher in camel shepherds (2\u00b73%) and slaughterhouse workers (3\u00b76%). 4 MERS-CoV is highly prevalent in dromedary camels on the Arabian Peninsula and dromedary camels are the likely source of primary human MERS-CoV infections. 5 Serological and nucleic acid-based evidence suggests that dromedary camels from Africa and Asia have harboured MERS-CoV for more than 35 years. [6] [7] [8] The high diversity of MERS-CoV in African camels and the existence of a conspecific virus in African bats point to its geographical roots in Africa. [8] [9] [10] However, the geographical structure (in terms of phylogeography) of African MERS-CoV remains understudied.",

A large proportion of dromedary camels in the Middle East are imported from east African countries, where 19 million of the world's estimated population of 30 million dromedary camels reside. 11 MERS-CoV strains identified in African camels are genetically distinct from strains detected in camels in the Arabian Peninsula. 8, 9 In Africa, east and west African strains of MERS-CoV can be discriminated by their genetic markers that include accessory gene deletions that might affect the extent of virus replication or virulence. 8 Despite the continuous, extensive, and unidirectional export of African dromedaries, whether African MERS-CoV lineages reach the Arabian Peninsula and can be transmitted onward remains unknown. An important aspect of potential transmission is the age structure of imported camels, which are usually adult animals but can also include animals shipped towards the end of their first year of life. In large husbandries on the Arabian Peninsula, acute MERS-CoV infection mostly occurs in young camels younger than 1 year. 12 Age at the time of infection might differ among imported camels because of different husbandry practices across the distribution area, with additional effects due to cohorting and mixing during animal transportation. 11, 13 The seaport at Port of Jeddah, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, receives animals from east Africa linked with the major trading routes in the Horn of Africa, Egypt, and from the trading route in the Sahel region connected with regions in west Africa. 11 We undertook a study of the pattern of infection age, infection prevalence, and genetic diversity of MERS-CoV in camels being imported from Africa (Sudan and Djibouti) into the Port of Jeddah, the largest entry port of camels into Saudi Arabia. We also analysed the genetic diversity of the virus strains identified, and compared all virological characteristics of imported camels with local dromedaries sampled during the year after surveillance at the port.",

We used the term \"MERS*\" combined with any single other term from the following list: \"coronavirus*\", \"camels*\", \"dromedaries*\", \"recombinant*\", \"phylogeny*\", \"phylogeography\", \"Africa*\", \"sequenc*\", \"prevalence\", \"age\", and \"transmission\". Since the discovery of MERS-CoV in 2012, multiple sequencing studies have been done on viruses from camels and humans mainly in the Arabian Peninsula. Few studies exist on sequences from Africa, but all of these sequences are from camels rather than from humans, whereas most of the sequences from the Arabian Peninsula are from humans. Sampling bias is likely to affect all studies. The number of studies, and hence samples collected, from Africa is small compared with those from the Arabian Peninsula.",

By sampling before offloading from ships we made sure to take samples from animals that came directly from Africa and had no contact with local camels in Saudi Arabia. To our knowledge, the resulting sample of African camel-borne MERS-CoV is the largest so far from the African continent. Our data enhance the overall picture of African strains of the virus, including the phylogenetic and geographical associations, which has enabled us to undertake comparisons of diversity against representatively large samples from the Arabian Peninsula. Our comparisons take sampling dates into account. We infer that Arabian and African strains of the virus have been separated for a time that exceeds the present observation period in all studies (ie, the virus strains have been separated since before 2012). We suggest that African strains of the virus are not transmitted in Arabian camels, despite large numbers of African camels frequently being imported into Saudi Arabia; and that Arabian strains of the virus might be self-sufficient in terms of their reproductive rate to maintain endemic circulation. By sampling from local camels in Saudi Arabia, we found that a novel clade of MERS-CoV that emerged in 2014 remains the only detected viral variant in camels from Saudi Arabia, suggesting that strains of this clade might be dominant over other viral strains that were coendemic in camels before 2014.",

The first cohort comprised dromedary camels imported into Saudi Arabia on incoming vessels from Sudan or Djibouti at the Port of Jeddah. Samples were obtained over an almost 2-year period and were collected from about 15% of all camels aboard a ship. Sampling took place by entering the animal compartment and sampling accessible animals at random. Often ships held camels in two separate compartments, and so for our study we took samples from camels in both compartments. The second cohort comprised local camels from herds in Jeddah and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Local samples were collected after the surveillance at the Port of Jeddah. In Jeddah, we collected 30% of samples from three camel farms approximately 45 km south of Jeddah and one farm approximately 50 km north of Jeddah, while we collected the other 70% of samples at an abattoir in the city before the camels were slaughtered. In Riyadh, we collected samples from camel farms and a camel market in a circle with a 60 km radius in and around the city.

One subclade, designated C1.1, was previously found to contain strains from west Africa including from Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Morocco (designated as C1 by Chu and colleagues 8 ). This clade has a novel sister clade here designated as C1.2, including sequences from Sudan and Djibouti found in the present study. With a similar internal diversity as clades C1.1 and C1.2, a novel subclade is identified, C2, that contains multiple novel viruses from the present study derived from Sudan and Djibouti, and viruses previously detected by us and others in Egypt, Ethiopia, and Kenya. 8, 9, 25 A strain previously detected in Egypt is highly distinct and designates a novel clade C3. 25 Deletions in the ORF4b region have occurred recently in parallel lineages of African strains of the virus but not Arabian strains (figure 1). Deletion types are specific for their respective clades, cluster with viral strains that carry wild-type ORF4b genes, and are highly region specific, indicating that geographical spread of these recent variants has not occurred (the topology of deletion type VII does not indicate convergence because it is merely deletion of one amino acid at the C-terminus). Viruses from Nigeria (C1.1) show particularly large deletions (types II-VI) that are not observed in other clades and suggest the geographical isolation of west African clades. Two sequences described in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (Bisha_1_2012; KF600620 and Riyadh_1_2012; KF600612.1) both belonging to clade B also show deletions (type 1) in ORF4b region, but with a distinct location.",

Because previous studies have shown that serotype discrimination does not exist between MERS-CoV clades, our findings suggests that viruses in Saudi Arabia can remain endemic without introduction of new strains from Africa. 8 Therefore, we focused on the reproductive rate of viruses in Saudi Arabia. Using a curated dataset of Arabian strains of the virus, we subjected all strains of the virus belonging to clade B, whether derived from humans or camels, to analyses of R e based on Bayesian birth death skyline analyses. We used this approach to obtain a dataset as complete as possible from a virus population that is close to the requirements of coalescent analysis-namely, panmixis and contingency as a population. Human-derived viral sequences were selected in such a way that they most likely represent primary cases; human-derived viruses were thus regarded as sentinels for enzootic evolution in camels, as previously reported. 23 We only used the non-recombinant part of clade A and B virus genomes for this analysis because all recent isolates belonged to the NRC. The overall estimate of R e had a mean of 1\u00b716, compatible with sustained endemicity. R e increased in the period between early 2017 and the middle of 2018, which we associate with the increased sampling effort by our study. We undertook two analyses of R e , one not including the novel viruses identified in this study (figure 3A) and the other including the full curated dataset (figure 3B). By omitting the new sequences, the R e of MERS-CoV seems to decrease over time, highlighting that inclusion of new sequences is important to maintain an accurate picture of viral spread. Notably, this result is subject to previous assumptions made in our analyses.",

By analysing a large number of strains of MERS-CoV imported into Saudi Arabia from major African trade ports, we showed that Arabian strains of the virus are isolated from African strains and identify African MERS-CoV clades that were not as clearly distinguished in previous studies. Although all African strains of the virus share common ancestors in east Africa, only clade C1 presently appears in west and north Africa. Even if all African clades are represented in east Africa, no single place sampled so far in east Africa represents the whole diversity of MERS-CoV variants. Phylogeographical and social network analyses suggest that the present distribution of African clades is not predominantly shaped by transregional exchange but mainly reflects the phylogenetic tree structure. Camel trade, such as via the Sahel route connecting east and west Africa, corresponds with the present location of C1.1 strains but does not seem to cause a bidirectional exchange of strains between east and west Africa. Only for the clustering of Moroccan with west African strains and some strains from Kenya and Djibouti, the geographical distance between sites exceeds that of the attributed genetic distance, suggesting recent exchange through trade routes. Our phylogenetic tree structure shows that only parts of the diversity of clades C1 and C3 are represented in Sudan. Recombination between these clades is not observed, despite co-occurrence in Sudan. Therefore, Sudan appears to be a frequent recipient of viral lineages from other regions although we did not identify any strictly Sudan-specific lineages.",

            "text": "For African strain of the virus, our data confirm that the genome regions coding for the ORF4b and ORF3 regions have genetic instability. ORF4b encodes a phospho diesterase that degrades 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate and thereby prevents the activation of RNase L, an important cellular antiviral effector. 28, 29 The importance of this function for the spread of MERS-CoV and its ability to infect organisms under natural conditions is of interest. In-vitro studies suggest an attenuation of replication in viruses whose ORF4b region has undergone deletions. 8 One could speculate that slightly deleterious mutants can sustain themselves better in socalled sink populations, whereas in source populations they would typically be out-competed by non-deleted strains that have higher reproductive fitness. Our data in combination with those of Chu and colleagues 8 suggest that sink populations of MERS-CoV are hosted by west African camels and the possible geographical origin of all African MERS-CoV clades, thus the socalled source population is found in east Africa. The lesser density of camels in west Africa than in east Africa and the Arabian Peninsula supports the idea of an evolutionary dead end for MERS-CoV in that region. Particularly, Nigeria could be considered a dead end or sink area given the reduced density of camels towards the tropical zone of west Africa. For the strains of the virus detected in Saudi Arabia, our study suggests that Arabian and African viruses have been separated for a time that exceeds the present observation period in all studies (ie, viruses have been separated since before 2012). Despite the steady import of clade C viruses, these African lineages do not appear to establish them selves in Saudi Arabia. We were surprised to see a similar age structure of imported compared with local virus-positive camels, suggesting that age-related contact barriers in husbandry would not explain the absence of transmission; however, notably, approximately 15% of sampled animals were of unknown age. Future studies to understand barriers to transmission should examine local camel populations in direct contact with imported camels, including their susceptibility based on serological testing.",
