Trust and solidarity is advocated between healthcare leaders, healthcare professionals, and patients. 3 Public health policies need to respond with proportionate impact in a timely and equitable manner. 4 Policies need to be transparent and open to the scrutiny of healthcare workers, and healthcare workers need to be informed and updated during the pandemic. 3 Health leaders need to facilitate emergency pandemic medical education to healthcare workers during a pandemic. In a pandemic situation, strained resources need to be allocated in an equitable manner. The World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Collaborating Centre for Health Public Policy (NCCHPP) advocate reciprocity for those who respond to the epidemic and expose themselves to greater risk. [4] [5] [6] Decisions need to be based on evidence, principles, and values. However, in the era of evidence-based medicine, public health decisions are not always supported by evidence but by expert opinion. Although the decisions may be potentially contrary to their personal opinion, anesthesia providers are expected to follow and endorse these recommendations.",

            "text": "''When pestilence is upon the people it is their duty (physicians) to continue their work for the alleviation of suffering even at the jeopardy of their lives'' Canadian Medical Association Code of Ethics 1922. 3 The aftermath of Toronto's severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic stimulated much debate about this topic. Many healthcare professionals accepted the duty to care, and others adopted the libertarian stance and refused to provide care. 3 After the SARS epidemic, the CMA revised their Code of Ethics but unfortunately remained vague in the description of duties during an outbreak of a contagious pathogen. 3, 9 Clarke reviewed the American Medical Association Code of Ethics and identified three ethical arguments for duty to treat. (1) When the ability to render aid is greater, the obligation to assist is also elevated. (2) By freely joining a profession designed to combat disease, one consents to some standard of risk. (3) Realize that the profession has flourished due to socially negotiated promises to be available in such times of duress. 11 Following this ideology, anesthesia providers who freely join a potentially high-risk specialty accept a heightened risk to themselves. Furthermore, since anesthesia providers are well trained to treat the complications of Ebola, they are held more accountable to respond to the epidemic. 10, 11 Contrary to these strong beliefs, Norman Daniels, a prominent ethicist, considers this notion, i.e., that physicians are held accountable to accept any personal risk, to be unfounded. 11 Daniels argues that physicians do consent to some degree of ''standard risk''; however, there are limitations to the degree of risk. Furthermore, Sokol and the WHO support the idea that ''duty of care is not limitless'', often contrary to common belief. 4, 12 Unfortunately, we do not know the risks of treating Ebola in a Canadian context, and therefore, it is difficult to decide whether it falls within a ''standard risk''. Another opinion held by many ethicists is that physicians are accountable to a ''moral minimum'' or ''minimally decent Samaritan'' when there is an urgent need to minimize the suffering of a person. 11, 13 ''Moral minimum'' and ''standard risk'' are not set norms; they are thresholds that will vary among physicians. A ''standard risk'' or a ''moral minimum'' may be discussed among anesthesiologists and within anesthesia departments during pandemic preparation.",

Anesthesia departments should be prepared to respond to the pandemic effectively and in unison. Anesthesiologists should review ethical concerns in advance in case they are called for duty.
