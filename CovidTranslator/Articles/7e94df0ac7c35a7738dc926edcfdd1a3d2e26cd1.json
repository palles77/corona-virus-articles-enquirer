The results demonstrated that the virions contained three distinct proteins: the two related chains of the E2 complex, the nucleocapsid protein and the heterogeneous E1 complex. Five distinct virus-specific proteins were synthesized by infected cells. Three of the five intracellular proteins contained tryptic-peptides with properties similar to the three structural proteins. Models describing the evolution of the proteins are proposed. Although the pathogenic properties of MHV-JttM and MHV-A59 differ greatly, the tryptic peptide maps of the corresponding proteins of these MHV strMns were remarkably similar. 334 C.W. BOND, K.

Two proteins that migrated slightly faster than the nueleocapsid proteins (MHV-A59: p57, p54; MItV-JHM: p61, p56) were regularly detected in infected cell lysates (Fig. 2, ref. 2, 3) . The structures of the three intraeellular proteins N-60K, p57, p54 and the virion nucleocapsid protein N-60K were compared by tryptic peptide mapping (Fig. 4) as were the corresponding proteins of MHV-JHM (Fig. 5) . The tryptic peptide maps of the virion and intraeellular nueleoeapsid proteins were nearly identical. The same conclusion was drawn from the tryptie peptide maps of the corresponding MHV-JHM proteins. Although the molecular weights of the MHV-nueleocapsid proteins differed by a significant amount, the positions of the peptides in the maps were remarkably similar. The structure of the E 1-22 kilodMton protein from MHV-A59-infected cells was compared to the structure of the E 1 proteins of the MHV-A59 virus particle (Fig. 6) . The virion-associated E 1 protein was heterogeneous by S D S -P A G E (Fig. 1) . F o u r fractions of the E 1 complex from virus particles corresponding to 22, 24, 25 and 26 kilodMtons were analyzed (Fig. 6, panels A, B, C, D respectively) . The peptide map of the intracellular E 1-22K protein (panel E) was similar to the peptide map of the structural E i -2 2 K protein (panel A) suggesting t h a t the peptide structure of the proteins were the same. The E 1 proteins of M H V -J H M were analyzed in the same m a n n e r (Fig. 7) . The E 1 -2 3 K and E 1 -2 2 K intraeellutar proteins were b o t h analyzed (panels E, F). The peptide maps of these two proteins were similar. The maps of the 4 size classes of structural E 1 proteins (panels A, B, C, D) were similar to each other and to the 2 intracellular species. The peptide maps suggest that the intraeellular E1 protein(s) was the precursor to the structural E 1 proteins in the MHV virus particles. The differences in size of the E 1-22K protein compared to the larger E 1 species (24 to 26 kilodaltons) may be due to differential glyeosylation of the E 1-22K protein. The positions of the peptides in the maps of the MHV-A59 E 1 proteins (Fig. 6) were similar to those of the MHV-JHM E 1 proteins (Fig. 7) . The peptide maps of the MHV-A59 specific intraeellular proteins p14 and p35 (Fig. 8, panels b, d) demonstrated that the 2 proteins were unrelated to each other or to any of the other MHV-A59 specific proteins. The peptide maps of the corresponding MHV-JHM specific proteins (Fig. 8 , panels a, c) indicated that these proteins were also unrelated to each other or to any of the other MHV-JHM specific proteins. However, the positions of the peptides in the maps of p i 4 (Fig. 8, panels a, b) and p35 (Fig. 8 , Origins are indicated by asterisks panels c, d) suggested that the peptide structures of the corresponding proteins of the two strains of MHV were similar.",

The map of E2-t50K was somewhat more complex than the maps of E2-90K or E2-180K, suggesting that the protein E2-150K may be processed by cleavage during maturation. A 180 kilodalton protein was detected in MHV-infected DBT celt lysates (Fig. 2) . We have not detected this species in MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cell tysates (2, 3) . The reason for this observation is not known. LEIBOWlWZ et al. (13) demonstrated by immunoprecipitation with a monospecific antiserum that a 120 kilodalton protein synthesized in a cell-free system primed with MHV-A59 mRNA shared determinants with E2-150K. A 120 kilodalton protein has been detected in immunoprecipitates of MHVinfected cells treated with tunieamyein, an inhibitor of dolichol-mediated glycosylation (8, 18, 21) . STU~MA~ and HOL~Es (27) demonstrated that the MHV-A 59 structural proteins E 2-t 80 K and E 2-90 K shared peptides on the basis of tryptic peptide maps. ]?urthermore, these workers have suggested that treatment of MHV-A 59 particles with trypsin results in the cleavage of E2-180K to two 90 kilodalton species (25, 26, 27) . This result indicates the presence of a trypsin-sensitive site near the midpoint of the molecule. The results of this study coupled with the results of others (8, 13, 18, t9, 20, 21, 25, 26, 27) suggest two possible mechanisms for the maturation of the E2 protein. The 120 kilodalton primary gene product is glycosylated to the E2-150K species, cleaved to the E2-90K species and dimerized to the E2-180K species. In the alternative mechanism, the 120 kilodalton primary gene product may be glyeosylated to the E2-150K species, further glyeosylated to the E2-180K species and then cleaved at the trypsin-sensitive site near the midpoint of the molecule to form two E2-90K species with different primary structures. Resolution of the mechanism will require an analysis of the primary structure of each species of protein. The extensive glyeosylation of the primary gene product may prevent complete tryptic digestion of the proteins for the mapping studies. This suggestion is supported by the observation that a large proportion of the sample remained at the origin of the maps in Fig. 3 , panels A, B and C. C.W. BOND, K. ANDERSON, and J. L. LEIBOWITZ:",

In addition, 2 more rapidly migrating species (MHV-A59: p57, p54; MItV-JHM: p61, p56), which were found only in infected cells, had tryptic peptide maps similar to the nucleocapsid proteins. There was also tryptic peptide homology between the N-60K nucleocapsid and p57 proteins synthesized by cell-free translation of MHV-A59 mRNA (13) . The more rapidly migrating species may be a result of proteolysis following celt lysis (1, 2t), prematur.e termination of transcription (13) or a result of posttranslational processing of the nucleocapsid protein. The function of the more rapidly migrating species related to the nucleocapsid proteins is not known.",

Since the tryptic peptide maps of these E 1 species are similar and coupled with the data from our other study (2), a model for the maturation of the E 1 species may be proposed. The primary gene product, E 1-23K is translated, cleaved to the E 1-22K species and then differentially glycosylated to the heterogeneous E 1 complex found in the virion. The glycosylation is resistant to tnnicamycin (8, 14, 18) and has been found to be of the O-linkage type (14) . The corresponding proteins in the virions of avian infectious bronchitis virus also have a common primary sequence and are differentially glycosylated (4, 23) .",
