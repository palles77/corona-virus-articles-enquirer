Approximately 70 to 80 per cent of RBCs were liberated within 30 minutes at 37 \u00b0 C while the liberation at 20\u00b0C progressed slowly. Therefore, the cell surfaces of DVIM-induced syncytia exhibit the same H A and RDE-like activities associated with virions.

This implies that hemadsorption of DVIM does not correspond to \"pseudo-hemadsorption\" described by BUCKNALL et al. (3) .

The hemagglutinating ability of 0C-43 required several passages in suckling mouse brain (12) , and Massachusetts strain of IBV (1) required both sucrose gradient purification and digestion with phospholipase C for activation. The HA of DVIM, reported here, was detectable directly in the culture fluid. The ratio of infectivity to HA varied between 1.2 and 3.1 \u00d7 104 TCID50/ 0.1 ml/HA unit. DVIM hemagglutinated the RBCs of only two species tested, while other coronaviruses, 0C-43, HEV and IBV, were less specific.

The instability of HA and hemadsorption at 20 \u00b0 C suggests that a viral enzyme may be responsible for uncoupling the virus from the red blood cell receptor. The possible enzymatic activity of DVIM was demonstrated on homologous virus receptors of mouse RBCs without any effect on receptors for heterologous viruses, Influenza-A and HVJ. Furthermore, it was also shown that bacterial neuraminidase (RDE) had no effect at all on the receptor for DVIM; nevertheless, the receptors for influenza-A viruses were destroyed by the same treatment. Additionally, even after purification through a sucrose density gradient, DVIM retains its receptor-destroying activity, thereby showing that this activity is viral-specific and associated with virions. Our preliminary results strongly suggest the existence of some type of receptor-destroying enzyme such as that of Influenza C virus (10, 13).",

The classification of the polypeptides of D V I M as glyco-or glycolipoprotein m u s t be considered as tentative at this point since the chemical nature of these complexes cannot be precisely defined by differential staining techniques. The number and size of gtyeoproteins of eoronaviruses which have been reported previously b y m a n y investigators, were shown to vary. I t appears t h a t our V P I (MW 139,000) corresponds to a large polypeptide (MW 150,000--200,000) reported for other coronaviruses (4, 8, 9, 15, 16, 19, 24, 25, 27) , because it is glyeosylated and appears to be situated on the surface of the virion. Other D V I M virion polypeptides also appear to be surface glyeoproteins. Furthermore, some of the investigators agree t h a t coronaviruses contain a polypeptide having an a p p r o x i m a t e molecular weight of 50,000, corresponding to our VP3, which is not glyeosylated and tends to comprise a large proportion of the virus protein (4, 15, 19, 25) . Polypeptide VP3 represents 26 percent of virus protein and is not affected b y bromelain digestion at all. This suggests t h a t V P 3 is also located in the \"inner core\" (5, 19, 25) of the virion.
