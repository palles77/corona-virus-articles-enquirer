Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are associated with significant morbidity and are the commonest reason for outpatient visits and hospitalizations among young children [2, 3] . Viruses are a leading cause of ARTIs with an epidemiological variability depending on climate, season and regions [4] . Viral aetiology is still unclear in a significant proportion of ARTIs and the role of viral co-infections is controversial [5, 6] . During the past decade, new respiratory viruses, such as human metapneumovirus and human bocavirus, have been discovered. The impact of these viruses on the global epidemiology of ARTIs has not been fully elucidated [7, 8] . Moreover, human rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, previously identified in childhood upper respiratory tract infections, have been suspected as major aetiological agents of lower respiratory tract infections like bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants [9, 10] .",

The presence of inhibitors of the enzyme mixture (reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase) in samples in which virus detection is going to be performed (sputum, respiratory secretions etc.) is another possible explanation. Nevertheless, the assay used in our study eliminated such false negatives with the addition of an internal control that was extracted along with any possible viruses present in the sample and was subsequently amplified in the reaction tubes, confirming the correct efficiency of both the extraction and the PCR amplification [15] .",

Other researchers found that children with HMPV/RSV co-infection were more likely to develop pneumonia, but they did not manifest increased disease severity as defined by the duration of hos-pitalization and need for oxygen supplementation [26] .
