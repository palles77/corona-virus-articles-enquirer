            "text": "Surveys, focus groups, and accreditation processes conducted in Southeastern Ontario in 1998e2000 identified gaps in the provision of optimal palliative care. Findings indicated minimal use of assessment tools; lack of evidence-based practice(s); discomfort of family physicians in managing symptoms of advanced illness; inconsistent symptom management practices; discontinuity of care at critical transition points; need for coordination and communication among health care providers/ services; lack of awareness and/or underutilization of available resources; and unmet patient and family needs. 1e5 Other Canadian studies found similar limited integration between care providers and facilities 3,4 that had resulted in late referrals, unnecessary delays for treatment or transfer to an appropriate setting of care, and unnecessary suffering and cost. 2e4 In response, a group of administrative and clinical leaders within palliative medicine, the regional cancer center, and local health organizations from Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox & Addington (KFL&A) counties came together to investigate the possibility of establishing a Palliative Care Program. A decision was made at the onset that the immediate focus would not be on program governance, (infra)structure, or developing an entirely ''new palliative program,'' but rather, on optimizing existing clinical services, resources, and funding through the development and implementation of a quality improvement project, the Palliative Care Integration Project (PCIP). The PCIP would serve as the basis for the development of more integrated clinical relationships, and thus efficient and effective client care. The intention was that the PCIP ''project'' format would eventually transition to a ''program'' and expand into surrounding regions in Southeastern Ontario.",

This included 1347 cancer patients followed by community care (KFL&A Community Care Access Centre [CCAC]), Queen's Palliative Care Medicine and the complex continuing care palliative care unit (St. Mary's of the Lake Hospital), an acute care hospital (Kingston General Hospital) , and a regional cancer center (Cancer Centre of Southeastern Ontario) during the calendar years of 2001e2003. A detailed description of this target population is provided in the PCIP outcome evaluation article. 6 The KFL&A counties, located in Southeastern Ontario, Canada, cover approximately 6660 km 2 . These counties are a mixture of relatively small urban areas, small rural towns, and hamlets. At the time of the development and implementation of the PCIP, there were approximately 190,000 people living in the region (114,200 in the largest city, Kingston); 7 over 500 practicing physicians (approximately 200 general practitioners); two tertiary acute care hospitals (with one palliative care consult service but no acute care designated palliative care units); one community hospital; a regional cancer center (3000 new patients per year, one palliative care clinic); and a complex continuing care hospital (housing a six-bed palliative care unit). Community-based nursing care was delivered primarily by two agencies contracted for service by one CCAC. Within all of these health care sectors, care for palliative patients was provided by a mix of regulated nurses and unregulated health care providers. Many members of this frontline staff were not designated within a ''palliative care staff or team,'' but rather, were among a staff roster that changed from shift to shift and day to day.",

During the summer of 2003, the Steering Committee began work with the District Health Council to prepare for the rollout of the PCIP to the neighboring counties of Southeastern Ontario. In 2004, with funding support from the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care of Ontario, expansion into the neighboring counties began.",

The Cancer Centre of Southeastern Ontario and the KFL&A CCAC, with funding from Cancer Care Ontario's (CCO) Innovation Fund, developed touch-screen kiosk computer technology to capture ESAS scores of patients attending clinics in the cancer center and secure Internet technology and touchtone telephone technology to capture symptom and functional assessments from patients at home. If scores were more than a designated threshold, as determined by the professional caregivers, then appropriate health care professionals were automatically notified. 10 A Fatigue CCP was developed by a 23-person interdisciplinary team from across the South East region of Ontario. Fatigue is the most common symptom of oncology patients and others living with palliative needs. A literature review was completed in December 2004. Development of the Fatigue CCP was completed by September 2005.",

It involved the endorsement and implementation of common assessment tools, the development and implementation of CCPs and SMGs, and the evaluation of the processes and outcomes related to the project. There were nearly 100 individuals from over 30 different organizations who actively participated in bringing it to fruition. Although we cannot say that all outcomes are attributable to the project alone, the evaluation of administrative data showed that across the three-year study period, there was evidence of improvement in efficiencies in patient care, for example, a consistent decrease in the length of stay, reduced visits to the Emergency Department, and an increase in home or nonacute care facility deaths. In addition, there were improvements in patient symptom intensity, although these were not statistically significant. 6 Our findings showed that a multi-institutional and multisectoral network, in which each organization had ownership and where no organization lost its autonomy, was an effective and successful way to build relationships among organizations and to improve integration of care delivery. Our keys to success included strong, upper-level administrative leadership from the key organizations providing palliative care in the region; strong clinical leadership; a dedicated Project Coordinator who was a member of all expert working groups, and therefore, provided continuity; and broad membership of all working groups in both the development and implementation planning to establish ''buy-in/ownership'' early in the process. A project of this magnitude, involving multiple sites, disciplines, and geography, required open communication, objectives (short, interim, and long term), and a strong commitment to continuous collaboration and quality improvement. The PCIP was successful as well, because it addressed identified gaps in the provision of optimal palliative care for the patient.",

Projects that involve multiple sites and people should probably anticipate significant delays when determining evaluation timelines. When the project was evaluated, the processes regarding documentation within and between sites of care had not been addressed. This meant that some of the outcomes were not captured.

Based on the feedback of the pilot study, the assessment tools CCPs and SMGs were changed for easier access and integration. The feedback led to the development of a pocket version of the SMGs (September 2003), a laminated ESAS/PPS pocket-sized assessment card (2004), and a pocket or ''Lite'' version of the CCPs (2005).",

The full text of the article was retrieved and reviewed if it met the inclusion criteria.The Dyspnea CCP and SMG development was aided by a literature search in MEDLINE, AIDSLine, HealthSTAR, Cancerlit, and the Clinics of North America series for the period 1966 to December 4, 2000 . Initially, all articles found under the MeSH heading ''dyspnea'' and ''palliative care'' were reviewed. This permitted an overview of common management strategies for dyspnea. Further searches using ''dyspnea'' and the MeSH heading most appropriate to the management strategy were then done. Articles that addressed management were assessed. Bibliographies were reviewed to find articles not identified in searches. Where appropriate, each article was critically appraised using the JAMA Critical Appraisal series as a guide.",
