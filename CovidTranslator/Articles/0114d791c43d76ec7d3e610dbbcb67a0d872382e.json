In view of these facts it is perhaps surprising that virologists have only in the course of the last few years begun to examine negatively stained faecal extracts for viruses by electronmicroscopy, since the techniques employed were available 20 years ago. However, virologists did not employ them to examine faecal extracts, perhaps because they thought that if viruses were implicated in acute gasitroenteiitis,the number of particles would be below the critical level for electronmicroscopy. Indeed, it was veterinary workers who blazed the trail by detecting rotaviruses in the stools of animals with acute enteritis some 4-5 years before medical virologists did among children.",

Not only are rotaviruses detected in different animals morphologically identical but common antigens are shared. Thus antigens associated with the inner capsid are group specific whereas antigens associated with the outer capsid are species specific. , 1975] . Children between the ages of 6 months to 3 years are most commonly affected. Highest levels of virus are excreted between the second and fourth day of illness (up to 10^\u00b0 particles/g faeces] but a week or so after the onset of symptoms very little virus is present. However, patients with immuno deficiency disorders may experience diarrhoea and virus excretion over a period which may extend for many months (Saulsbury, F.T., Winkelstein, J.\u0391., Yolken, R.H. 1980] .

Oral admini stration of astrovirus-containing faecal filtrates to adult volunteers, may result in virus excretion, an immune response and the development of mild gastro intestinal symptoms (Reed, S.E., Kurtz, J.B., Lee, T.W. 1978] . Astroviruses have also been identified in the stools of lambs with diarrhoea and in calf faeces, but studies by immune electronmicroscopy suggest that the strains are not related antigenically.",

By 1979 this had fallen to 3,300 cases, a reduction of over 85%. Most of this reduction can be attributed to the declining incidence of hepatitis A virus infections(Galbraith, N.S.,  Forbes, P., Mayon-White, R.T. 1980). Since a high proportion of young adults in the U.K. are susceptible, it is important that they should be protected from hepatitis A virus infection by the passive administration of pooled normal human immunoglobulin prior to visiting hepatitis A virus endemic parts of the world.VIRUSES CAUSING ACUTE GASTROENTERITISRotaviruses and parvovirus-like viruses undoubtedly cause acute gastroenteritis. However, the role of such other viruses as adenoviruses, astroviruses, calici viruses and coronaviruses are perhaps less well established although it now seems probable that enteric adneovirus, astrovirus and caliciviruses may from time to time be associated with cases or outbreaks of acute diarrhoeal disease.Rotaviruses are the commonest cause of acute non-bacterial disease in infancy and childhood. The virus particles are approximately 70 nm in diameter, contain double stranded RNA and represent a separate genus in the family of reoviridae. The virus particle has a double capsid layer, having a sharply defined smooth rim [outer capsid) surrounding spoke-like sub-units [inner capsid) which radiate outwards from a hub-like core [Fig. 1c). Some virus particles may be devoid of the external capsid.Fig. 1d. Rotavirus (the outer capsid layer is present on all these particles]The accumulated data from a number of studies conducted in temperate climates has shown that rotaviruses may be detected in approximately 40-50% of infants admitted to hospital with acute diarrhoeal disease although in winter months the proportion may rise to 70-80% (Davidson, G.P., Bishop, R.F., Townely, R.R.W., and others",

U.S. workers employing enzyme immuno assay have shown that their two major subtypes have a world wide distribution and that sequentially acquired infections are usually the result of infection by a different serotype. Infection caused by one subtype does not appear to protect against infection by the other. It appears that infection by both serotypes occurs early in life throughout the world for by approximately 18 months of age.",
