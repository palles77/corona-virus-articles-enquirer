Changes to nutritional 12 quality rather than quantity have been overlooked as a threat to bee health. Yet 13 knowledge of bee nutrition is currently largely restricted to adults of social species. 14 Larval stages, where most growth occurs, are relatively understudied -perhaps because 15 most social bees provision progressively and collectively, making nutrition difficult to 16 trace. 17 2. In mass-provisioning solitary bees (Osmia bicornis L.), we can manipulate and follow 18 larval nutrition, and thereby determine effects of changes in diet quality. Under the 19 Geometric Framework for Nutrition, we restricted larvae to 6 diets: 3 20 protein:carbohydrate ratios and 2 nutrient concentrations. We asked: (a) which diets 21 maximise body size and survival, (b) what consumption rules do larvae follow when 22 nutrients are imbalanced? Finally, (c) given a choice of complementary diets, are larvae 23 able to select a dietary balance? 24 3. Larvae pupated after consuming a fixed carbohydrate amount, but tolerated a wide range 25 of protein. Body size and survival were maximised on our lowest P:C ratio diet, and 26",

Many wild and domesticated bees have seen 46 marked declines in recent decades, with both significant range contractions and extinctions 47 maintain themselves (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012a) . Understanding how animals cope in a 66 changing nutritional environment requires us to understand not only how animals gather the 67 correct balance of nutrients they need, but also how they adjust their foraging when resources are 68 imbalanced (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012b) . 69 In bees, the larval stage is where almost all growth occurs (Nijhout et al., 2014) as well as distinctly different diet to adults, adults primarily feeding on nectar (although see Cane, 2016) 77 and larvae feeding almost solely on pollen (Muth et al., 2016) . 78 The Geometric Framework for Nutrition (GF) allows us to investigate foraging decisions 79 made by animals in multi-dimensional \"nutrient space\" (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012b, 80 1993). The GF can be used to determine an organism's intake target (the optimal amount and 81 balance of macronutrients that an animal should aim to consume in order to achieve maximal 82 fitness (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 1993) as well as how that target is achieved. Additionally, 83 we can use the GF to investigate the rule of compromise -that is, the rules governing 84 consumption that an animal uses when it is unable to reach its intake target with the nutritional 85 options available (e.g. Lee et al., 2004b; Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2001) . 86 The GF has provided profound insights into broad topics from ant agriculture (Shik et al., 87 2016) to human obesity (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2005) .

This means that nutritional insights 95 from GF studies into the parent-offspring relationship are currently limited. 96 In solitary bees, by contrast, typically each reproductive female provisions each of her 97 offspring individually with a single, independent \"pollen ball\" before sealing the cell and 98 leaving. This pollen ball contains all the resources that the larva will need to grow to adulthood. Scriber and Slansky, 1981) in order to determine 122 their rules of compromise and the diet composition that maximised fitness. In a second \"choice\" 123 phase, we then provided larvae with targeted choices between sets of two imbalanced diets that 124 differed in their P:C ratios to determine whether larvae consistently aim for an intake target.

Therefore, newly emerged larvae were left alone for two days before we 159 transferred them to a single-occupancy nest and assigned each to an experimental treatment.",

For both carbohydrate and protein we saw differences in consumption from what 298 would have been expected for each larva based on random consumption, and this effect was 299 dependent on the specific set of diet choices (carbohydrate: linear mixed models with ID as a 300 random effect and \"diet combination\" and \"random or observed\" as predictor variables; dropping 301 the interaction, \u03c7 2 =42.76, df=3, p<0.0001; protein: dropping the interaction, \u03c7 2 =16.91, df=3, 302 p<0.001, Fig. 7) . 303 Moreover, when visualised as the amounts of P and C consumed during each 48h 304 treatment period (Fig. 7a, b) , it is clear that larvae were achieving a degree of homeostasis in C 305 consumption compared to what would be expected under random consumption of each diet 306 choice (Fig. 7c, Fig. 7d ). In contrast, their consumption of P aligned very closely with what 307 would be expected under random consumption (Fig. 7) .

Nevertheless, (Bosch 341 and Vicens, 2005) found little correlation between body size in O.cornuta and fecundity, which 342 was instead more related to longevity and provisioning rate. It is also worth noting that although 343 we found that high carbohydrate increased cocoon weight we did not identify a fitness peak at 344 which cocoon weight was maximised. Further work could employ a wider range of diet ratios in 345 order to locate this. Although high-carbohydrate consumption increased survival to pupation, among those larvae 355 that ended up eating low quantities of carbohydrate, protein consumption mediated survival, with 356 those on higher protein diets (higher P:C) experiencing greater survival (Fig. 5) . This pattern Interestingly, when allowed to self-select their diets, O.bicornis larvae did not cluster in 380 nutritional space but were instead spread out along a P:C ratio of 1:1.8 (Fig. 6a) , approximately 381 according to overall diet concentration. Notwithstanding the variable amounts actually eaten, 382 assuming at least that this 1:1.8 ratio reflects the ratio of the larvae's true intake target, this (Fig. 2b) , they were clearly unable to compensate for the 396 reduced nutrient concentration, consuming less of each macronutrient than larvae fed more 397 concentrated diets (Fig. 2a) . Despite the fact that total food consumption was similar across 398 treatments in the choice phase (Fig. 6b) , larvae on less concentrated diets may have been unable 399 to reach the same point in nutritional space due to consumption rate limitations. Raubenheimer, 2012b). Larval bees feed on pollen, which is amongst the most protein-rich of 425 plant tissues (Mattson, 1980) , and, as such, carbohydrate may be the more limiting nutrient for 426 larvae. It is likely that starch, the standard form of digestible carbohydrate storage in pollen 427 (Pacini, 1996) , rarely exceeds the protein content of pollen; (Roulston and Buchmann, 2000) 428 found that average starch content of pollen ranged from 0-22%, considerably less than the range 429 for protein (2-60%; Roulston and Cane, 2000a) . Thus, the relative abundance of protein in pollen The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

In the no-choice treatment, larvae were restricted to one of six separate diets at 168 three different protein:carbohydrate (P:C) ratios (Diet A at two concentrations (90% or 70%, see table S1 for amounts of macronutrients). To our 170 knowledge there is no precedent for the composition of artificial pollen diets for larval solitary 171 bees, so these diet ratios were chosen based on a combination of the nutrient ratios in honeybee-172 collected pollen loads and published data for protein in O. bicornis pollen balls (Budde and 173 Lunau, 2007). All diets contained an equal amount of honeybee-collected pollen and honey to 174 which was added specific amounts of protein (micellar casein) and carbohydrate (trehalose), 175 creating differing P:C ratios. The two diet concentrations were achieved by adding sporopollenin 176 (see S1 for protocol), a major component of the outer wall of pollen considered largely 177 indigestible by bees (Nepi et al., 2005; Roulston and Cane, 2000a; Su\u00e1rez-Cervera et al., 1994).",

Although we did 313 not identify an optimal intake amount for either nutrient, carbohydrate was positively associated 314 with both cocoon weight and survival, and at low carbohydrate levels, survival instead became 315 dependent on protein. When larvae were given a choice of complementary foods, they partially intake of each food to compensate for the variation in nutrient content. In this 317 choice phase, although consumption of both protein and carbohydrate differed significantly from 318 expected based on random consumption of each diet choice, larvae did not converge on an intake 319 target as expected. Nevertheless, larvae converged on a common P:C ratio of approx. 1:1.8, and 320 showed tighter control over carbohydrate consumption than over protein consumption, adding 321 weight to the findings from the no-choice phase that suggest that O.bicornis larvae prioritise 322 carbohydrate over protein consumption. Here we argue that overwintering and the regulation of 323 the typically limiting nutrient may explain these findings.324Within the range of diets studied, cocoon weight was positively related to carbohydrate 325 consumed, with little influence of protein(Fig. 3). Increased body size is related to the size of326 nutrient stores in Osmia (Bosch et al., 2010) and other insects (Briegel, 1990; Hahn, 2005; 327 Strohm, 2000) -and may reflect the size of the fat body, where carbohydrate-derived fat is stored 328 in insects (Arrese and Soulages, 2010). The fat body is critically important to species such as O. 329 bicornis that undergo diapause -not only during diapause (Giejdasz and Wasielewski, 2017; 330 Wasielewski et al., 2013) but also afterwards (Hahn and Denlinger, 2007). It would now be 331 interesting to determine the specific relationships between larval nutrition and fat body size, 332 overwintering success and subsequent fitness in O. bicornis. It is also important to note that 333 increased body size may have several other benefits, e.g. larger females may be more robust to 334 changeable weather conditions (Bosch, 2008; Bosch and Vicens, 2005). Whilst carbohydrate-335 biased (and protein-poor) intake targets have traditionally been seen as detrimental to female 336 fitness (Lee et al., 2008), lipid is a key component in insect oocytes, comprising 30-40% of the 337 dry weight (Kawooya and Law, 1988; Ziegler and Van Antwerpen, 2006) of which the vast 338 majority comes from the fat body reserves of the female (Arrese and Soulages, 2010).

In vitro feeding 364 revealed that, at high carbohydrate, larval survival was dependent on the amount of dietary 365 protein, but at low carbohydrate survival was independent of protein. Larvae showed 366 significantly reduced survival on high carbohydrate, low protein diets and the highest growth 367 rates on diets that contained a medium level of protein but low carbohydrate -suggesting that368 worker recruitment could suffer in situations where protein is limited (Helm et al., 2017). The 369 reasons behind this stark difference are unclear but it is worth noting that honeybee workers have 370 a different role as adults from individuals of O.bicornis; all female O.bicornis are destined to be 371 reproductives, unlike the honeybee larvae in Helm et al's study. Additionally, the honeybee 372 larvae used in Helm et al's study were 'summer bees' (Steinmann et al., 2015) and therefore 373 would not need to accrue nutrient reserves in order to enter diapause over the winter. If nothing 374 else, these contrasting findings highlight not only the importance of understanding larval as well 375 as adult nutrition for our general understanding of bee health, but also that knowledge of the 376 nutritional ecology of more commonly studied social species cannot necessarily be applied to the 377 more numerous, mass-provisioning solitary bees that collectively provide the bulk of our 378 pollination services (Winfree et al., 2007).",

Although 406 adult workers of social bees have also been shown to prioritise carbohydrate over protein, their 407 need for protein is relatively low (Paoli et al., 2014b; Stabler et al., 2015), requiring large wide variation in dietary protein, such as we saw in O. bicornis larvae, is 413 typically seen in predators -both vertebrates,, e.g. cats (Hewson-Hughes et al., 2011) and mink 414 (Mayntz et al., 2009), and invertebrates (Kohl et al., 2015; Raubenheimer et al., 2007). However, 415 bees are considered herbivorous (Larkin et al., 2008); herbivores tend to have protein-based 416 decision rules, including pollen-foraging adult bumblebees (Vaudo et al., 2016) and many other 417 herbivores [e.g. caterpillars (Lee et al., 2002; VanOverbeke et al., 2017)] and also omnivores 418 [e.g. humans (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2005)]. While clearly not predators, bees do share a 419 common ancestor with predatory social wasps and ants (Johnson et al., 2013; Peters et al., 2011), 420 and ant workers have been shown to tolerate varying protein levels in favour of a carbohydrate 421 target (Dussutour and Simpson, 2009). Furthermore, \"nutrient-generalist\" species (i.e. those 422 which tolerate wide ranges of dietary compositions) tend to be more able to tolerate swings in the 423 particular nutrient which is least limiting (Raubenheimer and Simpson, 1999; Simpson and 424",

Given the natural variation in pollen protein content in the environment,439    bee parents may be able to sense the macronutrient composition of pollen directly at the flower440    and thus actively regulate the composition of pollen provisions they provide to offspring. Some 441 studies support this idea(Muth et al., 2016;Ruedenauer et al., 2016Ruedenauer et al., , 2015, yet many studies442 have found otherwise (Konzmann and Lunau, 2014; Roulston and Cane, 2002; Roulston and 443 Cane, 2000b; for review, see Nicholls and Hempel de Ibarra, 2016). Conceivably, though, adults 444 may instead simply collect pollen for young indiscriminately, relying on (1) larval tolerance of 445 varying protein (this study), which may carry costs unmeasured here, and (2) variation in pollen 446 quality balancing out owing to the historically rich diversity of the floral environment 447 (Bukovinszky et al., 2017). In modern agricultural landscapes, where floral diversity is reduced 448 in favour of brief gluts of monotonous crops, this strategy may no longer be effective and may 449 indeed be deleterious. Under this scenario, the ways larvae deal with excesses and deficiencies of 450 protein would be of paramount importance for bee health. With few exceptions (see Helm et al., 451 2017), we know very little about larval nutrition in bees as most studies focus on adults, whether 452 foraging for nectar (Altaye et al., 2010; Kriesell et al., 2017; Paoli et al., 2014a; Ruedenauer et reach adulthood are accrued during the larval stage, and (2) larvae and adults have 456 different nutritional requirements (Cridge et al., 2017), the way larval bees deal with 457 macronutrient imbalances is a considerable knowledge gap. In particular, further studies that 458 assess whether O.bicornis larvae employ post-ingestive processing to regulate protein intake, as 459 shown in some other insects (Lee et al., 2004a; Raubenheimer and Simpson, 2003; Rho and Lee, 460 2017; Telang et al., 2001), may help to explain the large variation of protein tolerated by larvae. 461 That (1) larvae seem not to regulate protein, (2) parents are likely unable to assess protein 462 content for their young, and (3) human activity, particularly intensive agriculture, is reducing 463 floral diversity, potentially make for a toxic combination for bees. Changes to the composition of 464 available nutrition, driven by loss of floral diversity (Goulson et al., 2015), or potentially through 465 changes in the nutritional composition of pollen within a plant species in response to human 466 activity (Ziska et al., 2016), may cause mother bees to unwittingly feed their offspring nutrient-467 deficient diets. This would mean that, despite otherwise favourable environments, O.bicornis and 468 possibly bees more generally, would become caught in a \"nutritional trap\", gathering food that 469 no longer provides offspring with appropriate nutrition. More research is needed into the 470 nutrition of larval bees, especially solitary species where knowledge is sparse, in order to inform 471 conservation management and stewardship schemes. Further studies should focus on whether 472 larval bees have physiological adaptations to overcome nutrient imbalances, e.g. post-ingestive 473 processing, and whether mother bees are able to adjust the provisions they provide their 474 offspring in order to counter changing nutritional composition of pollen available in the 475 environment.",

Bee larvae are typically entirely sedentary and parents supply all their nutritional 105 demands (Field, 2005). Yet we have little knowledge about whether parent bees consistently 106 provide offspring with a ready-balanced diet, whether pollen ball composition varies passively 107 with the flowers available to foraging adults in the landscape, or somewhere in between. Adults forage in a heterogenous nutritional environment, but we know that, despite this, honeybee 109 foragers are nevertheless able to collect food that balances out deficiencies in colony nutrients (Hendriksma and Shafir, 2016). In general, though, evidence is scarce and mixed on whether adult bees can directly detect pollen quality at the flower (Nicholls and Hempel de Ibarra, 2016). Given that parents may bring pollen of variable quality, the question of whether offspring 113 are able to regulate their own nutrition to compensate for deficiencies in their provisions is a fundamental, but overlooked, component of bee nutrition. Even if parents cannot provide consistently balanced nutrition, larvae may still be able to eat selectively in order to achieve a nutritional target. Such regulation has been demonstrated in other insect larvae that develop independently of parents (Lee et al., 2002; Merkx-Jacques et al., 2008) but is unstudied in bees. We used a classic GF design (Jensen et al., 2012) with two experimental phases: in the 119 first \"no-choice\" phase we raised O. bicornis larvae on fixed diets of differing protein to 120 carbohydrate (P:C) ratios (two macronutrients regarded as critical to insects; Behmer, 2009; Clissold and Simpson, 2015; Huang, 2012;",

Given the traditionally assumed 128 importance of protein for growth and reproduction in insects and animals generally (Chapman and Chapman, 1998; Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012a), we predicted (1) that protein would be 130 a key driver of fitness in larval O. bicornis, (2) that larvae would accordingly aim for a relatively protein-biased intake target, and (3) that larvae would prioritize protein intake over carbohydrate 132 in their rule of compromise. Alternatively, among bees such as Osmia that undergo diapause over winter, carbohydrate may also be important in building up sufficient fat reserves for 134 overwinter survival (Arrese and Soulages, 2010; Giejdasz and Wasielewski, 2017).Osmia bicornis is a common, univoltine, cavity-nesting solitary bee native to Europe",
