            "text": "The primary target in multiple sclerosis (MS) is believed to be either myelin itself (myelinopathy) or the myelin-forming cell, the oligodendrocyte (oligodendrogliopathy). Although axonal injury occurs in MS, it is regarded as a secondary event to the myelin damage. Here, the lesion develops from myelin (outside) to the axon (inside) (Outside-In model). Recently, gray matter lesions and axonal injury in normal-appearing white matter have also been reported in MS. This raises two questions. 1) Is axonal injury exclusively secondary to myelin damage or from a direct insult to the axon or neurons (axonopathy)? (2) Is the injured axon regarded as only an end result of pathology or disease, or can axonal injury contribute to the spread of secondary damage, including demyelination? The former is raised from the fact that axonal damage has been reported in several virus infections, including human immunodeficiency virus, human T-lymphotropic virus 1, herpes simplex virus and coronavirus, which also cause demyelination. The latter possibility where axonal injury leads to other changes is raised from the rather unexpected similarity between spinal cord injury (SCI) and MS where axonal injury, oligodendrocyte apoptosis and demyelination are all present. In SCI, transection of axons leads to delayed oligodendrocyte apoptosis with secondary demyelination. Neurofilament immunostaining of spinal cord sections demonstrates that axonal injury with oligodendrocyte apoptosis also precedes demyelination in an animal model for MS, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection. This implies that axonal injury could trigger demyelination. In this instance, lesions develop from the axon (inside) to the myelin (outside) (Inside-Out model).",

In this scenario, the lesion develops from myelin (outside) to the axon (inside) (Outside-In model) (Fig. 1a) . In this Outside-In model, myelin and/or oligodendrocytes can be damaged by: (1) direct virus infection; (2) cytotoxic T cells and macrophages; (3) toxic substances, including cytokines and proteases, produced by T cells, macrophages, and glial cells; and/or (4) autoantibodies against myelin and oligodendrocytes. Recently, gray matter involvement, occurring in normal-appearing gray matter (NAGM) [78] , and axonal injury present in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) have been demonstrated in MS [12, 43, 48] . This raises two questions. First, does axonal injury arise from destruction of myelin surrounding axons due to a bystander effect or from a direct insult to axons or neurons (primary axonopathy)? Second, regardless of the cause of axonal damage, is this simply an end product, or could this contribute to secondary damage or trigger demyelination?",

Although its precise etiology is unknown, MS is considered to synonymous with the pathological designation, AIDP [21] . In 1986, however, Feasby et al. [22] described an axonal form of GBS and challenged the existing notion of GBS being a primarily demyelinating disease [14] . In axonal GBS, axonal degeneration can be seen without demyelination or lymphocyte infiltration [29] . This is contrary to the traditional belief that axonal involvement in GBS occurs secondarily to or by a bystander fashion following severe demyelination. In axonal GBS, frequent associations with antecedent Campylobacter jejuni infections and with anti-ganglioside antibodies have been demonstrated. Molecular mimicry between C. jejuni and a neural epitope has been proposed as a mechanism for immunopathology. This is further supported by an animal model of axonal GBS that is induced by sensitization with GM1 ganglioside [103] . Although axonal degeneration is increasingly recognized in MS, it is regarded as only a secondary or bystander event.

A reduction in the ratio in the white matter has been attributed to axonal loss, atrophy, degeneration or metabolic dysfunction. Patients with MS have lower levels of NAA than normal controls. Partially reversible signal decrease is observed during the active inflammatory phase, which becomes irreversible during the chronic inactive state. The reversibility is interpreted as the result of the presence of edema, reactive astrocytes and inflammatory cells or as reversible axonal atrophy or metabolic dysfunction. The NAA/Cr signal decrease was also observed in NAWM in both patients with relapsing-remitting (RR)-MS and SP-MS, while SP-MS patients showed lower NAA/Cr ratios than those in RR-MS [24] .",

Although myelin pallor, multinucleated giant cells, and neuronal loss are well-established pathological findings in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalitis, axons have long been considered to be unaffected in HIV encephalitis until the terminal stages. By APP immunostaining, axonal damage was demonstrated not only in HIV encephalitis [28, 66] , but also in HIV-positive asymptomatic patients [5] . Raja et al. [66] demonstrated that the prevalence and abundance of APP-positive staining axons paralleled the severity or pallor of myelin staining in the cerebral white matter, where oligodendrocytes were neither reduced in number nor infected. Giometto et al. [28] showed that the appearance of the immunostaining varied from globular (or ballooned) structures to bundles of parallel rods [28] . The globular structures co-localized with areas of poor myelin staining in the deep white matter and were indicative of chronic lesions. The presence of bundles was predominantly in the peripheral regions of the white matter, including the gyri, and correlated with acute changes. The authors hypothesized that axonal changes could contribute to retrograde neuronal degeneration and loss, where neurons are not the target of HIV infection. Similarly, Adle-Biassette et al. [2] suggested neuronal apoptosis occurred via axonal retrograde degeneration in HIV infection, since there was a topographical correlation between neuronal apoptosis, microglial activation, and axonal damage.",

In long-standing lesions, both myelin and axons degenerated equally, while tissue appeared spongy due to the swelling of the myelin sheaths with a concomitant preservation of axons at the margin of the lesions. Although HAM/TSP requires differentiation from the spi-nal form of MS, severe symmetrical degeneration of the lateral funiculi accompanied by wallerian degeneration of long tracts is unique to HAM/TSP and not found in MS [34] . Using APP immunostaining, Umehara et al. [93] also found axonal damage not only in active inflammatory lesions, but also in inactive chronic lesions without any relationship to inflammation. APP-positive staining axons had intact myelin sheaths while myelin abnormality without axonal changes was rarely found.

HSV 2 can produce multifocal CNS demyelination in infected mice and gray matter lesions, if found, are relatively minor. If neuronal cell bodies are infected, virus subsequently appears in axons and virions are axonally transported. Using electron microscopy, Martin [46] observed virus particles in a very small portion of axons in demyelinating lesions, but not in surrounding zones of normal white matter. Axonal abnormalities were infrequent, relative to the dominant demyelinative pathology. Martin [46] proposed that neuronal infection and axonal transport of virus may lead to foci of oligodendrocyte infection with destruction and CNS demyelination close to or distant from the infected neuronal cell bodies (Fig. 2a) . Here, virus may spread cell-to-cell or extracellularly: (1) from an axon to multiple oligodendrocytes via the inner tongue process of the glial sheath; or (2) from the cell body of one oligodendrocyte to the next oligodendrocyte, which are apposed to one another in longitudinally oriented interfascicular rows. Thus, as previously suggested by Martin [46] , the relatively minor gray matter lesions in MS may be important in and not secondary to demyelination. As we will discuss later, axonal transport of virus ( Fig. 2b ) and oligodendrocyte infection ( Fig. 2c ) are seen in TMEV infection where a similar pathomechanism of lesion development is observed.",

Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) belongs to the genus Coronavirus, family Coronaviridae. Mice and rats infected with neurotropic strains of MHV (e.g., JHM and A59) develop demyelinating disease, and are used as experimental animal models for MS [31] . Using antibody against nonphosphorylated NF, Dandekar et al. [18] observed a modicum of axonal damage with extensive viral replication, but without demyelination, in MHV-infected RAG1 -/mice that are defective in recombinase activating gene 1 expression, and thus lack mature B or T cells. Adoptive transfer of spleen cells from immune MHV B6 mice into MHV-infected RAG mice resulted in demyelination with increased axonal damage. Macrophages or microglia were abundant in areas of demyelination and axonal damage, but viral antigen was present at lower levels than in mice not receiving transferred immune spleen cells. This suggests that both direct virus infection and MHV-specific immune responses contribute to axonal injury in MHV infection. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus TMEV is a non-enveloped, icosahedral, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, belonging to the genus Cardiovirus, family Picornaviridae. TMEV is a common cause of asymptomatic enteric infections in mouse colonies. TMEV is subdivided into two subgroups, GDVII and TO. The GDVII subgroup is neurovirulent and its representative strain is the GDVII virus. The TO subgroup is less virulent, and DA and BeAn viruses are its representative strains. Serological evidence indicates that Mus musculus (family Muridae, subfamily Murinae) is the natural host of TMEV [42] , although anti-TMEV antibodies have been detected in a different subfamily Microtinae, including meadow, water and bank voles [19] . 112 I.

On the other hand, intracerebral infection of mice with the TO subgroup causes a biphasic disease (Fig. 3a) . During the acute phase, 1 week after infection, TMEV predominantly infects neurons in the gray matter and causes acute polioencephalomyelitis mainly of the brain. Although infected mice recover from the acute disease, mice develop an inflammatory demyelinating disease in the white matter of the spinal cord 1 month after infection. During this chronic phase, the anterior and lateral columns, including the ventral nerve exit zone, are first involved, and the posterior column changes occur usually as a later event. Here the cuneatus fasciculus is demyelinated, but the gracile fasciculus and the corticospinal tract are relatively spared [92] . Although the reason for the predilection of the cuneatus fasciculus is unclear, this may reflect the observation that small-diameter fibers are relatively preserved compared to larger fibers in TMEV infection [50, 76] . Small diameter axons are present within the corticospinal tract and the center of the posterior column while larger diameter axons comprise the lateral part of the posterior column [56] . In the demyelinating lesion, TMEV has been reported to persist in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia/macrophages, but not neurons ( [61] , reviewed in [88] ).",

The mechanisms leading to TMEV-induced demyelinating disease are also believed to involve either virus-induced pathology or immunopathology in the CNS, both depending on viral persistence (Table 1 ). Since oligodendrocytes, the myelinforming cells, are infected with TMEV during the chronic phase [104] , direct lytic infection could result in demyelination. In contrast, virtually all types of immune responses have been proposed to play important roles in the pathogenesis of demyelination and in virus clearance. One possibility is that the demyelination is caused by a similar immune-mediated mechanism to experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), another animal model of MS, in which CD4 + Th1 cells mediate a delayed- [52] . TMEV-induced CD8 + T cells have been suggested to function as autoreactive cytotoxic cells or regulator cells [73, 85] . Antibody against TMEV cross-reacts with galactocerebroside, and passive transfer of anti-TMEV antibody can augment demyelination in EAE [100] . Intracerebral inoculation with a TMEV-infected macrophage cell line induces acute focal demyelination [89] and depletion of macrophage ameliorates TMEV-induced demyelination [61, 71] .",

Accumulating evidence has suggested that apoptosis may serve the innate host defense mechanism against intracellular pathogens, thereby curtailing their further spread to surrounding tissues. On the other hand, because of the post-mitotic nature of neurons, apoptotic neuronal death would result in permanent loss of cerebral functions, precipitating disease. In addition, apoptosis of the oligodendrocyte can lead to demyelination. Oligodendroglial apoptosis has been demonstrated in several demyelinating diseases, including MS [44, 57, 96] , EAE, [62, 87] and the twitcher mouse, a murine model of globoid cell leukodystrophy [83] . During the acute stage of both DA (TO subgroup) and GDVII virus infection, both infected and uninfected neurons have been demonstrated to die by apoptosis, using terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) [91] . The number of apoptotic neurons is much greater in GDVII virus-infected mice than in DA virus infection. Although elimination of virus-infected host cells by apoptosis prior to the assembly of infectious virus could inhibit viral replication, the absence of an inflammatory reaction [4] , another feature of apoptosis, may favor viral spread in GDVII virus infection, leading to fatal encephalomyelitis. During the chronic phase of DA virus infection, TUNEL-positive nuclei were co-labeled with oligodendrocyte and macrophage/microglia markers, but not with viral antigen or the astrocyte marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) [74, 91] , while TUNEL-positive cells were co-labeled with GFAP in BeAn virus (TO subgroup) infection [60] . Interestingly, oligodendrocyte apoptosis is detected in the white matter as early as 1 week after infection either in GDVII or DA virus infection (Fig. 3d) . In vitro TMEV infection results in apoptosis of neurons in explant cultures of the murine cerebellum [6] , neuroblastoma cell line [91] , macrophage cell lines [27, 35] , and microglia [104] , but not of astrocytes [104] .",

Although the mechanism of the transition is unknown, one hypothesis is that the virus first spreads from the neuronal cell body of the gray matter to axons in the white matter by axonal transport, and then infects neighboring cells, such as oligodendrocytes and microglia. TMEV has been demonstrated to use axonal transport in vivo. Viral antigens have been detected in axons, dendrites and the neuronal cell body by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2b ). Wada and Fujinami [97] showed that the limbic system is important for the spread of TMEV in the brain. Using footpad inoculation of mice with the GDVII virus, Martinat et al. [47] showed that GDVII virus infection in the spinal cord was prevented by sectioning the sciatic nerve, and was delayed by treatment with colchicine, which inhibits fast axonal transport. Since viral RNA was first detected in the spinal cord 2 days after footpad inoculation, the authors estimated the rate of transport in the sciatic nerve at approximately 20 mm/day, which is consistent with fast axonal transport.",

            "text": "Although an early ultrastructural study by Dal Canto and Lipton [17] demonstrated primary demyelination, myelin destruction with intact axons, in SJL/J mice infected with DA virus, they also reported a few dystrophic axons occasionally detected on days 100 and 214 post infection. In this study, it was not shown whether axonal injury was accompanied by mononuclear cell (MNC) infiltration or demyelination. Recently, axonal damage during the late chronic phase of TMEV infection has been studied by Moses Rodriguez's group in SJL/J mice infected for 6-9 months with DA virus (reviewed in [95] ). Using plastic-embedded 1-\u00b5m sections, McGavern et al. [50, 51] demonstrated spinal cord atrophy in the anterior and lateral columns, but not in the posterior column. A significant reduction in spinal cord areas was observed at 195-220 days after infection, in which a 25% reduction in the anterior and lateral columns was detected, compared with the 12% area reduction seen at 45 and 92-100 days post infection. A significant decrease in medium to large myelinated axon fibers was also detected in normally myelinated areas on days 195-220. Neurological deficit correlated with demyelination, spinal cord atrophy, and axonal loss in the NAWM. Axonal loss was examined in regions with minimal pathology, because automated calculation of axonal area frequencies was not possible in regions with demyelination or other extensive pathology [51] . Since resistant C57BL/10 mice infected for 195 days showed no spinal cord atrophy compared with uninfected SJL/J mouse spinal cord, the authors suggested that the atrophy was the result of a chronic demyelinating disease, but not the result of neuronal infection during the acute phase, which is seen in both resistant and susceptible mice. Analyzing a single demyelinated spinal cord lesion ultrastructurally, the same group showed results similar to the previous studies [76] . They also found increased intra-axonal mitochondria, which can be an indicator of axonal injury, in normally myelinated, remyelinated, and demyelinated axons. In addition, Ure and Rodriguez [94] demonstrated that retrograde Fluoro-Gold labeling from T11/T12 of rubrospinal, reticulospinal/raphespinal and vestibulospinal neurons was reduced in mice 9 months, but not 1 month, after DA virus infection. They suggested that the majority of neurons in descending populations had lost their normal connectivity to T11/T12, which was either due to axon or neuron degeneration or to functional impairment of retrograde axonal transport. In this study, it is unknown whether DA virus infects these neurons during the acute phase. The precise mechanism of axonal damage during the late chronic phase of TMEV infection is not clear. Rivera-Quinones et al. [67] have suggested a role for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted CD8 + T cells in the development of axonal injury, since axons were relatively preserved in class I-deficient mice compared to susceptible SJL/J mice, signifying a role for immune-mediated pathology.",

Recently, however, we demonstrated that the axonal injury heralds demyelination in TMEV infection [90] . Using nonphosphorylated NF immunostaining, we found obvious axonal injury in the white matter of the spinal cord of DA virus-infected mice 2 weeks post infection, approximately 2 weeks earlier than the onset of demyelination. The number and distribution of damaged axons correlated with that of microglia/macrophages, but not that of viral antigen. During this subclinical phase, prior to the onset of clinical signs and demyelination, axonal injury was seen in regions where subsequent demyelination usually occurs such as the ventral root exit zone [87] . Similarly axonal damage was rarely seen in the posterior column where demyelination is not usually observed [92] . In GDVII virus infection, severe axonal damage was observed in NAWM within 1 week post infection (Fig. 3b,d) . The distribution of damaged axons in the white matter did not correlate with the presence of T cells or viral antigens, which was mainly present in the gray matter. This suggests that neither T cells nor direct virus attack on axons is necessary for the induction of axonal injury. Axonal damage was also detected without myelin damage in vitro in myelinated mouse cerebellar explant cultures infected with DA variant Ds [6] . We do not know whether the axonal damage in this early phase of TMEV infection is permanent or reversible; functional axonal damage would not necessarily be followed by fragmentation and degeneration. An et al. [5] found accumulation of APP in the CNS of HIV-positive individuals without AIDS. They suggested that this axonal damage might be reversible and the axonal flow re-established and the accumulation of APP could disappear. It appears that HIV dementia can partially be reversed and brain metabolic changes visible on MRS in AIDS patients disappear after retroviral treatment [28] .",

Along the fiber tracts undergoing wallerian degeneration, microglial activation and oligodendrocyte apoptosis can be detected even in the regions far remote from the transection site. Oligodendrocyte apoptosis can lead to demyelination of not only transected axons but also intact axons, since a single oligodendrocyte myelinates multiple axons. In the latter case, demyelinated axons can appear as typical 'primary' demyelination,' morphologically.

The cell death does not occur in optic nerves from C57BL/Wld mice, wallerian degeneration slow mutant mice (formerly known as C57BL/Ola) [65] , which show prolonged survival of the distal stumps of transected axons. This prevents the normal influx of monocytes into transected nerves in both the CNS and PNS. Purified neurons, but not neuron-conditioned culture medium, promote the survival of purified oligodendrocytes in vitro [65] . Therefore, the axonal signal that regulates oligodendrocyte survival is contact mediated.

Unexpectedly, the mice develop widespread axonal swellings and degeneration, associated with predominantly small-caliber nerve fibers. The authors hypothesized that glial ensheathment provides a necessary signal that induces the axonal dependency on glial support [30] .

However, oligodendrocyte damage can also result in degeneration in the most distal part as suggested by a dying-back process. In the demyelinating disease induced by Cuprizone, oligodendrocytes can undergo a dying-back process, with degeneration starting in the most distal part, the inner loop of the oligodendrocyte cell processes. This eventually progresses proximally to involve the perikaryon, with resulting demyelination (dying-back (oligodendro)gliopathy, [45] ). Rodriguez [68] demonstrated a similar ultrastructural disease picture during the early stages of DA virus infection (11, 28, 45 days after infection) prior to the degeneration of the myelin sheaths. Although ultrastructural abnormalities were seen in the inner oligodendroglial loops, viral antigen was expressed in both the inner and outer loops [69] . Using electron microscopy, Rodriguez et al. [72] found a widening of the inner myelin lamellae and degeneration of the inner glial loops in biopsy brain specimens from clinically definite MS patients. The presence of early degeneration in the inner myelin sheaths and in the glial loops of oligodendrocytes was noted in most biopsy specimens. Such changes were not described in biopsy cases of MS by others [82] .",

A similar observation was made in myelinassociated glycoprotein (MAG)-deficient mice [40] . In MS lesions, loss of immunoreactivity against MAG is seen in NAWM [33] . Since MAG is localized in periaxonal regions of the myelinated fiber, this finding also supports the hypothesis that the damage in the inner loops precedes that of myelin or oligodendrocytes. In contrast, Dal Canto and Lipton [17] suggested that demyelination in TMEV infection develops from the outside to inside, demonstrating vesicular disruption at not only the inner but also the outer border of myelin sheaths due to stripping of myelin by invading MNC, as seen in EAE [39] . In support of this, Dal Canto and Barbano [16] found preferential disappearance of myelin basic protein (MBP) compared to MAG. The disappearance of MAG never preceded that of MBP in demyelinating lesions. A uniform widening of the myelin lamellae beginning with the outer layer has been observed in some, but not all [86] , immune-mediated demyelinating diseases of the PNS and CNS, including paraproteinemic neuropathy [64] and EAE [39] , respectively. Therefore, in TMEV infection, there is an apparent paradox. Does lesion development progress from the inside to the outside, or from the outside to the inside?",

TMEV infects neurons in the gray matter of the brain and induces degeneration in their processes, the axons, in descending tracts that run mainly in the anterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord. Here, induction of axonal degeneration can be protective to the host, since this will prevent virus from spreading axonally. TMEV is transported axonally which may result in axonal damage. Axonal transport could also lead to direct cell-tocell infection at the inner loop of myelin that attaches to the axon. TMEV can further spread centripetally from a distally infected site to the oligodendrocyte body. Since a single oligodendrocyte myelinates multiple axons, TMEV will spread centrifugally, at 120 I.

            "text": "Inside-Out and Outside-In models in TMEV infection. The lesion first develops from the inside to the outside. TMEV infects neurons in the gray matter of the brain, and is transported axonally, leading to axonal injury in the white matter of the spinal cord. Virus further infects the inner loop of the myelin, and spreads centripetally to the oligodendrocyte cell body, from which it spreads centrifugally to multiple myelin sheaths, resulting in oligodendrocyte apoptosis and demyelination. Axonal injury disrupts cross-talk between the axon and the oligodendrocyte and induces microglia activation, contributing to oligodendrocyte apoptosis and demyelination. Activated microglia/macrophages phagocytose damaged and/or infected axons, myelin, and oligodendrocytes and present viral and neuroantigens. At this time point, the lesion develops from the outside to the inside. Autoimmune and anti-viral immune responses attack myelin specifically or in a bystander fashion, causing primary demyelination. Severe inflammatory reactions further damage axons secondarily, which results in wallerian degeneration in the distal part of the axonal transection sites. This secondary axonal injury triggers the second cascade reaction of demyelination, forming a vicious cycle this stage, from the oligodendrocyte cell body to its distal processes, then to myelin sheaths, and eventually to axons again. Fascicular oligodendrocytes are located close to each other, and this will also contribute to spread from one oligodendrocyte to the other. Infected oligodendrocytes and myelin will be phagocytosed by microglia/macrophages, resulting in demyelination and persistent infection in and/or viral antigen presentation by microglia/macrophages. On the other hand, axonal degeneration itself induces oligodendrocyte apoptosis either by activation of microglia or the loss of support from axons. In most areas of white matter in the lateral and anterior columns, ascending and descending fiber tracts are not discrete bundles but are intermixed or overlapped so that individual oligodendrocytes ensheath axons in both groups. If either the ascending or descending fiber tracts degenerate to the extent where an oligodendrocyte undergoes apoptosis from loss of trophic support, axons that survived the initial injury may undergo demyelination. Activated microglia will release toxic cytokines, such as TNF, and this too will enhance demyelination. At this time point, lesions can develop from the Outside-In (Table 1) , although the original lesion developed from the Inside-Out. Activated microglia/macrophages phagocytose degenerated oligodendrocytes, myelin and axons, whether they are infected with TMEV or not. Then, microglia can produce chemokines and up-regulate adhesion molecules in the CNS, leading to recruitment of T cells. T cells will recognize neuroantigens or viral antigens presented by the activated microglia/macrophages. This will lead to a delayed-type hypersensitivity response to virus or induction of anti-myelin autoimmunity via antigen spreading. CNS tissue damage could also result in the release of neuroantigens into the systemic circulation that would also contribute to further induction of autoimmune T cell and B cell responses. These autoimmune T cells and autoantibodies might attack myelin from the Outside-In. Therefore, the Inside-Out and Outside-In models are not mutually exclusive and may act in synergy.",

            "text": "In this review, we proposed a new model for the pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases, Inside-Out model, in which lesions develop from the inside to the outside; primary axonal injury triggers demyelination that leads to immunopathology. If virus is transported by the axons, this will lead to infection in neighboring cells, including oligodendrocytes and macrophages, contributing to lesion development. After initial destruction, virus antigen and neuroantigen will be released and presented by CNS antigen presenting cells, resulting in the induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity responses and autoimmunity. At this time point, the myelin is attacked from the outside, leading to secondary axonal injury (Outside-In model). Thus, the Inside-Out and Outside-In models can collaborate in a vicious cycle or initiate a cascade of events. Therapeutic strategies targeting each step, including axonal injury, inflammation and demyelination, in these models will be important to prevent disease progression, particularly in primary and secondary progressive MS, and their animal model, TMEV infection.",

Axonally transported virus infects multiple oligodendrocytes; this can result in one single infected axon with demyelination. This leads to spread of virus within interfascicular rows of oligodendrocytes by either cell-to-cell or extracellular infection. Since a single oligodendrocyte wraps multiple axons, this might result in multiple demyelinating myelin sheaths without axonal injury or infection, at least, before virus spreads further from oligodendrocyte to axons. b TMEV antigen (brown, diaminobenzidine) is detected in axons and cell bodies of neurons in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus during the acute stage of TMEV infection. c TMEV antigen (red, TRITC) is seen in the cell body of a single oligodendrocyte and its multiple processes and myelin sheaths (arrows), 3 weeks after DA virus infection. Virus antigen-positive myelin sheaths wrap axons immunostained with phosphorylated neurofilament (green, FITC) (TMEV; Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis virus). b \u00d7 200, c \u00d7 400",

During the subclinical stage, 2-4 weeks after infection, minimal or no lesion is detected in the spinal cord white matter by routine myelin or H&E staining (normal appearing white matter; NAWM). b-d During the acute phase of GDVII virus infection, the spinal cord white matter appears normal by routine myelin staining (b).
