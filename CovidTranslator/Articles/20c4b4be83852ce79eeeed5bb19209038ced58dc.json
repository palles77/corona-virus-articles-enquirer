The cantilever material change can be changed to a softer one like SU-8 (Seena et al. 2011; Nordstrom et al. 2008) and SiO 2 (Yang and Yin 2007; Zhou et al. 2009 ). In addition, sensitivity can also be improved by using the suitable type of dopant (Ansari and Cho 2014) . In previous works, the authors has shown that the sensitivity of piezoresistive microcantilevers used in surface stress studies depends weakly on its length (Ansari and Gangadhara 2014) and inversely to its thickness (Ansari and Cho 2014) . Hence, the present work focuses on determining the effect of increase in cantilever width on its surface stress sensitivity and on the combined effect of increase in width and the introduction of rectangular holes to induce high stress concentration regions in the designs.",

The geometric size of the proposed cantilever designs is shown in Fig. 1 . Models#1-3 represent the increase in cantilever width and the introduction of rectangular holes in the cantilevers. The change in hole length is varied as 25 \u00b5m for A models, 50 \u00b5m for B models and 75 \u00b5m for C models. The width of hole is kept a constant at 20 \u00b5m. The piezoresistor is 10 \u00b5m wide and 0.1 \u00b5m thick, and is located at a depth of 0.1 \u00b5m from the top cantilever surface. The piezoresistors are changed as n-type and p-type. Figure 2 shows the typical finite element model of the piezoresistive microcantilevers used in this study. The solid finite element models were meshed using 3-D coupled field 8-node scalar SOLID5 elements. Mesh convergence test was performed for a numbers of cases to confirm the validity of simulation results. On an average, more than 100,000 elements were used in each cantilever analysis. The cantilevers were subjected to three different loads simultaneously, i.e. a surface stress of 1 N/m which was applied to the top surface of the cantilevers, an ambient operating temperature of 25 \u00b0C with convective heat coefficient of air 200 W/m 2 \u00b0C and a bias voltage of magnitude 1 V. Surface stress was modelled as in-plane tensile force acting outward normal to the top three free edges of the cantilevers. The average longitudinal and transverse coefficients of piezoresistivity (\u00d710 \u221211 m 2 /N) are, respectively, \u221231 and \u221218 for n-type, and +72 and \u221266 for p-type (Tufte and Stelzer 1963) . The mechanical properties are listed below in Table 1 . 4 Results and discussion Figure 3 presents the numerical results for maximum cantilever tip deflection, fundamental resonance frequency and the maximum von Mises stress induced in the cantilever designs when subjected to 1 N/m of surface stress on their top surfaces. The deflections increase with increase in length of the rectangular holes as well as the cantilever width. The increase can be attributed to the decrease in their bending stiffness due to the presence of holes at the fixed end. The increase in hole length is, however, much more effective in increasing the deflection. The frequency results, however, show a pattern opposite to the deflection case. The frequencies decrease with increase in hole length as well as cantilever width. Interestingly, the frequency results for the base models, i.e. A0, B0 and C0, are almost same. This suggests the increase in cantilever width has negligible effect on the frequency. This observation can also be observed in the other cantilever models to a lesser extent. This behaviour can be explained by the fact the increase in cantilever width is increasing linearly both the bending stiffness as well as the cantilever mass. However, since the frequency is directly proportional to the in square root ratio of cantilever stiffness and its mass, the width term in the two quantities cancels out. Therefore, the increase in cantilever width has negligible effect on its frequency. The high frequency of the base models can be attributed to their high bending stiffness because of no holes at the fixed end.",

The introduction of holes is clearly amplifying the amount of stress induced in the cantilevers. However, since the maximum stresses inside the cantilevers are well below their fracture strength of about 300 MPa (Sooriakumar et al. 1995) , the designs presented in this study are safe from fracture failure. In addition, since the typical values of surface stress encountered in analyte-receptor bonding reactions are less than 0.05 N/m, which is one-twentieth the value used here, the deflection and stress induced in the cantilevers would diminish accordingly. Figure 4 presents the comparison between the average stress values induced in the piezoresistor element along its longitudinal and transverse directions for the different cantilever designs when subjected to 1 N/m surface stress. The difference in the two stress values is also plotted. It is obvious in the figure that the introduction of the rectangular hole at the fixed end in the base models alone increases the longitudinal stress in models A1, B1 and C1 by about 1.74, 1.80 and 2.65 times their respective base model results. The transverse stress values in these cases, however, show a decrease in A1 and B1 but a slight increase in C1. The increase in hole length is clearly increasing the stress values in both direction. The rate of increase in longitudinal stress is, however, much higher than the transverse stress.",

Since the sensitivity of a piezoresistive microcantilever biosensor depends on the resistance change induced in the piezoresistor whose magnitude depends on the longitudinal and transverse stresses, the stress difference values are also plotted in Fig. 4 to show the effects of the presence of rectangular hole and the hole length as well as the cantilever width. It can be seen in the figure that the stress difference values are increasing with all the three modifications. Figure 5 shows the normalised surface stress sensitivity results for the n-type and p-type piezoresistive microcantilever biosensors under a surface stress of 1 N/m. The standard sensitivity of A0 model for n-type and p-type microcantilevers, which is used to normalise the other results, is about \u22120.132 and +0.102 %, respectively. The negative sign for n-type indicates that the total electrical resistance is decreasing which is because of its negative coefficients of piezoresistivity. Though the n-type basic microcantilever design A0 has a higher absolute sensitivity than corresponding p-type, the geometric modifications incorporated Comparison between normalised sensitivity results in n-type (left) and p-type (right) cantilever designs to improve further the sensitivity are less helpful in case of n-type, as shown in Fig. 5 .",

In addition, cantilevers with long rectangular holes can have a higher probability of non-zero initial deflections and stresses. Therefore, considering the microfabrication constraints we can conclude that p-type B2 microcantilever is the most suitable design for improving the sensitivity of the piezoresistive microcantilever for surface stress studies. This design is relatively easy to fabricate and is less susceptible to fabrication-induced residual stresses.",

The objective was to find the optimum design of the cantilever for such a study by varying the cantilever width, introducing rectangular hole and increasing the hole length, and by changing the type of piezoresistor. The designs were characterised for their tip deflection, resonant frequency, maximum stress and surface stress sensitivity. The surface stress sensitivity of each design was determined by determining the average longitudinal and transverse stress in their piezoresistor element. Results showed that the increase in the cantilever width has mixed results on sensitivity. The sensitivity decreased with increase in cantilever width for n-type designs, and first increased then decreased for p-type designs. The introduction of rectangular holes in the base deigns A0, B0 and C0 increased their sensitivity by about 50 % in n-type and 190 % for p-type designs. However, when the increase in width is combined with the increase in rectangular hole length, the sensitivity of the base deigns A0, B0 and C0 is improved by about 70, 90 and 130 % in n-type, and 190, 170 and 270 % in p-type, respectively. In addition, the increase in hole length was found to have less significant effect on increasing sensitivity and the maximum improvement is less than 23 % for n-type and 28 % for p-type cantilevers. We found that the maximum increase in sensitivity achieved by means of introducing the geometric modifications is about 80 % in n-type and 340 % for p-type designs. Considering the design requirements of high resonant frequency, high sensitivity and fabrication challenges, we can conclude that p-type B2 microcantilever is the most suitable deigns for surface stress studies.",
