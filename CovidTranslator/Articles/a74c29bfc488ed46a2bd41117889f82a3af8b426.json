This article examines ethical concerns surrounding the development of markets in a particular form of human genetic engineering in which heterozygotes are fitter than both homozygotes, a condition known as heterozygous advantage. To begin, we present a generalized model of the condition, illuminated by the application to sickle-cell anemia. Next, we propose a typology of related markets, some of which are currently functioning with available products and services, and others that are widely viewed as imminent. We suggest the manner in which perverse incentives may arise for firms that market genetic intervention in circumstances where heterozygous advantage is possible. Finally, we propose that this misalignment of incentives with social welfare has arisen from both ill-conceived market intervention where markets are capable of achieving efficient outcomes and the lack of market intervention where markets have failed. We offer specific legal and regulatory approaches for reform.",

His talk, ''Eugenics: Its Definition, Scope, and Aims,'' while somewhat more inclusive than his previous work as to the classes of individuals whose excellence was to be reproduced for the future benefit of society, gave birth to the modern social philosophy of eugenics (Gillham, 2001) , which advocated the improvement of human genetic qualities by means of social intervention, and which gave rise to the Nazi policies of racial hygiene and mass extermination. These atrocities caused much of the scientific community to distance themselves from eugenics, but many nations, including the United States, Canada, and Sweden, continued active eugenics programs of involuntary sterilization, marriage laws, and immigration restrictions into the 1970s.",

Viewpoints range from those that celebrate the promise of biological enhancement (Naam, 2005) and those that embrace unregulated biotechnology as part of a libertarian political agenda (Bailey, 2005) to those that are more cautious about the dangers that may be coincident with the potential benefits of such technology (Garreau, 2005) and those that suggest that biotechnology can be socially destabilizing and warn that legal and regulatory steps will be necessary to reign in this risk (Mehlman, 2003) . Some go as far as to argue that we have a moral obligation to employ eugenic means to improve quality of life and to prevent needless suffering for all future generations (Buchanan et al., 2000; Glad, 2005; Rosen, 2003; Savulescu, 2001 Savulescu, , 2005 . Indeed, Galton set the stage for these arguments immediately following his famous statement about the comparative advantage of man over nature (cited above) with the assertion of just such an imperative: ''As it lies within his power, so it becomes his duty to work in that direction.''

The very advantages engineered by the interventions considered give rise to increased risks for the descendants of those who benefit. At the same time, decisions related to research and associated market development may offer differential advantage to those with economic and political power while insuring markets in perpetuity for those biotechnology firms making these decisions. 1 This article examines novel ethical concerns surrounding the development of markets in a particular form of human genetic engineering in which heterozygotes, individuals that carry a different version of a particular gene on each of two corresponding chromosomes, are fitter than both homozygotes, individuals that carry two identical copies of a particular gene on the two corresponding chromosomes. This condition is known as heterozygous advantage. We begin with a generalized model of the condition, illuminated by the application to sickle-cell anemia and other diseases perpetuated by the condition. We outline markets in heterozygous advantage for technologies that now exist as well as for technologies that are widely viewed as imminent. Next, we consider a number of ethical concerns presented by the combination of heterozygous advantage and the possibility of biotechnological intervention. We suggest the manner in which perverse incentives may arise for firms that market genetic intervention in circumstances where heterozygous advantage is possible. Finally, we discuss the market imperfections that are the sources of these ethical dilemmas and offer a few modest proposals to address these shortcomings. 2",

Many human genetic characteristics depend on whether a particular gene, an allele, in a given location on a chromosome, a locus, is identical to or different from the allele on the corresponding locus of the paired chromosome. Where the genes are identical, the individual is homozygous with respect to this gene; where they are different, the individual is heterozygous with respect to this gene. 3 The consequences of these pairings, or genotypes, can be dire, as in the case where an individual is homozygous with respect to the sickle-cell hemoglobin allele and as a result suffers from the lethal condition of sickle-cell anemia.",

Why has sickle-cell anemia not disappeared? There is substantial evidence that heterozygous individuals, those with one normal allele and one sickle-cell allele, have substantial advantage over the homozygous normal individual in resistance to malarial infection. A single sickle-cell allele is benign to the individual, but when the malarial pathogen attacks red blood cells, the sickle-cell allele shuts down the infection, making it possible for the immune system to destroy the pathogens, and offering the individual a high level of immunity to malaria. Individuals homozygous in the sickle-cell allele suffer from sickle-cell anemia and individuals homozygous in the normal allele are more at risk to infection from malaria. As a result, heterozygotes enjoy a distinct fitness advantage and are thus relatively more prevalent in the population (Fisher, 1922 (Fisher, , 1930 Haldane, 1926; Wright, 1931) . While at first glance, this may seem like good news, the mating of two heterozygous individuals results in a 25% chance of a child 86",

Provided that there is at least some prevalence of the sickle-cell gene in this group; however, one could envision that these consumers would be willing to pay for genetic testing to determine if they have a natural resistance, particularly if testing is economical compared to other intervention options. If less expensive pharmaceutical interventions could be developed with reduced side effects, there would be especially robust demand for these intervention types. It is certainly possible that visitors might be willing to alter their somatic cells, e.g., by methods similar to the blood doping used by some athletes to increase performance, but such a degree of risk and the associated discomfort for the purposes of short-term visits may render these markets unrealistic. Similarly, a stem-cell intervention would likely be too drastic to appropriately meet these particular needs. Finally, germ line interventions would offer no impact on the visitor, but only on the visitor\u00d5s offspring, and so would not be relevant. In sum, we would expect visitors to demand testing and possibly pharmaceutical interventions, but likely nothing more.",

We expect that both would be interested in being genetically tested, but otherwise, their interests do not coincide. Unless there is a daunting cost differential, sickle-cell homozygotes would be interested in somatic genetic therapies only if stem-cell interventions are not available, since the latter would require only a single intervention compared to interminable treatment. However, assuming that testing results are used to screen potential mates, or assuming that they were confident in the odds of mating with a normal homozygote, they may very well prefer the stem-cell level of intervention to germ line intervention, as sickle-cell homozygotes mating with normal homozygotes will produce 100% heterozygotes, with that genotype\u00d5s inherent advantage. It is unlikely that pharmaceutical interventions would offer any advantage, since sickle-cell homozygotes would already have relative immunity towards malaria, and treating sickle-cell anemia requires altering the red blood cells themselves. Normal homozygotes, on the other hand, would have interests identical to the expatriates, although they would on average tend to have fewer resources (Gallup and Sachs, 2001) .",

For the sake of discussion, imagine a homozygous individual who is able, through ongoing somatic treatments or stem-cell modification, to alter her genetic blueprint before falling victim to sickle-cell anemia, in the homozygous sickle-cell case, or malaria, in the homozygous normal case. Further imagine that this individual is able to alter her germ line so that these heterozygous genes are passed along to future generations. Finally, suppose that this individual is able to identify a heterozygous mate, either due to widespread use of intervention in the population, or to testing. This individual and her mate enjoy freedom from sickle-cell disease and immunity to malaria due to these interventions. But as pointed out above, not all of their children will be so fortunate. Offspring will have a 50% chance of enjoying the same heterozygous condition, but will face a 25% chance of being born homozygous normal and susceptible to malaria and a 25% chance of being born homozygous in the sickle-cell gene with the associated dire consequences. This issue is made even more complicated when parents decide in favor of testing and pre-implantation interventions that will not only affect their children, but in fact their grandchildren and all other descendants to some extent. While it may seem evident that these offspring would prefer these risky births to not being born at all (should their parents die before reproduction), this determination is a highly personal one that requires individual utilities and risk preferences. The point remains, however, that the choice of interventions offering heterozygous advantage in the current generation is a choice that favors risks for sickle-cell anemia and malaria in future generations. In the very best case, these descendants are placed in the position of requiring these interventions themselves and the biotechnology firms are insured markets in perpetuity.",

The demand from the visitors and the expatriates contributes to profitable markets and as such they are supplied. Those demanded by local populations are needed to sustain life, but without resources, they are left wanting. Similar to circumstances posed by HIV/ AIDS, first-world patients demand palliatives that enable them to live with the disease. Third-world patients need a vaccine to defeat the plague once and for all. But since most of the financial resources (and the biotechnology companies themselves for that matter) are in the first-world and most of the victims reside in the third-world, most resources will be directed to intervention technology and far too little money will be invested in vaccines.",

Without malaria, the heterozygous advantage would be gone, the homozygote normal individuals would enjoy substantial advantage and homozygous sickle-cell individuals would quickly disappear. To be perfectly clear, this is not an accusation that particular firms in fact engage in these abhorrent, unethical practices, but is merely intended to point out that these financial incentives exist, and to remind us all that these companies have a responsibility not only to their consumers, but also to their shareholders that rely on the profitable deployment of resources. 7 Having established that markets for genetic intervention give rise to some unique ethical concerns where heterozygous advantage is possible, we now turn to the practical consideration of how these matters might be addressed.",

Strict application of Rawls\u00d5 strongly egalitarian concept, from behind his ''veil of ignorance,'' would surely provide a rational distributional insurance policy to protect against the possibility that any one of us might find ourselves in the shoes of those fighting malaria without any significant market power. Assuming that anything close to equality is applied in the valuation of human life, it is hard to imagine that even more traditional utilitarian standards could fail to achieve a more palatable level of distributional justice. Our purpose, however, is not to weigh in on what standards might be used to judge the relative utility of distributional options. These particular normative questions are for another day. Instead, we offer three modest proposals that would aid decision making, using whatever standard, by increasing available information, by shifting demand, and by reducing international barriers to trade, so as to stimulate appropriate production and promote the matching of supply to demand.

            "text": "Much of this work was completed while G. T. Jones was a Visiting Research Scholar at the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods in Bonn, Germany during the Fall of 2005. Their kind hospitality is gratefully acknowledged. The authors are grateful to Chris MacDonald and to four anonymous reviewers for many helpful comments and suggestions.Notes 1 Concerns such as differential advantage may raise the specter of genetic discrimination, in which genomic information is used to selectively offer goods and services. While we do not doubt that this risk exists, we do not treat this concern in this paper. Instead, we address the markets that arise from differential demand based on genetic frequency. Readers interested in pursuing the important topic of genetic discrimination further should see, for example, Billings et al. (1992, pp. 476-482) .2 For more general, but thorough, treatments of the relationships between business, biotechnology, and ethics, see Dhanda (2002) , Eaton (2004) , Finegold (2005) and O\u00d5Mahony (1999) . 3 We recognize that heterozygous advantage is a more limited phenomenon than that represented by differential advantage derived from differing haplotypes. Haplotype, in this sense, ''refers to a combination of alleles at more than one locus.'' (Ridley, 1996) . Although haplotype complexity yields a greater potential for alternative treatments, the instance of ''one-gene-one-trait'' dealt with here is an initial analysis of demand driven by different gene frequencies. While limiting our models to those of heterozygous advantage simplifies the analysis greatly, the ethical questions remain general. We thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out. 4 The lineage of potentially immortal reproductive cells in an organism that are distinct from the somatic cells, those cell lines which eventually die with each body. 5 With the exception of pre-implantation intervention at the first cell stage. Such early modification would affect all cells in the enhanced individual, including those that become the germ line (Council for Responsible Genetics (http://www.gene-watch.org/ educational/germline_manipulationPP.pdf), 2005; Testart, 1995). 6 Recognizing that ''expatriates'' can mean anyone living in a foreign country, we use the term here to mean those native to populations without widespread sickle-cell genetic frequency living in a country with a high prevalence of malaria. 7 It has previously been pointed out that perverse incentives may result in a preference for perpetual treatment rather than cure development. For an excellent case study of how such incentives have operated in the case of tuberculosis, see Reichman (2001) . 8 Clearly, it would be important to strip this data of any individually identifying information to avoid opening the pandora\u00d5s box associated with violations of privacy and genetic discrimination. A thorough treatment of these privacy issues is far beyond the scope of this article. Interested readers will find the publications of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, particularly the report, \"Research Involving Human Biological Materials: Ethical Issues and Policy Guidance,\" and associated commissioned papers, an excellent place to start (National Bioethics Advisory Commission). 9 Indeed, as this article was being completed, the Gates Foundations committed more than $258 million for malaria research and development, with a large portion directed to vaccine development (Gates Foundation, 2005; National Review of Medicine, 2005) . 10 Clearly, poverty is a complex phenomenon, with many sources of causation. Here we merely suggest that subsidies are an important contributing factor. 11 There is some speculation that heterozygous advantage in nature is fairly uncommon due to the ease with which the chromosomes mutate to hold multiple copies of the same gene. If a second copy of a gene is added, so that each individual had both a normal and a sickle-cell allele, then every individual would have the advantages of both. There would be some difficulty in fine-tuning other genes to regulate the expression of the now doubled gene, but where natural selection drives evolution, gene regulation would follow fairly quickly once the gene in question was doubled. With human intervention, such tinkering with the genome may be impossible for the foreseeable future even if we were able to adjust individual nucleotides, simply because such minute regulation may involve an enormous number of genes with multiple, yet to be determined, effects (Ridley, 1996) .",
