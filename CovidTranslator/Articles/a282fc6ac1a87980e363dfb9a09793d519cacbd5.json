The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization estimates 1\u00b738 billion children are out of school or child care, without access to group activities, team sports, or playgrounds. Parents and caregivers are attempting to work remotely or unable to work, while caring for children, with no clarity on how long the situation will last. For many people, just keeping children busy and safe at home is a daunting prospect. For those living in low-income and crowded households, these challenges are exacerbated.",

Evidence shows that violence and vulnerability increase for children during periods of school closures associated with health emergencies. 1 Rates of reported child abuse rise during school closures. Parents and children are living with increased stress, media hype, and fear, all challenging our capacity for tolerance and long-term thinking. For many, the economic impact of the crisis increases parenting stress, abuse, and violence against children.",

Importantly, these parenting resources are based on robust evidence from randomised controlled trials in low-income and middle-income countries.
