During the acute phase and also for prolonged periods after convalescence, the virus is shed in ocular, nasal and oropharyngeal secretions (Bartholomew and Gillespie, 1968; Povey and Johnson, 1970; Povey et al., 1973; Wardley, 1976; Wardley and Povey, 1977a) . Persistence of virus in the tonsil has been demonstrated (Kahn and Gillespie, 1971; Povey et al., 1973; Povey and Hale, 1974; Wardley and Povey, 1977b; Dick et al., 1989) . Although the etiological role of FCV in feline enteric diseases has not been well documented, the virus has been occasionally associated with diarrheic cases (Spradbrow et al., 1970; Love and Baker, 1972; Povey and Hale, 1974; Wardley and Povey, 1977b) . During our survey of feline enteric viruses, five strains of FCV (E-FCV) were recovered from either normal or diarrheic stools. In the present communication, some in vitro characteristics of these E-FCV strains are compared with those of FCV strains of respiratory origin (R-FCV).",

Because the virus is continuously shed into oropharyngeal secretions for prolonged periods, it is expected that the virus can be recovered from feces independently of the clinical condition (Povey and Hale, 1974) . Although FCV strains of respiratory origin were judged to be sensitive to the actions of acid, protease and bile in the present study, part of the virus strain was still infective after the treatments. Thus virus is carried out through the alimentary tract avoiding inactivation, and are transmitted via the fecal-oronasal route among cats. After several repetitions of this transmission mode, the strain may constitute virions which are stable under adverse conditions as shown experimentally using DOC in vitro (Table 3 ). All FCV strains isolated from the feces were resistant to the action of bile salt and one of them was also found to be resistant to the action of trypsin. Such strains, e.g. FC61, may infect epithelial cells of not only respiratory but also alimentary tracts, which results in respiratory as well as intestinal illness. Further probable examples found in the literature are as follows: the CFI strain which was isolated from nasopharyngeal area, but was resistant to the action of bile salt, and was recovered from feces of experimentally infected kittens (Bartholomew and Gillespie, 1968) ; and the M8 (Wardley and Povey, 1977a) and BF-71 (Povey and Hale, 1974) strains which caused clinical signs of both the upper respiratory illness and diarrhea in the experimentally infected cats, though it is unknown whether they are sensitive to the actions of bile salt or trypsin.",

            "text": "Another possibility is that FCV strains exist possessing affinities and pathogenicity to the alimentary tract of cats in nature (B/irki, 1966) . In recent years, reports concerning the linkage of calicivirus and enteric diseases have been appeared for viruses from humans (McSwiggan et al., 1978; Chiba et al., 1979; Cubitt et al., 1979 Cubitt et al., , 1981 , dogs (Evermann et al., 1985; Schaffer et al., 1985) , swine (Saif et al., 1980) , and cattle (Woode and Bridger, 1978; Bridger et al., 1984) . Caliciviruses are intermediate between the rhinovirus and the enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae in their stability at low pH, as were FCV strains examined in the present study as described generally (Studdert, 1978 ) . However, it was shown that the FCVs of fecal origin were stable to bile salt. FCVs might be divided into two groups based in the difference in their susceptibility against the bile salt: that is, respiratory-type and enteric-type. Further investigations to ascertain the genetic background of this different DOC susceptibility among FCV strains may provide deeper understanding of the grouping and pathogenicities of FCVs as well as their relation to enteric caliciviruses of other animal species.",
