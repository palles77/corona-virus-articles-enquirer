Travellers from the region rapidly became the most common source of imported infections in the earliest stage of the Norwegian COVID-19 epidemic. The situation was exacerbated by the unfortunate temporal overlap between the Norwegian winter holidays and intense epidemic spread of COVID-19 in Northern Italy, resulting in a large number of infected travellers. Here we combined flight data on travels between Norway and Lombardy with patient-level data to determine the fraction of travellers returning to Norway that had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 .",

We find a clear increase in the fraction of infected travellers during the period, from~1% on Feb 21st-25th with an exponential increase to~9% on March 1st (Fig. 2) . Similarly, we calculate the incidence rate per person-day among Norwegians in Lombardy to be roughly 3.4e-3 on Feb 21st-25th, up to 0.02 per person-day on March 1st.",

The data included all commercial direct flights between any Lombardian airport (all of which were Milanese) and an Avinor airport in the period Feb 1st -Mar 10th. The data also included passengers leaving an Avinor airport towards Milano with an indirect (\"connecting\") flight, but not those arriving from Lombardy via other airports. The latter was inferred by assuming equal proportions of direct vs indirect travel on flights to and from Lombardy. Notably, the data didn't include information about non-Avinor-operated airports. This means that flights from Torp/Sandefjord airport are not included. A maximum of two flights per week were flying between Torp and Milano in the study period, and among patients that were diagnosed in Norway, none were reported to have been on this route. Travel by alternative means such as by car or train were assumed to be too uncommon to matter in our estimates.",
