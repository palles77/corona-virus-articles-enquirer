This new virus, initially emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, led to a sharply spreading outbreak of human respiratory disease (COVID-2019), both within People's Republic of China and in several other countries worldwide. On March 9 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Currently, Italy is the second most affected country by COVID-19 infection after China. The first autochthonous infection case was confirmed in Italy on February 21 2020 and up to now (March 12), 12462 cases with 827 deaths have been registered in Italy. Considering the recent evolution of Italian epidemiologic picture, many health-care facilities will be likely in charge of managing patients affected by in the next days. The \"L. Spallanzani\" National Institute for the Infectious Diseases, IRCCS has been the first Italian hospital to admit patients affected by COVID-19. Therefore, it will be useful to share the protocol for the clinical management of COVID-19 confirmed cases, applied within our Institute, in order to support other facilities that may have a limited experience in treating COVID-19 patients.",

Considering the burden of clinical symptoms and the higher risk for complications, the goals of clinical management are, in addition to the ones stated for the asymptomatic patients: 1) Closer monitoring of clinical conditions and analytical data 2) Strategy aimed at accelerating viral clearance, through use of potentially efficacious experimental antiviral drugs Characteristics: -Prostration, severe asthenia, high fever (>38\u02daC) and/or persistent cough, clinical or radiological signs of lung involvement -No clinical or laboratoristic parameters of clinical severity and/or respiratory impairment Additional microbiologic diagnostics: -Influenza virus detection and/or respiratory agents multiplex PCR on single rhinopharyngeal swab sample -SARS-CoV-2 serology if available -Urinary L. pneumophila and S. pneumoniae antigen detection -In case of availability of samples representative of lower respiratory tract (e.g. sputum), perform gram stain and culture; avoid aerosol-generating procedures to induce sputum, because of the higher infectious risk for healthcare workers -In case of fever (> 38\u02daC), perform at least 2 blood cultures, possibly before starting new antimicrobial therapies Clinical monitoring: -Periodic clinical re-evaluation (once/work shift; thrice/day) -Periodic vital signs recording (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2, GCS, body temperature) (once/work shift, thrice/day), in order to early identify a possible rapid worsening of respiratory functions requiring an increase of the level of care -Arterial blood gas analysis monitoring (mainly between 5 th and 7 th day or if clinical worsening), to be evaluated together with the intensive care specialist in charge Virologic monitoring: -SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR performed on rhinopharyngeal swab every 48-72 hours until persistently negative Imaging diagnostics: -Chest X-ray: useful as a first-line radiological examination, for the follow-up and for a rapid assessment of certain pulmonary/thoracic emergencies. Quick and easy to perform; in case of necessity, it can be performed using portable systems. -Chest computed tomography, without contrast: high sensitivity in identifying and quantifying lung parenchymal involvement.

Quick and easy to perform; in case of necessity, it can be performed using portable systems -Chest computed tomography, without contrast: high sensitivity in identifying and quantifying lung parenchymal involvement. To be performed in every patient affected by lung involvement causing respiratory failure. Use of contrast only in case of specific clinical questions (e.g. pulmonary embolism).

The safety profile of TCZ is well known. In the TQT study, the most common marked laboratory abnormality was low neutrophil counts. Decreases were observed in mean neutrophil counts following single doses of TCZ over the first 2 days post-treatment, reaching a maximum at approximately 24 hours after the infusion. The observed incidence of marked decreases in neutrophil counts increased with the higher dose of TCZ. Thrombocytopenia and increase of liver function tests have also been described.",
