            "text": "In tourism studies globalization and localization are often conceived of as a binary opposition. The ethnography of an Indonesian group of tour guides presented here illustrates how the global and the local are intimately intertwined through what has been described as the process of ''glocalization''. The guides studied are remarkable front-runners of glocalization. They fully participate in global popular culture and use new technologies in their private lives. While guiding, however, they skillfully represent the glocalized life around them as a distinctive ''local'', adapted to the tastes of different groups of international tourists. It is concluded that tourism offers excellent opportunities to study glocalization, but that more grounded research is needed.",

The World Travel and Tourism Council claims that tourism has become the world's largest industry. This lobby group points out that the industry generates more than 10% of global economic output and employment (WTTC 2003) . According to the World Tourism Organization, international arrivals passed the 700 million mark in 2002 . Although there was a decrease of 1.2% in 2003, it predicts that arrival volume will reach 1.56 billion by the year 2020, pushing annual revenues to US$1.550 billion, nearly four times more than the current earnings (WTO 2001 (WTO , 2003 (WTO , 2004 . This kind of statistical data is often used by scholars as a pretext to validate their research. However, there is much more to tourism that makes its thorough study a justified enterprise. After all, it is more than an ensemble of economic practices solely driven by capitalist interests; it is a global, dynamic sociocultural phenomenon.",

Globalization is often described as a process by which events, decisions, and activities in one part of the world can come to have significant consequences for individuals and communities in quite distant parts of the globe (Giddens 1990 ). This situation of growing global interconnectedness and interdependency is opening up the cross-cultural production of local meanings, self-images, representations, and modes of life typical of various groups and individuals (Appadurai 1996) . In other words, the sociocultural impact of globalization first and foremost comes out of the transformation of localities themselves (Miller 1995; Wilson and Dissanayake 1996) . Paradoxically, the increased interest in global forces and flows has pushed notions of the local more than ever to the forefront of scholarly analyses. ''The local'' not only refers to a spatially limited locality; it is, above all, a space inhabited by people who have a particular sense of place, a specific way of life, and a certain ethos and worldview.",

A great deal of scholarly energy has been devoted to showing that the local is not and never was the passive, bounded, and homogeneous entity it is frequently assumed to be (Clifford 1997; Gupta and Ferguson 1997; Low and Lawrence-Z\u00fa \u00f1iga 2003) . However, ideas of cultures existing in some primordial and static form are often reiterated in the context of tourism. Through their discourse and narratives, local tour guides are key actors in the process of ''localizing''-folklorizing, ethnicizing, and exoticizing-a destination. They are often the only group at a destination with whom tourists interact for a considerable amount of time. They are entrusted with the public relations mission ''to encapsulate the essence of place'' (Pond 1993:vii) and to be a window onto a site, region, or even country. However, guiding is not just about giving people facts and figures about a destination. Scholars have long recognized this, and the role of guides in conveying information, offering explanations, and developing narratives has become a research theme in and of itself (Ap and Wong 2001; Cohen 1985 ; Dahles 2002; Holloway 1981 ; Pearce 1984) .",

One can also look at them as being small entrepreneurs who, not always successfully, sell their services to a varied group of tourists (Dahles and Bras 1999b) . Some guides are even engaged in the art of deception and may, for example, be focused on taking tourists to specific souvenir shops, in order to receive commissions. In other words, guides are not necessarily altruistic mediators by vocation, nor can they be expected to submit blindly to government rules and regulations exacting them to tell prefabricated stories (Bras 2000) . While some really take pride in representing and explaining their natural and cultural heritage, others are much more business-oriented and merely interested in selling images, knowledge, contacts, souvenirs, access, authenticity, ideology, and sometimes even themselves (through prostitution).",

Using the case study of a small but remarkable group of tour guides in Yogyakarta, Indonesia (a popular cultural heritage destination) this paper analyzes the ways in which globalization and localization are ultimately intertwined. This becomes particularly clear when using the theoretical lens of what has been described as ''glocalization'' (Robertson 1994 (Robertson , 1995 . Placing the daily practices of the guides under study within the broader sociocultural context in which they operate is instrumental to learning more about the pervasiveness of glocalization processes, inside as well as outside the tourism industry. The micro-analysis presented here thus also sheds light on the subject of the local-global nexus in general.",

The concept is modeled on the Japanese notion dochakuka (becoming autochthonous), derived from dochaku (aboriginal, living on one's own land). This originally referred to the agricultural principle of adapting farming techniques to local circumstances. In the 80s, the term was adopted by Japanese business people to express global localization or ''a global outlook adapted to local conditions'' (Tulloch 1991:134) . The concept soon spread worldwide. The American multinational Coca Cola, for example, promoted its own version of glocalization with the slogan ''We are not multinational, we are multilocal'' (Featherstone 1996:64) . Robertson (1994 Robertson ( , 1995 widely popularized the concept within the social sciences. He argues against the tendency to perceive globalization as involving only large-scale macrosociological processes, to the neglect of how they are localized. In other words, this process always takes place in some locality, while at the same time the local is (re)produced in discourses of globalization. The local contains much that is global, while the latter is increasingly penetrated and reshaped by many locals.",

Tourism offers many possibilities to study its process, especially where international tourists meet local manufacturers, retailers, and service providers in the production and sale of glocalized goods and services (Cawley, Gaffey and Gillmor 2002; Yamashita 2003) . Without using the theoretical framework of glocalization, geographers studying tourism have repeatedly stressed the importance of the global-local nexus. Chang, Milne, Fallon and Pohlmann, for example, argue that ''the global and the local should be enmeshed in any future theoretical frameworks that are developed to help understand the processes and outcomes of [urban heritage] tourism'' (1996:285) .

Many have difficulty interpreting glocalization because they are trapped in the false binary opposition between globalization and localization. Nuryanti (1996) , for example, points out that studies of cultural tourism are often characterized by a series of perceived contradictions between the power of tradition (the local), which implies stability or continuity, and tourism (a global force), which involves change. Wood was among the first to criticize researchers for using a ''billiard ball model '' (1980:565) of cultures as separate, uniform, and passive units being changed by tourism. Instead, he argues that the latter is often appropriated by people in their symbolic constructions of culture, tradition, and identity (Wood 1993) .",

This goes hand in hand with global marketing strategies which rely on the philosophy that ''diversity sells''. The marketing of cultural and heritage tourism, which promotes the experience of so-called ''authentic traditional cultures'', vividly illustrates this. Interestingly, it is precisely in the field of culture and heritage that global-local dynamics have been most researched (Teo and Li 2003:290) . Whereas in its original micromarketing meaning glocalization referred to tailoring global products to particular circumstances, in the case of tourism and guiding, it involves tailoring local (and localized) products (representations of heritage and culture) to changing global audiences (international tourists coming from various parts of the world and with different preferences). Just as global marketing companies have to deal with the specific rules and conditions of each country or region in which they operate (Svensson 2001) , successful guides skillfully adapt to the specific expectations of different groups. It is important to note that ''local'' tour guides are not necessarily natives of a destination (although they are often perceived as such by international tourists). They might, for example, be citizens from the country visited, but come from another region or belong to a different ethnic group (Hitchcock 2000:205) .",

The bars of Yogyakarta and Arusha became operational in 1995 and 2000, respectively. Of the whole network, only the guides working for these two bars have had a chance to meet one another in person (giving the researcher an exceptional opportunity to study more aspects of glocalization). They were invited by the European section of the network for a onemonth visit in the spring of 2002. During this period, they underwent an intense two-week experience as international tourists in Western Europe-a kind of role reversal exercise-and also participated in a two-week interactive course on guiding and intercultural communication. It should be noted that not many guides in Indonesia or Tanzania are offered this kind of opportunity, which makes the group studied very unique. An indepth comparison between the two groups lies outside the scope of this paper. Future research will entail long-term return visits to both sites and an ethnographic study of the Traveler's Bar administrative headquarters in Europe.",

When guiding a group of European tourists, for example, they will seldom tell them that they themselves have been in Europe or that they also speak the native tongue of the tourist (given it is not English).",

In their free time, the guides usually wear trendy clothes, each woman having a personal style and preference. While guiding, however, they are dressed in a rather neutral way (nothing extravagant).

The small-scale businesses visited during the tours receive a small financial reward from the guide after each visit (to compensate for the time lost while explaining and demonstrating their work). The fact that there is no fixed circuit allows NOEL SALAZAR the guides to create multiple tours by visiting different families and villages.

Young people do the tour on bicycle while older people are transported in an andong (a traditional Javanese horse cart).

Apart from the planned attractions and activities, people sometimes have special requests, for example to visit a village school.

Apparently, the feeling that one is actively participating in the lived life-albeit for a very short timemakes these tours exciting. It is important to note that, for tourists, the local usually refers to an often pre-imagined authentic, exotic, traditional (not to say primitive) way of life. In other words, the local is much more than just a different space or place. The guides facilitate the tourist's experiential process by themselves blending in with the village life that is displayed.

Among each other, tourists naturally speak their native tongue (if the group shares a common language) or English (if the group is mixed or has English as a native tongue). Groups normally contain not more than 15 people. Whenever possible, big groups are split up in smaller ones, each with a guide. If these groups meet during their tours, the Javanese guides communicate with each other in Indonesian (their second language). This allows people who use Indonesian phrasebooks and have learned some to interact with them, often in a playful way. With the villagers, however, the guides speak Javanese (which most of the tourists take 640 TOURISM AND GLOCALIZATION to be a version or dialect of Indonesian as well).

This constant interaction with the city enables the villagers to engage in their own process of glocalization, albeit at a different pace than in the city. In other words, the local is already glocal and this is far from being a recent phenomenon (Geertz 1963) . For example, many Javanese farmers nowadays use imported machinery to help them with the rice planting process. However, as argued before, tourists mainly want to experience the pre-imagined local. Therefore, the guides only show those rice fields were the planting still happens in the traditional way. The whole tour experience is professionally framed and manipulated by the guides. Even if they would like to, the guides cannot go much beyond a commoditized, reductionist, touristic representation of village life because that is not what the tourists came to hear or see. Village tourism around Jogja is not about how the local is currently being lived and internalized by villagers. Rather, it gives tourists exactly what they want: a ''mythologized'' (Barthes 1972) version of village life.",

Glocalization processes are certainly not limited to tourism. However, using the theoretical concept of glocalization proves to be very instructive in understanding the sociocultural dynamics of tourism. It helps one realize, for example, that this is taking place not so much through ironing out cultural and other differences as through allowing in and reinforcing these differences.

The anthropology of tourism presents scholars with a challenge to do just this. One cannot deny that tourism is a global source of income and employment, a globalized trade in services (Hampton 2003; Mowforth and Munt 2003) . However, tourism should be seen not only as an economic instrument, but also as a part and expression of increasingly glocalized cultures, often by commoditizing them.

Through their daily work, the guides actively help to (re)construct, folklorize, ethnicize, and exoticize the local, ''authentic'' distinctiveness and uniqueness of Jogja that is constantly being fragmented by outside influences (global popular culture and tourism being two obvious examples). By reformulating what counts as culture and heritage to include the everyday and that which has not yet been memorialized in guidebooks and official histories, another kind of Javanese experience is constructed and becomes available to the tourist.

In other words, not everything and everybody is always and everywhere glocal in Jogja. However, the whole sociocultural environment is undergoing some form of qualified glocalization or the other, and the guides are well-placed actors to play a key role in this process. A long-term return visit will allow the author to empirically better substantiate the theoretical framework laid out here (including identification of more markers of glocalization).

This multidimensional approach cuts against the grain of recent tendencies to map, unproblematically, the economic onto the global and the cultural onto the local. Important in a more holistic analysis is the attention given to details, situated practice, everyday knowledge, and cultural difference. Informed research pursuits will disentangle how and under whose authorship certain aspects of daily life are being glocalized, and how this process of glocalization-which differs from place to place-seriously influences culture as well as tourism. 642 TOURISM AND GLOCALIZATION",
