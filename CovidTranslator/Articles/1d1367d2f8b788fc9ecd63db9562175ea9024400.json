Methods: The participants were 289 university students ranging in age, income, and ethnic backgrounds. They were presented with scenarios describing avian flu outbreaks affecting their community. They reported their anticipated emotional responses (positive emotion, negative emotion) and behavioral responses (helping, avoidance, sacrifice, illegal behavior) as if the scenarios were actually occurring. They also were assessed on individual differences expected to predict their responses. Results: Participants were only modestly familiar with the avian flu and anticipated strong emotional and behavioral responses to an outbreak. Path analyses were conducted to test a model for predicting responses. The model showed that age, sex, income, spirituality, resilience, and neuroticism were related to responses. Spirituality, resilience, and income predicted better emotional responses, and neuroticism and female sex predicted worse emotional responses. Age, sex, income, and spirituality had direct effects on behavior. The emotional responses were directly related to each behavior and mediated the effects of individual differences. Conclusion: Emotional responses may be important in predicting behavior after an outbreak of avian flu, and personal characteristics may predict both emotional and behavioral responses.",

            "text": "During the past century, 3 influenza pandemics occurred (''Spanish flu,'' ''Asian flu,'' and ''Hong Kong flu''). Almost inevitably, another pandemic will occur in the near future. 1 The most likely candidate appears to be a variant of the avian H5N1 strain, which has already met 2 of 3 conditions for a pandemic: it is a virus to which humans have little or no immunity and it can jump between species. 2 The only remaining condition is that it can mutate to a form that is easily transmissible between humans. The human cost of an H5N1 pandemic could be much higher than that of past pandemics, because of the increased likelihood of rapid transmission through air travel and high lethality. To date, 63% of persons with confirmed avian H5N1 infection have died, and the number of deaths from an H5N1 pandemic could be as high as 50 million. 3, 4 Preparation for pandemics has focused on the critical issues of surveillance, vaccine development and distribution, and health care coordination and response, with much less attention given to the response of ordinary citizens. 5, 6 Although the response of public officials and health care professionals is certainly important, the response of citizens may have as great an affect on the overall impact of epidemics and other large-scale emergencies. 7, 8 Citizen responses can range from acts of altruism and sacrifice that benefit the greater good to acts of self-protection and illegal behavior that benefit the individual at the expense of the larger community. 6, 9 Understanding the response of ordinary citizens may be vital to developing a comprehensive and effective plan for controlling a pandemic.",

            "text": "There is a growing literature on the factors that may predict the emotional response to epidemics and largescale traumatic events. 10 Demographic characteristics, such age, sex, income, and ethnic minority status, may be important. Personal characteristics, such as neuroticism, may put people at greater risk for anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Neuroticism includes greater vulnerability to negative emotions, irrational ideas associated with distress, and difficulty controlling impulses and coping with stress. 11 Positive characteristics, such as optimism and resilience, may provide protection against emotional distress and may even foster positive outcomes. 12 Spirituality and religion also may promote better psychological functioning in the context of stress. 13 Social relationships also may be important. Social support may be a protective factor, and social strain may be a risk factor for emotional distress. 8 Although predictors of emotional responses have been identified, less is known about the factors that may predict behavior. This is unfortunate because, as was apparent after hurricane Katrina, the behavior of citizens may have a large, immediate, and direct impact on the greater public health. 9 Whereas little research has examined predictors of behavior directly, a logical place to start may be to examine the effects of predictors of emotional responses, because of the strong potential relationship between emotional and behavioral responses. Emotions have been characterized as ''action tendencies,'' and there is both theory and empirical evidence to suggest that emotional distress may be linked to important behaviors in traumatic situations. [14] [15] [16] The purpose of the present study was to explore the anticipated emotional and behavioral responses to an avian flu outbreak. Lau et al 5 studied the anticipated responses of Chinese adults in Hong Kong to an avian flu outbreak and found that most people anticipated emotional distress or changes in behavior. Our goal was to build on that work in several ways. First, we examined anticipated responses in a US sample farther removed from a potential outbreak and less primed by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. Second, we expanded the psychological responses to include positive and negative emotions and the behavioral responses to include helping, sacrificial, avoidant, and illegal behaviors. Third, we assessed potential protective and risk factors to develop a model that may be useful in predicting responses to an actual pandemic.",

The correct responses to the 3 true/ false questions were 71% for ''avian flu refers to a large group of different influenza viruses that primarily affect birds,'' 71% for ''H5N1 is a particularly virulent form of avian influenza for which there is no vaccine,'' and 28% for ''the H5N1 virus jumps easily to humans and spreads readily and sustainably among humans.'' After reading the WHO fact sheet, the participant was asked questions regarding expectations related to an avian flu outbreak. Although these questions were partially addressed in the WHO fact sheet, no definitive answers were given, leaving room for individual participants to respond differently. Our goal was to provide the most current information relevant to these questions and then see how the participants interpreted it. Table 1 displays the results. First, the participants were asked how likely they thought that bird-to-bird, bird-to-human, or human-to-human transmission of H5N1 was outside the United States, within the United States, and within New Mexico. For each type of transmission, there was a significant decrease in perceived likelihood when comparing transmission outside the United States to within the United States and transmission within the United States to within New Mexico. For each location, there was a significant decrease in perceived likelihood when comparing bird-to-bird with bird-to-human transmission and bird-to-human with human-to-human transmission. Figure 1 shows these changes. Second, the participants were asked questions about how severe he or she thought that a human-to-human outbreak in New Mexico would be, and whether the public health response would be adequate. Most of the participants indicated that it was at least ''likely'' that there would be a high fatality rate (72%), patients would suffer permanent physical damage (69%), and family members would contract the infection (64%). The majority also thought it would be at least ''likely'' that there would be inadequate vaccine supplies (86%), medicine and treatment (79%), and infection control measures in hospitals (74%).",

Table 2 displays the results of these analyses. For each scenario, there were 4 components, with the same items composing each component. These components were termed ''avoidance,'' ''helping,'' ''illegal,'' and ''sacrifice.'' We computed avoidance, helping, illegal, and sacrifice scores for scenario 1, scenario 2, and both scenarios combined using the items identified in the PCAs. We used the items rather than component scores so that our results could be compared with other studies using the same items.

This study also provided new information about the familiarity and expectations of a US sample regarding a potential avian flu outbreak. The results generally support the hypotheses that protective factors would predict positive emotions, risk factors would predict negative emotions, and emotions would predict behaviors. They partially support the hypothesis that the effects of risk and protective factors on behaviors would be mediated by emotion. There were also direct effects of protective factors on behavior. This US sample demonstrated only a modest familiarity with the avian flu; 72% thought that the H5N1 virus already capable of human-to-human transmission. Moreover, the expectation that transmission would be much less likely in the United States may reflect a lack of appreciation of the potential for long-distance transmission through birds or air travel. In addition, our participants expected that public health preparedness would be relatively poor were human-to-human transmission to occur in New Mexico. The proportions expecting inadequate vaccines (86%), medicines/treatments (79%), and infection control measures (74%) were greater than those reported in a recent study of Chinese citizens in Hong Kong (63%, 55%, and 43%, respectively). 5 The results regarding anticipated levels of various emotional and behavioral responses are important in several respects. First, the findings lend support to the notion that anticipated responses may be comparable to actual responses. The increased levels of emotional distress and the higher levels of helping behavior versus illegal behavior closely parallel findings for past events, including the SARS outbreak. 8, 9 Second, the increase in distress and behavioral responses from scenario 1 to scenario 2 suggests a dose-response relationship between pandemic severity and responses. Third, women anticipated greater emotional distress than men, paralleling findings for other stressors and suggesting women may be at greater risk for mental problem problems. Although wanting to obtain descriptive data on familiarity, expectations, and anticipated responses, we were most interested in gaining insight into the relationships among emotion, behavior, and potential risk and protective factors. We found that emotion was an important predictor of behavior and that positive and negative emotion had both overlapping and unique effects. Negative emotion had the strongest effects and was related to increased avoidance, sacrifice, and illegal behaviors. Positive emotion had weaker effects and was related to increased helping behavior and decreased illegal behavior. These results support the concept of emotions as ''action tendencies'' and theories about emotions affecting decision making and behavior. 15, 16 Although optimism and social support were related to responses in the correlation analyses, resilience, spirituality, and income were the only protective factors that predicted responses in the path analyses when other variables were controlled. Resilience was a strong predictor of positive emotion, paralleling the findings of other studies, and was indirectly related to increased helping behavior and decreased illegal behavior. 12 Spirituality was related directly to increased positive emotion and helping behavior and related indirectly to increased helping behavior and decreased illegal behavior. The effects of spirituality on helping behavior may be related to the emphasis on altruistic behavior in many religious and spiritual traditions. Finally, income had similar effects to spirituality, in that it also was related to increased positive emotion but to increased sacrifice behavior rather than helping behavior.",

First, the US public may need more education about the dangers of an avian pandemic and better health care preparedness to boost public confidence. Second, the dose-response relationship found between severity and emotional and behavioral responses should be considered when planning for the progression of a pandemic. Third, mental health planning should consider women and persons with higher neuroticism scores as being at greater risk for emotional problems. Fourth, plans for reducing emotional distress and increasing positive emotions may have important implications for behavior that may impact others as well as the mental health of individuals. Finally, citizen preparedness may benefit from a focus on fostering resilience (eg, teaching coping skills) and encouraging people to draw on spiritual resources that address concerns regarding a pandemic.",

Nonetheless, as noted earlier, our findings paralleled those of actual events and were in accordance with previous studies on risk and protective factors and theories of the impact of emotion on behavior. Although psychological research has shown that humans are limited in their ability to predict future emotions and behavior, 27, 28 there is also evidence that predictions regarding the direction of emotions (eg, more negative emotion, less positive emotion) and predictions regarding behavior are significantly related to actual behavior. 29, 30 Factors that reduce the accuracy of predictions include affective forecasting errors, temporally induced optimistic biases, self-serving projections, failure to imagine situational forces and constraints, and personality differences. 27, 31 Our goals are to compare responses to hypothetical scenarios with responses to actual events, to better characterize the differences between them, and to develop algorithms to adjust for these differences. 32 Another limitation was the young mean age of our study sample and the fact that all participants were college students. Nonetheless, the sample included a relatively broad range of age, a full range of incomes, and a large proportion of ethnic minority participants. In addition, we did not use an established measure to assess behavior; most of the items used were created for this study. We were not aware of any existing measures that would have been more relevant or appropriate, and we used PCA in an effort to create reliable behavior subscales.",
