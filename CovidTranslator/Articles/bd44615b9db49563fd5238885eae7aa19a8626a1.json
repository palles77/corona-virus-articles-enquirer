Until now, there still no report regarding the risk factors associated with mortality of critical SARS and protective effects of psychotherapy. Between March 7, 2003 and June 4, 2003 , 102 adults were admitted to SARS control hospitals of Shanxi Province with a diagnosis of critical SARS. A treatment protocol including a combination of antibiotics and systemic steroids was adopted from the beginning of the epidemic, in accordance with the guidelines of the National Department of Public Health of People's Republic of C h i n J <. Unfortunately, without a definitely reliable treatment regimen ( a t least in the initial phase), the mortality rate has been high.",

Age above 50 was associated with a higher rate of mortality. The results were consistent with other reports ~8'97. Some reasons may explain why the older patients tender to become critical cases and predispose to death: firstly, multi-or-gans function of aging patients is decreased, with limited cardiopuImonary compliance and reserve, less adopt ability to internal and external environment, easy to occur respiratory failure, cardiac failure and imbahmce of electrolytes; secondly, the immune response of the aging patients is decreased with less immature lymphocytes, less ability of macrophage to get rid of pathogens, and the de creased secretive ability of lymphocytes to produce special antibody with the increase of age; thirdly, aging patients usually suffer from comorbidities. In this study, 35 cases (34. ;:{ ~) suffered from im portant comorbidities, and the latter is an independent risk factor of SARS with the end point being death :<. Finally, aging patients tender to be delayed diagnosis and treatment due to atypical symptoms. Attention shouht be paid to aging critical SARS patients, especially to those patients having comorbidities. [.ymphopenia in the early stage, including the reduction of absolute lympho cyte count and the relative percentage of [ympho cyte of the whole white cell, especially the reduction of CD4\" , CD8 , and (.'l):{ ~ lymphocytes, indicates coronavirus may destroy lymphocytes in an acute process. Study by other authors had shown that CD3 ~ cells were significantly reduced in the early stage, reached the bottom during the critical stage and lasted to death ~'' The results of this study demonstrated that lymphopcnia was independently associated with mortality. For this rea son, in the treatment of critical SARS patients, steroids should be under control with indicathms, and prophylactic use of antibiotics may contribute to prevention of secondary infections.",

Because of the characteristics c~f SARS such as high infection, congregalhm, and ~he rapid pro gress to death of partial patients, many patients with SARS have severe phobia, such as insomnia, poor appetite, palpitation, and repeatedly consult to medical officer, etc. For these reasons, medical staffs should carefully explain the clinical and epidemical characteristics, as the optimistic emotion can increase the immune ability, thus to improve clinical outcomes. The current study demonstrates that psychotherapy in the early stage is associated with reduced mortality of critical SARS.",
