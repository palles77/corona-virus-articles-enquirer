However. the maxmal viral titre was ohtained 2 days later than was the case with the wild-type (wt) MHV 3 infection; the viral antigens remained localized within small foci and no invasion of the entire liver was observed. The hepatocytes infected with D85 showed strong steatosis similatto that induced by wt virus. but the other lesions induced by MHV 3 (closing of endothelial cell ftflestrae and hepatocytolysis) were not seen. An important feature noticed with the D85 mutant concerned the establishmant, in the surviving animals, of persistent infection: this phenomenon was demonstrated by the decrease of viral title 10 the liver. virai RNA detection, and the fact that viral antigens gradually decreased until the 3rd month post-infection.",

            "text": "Mouse hepatitis vtntses (MHV) are enveloped viruses containing a single-stranded positive RNA genome. The viral RNA encodes three structttral polypeptides: the phosphonucleoprotein N (@I kDa), the matrix glycoprotein M (21 kDa) and the glycoprotein of the perlomer S (180-90 kDa) responsible for attachment to receptors on permissive cells and for cell fusion. MHV produces a wide spect.um of diseases dependent on the particular viral strain as well as on host factors such es genetic background, age. route of infection and immune status (l-3). The MHV 3 strain causes acute hepatitis in most sensitive inbred mice including BALB/c mice (4). In this case. the infection of the Kupffer celk and endothelial cells is a prerequisite to the infection of the parenchymal cells in MHV 3 induced hepatitis (S-7). In vitro. all liver cells (Kupffer ce::~, endothelial cells (8) and hepatocytes (9)). are highly susceptible to MHV 3 which rapidly induces large syncvtia in them. In the csie of susceptible mice, infection by MHV 3 leads to the appearance ot procoagdant activity induced by monocytesimacrophages and contmlled by i lymphocytes resulting in ahnortnalities of microcirculation and the formation of sinusoidal micrnthrombi (10-13). We have recently isolated a panel of MHV 3 thermosensitive (is) ct!tants to Irudy tbc viral factors in valved in the hepatitir induced in sensitive BALBlc mice (14). This paper describes the pathogenicity of one mutant: D&5. The replication of this mutant is rsduced only at a temperature above 38 \"C. At 37 \"C, D85 is able to replicate in DBT cells. Biochemical studies showed that it was an RNA positive nx~tsnt. No difference was observed in the size of the viral intracellular RNA species or in the molecular weight 31 viral proteins.",

For a morphometric study we used the freeze-fracture technique (the best method to study membranes). after the 7th day p.i., the virus titrc was no longer detectable in the liver but the RNA could be detected 20 days p.i. and a very small number of hepalocytes with viral antigens could be observed after 1.5 months. The differences between non-infectlou particle production, viral RNA, and protein detection could be explained by various factors: (i) differences in the sensibility of the three detection le;hniques; (ii) blockage of translation, since viral mRNAs seemed to be intact; (iii) selective degradation of viral mRNAs by host enzymes, while allowing remaining mRNAs to continue coding for proteins; and (iv) inhibition of viral maturation, either due to genomic mutations or to modification of glycosylation of S and M pro- ",
