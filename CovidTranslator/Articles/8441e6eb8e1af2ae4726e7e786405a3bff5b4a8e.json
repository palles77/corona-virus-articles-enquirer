The aim of this study was to construct Sars-CoV membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and spike 2 (S2) gene eukaryotic expression plasmids, and identify their expression in vitro. Gene fragments encoding N protein, M protein and S2 protein of SARS-CoV were amplified by PCR using cDNA obtained from lung samples of SARS patients as template, and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector to form eukaryotic expression plasmids. SARS-CoV protein eukaryotic expression plasmids were transfected respectively into CHO cells. Immunohistochemistry was employed to detect the expression of the structural proteins of SARS-CoV in transfected cells. SARS-CoV protein eukaryotic expression plasmids were successfully constructed by identification with digestion of restriction enzymes and sequencing. M, N and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV were detected in the cytoplasm of transfected CHO cells. It was concluded that these recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmids were constructed successfully, and SARS-CoV encoding proteins could activate transcription and expression of hfgl2 gene.",

The high viral virulence resulting in a significant mortality rate of infected patients has created widespread scientific interest in understanding the mechanisms of pathogenicity of this virus. Molecular biological analyses of SARS-CoV identified 14 open reading frames (ORFs) [2] . The SARS-CoV genome encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) protein and nucleocapsid protein (N) [2] [3] [4] . These proteins play a role in viral replication and packaging, as well as the process of invasion, respectively [5, 6] . Studies have shown that these viral proteins can serve as not only a structural protein involved in the synthesis of the virus, but also a regulatory protein in the regulation of host gene expression [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

SARS-CoV can cause inflammation of lung tissue associated with edema, hemorrhage and necrosis, cellulose deposition, accompanied by a wide range of coagulation dysfunction. In preliminary studies we have confirmed fgl2 gene expression in murine SARS model [11] [12] [13] . Foreign scholars have also noticed that hfgl2 genes may be involved in the formation of immune-coagulation in SARS patients [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Whether the SARS-CoV protein coding genes contribute to hfgl2 activation thus promoting the occurrence and development of hemorrhagic necrosis, fibrin deposition and microcirculatory disturbance in lung tissues, is still unclear. In this study, we established the eukaryotic expression vectors of SARS-CoV encoding proteins S2, M and E, and co-tranfected them into CHO cells with the hfgl2 promoter luciferase-reporter gene to investigate the activation effect of SARS-CoV encoding proteins on hfgl2 gene.",

The series PCR products were respectively cloned into PCR2.1 cloning vector, and subcloned into pGL2-Basic plasmid at Hind III and XhoI sites to form four 5'-truncation of hfgl2 promoter luciferase-reporter constructs. The upstream primers used were 5'-CTT ATG TCT TTC CTG CCT TC-3' for hfgl2p(-998)LUC, 5'-GGC AAG AGA AGT TCA GGA C-3' for hfgl2p(-817)LUC, 5'-AAT ACA GGC TCC CCA ATG C-3' for hfgl2p(-467)LUC and 5' -GTG AAT CTT GTT GGC TGT G-3' for hfgl2p(-243)LUC.

Besides its nucleocapsid assembly during the viral life cycle, the N protein has also been reported to activate the activator protein 1 (AP1) signal transduction pathway and induce apoptosis in COS-1 cells in the absence of growth factors [24, 25] . Other results showed that the SARS-CoV N protein can significantly activate NF-\u03baB only in Vero E6 cells, which are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, but not in Vero or HeLa cells [7] . Yan et al [8] investigated the roles of SARS-CoV proteins in regulation of the proinflammatory factor, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). SARS-CoV N protein was demonstrated to regulate the COX-2 gene expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) demonstrated that SARS-CoV N protein bound directly to a NF-kappaB binding site and a CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) binding site. Protein mutation analysis revealed that a Lys-rich motif of N protein acted as a nuclear localization signal, and was essential for the activation of COX-2. Surjit et al [10] showed that a short serine-rich stretch, a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal and self association through a C-terminal 209 amino acid interaction domain characterize this protein. These studies suggested that SARS-CoV N protein could enter the nuclear and affect host genes. Our results confirmed that N protein of SARS-CoV activated the hfgl2 mRNA and protein expression, and mapping of hfgl2 promoter assay found the important regulation region, -817 to -417 (relative to transcription start site) in response to N protein. Further researches are undergoing in our laboratory to study the molecular interaction between virus proteins and the hfgl2 promoter.",

Data indicate that the induction of apoptosis by the 7a protein may be related to its ability to inhibit cellular translation and activate p38 MAPK [25] . SARS-CoV 3a and 7a proteins-induced apoptosis in mammalian cells was confirmed, and membrane protein was currently identified to accelerate the induction of apoptosis in insect cells [26] .",

Luciferase assay suggested the N protein can activate the transcription of hfgl2 gene. Mapping of the promoter of hfgl2 gene determined the important regulatory region in the promoter from -817 to -417 (relative to transcription start site) and some important putative cis-elements, such as HSTF, LEF-1, c-ETS-2 and so on.
