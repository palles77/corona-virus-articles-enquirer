            "text": "Although canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) is an important respiratory pathogen that is prevalent in many countries, only one complete genome sequence of CRCoV (South Korea strain K37) has been obtained to date. Genome-wide analyses and recombination have rarely been conducted, as small numbers of samples and limited genomic characterization have previously prevented further analyses. Herein, we report a unique CRCoV strain, denoted strain BJ232, derived from a CRCoV-positive dog with a mild respiratory infection. Phylogenetic analysis based on complete genome of all available coronaviruses consistently show that CRCoV BJ232 is most closely related to human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and BCoV, forming a separate clade that split off early from other Betacoronavirus 1. Based on the phylogenetic and SimPlot analysis we propose that CRCoV-K37 was derived from genetic recombination between CRCoV-BJ232 and BCoV. In detail, spike (S) gene of CRCoV-K37 clustered with CRCoV-BJ232. However orf1ab, membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) genes were more related to Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) than CRCoV-B232. Molecular epidemic analysis confirmed the prevalence of CRCoV-BJ232 lineage around the world for a long time. Recombinant events among Betacoronavirus 1 may have implications for CRCoV transmissibility. All these findings provide further information regarding the origin of CRCoV.",

CRCoV was first detected in 2003 by RT-PCR in the UK from dogs suffering from severe respiratory disease (Erles et al., 2003) . Later, the CRCoV-4182 strain was successfully isolated from a dog with respiratory signs and was cultured in the HRT-18 cell line .

Meanwhile, HCoV-OC43 may have emerged after viral transmission from cattle to people (Vijgen et al., 2005) . The high nucleotide identity between CRCoV and BCoV, HCoV-OC43 and HECoV indicated that the four viruses have a common ancestor (Erles and Brownlie, 2008) , and demonstrated the occurrence of repeated host-species shifts (Vijgen et al., 2006) . Although CRCoV strains are frequently circulating in farmed and pet dogs worldwide (Erles and Brownlie, 2005; Kaneshima et al., 2006; Priestnall et al., 2006; Priestnall et al., 2007; Yachi and Mochizuki, 2006) , causing respiratory disease, little is known about their genomic evolution and recombination.

The CRCoV-BJ232 genome isolated in China was found to have 30,868 nucleotides and showed a genomic organization that was highly similar to the Betacoronavirus 1species: 5\u2032-UTR(nt 1-143),ORF1ab (nt 144-21427), ORF2 (nt 21437-22273), HE gene (nt 22285-23559), S gene (nt 23574-27665),E gene (nt 28355-28609), M gene (nt 28624-29316), N gene (nt 29326-30672), and 3\u2032-UTR (nt 30673-30868).

Meanwhile, conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing were conducted to verify the complete genome sequence of CRCoV-BJ232 with 100% nucleotide identity. Thus far, there are only two CRCoV strains with full-length genomic information submitted to GenBank; the previously reported CRCoV-K37 and our current strain, CRCoV-BJ232.

Moreover, the latter four viruses clustered together with high branch bootstrap values (Fig. 1B) . To investigate the genetic relationships among the Betacoronavirus 1 species, we generated phylogenetic trees based on the sequences oforf1ab, S, M and N genes (Fig. 2 ). Phylogenetic analysis based on different genes consistently show that CRCoV BJ232 is most closely related to HCoV-OC43, forming a separate clade of CRCoV that split off early from other Betacoronavirus 1. However, CRCoV-K37 strain closely clustered with CRCoV-BJ232 strain in S gene, and was more related to BCoV strain Quebec (AF220295.1) in the region of orf1ab, M and N genes. The major genes of the CRCoV-BJ232 strain showed a consistent trend in the evolution, while the phylogenetic topology conflicted in the subregions of CRCoV strain K37, especially in the S and orf1ab genes. These findings are consistent with recombination, a phenomenon not uncommon in coronaviruses, implying that the CRCoV K37 strain may have arisen from genetic recombination.",

Genomic analyses showed that the S genes, which mediate coronavirus attachment, were highly similar in these strains. Because recombination may be a driving force for the formation of pathogenic viruses from less pathogenic virus (Forni et al., 2017) , recombinant may play an important role in the pathogenicity and transmissibility of CRCoV. Limitation of this study was that the isolation of CRCoV-BJ232 failed on cell culture. More CRCoV strains were needed to be isolated or rescued using reverse genetic technique to perform experimental inoculation of dogs.",
