It has been reported that many viruses depend on plasma membrane cholesterol for efficient infection. In this study, the role of the plasma membrane cholesterol in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection of MARC-145 cells was investigated. Pretreatment of MARC-145 cells with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD), a drug used to deplete cholesterol from cellular membrane, significantly reduced PRRSV infection in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was partially reversed by supplementing exogenous cholesterol following M\u03b2CD treatment, suggesting that the inhibition of PRRSV infection was specifically mediated by removal of cellular cholesterol. Further detailed studies showed that depletion of cellular membrane cholesterol significantly inhibited virus entry, especially virus attachment and release. These results indicate that the presence of cholesterol in the cellular membrane is a key component of PRRSV infection. porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), cholesterol, virus entry, release, membrane fusion Citation: Sun Y, Xiao S B, Wang D, et al.

PRRS virus (PRRSV), the etiology of PRRS, is a positive-strand RNA virus that belongs to the genus Arterivirus, family Arteriviridae, along with Lactate-dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, Equine arteritis virus (EAV) and Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) [4] . It has been demonstrated that PRRSV has a strong tropism for cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage in vivo, and for porcine al-veolar macrophages (PAM) and African green monkey kidney cells (MARC-145) in vitro [5\uf02d8] . Accumulating evidence has revealed that the replication of PRRSV in cultured cells partially depends on the composition of the host cellular plasma membrane [9, 10] . Cellular surface molecules, such as heparan sulfate and sialoadhesin, play an important role in PRRSV attachment and internalization [11\uf02d13] . Moreover, simian vimentin and CD151 were considered to play a role in PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells [14, 15] . However, some links within the detailed mechanism involved in PRRSV replication cycle remain poorly understood.",

For instance, infection by Semliki Forest virus, a species of the Alphavirus genus, requires both cholesterol and sphingolipids [16, 17] . Additionally, virus entry and assembly of certain retroviruses and filoviruses depend on cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains [18, 19] . Cholesterol is an abundant, key component of the eukaryotic cell membrane that forms liquid-ordered microenvironments in the plasma membrane due to its rigidity and hydrophobicity [20] . Previous studies demonstrated that plasma membrane cholesterol plays an important role in the entry and infection processes of many viruses, especially in some enveloped viruses [21] , including Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [22] , Poliovirus [23] , Murine coronavirus [24] , Vaccinia virus [25] , Herpes simplex virus [26] , Foot-and-mouth disease virus [27] , and Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [28] . Moreover, the plasma membrane cholesterol content also affects the release of Influenza A virus from the infected cell [29] . However, few reports on the potential relationship between cholesterol and the replication of viruses in the Arteriviridae exist, although it was recently reported that cholesterol is a determinant of Equine arteritis virus entry [30] .",

Furthermore, cholesterol replenishment partially restored intracellular viral genomes and there was only a 17% reduction after adding exogenous cholesterol. These results suggest that entry of PRRSV is dependent on the cellular membrane cholesterol. The entry phases of PRRSV infection can be divided into two stages: the first stage requires PRRSV attachment to cells, and the second stage occurs when PRRSV penetrates the cellular membrane. To determine whether M\u03b2CD reduces PRRSV attachment to MARC-145 cells, mocktreated, M\u03b2CD-treated or M\u03b2CD-cholesterol-treated MARC-145 cells were infected with PRRSV at 4\u00b0C for 1 h.

The present study showed that the inhibition of PRRSV infection in vitro occurred as host cell membrane cholesterol decreased due to M\u03b2CD treatment. This effect could be counteracted by the addition of exogenous cholesterol and demonstrated the importance of membrane cholesterol for PRRSV infection.",

First, cholesterol may affect virus entry by modifying the interaction of the virus particle with host cell membrane. Cholesterol level is important for maintaining biological membrane fluidity [36] , and its removal could reduce lateral diffusion within the membrane. This reduction in fluidity could probably influence entry of PRRSV within the membrane. Second, the lipid environment, including cholesterol level, is known to affect the charge properties of some ion channels [37] , and the ion channels formed on cellular membrane require the presence of cholesterol for effective cytoplasmic delivery of the viral genome during virus entry. Cholesterol and sphingolipids are components of lipid rafts, and lipid recognition by certain proteins of viruses might be imperative for virus entry [38] . Moreover, there are also other studies indicating that cholesterol removal resulted in an inhibition of cellular signaling pathways [39] .",

In the current study, we examined the effect of plasma membrane cholesterol on PRRSV attachment and penetration, the two stages of virus entry. We found that cholesterol mainly affects virus attachment, rather than penetration. It was reported that PRRSV enters porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) via receptor-mediated endocytic vesicles and the low pH-dependent endocytic pathway [11] . Thus, it is possible that the effect of plasma membrane cholesterol on PRRSV entry into MARC-145 cell is also due to its influence on the endocytosis process.",

This finding is consistent with reports showing that cholesterol depletion caused an enhancement of Influenza A virus particle release from infected cells and a decreased infectivity of virus particles [29] . In addition, the infectivity of Newcastle disease virus could be reduced by cholesterol depletion and possibly due to virus particles released from cholesterol-depleted cells having heterogeneous densities and structural abnormalities [40] . Teissier and Pecheur [38] had demonstrated that the molecular shape of lipids, including cholesterol and sphingolipid, could affect membrane curvature and further influence membrane defor-mation and fluidity. Thus, structural abnormalities of virus particles due to cholesterol depletion and the physical function of cholesterol in the plasma membrane may be responsible for the findings reported herein.",
