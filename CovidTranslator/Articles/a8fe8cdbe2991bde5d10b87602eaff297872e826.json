They have been recently realized as instrumental in myriad of pathophysiological conditions. They have been implicated in various pathological conditions. The degree of malignancy of various types of cancer cells has been found to be inversely associated with the expression of cystatins. Cystatins have been found to have various antimicrobial, antiviral and immunomodulatory properties. Keeping in view as their being prospective drug targets and anti-disease options this review explores the role of cytoplasmic and cell secreted cystatins in various human diseases.",

The action of these proteolytic enzymes is biologically controlled by proteinase inhibitors. Cystatins constitute a powerful regulatory system for endogenous cysteine proteinases which are often secreted or leaking from the lysosomes of dying or diseased cells. Cystatins are proteins that tightly bind and inhibit the harmful effect of cysteine proteinases (Ekiel et al. 1997) . These proteins are all related by structure and function to an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases which was first described in egg white and called as chicken egg white cystatins. Cystatins have been evolutionary related forming the ''Cystatin Superfamily''. The members of a protein superfamily were grouped into three families on the basis of their location, size and complexity of polypeptide chains (Barrett et al. (1986a, b) .",

They contain additional disulfide bonds and are also glycosylated. Cystatins have an important regulatory role in normal body processes involving cysteine proteinase activity. Because these cysteine proteinases exist in all living organisms and because they are involved in various biological and pathological processes the control of their protease function by cystatins is of cardinal importance. An increasing attention is being paid to the physiological significance of these natural inhibitors in pathological processes. The reason for this growing interest is that uncontrolled proteolysis can lead to irreversible damage and detrimentally affect human health by facilitating diseases. This review focuses on the possible role of cystatins, natural and specific inhibitors of cysteine proteinases in pathological processes.",

It has been found as part of a multi protein complex specific to the central nervous system (Giaimo et al. 2002) . The main pathology for this proteinase inhibitor is its role in monogenic epilepsy, a progressive mycolonus epilepsy of type 1 (EPM1), termed unverricht Lund borg disease. The disease was previously linked to human chromosome 21 q 22.3. The gene encoding of cystatin B was shown to be localized in this region and levels of messenger RNA encoded by this gene were found to be decreased in cells from affected individuals. Two mutations a 3 0 splice site mutation and a stop codon mutation, where identified in the gene encoding cystatin B in EPM1 patients but were not present in unaffected individuals. These results provide evidence that mutations in the gene encoding cystatin B are responsible for the primary defect in patients with EPM 1 (Len et al. 1996) . Cystatin C, a serum measure of renal function, has been reported as a strong predictor of risk of death and cardiovascular events in elderly people. Ni et al.

A human homologue was also identified using a PCR-based strategy. The protein coded by this gene was named cystatin like metastasis-associated protein (CMAP) and showed 22.1-28.1% homology to human family 2 cystatins. CMAP mRNA was selectively expressed in all murine liver metastatic tumors but not in any pulmonary metastatic tumors examined. Transfection of CMAP antisense DNA into highly metastatic liver cells greatly decreased their metastasis potential and CMAP expression indicating that CMAP is involved in liver metastatic ability after intravastion of malignant cells (Masashi et al. 1999 ).",

These protease are all located along the endocytic pathway of dendritic cell and involved in the controlled proteolysis associated with the degradation of antigen to antigenic peptides (Pluger et al. 2002) . Fig. 1 Secreted CyC determined by CyC-specific ELISA secreted CyC, was determined in culture media after 5 days of promonocyte U-937 cultivation, after 5 days of monocyte differentiation to immature DC, and for 5 days of DC maturation with TNF-a. Figure adopted from Tina et al. (2005) Besides these specific tasks, they are also necessary for the intracellular catabolism of other proteins in late endosomes and lysosomes (Turk et al. 2000) . To determine whether CyC can have an impact on Cat S, Cat L and Cat H is human DC, their content, intracellular localization and secretion have been defined and compared during the differentiation and maturation of DC in vitro. It was shown that in immature DC, CyC content was much higher than in monocytes and promonocyte U-937 cells. The low content of CyC monocytes and promonocyte U-937 cells was not the result of increased CyC secretion, which was quite low compared with that in immature DC. High CyC secretion in immature DC accords with their strong endocytic activity but was not observed for promonocyte U-937 cells (Tina et al. 2005) . or for monocytes (Repnik et al. 2003) .

Although much work needs to be done, these new findings may open doors to slow, halt or reverse disease progression and forestall their devasting symptoms. To realize the full diagnostic potential of cystatin more research needs to be performed on the interaction of all cystatin species found in the biological fluids, as well as the regulatory mechanisms that control their production.
