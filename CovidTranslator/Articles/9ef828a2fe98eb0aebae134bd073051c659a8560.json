Many experiments have been conducted to clarify possible sequence requirements of functional siRNAs. Of these, our work incorporates guidelines from three major studies (6-8) of selecting functional siRNAs. However, designing functional siRNAs that target viral sequences is problematic because of their extraordinarily high genetic diversity. For example, about 500 entries of near full-length sequences of HIV-1 group M, which is largely responsible for global pandemic, are stored in the sequence databases, but it proved impossible to select a common 21mer from among all of them. Moreover, RNAi-resistant viral mutants achieved through point mutation or deletion emerge rapidly when targeting viruses in cell culture. These problems suggest a strong need to select highly conserved target sites for designing antiviral siRNAs. Furthermore, the off-target silencing effects of siRNA are also a serious problem that could affect host gene expression (9) . Off-target silencing effects arise when an siRNA has sequence similarities with unrelated genes. In antiviral RNAi, it is desirable to minimize off-target effects against human genes.",

The fraction is still as small as 0.8% even if the threshold of the conservation is relaxed to 80%. On the other hand, siRNAs predicted to be functional by one or more guidelines (6) (7) (8) constituted 35.5% of the 4 417 157 siRNAs ( Figure 1B) . Taken together, siRNAs that are >80% conserved, and satisfy at least one guideline constitute only 0.2% of the siRNAs. In this condition, 20-30 siRNAs can be designed for each full-length sequence of HIV-1. These indicate that most of the randomly designed siRNAs are not suited for targeting HIV-1 efficiently. Figure 1C shows typical output from siVirus for designing anti-HIV siRNAs. A total of 182 sequences from HIV-1 subtypes B, C and CRF01_AE, which are the most prevalent HIV-1 genotypes circulating in Asia, were selected. The results were sorted by their degree of conservation, and filtered to display siRNAs that satisfy at least one efficacy guideline. The off-target search results against human genes are also shown.
