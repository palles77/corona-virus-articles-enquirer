            "text": "Objectives: To understand relationships between microbes in pathogenesis of acute otitis media during respiratory tract infections, we compared nasopharyngeal bacteria and respiratory viruses in symptomatic children with and without AOM. Methods: We enrolled children (6e35 months) with acute symptoms suggestive of AOM and analyzed their nasopharyngeal samples for bacteria by culture and for 15 respiratory viruses by PCR. Non-AOM group had no abnormal otoscopic signs or only middle ear effusion, while AOM group showed middle ear effusion and acute inflammatory signs in pneumatic otoscopy along with acute symptoms. Results: Of 505 children, the non-AOM group included 187 and the AOM group 318. One or more bacterial AOM pathogen (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis) was detected in 78% and 96% of the non-AOM and AOM group, respectively (P < .001). Colonization with S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, each alone, increased risk of AOM (odds ratio (OR) 2.92; 95% confidence interval (CI), .91e9.38, and 5.13; 1.36e19.50, respectively) and co-colonization with M. catarrhalis further increased risk (OR 4.36; 1.46e12.97, and 9.00; 2.05e39.49, respectively). Respiratory viruses were detected in 90% and 87% of the non-AOM and AOM group, respectively. RSV was significantly Journal of Infection (2013) 66, 247e254 associated with risk of AOM without colonization by bacterial AOM pathogens (OR 6.50; 1.21e34.85). Conclusions: Co-colonization by M. catarrhalis seems to increase risk of AOM and RSV may contribute to AOM pathogenesis even without nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization.",

Inclusion in the AOM group required a diagnosis of AOM, which was based on three overall criteria. First, middle-ear fluid had to be detected by means of pneumatic otoscopic examination that showed at least two of the following tympanic membrane findings: bulging position, decreased or absent mobility, abnormal color or opacity not due to scarring, or airefluid interfaces. Second, at least one of the following acute inflammatory signs in the tympanic membrane had to be present: distinct erythematous patches or streaks, or increased vascularity over full, bulging, or yellow tympanic membrane.

Chonmaitree et al. actually showed that age was more important risk factor for AOM than any of the viruses. 7 Most of the previous studies have had followup during which the development of AOM has been studied in relation to specific viral infection. Notably, our study approach was cross-sectional and children were examined because their parents sought medical care due to suspicion of AOM. In other words, our study approach was the one where physicians encounter symptomatic children with and without AOM in daily practice. Our observation raises a question if differences in host factors play stronger role than differences between viral infections in determining which children develop AOM during RTI. Previously, Casselbrant et al. have shown that genetics determines 73% of risk of otitis media in early childhood. 35 Nonetheless, our results also draw attention to RSV and suggest that RSV contributes to AOM pathogenesis even without nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization. Among children not colonized with bacterial AOM pathogens, the risk of AOM was over 6-fold higher when RSV was detected. In two previous studies, roughly half of AOM patients infected with RSV had negative bacterial culture of middle ear effusion. 8, 36 These observations, including ours, show that RSV has an important role in the pathogenesis of AOM.",
