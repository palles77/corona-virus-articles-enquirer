            "text": "Cathepsin B has been found being responsible for many human diseases. Inhibitors of cathepsin B, a ubiquitous lysosomal cysteine protease, have been developed as a promising treatment for human diseases resulting from malfunction and over-expression of this enzyme. Through a high throughput screening assay, a set of compounds were found able to inhibit the enzymatic activity of cathepsin B. The binding structures of these active compounds were modeled through docking simulation. Three-dimensional (3D) quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were constructed using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) based on the docked structures of the compounds. Strong correlations were obtained for both CoMFA and CoMSIA models with cross-validated correlation coefficients (q 2 ) of 0.605 and 0.605 and the regression correlation coefficients (r 2 ) of 0.999 and 0.997, respectively. The robustness of these models was further validated using leave-one-out (LOO) method and training-test set method. The activities of eight (8) randomly selected compounds were predicted using models built from training set of compounds with prediction errors of less than 1 unit for most compounds in CoMFA and CoMSIA models. Structural features for compounds with improved activity are suggested based on the analysis of the CoMFA and CoMSIA contour maps and the property map of the protein ligand binding site. These results may help to provide better understanding of the structure-activity relationship of cathepsin B inhibitors and to facilitate lead optimization and novel inhibitor design. The multi-conformation method to build 3D QSAR is very effective approach to obtain satisfactory models with high correlation with experimental results and high prediction power for unknown compounds. logIC 50 Non-validated Cross-validated Bootstrapping Activity residue activity residue activity residue 29 3243168 \u22125.067 \u22125.045 \u22120.022 \u22125.059 \u22120.008 \u22125.062 \u22120.005 30 3250046 \u22124.736 \u22124.743 0.007 \u22125.149 0.413 \u22124.740 0.004",

            "text": "Cathepsins, as lysosomal peptidases, are responsible for intracellular as well as extracelluar proteolysis in mammalian cells. Several cathepsins (such as cathepsin B, D, H, K, L, and S) have been found to be involved in the biological processes related to a variety of diseases and disorders. [1] [2] [3] [4] cathepsin B, a member of the papain superfamily, [3] is one of the ubiquitous lysosomal cysteine proteases. Researchers have found that over expression of this enzyme is related to several important human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorder, cardiovascular disease, cancer, inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Cathepsin B has also been shown to play an important role in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis by facilitating cell migration and dissolving the extracellular barriers. [13] [14] [15] Furthermore, it is an essential factor to viral entry and replication of several viruses, such as Ebola and SARS in human cells through its proteolysis functions. [16] [17] [18] Since cathepsin B has been shown to play an important role in various human diseases, this enzyme was selected as a therapeutic molecular target for drug development. A number of inhibitors have been developed for the disease treatment, [19] [20] [21] including several inhibitors that were effective against rheumatoid arthritis in animal models. [5-10, 12, 19-21] Biological studies have demonstrated that many cathepsin inhibitors bind to the enzyme irreversibly. [22, 23] The structural biology studies revealed that such inhibitors bind to the active site by forming a covalent bond with the catalytic thiol group (Cys30) of the enzyme. [22, 23] The reported irreversible cathepsin inhibitors include dipeptidyl nitriles, [23] vinyl sulfones, expoxysuccinates, acyloxymethyl ketones, fluoromethyl ketones, hydrazides, and bis-\u03b1-amidoketones. [24] However, some other inhibitors have been reported to form reversible covalent bond with the enzyme, such as \u03b1-ketoamides and aldehydes. [24] The experimental three dimensional structure shows that inhibitor dipeptidyl nitrile (DPN) binds at the active site, formed by amino acids Gln24, Cys27-Trp31, Gly69, Asp70, Asn73-Pro77, Ala174, Gly199-Ala201, and Glu245, close to the interface of the protein dimer. The inhibitor forms a covalent sulfur bond with protein amino acid Cys30. [22, 23] In addition to experimental studies, computational methods have been used to study the binding structures of active inhibitors with the protein with the purpose to characterize interaction features and to interpret inhibition mechanism of small molecules for several members of the cathepsin class [25] [26] [27] including cathepsin L [28, 29] and cathepsin S. [29] The authors also performed a computational study to establish the interaction and activity mode between these inhibitors and cathepsin B. [30, 31] .",

The 3D modeling process requires a predetermined conformation for each compound and an overall molecular alignment among the compounds. Several strategies for building compound alignments have been suggested and successfully applied to 3D QSAR research. Yet, the determination of \"active\" conformation still remains challenging. Therefore, docking simulation has been applied to determinate the \"active\" conformation and to perform compound alignment. However, multi-conformations were often obtained for a single compound, thus usually a conformation had to be picked based on simplified rules or assumptions. In the light of the emergence of the 4D QSAR concept, [32] an approach involving multi-conformations QSAR was developed and evaluated in the work for the construction of 3D QSAR model. This approach utilized multi-conformations for each small molecule in QSAR model construction and optimization with the purpose of eliminating manual conformation selection and obtaining best correlations.",

In the confirmatory biological screenings, compounds were reported as active if they have inhibitory activity against the catalytic functionality of the human liver cathepsin B in a multiple-dose response experiment by measuring the release of the fluorophore aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) from the hydrolysis of an AMC-labeled dipeptide. Detailed information for the assay protocol and materials is available on the PubChem website (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/assay.cgi?aid=820,523). These tested compounds were identified in a HTS assay for the inhibition activity of over 60,000 compounds against cathepsin B where a single dose of compound concentration was tested. Thirty seven (37) were identified as active compounds, 35 compounds were reported as inactive compounds, while 3 compounds were suggested as \"inconclusive\" in the results of assay 820. Meanwhile, the numbers of active, inactive, and \"inconclusive\" compounds reported in assay 523 are 10, 16, and 1, respectively. Six (6) active compounds were reported in both assays. So the number of unique compounds reported as active are 41. Through further examining these active compounds with different protocols, the experimental authors suggested than some of them could be artifacts. To eliminating the potential artifacts, the authors examined these active compounds using several independent bioassay tests (different biological experiments) that were affected by the similar causes of artifacts. The examination resulted in the elimination of five active compounds from our active compound list as they bear greater chance as being false positives. The final 36 active compounds were included in the work. To expend the activity range of the modeled compounds, 7 inactive compounds with the similar sizes and structures were added in the modeling. In training-test experiments, 8 compounds were randomly selected as test set of compounds while the rest 34 compounds were used as training set of compounds to build models.",

The dimer coordinates were extracted from the PDB file and used for the docking simulations. In the original crystal complex structure, the DPN ligand is covalently linked to the thiol group of amino acid Cys30 of cathepsin B. [23] Prior to the docking grid preparation, the S-C bond between Cys30 and DPN was first broken to separate the ligand from the protein, and the N-C group of the ligand was modified into linear nitrile, a prereaction format. A docking grid was then generated based on the protein dimer using GLIDE after DPN ligands were removed from the active sites. To validate the docking protocol, the DPN ligand was then docked back into the active site of the first protein of the dimer. As depicted in Figure 1 , the docked pose from the dominant cluster [40] superimposes very well with the original ligand except that the methyl-phenyl ring close to G198 rotated for 180 degrees, and as a result, the methyl group turns to the opposite direction. It seems that it is difficult for GLIDE to prioritize the original conformation, either due to lack of a structural element to distinguish the two, or because the experimental conformer does not provide enough binding elements to be recognized by the force field employed in GLIDE. Nevertheless, the overlap RMS deviations between the docked poses and the original pose are ~1.2\u00c5. If the 6 carbons of the methyl-phenyl ring are not distinguished, the RMS deviations will be as low as 0.4 \u00c5. In the docked structure, it is noticed that the nitrile group has potential to form hydrogen bond with H199 amino acid. The hydrogen bonding helps to stabilize the position of the nitrile group that C29 amino acid attacks to form covalent bond. The results show that the docking simulation protocol is able to reproduce the ligand binding structure as observed in the experimental crystal complex. The same docking protocol was applied to determine the \"bound\" conformations for the cathepsin B inhibitors, as well as, to align these compounds together according to the receptor features for the QSAR study.",

            "text": "It was noted that multiple docking poses were obtained for all these compounds especially for smaller compounds that can be docked into the binding pocket with different modes and only slight differences on docking score (Gscore). As shown in Figure 2A , two poses of compound 24(CID:326798) obtained from the docking simulation have different binding structures, where the whole molecule flip over with the triazole ring directs to opposite directions, but with the two different orientations, the molecule fits well into the binding site and align well with the experimental bound structure of DPN. b. Interestingly, with the respective binding modes reflected by the two docking poses, the triazole ring either had direct hydrogen bond/ionic interaction with amino acid E122 of the first protein or with amino acid S175 of the second protein. Since both binding modes have strong interactions with one part or the other of the protein dimer, it was difficult to prioritize one over the other merely based on docking score or general knowledge. The similar phenomena have been observed in other docked compounds. This uncertainty is sometimes common in docking simulations, and selection among the multi docked poses for one compound is the key to the success of QSAR and other computational studies. In the docking simulations, similar binding positions and orientations have been observed among the poses of the similar compounds. As exampled in Figure 2B , the docked poses of compound 16 (CID: 660829) and 24 were superposed very well. Also their docked structures are well aligned with DPN. How to determine which theoretically derived binding mode is the closest to the status in the biological environment is a challenge. 4D QSAR was suggested to tackle the complication/ difficulty on the conformer selection for each compound by including multi-conformations of each small molecule into QSAR model construction. In the light of this method, a multiconformation 3D QSAR approach is introduced in the work to model the 3D QSAR models of cathepsin inhibitors. The conformers of each compound were generated from docking simulations and multi-conformers were included for each compound in QSAR constructions. Multi-step iteration was adopted to eliminate the abundant conformers to get the final models. To balance the accuracy, complexity, and computer time consumption, we included five top poses for each compound based on the Gscore in this work to evaluate the multiconformation QSAR concept.",

The PLS method has been used in numerous applications in correlating the activity with various physicochemical properties, especially when the number of descriptors is larger than the number of samples (incidents, row) in which a traditional multi-regression is not suitable. The PLS regression tries to build a correlation between a dependent variable (normally an activity) and several independent variables (property descriptors).",

In each step, the docked conformation with least correlation to other compounds was removed for each compound until a single pose was left for each of the compounds in the optimized dataset. The final optimized set with single conformer for each compound was used to construct the final models. The superposition of the selected docking pose for the 36 active compounds is shown in Figure 3 . It was seen that all these compounds aligned well against each other based on their molecular similarity and fit properly into the binding sites considering the structural feature (shape) and the physicochemical properties (pharmacophore) of the binding site. In this approach, the binding site information of the receptor was integrated into molecular alignment of small molecule ligands and was further integrated into 3D QSAR construction. The alignment based on the binding site focuses on the overall molecular fit and pharmacophore overlay, which resulted in a different image of compound superposition comparing to that derived by atom fitting as shown in Figure 3 , in which certain common molecular fragments used for alignment were over emphasized in fitting. Studies have showed that the docking alignment based on this approach resulted in better results than atom fit alignment method. [42] The statistical analyses for QSAR model construction were carried out based on the clusters of molecules selected as described earlier. An optimum numbers of components were first determined separately by cross-validation regression for both the CoMFA and CoMSIA models, which were then applied in the final analysis in the subsequent study. Both the CoMFA and CoMSIA models demonstrated good statistical results as shown in Table 2 (Whole set). The regression coefficient (r 2 ) and the cross-validated coefficient (q 2 ) of the QSAR model constructed by CoMFA are 0.999 and 0.605, respectively. The corresponding coefficients for the CoMSIA model are 0.997 and 0.605, respectively. There is no apparent difference in the quality of the two models, although results from the CoMSIA model show slightly higher cross-validated correlation coefficients than those from the CoMFA model, which indicates moderately enhanced predictability of the CoMSIA model. The standard errors of estimate for the two models are comparable as 0.012 and 0.054, respectively. In the CoMFA model, the steric descriptors make marginally larger contribution to the model than the electrostatic descriptors (0.568 vs. 0.432). In the CoMSIA model, the hydrophobic descriptors are the largest contributor and the electrostatic descriptors are the second followed by hydrogen acceptor and steric descriptors. No apparent correlation was noticed between these descriptors and experimental activity (logIC 50 ), so hydrogen donor descriptors were not included in the model construction. The result that the hydrophobic descriptor is the largest contributor for the CoMFA QSAR models is consistent with the observation that more than half of the binding site area is occupied by hydrophobic groups (will be discussed in following section as shown in Figure 8 ).",

These interactions (polar and non-polar) between these residues and ligand presumably play important roles in the ligand binding affinity and binding mode recognitions. To further explore the hypothetical interaction feature of a ligand with its receptor, the contributions and distributions of the steric, electrostatic, and hydrophobic factors are analyzed. Steric and electrostatic contour maps of the CoMFA models are shown in Figure 6 , and the steric, electrostatic, and hydrophobic contour maps of the CoMSIA models are shown in Figure  7A -7C. Compound 26 (CID:3241895, logIC 50 = \u22126.362) is shown along with the contour map to facilitate the analysis. Considering the steric contours of the CoMFA ( Figure 6A ) and CoMSIA ( Figure 7A ) models first, it is seen that two models gave a very similar predictions for the steric interactions. Both models suggest that the areas around thiofuran ring were disfavored regions (yellow). In addition, the areas on phenyl ring facing out of paper were also predicted as disfavored regions (yellow) by both models, which indicate that addition of bulky groups in these regions would not favor activity increase. The areas on the other side of the phenyl ring were predicted as favored regions (green), however, where an addition of bulky groups may increase the compound's activity. By checking the docked structure (Figure 8 ) of the compound in cathepsin B protein, it was noted that the favored region predicted from QSAR around the phenyl ring has space for extra substituent to fit in. On the other hand, the disfavored regions on the other side of the phenyl ring are already occupied by amino acid residues of the receptor, and there is no room for extra chemical group. Thus the suggestions from QSAR analysis of these two regions are consistent with those based on the docked structure. On the other hand, while the area around the thiofuran ring was predicted as disfavored regions, the docked structure shows open space in the surrounding area.",

The CoMFA model predicted a disfavored area near the sulfone group, which has a small portion of overlap with the favored areas predicted by CoMSIA model. It is reasonable to have disfavored areas around phenyl ring, while the prediction of disfavored areas around sulfone group seems contradictory to common understanding that the interaction of the polar group (sulfone) with polar amino acids increases ligand binding affinity. The hydrophobic property map ( Figure 7C ) from the CoMSIA model suggested two favored regions (cyan)-one area around the oxygen atom of ester and the other area located on one side of the phenyl ring nearby the triazole ring. Four disfavored regions (magenta) were identified as well by this analysis, which include areas located on the thiofuran ring, triazole ring, and the two sides of phenyl ring. Comparing the protein surface properties at the binding site (Figure 8 ), the locations of three predicted hydrophobic-favored areas match the hydrophobic areas on the protein surface. Also, some hydrophilic areas are found on the protein surface map close to the corresponding locations of the disfavored hydrophobic areas on contour map of the CoMSIA model. Generally speaking, suggestions from the contour map agree with the general feature of the protein surface properties around the protein binding site. All these predictions demonstrated that both the CoMFA and CoMSIA model provide valuable insights into the factors critical for determining the ligand binding and binding affinity against cathepsin B.",

If studied ligands have similar electrostatic patterns and are able to fit into the binding site, they will bind in a similar position with the same orientation. If one ligand has an opposite electrostatic pattern comparing to the other ligands, it could ideally be docked in with an orientation which is turned 180 degrees. However, a ligand in such a case may be aligned with the same orientation as the template ligand with the template based atom fitting method. The alignment from docking simulation, however, seems to have an edge over the templatebased atom-fitting alignment and produced nearly ideal results for such a situation. However, the effect of such ligands on the entire 3D QSAR model needs to be checked manually in case they may need to be treated as outliers.",

When applied to determining the conformation and alignment, docking simulations normally produces multi-conformations for a compound. A preferable conformation for a compound could be determined based on the knowledge of known bound structures, docking score, etc. in some case. But in other cases, it may be difficult to select a preferable conformation. In general, how to select the docked structure for a compound is tricky, challenging, and difficult, it sometimes means whether a successful model can be constructed. In this work, we introduced multi-conformation QSAR approach that utilizes multi-poses from docking simulation in QSAR model construction. The current approach allows gradual and step by step elimination of docking poses during the QSAR building process. It combines receptorbased docking simulation with ligand-based 3D QSAR (CoMFA and CoMSIA) by introducing the binding site properties into the ligand-based models, thus enhancing the prediction power of conventional QSAR models. The results of the statistical models demonstrated the power of using the current approach to determine conformation and alignment. These results provided insights into crucial structure features affecting ligandreceptor interactions and their binding affinities, thus demonstrating the advantage of the proposed approach for 3D QSAR modeling in drug design.",

Various methods were used to validate these studies, including LOO, cross-validation, Bootstrapping, and training-test set methods. In the last experiment, the activity of the tested compounds predicted by the models built from the training compounds was shown to be well in line with their experimental activity with a maximum error of 1 for CoMFA and CoMSIA models. All validations show that the models exhibited strong prediction for evaluating the inhibitory activity (logIC 50 ) of the compounds as cathepsin B inhibitors. The strong correlation between the calculated activity and the experimental activity demonstrated the robustness of the models, and the feasibility and advantage of the computational approach in this study.",

The areas on phenyl ring facing out of paper ( Figure 6A and 7A) are disfavored regions for bulky groups, while the areas on the other side of the phenyl ring are favored regions for bulky groups. It is also predicted that the area located around thiofuran ring and the area close to the sulfone group are favored electrostatic regions. The two analyses provided similar suggestions for favored and disfavored regions around the ligands when considering steric factors. These suggestions generally match the amino acids allocation and distribution around docked ligand at the binding site. The major features of the electrostatic maps from the two analyses are also consistent. The hydrophobic map for favored and unfavored areas derived from the CoMSIA analysis roughly matches the hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas of the protein surface of the binding site. Such analysis based on the CoMFA and CoMSIA results may provide valuable information for understanding the interactions between small molecules and cathepsin B, and thus can provide guidance for modifying the identified small molecules, or in designing novel ones for optimized potency and target specificity.",

When experimental structure data is unavailable, docking simulation is often chosen as an alternative approach to obtain \"active\" conformation for studied compounds. However, many studies have shown that selecting a conformation for a compound from multi-docked poses is tricky and difficult, and is often the leading cause of failure to achieve good QSAR models. In this work, we introduced a multi-conformation QSAR approach in an attempt to tackle this challenge. Multi-docked poses were introduced into statistical analysis for QSAR model construction and the final conformation for a compound is identified by an iterative procedure that optimizes the conformation selection for the best correlation. The final model is constructed based on the optimized conformer data set. This approach for conformation selection contributed substantially to the successful construction of the suggested models, which may significantly increase the chance to derive a model with satisfactory results in general.",

This work utilized receptor structure-based docking simulation to determine the \"active\" conformations of each ligand compound and the compound alignments. The success of the QSAR models demonstrated that the approach, by combining both receptor and ligand features, is superior to the conventional template atomfitting QSAR approach. The models built in this study provide detailed and deep insights for understanding the individual physical chemical elements affecting ligand-receptor interactions and provide valuable suggestions for novel inhibitor design and further chemical optimization. This would help to generate a library of cathepsin inhibitors and identify lead compounds with improved inhibition potency, target selectivity and specificity. This work will doubtlessly help the chemical optimization for this set of compounds, as well as facilitate the design and development of novo cathepsin B inhibitors as drugs to cure human diseases where the members of the papain superfamilies are known to play important roles.
