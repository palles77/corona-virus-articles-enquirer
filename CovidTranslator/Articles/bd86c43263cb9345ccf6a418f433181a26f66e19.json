During the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in 2003, illness was unexpected, caused by an uncharacterized virus with an uncertain mode of transmission and outcome (1) . Only through rapidly performed observational studies were we able to characterize disease course and better-understand predictors of clinical outcome (2, 3) . By nature of the rapid response to an unknown disease, treatment options were empirical and there was little opportunity to test these choices with interventional trials using rigorous methodologies (4) . In contradistinction, pandemic influenza is well-known and has a frequency that recurs but it has sufficient duration between pandemics to allow a degree of complacency for some, and the illusion of time with which to plan a research response.",

After its first description, the 1918 influenza A H1N1 (5) virus underwent at least two major mutations that are believed to have led to its increased pathogenicity (5) . Case reports and pathologic studies from 1918 provide rich clinical descriptions; death followed from aggressive secondary bronchopneumonia, influenza-related lung disease, associated cyanosis, and cardiac collapse (6) . During the 1918 pandemic, there was unexplained excess influenza mortality in persons 20 to 40 yrs of age, possibly because of limited native immunity and/or a vigorous immune response directed against the virus in healthy young persons (6) . In 1918, however, clinical investigation was in its infancy; there was limited opportunity for identification of independent risk factors through rigorous cohort or case-control studies and virtually no opportunity for clinical trials. Today, even without vaccination, the mortality of the 1918 pandemic almost certainly would be reduced because of the availability of intensive care units (ICUs), antibiotics, and antiviral medications, innovations which are the result of much of the clinical research of the mid 20th century. For today's ICU practitioners, the \"cost\" will be an increase in critical care admissions and length of stay among patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (7) (8) (9) (10) .",

This can be facilitated by a preexisting template containing core elements modified to the particular scenario. Determining appropriate definitions for those ill (the \"cases\") is important, and infectious diseases may require evolving confirmatory laboratory testing. For example, for patients with 2009 influenza A (H1N1), diagnostic testing was not widely available in all clinical settings (the etiology was uncertain and testing was not ubiquitous), and although nasopharyngeal swabs for polymerase chain reaction are associated with excellent sensitivity and specificity when properly performed early after symptom onset, the sensitivity in critically ill patients may not be as good. Failure to include patients with influenza-associated critical illness but with negative nasopharyngeal diagnostic testing results may systematically alter the knowledge base that emerges. Therefore, categorization into confirmed, probable, or possible/suspected allows for greater retrospective precision in defining clinical cases and avoidance of inclusion of patients with non-H1N1 illness. Research questions must be devised and vetted efficiently and decisions must be made about the most important projects. For small or geographically confined outbreaks, when it is possible to collect information on all patients, a cohort study may be ideal. For larger outbreaks, a case series collecting data only for those with illness is more efficient. With the addition of data collection from appropriate patients without illness but with otherwise similar characteristics and opportunity for disease (controls), a case-control study can help to identify patient-based and exposure associations with the disease, which is a critical step for determining risk factors for outcomes.",

In usual times, the process of protocol generation for observational studies and application to a research ethics board may take a minimum of 2 to 3 mos; during most outbreaks, the response ideally should occur in days. This requires an efficient collaboration with research ethics boards and is the subject of another contribution to this Supplement (11) . For observational studies recording preexisting data without personal identifying information, we believe there should be no requirement for patient or surrogate-level consent, because this can be associated with authorization bias and invalid results (12) . If the research involves collection of patient samples aside from clinical care or involves an interventional design, then there still may be provision for a \"no consent\" or \"deferred consent\" model if there is negligible risk and no other reasonable manner with which to perform necessary research (12) .",

Some duplication of effort can be desirable, especially when it may identify geographic variation in clinical descriptions, care, or outcomes that are instructive to the response. To facilitate the comparison of findings, similar projects should be undertaken with similar designs and definitions.

Eligibility criteria that define the patients must be included. For the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, there may be a tendency to include only patients with confirmed H1N1. However, this could prove challenging if diagnostic testing is not 100% sensitive, or if confirmatory testing is not always available or is not be the same in each center (e.g., polymerase chain reaction vs. viral culture vs. enzyme-linked assay). Thus, confirmation may be foregone completely if demand outstrips capacity, making categories of confirmed, probable, and suspected valuable (14) . Similarly, although it is possible that H1N1 will comprise the majority of influenza burden in some jurisdictions in 2009 to 2010, it is reasonable to consider including all influenza and subcategorizing when this is known. This will allow comparison of clinical syndromes to other strains and simplify eligibility for study personnel when subtypes are not known. For a critical illnessfocused project, there should be some reasonable definition of \"critically ill.\" Criteria should be defined according to the patient and the illness, not the geographic area of admission (e.g., the ICU). ICU admission criteria are not universal and are often dictated by institutional numbers of beds, which may be exceeded in pandemic periods or may not exist in parts of the developing world. Potential definitions of critical illness include ventilation failure (defined by clinical criteria or receipt of mechanical ventilation), oxygenation failure (defined by clinical criteria and/or receipt of high level of inspired fraction of oxygen), or hypotension (defined by clinical criteria and/or receipt of intravenous vasoactive medications) in any hospital area. If this non-ICU-centric approach is taken, then a mechanism for finding such patients is needed if they do not naturally come under the care of the critical care team. For case series, all and consecutive patients fulfilling the definition must be described to avoid the risk for selective reporting, which often leads to inclusion of the sickest patients-those who more obviously come to clinical attention because of illness severity. This can lead to falsely high mortality estimations in the early stages of pandemics. To facilitate hospital or regional incidence estimates, the case definitions should be harmonized at each level, ideally with international agencies.",

Despite their differences, these tools contain a surprising overlap of core elements. One flexible approach is to collect physiologic data on the variables necessary for calculation of several (Appendix 1), which then facilitates comparison and risk adjustment among different data sets if one standard cannot be broadly agreed on a priori. Collecting a limited amount of daily data on physiology and organ function, laboratory parameters, treatments, and ventilation may have some benefit, but only those deemed of potential direct relevance to the condition should be captured (e.g., only measures of oxygenation or creatine kinase). If daily data are to be collected on organ function, then variables should be limited to those that can be transformed into standard and validated scoring systems, such as Sequential/ Sepsis Organ Failure Assessment (19) , Multiple Organ Dysfunction (20) , or Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (21) scores. Especially important is avoiding the temptation to collect data on each day of critical illness, because the burden on the research team can be overwhelming and the information might never be used.

In April 2009, critical care colleagues in Mexico City faced with the early burden of H1N1-related critical illness contacted Canadian colleagues to collaborate on an observational study. Using experience gained through the SARS outbreak and reporting system, the group constructed a case report form for critically ill patients and then performed a pilot test of the form with clinicians and research coordinators in both countries. Research ethics approval for an observational study was granted on April 30, 2009, and the forms were disseminated in Canada and Mexico and to critical care societies in other regions of the world on May 3 (http://www.ccctg.ca/ news_events.php). Data were transmitted by secure research fax to the methods center and preliminary results from the Mexico City experience were presented to the American Thoracic Society on May 19, 2009 . The observational study continued in Canada and Mexico through August 2009, and both experiences were published together online on October 12, 2009 (8, 9) , in conjunction with presentation of results at the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine's annual scientific symposium in Vienna. The case report form underwent modification, was transitioned to Web-based data entry by October 2009, and is currently enrolling patients in university and community adult centers and in all pediatric critical care hospitals (in conjunction with the PALISI Network) in Canada.",

As soon as possible after admission, parents are approached for consent, and symptomatic children confirmed to have probable influenza infection from preliminary screening tests (rapid testing or direct fluorescent antibody) or confirmed influenza infection from viral culture or polymerase chain reaction-based testing are enrolled. Data collection consists of patient demographics, clinical information including vaccination status, risk factors, medical history, clinical status on day of admission, bacterial and viral test results on presentation, and ICU and hospital course via medical chart abstraction and survey questionnaire. The same computerized database is also used for the Canadian pediatric epidemiologic component of the ICU-Flu study. All 17 pediatric ICUs across Canada are screening daily for patients.
