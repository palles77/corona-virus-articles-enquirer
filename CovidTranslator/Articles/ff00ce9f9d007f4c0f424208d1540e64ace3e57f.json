The methods used have significant differences based on tissue source, cell isolation, culture conditions, and assessment of culture purity. We modified and optimized a method for generating tracheal epithelial cultures from Syrian golden hamsters and characterized the cultures for cell composition and function. Soon after initial plating, the epithelial ceils reached a high transepithelial resistance and formed tight junctions. The cells differentiated into a heterogeneous, nlulticellnlar culture containing ciliated, secretory, and basal ceils after culture at an air-liquid interface (ALI). The secretory cell populations initially consisted of MUC5ACpositive goblet cells and MUC5ACICCSP double-positive ceils, but the makeup changed to predominantly Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP)-positive Clara cells after 14 d. The ciliated cell populations differentiated rapidly after ALl, as judged by the appearance of 6 tubulin IV-positive cells. The cultures produced mucus, CCSP, and trypsin-like proteases and were capable of wound repair as judged by increased expression of matrilysin. Our method provides an efficient, high-yield protocol for producing differentiated hamster tracheal epithelial cells that can be used for a variety of in vitro studies including tracheal cell differentiation, airway disease mechanisms, and pathogen-host interactions.",

In contrast, cell lines are grown easily and have defined characteristics (inducible gene expression, cell type-specific markers, etc.) but are usually derived from a single cell type and cannot perform all the functions attributed to the original organ or tissue.",

Many groups have cultured tracheal epithelial cells (TECs) for evaluating airway growth and development (Wu and Smith, 1982; Lee et al., 1984; Kaartinen et al., 1993; You et al., 2002) as well as pathogenhost interactions (Goldman et al., 1982; Look et al., 2001; Sinn et al., 2002; Waiters et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2002) , and protocols have ranged from tracheal ring organ cuhures (Collier et al., 1977) to enzymatic dissociation followed by various culture conditions (Goldman and Baseman, 1980; Lee et al., 1984; Wu et al., 1985; Yamaya et al., 1992) . The most successful techniques have described culturing at an air-liquid interface (ALI) (Whitcutt et al., 1988; 5~amaya et al., 1992; Robison et al., 1993; You et al., 2002) . Specific hormone media formulations and ALI culture conditions have allowed researchers to create heterogeneous cultures that differentiate into a variety of cell types, including the major cell types found in the airways (Wu, 1997) .",

            "text": "The use of Syrian golden hamsters as a small animal model for a variety of human pathogens has been of particular interest to us. Microbial pathogens ranging from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavims (Buchholz et al., 2004) , West Nile virus (Mon'ey et al., 2004) , Nipah virus (Wong et al., 2003) , South American hantaviruses (Hooper et al., 2001; Milazzo et al., 2002) , human parainftuenza virus 3 (Tao et al., 1999) , Bordetella pertussis (Collier et al., 1977) You et al., 2002 . Lee et al., 1984 Wu et al., 1985; Yamaya et al., 1992; Kaartinen et al., 1993 : You et al., 2002 ' Karp et al., 2002; You et al., 2002 . (Fisher et al., 2003 , eastern equine encephalitis virus (Paessler et al., 2004) , and leisbmania (Melby et al., 2001) have been shown to infect and cause disease in hamsters. Because several of these pathogens interact with the airway epithelium, we sought to optimize and streamline protocols for the isolation and culture of well-differentiated hamster TECs. Our protocol is based on other TEC protocols, using mouse (You et al., 2002) , guinea pig (Robison et al., 1993) , human (Yamaya et ah, 1992 (Yamaya et ah, , 2002 Karp et al., 2002) , and hamster (Lee et al., 1984; Wu et al., 1985; Moiler et al., 1987; Whitcutt et al., 1988) tissue. We achieved a high efficiency of cell isolation per hamster (5 X 10 s to 6 \u2022 105 cells/trachea), resulting in the seeding of 10-15 wells/animal. The cells are initially devoid of significant numbers of ciliated or secretory cells but rapidly differentiate into a heterogeneous culture containing ciliated, seeretm% mucous, and basal cells. Cell types were quantified by immunostaining, characterized by electron microscopy, and possessed secretory and ciliated cell activities. Thus, hamster TECs can provide a faithful in vitro representation of the in vivo tracheal epithelium for studying a variety of systems. Ham~ter TEC isolation. Six-to eight-week-old female Syrian golden hamsters (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were euthanized by isofluorane inhalation and sodium pentobarbital injection (400 mg/kg injected intraperitoneally). Tracheas were excised from below the larynx to the major bronchi. The explanted tracheas were digested for 12-18 h with 0.3% pronase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in Ham's F-12 with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ~xg/ml streptomycin followed by deoxyfibonuclease treatment (0.5 mg/ml in Ham's F-12, Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) for 10 rain at 4 ~ C (You et al., 2002) . Cells were resuspended in TEC Basic (Table 1) with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and plated in a 3.5-cm cell culture plate for 3 h at 37 ~ C, 5% CO 2 to remove contaminating fibroblasts (You et al., 2002) . The recovered epithelial cells were plated on thin-layer collagen-coated 0.4-lxm pore 0.33 cm 2 Transwell-Clear (Corning Costal, Corning, NY) supported membranes (You et al., 2002) . Collagen coating was performed by applying 50 pg/ml rat tail collagen type I (diluted in 0.02 N glacial acetic acid) to each membrane, incubating overnight at 4 ~ C, and washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before cell plating. Cells were plated at a density of 1 \u2022 105 cells/era 2, and typical yields were 5 X 10 s to 6 \u2022 10 ~ cells/trachea. Cells were grown in TEC Plus (Table 1) , and apical and basolateral media were changed every 2 d (Lee et al., 1984; Wu et al., 1985; Yamaya et al., 1992; Robison et al., 1993; You et al., 2002) . Transepithelial resistance (TER) was measured with the Millipore Millicell-ERS (Millipore, Bedford, MA). On reaching a TER of >1000 t)-cm 2, the apical media was removed to create an ALI (Whitcutt et al., 1988; Yamaya et al., 1992; Robison et al., 1993) , and the basolateral media was then replaced with TEC MM (Table 1 ) (Yamaya et al., 1992; Karp et al., 2002; You et al., 2002) . The cells were routinely infected between days 10 and 14 ALl.",

Mucus was renmved by washing twice with warm TEC Basic. Cells were infected through the apical chamber in a total volume of 50 tzl for 1 h at 37 ~ C in the presence or absence of 10 ~g/ml N-acetyl trypsin (Sigma). The inoculum was removed and washed twice with Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM), 10% FBS, to remove and inactivate trypsin, and once with PBS. The apical inoculum was replaced with 50 Ixl DMEM, (GIBCO), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 bLg/ml streptomycin (GIBCO) either with or without 10 Ixg/ml N-acetyl trypsin. The basolateral media was changed at the time of infection to TEC MM. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were infected in the presence or absence of 10 btg/ml of N-acetyl trypsin according to standm'd procedures (Paterson and Lamb, 1993; McCown et al., 2003) . The apical supernatant was collected for plaque assay at the indicated h postinfection (hpi). Plaque assays for hamster TEC infections were performed on MDCK cells as described previously (Paterson and Lamb, 1993; McCown et al., 2003) . loading buffer (Paterson and Lamb, 1993) , run through a 22-gauge needle, sonicated for 15 rain at 42 kHz, and boiled for 15 rain. For blotting of CCSE 13-mercaptoethanol was added to lysates at a final concentration of 144 mM before boiling. Lysates were run on a 15% polyacrylanfide mini gel (BioRad, Hercules, CA) for 3 h at 75 V, and for detection of CCSR proteins were separated on a 17.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 4 M urea. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore hnmobilon-P) at 100 V for 1 h (Mini Transblot, BioRad) and blocked in PBS with 5% dry nfilk. Blots were incubated in primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS supplemented with 1% Tween 20, and developed using the Amersham (Piscataway, NJ) ECL-Plus substrate.",

Isolated epithelial cells were plated into Transwell chambers at a density of 1 x l0 s cells/cm 2, and the formation of tight junctions was monitored by measuring the TER across the cell layer at the indicated d before and after ALI (Fig. 1A) . The TER increased postplating and remained > 5 0 0 l~-cm 2, decreased slightly after ALI, but quickly regained a TER of > 1 5 0 0 t)-cm 2 through 14 d ALI (Fig. 1A) . Tight junction formation was also evaluated by monitoring the subcellular localization of ZO-1, a protein that specifically localizes to the apical tight junctions of polarized ceils (Denker and Nigam, 1998) . Zonular occludin 1 staining showed some cell junction localization in addition to a diffuse localization pattern at -6 d ALI (Fig. 1B) ; however, a typical tight junction pattern predominated by -3 d ALI (Fig. 1C) . This staining pattern remained constant ( Fig.  1D and E) and illustrated the increase in cell numbers that occurred after ALL Hamster TEC morphology and uhrastructure. At 0 and 3 d ALI the apical cell surface remained flat, with few ciliated cells ( Fig.  2A and B) . However, under high-power magnification, the tight junctions and microvilli could be observed ( Fig. 2A) . Figure 2A dem-onstrates the presence of a ciliated cell, which are found at a low frequency (<5%) postplating. After ALI, total cell numbers increased, and it was evident that ciliated cell differentiation was occurring ( Fig. 2C-E) . By 14 d ALI (Fig. 2E) , the cellular morphology resembled that of the adult hamster trachea (Fig. 2F) . Transmission electron microscopy revealed both ciliated and nonciliated cell populations (Fig. 3A-D) that had well-formed tight junctions (Fig. 3E) . Many nonciliated cells contained large apically localized vesicles, characteristic of secretory cells (Fig. 3B) . Cells that morphologically resembled basal cells were detected below the apical cell layer (Fig. 3C) . These data indicate that the hamster TEC culture forms polarized cultures consisting of ciliated, nonciliated, and basal cells, with morphology closely resembling the hamster trachea.",

The CCSP single-positive population steadily increased to become the predominant secretory cell type at roughly 30% of the total cell population by 15 d ALI (Fig. 5B) .

HA0 is the unprocessed tolm of HA, whereas HA, and HA2 are the subunits produced after cleavage. Viral antigen spread in hamster TEC cultures infected at an MOI = 0.01 was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, using a monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the influenza A virus M2 protein at 24 hpi in cells that were (D) mock infected, (E) infected and cultured with trypsin, and (F) infected and cultured without trypsin.",

This is in contrast to infection of most transformed cell lines, MDCK ceils serving as an example in Fig. 6A and B. A 12-h time point was taken because HA is not detectable at later time points because the infection of MDCK cells in the absence of trypsin is abortive. Finally, infected hamster TECs produced comparable numbers of viral antigen-positive cells in the presence or absence of exogenous trypsin at 24 hpi ( Fig. 6D-F ). Using various cell markers, we determined that viral antigen was present in ciliated and secretory cells (data not shown). These data indicate that unlike most transformed cell lines, hamster TECs produce a trypsin-like enzyme capable of cleaving the influenza A virus HA protein.",

At 1 and 12 h postinjury, the cells had a low TER, which was restored to >500 l)-cm 2 by 24 h postinjury, after which a high resistance was maintained (Fig. 7A) . At 12 and 24 h postinjury, the cells were monitored for matrilysin expression using immunofluorescence confoeal microscopy ( Fig. 7B and D) . At 12 h postinjury, matrilysin expression was detected in cells surrounding the injury (Fig. 7B) . By 24 h postinjury, matrilysin expression was still present within the scarred region, but the wound had closed, and this correlated with a high TER (Fig. 7D) . Nuclei staining was used to monitor the migration of ceils into the wound ( Fig. 7C and E) . These data suggest that hamster TECs are capable of wound repair.",

Hamster tracheal cultures have been reported (Goldman and Baseman, 1980; Lee et al., 1984; Niles et al., 1988; Whitcutt et al., 1988; Wu, 1997) , and in this study we modified, updated, and streamlined the methodology. The use of protease dissociation for cell isolation resulted in a high yield of epithelial cells (roughly 5 \u2022 105 to 6 \u2022 1@ cells/trachea), and use of hormone-and serum-supplemented medias led to rapid proliferation and differentiation of the cells at ALL We chose to limit our cell-type analysis to cells that could be identified with antibodies to well-characterized cell markers in order to objectively characterize the cellular makeup of the cuhures and used electron microscopy primarily to assess the uhrastructure of the cultures. We found that our cultures produced a heterogeneous cell population, similar to the trachea in vivo, including ciliated and nonciliated cells. The nonciliated cells were identified as basal (electron microscopy), goblet (MUC5AC-positive), and Clara (CCSP-positive) cells and were capable of producing and secreting mucus and mucus-associated proteins. Interestingly, a high percentage of ceils expressed both MUC5AC and CCSP immediately after ALI. Whether Clara cell differentiation is completely independent of MUC5AC expression, proceeds through a MUC5AC/ CCSP positive intemmdiate cell, or goblet cells themselves can differentiate into Clara cells through the double-positive intermediate remains to be investigated. It is interesting to note the mounting evidence indicating that Clara cells can differentiate into MUC5ACpositive goblet cells, perhaps through a MUC5AC/CCSP doublepositive population, in response to interleukin-13 or antigen challenge in murine models of airway hypelwesponsiveness (Reader et al., 2003; Shahzeidi et al., 2003) . The presence of both cell populations in hamster TEC cultures allows for the study of the interdependence of these two cell populations (Boers et al., 1999; Hayashi et al., 2004) .",

This differentiation after ALI is consistent with the isolation of a pro-genitor population as seen in other tracheal isolation protocols (Goldman and Baseman, 1980; You et al., 2002) . In vivo, the secretory cells that populate the airways consist of Clara and goblet cells (Wu, 1997) . These cell types were present in our cultures and in roughly similar quantities to that observed in hamster tracheas (data not shown). Secretory cells predominated early, as compared with ciliated cells, consistent with reports that suggest that secretory cells may serve as a progenitor population (Wu, 1997) . The MUC5AC-positive population was found to be a small percentage, whereas the CCSP-positive population predominated as the major secretory cell in the mature hamster TEC culture (Figs. 4 and 5) as well as in vivo (data not shown). Transmission electron microscopy analysis indicated the cells morphologically consistent with basal cells (Fig. 3C) , suggesting that this cell type may constitute the remaining 20-30% of the cells in this culture.",

Under light microscopy, the wound was no longer visible at 24 h postinjury (data not shown). Matrilysin expression is upregulated in response to injury in healthy cells that surround an injury (McGuire et al., 2003) , and indeed it appeared to be induced on injury of the hamster TECs. Interestingly, there was a low level of matrilysin expression in mock cells as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis (data not shown). This is consistent with reports that in vivo, matrilysin is constitutively expressed in the airways (Dunsmore et al., 1998) and supports the role of matrilysin in other responses, such as immune modulation and airway homeostasis (Parks et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "The hamster TEC culture does mimic the in vivo tracheal environment and will be a useful system to evaluate tracheal function. Recently, Syrian golden hamsters have been described as suitable small animal models for many emerging infectious diseases, including SARS coronavirus (Buchholz et al., 2004) , Nipah virus (Wong et al., 2003) , and the South American hantaviruses, Andes and Maporal viruses (Hooper et al., 2001; Milazzo et al., 2002) . These viruses are transmitted through inhalation, result in high morbidity and mortality in human infections, and require high containment facilities (biosafety levels 3 or 4) in which to conduct research (Lopez et al., 1996; Chua et al., 2000; Ksiazek et al., 2003) . The respiratory tract is likely to play an important role in the disease progression of these pathogens, whether as a site of virus replication or simply as a brawler preventing virus access to other organs in the animal. Therefore, the use of in vitro systems, such as the hamster TEC culture, could provide a preferred environment to study virushost interactions, as well as testing of antiviral molecules.",
