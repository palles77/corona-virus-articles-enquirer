A large amount of glycyrrhizic acid (0.23 mg/ml herbal juice; 184 mg/day) was detected in the tonic by high-performance liquid chromatography.

The normal plasma cortisol in a state of pseudohyperaldosteronism found in this patient point to the following causes: 11deoxycorticosterone (DOC) producing adenoma, Liddle's syndrome (activation mutation in Na + channel), and failure of the 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11b-HSDH-2) enzyme to remove all cortisol such as apparent mineralocorticoid excess (hereditary defect) and licorice ingestion (inhibition).

Since cortisol and aldosterone are similar steroid hormones, the enzyme is necessary to inactivate cortisol before it can bind the aldosterone receptor inside principal cells [13] . When 11b-HSDH-2 is inhibited, an aldosterone-like effect is promulgated, which suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and causes volume expansion, hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. The amount of licorice necessary to produce hypokalemia varies. It has been shown that daily intake of 100 mg glycyrrhizic acid can produce these adverse effects [14] . Therefore, it is not surprising that this patient developed profound hypokalemia and paralysis after taking 184 mg glycyrrhizic acid daily for 2 months. The rather mild hypertension observed in this patient may be due to coexisting Na + wasting related to partially obstructive uropathy from prostate cancer. Despite controversies within the medical community regarding the effectiveness of complementary/alternative medicine (CAM), recent surveys have shown that almost half of cancer patients in Western countries use CAM therapies [5, 6] . Therefore, the prudent physician should at least acknowledge CAM use among patients and keep potential interactions and adverse effects in mind. In addition to the conventional treatments for prostate cancer, including radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, androgen deprivation therapy, and combined chemotherapy, saw palmetto and licorice are commonly used CAM therapies for hormone-refractory prostate cancer [17] . A licorice-containing mixture, PC-SPES, has been shown to be effective in prostate cancer patients, although the clinical trials enrolled only small numbers of patients [12] . The possible anticarcinogenic mechanisms include induction of cell-cycle arrest and cell-growth inhibition, estrogenic effects, scavenging of free radicals, and so on [8, 4] .",

The German Commission E recommends that licorice should not be used for longer than 4-6 weeks to avoid side effects. Once hypokalemia occurs, K + supplementation and/or spironolactone (100 mg per day) helps to correct the hypokalemia with cessation of licorice intake. A prolonged treatment course is needed because of the long half-life and substantial enterohepatic circulation of glycyrrhetinic acid (licorice's metabolite) [16] . Finally, early use of spironolactone may reduce the risk of licorice-induced hypokalemia.",
