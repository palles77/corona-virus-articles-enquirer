However, in other cases, TNF will cause cell death. Considering the abnormal proliferation and activation of rheumatoid arthritis synovioblasts, the proper rate of synovioblast apoptosis could possibly relieve arthritis. However, the mechanism mediating TNF-induced synovioblast survival versus cell death in RA is not fully understood. Our objective was to study the role of CD147 in TNF downstream pathway preference in RA synovioblasts. We found that overexpressing TNF in synovial tissue did not increase the apoptotic level and, in vitro, TNFinduced mild synovioblast apoptosis and promoted IL-6 secretion. CD147, which was highly expressed in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs), increased the resistance of synovioblasts to apoptosis under TNF stimulation. Downregulating CD147 both increased the apoptotic rate and inhibited I\u03baB kinase (IKK)/I\u03baB/NF-\u03baB pathway-dependent proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Further, we determined that it was the extracellular portion of CD147 and not the intracellular portion that was responsible for synovioblast apoptosis resistance. CD147 monoclonal antibody inhibited TNF-induced proinflammatory cytokine production but had no effect on apoptotic rates. Thus, our study indicates that CD147 is resistant to TNFinduced apoptosis by promoting IKK/I\u03baB/NF-\u03baB pathway, and the extracellular portion of CD147 is the functional region.",

RA affects approximately 1 % of the population, with high incidence in women and old people [2] . Abnormal accumulation of fibroblasts, macrophages, and lymphocytes in synovial joints finally causes the destruction of the bone and cartilage [3] . Rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) are regarded as direct inducers of such damage. They receive molecular signals from macrophages and lymphocytes, and they secrete metalloproteinases (MMPs), IL-6, IL-8, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) among others [4] . One of the most important upstream signals for RASFs is TNF, a highly expressed cytokine in both serum and synovium of RA patients [5] .",

The apoptotic rate of RASFs under TNF stimulation could be significant, because it could both decrease the number of effective RASFs and inhibit TNF-related immune activation. With two different downstream signaling pathways, NF-\u03baB-dependent or NF-\u03baB-independent cell survival versus caspase-related apoptosis [10] , TNF signaling could be influenced by certain other important molecules that help to 'switch' between different patterns [11] .

CD147 is a receptor for cyclophilin A (CypA) and PfRh5, and it contributes to tumor metastasis, inflammation, and pathogen (plasmodium falciparum and coronavirus) infection [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Our previous works have proven that CD147 is upregulated in RA synoviocytes, including RASFs and macrophage-like cells [21] . CD147 overexpression can increase MMP production and invasiveness in synoviocytes. In addition, CD147 on RASFs induces the upregulation of VEGF and HIF-1, which further promotes angiogenesis in synovium and causes persistence of synovitis [22] . CD147/HAb18 monoclonal antibody can inhibit cartilage erosion and synovitis in the SCID mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis [23] . However, so far, the role of CD147 in TNF-induced RASF apoptosis has not been studied. It was reported that in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CD147 inhibits HCC cell apoptosis under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [24] . Others have shown that TNF is the key in the cross talk between ER stress and oxidative stress [25] . These data highlight the possibility that CD147 plays a negative role in TNF-related apoptosis.",

Real-time PCR results demonstrated that CD147 expression decreased after lentivirus transfection, and CD147 downregulation (A6 group) inhibited IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression after TNF treatment while revealed no obvious difference when treating with both TNF and the NF-\u03baB inhibitor TPCK (Fig. 4a) . Western blot assay demonstrated that downregulated CD147 decreased I\u03baB kinase (IKK) protein level. Meanwhile, using RelA antibody, we found three main bands around 65 kD (RelA), 115 kD (RelA-NF\u03baB I complex), and 160 kD (I\u03baB-RelA-NF\u03baB I complex). In RASF A6, 160 kD (I\u03baB-RelA-NF\u03baB I complex) band was much stronger than RASF CTL and RASF NC, which indicated that CD147 probably played a role in collapse of I\u03baB-RelA-NF\u03baB I complex (Fig. 4b, c ). In addition, CD147 downregulation (RASF A6) significantly enhanced TNF-induced apoptosis; however, downregulated CD147 made no difference in apoptotic rate when using both TNF and the NF-\u03baB inhibitor TPCK (Fig. 4d, e) . IKK mRNA expression was decreased in A6 group, which illustrated that CD147 positively regulated IKK transcription (Fig. 4f) .",

Infliximab, a TNF antibody, has already proven its effectiveness in treating RA patients. However, in other cases, TNF is also known as an inducer of apoptosis and necroptosis. Apoptosis is dominant in physiological cell death, which plays an important role in individual development [29] and in responding to mild stress.

The proper degree of RASF apoptosis, for one thing, can alleviate the bone and cartilage erosion by reducing the number of fibroblasts; for another, it can consume more TNF, which would otherwise cause extra immune responses. In our study, we found that TNF expression was not correlated with apoptotic rates between RA and OA synovial tissues, both of which remained at a relatively low level, and TNF only caused mild apoptosis in vitro. The key question is which TNF signaling pattern is preferred in RA synovium, the NF-\u03baB-dependent (or NF-\u03baB-independent) cell survival pathway or the caspase-related apoptosis pathway. The factors contributing to TNF signaling pattern preference include the concentration of TNF, the time course of TNF stimulation [31] , and the expression of other important molecules. The high level and long duration of TNF expression in serum and synovium of RA patients have been proven in clinical studies [32] [33] [34] ; nevertheless, little is known about the vital molecules that can switch TNF signaling between the different patterns.",
