Patients with chronic lymphoid malignancies and those receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy, such as BMT recipients, have impaired antibody production which predisposes to infection with encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. The use of indwelling central venous catheters and mucosal damage caused by chemotherapy and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection 4 allows penetration by commensal flora. In recent years changes in cytotoxic chemotherapy have rendered the oropharynx a major portal of entry for \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci. Likewise, splenectomy undertaken as treatment or for diagnosis renders the patient susceptible to infection with encapsulated organisms such as Str. pneumoniae. Others have pre-existing sites of chronic infection such as middle-ear disease or bronchiectasis, which may act as reservoirs of infection with organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Infections with Gram-positive bacteria, especially the coagulase-negative staphylococci and \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci, have increased in frequency over the past two decades. In the EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) participatory centers the incidence of bacteremia due to Gram-positive organisms increased from 29% 5 to 67% during the 1970s and 1980s. 6 This increase correlates with the escalating use of central venous catheters, the development of alternative high-dose chemotherapy with attendant mucositis, and better prevention of Gram-negative infections. However, subsequent trials have shown a fall again, possibly associated with the decline in quinolone prophylaxis usage associated with emerging resistance. Of recent interest is the finding that cell-wall deficient (mostly Gram-positive) bacteria may be responsible for up to 25% of episodes of neutropenic fever in BMT recipients. 7 Gram-negative bacteria continue to cause some of the most serious episodes of sepsis. Infections caused by the Enterobacteriaceae and Ps. aeruginosa carry a mortality of 40-60%. 8, 9 Oropharyngeal candidosis is extremely common in patients not receiving prophylaxis, while invasive candidosis and aspergillosis account for 20-30% of fatal infections when treating acute leukemia. 10, 11 Invasive aspergillosis is the most important infective cause of death in childhood acute myeloid leukemia 12 ",

Initially oral quinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin) were compared in a number of studies with placebo, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and non-absorbable antibiotics. In the majority of these the 4-quinolone treated patients had significantly fewer Gram-negative bacterial infections, a delayed onset of fever and a reduction in the number of days of fever. Importantly, a reduction in mortality was not demonstrated. 29 There has been concern that quinolone resistance is increasing in some units 30 and this has led to the discontinuation of quinolone prophylaxis. However, initial meta-analysis did not show this to be a significant problem, and recent EORTC and Health Protection Agency (HPA) data further support these findings. A sequential study has shown that combining ciprofloxacin with colistin was associated with no significant change in quinolone resistance over a 12-year period. 31 However, a more recent meta-analysis 32 that evaluated 95 randomized trials in afebrile neutropenic patients (the majority of whom had hematological malignancies) comparing antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo, no intervention or with another antibiotic class has shown a significant reduction in the risk for death when compared with placebo or no treatment (relative risk [RR], 0.67). The survival benefit was more substantial when the analysis was limited to fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinolone prophylaxis reduced the risk for all-cause mortality (RR 0.52, 95% CI, 0.35-0.77), as well as infectionrelated mortality, fever, clinically documented infections and microbiologically documented infections. Although there was no significant increase in resistant bacteria with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, the length of observation may have been insufficient to detect the emergence of resistant bacteria. All prophylactic antibiotics were associated with an increased risk for adverse events.",

The first trial evaluated levofloxacin prophylaxis from the initiation of chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery, in higher-risk, mainly inpatient adult leukaemic or stem cell transplant patients in whom chemotherapy-induced neutropenia was expected to last for more than 7 days. The second trial was in the outpatient setting and evaluated levofloxacin prophylaxis after chemotherapy for solid tumors and lymphomas for patients anticipated to have periods of neutropenia of 7 days or less. The effects of prophylaxis were similar between both patient groups in the two trials, as were mortality and tolerability. Both trials failed to demonstrate a significant survival benefit with prophylaxis. The results reflected previous meta-analyses and a review of both trials demonstrated that the numbers needed to treat to prevent one death by any cause was 24 in all patients and 43 in patients with an expected duration of neutropenia of >7 days.",

Some centers advocate prophylaxis against pneumococcal infection in allogeneic HSCT recipients, functionally asplenic patients and in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD.

Traditionally the significant organisms have been the Enterobacteriaceae and Ps. aeruginosa, which carry a mortality of 40-60%. 8, 9 Earlier regimens included an aminoglycoside in combination with a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic in an attempt to achieve broadspectrum and synergistic activity against organisms such as Ps. aeruginosa. Aminoglycoside use carries the inherent risk of renal and ototoxicity, and data for its combination with \u03b2-lactams in empirical therapy have been conflicting. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend aminoglycosides in patients at high risk of pseudomonal infections (history of previous pseudomonal infections or the presence of ecthyma gangrenosum) whereas Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines suggest they may be added in cases of progressive infection or documented resistant Gram-negative infection. A Cochrane review of 68 randomized controlled trials 65 concluded that for the primary outcome measure of all-cause mortality, there was no significant difference between monotherapy and combination (RR = 0.85). For the second outcome measure of treatment failure there was an advantage to monotherapy in 37 trials comparing different \u03b2-lactams (this was for patients with documented infection or hematological malignancy) (RR = 0.86). There was no difference between the two comparator arms in the number of superinfections but significantly more adverse events in the combination group for nephrotoxicity. Another meta-analysis also concluded that monotherapy is as effective as aminoglycoside-\u03b2-lactam combinations. 66 Data from patients in non-neutropenic studies have shown that once-daily dosing aminoglycoside regimens are as efficacious as multiple-dose regimens.",

This seemed prudent, although the IDSA suggests that vancomycin may be used in initial regimens in institutions where fulminant Gram-positive infections are common, particularly where MRSA may be a problem, and discontinued 3-4 days later if such an infection is not identified. 90 There is also evidence that the choice of broad-spectrum agent for empirical therapy can influence the emergence of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE). 91 At present glycopeptide-intermediate Staph. aureus (GISA) infections are not a significant problem in the UK, but provide another reason for selective use of glycopeptides in institutions where they do occur.",

            "text": "Approximately 20-30% of febrile patients who remain persistently neutropenic fail to respond to apparently appropriate antibiotic therapy. Some remain febrile until recovery of their neutrophil counts, irrespective of the antimicrobial therapy administered. Many patients with persistent fever will have an occult fungal infection. Patients with acute leukemia and allogeneic HSCT recipients are at highest risk due to prolonged neutropenia and immunosuppression for GVHD. Autopsy studies have shown that up to 25% of those neutropenic patients who die have an undiagnosed fungal infection. 10 In view of the difficulties in diagnosis, the use of empirical antifungal therapy has been advocated. Recent ECIL 2009 guidelines are consistent with this viewpoint and current British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) guidelines advocate empirical antifungal therapy where IFI is suspected in conjunction with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning and mycological tests (see Ch. 60). The main randomized study on which empirical antifungal therapy is based compared the effect of amphotericin (0.6 mg/kg per day or equivalent) with no treatment in patients remaining febrile 4 days after empirical therapy. 95 Although more responded in the amphotericin-treated group, the effect was only significant in patients not given antifungal prophylaxis (78% vs 45%; p = 0.04). Following this a number of other agents have been shown to be at least as effective as conventional amphotericin. Liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) is less nephrotoxic than conventional amphotericin, at least as effective in rendering patients afebrile and is associated with significantly fewer breakthrough fungal infections. 96, 97 Subsequently, caspofungin has been shown to be at least as effective as AmBisome in this setting. 97 Patients who deteriorate during the first 48 h of empirical therapy pose a particularly difficult therapeutic challenge. It is important that there are no gaps in the spectrum of the selected regimen. Deterioration may be due to Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, such as \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci, which may cause features similar to those of sepsis syndrome (including acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock), or enterococci. Gram-negative activity (including antipseudomonal activity) is essential. Consequently, the addition of an aminoglycoside to initial \u03b2-lactam monotherapy is recommended, and this is also supported by the ECIL guidelines for patients with septic shock. A glycopeptide should also be considered. The above approach is summarized in Figure 40 .2.",

In BMT recipients case fatality rates are as high as 87%. 106 Successful outcome is dependent upon early treatment and, to a considerable extent, on bone marrow recovery. Agents active against Aspergillus spp. include amphotericin deoxycholate and its lipid-associated preparations, the extended-spectrum triazoles and echinocandins. High-dose conventional amphotericin is also associated with a high incidence of nephrotoxicity. Lipidassociated formulations of the drug have been licensed for use in patients failing treatment or experiencing unacceptable toxicity with conventional amphotericin. Liposomal amphotericin (AmBisome) has been studied in a randomized prospective trial comparing two doses (1 mg/kg per day and 4 mg/kg per day) for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic patients: 109 6-month mortality was approximately 60% with attributable mortality of around 20% in the two arms. A double-blind comparison of AmBisome 3 mg/kg and AmBisome 10 mg/kg in primary therapy by Cornely and colleagues demonstrated no additional benefit of 10 mg/kg dosing over 3 mg/kg dosing of liposomal amphotericin B. 110 Voriconazole has been assessed by Denning and colleagues in two open-labeled studies in which response rates of 44% and 48% were reported, respectively. 111, 112 Superiority of voriconazole over amphotericin deoxycholate in terms of efficacy, safety and survival has been demonstrated by Herbrecht and colleagues in a randomized trial. 112 Superiority was irrespective of the host group, site of lesion or neutropenic status. Voriconazole has been given the highest graded recommendation in the recent ECIL-2 guideline update, followed by AmBisome. In North America the NCCN currently recommends voriconazole as the agent of choice for first-line therapy of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. There are insufficient data to recommend the use of caspofungin, itraconazole and posaconazole as agents in firstline therapy of invasive aspergillosis, but these have all been used in salvage therapy with similar efficacy. There are also currently insufficient data to recommend combination therapy in first-line therapy. One retrospective study 113 comparing the combination of voriconazole and caspofungin given as salvage therapy after failure of amphotericin formulations in allogeneic HSCT recipients with voriconazole monotherapy in a historical control group demonstrated substantially improved 3-month survival.",

In renal transplant recipients less than 1% develop primary toxoplasmosis. Most such cases occur within 2 months of transplant and are characterized by encephalitis, brain abscess, retinitis, pneumonitis, cardiac involvement and hepatitis. [162] [163] [164] CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS Antimicrobial prophylaxis, along with vaccination and preemptive therapy, form the mainstay of preventive strategies against infection. Until recently, most prophylactic regimens used in transplant recipients have been based on the risk of infection and likely organisms. Regimens shown to be effective in the neutropenic patient or in surgical prophylaxis have been adopted, yet few have been subject to randomized comparative trials. A short course of prophylactic antibiotics is probably appropriate to prevent wound infection related to the procedure itself. Selective decontamination of the digestive tract may be of benefit in some transplant groups, although there is conflicting evidence. Gram-negative infections are reduced in liver transplant recipients 165 but an increase in Gram-positive infections, including MRSA and VRE, has been seen in several heart transplant centers. 166 A number of studies have demonstrated the benefit of longterm prophylaxis for urinary tract infections in renal transplant recipients. Both trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (960 mg nightly) and ciprofloxacin have been effective, although the former has the additional benefit of preventing Pn. jirovecii infection. 167, 168 The issue of mycobacterial prophylaxis remains controversial and policies vary internationally. As there is a significant risk of isoniazid hepatic toxicity, this drug should be used selectively. However, this risk varies according to the transplant, from 2.5% in renal transplant recipients to 41% in liver transplant recipients. 140 Patients in whom such prophylaxis is justified are those of Asian or other high-risk ethnic origin, those with a history of tuberculosis and those with radiographic changes suggesting past chest infection.",

Therapeutic drug monitoring is mandatory (with the exception of amphotericin) to prevent additional toxicity and alternative agents should be chosen whenever possible (Table 40 .4).",

This has become increasingly important over the past decade with the advent of MRSA, VRE and other resistant organisms. Despite the development of antimicrobials with good activity against the infecting agents, the mortality from many of these infections remains high. The spectrum of immunocompromised patients is changing with the evolution of chemotherapy, stem-cell transplantation, immunosuppression regimens, and tissue and organ transplantation techniques -thus we can expect to see the pattern of opportunistic infections shift as well.

(B) Changing timeline of infection after transplantation. Infections occur in a generally predictable pattern. The development of infection is delayed by prophylaxis and accelerated by intensified immunosuppression, drug toxic effects that may cause leukopenia, or immunomodulatory viral infections such as infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). At the time of transplantation, a patient's short-term and longterm risk of infection can be stratified according to donor and recipient screening, the technical outcome of surgery, and the intensity of immunosuppression required to prevent graft rejection. Subsequently, an ongoing assessment of the risk of infection is used to adjust both prophylaxis and immunosuppressive therapy.
