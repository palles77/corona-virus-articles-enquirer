            "text": "In this paper, we present a rigorous mathematical analysis of a deterministic model for the transmission dynamics of hepatitis C. The model is suitable for populations where two frequent modes of transmission of hepatitis C virus, namely unsafe blood transfusions and intravenous drug use, are dominant. The susceptible population is divided into two distinct compartments, the intravenous drug users and individuals undergoing unsafe blood transfusions. Individuals belonging to each compartment may develop acute and then possibly chronic infections. Chronically infected individuals may be quarantined. The analysis indicates that the eradication and persistence of the disease is completely determined by the magnitude of basic reproduction number R c . It is shown that for the basic reproduction number R c \\ 1, the disease-free equilibrium is locally and globally asymptotically stable. For R c [ 1, an endemic equilibrium exists and the disease is uniformly persistent. In addition, we present the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to investigate the influence of different important model parameters on the disease prevalence. When the infected population persists, we have designed a timedependent optimal quarantine strategy to minimize it. The Pontryagin's Maximum Principle is used to characterize the optimal control in terms of an optimality system which is solved numerically. Numerical results for the optimal control are compared against the constant controls and their efficiency is discussed.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the common cause of liver diseases worldwide and a major public health problem (Bisceglie 1998) . The disease hepatitis C was first recognized in 1975 and the causative agent HCV was identified in 1989. Hepatitis C is characterized by an acute, often asymptomatic stage, followed in most cases by chronic infection that can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. HCV, which causes hepatitis C in humans, is a small, enveloped, positive-sense singlestranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae. Replication of the RNA-based virus involves the use of the enzyme RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that has a high error rate. Consequently, the virus mutates very rapidly and has no single genotype. Currently, there are seven known genotypes of HCV (Jawaid and Khuwaja 2008; Torresi et al. 2011 ). According to World Health Organization, nearly 3 % of the world population has been infected with HCV. An estimated 170 million people globally are infected with chronic HCV and are at risk of developing liver cancer/cirrhosis, while nearly 350,000 people die worldwide as a result of hepatitis C-related liver diseases each year (Waheed et al. 2009; Jiwani and Gul 2011) . Hepatitis C is characterized by an acute and a chronic stage. Initial infection by HCV results in acute hepatitis C, which is largely asymptomatic. Only about 15 % of cases display mild symptoms such as decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, muscle or joint pains, and weight loss. The infection resolves spontaneously in 20% of the cases. About 80% of the people exposed to HCV, however, eventually develop a chronic infection, thus progressing to the chronic stage of the disease. This stage can last for decades. Most people experience minimal or no symptoms during the initial few years of the infection. After several years of living with the disease hepatitis C becomes the primary cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Nearly 5-20 % of chronic hepatitis C patients develop cirrhosis over 30 years and 1-5 % die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. Those who develop cirrhosis have a 20-fold greater risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, a rate of 13 % per year. It is estimated that hepatitis C is the cause of 27 % of cirrhosis cases and 25 % of hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide (Bisceglie et al. 1991; Fattovich 1997; Kiyosawa 1990; Hutin 2004) .",

The response to treatment also varies by genotype and ranges from 70-80 % for genotypes 2 and 3 to almost non-existent for genotype 6. Also, recent treatment advances of genotype 1 infection using directly acting antiviral agents are encouraging; there is still a need to develop an effective vaccination strategy capable of preventing infection. The vaccines used in clinical and preclinical trials include recombinant proteins, DNA-based proteins, synthetic peptide vaccines, etc. The implementation and success of the above-mentioned vaccines along with future designs of vaccine strategies have been discussed in detail by Toressi et al. (2011) . Furthermore, the high cost of the therapy results in low clinical usage. In USA, the median HCV health care expenditure of Interferon therapy exceeds $2470 (Armstrong and Charland 2004) . Recovery from infection with HCV does not result in longterm immunity. Therefore, any model for hepatitis C must reflect this lack of acquired immunity by allowing recovered individuals to become susceptible again. HCV is primarily spread by blood-to-blood contact through blood transfusions, the use of poorly sterilized medical equipment and intravenous drug use (IDU). Screening at blood transfusion has resulted in a significant decline in HCV transmission, especially in the developed world. However there are countries lacking resources where screening costs have posed a hinderance to blood screening for HCV (Alter 2007) . The primary route of transmission in the developed world is IDU, while in the developing world HCV is predominantly spread through unsafe blood transfusions and therapeutic procedures (Maheshwari and Thuluvath 2009 ). The HCV prevalence among IDUs is greater than HIV [67, 72.5 and 73 .4 % among the IDUs in China, Russia and the USA, respectively (Nelson et al. 2011) ]. The World Health Organization declares IDUs as an important target group for HCV treatment and prevention (Nelson et al. 2011) . Among IDUs in USA and Europe, transmissions occur via sharing injection equipments such as syringes, needles and other paraphernalia (Mathei et al. 2006) . Both modes of HCV transmission (unsafe blood transfusion and IDUs) are significant for certain communities [studies indicate prevalence percentages of 48.67 \u00b1 1.75 % and 57 \u00b1 17.7 %, respectively, in Pakistan (Waheed et al. 2009 ) see also Ali et al. (2009)] .",

Most of these papers classify individuals in the population into different states and then formulate a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) to analyze the time evolution of each of these population states. Reade et al. (1998) has discussed an ODE model of infections with acute and chronic stages. Similarly, Luo and Xiang (2012) analyzed a four state system with exposed, acute and chronic states. Suna et al. (2012) has analyzed an SEIRS model where it was assumed that recovered individuals lose their infectionacquired immunity. Martcheva and Castillo-Chavez (2003) have formulated a model for hepatitis C lacking an exposed class and have discussed the stability of the equilibrium states. Dontwi et al. (2010) considered the transmission of hepatitis C through IDUs in an acute, chronic and recovered model. Other deterministic models pertinent to our work have also been proposed and analysed (Busenberg and Hadeler (1990); Esteva and Vargas (1999); Hadeler and Castillo-Chavez (1995) ; Hethcote and Thieme (1985) ; and Hethcote et al.

            "text": "We present a deterministic model with two distinct susceptible population groups comprising IDUs and those getting blood transfusion (unsafe needles in healthcare setting etc.), respectively. So we are considering the transmission of hepatitis C among these two population groups (representing two distinctive modes of transmission). Individuals in each group are classified as susceptible, acute, chronic, quarantined and recovered. The acute and chronic states represent the individuals in the acute and chronic stage of the infections, respectively. The quarantine state represents the chronically infected individuals getting quarantined. The isolation of those with disease symptoms is among the first infection control measures ever recorded (Hethcote 2000) . Over the course of time, quarantine strategy has been used to combat the spread of many emerging and re-emerging human diseases such as leprosy, plague, cholera, typhus, yellow fever, smallpox, diphtheria, tuberculosis, measles, Ebola, pandemic influenza and, more recently, SARS (Chowell et al. 2004; Yan et al. 2007; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2003) . Luo and Xiang (2012) has performed a global analysis of a four-state 'susceptible', 'exposed', 'acute' and 'chronic' model and proven certain theorems regarding the stability of the steady states of the model. However, almost no analysis of the effects of a quarantine class on a disease with a chronic stage has been done and therefore, our paper will be one of the first attempts to study the effect of quarantine (education campaigns, self quarantine etc.) on the spread of a disease with a chronic stage. It should be pointed out that quarantine or isolation here is not being considered in the traditional sense. Quarantine involves only the isolation of individuals who have been exposed to the disease. Since hepatitis C is largely asymptomatic, and chronically infected individuals can live for years without being identified, a quarantine class can be used to consider individuals who have been clearly identified as being infected with HCV. Such individuals can then undergo treatment for HCV and take extra precautions while interacting with the people around them (self quarantine). The notion of quarantine introduced also includes the educational campaigns to spread awareness about HCV, its transmission modes and how to proceed if infection is identified, free supply of needle to intravenous drug users. Such quarantine strategy can potentially play a significant role in hepatitis C control by decreasing the effective contact rate.",

Susceptible drug user individuals who get infected Theory Biosci. (2014) 133:91-109 93 suffer from the acute form of hepatitis C and move to the compartment A 1 with the force of infection given by k 1 . Individuals in A 1 , in addition to the natural death rate l, die at a disease-induced death rate d a . They also have a natural recovery rate of j 1 . Individuals with the acute form of the infection progress to the chronic form of the disease at a rate n 1 , in which case the individual is shifted to compartment C 1 . Individuals in C 1 , in addition to the natural death rate l, also die at a disease-induced death rate d c . Furthermore, these individuals recover at a rate w 1 and thus move to the recovered compartment R 1 . Also, the individuals in compartment C 1 are quarantined and moved to compartment Q 1 at a rate a 1 . Individuals in Q 1 , in addition to the natural death rate l, also die at a disease-induced death rate d q . Quarantined individuals can either become susceptible once more at a rate c 1 f 1 or regress to become acutely infected with HCV at a rate c 1 (1f 1 ). Recovery from HCV does not result in long-term immunity. Therefore, recovered patients in R become susceptible at a rate x 1 . Also the infected individual from one group can infect the individual from the same group as well as the individuals from other group and vice versa. This aspect has been captured in the force of infections k 1 and k 2 . However the relative ability to infect the other group might be different and this will be discussed as the analysis is carried out later (Table 1) . Mathematically, the model is as follows:",

Joshi (2002) formulated two control functions as coefficients of the ODE system representing treatment effects in a two drug regime in an HIV immunology model. The goal was to maximize the concentration of T cells while minimizing the toxic effects of the drug. The analytic and numerical results illustrated the level of two drugs to be used over the chosen time interval. The required bal- Fig. 6 Plots of the basic reproduction number R 0 with respect to infected being quarantined rate a 1 and effective contact rate b 1 ; a a contour plot of the surface R 0 , showing higher quarantine rate a 1 will reduce R 0 . b Surface plot of R 0 , higher quarantine rate a 1 and low contact rate b 1 will keep R 0 \\ 1 ancing effect between two competing goals was well predicted by optimal control theory. Behncke (2000) studied SIR models including vaccination, quarantine and health promotion campaign and obtained analytical results for optimal control. The optimal control intervention policies for stochastic epidemic models were treated by Clancy (1999) . Pontryagin's Maximum Principle appends an adjoint system of differential equations with terminal boundary conditions, to the original model (state system) of differential equations, in the attempt to characterize an optimal control. The optimality system, which characterizes the optimal controls, consists of the differential equations of the original model (state system) along with the adjoint differential equations (adjoint system). The number of equations in the adjoint system is same as that of the state system. The adjoint functions behave very similar to the Lagrange multipliers (appending constraints to the function of several variables to be maximized or minimized). The adjoint variables maximize or minimize the state variables with respect to the desired objective functional. The details of the necessary conditions for the adjoint and optimal controls are presented in Pontryagin and Boltyanskii (1986) , Fleming and Rishel (1975) . For the application of these results see the work of Fister et al. (1998) .",

The isolation of those with disease symptoms, constitute what is probably the first infection control measure since the beginning of recorded human history (Hethcote 2000) . Over the decades, quarantine has been used to reduce the transmission of numerous emerging and re-emerging human diseases such as leprosy, plague, cholera, typhus, yellow fever, smallpox, diphtheria, tuberculosis, measles, ebola, pandemic influenza and, more recently, SARS. In our model of HCV, the quarantine compartment was introduced to investigate the effect on the infected population size and results were discussed in the last section. Now we attempt to control the quarantine rate of the chronically infected individuals to control the HCV transmission. This section will explore the effects of quarantine control rate, of chronically infected individuals, on the total size of the infected population. In addition to the dynamics of the original model (1), the quarantine rates labeled as a 1 and a 2 will now be considered as time dependent control parameters. Let this model, with time-dependent control parameters, be labeled as (4.1). Yan et al. (2007) discuss the application of optimal and sub-optimal control for SARS outbreak, a pair of control parameters were introduced representing quarantine and isolation strategies. The use of quarantine and isolation control has also been studied by Zou (2008, 2009) . The cost of the quarantine facility will strongly influence the policy and we have to consider it in our analysis. Now we design an optimal control strategy to minimize an objective functional that takes into account both the cost and the number of infectious individuals.

The parameter values are used from Table 2 and the initial conditions are given in the ''Appendix''. The parameter values used have R c [ 1 when the model without time dependent control is considered. Thus, the disease is not expected to die out without intervention strategies. Figure 7 represents the optimal quarantine strategy to be employed to minimize the cost and the infected population. Considering the practical constraints, an upper bound of 0.5 was chosen for the optimal quarantine control pair (a 1 (t), a 2 (t)).The optimal control a 1 is at its upper bound value at the start of time before reaching the minimum value at a slower rate. On the other hand, a 2 is at the maximum value initially and then it sharply decreases before getting to the minimum value of 0. In fact, at the beginning of simulated time, the optimal controls are staying at the upper bound to quarantine as many chronically infected individuals as possible to prevent the infected population from increasing. The steadily decreasing of the control pairs is determined by the balance between the cost of the infected individuals and the cost of the control facilities. Also the assumption of h 21 = 0 appears to be reasonable as a positive value of h 21 does not change the optimal control strategy. Figure 8a shows the total infected population for the optimal control and constant control l. It is clear that with the use of an optimal control strategy disease epidemic can be prevented and disease remains under control at all times. Figure 9 shows the cost associated with the optimal and constant control strategy. It is clear the costs of optimal strategy are much less than the cost of relatively low (but practically feasible) constant control and in fact differ by order of magnitude of tens. It is important to note that high constant quarantine rate (a 1 ,a 2 = 0.4) incurs almost the same cost as of optimal control. However, practically it is highly unlikely to implement these high constant controls primarily due to the lack of required resources and facilities. Figure 10 captures the effect of change in effective contact rate over the optimal control strategy. It is clear from the simulation that an increase in the contact rate will lead to higher rates of quarantine. This result is in line with the sensitivity analysis where it was shown that contact rate b 1 have a positive correlation with R c (which determines the disease prevalence). ",

Given the nature of the disease, controlling quarantine parameter (i.e. devising an effective quarantine strategy) seems to the most workable solution; 3.

Using techniques from optimal control theory we concluded that Fig. 10 Optimal control: simulation presents the change in the optimal quarantine strategy as the effective contact rate is changed for intravenous drug users and for blood transfusion group 1. An optimal control (rather than a high constant control) is preferable, where quarantining rate of chronically infected individuals is a function of time.",

However, it should be pointed out that the ideal timevarying optimal strategy might not be applied easily. Still, it does provide a basis on which to design practical quasi-optimal control strategies There are several directions in which to extend the present work, we outline some of these here. In our analysis we took the modification parameter for cross infectiousness, h 21 = 0, this was justified as the numerics showed no qualitative difference between the zero and non-zero h 21 case. It would be interesting to analytically verify this numerical observation. We considered two modes of transmission of the disease, one can also look at a third important mode of transmission, the spread of virus via facilities such as the dentists or barber shops. Finally an interesting extension of this work would be looking at a Markov Chain based stochastic model, involving the two transmission pathways.",

Natural death rate is chosen so that 1 l corresponds to the 60 9 12 (average life span in months). Drug users interact much more frequently than those undergoing blood transfusion (needles in healthcare setting). Therefore, the effective contact rate b = 0.3 is higher for drug users than the rest b 2 = 0.2. We assumes that there is 1 in a 3 chance to get infected while interacting with intravenous drug users compared to 1 in a 5 chance to catch the infection while undergoing blood transfusion or reuse of needles in healthcare setting. Among IDU's, a high percentage can be drug addicts and so the quarantine recovery time will be greater compared to the other half of infected population. Considering this we have assumed c 1 and c 2 such that the recovery time ( 1 c 1 ; 1 c 2 ) is around 36 and 24 months, respectively. It is well known and documented that the progression from acute to chronic infection takes 6 months time and so the progression rate n 1;2 \u00bc 2 12 is chosen accordingly. Quarantine of the IDU's will serve well both for their chronic infection and the drug habits.Also the IDU's are easier to identify, therefore their quarantine rate is assumed to be higher. The infectiousness of acute infection is higher than chronic infection (Corson et al. 2013; Zhang and Zhou 2012) . Hence a reasonable estimates of g 1,2 . The mean values of the parameters are taken from gamma distribution, respectively. Standard deviations have been assumed to be 1-5 %. The distributions are assumed considering the type and nature of each of the parameter and unfortunately there is no extensive study and data available to support this set of choice. Individuals who have been identified with chronic infection carries are equally likely to get quarantined and so we used a uniform distribution for a. Mostly parameters (b, g etc.) are supposed to be skewed towards a certain value, therefore we have used gamma distribution for them. Parameters depending on natural causes (natural death rate l, natural recovery rate j etc.) have been assigned normal distributions.
