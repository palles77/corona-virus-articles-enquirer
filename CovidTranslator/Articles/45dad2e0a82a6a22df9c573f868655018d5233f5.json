To improve public health surveillance and, ultimately, interventions, we examined 3 primary systems that process event-based outbreak information: Global Public Health Intelligence Network, HealthMap, and EpiSPIDER. Despite similarities among them, these systems are highly complementary because they monitor different data types, rely on varying levels of automation and human analysis, and distribute distinct information. Future development should focus on linking these systems more closely to public health practitioners in the fi eld and establishing collaborative networks for alert verifi cation and dissemination. Such development would further establish event-based monitoring as an invaluable public health resource that provides critical context and an alternative to traditional indicator-based outbreak reporting.",

Offi cials now need to consider worldwide disease outbreaks when determining what potential threats might affect the health and welfare of their nations (4) . In industrialized countries, unprecedented efforts have built on indicator-based public health surveillance, and monitoring of clinically relevant data sources now provides early indication of outbreaks (5) . In many countries where public health infrastructure is rudimentary, deteriorating, or nonexistent, efforts to improve the ability to conduct electronic disease surveillance include more robust data collection methods and enhanced analysis capability (6, 7) . However, in these parts of the world, basing timely and sensitive reporting of public health threats on conventional surveillance sources remains challenging. Lack of resources and trained public health professionals poses a substantial roadblock (8) (9) (10) . Furthermore, reporting emerging infectious diseases has certain constraints, including fear of repercussions on trade and tourism, delays in clearance through multiple levels of government, tendency to err on the conservative side, and inadequately functioning or nonexistent surveillance infrastructure (11) . Even with the recent enactment of international health regulations in 2005, no guarantee yet exists that broad compliance will be feasible, given the challenges associated with reporting mechanisms and multilateral coordination (12) .",

Our report is the result of a joint symposium from the American Medical Informatics Association Annual Conference in 2007. Despite key differences, all 3 systems face similar technologic challenges, including 1) topic detection and data acquisition from a high-volume stream of event reports (not all related to disease outbreaks); 2) data characterization, categorization, or information extraction; 3) information formatting and integration with other sources; and 4) information dissemination to clients or, more broadly, to the public.",

In 1997, a prototype GPHIN system was developed in a partnership between the government of Canada and WHO. The objective was to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of using news media sources to continuously gather information about possible disease outbreaks worldwide and to rapidly alert international bodies of such events. The sources included websites, news wires, and local and national newspapers retrieved through news aggregators in English and French. After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a new, robust, multilingual GPHIN system was developed and was launched November 17, 2004 , at the United Nations.",

Through this multistream approach, HealthMap casts a unifi ed and comprehensive view of global infectious disease outbreaks in space and time. Fully automated, the system acquires data every hour and uses text mining to characterize the data to determine the disease category and location of the outbreak. Alerts, defi ned as information on a previously unidentifi ed outbreak, are geocoded to the country scale with province-, state-, or city-level resolution for select countries.

Although information relating to infectious disease outbreaks is collected, not all information has relevance to every user. The system designers are especially concerned with limiting information overload and providing focused news of immediate interest. Thus, after a fi rst categorization step into locations and diseases, a second round of category tags is applied to the articles to improve fi ltering. The primary tags include 1) breaking news (e.g., a newly discovered outbreak); 2) warning (initial concerns of disease emergence, e.g., in a natural disaster area; 3) follow-up (reference to a past outbreak); 4) background/context (information on disease context, e.g., preparedness planning); and 5) not disease-related (information not relating to any disease [2-5 are fi ltered from display]). Duplicate reports are also removed by calculating a similarity score based on text and category matching. Finally, in addition to providing mapped content, each alert is linked to a related information window with details on reports of similar content as well as recent reports concerning either the same disease or location and links for further research (e.g., WHO, CDC, and PubMED).",

Their strategy is to rely on companies that sell the service of collecting event information from every pertinent news stream. In contrast, HealthMap's strategy is to rely on open-access news aggregators (e.g., GoogleNews and Moreover) and curated sources (e.g., ProMED and EuroSurveillance). EpiSPIDER, until recently, has concentrated on curated sources only (e.g., ProMED, GDACS, and CIA Factbook). This distinction between free and paid sources raises the question of whether the systems have access to the same event information.",

            "text": "After the data sources have been chosen, the next step is to extract useful information among the incoming reports. First, at the level of the report stream, the system must fi lter out reports that are not disease related and categorize the remaining (disease-related) reports into predefi ned sets. Then, at a second level of triage, the information within each retrieved alert (e.g., an event's location or reported disease) is assessed. GPHIN does this data characterization through automatic processing and human analysis, whereas HealthMap and EpiSPIDER rely mainly on automated techniques (although a person per- forms a daily scan of all HealthMap alerts and a sample of EpiSpider alerts). After a report in the data stream is determined to be relevant, it is processed for dissemination. GPHIN automatically translates the reports into different languages and grants its clients access to the database through a custom search engine. GPHIN also decides which reports should be raised to the status of alerts and sent to its clients by email. HealthMap provides a geographic and temporal panorama of ongoing epidemics through an open-access user interface. It automatically fi lters out the reports that do not correspond to breaking alerts. The remaining alerts are prepared for display (time codes and geocodes as well as disease category and data source) to allow faceted browsing and are linked to other information sources (e.g., the Wikipedia defi nition of the disease). These data are also provided as daily email digests to users interested in specifi c diseases and locations. Although GPHIN and Health-Map provide their own user interface, EpiSPIDER explores conventional formats for reports, adding time-coding, geocoding, and country metadata for automatic integration with other information sources and versatile browsing by using existing open-source software. These reports are displayed under the name of Web Exhibits and include, for example, a mapping and a timeline view of the reports and a scatter plot of the alerts with respect to the originating country's human development index and gross domestic product per capita.",

These differences also raise the question of whether information from one system is more reliable than that of the others. Undertaking an evaluation of the systems in parallel is a critical next step. Also, all 3 systems are inherently prone to noise because most of the data sources they use or plan to use (Figure) for surveillance are not verifi ed by public health professionals, so even if the system is supervised by a human analyst, it might still generate false alerts. False alerts need to be mitigated because they might have substantial undue economic and social consequences. Eventbased disease surveillance may also benefi t from algorithms linked by ontology (formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts) detecting precursors of disease events. Measurement and handling of input data's reliability is a critical research direction.",
