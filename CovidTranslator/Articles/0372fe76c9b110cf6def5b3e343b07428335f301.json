The syndrome is defined as abnormal pulmonary physiology with multilobar opacities on chest imaging that are not attributable to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) or other organ failures [1] . Many pathologies meet IPS criteria, including organizing pneumonia, interstitial pneumonitis, and diffuse alveolar damage, among others. Biologic heterogeneity within this broadly defined syndrome may diminish the ability to detect the effect of treatments. An improved understanding of IPS pathobiology may catalyze the development of effective preventive and therapeutic strategies [2] .",

As a preliminary examination of this concept, we tested the hypothesis that immuno-inflammatory mediators measured in the blood and alveolar compartments of people with IPS differ according to the presence or absence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). DAH is a variably present manifestation of IPS that is proposed to have distinct biology [5] . We retrospectively studied 17 adults who underwent clinical bronchoscopy for diffusely abnormal chest imaging within 120 days of allogeneic HCT at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) between 2008 and 2010. None received specific tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 inhibitors prior to bronchoscopy.

BALF samples were obtained using standard clinical techniques and cryopresevered without processing. We thawed samples on an ice batch and centrifuged them at 1000\u00d7g for 10 min to remove debris. We then batchanalyzed in duplicate a broad array of immunoinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors using commercially available multiplexed immunoassay kits per manufacturer guidelines (Meso Scale Diag-nostics\u2122, Rockville, MD).

Both preclinical and clinical studies have contributed importantly to the current understanding of IPS. Reassuringly, our results are similar to those found in experimental models and clinical settings. Panoskaltsis-Mortari et al. examined lung protein extracts, serum, and BALF from a murine IPS model exposed to cyclophosphamide, total body irradiation, allogeneic HCT, and natural killer (NK)-cell depleted spleen cell infusion (a T-cell source) [11] . This study demonstrated time-varying elevations in MIP-1\u03b1 and MCP-1 messenger RNA expression and protein production in all compartments relative to healthy controls. In another preclinical study, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, and MCP-1 were expressed early after irradiated mice received allogeneic bone marrow transplants [12] . Experimental disruption of either MCP-1 or its receptor lowered BALF monocyte, macrophage, and in the latter case, T-cell counts and lessened histopathologic lung injury. Clinical studies demonstrate that MCP-1 levels are elevated in BALF collected from people with IPS relative to healthy controls and individuals with chronic noninfectious lung disease after HCT [4, 12] . In one observational study, BALF sampled before and after TNF-\u03b1 antagonist therapy demonstrated decreases in MCP-1 and other inflammatory mediators in the subset of subjects who experienced clinical improvement [4] . Our study extends these findings by suggesting that IPS subtypes may have different inflammatory profiles and therefore differing response to immunomodulatory therapies. A recent study applied modern molecular diagnostic techniques to BALF samples from individuals previously diagnosed with IPS and found occult viruses of unknown clinical significance [13] . In a post hoc analysis, we examined the distribution of the most prevalent occult virus known to be a human pathogen, HHV-6, using a real-time quantitative fluorescent probe PCR assay as previously described [14, 15] . Eight of the 17 study subjects were HHV-6 positive. HHV-6 was similarly distributed between subjects with and without IPS and between subjects with IPS and DAH and subjects with non-DAH IPS. BALF and plasma cytokine levels did not differ between IPS cases with HHV-6 and IPS cases without HHV-6 (data not shown). Although it is possible that the current IPS definition misclassifies some infections, HHV-6 did not clearly drive the findings of our study. Future research must consider the potential role of \"occult\" viral infection when defining IPS subphenotypes.",

The lack of standard methods to correct for dilution of BALF may introduce error. The impacts of therapeutic corticosteroids, the cryopreservation of unprocessed BALF, and variable timing of sample collection on our results are unknown. The onset of non-DAH IPS occurred later than IPS with DAH and more often after engraftment. In this study, DAH may be a surrogate for important biologic differences between early-and lateronset IPS. Alternatively, the differences we found may relate to time passing instead of varied biology. A confirmatory prospective validation study is needed that ideally collects and processes plasma and BALF simultaneously. Analysis of protein levels, leukocyte expression, and cellular profiles may help elucidate important biologic differences between IPS subtypes.",

The heterogeneous nature of the current IPS definition may not allow research to reveal the true effects of immune modulating therapies.
