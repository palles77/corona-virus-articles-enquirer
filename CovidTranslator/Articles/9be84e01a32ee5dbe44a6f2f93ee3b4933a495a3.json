Multiplex nucleic acid tests (NATs) have begun to replace conventional methods as gold standards for respiratory virus detection. Objective: To compare the performance of two large multiplex NATS, ResPlex II (RPII) and Respiratory Virus Surveillance kit with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RVS/MS) using nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from hospitalized children who had been tested previously with conventional methods. Study design: Stored residual NPAs (N = 306) were tested concomitantly by RPII and RVS/MS. Alternate NATs were used to adjudicate discordant results. Results: More viruses were detected with multiplex NATs (RPII, 110; RVS/MS, 109) than conventional assays (86); diagnostic gain was primarily for fastidious viruses (coronaviruses and enteroviruses [EVs]/human rhinoviruses [HRVs]). Total positive and negative agreement between the multiplex NATs for all viruses detected was quite high (86% positive agreement, 99% negative agreement). Most individual viruses were detected with fairly equivalent accuracy by the multiplex NATs, except for adenoviruses (RPII sensitivity 40%) and human metapneumovirus (RVS/MS sensitivity 42%). RPII had the advantage of detecting EVs and HRVs, however, it demonstrated considerable EV/HRV cross-reactivity (29 HRVpositive specimens by real-time PCR were positive for EV by RPII and 21 specimens positive for HRV only by RT-PCR were dual positive for EV/HRV by RPII). RPII also had reduced sensitivity for HRV detection (in 36 specimens, HRV was detected by RT-PCR but not by RPII). Conclusions: Both multiplex NATs were promising, but had notable limitations.",

Signal detection/raw data analysis Signals were detected with the Luminex 200 IS System using QIAplex MDD Software. In-house determination of the cutoff value that could be applied to distinguish positive results was required since software lacks this interpretive criterion. Four different cut-off values were studied including 3\u00d7 background (bkgd), \u226550, \u2265100, or \u2265150 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values. For 3\u00d7 background calculation, the negative control MFI for each assay was multiplied by three and used as the cutoff to define positive samples within that run. To decide which cut-off value was most appropriate, the results obtained with each cutoff were compared to RVS/MS, discrepant analysis with alternate PCR assays, and conventional test results. Two cutoffs, \u2265100 MFI and 3\u00d7 bkgd MFI, showed the best correlation with aggregate data from other test methods. The 3\u00d7 bkgd cut-off was selected because it demonstrated excellent overall agreement with the other methods and it allowed inter-run data normalization by accounting for runto-run variability in background fluorescence. For the purposes of this study, RSV A and B were not differentiated and bocavirus was not included in the analysis since its importance as a respiratory pathogen has not been firmly established.",

Deep multiplexing also has the important advantage of allowing identification of not only the usual pathogens (RSV, INF A, ADVs) but also unsuspected, typically lower virulence viruses (PIVs, HRVs, CoVs) that can cause lower respiratory tract disease and can therefore be significantly pathogenic in highly susceptible hosts. In this performance comparison study on samples from hospitalized children, the highly multiplexed RPII and RVS/MS assays detected most viruses with fairly equivalent accuracy. The exceptions to this were hMPV and ADV which were more effectively detected by RPII and RVS/MS respectively. A low ADV detection rate by RPII compared to a different extensively multiplexed respiratory virus NAT (Seeplex) has been previously reported. 9 Independent published confirmation of low hMPV detection rates by RVS/MS compared to an alternate NAT are lacking. Given that ADV and hMPV are highly prevalent and can cause serious disease, these potential diagnostic shortcomings are significant and represent opportunities for performance enhancement in subsequent generations of these assays. Unfortunately the prevalence of PIVs was too low to make any definitive conclusions regarding the relative efficacy of RPII and RVS/MS. It should also be noted that the study design precludes conclusions regarding true (vs. relative) accuracy and sensitivity. Therefore, while the accuracy of detection for most viruses was comparable and quite high, testing with gold standard NATs for each analyte might reveal additional detection deficiencies common to RPII and RVS/MS.",

RPII provides better diagnostic potential than the current version of RVS/MS since it can detect EV/HRV. In fact, in this study, the prevalence of EV/HRV was highest of all viruses (\u223c37%, including RPII and RT-PCR positives). However, RPII has limitations with regard to EV/HRV detection. First, the data suggest cross-reactivity between RPII EV and HRV detection reagents as suggested by previous studies that noted discordant EV/HRV results in a limited number of samples 10 and a high proportion of EV/HRV dual positives. 9 Our data imply that crossreactivity is more extensive than previously appreciated given the number of discordant (RPII EV+/RT-PCR HRV+) and RPII dual+/RT-PCR HRV only specimens.",

On a qualitative basis, these results would appear to suggest false positive HRV RT-PCR results. However signal strength data point to a different conclusion. The low mean and median HRV RT-PCR Ct values suggest that most of these samples likely contained HRV only, further implying issues with EV detection specificity (by RPII and RT-PCR) and sensitivity of HRV detection (by RPII). Published data 6 and our unpublished observations with the EV RT-PCR reagents suggest a propensity for cross-reactivity. An internal study of EV and HRV RT-PCR reagents demonstrated HRV in 69/507 NPAs; 4/69 were also amplified by EV RT-PCR. VP1 sequence data was obtainable from 1/4 samples and demonstrated HRV. HRV RT-PCR specificity should be much greater than EV RT-PCR; the latter was developed by comparative analysis of a more extensive sequence library compared to EV RT-PCR and was shown to cross-amplify EV only in artificial samples spiked with high concentrations of synthetic transcripts. 7 Improved EV/HRV concordance between RPII and RT-PCR was observed when positive results were grouped (EV/HRV unspecified), which may be the most accurate approach for reporting RPII results. However even with grouped reporting, it was apparent that RPII missed approximately one third of infections detected by singleplex RT-PCR. A similar defect in EV/HRV detection compared to an alternate NAT has been reported. 10 Subsequent versions of this assay would benefit from improved HRV sensitivity given reports of HRV causing clinically significant disease. 11, 12 Few co-infections with viruses other than EV/HRV were observed. Strikingly, all confirmed non-EV/HRV co-infections included HKU-1 as a co-pathogen. The biological significance of this is unclear; no data are available in the literature. Among EV/HRV coinfections, no dominant non-enteroviral pathogen was observed. The identified viruses reflect the spectrum commonly observed in young children.",
