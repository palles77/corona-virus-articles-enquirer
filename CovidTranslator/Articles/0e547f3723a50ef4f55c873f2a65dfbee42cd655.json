We tested increasing the delta value between virus and host nucleic acids. The optimal combination was found to be 30% of sucrose, 2 h of centrifugation at 15,000 rpm or 35,000 rpm. Results of quadratic loss functions and signal-to-noise ratios are available on request. The second ultracentrifugation provided useful results. The optimal parameters (2 ultracentrifugations) were supported by a confirmation experiment and were subsequently used as part of the protocol ( Figure 5 of main text).",

            "text": "Tissue was homogenized by using a FastPrep Homogenizer (MP Biomedicals) for 60 s (3 cycles for 20 s at full speed and cooled on ice between cycles) and 120 sec (2 cycles). For enzymatic digestion, 1 aliquot was incubated with 150 \u00b5L of trypsin/EDTA (GIBCO Life Technologies, Darmstadt Germany) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. Ultrasonic homogenization was performed by using the SONOPLUS Ultrasound Homogenizer (Bandelin Electronic, Berlin, Germany) in 3 intervals of 1 min in a pulse mode of 5 \u00d7 10% with 1 impulse of 1 s divided into a 0.5-s pulse and 0.5-s pause. A Dounce Homogenizer (Kleinfeld Labortechnik, Gehrden, Germany) was used as described according to the manufacturer's instructions. A Qiashredder (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was Page 3 of 7 used according to the manufacturer's protocol and included 1 centrifugation step at 11,000 rpm for 2 min in a bench-top centrifuge. Only extended homogenization with the FastPrep Homogenizer resulted in slightly increased virus detectability. Thus, we used the extended homogenization time in the final protocol. Results of the compared homogenization steps are shown in Figure 3 of main text. Filtration A total of 200 \u00b5L of homogenized tissue was filtered by using syringe filters (diameters 0.22 \u03bcm and 0.45 \u03bcm; Millipore, Cork, Ireland). Fractionated filtration was accomplished by using 0.22-\u03bcm and subsequently 0.45-\u03bcm syringe filters. Subsequently, used filters were incubated with PBS and extracted to identify possible virus residues. Tissue was also filtered by using low-binding 0.22-\u03bcm Durapore polyvinylidene fluoride membrane filter tubes (Millipore). Filtration of tissues resulted in a decreased detectability or deterioration of the ratio between virus and host DNA/RNA. Only a 0.22-\u00b5m filter or filter centrifugation tube was able to increase that ratio slightly (Figure 4 of main text). Digestion DNA and RNA derived from the host can be digested with different enzymes, whereas nucleic acids inside intact virus particles should be protected by the virus capsid. Enzymatic digestion of the samples with the enzymes Benzonase (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and RNase A (QIAGEN) and the Turbo DNA-Free Kit (Ambion, Darmstadt, Germany) were tested in 9 experiments according to the procedures of Taguchi (3) and Cobb and Clarkson (4) Control factors were centrifugation before digestion (30,000 rpm in an ultracentrifuge, 1,000 rpm in a bench-top centrifuge, and no centrifugation); combination of enzymes (Benzonase/RNase/DNase, Benzonase/RNase, and only Benzonase); incubation time (30 min, 60 min, 180 min); and inactivation of the enzyme after the digestion (without inactivation, inactivation with special enzyme inhibitors, and centrifugation at 1,500 rpm). Results of quadratic loss functions are available on request. Optimal conditions for digestion of nucleic acids were calculated by using the method of Taguchi (3) (30 min at 37\u00b0C, DNase only, centrifugation, and inactivation) and subsequent confirmed in another experiment. This digestion method was included into the tissue-based universal virus detection for viral metagenomics (TUViD-VM) protocol.",
