J. Virol. 78,[3572][3573][3574][3575][3576][3577]. Ribavirin given at 75 mg/kg 4 h prior to virus exposure and then given twice daily for 3 days beginning at day 0 was found to increase virus lung titers and extend the length of time that virus could be detected in the lungs of mice. Other IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors administered near maximum tolerated doses using the same dosing regimen as for ribavirin were found to slightly enhance virus replication in the lungs. In addition, ribavirin treatment seemed also to promote the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 4 days after cessation of treatment, although after 3 days of treatment ribavirin inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine production in infected mice, significantly reducing the levels of the cytokines IL-1\u2423, interleukin-5 (IL-5), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). These findings suggest that ribavirin may actually contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV by prolonging and/or enhancing viral replication in the lungs. By not inhibiting viral replication in the lungs of infected mice, ribavirin treatment may have provided a continual source of stimulation for the inflammatory response thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of the infection. Our data do not support the use of ribavirin or other IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors for treating SARS infections in humans.",

Initial studies by Cinatl et al. (2003a,b) suggested that ribavirin did not inhibit SARS-CoV replication in African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) at therapeutically achievable concentrations. This was subsequently confirmed in several laboratories (Barnard et al., 2004b; Str\u00f6her et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2004) . More than likely ribavirin was not phosphorylated to sufficient levels in Vero cells to achieve an antiviral effect . However, others have found that ribavirin was a potent inhibitor of viral replication in Vero cells (Yamamoto et al., 2004) . In addition, ribavirin apparently inhibited SARS-CoV replication in rhesus monkey kidney cells (FRhK-4) at 50 g/ml. However, the clinically equivalent concentration of this dose would be above plasma levels achievable in humans (Koren et al., 2003) . Morgenstern et al. (2005) have found ribavirin to be efficacious against SARS-CoV in several other cells lines including embryonic African green monkey kidney cells (MA-104), pig kidney cells (PK-15), and human colon carcinoma cell lines .",

In infected mice (group-2), the levels of IL-1\u2423 (p < 0.0001), IL-1\u2424 (p = 0.05), IL-6 (p = 0.04), IFN-\u2425 (p = 0.03), TNF-\u2423, GM-CSF, and RANTES (almost two-fold) were greater than two-fold above those found in uninfected, untreated mice (group-1). Ribavirin treatment of infected mice (group-4) on day 3 seemed to ameliorate the induction of the cytokine storm by virus infection, since levels of IL-\u2423 (p = 0.02), IL-5 (p = 0.006), MCP-1 (p = 0.04), and GM-CSF (p = 0.02) were significantly higher in the ribavirin-treated animals (group-4) when compared to virus-infected animals (group-2). Ribavirin treatment of uninfected mice (group-3) seemed not to perturb the cytokine response compared to the placebo-treated, uninfected mice (group-1). Levels of cytokines in ribavirin-treated, infected mice (group-4) were somewhat similar to cytokine levels in uninfected, untreated mice (group-1), although the levels of IL-1\u2423 (p = 0.002), IL-6 (p = 0.003), IL-12 (p = 0.05), MCP-1 (p = 0.02), and IFN-\u2425 (p = 0.014) were still significantly higher in the ribavirin-treated, infected mice (group-4).",

Cytokine levels in virus-infected mice (group-6) which were still significantly increased compared to control animals (group-5) were IL-2 (p = 0.009), IL-6 (p = 0.05), IL-10 (p = 0.04), IL-12 (p = 0.01), MCP-1 (p = 0.04), IFN-\u2425 (p < 0.0001), TNF-\u2423 (p = 0.01), and GM-CSF (p = 0.05) ( Table 6 ). Other cytokines were also increased as well, including IL-1\u2423 and IL-1\u2424, IL-5, IL-9, MIP-1\u2423, and RANTES. At day 7 in infected mice treated with ribavirin (group-8), IL-1\u2423 (p = 0.03), IL-4 (p = 0.04), IL-6 (p = 0.04), IL-12 (p = 0.01), IFN-\u2425 (p = 0.007), and TNF-\u2423 (p = 0.01) were still elevated in infected mice when compared to the untreated, uninfected animals (group-5). When the cytokines levels of the ribavirintreated, infected animals (group-8) were compared to those of the virus-infected animals (group-6), only the levels of IFN-\u2425 (0.03) were significantly lower on the ribavirin-treated, infected animals; the remaining cytokines levels were similar in both groups. For these three groups of mice, cytokine levels of IL-6 (p \u2264 0.05), IL-12 (p \u2264 0.02), IFN-\u2425 (p \u2264 0.07), and TNF-\u2423 (p = 0.01) remained significantly higher in both the virusinfected (group-6) and virus-infected, treated animals (group-8) at day 7 when compared to the untreated, uninfected control group of animals (group-5) at day 7. In addition, 10 other cytokines seemed to be at higher levels in both the virus-infected (group-6) and virus-infected, treated animals (group-8) at day 7 when compared to the control group of animals (group-5) at day 7, although these increases were not statistically different. IL-3 was the only cytokine that seemed to be reduced in both the virusinfected animals (group-6) and in the ribavirin-treated, infected mice (group-8) compared to the control animals (group-5).",

Doses evaluated for each compound were near the maximum tolerated dose determined for each in previous experiments or at a dose approximately 10-fold lower than the maximum tolerated dose (data not shown). The results indicated that in EICAR-and mycophenolic acid-treated mice, the lung virus titers increased with increasing dosage, although these increases in lung virus titers were not quite significantly different from the lung virus titers in placebo-treated, infected mice (Table 7) . However, even though the trend for enhancing virus titers was detected, these compounds did not prolong the lung infection as ribavirin did; no virus was detected at day 7 (data not shown).",

There are no current data demon- strating efficacy in vivo, at least in animals. The in vitro studies described in the current report have demonstrated that ribavirin was inactive in various strains of Vero cells, probably due to lack of phosphorylation to the active triphosphate form (Hong and Cameron, 2004; Morgenstern et al., 2005) . In other cell lines such as Caco-2, PK-15, CL-14, HPEK, and MA-104, presumably capable of phosphorylating ribavirin to the triphosphate form, ribavirin was found to be efficacious (IC50 = 2-60 g/ml) at concentrations that could be achieved clinically (Morgenstern et al., 2005) . In the current study, ribavirin evaluated in Vero 76 cells was active at around 270 M (IC50 \u223c 660 g/ml), but was also toxic (average CC50 = 690 M, \u223c1685 g/ml). In our studies, ribavirin was also only inhibitory at very high concentrations in MA-104 cells and CaCo-2 cells and not selectively inhibitory in either cell line. In a number of the studies cited above (Tan et al., 2004; Saijo et al., 2005) , especially those showing the efficacy of combinational therapy with interferon (Morgenstern et al., 2005) , there was a failure to report or to do rigorous (i.e., spectrophotometric analysis) cytotoxicity evaluations. Alternatively, the duration of the assays was so short that toxicity may have been minimized, although in our studies ribavirin was still only inhibitory at very high concentrations. Thus, based on the in vitro data, it has been very difficult to determine if ribavirin is efficacious independent of toxicity and to determine if it should be recommended for treating SARS infections.",

Retrospective analysis of those studies did not demonstrate the efficacy of ribavirin (Mazzulli et al., 2004; Leong et al., 2004) , except in one study in which treatment with ribavirin plus steroid was associated with a better outcome than ribavirin treatment alone . Most studies did not find any association of ribavirin with reduced viral loads (Mazzulli et al., 2004) . In addition, two patients treated with ribavirin early in the infec-tion (days 4 and 6 of illness) seemed to have the highest virus titers in the lungs upon post mortem examination when compared to other patients (Mazzulli et al., 2004) , although Wang et al. (2004) reported that ribavirin reduced viral loads in five of eight patients. In addition to the apparent lack of efficacy in most studies, the risk of ribavirin-induced anemia along with hypoxia resulted in increased risk of death in the treated SARS patients (Chiou et al., 2005) . Thus, ribavirin may not be useful for treating SARS infections because of its questionable efficacy and because of its known toxicity (reviewed by van Vonderen et al., 2003; Lai, 2005) .",

As has been shown by examination of sera from patients with active SARS infections (Mazzulli et al., 2004; Pang et al., 2003) , infection of mice with SARS-CoV also triggered a large increase in inflammatory chemokines in C57BL/6 mice (Glass et al., 2004) . Large increases in proinflammatory cytokines in the sera of patients recovering from SARS infections have also been detected. Likewise, we have shown a large increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs of BALB/c mice. Virus lung titers detected in ribavirin-treated mice (group-8) on day 7 apparently corresponded with a concomitant increase in the levels of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u2423, IL-1\u2424, IL-6, and MCP-1) in the lungs of infected, ribavirin-treated animals (group-8) at this time as opposed to the normal levels of cytokines detected in infected control (group-6) animals at day 7. In contrast, levels of IL-10 and IFN-\u2425, in particular, were substantially higher in the virus-infected mice (group-6). However, the virus in the lung was cleared in infected animals not treated with ribavirin virus (group-6), but was present at high levels in the lungs of ribavirintreated, infected animals (group-8). This observation may reflect the finding in vitro that IFN-\u2425, along with IFN-\u2423 or IFN-\u2424, can reduce virus titers detected in cell culture to below detectable limits (Cinatl et al., 2003a,b; Scagnolari et al., 2004) accounting for the lack of detectable virus in the group-6 animals. The lack of interferon in the ribavirin-treated, infected animals may be due to the lack of sufficient IFN-\u2425 levels to control the virus.",

However, the virus loads in ribavirin-treated infected mice were significantly greater than in the untreated, infected mice and suggest that the return of cytokines to normal levels was not enough to inhibit viral replication.

The possibility also exists that ribavirin might have immunomodulatory properties which adversely affect the clearance of SARS-CoV from the lungs, at least in mice. For example, ribavirin can have an indirect immunomodulatory effect, as it has been shown to decrease the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages of mice . It also has been shown to suppress IL-10 levels in BALB/c mice (Tam et al., 1999) as it did initially in the current study. Ribavirin has been shown to switch the immune response of mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus, another coronavirus, from a Th-2 to Th-1 response (Ning et al., 1998) . In agreement with these findings, ribavirin has been reported to promote T-cell mediated immunity such as the induction of INF-\u2425, TNF-\u2423, and IL-2 (Tam et al., 2002) , none of which were enhanced in the presence of ribavirin in SARS infected mice in our study. Alternatively, one could argue that inbred animals could have some potential genetic defect responsible for enhancement of virus infection in the presence of ribavirin. However, other studies in our laboratory indicate that totally unrelated compounds, such as promazine, also enhance viral infection at certain doses (Barnard et al., 2006) . However, it would be interesting to evaluate ribavirin in outbred animals infected with SARS-CoV.",

This could suggest that a certain cell type essential for viral clearance such as type I pneumocytes or alveolar macrophages may have been functionally inhibited or induced to apoptosis, thus leading to the escape of virus from the initially important first line of defense that prevents or limits viral infection. Supporting this hypothesis are the following studies. IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors have been shown to induce apoptosis in a number of cell types (Jayaram et al., 2002; Meier et al., 2003; Khanna et al., 2004; Anatol et al., 2005; Ishitsuka et al., 2005) . Mycophenolic acid has been shown to suppress production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide, and LDH in macrophages as well as inhibit the enzyme IMP dehydrogenase in the macrophages (Jonsson and Carlsten, 2002) . This suppression of metabolic activities was probably a function of the IMP dehydrogenase inhibitory properties of the mycophenolic acid, since all of the suppressed activities could be reversed with the addition of guanosine. In addition, mycophenolate mofetil has been shown to inhibit differentiation, maturation, and allostimulatory functions of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Colic et al., 2003) . Ribavirin has also been shown to inhibit macrophage production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and Th2 cytokines while preserving Th1 cytokine induction (Ning et al., 1998) . Thus, under the right conditions IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors may actually promote viral infections by suppressing the function of or inhibiting cell types necessary for normal clearance of virus.",
