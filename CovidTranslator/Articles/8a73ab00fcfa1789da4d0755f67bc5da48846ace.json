In addition, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2.3%, and medical workers accounted for 3.8% in COVID-19 patients, as reported by the latest epidemiological study. 13 Previous studies have indicated that in ordinary times, medical workers were vulnerable to sleep disturbances, which may be higher than the general population. 7 China demonstrated that civil servants had the shortest sleep duration (Mean 7.85 hours) and the worst sleep quality, who may experience with more work pressure. 14 Meanwhile, 64.1% of police officers had PSQI > 5 points, and were regarded as sleep disturbances as reported. Their sleep disturbances were related to posttraumatic stress and general psychopathology. 17 A survey from Japan indicated that high occupational stress was significantly associated with insomnia, especially the presence of high efforts but low reward. 18 And exposure to long working hours and irregular work shifts may attribute to stress, fatigue, and chronic diseases, 19 which may influence the quantity and quality of sleep. Schiller et al. 16 compared sleep quality and sleep duration between full worktime subjects and 75% reduced worktime subjects, and found the latter presented with improved sleep quality and sleep duration. The reduction of worktime may be useful for alleviating sleep disturbances.",

However, with the import of supportive fMW from other regions of China, the work duration of fMW may be decreased. By comparison, the non-fMW worked in a relatively mild environment and had less possibility of being infected, thus having less sleep disturbances. Our study also found that scores of PSQI among female fMW were significantly higher than that of male fMW although other scores showed no significant difference, which indicated that female fMW had worse sleep quality than male fMW in emergent events of public health. In a meta-analysis, Zhang et al. 29 calculated a hazard ratio of 1.41 for female versus male toward insomnia. In general, females had inferior symptom bearing and more bodily vigilance, and the social culture encouraged females to express the indisposition more, 30 which potentially exaggerated the severity and prevalence of sleep disturbances. In addition, females tended to report more sleep problems even if having a similar degree of morning awakening compared to males. 29 Our study has several limitations that should be noted. First, this is a cross-sectional study. All subjects were volunteered to participate in the survey, so there may be subject selection bias. Second, other occupations who directly expose to COVID-19 patients may experience sleep disturbances potentially, such as police and social workers, but our study merely included the medical workers. Third, our questionnaires did not contain sufficient items, such as the potential risk factors for sleep disturbances of fMW, which can provide more information and be used to explore the underlying mechanisms. Forth, our study lacked of interventions and .

They are under high risk of being infected and high mental stress, which may lead to sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate sleep disturbances of fMW and made a comparison with non-fMW. The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, were volunteered to participate. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status of fMW. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI>7 points or/and AIS>6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS, and prevalence of sleep disturbances between fMW and non-fMW. Subgroup analysis for different gender in fMW was conducted.",

Tucker et al.25 found moderate work time control for medical workers could improve the sleep quantity that frequent nigh work resulted in, and work time control had association with fewer sleep disturbances. Therefore, it is rational to believe that increased work stress plays a critical role in sleep disturbances of medical workers. With the booming of Chinese economy in past decades, patient visits per physician in China increased by 135% and inpatient admissions per physician rose by 184%. Workload has increased dramatically for Chinese physicians, which exerted a trend that potentially threatened physicians' health and quality of patient care.26 The prevalence of sleep disturbances in Chinese medical workers was 12.9%-78%.7 The present study showed that over 50% of fMW under the outbreak of COVID-19 had sleep disturbances. Although it is even higher than that of in normal times, the prevalence is still compatible to previous results from China. The high prevalence of sleep disturbances of fMW in battle against COVID-19 should be put much emphasize. It was reported that sleep characteristics may exert critical effects on immune functions, which may increase the inflammatory response to sleep deprivation and exert negative feedback to aggravate the short sleep duration and increase the risk of cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic disorders.27 Thus, sleep disturbances would further increase the possibility of fMW being infected with COVID-19 owing to affected immune system.
