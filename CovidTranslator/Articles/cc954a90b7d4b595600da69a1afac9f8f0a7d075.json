In the present study, we compared the phosphorylation status of Akt during infection of MARC-145 cells and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) with highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strain HuN4. We observed that biphasic activation of Akt was induced in at both the early stage (5, 15 and 30 min postinfection) and the late stage (12 and 24 h postinfection) of HP-PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells, while an earlyphase activation of Akt was found exclusively in virusinfected PAMs in vitro. Analysis with the PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 confirmed that PI3K acted as the upstream activator for the virus-induced activation of Akt. UV-irradiation-inactivated virus still induced the early event in PAMs but not in MARC-145 cells, suggesting that different mechanisms are employed for the early-stage induction of phosphorylated Akt within different cell cultures. We further demonstrated that FoxO1 and Bad, which serve as downstream targets of Akt, were phosphorylated in virus-infected MARC-145 cells. Moreover, the suppression of phosphorylated Akt with LY294002 significantly inhibited the virusinduced cytopathic effect (CPE) on MARC-145 cells, but it had a negligible effect on virus propagation. Collectively, our data provide new evidence of a novel role for the PI3K/Akt pathway in PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells.",

In vitro, efficient PRRSV replication is only observed in primary pig macrophages (e.g., alveolar macrophages), differentiated monocytes [13] or cells derived from African green monkey kidney, such as MARC-145 [18] . For easy manipulation, MARC-145 cells provide an important tool for the study of PRRSV replication. Previously, it was reported that the PI3K/Akt pathway is regulated by PRRSV in a complex manner in Mo-DCs [37] , but whether this is a universal phenomenon in all permissive cells is unknown. A number of studies have shown that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is functionally dependent on downstream substrates of Akt such as FoxO1, Bad and mTOR for regulation of cell survival [3, 11, 15, 25] . The downstream targets of Akt controlled by PRRSV have not been identified. The objective of this study was to address how the PI3K/Akt pathway is modulated in infection of MARC-145 cells and PAMs with highly pathogenic PRRSV. We demonstrated that the PI3K/ Akt pathway was activated by HP-PRRSV in a cell-culturedependent manner and that the downstream targets FoxO1 and Bad were regulated through this pathway. In addition, we found that activated PI3K was required for the development of CPE in MARC-145 cells, but not for production of infectious progeny.",

Thus the UV-irradiated HP-PRRSV virus was employed to address this issue. Under the conditions described above, the virus could be completely inactivated (data not shown). Such inactivated virus fails to express viral proteins due to the formation of thymidine dimers, which prevent the transcription of viral genes but do not interfere with the capacity of the virus for receptor binding and entry into host cells by endocytosis [2] . As showed in Fig. 3 , the exposure of cells to UV-irradiated virus led to phosphorylation of Akt at 5 and 15 min postinfection in PAMs (Fig. 3B ), but not in MARC-145 cells (Fig. 3A) . This indicates that virus-cell interactions during the binding or entry process are probably responsible for this event in PAMs, whereas in MARC-145 cells, a different mechanism may account for this activation. by Western blotting using rabbit monoclonal antibodies against phospho-Bad (Ser136), phospho-FoxO1 (Ser256) and phospho-mTOR (Ser2448). Compared to the mockinfected control, virus replication resulted in significantly increased phosphorylation of both FoxO1 and Bad, while no change in mTOR was observed (Fig. 4A) . Phosphorylation with both FoxO1 and Bad were most evident at 24 h p.i., which corresponds in time to the change in phosphorylated Akt. To address whether the change in phosphorylated FoxO1 and Bad was induced by the virus through the PI3K/Akt pathway, the PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 was employed for further investigation. As shown in Fig. 4B) (Fig. 5A) . Unexpectedly, the virus-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway was not essential for production of infectious PRRSV progeny virus. The cytopathic effect (CPE) in HuN4-infected MARC-145 cells is characterized by cell congregation and contraction [31] . Interestingly, in infected MARC-145 cells treated with LY294002, the CPE was significantly alleviated. Under normal conditions, PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells showed considerable CPE at 48 h p.i. (Fig. 5B,  b) , but no CPE was observed in HuN4-infected MARC-145 cells when 10 lM of LY294002 was used to treat the cells (Fig. 5B, d) . In addition, the inhibitor at a concentration of 10 lM could not induce CPE, and it was apparently not cytotoxic to MARC-145 cells, (Fig. 5B, c) , which was confirmed by MTT assay (data not shown). Thus, these findings suggest that the pathway may be linked to HP-PRRSV-induced CPE formation in MARC-145 cells. ",

            "text": "Many viruses interfere with signaling pathways in their infected host cells to favor productive infection, which can also impact on the physiology of the host cell as well as pathogenesis. Therefore, the identification of cellular factors involved in virus replication is important for the design of novel antiviral strategies. In this regard, the manipulation of cellular pathways regulating cell apoptosis or survival affords great advantages to virus replication [35] , and many viruses have been demonstrated to regulate cell survival via the regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway [4, 14] . A previous report has indicated that the PI3K/Akt pathway is activated in the early phase and subsequently inhibited at 12 h p.i. during PRRSV infection of Mo-DCs [37] . Here, HP-PRRSV strain HuN4 was used to further investigate how and why this pathway is controlled by the virus. Here, we report that the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway was significantly enhanced by the HuN4 virus at both the early and late stage of infection of MARC-145 cells, while a distinct pattern was adopted during infection of PAMs in which the phosphorylation of Akt occurred exclusively in the early stage, as early as 5 min p.i., and then returned to the basal level at 45 min p.i. (Figs. 1A and  2 ). When the cells were exposed to the UV-irradiationinactivated virus, significantly increased phosphorylation of Akt was observed in PAMs, but not in MARC-145 cells. Entry of macrophages by PRRSV occurs via a few similar but also different mechanisms compared to entry into MARC-145 cells [12] . It could be inferred that the virus entry process in PAMs was enough to activate the PI3K/ Akt pathway, while a different mechanism of activation was used in MARC-145 cells. It is possible that a different entry mechanism results in this difference in the regulation of Akt. Together with previous data reported by Zhang et al. [37] , we generalize that PRRSV regulates the PI3K/ Akt pathway by different mechanisms in Mo-DCs, PAMs and MARC-145 cells.",

They are normally regulated in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner. For example, the phosphorylation of Bad (Ser-136) was decreased but the phosphorylation of mTOR (Ser2448) and FoxO1 (Ser256) was increased by infection with varicella-zoster virus [27] . Similarly, it has been shown that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade contributes to the establishment of persistent HCV infection [21] . In the present study, we demonstrated that both FoxO1 and Bad were regulated by PRRSV through the control of the PI3K/ Akt pathway in the late stage of infection in MARC-145 cells (Fig. 4) , and therefore the, PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 and PI3K/Akt/Bad cascades may be manipulated by PRRSV to control host-cell survival.",

Unexpectedly, our investigation with the PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 showed that the PI3K/Akt pathway has a negligible effect on the titer of infectious PRRSV progeny in MARC-145 cells (p [ 0.05), as determined at both 36 and 48 h p.i. (Fig. 5A ), but inhibition of this pathway significantly blocked virus-induced CPE formation. To our knowledge, similar results have not been documented for other viruses. Therefore, it will be worthwhile in the future to investigate how the PI3K/Akt pathway regulates CPE formation during PRRSV infection.",

FoxO1 and Bad were employed by the virus as downstream targets of the PI3K/ Akt pathway. Unlike other viruses for which the control of this pathway contributes significantly to virus replication, for PRRSV, it is not important for generation of infectious progeny, but this modulation changes the physiology of the host cell, as revealed by the significant alleviation of CPE. This finding may offer a new and important insight into the role of PI3K/Akt in virus infection, or even in viral pathogenesis.",

(B) Growtharrested MARC-145 cells were first pretreated with LY294002 or mock pretreated with medium containing DMSO. They were then infected with the HuN4 virus at an MOI of 5 or mock-infected with DMEM. At 24 h p.i., the cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting. The fold change of Akt phosphorylation is expressed as densitometric units (Image J 1.45 s, National Institute of Health, USA) of the band normalized to the b-actin level relative to the uninfected control. The results are representative of three independent experiments",

Growth-arrested PAMs were infected with the HuN4 virus at an MOI of 5 or mockinfected with RPMI medium. The infected PAMs were harvested at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h p.i. The cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting. The fold change of Akt phosphorylation is expressed as densitometric units (Image J 1.45 s, National Institute of Health, USA) of the band normalized to the b-actin level relative to the uninfected control.
