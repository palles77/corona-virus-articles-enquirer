At the time of writing (February 21th, 2020), there were 35 patients confirmed COVID-19 cases in Thailand, one of which is a HCW. The HCW is a nurse attendant and became infected during routine medical work in a Thai hospital. The HCW had a contact with another COVID-19 patient who had been given a diagnosis of dengue at the time when the HCW had contact. Since dengue is not a respiratory infection, no respiratory infection control measures were in place for thi patient. However, the hospitalized patient with dengue later received an additional diagnosis of COVID-19.",

Indeed , it is now well known that not all COVID-19 patients have fever or respiratory symptoms at the time of presentation [3] . Nevertheless, COVID-19 might be easily missed in tropical countries, either because it occurs in conjunction with a common infectious disease (such as dengue), or where COVID-19 infection is misdiagnosed as another more common infection.",
