The enveloped virus has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 28 kilo-bases, which has a 5 cap structure and 3 polyadenylation tract. The complete genome sequence of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Beijing isolate, was determined by cloning sequencing and primer walking. The whole genome is 27733 nucleotides in length, has ten open reading frames: 5 -orf1a-orf1ab-s-3a-3b-e-m-6a-6b-n-3 . Alignments of the genome sequence of IBV Beijing isolate with those of two AIBV strains and one SARS coronavirus were performed respectively. The genome sequence of IBV Beijing isolate compared with that of the IBV strain LX4 (uncompleted, 19440 bp in size) was 91.2% similarity. However, the full-length genome sequence of IBV Beijing isolate was 85.2% identity to that of IBV Strain Beaudette, and was only 50.8% homology to that of SARS coronavirus. The results showed that the genome of IBV has remarkable variation. And IBV Beijing isolate is not closely related to SARS coronavirus. Phylogenetic analyses based on the whole genome sequence, S protein, M protein and N protein, also showed that AIBV Beijing isolate is lone virus in group and is distant from SARS coronavirus. In conclusion, this study will contribute to the studies of diagnosis and diseases control on IBV in China.",

In China, IBV leads to more than RMB one billion yuan losses every year. IBV, as a member of the family coronaviridae in the new order Nidovirales, has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome, which is 27.6 kb in length [2] . The genome of IBV has more than 10 open reading frames, which encode two polyproteins and three major structural proteins and other small proteins. Three major structural proteins are the spike glycoprotein (S), the membrane glycoprotein (M), and the phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N). The S protein is cleaved to release S1 and S2 proteins after translation. The S1 protein induces protective immunity [3 5] . And the most antigenic of the virus neutralization antibody-inducing epitopes is formed by a few amino acids that occur in the first and third quarters of the S1 subunit, especially in the hypervariable regions [6, 7] .",

And the genome sequences of IBV are very important and useful for disease diagnosis and vaccination. However, remarkable variation was observed in various IBV isolates: the genome of IBV isolate in this region may be very different with that in the other regions.

A 20-L reaction volume was used for the first strand cDNA synthesis in 3 RACE. The procedure was done as follows: AP (5 -GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTA-CTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3 ) 1 L, mixture contained 10 L total RNA, were heated to 70 for 10 min and was quickly chilled on ice for 1 2 min. After brief cen-mixed gently and heated to 94 for 3 min to denauture. 35 cycles were carried out for 30 s at 94 , 1 min at 62 , 1 min at 72 , with a final extension at 72 for 10 min, then stored at 4 . A 25-L reaction volume was used in 5 RACE for the first strand cDNA synthesis. Mixture consisted of 15.2 L total RNA, 0.3 L GSP1 (5 -ACTTAAGATAGATA-TTAATATA-3 , 25 mol/L) was heated to 70 for 10 min and quickly chilled on ice for 1 2 min. After brief centrifugation , 2.5 L 10 buffer, 2.5 L 0.1 mol/L DTT, 2.5 L 25 mmol/L MgCL 2 , 1 L 10 mmol/L dNTP Mix, 1 L SuperScript RNase H _ RT (200 U/ L) were added. Mixture was mixed gently and incubated at 42 for 1 h. Samples were inactivated at 70 for 15 min and subsequently treated with 1 L RNase Mix (2 U/ L) at 37 for 30 min. cDNA was purified and tailed before PCR. The two steps were done according to the instruction manual. A 30 L reaction volume contained 3 L cDNA, 3 L 10 buffer, 2 L 2.5 mmol/L dNTP each, GSP2 (10 mol/L, 5 -CGCTACTTCCACACACCC-3 ) 0.5 L, AAP(10 mol/L, 5 -GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACG-GGIIGGGIIGGGIIG-3 ) 0.5 L, 0.4 L Taq DNA polymerase (5 U/ L) and 21.3 L ddH 2 O was used for amplification in PCR. PCR was carried out with the following thermocycling parameters: denaturation at 94 for 3 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 for 30 s, annealing at 57 for 45 s, and extension at 72 for 1 min, a final extension at 72for 7 min and stored at 4 . ( ) Sequencing and analysis. PCR products were cut from 1% agarose gels and purified using the GENE-CLEAN",
