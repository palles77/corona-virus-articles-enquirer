Through this research, we evaluated the consistency of the containment rules and identified possible SARS-CoV-2 local mutation using the S.E.I.R mathematical model. We used the most representative epidemic parameters that occurred during the first half of March 2020 to predict the trend of infections. Therefore, to assess the effectiveness of the containment measures, it will signal the presence of a plausible evolutionary mutation. To do this, it will be sufficient to compare the general trend foreseen by the S.E.I.R. with the real Italian population.",

Since the Chinese situation has provided the most information, great statistical importance was given to the Sars-Cov-2 evolution in the Hubei region, with the implicit assumption of \"very significant local mutations\" absence necessary for generalizing the reports through classical inference. The statistics collected on virus mortality were first divided by age group and then recalibrated on the Italian demography, in order to be as representative as possible. To do this, we considered the most representative population of COVID-19 cases reported between March, 1-14, 2020, the number of infected persons necessary to approach the required mortality rate was added to the correct values.",

Thanks to the comparison between real and theoretical evolution, it is likely to estimate the presence of essential mutations and/or the limitation strategy effectiveness through similarities, anomalies, or substantial deviations from each other. We used S.E.I.R. differential equations and non-linear methods to resolve the gaps analytically.

Unfortunately, this figure is extremely negative since it indicates the possible presence of a much more aggressive and/or contagious evolutionary mutation in Lombardy: in fact, the weight of Lombardy in the national statistics of total dead and infected is very high and, moreover, the slope of the growth curve of both it is much greater even than in the second region with the most infected. Quantifying, Lombardy went from 5791 cases on March 10 to 17713 on March 18, i.e. a slope of 1490 cases/day; Emilia Romagna, second region by growth and number of cases, has an average slope over the same period of time equal to 374 cases/day (1533 to 4525 cases).Going further, we can see how three cities in particular are causing alarm: Brescia, Bergamo and Milan, with similar angular coefficients. As if that were not enough, Lombardy holds 66% of national deaths despite representing \"only\" 49% of national cases; in addition, the number of Deaths and Infections grow at a rate much higher than the S.E.I.R. model, despite all government restrictions.",
