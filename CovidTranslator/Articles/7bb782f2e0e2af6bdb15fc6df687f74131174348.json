A challenge with this exceptional level of activity and investment is how to select and resource the most promising approaches to have the most significant impact on public health. The WHO Product Development for Vaccines Advisory Committee (PDVAC) was established in 2014 to provide strategic advice and recommendations to WHO for vaccines in clinical development that could have a significant impact on public health in low and middle income countries. On 7-9th September 2015, PDVAC was convened for the second time, when the committee reviewed vaccine developments in 24 disease areas.

One of the potential key outputs from PDVAC review is the recommendation to generate a WHO guidance document describing the preferred product characteristics (PPCs) for a vaccine against a particular pathogen. These PPC documents describe WHO preferences for vaccines to be used in LMICs; in particular its indications, target groups and features of desirable clinical data related to safety and efficacy. They are intended to provide early guidance to developers at least 5-10 years from vaccine approval, and to ensure that, once licensed, data are available to enable decision-making on use of the vaccine in the populations that need it most.",

For this reason, the 2015 agenda included an overview of the unprecedented process and timeline to interim efficacy data for Ebola vaccines, reports from the ongoing Phase III study, as well as a Target Product Profile that is now finalised and publically available [3] . In addition, the committee was informed of efforts to establish a WHO Blueprint for Emergency R&D Preparedness and Research Response.

Although new vaccines against these conditions may establish a precedent for maternal immunisation as the initial indication, other existing vaccines such as those against influenza and tetanus have been recommended by the WHO for immunisation of pregnant women.

In addition, recent preliminary data in the elderly demonstrated efficacy, and a phase III trial has been initiated in that target population (NCT02608502). GSK and J&J also have RSV F vaccines in clinical development that target pregnant women, and MedImmune is developing an RSV F vaccine for use in the elderly. A number of groups have RSV F vaccines in preclinical development, including NIAID. An RSV subunit vaccine containing the SH protein (Immunovax) is also currently being evaluated in adults. A number of live vaccines are in clinical development for active immunisation of infants and young children, including native RSV candidates from which nonessential genes have been deleted, and an adenovirus vector containing the RSV F gene. Passive prophylaxis with a long-half life monoclonal antibody developed by Medimmune is currently being evaluated in a dose-escalation/pharmacokinetics trial in healthy preterm infants (NCT02290340).",

High levels of maternal anti-capsular polysaccharide (CPS) IgG correlate with reduced neonatal disease risk, and a vaccine against 5 of the 10 circulating serotypes may protect against up to 90% of disease. Two large pharmaceutical companies are currently engaged in GBS vaccine development, with Glaxo SmithKline considering Phase III study designs for their candidate. The proposed approach is to identify specific anti-CPS IgG thresholds as clinical correlates of protection, based on estimation of disease risk reduction, rather than conventional clinical disease end-points. With this in mind, PDVAC recommended that WHO develop guidance on the testing and development pathway for GBS vaccines, including consensus on strategic goals, clinical trial design considerations and development of PPCs. Key development considerations include ethical issues in conducting a vaccine efficacy study in a population with high GBS incidence, such as parts of Africa, where IAP is not the standard of care.",

Molecular reanalysis of randomly selected samples collected in the study, using qPCR rather than culture, confirmed that ETEC and Shigella are two of the most significant pathogens that cause moderate-to-severe diarrhoea among children <5 years old in Africa and South Asia, accounting for around 40% of diarrhoea episodes in 12-23 month olds.

This bivalent candidate vaccine is based on a combination of GI.1 and GII.4 VLPs and is designed to offer cross-protection against the 25 human genotypes.

The greatest mortality burden is due to rheumatic heart disease, but invasive GAS diseases such as maternal sepsis also contribute significantly. Previous human challenge studies, as well as vaccine trials, suggest that it is biologically feasible to develop a vaccine, however vaccine development has been impeded by safety concerns regarding the potential for induction of GAS-mediated autoimmune diseases such as acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APGN). Although a number of recombinant, multivalent vaccine candidates have been developed, they are struggling to secure investment beyond early stage clinical studies.",

HSV type 1 (HSV-1), which infects the majority of the world's population, typically causes oral lesions but is also an increasingly important cause of genital infection. Control of HSV-2 infection is of particular concern for LMICs because it increases both acquisition and transmission of HIV infection. Previous development efforts for a prophylactic HSV vaccine did not show efficacy against HSV-2 but did demonstrate some efficacy against HSV-1 [15] , suggesting that a vaccine against this class of viruses is biologically feasible. Currently, therapeutic vaccine candidates are more advanced than those with prophylactic indications, with one candidate demonstrating a 55% reduction in viral shedding.",
