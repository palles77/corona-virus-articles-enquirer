This latter infection has been reported as the main viral cause of hospitalization in infants, followed by RV and influenza virus. 4 Unexpected outbreaks can also be caused by emerging or re-emerging pathogens, such as enterovirus (EV)-D68, which was responsible for the nationwide US outbreak of mild-to-severe respiratory illness in 2014 that especially affected the pediatric population. 5 Even though respiratory viruses generally cause self-limited illnesses, the societal effect is significant because of work and school absenteeism, medical visits, and misuse of antibiotics. 6 Furthermore, lower respiratory tract infections, chronic infections, and complications, such as bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and asthma exacerbations, are frequent in young children, immunocompromised subjects, or those with underlying conditions. Despite this considerable burden to individual well-being and the public health care system, supportive care is the only therapeutic option against most respiratory viruses. 7 Therefore a better understanding of their pathogenesis is crucial to develop more effective antiviral drugs or vaccines.",

            "text": "Because cellular receptors are species specific for most human respiratory viruses, only a few animal models exist to study this prevalent and diverse group of pathogens. Selected mouse strains or transgenic mice expressing human receptors, as well as mouse-adapted viruses, are used [8] [9] [10] ; however, they mimic poorly pathogenesis in a human host. Most in vitro studies are performed in immortalized cells and sometimes in primary cells derived from human airways, but these cell lines cannot fully reproduce the complexity of the human airway epithelium. In addition, some respiratory viruses, such as RVs from species C, grow poorly in standard cell lines. 11 In this respect much effort has been dedicated to develop more representative models, such as airway epithelia reconstituted from primary cells isolated from nasal or bronchial surgeries. These air-liquid interface tissue-culture systems have been validated for the study of respiratory viruses, such as RSV, 12 influenza, 13 human coronaviruses (HCoVs), and RVs. [14] [15] [16] They reproduce the pseudostratified architecture of the human airway epithelium, which is composed of basal, ciliated, and goblet cells, as well as its defense mechanisms (ie, mucociliary clearance [MCC] and epithelial cell immunity). [17] [18] [19] Using standardized in vitro-reconstituted human airway epithelia and clinical viral strains, we could compare infection patterns by the most prevalent respiratory viruses, including 5 RVs, a respiratory EV, RSV, influenza, and HCoV. For each infection, we compared the replication kinetics, cellular tropism, and effect of the virus on tissue integrity or cytokine secretion. In addition, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing (HTS) on viruses and host tissues collected at different times after infection to investigate changes in viral populations and tissue response. Our data highlight the differential in vitro pathogenesis of these representative respiratory pathogens and reveal the systematic viral persistence in the absence of a fully competent immune response.",

Viral RNA copies (10 6 ) corresponding to the average load found in clinical samples [30] [31] [32] were used in each round of infection. Viruses on the apical surfaces of infected tissues were quantified by using qPCR to assess residual viral loads (remaining after 3 wash steps, 4 hours after inoculation) and subsequent virion replication (collected at 24-hour intervals thereafter). There was no reproducibility in the amount of residual virus for each virus type, probably because of tissue properties, washing efficiency, or both rather than the physicochemical characteristics of the virus. In contrast, apical viral release from day 1 onward was reproducible among replicates (Fig 1, A) , peaking at days 2 to 4 after inoculation and ranging from 10 7 to 10 11 viral RNA copies for RV-B48 and EV-D68, respectively. Overall, replication rates were significantly greater for EV-D68 versus all other viruses, for H3N2 and RV-A49 versus RV-B48 and HCoV-OC43, and for RV-A55 versus RV-B48 (all P < .01).

Surprisingly, all respiratory viruses tested were detected constantly over the 28-day culture period. Viral persistence was reported in similar tissue culture systems for a recombinant RSV-green fluorescent protein, 33 as well as in calf tracheal organ cultures for bovine RV and influenza A. 34 Here we extend these observations and show that 9 single-stranded RNA respiratory viruses with highly diverse biological characteristics systematically produced persistent infections in cultured human respiratory tissues. Persistence could not be explained by major viral changes because HTS of RV-C15, RV-B48, and EV-D68 collected at 16 dpi or later were not significantly different from those isolated in acute infection, either in viral population composition or in the appearance of defective interfering viral particles. On the other hand, transcriptome analysis of host tissues infected with RV-C15 and RV-B48 showed that innate immunity is strongly induced during the acute phase of infection but decreases thereafter and is insufficient to clear the infection. Although all these viruses usually cause self-limited diseases, chronic infections have been documented in immunocompromised populations, 27 supporting our observation and confirming that an effective immune response is required for viral clearance.",

Here we detected EV-D68 RNA in ciliated and nonciliated cells. Interestingly, these nonciliated cells had no goblet or basal cell markers and might represent a population of differentiating cells involved in tissue repair. Of note, influenza, EV-D68, and HCoV-OC43 use sialic acid as a receptor and showed differential cell tropism in the tissues. Therefore specific coreceptors might be required for infection or other viral functions and could play a role in this distinct tropism.",

            "text": "After inoculation with the different viruses, marked differences in tissue toxicity were observed. First, all viruses, except HCoV-OC43 and RV-B48, affected cilia beating and MCC. RV-B has already been shown to be less cytotoxic and induce less cytokine production (including interferons) in vitro than RV-A and RV-C. 20 In our study it also induced less IFN-l than the other viruses. In addition, HTS of tissues infected with RV-B48 showed significantly fewer changes in gene expression profiles than tissues infected with RV-C15. In particular, processes related to cilia morphogenesis were not affected by RV-B48, supporting the observed absence of perturbation of MCC and cilia beating by this virus. Concerning HCoV-OC43, the absence of effect on tissue was associated with an even weaker induction of cytokines. Among all tested cytokines, only IP-10 and IL-6 were induced, although at significantly lower levels than by all other respiratory viruses. The ability of coronaviruses to remain undetected by innate immune sensors has been unraveled recently. 40 Interestingly, for most viruses that affected cilia beating and MCC, a limited number of cells was infected, and the ciliated cell layer was preserved. This observation suggests a paracrine effect, propagated disorganization of cilia beating, or both. It has been shown that infection by HCoV-E229 does not affect tissue integrity in vitro and cilia beating in vivo. 41 Cilia dyskinesia was observed, and Wang et al 41 suggested that it would affect MCC; however, HCoV-E229 might have a more expanded cell tropism compared with other HCoV species and might thus be more virulent than HCoV-OC43. 37 Regarding the other respiratory viruses, RVs from species A and C, as well as RSV-B, affected MCC but without causing significant cell death or loss in tissue integrity. These observations were confirmed with RSV-A (data not shown). Previous studies with RSV-A in air-liquid interface cultures showed no change in cilia beating frequencies at 72 hours after infection, but ciliary dyskinesia was increased. 42 However, this finding does not contradict our data because in our case inhibition of cilia beating for this virus started at only 4 dpi. In addition, our RSV-B was produced in tissue directly from a clinical sample, whereas in the study by Smith et al, 42 the RSV-A stock was produced in BSC-1 monkey kidney cells and was potentially cell adapted. For RVs, the low number of infected cells and a weak effect on mucosal integrity has already been demonstrated. [43] [44] [45] Similarly, in vitro and in vivo RSV infections were also associated with little tissue damage, 12 which is an unexpected finding for a virus that is highly pathogenic in vivo. However, it has been previously proposed that RSV pathogenicity in vivo is mainly immune mediated. 12 Surprisingly, the RV-C8 strain that was associated with a disseminated human infection 26 was not particularly virulent in our model. This result suggests that the in vivo dissemination and virulence is linked to host rather than viral factors.",

In vitro virulence of EV-D68 is particularly striking when compared with that of RVs belonging to the same genus. This difference might account for the frequent complicated diseases observed during EV-D68 infections. 5 Different strains of influenza (H3N2, H1N1, or influenza B) are also known to affect tissue integrity, cilia beating, and MCC in mice, rats, pigs, and human subjects. [47] [48] [49] [50] In addition, we observed similar induction of LDH release and blockage of MCC with an H1N1 clinical isolate (data not shown).

Based on cytokine (Fig 4) and transcriptome (Fig 7) profiles of infected tissues and on published data, several pathways have shown promise as targets for antiviral therapies. For example, inhibitors of the inflammatory IkB kinase, 51 nuclear factor kB signaling pathways, 52 and biological processes related to protein localization and targeting, 53,54 as well as type III interferon-based therapies (reviewed by Syedbasha and Egli 55 ), have all been reported to exhibit a direct antiviral activity or to counteract virally activated pathways. Based on our data, these molecules represent valuable targets to fight the infection, as well as its subsequent biological consequences and associated symptoms. Other recently characterized broad-spectrum antiviral molecules known to be effective against enveloped and nonenveloped viruses could also be further validated in this system, such as oxysterols, which interfere with the formation of viral replication organelles 56 or direct-acting antiviral drugs active in vitro against several types of viruses, such as sialidase-derived compounds 57 or polymerase inhibitors. 58 Thus this clinically relevant and unique tissue-culture model could be used to test promising compounds for their tissue toxicity and broad-spectrum antiviral activity (either as prevention or treatment). Because the model is applicable to diverse respiratory viruses circulating in the population (including poorly cultivable ones, such as RV-C), these studies will provide valuable and wide-ranging information that might better guide later in vivo models.",
