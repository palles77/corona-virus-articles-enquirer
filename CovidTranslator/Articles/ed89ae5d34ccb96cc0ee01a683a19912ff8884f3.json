            "text": "The ability to attach different functional moieties to a molecular building block 1,2 could lead to applications in nanoelectronics 3 , nanophotonics 4 , intelligent sensing 5 and drug delivery 6, 7 . The building unit needs to be both multivalent and anisotropic, and although many anisotropic building blocks have been created 1,8-12 , these have not been universally applicable. Recently, DNA has been used to generate various nanostructures [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] or hybrid systems [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , and as a generic building block for various applications [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Here, we report the creation of anisotropic, branched and crosslinkable building blocks (ABC monomers) from which multifunctional nanoarchitectures have been assembled. In particular, we demonstrate a target-driven polymerization process in which polymers are generated only in the presence of a specific DNA molecule, leading to highly sensitive pathogen detection. Using this monomer system, we have also designed a biocompatible nanovector that delivers both drugs and tracers simultaneously. Our approach provides a general yet versatile route towards the creation of a range of multifunctional nanoarchitectures.",

To create the ABC monomer, branched, Y-shaped DNA (Y-DNA) conjugated with different moieties served as the modular donor and X-shaped DNA (X-DNA) was used as the core acceptor molecule (Fig. 1 ). Anisotropy was achieved by designing unique DNA sequences at the end of each branch of the core X-DNA. Because of the freedom in synthesizing any desired DNA sequence at any position, the diversity of anisotropy (from different sequences) is practically unlimited. Multifunctionality was realized by the specific connection of different donor Y-DNA onto the same acceptor X-DNA. Single-stranded bridge DNA with a sequence complementary to both acceptor and donor sequences was used to connect the Y-DNA to the X-DNA. To simplify the notation, we named each unique end-sequence as West, North and East based on the branch orientation (designated W, N and E for Y-DNA and W 0 , N 0 and E 0 for X-DNA, with subscript i used sometimes to distinguish different sequences; Fig. 1 ). The bridge DNAs were notated correspondingly (w, n and e in lower-case letters).",

To build up a multifunctional polymer from ABC monomers, we designed different modules separately including DNA capture probes, fluorescent dyes, quantum dots and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, not shown in this paper; for DNA sequences see Supplementary Tables S1, S2 ). In addition, by incorporating a polyethylene glycol monoacrylate (PEGA) moiety onto the Y-DNA (see Supplementary Figs S1-S3), we further introduced a new capability for photo-crosslinking (for sequences, see Supplementary Table S3 ). The resulting ABC monomers, now with multiple and varying functional groups, can thus be photo-polymerized using the built-in photoreactive groups.",

The monomers were characterized using gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2a, b ; see also Supplementary Fig. S4b ), which revealed that the fluorescence colours of the ABC monomers corresponded to the various combinations of donor Y-DNAs. Without adding the bridge DNA, only unconnected green donor Y-DNAs were shown (Fig. 2b, lane 1) . Unreacted acceptor X-DNAs, which carried no fluorescence dyes, were dark and undetectable but could be seen upon staining with a DNA-specific dye (ethidium bromide; see Supplementary Fig. S4b ). After the w bridge DNA was added to the reaction, a single green band with retarded electrophoretic mobility could be observed (Fig. 2b, lane 2) , suggesting that (i) the green fluorescence dye was exclusively attached to the West branch of the X-DNA (X-W 0 ) and (ii) the product was monodispersed. Similar results were obtained with fluorescence dye attached to the East and North branches of the X-DNA after adding e and n bridge DNA (Fig. 2b, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). To link two different configurations of fluorescence dyes simultaneously onto two different branches of a single X-DNA, we added two bridge DNAs simultaneously (Fig. 2b, lanes 5-7) . By adding all three bridge DNAs, all three different donor Y-DNAs were anisotropically linked onto the X-DNA simultaneously (Fig. 2b, lane 8) in a controlled fashion. This approach is robust and efficient; the estimated yield of ABC monomers is close to 90%, as estimated by densitometry.",

Recently, DNA has been used to generate various nanostructures [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] or hybrid systems [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , and as a generic building block for various applications [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Here, we report the creation of anisotropic, branched and crosslinkable building blocks (ABC monomers) from which multifunctional nanoarchitectures have been assembled. In particular, we demonstrate a target-driven polymerization process in which polymers are generated only in the presence of a specific DNA molecule, leading to highly sensitive pathogen detection. Using this monomer system, we have also designed a biocompatible nanovector that delivers both drugs and tracers simultaneously.

To create the ABC monomer, branched, Y-shaped DNA (Y-DNA) conjugated with different moieties served as the modular donor and X-shaped DNA (X-DNA) was used as the core acceptor molecule (Fig. 1) . Anisotropy was achieved by designing unique DNA sequences at the end of each branch of the core X-DNA. Because of the freedom in synthesizing any desired DNA sequence at any position, the diversity of anisotropy (from different sequences) is practically unlimited. Multifunctionality was realized by the specific connection of different donor Y-DNA onto the same acceptor X-DNA. Single-stranded bridge DNA with a sequence complementary to both acceptor and donor sequences was used to connect the Y-DNA to the X-DNA. To simplify the notation, we named each unique end-sequence as West, North and East based on the branch orientation (designated W, N and E for Y-DNA and W 0 , N 0 and E 0 for X-DNA, with subscript i used sometimes to distinguish different sequences; Fig. 1 ). The bridge DNAs were notated correspondingly (w, n and e in lower-case letters).",

To build up a multifunctional polymer from ABC monomers, we designed different modules separately including DNA capture probes, fluorescent dyes, quantum dots and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, not shown in this paper; for DNA sequences see Supplementary Tables S1, S2 ). In addition, by incorporating a polyethylene glycol monoacrylate (PEGA) moiety onto the Y-DNA (see Supplementary Figs S1-S3), we further introduced a new capability for photo-crosslinking (for sequences, see Supplementary Table S3 ). The resulting ABC monomers, now with multiple and varying functional groups, can thus be photo-polymerized using the built-in photoreactive groups.",

The monomers were characterized using gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2a, b ; see also Supplementary Fig. S4b ), which revealed that the fluorescence colours of the ABC monomers corresponded to the various combinations of donor Y-DNAs. Without adding the bridge DNA, only unconnected green donor Y-DNAs were shown (Fig. 2b , lane 1). Unreacted acceptor X-DNAs, which carried no fluorescence dyes, were dark and undetectable but could be seen upon staining with a DNA-specific dye (ethidium bromide; see Supplementary Fig. S4b ). After the w bridge DNA was added to the reaction, a single green band with retarded electrophoretic mobility could be observed (Fig. 2b , lane 2), suggesting that (i) the green fluorescence dye was exclusively attached to the West branch of the X-DNA (X-W 0 ) and (ii) the product was monodispersed. Similar results were obtained with fluorescence dye attached to the East and North branches of the X-DNA after adding e and n bridge DNA (Fig. 2b , lanes 3 and 4, respectively). To link two different configurations of fluorescence dyes simultaneously onto two different branches of a single X-DNA, we added two bridge DNAs simultaneously (Fig. 2b, lanes 5-7) . By adding all three bridge DNAs, all three different donor Y-DNAs were anisotropically linked onto the X-DNA simultaneously (Fig. 2b , lane 8) in a controlled fashion. This approach is robust and efficient; the estimated yield of ABC monomers is close to 90%, as estimated by densitometry.",

Consequently, an ABC dimer formed only in the presence of a targeted pathogen DNA because the pathogen DNA now served as a complementary linker DNA to link the two ABC monomers 1A and 1B together (see 2 in Fig. 3a ). Following a short UV illumination (10 min), photo-crosslinking occurred with the dimers but not with the monomers (Fig. 3a, species 3) . In other words, we have successfully developed a 'target-driven' polymerization where polymers (diblock co-polymers in this case) can only be synthesized in the presence of a specific target DNA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a polymerization process has been designed to be dependent on the presence of a pathogen DNA. This novel polymerization approach can be used to generate detectable polymers for pathogen sensing.",

In addition, the diameters of the resulting polymeric spheres can be further controlled by varying the concentrations of the starting ABC monomer (see Supplementary Fig. S9b ).

We first added an 'unknown' DNA, and after targetdriven photo-polymerization the resultant spheres had a colour ratio of 1G1R (Fig. 4a) . By referring to the pre-assigned fluorescence codes (see Supplementary Table S4 ), this result indicated that the 'unknown' DNA was the SARS DNA. Similarly, Anthrax and Ebola DNA were detected with 1G3R and 4G0R, respectively (Fig. 4b, c) . The detection was highly specific: in the presence of an unrelated DNA, no polymerized spheres were observed (Fig. 4d) because polymerization could not occur with only mono-PEGA-ABC monomers. Interestingly, we found that the concentrations of polymeric spheres (that is, the number per unit area obtained from microscopy images) were linearly proportional to the log of concentrations of target DNA (Fig. 4e) . Thus we can easily detect the presence and approximate concentration of the pathogen DNA by simply counting the polymeric spheres under the microscope. The estimated detection limit was 100 fM under current conditions (Fig. 4e) . This method also allows for a wide dynamic range (four orders of magnitude) of detection.",

Microscopy images revealed that similarly sized spheres were internalized by HeLa cells (Fig. 5a-c) . The cellular uptake was attributed to endocytosis, because no fluorescence was observed inside the cells when endocytosis was inhibited (see Supplementary Fig. S11a,b) . These results suggest that the cells can internalize these multi-drug carriers without any additional treatment with a transfection reagent. To further understand the uptake mechanisms, we evaluated the cellular uptake in the presence of various endocytosis-specific inhibitors.

The measured distance based on STEM annular darkfield images was 44.8 + 7.3 nm. endocytosis such as phagocytosis and macropinocytosis was the main mechanism (see Supplementary Fig. S12 ). It is noteworthy that these ABC polymers exhibited little cytotoxicity. After a 36-h treatment with ABC monomers, HeLa cells showed more than 90% cell viability (or less than 10% cytotoxicity was observed; Fig. 5d ). Using the conditions reported here, we were able to obtain a delivery efficiency of 25% (data not shown). Although further investigations are needed to optimize delivery efficiency, we have demonstrated that our ABC polymers provide a general route to carry different moieties within one entity for both delivery and tracing.",

In addition, we have shown that these nanoarchitectures can be used as multi-drug carriers that are readily internalized by cells without any other chemical reagents. It is important to note that our ABC monomer system is designed to be modular. The built-in 'plug-and-play' feature coupled with its 'mix-and-match' flexibility makes the ABC monomer a versatile platform technology-any other functional groups, both organic and inorganic, that can be conjugated with DNA (or RNA) can be incorporated into the final nanoarchitectures. Thus, we anticipate that our ABC monomers will lead to many possibilities for creating more novel nanostructures and nanomaterials with multiple functionalities.",
