            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel porcine enteric coronavirus that causes diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration in piglets. This newly virus has spread rapidly and has caused serious economic losses for pig industry since the outbreak in USA in 2014. In this study, 430 faecal and intestinal samples (143 faecal samples and 287 intestinal samples) were collected from individual pigs with diarrhea and 211 serum samples were also collected from the sows with mild diarrhea in 17 regions in Henan province, China from April 2015 to March 2018. The RT-PCR detection indicated that the infection of PDCoV was high up to 23.49% (101/430), and coinfection with PEDV were common (60.40%, 61/101) in Henan pigs. The prevalence of PDCoV in suckling piglets was the highest (36.43%, 94/258). We also found that PDCoV could be detected in sows faeces and sera while the sows showed mild, self-limited diarrhea in clinic. The complete genomes of 4 PDCoV Henan strains (CH-01, HNZK-02, HNZK-04, HNZK-06) were sequenced and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete genome, spike and nucleocapsid gene sequences revealed that the PDCoV Henan strains were closely related to other PDCoV reference strains that located in the Chinese clade. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis showed PDCoV CH-01 strain was closely related to CHN-HB-2014 strain and HKU15-44 strain, while the other PDCoV Henan strains were more related to PDCoV CHJXNI2 and CH-SXD1-2015 strains, indicating that the ancestor of these sequenced strains may different. These results would support the understanding of the prevalence and evolution characteristics of PDCoV in China.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses that can be classified into four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus (Ma et al., 2015) . Coronaviruses from different genera can infect diverse host species, mainly including mammals and birds (Woo et al., 2010; Chan et al., 2013) . Deltacoronavirus, a novel genus, was first found in Asian leopard cat and Chinese ferret badgers in Hong Kong and then identified in a variety of avian species (Dong et al., 2007) . In 2012, the porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first discovered in pigs in Hong Kong (Woo et al., 2012) . To date, six coronaviruses have been identified from pigs, including the Alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), the Betacoronavirus genus porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis coronavirus (PHEV), and the Deltacoronavirus genus PDCoV (Jung et al., 2016b; Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018) . The clinical symptom caused by PDCoV in piglets is similar to that of the PEDV and TGEV infection, including severe diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration (Hu et al., 2016; Jung et al., 2016a) . However, the clinical symptom and mortality caused by PDCoV are milder than PEDV infection in piglets (Jung et al., 2016a) . Furthermore, PDCoV commonly co-infected with PEDV and TGEV in natural infections and has seriously harmed the development of the pig industry (Hu et al., 2015) . Currently, there are no effective reagents and vaccines to control PDCoV infection. PDCoV has the smallest genome size among coronaviruses and the full-length genome is approximately 25.4 kb with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail . The two-thirds of PDCoV genome at the 5\u2032 end encodes genome replication proteins (ORF1ab) and one-third at the 3\u2032 end encodes four mainly structural proteins, T spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N), and three accessory proteins, including nonstructural protein 6 (NS6), NS7, and NS7a (Woo et al., 2012; Jang et al., 2017) . The PDCoV S protein is a glycoprotein on the viral surface and plays an essential function in mediating viral entry into host cells by binding with host receptors (Graham and Baric, 2010; Shang et al., 2017) . In addition, PDCoV S gene encodes the most antigenic protein and frequently used for studying the genetic relationships among different PDCoV strains and the epidemiological investigation (Shang et al., 2017) . The highly conserved coronaviruses N protein produces largely in infected cells and plays a vital function in viral replication and pathogenesis. The recent study showed that the multifunctional role of PDCoV N protein is similar to other coronaviruses (Lee and Lee, 2015) .",

This novel coronavirus was then further detected in more than 20 US states (Marthaler et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014b; Sinha et al., 2015) . Subsequently, PDCoVs were detected in pigs in Canada, South Korea, mainland China, Thailand and Laos (Lee and Lee, 2014; Janetanakit et al., 2016; Saeng-Chuto et al., 2017; Ajayi et al., 2018) . In China, PDCoV infection in pig farms with diarrhea occurred in some provinces and regions since 2014 Dong et al., 2016; Zhai et al., 2016) . Previous study also showed that PDCoV was detected in diarrheic pig samples collected as early as 2004 in China (Dong et al., 2015) . Sequence analyses suggested that all the known PDCoVs strains have a high nucleotide similarity with the earliest discovered strains, HKU15-44 and HKU15-155 (Jung et al., 2016b) , and all reported China PDCoV strains are closely related with each other and located in the same clade (Song et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2018; Mai et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018) . Henan province is a major pig-raising region in China. According to the data of the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the number of pigs in stock in the first half year of 2018 in Henan province was about 42 million with the percentage of 10.2% in the whole stock pigs in China. However, little is reported regarding the prevalence and epidemiology of PDCoV in Henan province.",

The PCR products were purified using the SanPrep Column DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China). Both strands of the PCR products were sequenced twice with an ABI Prism 3700 DNA analyzer (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) by using the forward and reverse PCR primers. The sequences of the PCR products were compared with the known S gene sequences of PDCoVs in the GenBank database. The PDCoV positive test samples were then further used to detect PEDV and TGEV. To detect PEDV and TGEV from the samples' RNA, two pair of primers targeting the M gene of PEDV (5\u2032-TGGTGGTCTTTCAATC CTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTGAGTAGTCGCCGTGTTT-3\u2032) and the N gene of TGEV ( 5\u2032-CGCTATCGCATGGTGAAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGATTGTTGCCTGCCTCT-3\u2032) were designed based on the sequence of the JXNC1302 strain (GenBank accession no.

Further phylogenetic analysis based on the complete genomes of PDCoV indicated that PDCoV CH-01 strain isolated in Henan was grouped within the Chinese clade and closely related to CHN-HB-2014 strain (KP757891) and HKU15-44 strain (JQ065042). (Fig. 3B) . However, the PDCoV HNZK-02, HNZK-04 and HNZK-06 strains were located in the same separate subcluster and more related to PDCoV CHJXNI2 strain (KR131621) and CH-SXD1-2015 strain (KT021234), indicating that the origin of these isolated strains may be different (Fig. 3B) .",

Phylogenetic analysis based on the entire S genes of PDCoV showed that CH-01 strain was closely related with CHN-HB-2014 and HKU15-44 strains (Fig. 4A) . As the phylogenetic tree based on the PDCoV complete genome, the other 3 sequenced PDCoV Henan strains (HNZK-02, HNZK-04 and HNZK-06) were still closely related each other and located in the same separate subcluster, and they also showed a close relationship with CHJXNI2 and CH-SXD1-2015 strains.

PDCoV is a novel swine intestine coronavirus and has caused serious economic losses for pig industry (Hu et al., 2015) . So far, PDCoV has been reported in several countries and the pathogenicity for this novel virus has been studied using the neonatal piglets (Wang et al., 2014a; Wang et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2016) . However, little regarding the molecular epidemiology of PDCoV has been reported in Henan province, a major pigraising region of China. In the present study, we investigated the PDCoV prevalence in the diarrheal pigs in different regions and analyzed the full-length genome sequence properties of PDCoV strains in Henan province, which might provide more insight about the pigs diarrhea outbreaks in China.",

Previous reports have shown that the prevalence of PDCoV in diarrheal pigs in Guangdong and Jiangxi were 21.8% and 33.71%, respectively (Song et al., 2015; Mai et al., 2018) . In addition, the molecular-based detection also showed a relatively high prevalence of PDCoV infection in South Korea pigs and the total positive rate was 19.03% (Jang et al., 2017) . The prevalence of PDCoV in Tibetan diarrheal pigs surrounding the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China was significantly lower than that in other provinces and the positive rate was only 3.70% . For the limitation of the collected sample sizes, especially in the regions of Xu Chang (3), Luo He (3), An Yang (6), Ji Yuan (6) and Xin Yang (6), the PDCoV existence in the pig herds need to be verified by evaluating more samples. So we will continue to surveil the PDCoV prevalence in these regions. In addition, we only have collected the samples from pigs with diarrhea but not collected the samples from pigs without such symptoms to detect PDCoV infection. We will also collect the samples from pigs without diarrhea to fully evaluate the prevalence of PDCoV in Henan pig herds.",

Our result also suggested that the positive rate of PDCoV infection in spring and winter was striking higher than the positive rate in summer and autumn and the prevalence of PDCoV in the diarrheal pigs reached a high level in the winter, indicating that this novel virus infection mainly occurred in the cold season. Furthermore, the detection showed that the positive rate of PDCoV infection in suckling piglets was highest and the rate was 36.43%. Interestingly, our results also showed that PDCoV can be discovered in sows and the positive rates were 2.59% in faecal samples and 25.59% in serum samples, indicating that the PDCoV can infect sows and infection rate was increasing. Previous reports showed that PEDV can infect the pigs of all growth stages, including sows and caused severe vomiting and watery diarrhea (Yu et al., 2018) . However, PDCoV mainly infected the piglets but rarely infected the sows in previous reports Wang et al., 2018) . Previous report suggested that the PDCoVs were only detected in Tibetan pigs under 1 month of age but PEDV could detected in pigs of different ages . A recent report found that the PDCoV can infect the sows and the infection rate was up to 22.4% in sows . In this study, we also proved this result, indicated that we will need to continue monitoring the infection of PDCoV in sows. The co-infections of PDCoV with PEDV and TGEV in natural infections were common in previous reports (Song et al., 2015; Jang et al., 2017; Mai et al., 2018) . Our detection also found that co-infections of PDCoV with PEDV were common in Henan diarrheal pigs and 61 of 101 (60.40%) PDCoV positive samples were proved to be positive for PEDV. The co-infections of diarrhea coronavirus have caused severe mortality in piglets (Song et al., 2015) and further study will needed to elucidate the prevalence of these viruses in Henan province.",
