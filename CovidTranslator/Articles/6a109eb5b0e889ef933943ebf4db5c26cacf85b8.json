Intragastric immunization of the recombinant strain conferred protective immunity against Salmonella infection in mice. This immunization did not result in antigen-specific antibody in either feces or sera but induced the release of IFN-\u2425 on restimulation of primed lymphocytes ex vivo. The results suggested that the protective efficacy provided by flagellin-expressing L. casei is mainly attributable to cell-mediated immune responses. In addition, an adjuvant-type effect of the antigen delivery system with L. casei was also observed.",

There are a number of reports of oral vaccine candidates established from genetically modified pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella and Listeria [1] [2] [3] [4] , or commensal bacteria such as Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus species. While both pathogenic and commensal bacteria have advantages and disadvantages as an antigen delivery vehicle, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) may be preferable in terms of safety control and minimization of side effects. A series of pioneering studies about LAB expressing tetanus toxin fragment C (TTFC) achieved a highly effective vaccination against tetanus toxin [5] [6] [7] . In addition, there are other * Corresponding author. Tel.: +81 3 3700 1141. studies about LAB-associated model vaccines such as L. lactis expressing the V2-V4 loop from HIV [8] , SpaA from Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae [9] , VP7 from rotavirus [10] , Lactobacillus casei expressing the N-terminal glycoprotein S from coronavirus [11] , the Spike protein segment from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus [12] , and Lactobacillus plantarum expressing Urease B subunit from Helicobacter pylori [13] . This field of study, however, still needs further research in order to establish practical LAB-associated vaccines. Information about cellular immune responses induced by LAB expressing antigens is especially required because most previous studies concluded that the protective efficacy was due to the production of a neutralizing antibody. There are several lines of evidence that LAB strains promote the production of Th1-type cytokines such as gamma interferon (IFN-\u2425) and interleukin 12 (IL-12) [14] [15] [16] [17] , which suggests that LAB strains have the potential to be an antigen delivery vehicle eliciting cellular immune responses.",

SE is a pathogen contaminating eggs and causing diarrhea or severe illness. Since SE is a facultative intracellular bacterium, cell-mediated immune responses are required for its clearance. In fact, a FliC-specific Th1type response was induced during infections of Salmonella [18, 19] . Thus, recombinant LAB expressing FliC seems to be well suited for investigations into whether LAB-associated vaccines can be used to evoke cellular immune responses. Moreover, the combination of FliC and L. casei is appropriate to evaluate the adjuvant effect of L. casei as an antigen delivery vehicle because protective immunity induced by the oral vaccination of purified flagellin of SE has been already reported [20] . We used C3H/HeJ mice, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-hyporesponsive strain, to preclude the effect of LPS and test the FliC-expressing L. casei by oral administration.",

This phenomenon indicates that other immune systems such as cell-mediated immunity were involved. In fact, the Th1-type immune response, associated with cellular immunity, is known to be an important component of the protection against Salmonella. Regarding this point, we determined whether the lymphocytes primed with FliC-expressing lactobacilli had the ability to induce IFN-\u2425 production as a benchmark of Th1-type immune responses. A high level of IFN-\u2425 production was elicited from the primed lymphocytes by stimulation with flagellin ex vivo. Moreover, the ability was much higher than that of soluble flagellin even though the amount of antigen for the priming was about 10-fold lower. CD4 + cells producing IFN-\u2425 in response to the stimulation were also detected by flow cytometry. These results suggest that FliC-specific cellular immunity can be induced by immunization with L. casei producing FliC and be enhanced in combination with the bacterial cells. The production level of the cytokine correlated with the efficacy of protective immunity conferred by the recombinant L. casei, hence this immune response probably contributes to the protection against SE.",

The levels of IFN-\u2425 produced by primed and flagellin-restimulated lymphocytes were compared between three forms of immunizing agent, i.e. recombinant L. casei exposing FliC on the cell surface, a mixture of purified flagellin and normal L. casei, and purified flagellin alone. The result, that immunization with recombinant lactobacilli elicits IFN-\u2425 production more efficiently than that with the free-form of flagellin with or without normal L. casei, indicates that this Lactobacillus strain functions as an adjuvant if FliC is exposed on the cellsurface. Every Lactobacillus strain has several components which elicit innate immune responses through molecular pattern-recognition receptors of mammalian cells such as peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acids (LTA), and bacterial olygodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) [24] [25] [26] , hence these bacteria may be a potential adjuvant for vaccination. In fact, there is evidence that orally administered L. casei strains show adjuvant effects [27, 28] . In the present study, however, simple mixing of the bacterial cells with the antigen was not enough to bring about adjuvanticity. This result suggests that the location of the antigen is critical to the adjuvant effect of the antigen delivery vehicle. However, there is evidence that flagellin conjugated to polyacryl starch microparticles was less immunogenic than the free form of flagellin [20] , which indicates that the location of the antigen is not the single factor increasing immunogenicity. Therefore, the adjuvant effect of the recombinant L. casei expressing FliC is probably due to a combination of the immune-stimulating activity of the bacterial cell components and the antigen's physical location.",

Contrary to our expectation, neither provided clear protection against SE. The recombinant L. plantarum produced a higher amount of FliC than L. casei, but the frequency of the cell-surface antigen was lower than L. casei (unpublished data).
