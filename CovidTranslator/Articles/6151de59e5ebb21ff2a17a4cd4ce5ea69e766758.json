Goal of the meeting was to discuss recent developments in the understanding of viral entry and dissemination at mucosal surfaces, rationale for designing vaccines to elicit mucosal immune responses by various routes of immunization, and the types of immune responses elicited. Lessons were drawn from existing vaccines against viral mucosal infections, from the recent failure of the Merck Ad5/HIV vaccine and from attempts at mucosal immunization against SIV. This report summarizes the main concepts and conclusions that came out of the meeting.",

            "text": "The mucosal immune system, especially in the genital and gastrointestinal tract, is an important target for both the HIV infection and development of HIV vaccines. Excluding parenteral transmission, virtually all HIV-1 infections are acquired across a mucosal surface such as the anorectal mucosa, vaginal mucosa or, less frequently, the oral mucosa. The mucosal immune system, particularly the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) in the genital tract and the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALTs), represent the most important target for HIV-1 replication, reservoir establishment and lymphoid tissue destruction [1] . Prospects for designing HIV-1 vaccines to elicit protective mucosal immunity against HIV at site of infection were discussed at the joint ANRS-NIH meeting on 28-30 October 2007 in Veyrier du Lac, France, in light of state-of-the-art knowledge on the mucosal immune system and its specific characteristics, the biology of virus entry and lessons to be learnt from vaccines developed against other human mucosal infections. Participants of this timely meeting were under the impact of the recently announced interruption of the STEP and Phambili trials of the Merck Adenovirus (Ad5)/HIV vaccine, and were eager to discuss concepts and methodological issues in the field of HIV-1 vaccinology.",

Thus, immunization by the oral route induces mucosal immunity both in the upper part of the intestine and the mammary glands, but not in the lower part of the gut; immunization by the nasal route induces a mucosal immune response both in the respiratory tract and the female genital tract; immunization by the rectal route only induces mucosal immunity in the rectum and lower part of the gut; and immunization by the vaginal route only induces mucosal immunity in the vagina. Holmgren and colleagues have been investigating the potential of sublingual (s.l.) immunization for induction of mucosal immune responses. They have shown that s.l. administration of a prototype antigen together with cholera toxin adjuvant induces a broad range of immune responses in lung tissues and in systemic organs [3] . More recently they have demonstrated responses in the respiratory, gastrointestinal and genital tracts as well as systemically following s.l. immunization.",

Live vaccines must achieve a delicate balance between over-attenuation and under-attenuation to be effective yet safe. In addition, the oral vaccines may be less immunogenic in tropical countries due to a variety of reasons, from higher prevalence of intestinal helminth infections, vitamin A and Zn 2+ deficiencies impairing gut restoration, to possible immune exhaustion by intestinal flora. Non-live mucosal vaccines require an appropriate adjuvant for eliciting strong immune responses. This is still a major hurdle as Cholera toxin (CT) and E. coli heat-labile toxin (LT) are the two most potent mucosal adjuvants that help induce T cell responses, but they remain too toxic to be used as such in human vaccines. Efforts are being made to engineer less toxic forms of these adjuvants. CpG linked to CTB subunit has shown promise and induces good chemokine responses. Fabienne Anju\u00e8re (University of Nice, Nice, France) also reported that several approaches are currently in progress to induce mucosal CTL responses against a protein antigen by topical, intravaginal or sublingual administration, using the B subunit of CT (CTB) co-linked to the protein antigen and to a CpG oligodeoxynucleotide [4] .",

Tissue specificity is under the control of chemokines and homing receptors present in the mucosal tissue. For instance, as reported by Rodrigo Mora (Mass General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA), T cells are instructed to express gut-homing receptors integrin \u24234\u24247 and chemokine receptor CCR9 when they are activated by dendritic cells (DCs) from the GALT (gut DCs) but not by DCs from other tissues. The ability of gut DCs to imprint gut-tropism on T cells (and B cells) lies in their ability to produce and store retinoic acid (RA), a vitamin A metabolite [5, 6] . Simple stimulation of T cells with an anti-CD3 antibody in the presence of RA can induce the expression of gut-homing receptors. The ability of gut DCs to secrete RA is probably a consequence of their intimate contact with intestinal epithelial cells, which also can metabolize vitamin A into RA. Interestingly, RA also synergizes with IL-6 or IL-5 to induce IgA-ASC. Thus GALT-DC and RA shape gut mucosal immunity.",

The intestinal epithelial cells are tightly integrated into the mucosal immune system and most DCs in mucosal tissues are educated by the surrounding epithelial cells to suppress inflammation and promote immunological tolerance. The uneducated DCs, which are recruited from Peyer's patches and blood in response to a pathogen's attack, initiate inflammation and trigger an active immune response to the invader. The mucosal immune system therefore has the difficult task of maintaining the fragile balance between the activation of specific immune responses to fight harmful pathogens and their suppression to avoid undesired immune reactions to self or to harmless antigens such as those usually present in the intestinal lumen [7] .",

Contrary to general belief, resident epithelial tissue DCs, including LCs, are not responsive for T cell priming and in fact induce peripheral tolerance. Only DCs newly recruited into muco-cutaneous tissues by danger signals provided by pathogens or adjuvants directly induce priming and differentiation of CD8 + T cells into cytolytic effector T cells in vivo. Recent advancements in knowledge of the dynamics and function of epithelial tissue DCs have provided the basis for the screening of novel T cell adjuvants like DNFB, the measles virus NP protein, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, flagellin and cholera toxin, that can elicit CD8 + T cell cross-priming in the absence of CD4 + T cell help by increasing CCL20 production in epithelial cells and promote CCR6dependent recruitment of DC into epithelia [8] .",

Knockout mice that lack both secretory IgA (SIgA) and SIgM exhibit decreased resistance to cholera toxin and pathogen colonization in the gut, but show a compensatory increase in the number and cytotoxic activity of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), which are the cellular arm of mucosal immunity. IELs are not only involved in anti-microbial defence but also are major effectors of oral tolerance [10, 11] through the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-\u2424 that maintain the state of tolerance. Of note is the fact that mucosal CD4 + CD25 high Foxp3 + T reg cells are significantly increased in number in the intestinal mucosa of HIV-1-infected patients, who also show elevated intestinal IgA levels [12] . Both parameters levels become normalized after initiation of antiretroviral therapy. As discussed by Thomas Schneider (La Charit\u00e9, Berlin, Germany), this probably reflects the involvement of mucosal homeostatic mechanisms that operate in the gut of AIDS patients in response to opportunistic infections.",

The architecture of the mucosal epithelium actually dictates the mechanisms of HIV transmission. M cell transfer and transcytosis are the main routes of HIV penetration across the simple columnar epithelium that lines the endocervix, rectum and gastro-intestinal tract [14] [15] [16] [17] . Importantly, mucosal epithelial cell transcytosis and tissue entry are substantially inhibited by antibodies such as 2F5, underscoring the potential for vaccine-induced inhibition of mucosal HIV-1 infection, as reported at the meeting by Philip Smith (University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL, USA).",

Genital macrophages expressing CD4 and CCR5 also rapidly take up HIV, support its replication, and amplify infection of genital CD4 + T cells. At the same time, replication of the virus initiates a local innate immune response from the resident DCs, which secrete IFN-\u2423 and -\u2424 and MIP-1\u2424 that are meant to control viral replication.

They have established an elegant mucosal explant model to dissect out the sequence of events and the cell types involved. Intestinal mucosa, ECs and DCs seem to take up the virus as early as 15 min after inoculation. He also summarized the differences in tissue architecture and receptor expression between various mucosal sites suggesting different mechanisms of entry at these sites. The intestine, rectum, colon and endocervix are lined with monostratifed columnar epithelial cells, whereas the vagina, ectocervix and anus are lined with squamous epithelium. Intestinal macrophages, contrary to vaginal macrophages, express CD4 but not CCR5 or CXCR4 and do not support infection by or replication of R5 (or X4) virus. Inability to replicate HIV-1 in these cells is not due exclusively to the lack of second receptor expression [21] . In contrast, CD4 + T lymphocytes in the gut lamina propria that express CCR5 and CXCR4, are the earliest and major targets of HIV (or SIV) infection. This results in a rapid and extensive depletion of memory T cells in the GALT [1, [22] [23] [24] . Furthermore, analysis of lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs of SIV infected Chinese rhesus macaques infected by SIV for more than 5 years has shown that the mesenteric lymph nodes constitute the main virus reservoir [25] .",

            "text": "HIV-1 infection has been shown to rapidly induce enteropathy with bowel inflammation and increased gut permeability. It has been proposed that the disruption of the gut mucosal barrier functions allows for the translocation of microbes and microbial products such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the body interior, resulting in a chronic systemic immune activation/T cell exhaustion that fuels HIV disease progression [1, 26] . Interestingly, as reported by Guido Silvestri (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA), SIV infection in its natural hosts (sooty mangabeys, African green monkeys) does not result in systemic CD4 + T-cell depletion in spite of high levels of persistent virus replication. The natural non-pathogenic state also is associated with a rapid depletion of CD4 + T cells in the gut and in the respiratory tract that is similar in magnitude to that observed in pathogenic HIV/SIV infections [27, 28] . However, the depletion occurs in the context of limited enteric pathology and does not lead to systemic immune activation. The early depletion of gut CD4 + T cells either recuperates with recruitment of more CD4 + T cells, or achieves a homeostatic balance with a very low level of immune stimulation to maintain a non-pathogenic status in these natural hosts. Of relevance may be the observation that SIV-infected sooty mangabeys keep an intact gut Th17 + CD4 + T cell population, which is known to play a protective role against infections, whereas SIV-infection of rhesus macaques and HIV-1 infection of humans results in depletion of Th17 + CD4 + cells in the GALT. The loss of Th17 + CD4 + T cells in the gut might be the key to the chronic immune activation seen in SIV and HIV infection.",

These studies demonstrate that the first barrier to virus penetration is cervico-vaginal mucus, which impairs diffusion of the virus into the crypts of the endocervix. Penetrating virions could be observed within 4 h in interstitial spaces between differentiated squamous epithelial cells as well as in the sub-basal milieu of the columnar endocervical epithelium where they co-localized with both LCs and CD4 + T cells. Viral replication in macaques infected by intravaginal inoculation of SIV was also studied by Ashley Haase (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA), who has developed a vaginal infection model to study early events and systemic dissemination of virus and how it exploits the local innate response that brings in susceptible host cells to fuel the expansion and spread of infection locally and distally. He suggested that the mucosal barrier was very effective in limiting initial infection that occurred because of a breach in this protective barrier and was initially limited to only a very small number of local foci in the submucosa. This triggered a local inflammatory response characterized by an influx of CD123 + pDCs that secrete IFN-\u2423, IFN-\u2424 and MIP-1\u2424 which subsequently signals the influx of CCR5 + T cells which fuel the progressive expansion and spread of infection. The infection remains localized from a few hours up to 2 days before spreading to draining internal iliac lymph nodes by days 3-5, and to the spleen and other lymph nodes by days 8-12. In rectal infections this may even be shorter because of disrupted epithelial surfaces. Thus, to interrupt HIV infection and expansion, vaccine strategies need to be effective at the earliest stages of mucosal infection and the immune system must be capable of responding rapidly to curtail the establishment of a self-propagating infection [30, 31] .",

It was recognized that neutralizing intestinal SIgA antibodies are a correlate of immunity for enteric virus infections. As reported by Morgane Bomsel (Institut Cochin, Paris, France), mucosal IgA antibodies specific for the HIV-1 envelope have been shown to block mucosal HIV entry in vitro. Highly exposed, IgG-seronegative (HESN) women, who have repeated unprotected sex with HIV + partners but remain seronegative, have been shown to harbour SIgAs specific for conserved determinants of HIV envelope gp41 in their cervicovaginal secretions. These SIgAs can block CD4 + T cell infection in vitro as well as transcytosis of the virus through epithelial barriers. A library of IgA monoclonal antibodies was derived from cervical B cells of a HESN woman donor. Screening of the resulting clones provided some monoclonal antibodies that were targeted to the gp41 heptad repeats while others were targeted to the 35 C-terminal amino acid peptide (P1) in the gp41 membrane proximal external region (MPER). Both categories of monoclonal antibodies were able to block HIV-1 transcytosis in a cross-clade fashion, and IgA Fab fragments neutralized R5 clade B HIV-1 isolates in macrophage as well as CD4 + T cell assays. Interestingly, their conversion into IgG Fab was accompanied by loss of neutralizing activity. Conversely, the conversion of the 2F5 IgG monoclonal antibody [32] into an IgA Fab increased its neutralizing potency and conferred the antibody with potent transcytosis-blocking activity.",

However, there are several challenges to obtaining reliable quantitation of mucosal IgAs, as discussed by Pamela Kozlowski (Louisiana State University, New Orleans, LA, USA). IgA measurements often give high background due to high glycosylsation of IgA, which makes these molecules \"sticky.\" The quantification of IgA antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) in biopsy samples of mucosal tissue would be optimal, but is often unpractical. Measuring the proportion of IgA antibodysecreting cells in blood is easier, but does not determine the number of IgA lymphoblasts destined for a specific mucosal site. The analysis of antibody in secretions collected from mucosal surfaces at which viral exposure most often occurs is more informative. However, collection methods for mucosal secretions clearly need to be standardized. Collection of secretions with an absorbent Weck-Cel sponge seems to be far superior to collection by lavage/wash [33] .

When they compared functional activity of CTL at sites proximal or distal to the site of immunization, intrarectal vs subcutaneous, both routes of immunization in mice induced tetramer binding T cells in the gut mucosa. However, IR immunization was much better at inducing IFN-gamma-secreting cells at that mucosal site, and more DCs and IL-12 producing DCs were found proximal to the site of immunization.

This concept is highly relevant to HIV vaccines, reinforcing the need to understand mucosal trafficking pathways that can be used for optimal prime/boost vaccine strategies to induce both antibodies and CD8 + T cells with high avidity and broad anti-viral activities to target and protect the multiple HIV-susceptible mucosal tissues [44] .",

Denise Nardelli-Haeflinger (CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland), reviewed the development of VLPs to efficiently prevent genital infection by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11, which cause anogenital warts, and HPV 16 and 18, the leading cause of cancer of the cervix [47] [48] [49] . HPVs are strictly epitheliotropic and thus protective immunization requires the induction of neutralizing antibodies in ano-genital secretions. The three VLP intramuscular immunization regimens readily induced an elevated level of anti-HPV neutralizing IgGs at the uterine cervix. The level of antibody however decreased several fold at the time of ovulation and this may theoretically impact on the long-term efficacy of the vaccine. It also confirms the suggestion that an HIV vaccine regimen will need to consider the reproductive hormonal fluctuations in women to obtain protection across mucosal barrier by systemic immunization. SIgA titers, on the other hand, do not decline during ovulation. Although it has proven difficult in practice to stimulate strong SIgA immune responses and protection by mucosal administration of antigens, intranasal immunization is known to induce SIgA antibody responses in the airways and in the female genital tract [49] [50] [51] [52] . This prompted an attempt at vaccinating women against genital HPV infection by aerosol administration of the current VLP vaccine [53] . It will be important to study the intranasal route of immunization in the development of HIV vaccines, which will also help elucidate as to whether mucosal immunization is required to achieve sustained protection at mucosal sites of infection.",

In the rotavirus gnotobiotic piglet model, as discussed by Linda Saif (Ohio State University, Wooster, OH, USA), initial vaccine priming must take place by the oral route with a live attenuated vaccine to be effective. However, subsequent boosting immunizations can efficiently be achieved with a non-replicating vaccine such as VLPs administered by the nasal route or DNA immunization by the intramuscular route. These prime-boost strategies induce high levels of intestinal neutralizing SIgAs and memory B cells which are the two major correlates of protection. In regards to HIV vaccination, the lesson suggests in the rotavirus model suggests that the effective strategy employed will need to optimally prime for an immune response at multiple mucosal sites (genitourinary and rectal). Boosting assists not only in amplifying and inducing a memory response, but multiple boosts were shown to provide protection against genetically divergent rotavirus strains. Finally, the requirement for inducing neutralizing antibodies at the mucosal surfaces will be critically important because HIV-1 has been shown to infect and disseminate faster than the time required to initiate a productive CD8 CTL recall response.",

As a general rule, potential HIV vaccine candidates are tested in a NHP model before clinical trials are carried out. Differences between rhesus macaques of Indian and Chinese origin, as well as between SHIV and SIV strains used in the various NHP studies, often make direct comparison between studies impossible. As pointed out by David Watkins (AIDS Vaccine Research Laboratories, Madison, WI, USA), the Merck Ad5/HIV vaccine went to clinical trials after it had shown protection in a NHP model. However, all protected macaques in the study were Mamu-A*01 positive, an haplotype related to spontaneous control of SIV infection, and the challenge used a SHIV strain whose HIV sequences exactly matched those in the Ad5 recombinant vaccine. When an Ad5/SIV vaccine was eventually tested in macaques against a SIVmac239 challenge, most of the animals were not protected from infection or disease progression [61, 62] .",

Importantly, vaccines based on SIVmac which do not reduce viral replication by 1.5 logs in such a setting should not go forward to phase IIb trials [64, 65] . Also, as an effective HIV vaccine will need to provide protection against globally diverse isolates of HIV-1, demonstrating protection against a heterologous virus challenge becomes a major point to consider.",

The virus is transported from primary infected DCs to target T cells within 1-4 h after infection, and dissemination of infection to the local lymph nodes takes perhaps 3-4 days or even less, depending on the route of infection. These time periods need to be compared to the known 3-5 days it takes for the reawakening of memory immune responses in a vaccinated individual. Therefore, a strong persistent neutralizing antibody response to prevent HIV infection or at least reduce potential infectious virions at mucosal surfaces is still desperately needed whereas potent specific antiviral mucosal T cell responses will be required to prevent viral dissemination.",

Would sublingual or intranasal routes of immunization be advantageous in that regard? Would repeated local (vaginal or rectal) booster immunizations be of help?

These are critically and urgently needed for evaluating mucosal immunity in an accurate and reliable fashion to compare responses of multiple HIV vaccines on a global scale. Perhaps one of the most frequently heard observations that came out of this meeting was that standard T cell assays such as IFN-\u2425 ELISPOT, ICS and/or proliferation assays, done in PBMC, were not predictors of protective immunity. A recent report by Ron Desrosiers' group well illustrates the point: potent protection against SIV challenge can be provided by live attenuated SIV infection in the absence of strong anti-SIV immune responses in the peripheral blood, whereas, on the opposite, high-magnitude anti-SIV immune responses in peripheral blood provided by DNA prime and recombinant poxvirus or adenovirus boosts provided little or no protection against similar challenge [66] . Similarly, CD8 + T cells responses identified by IFN-\u2425 ELISPOT or IFN-\u2425/TNF-\u2423 intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assays using a single high concentration of peptides and PBMC-derived T cell populations often failed to predict the recognition of cells infected with escape variant viruses [62] .",

The accurate assessment of the antiviral activity of HIV-specific CTLs therefore becomes a crucial step in the evaluation of vaccine potency [67] . Thus, the use of viral suppression assays to test the functionality of T cells, attempts at identifying the T cell populations associated with control of infection in SIV and HIV controllers, as well as the study of T cell transcriptome and proteosome profiles, as advocated by Rafik Sekaly (CANVAC, Montreal, Canada), should be areas for future active investigation [39] [40] [41] [42] . It also would be important to study the breadth and avidity of virus-specific IgAs and IgGs and to develop standardized assays to validate their functionality, whether viral transcytosis-blocking or virus-neutralization assays. The identification of reliable correlates of protection against mucosal HIV-1 infection remains at this time more than ever the number one quest in HIV vaccinology.",
