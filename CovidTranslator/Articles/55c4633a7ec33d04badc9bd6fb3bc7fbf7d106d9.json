The specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) (designated as 8F 8 A 8 H 4 2H 7 ) against GL was produced with the immunogen GL-BSA conjugate. The dissociation constant (K d ) value of the MAb was approximately 9.96\u00d710 \u221210 M. The cross reactivity of the MAb with glycyrrhetic acid was approximately 2.6%. The conventional indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) and simplified icELISA adapted with a modified procedure were established using the MAb. The IC 50 value and the detect range by the conventional icELISA were 1.1 ng mL \u22121 and 0.2-5.1 ng mL \u22121 , respectively. The IC 50 value and the detect range by the simplified icELISA were 5.3 ng mL \u22121 and 1.2-23.8 ng mL \u22121 , respectively. The two icELISA formats were used to analyze GL contents in the roots of wild licorice and different parts of cultivated licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch). The results obtained with the two icELISAs agreed well with those of the HPLC analysis. The correlation coefficient was more than 0.98 between HPLC and the two icELISAs. The two icELISAs were shown to be appropriate, simple, and effective for the quality control of raw licorice root materials.",

It has anti-viral [1, 2] , anti-inflammatory [3] , anti-carcinogenesis [4, 5] , anti-hepatitis [6] [7] [8] , anti-thrombotic [9] , and immunomodulatory [10] activities. Its antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus has recently been demonstrated in vitro [11, 12] . GL is also used as food additive and masking agent in pharmaceutical products because of its sweet taste (170 times sweeter than sucrose) [13] .",

The quality of the raw herbs used in the CPMs affects the final therapeutic outcomes and consumer safety. An effective method is needed to screen large numbers of licorice root samples for the quality control. Existing methods for the determination of GL include high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [14, 15] , liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-ITMS) [16] , capillary electrophoresis [17] , near-infrared spectroscopy [18] , immunosensor [19] , immunoassay [13, [20] [21] [22] , and micellar electrokinetic chromatography [23] . Compared to conventional instrumental methods, immunoassay is a rapid and sensitive method which needs small quantities of test materials and simple pretreatments. There are reports of ELISAs based on monoclonal antibody (MAb) against GL [13, 24] . The MAb was obtained from GL-BSA synthesized by the NaIO 4 method. The ELISA reported by Mizutani et al. [13] had a detect range of 20-200 ng mL \u22121 . Here, we report a new ultra-sensitive and specific immunoassay by using a new GL MAb. A conventional indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) and a simplified icELISA were developed for the determination of GL in different licorice samples.",

One week after the third injections, mice were eye-bled and sera were tested for anti-GL antibody titer and for GL recognition properties in icELISA. Three days after the last injection in adjuvant, mouse with the highest titer and best specificity was boosted intraperitoneally with 0.1 mg GL-BSA conjugate in 0.1 mL PBS and was used for the fusion. The spleen cells collected from the mouse were fused with the SP2/0 (obtained from China Institute of Veterinary Drug Control, Beijing, China) cell line using PEG-2000 at a ratio of 10:1 of spleen to myeloma cells. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a CO 2 incubator (5% CO 2 in air). Selective growth of the hybrid cells in the DMEM supplemented with HAT. Seven days after fusion, the supernatant was tested by icELISA. Positive hybridomas were cloned by limiting dilution and clones were further selected by icELISA.",

            "text": "Glycyrrhizic acid is a marker of quality for Glycyrrhiza materials. Mizutani et al. [13] reported a MAb-based ELISA for the analysis of GL. The immunogen was synthesized by the NaIO 4 method. The polysaccharide residue in the glucuronic acid molecules is specifically oxidized at adjacent hydroxyl residues leaving reactive aldehyde groups. Reductive animation proceeds between the aldehyde group(s) and free amino group(s) of the protein. In our study, the MAb was derived with an immunogen (GL-BSA) conjugated by the active ester method. The two new icELISAs are approximately 20-to 100-fold more sensitive than that reported by Mizutani et al. [13] . The results showed that our immunogen evoked a highquality antibody against GL. Three of four hybrid clones which secreted anti-GL MAb in the previous report showed more than 18% cross reactivity with glycyrrhetinic acid [22] , whereas, MAb 8F 8 A 8 H 4 2H 7 showed only 2.6% cross reactivity. In general, there is some correlation between the position in the hapten molecule used for the conjugation to carrier protein and the recognition of epitopes on the hapten by the prepared antibodies. The epitopes distant from the site of conjugation tend to be well recognized by antibodies, whereas epitopes neighboring the coupling site tend to be less well recognized [27] . There are three carboxyl groups in the GL molecule. Thus, it is proposed that the carboxyl group in its aglycon, but not the carboxyl groups in the two glucuronic acid molecules, was connected with the free amino group on the carrier protein (Fig. 1c) . However, the hypothesis needs further study to be verified.",
