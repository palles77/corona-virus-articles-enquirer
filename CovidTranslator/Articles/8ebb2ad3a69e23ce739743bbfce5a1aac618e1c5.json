In this paper, we investigate the effects of three forms of awareness (i.e., contact, local, and global) on the spread of a disease in a random network. Connectivity-correlated transmission rates are assumed. By using the mean-field theory and numerical simulation, we show that both local and contact awareness can raise the epidemic thresholds while the global awareness cannot, which mirrors the recent results of Wu et al. The obtained results point out that individual behaviors in the presence of an infectious disease has a great influence on the epidemic dynamics. Our method enriches mean-field analysis in epidemic models.",

Human responses to disease outbreaks are sometimes decisive factors. For example, when aware of a disease in their vicinity, people can take precautionary measures such as wearing masks, frequent hand washing, and evading contact with infected individuals to reduce the risk of infection and lower the possibility of disease transmission [3] [4] [5] . The behavioral change triggered in a population corresponds to the information obtained from the circumstances [6] . The information taken from a social or spatial neighborhood is called local information, while information that comes from the news media and public health authorities is called Y.

Global and local awareness were described by exponential functions of respective global and local information. By using a mean-field approximation, it was shown that the network topology, homogeneous random network or scale-free network, has an intrinsic impact on the existence of a critical value (in terms of global and local awareness) that stops the epidemics. In [9] , a third kind of awareness, called contact awareness, which increases with the individual contact number, was proposed. By using a linear formulation of awareness, the authors showed that both the local and contact awareness can raise the epidemic threshold (hence, inhibit the epidemic from spreading), while the global awareness cannot. The precise functioning of awareness, nevertheless, is still not well understood. One of the goals in this paper is to understand the role of the aforementioned three forms of awareness by providing a more flexible yet analytically tractable framework.",

Our model is based on an SIS epidemiological process where, at a given time, each individual can be susceptible (S) or infected (I). The contact network of the population is modeled by a configuration model (described below) where nodes represent individuals and edges indicate potential contacts between individuals. Building on a continuous meanfield approach and the Lyapunov stability theory, we establish the epidemic dynamics and derive the epidemic threshold. The function of awareness is expressed by a non-linear function (the linear function used in [9, 13] can be viewed as a special case) that provides additional flexibility in applications. Through numerical simulation on scale-free networks, we confirm that both local and contact awareness can raise the epidemic threshold while global awareness can only decrease the final epidemic size. However, the influence degree of the awareness is shown to be closely related to the heterogeneous transmission rates.",

            "text": "We use a modified SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) model to study the epidemic dynamics on a network consisting in n individuals. The contact network is defined as a configuration model [12, 14] , where only the network's degree distribution (that is, the distribution, p k , which governs the probability that a node will have degree k) is specified and the edges are made by random pairing. Configuration model networks are increasingly used for infectious diseases in complex networks, which yield to analytical treatment and allow for heterogeneous contact levels [15] . Data-driven studies reveal that the accuracy of such models is mostly high; see, for example, [16, 17] . In the simplest SIS model, each individual is either in a susceptible state or an infected state. A susceptible individual, say node i, becomes infected upon contact with a single infected individual, say node j, at some infection rate. The infection rate along the edge from j to i can be expressed as A i T j , where A i is the admission rate of node i describing the rate that susceptible node i would actually admit an infection through an edge connected to an infected node and T j is the transmission rate of node j meaning the rate that infected node j would actually transmit an infection through an edge connected to a susceptible node [10, 15] . Once infected, a node recovers (i.e., returns to the susceptible state) at rate \u03b3 .",

As mentioned above, we will consider the degreecorrelated transmission rate \u03b2 k [10] , which is defined as the transmission rate of a node with degree k. In addition, we modulate the admission rate A i by some multiplicative factors. First, let 0 \u2264 \u03c8 k \u2264 1 be a decreasing function, which represents the contact awareness of a node with degree k. Naturally, an individual having a larger contact number has a higher risk of being infected [9] . This factor of contact awareness reflects an individual's risk perception based on the contact information. Second, let 0 \u2264 \u03c6 k \u2264 1 with \u03c6 0 = 1 being a decreasing function accommodating the local and global epidemic information. Specifically, for a node, say i, with degree k, let k inf be the number of its infected neighbors. The local awareness of node i is given by \u03c6 l k = 1 \u2212 \u03b1(k inf /k) \u03b11 for some precaution level, 0 \u2264 a \u2264 1 and \u03b1 1 is a positive integer reflecting the use of special prophylaxis [1] . The quantity \u03c1 is taken to be representative of the global infection density, that is, the fraction of infected individuals over the whole population. The global awareness of a node with degree k is supposed to be \u03c6 g k = 1 \u2212 b\u03c1 \u03b12 with 0 \u2264 b \u2264 1 and \u03b1 2 similarly being a k positive integer. The parameters \u03b1 1 and \u03b1 2 embody the impact strength of the local and global epidemic information on the admission rate. The role of them will be clear in the following. For a susceptible node i with degree k and one of its infected neighbor j, the modified infection rate along the edge from j to i can be written as",

We find that both \u03b2 c and \u03b2 c are almost unchanged for different b, while they increase with a. An intuitive interpretation is that a higher level of precaution measures adopted by individuals (i.e., larger a) can decrease the likelihood of an epidemic outbreak (i.e., larger \u03b2 c and \u03b2 c ). The simulated values are slightly larger than the theoretical predictions, which is likely due to a finite-size effect [9, 10] . We illustrate the epidemic (22) and (23) thresholds for \u03b1 1 = 2, \u03b1 2 = 1 in Fig. 3 and those for \u03b1 1 = 1, \u03b1 2 = 2 in Fig. 4 . We find similar behaviors as observed in Fig. 2 . By comparing Fig. 2 with Fig. 3 and comparing Fig. 2 with Fig. 4 , we see that the epidemic thresholds \u03b2 c and \u03b2 c decrease with \u03b1 1 , while they are almost unchanged for different \u03b1 2 . (The dependency between \u03b2 c (\u03b2 c ) and \u03b1 1 is re-plotted in Fig. 5 for the sake of comparison). These observations agree well with our analytical solutions. The decrease of epidemic thresholds with respect to \u03b1 1 has an important epidemiological implication. Nodes with exposure to many infectious contacts (corresponding to a high value of k inf /k) in a network may fail to be infected due to their increased perception of the risk or safety measures (here, smaller \u03b1 1 ) and thus stopping the epidemic spreading. In the real world, medical doctors and care/sex workers should adopt strong safety measures, which may efficiently contain the disease transmission. A similar phenomenon was observed in Bagnoli et al. [1] for a network with a power-law in-degree distribution and an exponential out-degree distribution using degree-independent transmission rates (corresponding to our Fig. 5a ). The ineffectiveness of factor \u03b1 2 as well as b, nevertheless, indicates the incapability of altering an epidemic threshold for a global influence over the population.",

Our analysis is based on an SIS epidemiological process in random networks modeled by a configuration model.

Our results confirm and further extend the previous observations in [1, 8, 10 ] to more general forms of awareness as well as degree correlated transmission rates. We found that the non-linear effect encoded in parameter \u03b1 1 of local awareness implies that individuals who are exposed to many infectious contacts can effectively contribute to disease control by increasing their awareness of risk.",
