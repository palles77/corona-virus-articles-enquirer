To determine if SARS-CoV-2 is present in sewage during the emergence of COVID-19 in the Netherlands, sewage samples of 7 cities and the airport were tested using RT-PCR against three fragments of the nucleocapsid protein gene (N1-3) and one fragment of the envelope protein gene (E). No SARS-CoV-2 was detected in samples of February 6, three weeks before the first case was reported in the Netherlands on February 27. On March 5, the N1 fragment was detected in sewage of five sites. On March 15/16, the N1 fragment was detected in sewage of six sites, and the N3 and E fragment were detected at 5 and 4 sites respectively. This is the first report of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage. The detection of the virus in sewage, even when the COVID-19 prevalence is low, indicates that sewage surveillance could be a sensitive tool to monitor the circulation of the virus in the population.

            "text": "In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus respiratory disease (called COVID-19) initiated in Wuhan, China. The outbreak was caused by a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak spread from Wuhan to other cities in China and many other countries. WHO declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 , when the disease was reported in 114 countries. 1 The primary mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets that people cough, sneeze or exhale, and may also be spread via fomites. 2 SARS-CoV-2 is 82% similar to SARS coronavirus that caused an outbreak in 2003. 16-73% of patients with SARS were reported to have diarrhea in addition to respiratory symptoms 3 , and transmission of SARS via water droplets from faeces via air ventilation systems in Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong was reported. 4 Diarrhea is also reported in a significant proportion of the COVID-19 cases and recent reports show that SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in stool samples of COVID-19 cases. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] The shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was studied in a cluster of 9 cases and was 10 7 RNA copies/g faeces one week after symptom onset and decreased to 10 3 RNA copies/g three weeks after symptom onset. 10 In stool samples with high RNA copies, viable SARS-CoV-2 was detected. 11 Although it is unlikely that wastewater will become an important transmission pathway for coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 12 , increasing circulation of the virus in the population will increase the virus load into the sewer systems of our cities. It is important to collect information about the occurrence and fate of this new virus in sewage to understand if there is no risk to sewage workers, but also to determine if sewage surveillance 13 could be used to monitor the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in our communities, that could complement current clinical surveillance, which is limited to the COVID-19 patients with the most severe symptoms. Sewage surveillance could also serve as early warning of (re-)emergence of COVID-19 in cities, much like the sewage surveillance for poliovirus that has been used for this purpose. 14 The objective of this investigation was to identify if SARS-CoV-2 is present in domestic wastewater of cities and a main airport during the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Netherlands.",

This IC-RNA consists of an in vitro transcribed RNA fragment with a length of 412 bases derived from dengue virus type 2 and was synthesized as previously described. 18 RT-PCR analyses using primers IC-F (5\u00b4-ATGACAGCCACTCCTCCG-3\u00b4), IC-R (5\u00b4-GGAACGAACCAAACAGTCTTC-3\u00b4) and probe IC-P (5\u00b4-TexasRed-AGCAGAGACCCATTCCCTCAGAGC-BHQ-3\u00b4) were used to detect a dengue virus fragment (length: 149 bp) in order to control the performance of RNA-extraction, RT-PCR and to detect the presence of inhibitors. High-resolution automatic electrophoresis was performed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using Agilent 1000 DNA Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) to analyse the length of the PCR-products.

Initial trials showed inhibition of the RT-PCR reactions, that could be reduced to a large extend by the addition of BSA to the reaction mixture. The results of the samples of February 6, 2020, three weeks before the first case was reported in The Netherlands on Feb 27, showed no positive signals for primer sets N1-3 and E ( Table 3 ). The samples of March 4 and 5, one week into the epidemic with 38 and 82 COVID-19 cases reported through the health surveillance system, respectively 19 , showed a positive signal for the N1 primer/probe set in sewage samples of four of the 6 WWTP sampled. In sewage samples of March 15 and 16, 6 of the 7 WWTP showed a positive signal with N1, and in addition 5 WWTP also with N3 and 4 WWTP with the E primer/probe set. High throughput electrophoresis confirmed that the length of the PCR products match the length of the PCR target gene fragments. N1 appears to be the most sensitive primer/probe set of the sets tested here, followed by N3 and E for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage. For clinical samples, the US FDA reported the sensitivity of the primer/probe sets of N1=N3>N2 on SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 20 which partially matches with our results in sewage samples. The detection of fragments of two genes of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage of multiple WWTP and the temporal pattern of detection that aligns with the emergence of the epidemic in the Netherlands provide compelling evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is detected in sewage.",

The latter was estimated from the capacity (in inhabitant equivalents) of each of the WWTP. The prevalence at the airport could not be estimated, as the number of COVID-19 cases were not reported for this denominator. This yielded a rough estimate of the prevalence, since the service areas of WWTP do not precisely overlap with the city boundaries. Also, there was some delay in notification of cases by the local health authorities to the national surveillance system which could mean that the actual prevalence was slightly higher than reported. Moreover, the reported prevalence are the data from cases with COVID-19 as confirmed by laboratory diagnosis; a significant proportion of COVID-19 goes undetected, since people with mild symptoms are not tested. A study among healthcare workers in two hospitals in the Netherlands indicated that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating undetected in the community prior to February 27, when the first COVID-19 case was reported, suggesting that there is a high prevalence of mild COVID-19 in the community. 22 The detection of N1 in WWTP Amersfoort on March 5, when no cases were reported in Amersfoort, also suggests virus circulation in the population before COVID-19 cases are reported through the health surveillance system. Comparing Tables 3 and 4 shows that the N1 primer/probe set started to produce a signal in sewage samples when the observed COVID-19 prevalence was around or even below 1.0 case in 100,000 people and the N3 and E set started to yield positive signals when the observed prevalence was 3.5 case per 100,000 people or more, although not consistently, since sewage from WWTP Amersfoort did not yield positive results with set N3 and E. Given the roughness of the prevalence estimates, these numbers are indicative, but do indicate that sewage surveillance with the method used in this study is sensitive. However, reliable quantification of SARS-CoV-2 with RT-qPCR in sewage will be required to make reliable surveillance feasible. Therefore, the development of controls to consistently monitor coronavirus recovery and to measure viral RNA yield and check for RT-PCR inhibition is of great importance. The analyses of an added quantified suspension of another human coronavirus (such as 229E) 23 to the sewage samples can potentially be used as an easy control to make reliable quantification possible. Also, digital droplet PCR could aid in the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in water, as shown for other RNA viruses. 24 The detection of the virus in sewage, even when the COVID-19 prevalence is low, indicates that sewage surveillance could be used to monitor the circulation of the virus in the population and as early warning tool for increased circulation in the coming winter or unaffected populations.
