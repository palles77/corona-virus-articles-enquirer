Approximately 400 male and female calves less than 2 months of age were housed without any age-related order in individual hutches. The problem appeared in calves less than one month of age, although a more precise age at onset could not be determined initially. Examination of calves clinically and at necropsy failed to identify common etiologic agents known to cause diarrhea and/or death in calves. At that point in the investigation it was believed that a better understanding of overall patterns of calf disease on this dairy would help define possible predisposing factors and causes of the neonatal mortality. Consequently, examination of records was undertaken to describe age-specific mortality and to test if certain management practices and/or host characteristics were associated with death.",

Contemporary cohorts, defined as all calves present for any of the neonatal period during the month of interest, were examined at the time of the outbreak to provide a current estimate of age-specific mortality. Birth cohorts were followed to measure actual age-specific survival using data that became available during and after the outbreak. These measures of actual mortality provided confirmation of estimates from contemporary cohorts made earlier, and permitted a prospective assessment of control efforts.

The s i was calculated from the matrix as n /2 where n was the number of days in the month. Consideration of animals lost-to-follow-up was not made in computation of cumulative proportions because all calves, even male calves, were retained up to 28 days of age. This method used data available at the onset of the investigation for contemporary calves present during December and permitted examination of estimated age-specific mortality (l-P/) up to 28 days of age. Table II presents computations of si and Pi for female calves less than 29 days of age that were present during the month of December. For December the mortality rate was estimated to be 10.7% (1--0.893) for females and 5.3% for males (data not shown). The age-specific survival rates indicated that calves of both sexes would begin to die at about 9 days of age, but females suffered more severely as demonstrated by the continued decline in survival (Fig. 1) . Although examination of the contemporary cohort did not provide actual mortality rates, it did provide early estimates from which some general appreciation was gathered for age and sex as possible factors associated with mortality. Actual measures of survivorship could not be obtained until calves had been observed from birth to 28 days of age. The birth cohort life table method was used to measure actual mortality in calves born during December and followed through to 28 days of age. It was possible to pursue a birth cohort analysis because sufficient data were available to permit follow-up of a large number of calves from birth to 28 days of age. Cumulative proportions of calves surviving were computed as for the contemporary cohort.",

It was possible to examine for these effects because individuals who provided perinatal care to calves born on a given day of the week were designated to do so by a work schedule which remained unchanged during December and January. Rates were calculated for each of the 7 week days as (number of calves born on day-of-the-week m and that died within the first 28 days of life) + (number of calves born on day-of-the-week m). The denominator was derived from the matrix by summing numbers in R cells for the one-day-of-age column corresponding to the day-of-the-week m. The numerator was a sum of numbers in the D cells which followed a birth cohort along the diagonal from the day of birth to 28 days of age. Calves born after December and January were followed into January and February (not shown in Table I ) before the numerator could be defined. Day-of-the-week mortality rates for calves born in December and January are given in Table III . Table IV presents relative risks of mortality for calves born on each of the 7 days computed from rates in Table III . The risk of a calf dying within 28 days of age was 11 times greater if it was born on a Wednesday than on Saturday. The 95% confidence interval did not include 1.0 (1.46, 84.49) indicating that the way in which newborn calves were managed on those days exerted a sizable influence on subsequent survival in those calves. High risks of death were seen also for calves born on Thursdays and Fridays, relative to Saturdays. Two possible explanations were found for the difference between rates for Wednesdays and Saturdays. New bedding was spread in the maternity corral only during the days Monday to Friday, and usually on Thursdays or Fridays, Provision for a cleaner environment to calves born on weekends, compared to those born midweek, could have enhanced their survival. Another explanation was that the eldest of the calf handlers, who appeared less willing to feed good quality colostrum to calves, did not work on weekends. Consequently, calves born on Saturdays may have received more protection from infectious agents and, thus, experienced greater survival. Because the factors of bedding and calf-handler on day of birth, either independently or in combination, appeared to be highly associated with neonatal mortality, changes were made in bedding and colostrum management. It is believed that these changes contributed to improved survivorship observed in subsequent months (Fig. 3) .",
