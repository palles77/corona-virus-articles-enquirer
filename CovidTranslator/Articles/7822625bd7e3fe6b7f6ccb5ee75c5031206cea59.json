When this pH is raised, by exposing the retinas to weak bases like ammonium chloride, the terminals exhibit large, membrane-delimited compartments, many of which accumulate endocytic tracers. This effect is partly reversed when the weak bases are removed. We infer that among the acidified structures within the terminals are endocytic compartments with at least some of the characteristics of the endosomes that participate in receptor-mediated endocytosis in other cell types.",

The most prominent of such activities is the retrieval of membrane added to the cell surface by the fusion of synaptic vesicles during transmitter release; the retrieved membrane eventually regenerates synaptic vesicles (Holtzman et al., 1971; Heuser & Reese, 1973; Ceccarelli et al., 1973;  for review see Holtzman & Mercurio, 1980; Kelly, 1988; Rash, 1988) . Some nerve terminals also exhibit endocytic uptake of biologically active growth factors, toxins or other molecules (reviewed, e.g. in Hawrot, 1984) by processes that may not be tied to the cycling of membranes during neurotransmission. The tips of growing nerve processes at stages before synapses form can also show considerable endocytosis (reviewed, e.g. in Jacobson, 1978) .",

            "text": "It is not known at present whether endosomes or comparable acidified compartments occur in neurons. However, relatively large endocytic compartments, that could be endosome-related, are easily observed in nerve terminals and elsewhere, both normally and under various experimental conditions. For instance, during retrieval of synaptic vesicle membrane, especially when transmitter release is very intense (Bennett et al., 1976) , when the temperature is low (Heuser & Reese, 1973; Schaeffer & Raviola, 1978) or under some ionic conditions (Liscum et al., 1982) , a considerable proportion of the retrieved membrane can accumulate in intermediate compartments. These are distinguishable from typical synaptic vesicles but are fated eventually to give rise to such vesicles (e.g. Heuser & Reese, 1973; Bennett et al., 1976; Miller & Heuser, 1984) . Depending on system and circumstance the compartments vary in size and other properties. Some are a few tens of nanometres in diameter and thus are not much larger than typical synaptic vesicles. Others are sacs or vacuoles with lengths or diameters of hundreds of nanometres; the term 'cisternae' has sometimes been used to designate such large intermediates in synaptic vesicle recycling. If cisternae do turn out to be endosome-like, an interesting point deserving attention will be that the cycling membrane appears only transiently at the cell surface; in the 'resting' state, the membrane is held in intracellular compartments (synaptic vesicles). In contrast, the membrane cycling in receptor-mediated endocytosis is generally regarded either as in continuous movement between the cell surface and interior compartments, or as membrane that 'resides' at the cell surface but can transiently be internalized (reviewed in Holtzman, 1989) .",

Under normal circumstances endocytic tracers are incorporated chiefly into synaptic vesicles, but some tracer also passes into larger sacs and tubules and vacuolelike 'cisternae' of endocytic origin can become quite prominent under several experimental conditions (Schaeffer & Raviola, 1978; Liscum et al., 1982; Cooper & McLaughlin, 1983) . In the present study we establish that frog photoreceptor terminals contain structures whose pH is below that of the extracellular milieu and we demonstrate that the terminals contain compartments which respond to treatments that raise intracompartmental pH, in a manner similar to the responses of acidified endosomes in other cell types. Our methodology derives from the numerous observations on endosomes and lysosomes indicating that weak bases accumulate selectively in compartments with interior pH values lowei\" than their surroundings (reviewed in Anderson & Orci, 1988; Holtzman, 1989) . Weak base vital dyes ('acidotropic dyes'), including aminoacridine derivatives like Acridine Orange, have been used extensively to stain acidified compartments. Other bases, especially ammonium chloride, have been widely employed to raise intracompartmental pH values, thereby perturbing a variety of phenomena.

The vacuoles were surrounded by a normal-looking population of synaptic vesicles. Vacuoles were more consistently obvious in rod terminals than in cones (see Fig. 8 and Liscum et al., 1982) . The vacuoles were present whether or not the preparations had been exposed to HRP (Angenbraun & Holteman, unpublished observations). In retinas expossed to NH4 C1 and HRP by our routine protocol the majority of the vacuoles were HRP labelled, but unlabelled vacuoles were often present as well. Unlabelled vacuoles were particularly prominent if we omitted the preincubation in HRP we routinely included to permit the tracer to percolate into the regions of the synapses (cf. Schacher et aI., 1976) , and especially if w e exposed the terminals to NH4C1 without HRP before exposing them to NH4C1 with HRP (Fig. 5) . The percentage of labelled synaptic vesicles in NH4C1-HRP exposed retinas varied from experiment to experiment. Sometimes it was markedly less than in the controls but sometimes it approached control levels.",

Our control preparations and our studies on other systems suggest that we face technical problems quite difficult to deal with. Not only are there problems in penetration of the detecting antibodies to the photoreceptor interiors, but we suspect also that we cannot fix DAMP molecules rapidly enough to keep them in place because the retinas are too thick, and the synaptic structures lack a dense enough internal matrix of macromolecules with available amino groups to which DAMP can be attached by the aldehyde fixative.",

In the presence of ammonium chloride or of AO, relatively large vacuoles accumulate. This vacuologenic effect of weak bases like ammonium chloride, at concentrations on the same order as those we use, has long been recognized in various endocytosing, non-neuronal cells (Okhuma & Poole 1981; Cain & Murphy, 1986; Cain et al., 1989) . It is attributed to the accumulation of protonated forms of the bases within acidified compartments. The effect is held to be a result of low membrane permeability to the protonated forms of the bases, which are generated within the compartments because of the low pH: the vacuolation reflects principally the consequent osmotic entry of water (DeDuve, et aI., 1974; Okhuma & Poole, 1981) , probably coupled with alterations in the patterns and relative rates of membrane cycling into and out of the compartments (cf. Holtzman, 1989 ; see also Heuser, 1989) .",

This was true in our system with the two such bases we used, benzylamine and tributylamine, even though these bases did have the expected effect on the pH in the terminals, as judged by AO staining.

Alternatively, our observations may well mean that vacuoles eventually lose their capacity to acquire endocytosed tracers so that at least some of the vacuoles formed before HRP was present did not become labelled. This would parallel the indications in other cell types that endosomes, shortly after they form, cease fusing with newer endocytic structures, probably because the endosomes undergo changes in intrinsic fusion capacities and also move away from the zones of endocytosis (Gruenberg & Howell, 1987; Diaz et al., 1988; reviewed in Holtzman, 1989) .",

This behaviour has previously been reported for cisternae in several systems under other experimental circumstances: the cisternae regenerate synaptic vesicles when conditions are returned to normal (Heuser & Reese, 1973; Miller & Heuser, 1984) . For retina this was first shown by Schaeffer and Raviola (1978) . In these reports, and in our work on retina (present study; Liscum et al., 1982; Mercurio & Holtzman, 1982) the amounts of membrane that accumulate as cisternae represent a surface area sufficient to account for the subsequent regeneration of vesicles. Moreover in the presentwork (Fig. 7) and in several of the other studies (for retina see Schaeffer & Raviola, 1978; Liscum et al., 1982 ; see also Miller & Heuser, 1984) images are encountered which seem to represent synaptic vesicles continuous with the cisternae as if trapped or fixed in the act of budding (or fusing). We see no sign of an increase in the multivesicular bodies and other degradative structures we have previously investigated in the terminals and cell bodies of photoreceptors (Holtzman & Mercurio, 1980; Schmied & Holtzman, 1987) : degradation of the vesicles and other membranes of the terminals seems to be a slow, steady-state process that does not respond markedly to even substantial changes in rates of transmission and associated membrane cycling (cf. Holtzman & Mercurio, 1980) . Still, our findings with the weak bases indicate that the conditions under which vacuoles appear need not block the passage of endocytic label into synaptic vesicles (see e.g. Fig. 4) . For neuromuscular junctions it has been posited that two or more routes by which synaptic vesicle membrane is retrieved can operate simultaneously. One such route may be relatively direct, involving the pinching off of small vesicles from the plasma membrane (cf. also Ceccarelli et al., 1973 and Torri-Tarelli et al., 1987) whereas other routes, more variable, seem to involve intermediate, cisternal-like compartments (Miller & Heuser, 1984) . This would fit well with our present observations. However, with the protocols we have used thus far we Fig. 4 .

Full shaded bars denote weak base exposure, half-shaded bars recovery. Profiles of terminals were scored 0 if they had only one or two labelled synaptic vesicles; + indicates terminals in which several vesicles were labelled but labelled vesicles amounted to less than 1% of the total synaptic vesicle population; + + indicates terminals with 1-5% of the vesicles labelled; + + + terminals with 5-15% of the vesicles labelled; + + + + terminals with greater than 15% of the vesicles labelled. Labelled vacuoles are present along with some labelled synaptic vesicles. (The section selected for this micrograph was somewhat thicker than the ones we routinely use, to aid in illustrating the distribution and abundance of the labelled vacuoles.) x 23 000. r cannot definitively evaluate this model. For example, we cannot adequately evaluate the possible toxic effects of our procedures, or the extent to which traces of HRP might persist in extracellular spaces after the rinses used in our recovery experiments. Thus, we think it premature, for example, to argue against the possibility that the vacuoles we observe are involved in yet-to-be discovered endocytic processes that coexist with the recycling of synaptic vesicles in the photoreceptors.",

But this by no means rules out the possibility that there is something special about the photoreceptors' vacuoles, related perhaps to the cells' use (Massey & Redburn, 1986 ) of acidic amino acids as transmitters. Movements of anions into acidifying compartments can be important in controlling the degree of acidification (reviewed in Mellman et al., 1986; Moriyama & Nelson, 1987; Barasch etal., 1988; Holtzman, 1989 ; see also Stanley et aI., 1988) . Do our experimental conditions exaggerate normal pathways (e.g. enlarging compartments that ordinarily are much smaller), or do they divert endocytosis or recycling into an atypical mode? At present this is an unanswerable question, tied closely to the unresolved general disputes about synaptic vesicle recycling mentioned already. It is, however, easy to find modest-sized endocytic structures that could well be recycling intermediates in photoreceptors and other neurons releasing transmitters under normal stimulation conditions. Cell fractionation studies also suggest that there may be intermediate stages in the regeneration of synaptic vesicles from recycled membrane (Whittaker, 1987) .",

The synaptic vesicles of photoreceptors have not been isolated but the transmitters used probably include glutamate (Massey & Redburn, 1986) . Vesicles from other types of glutamatergic neurons seem to use proton pumps to help store transmitters (Naito & Ueda, 1983; Maycox et al., 1988) . Perhaps in the terminals we study the vesicles use their proton pumping machinery largely to generate a membrane potential rather than a pH gradient, as is the case under some circumstances with secretory bodies in gland cells, or with isolated synaptic vesicles (Johnson, 1987; Barasch et al., 1988; Maycox et al., 1988) . Or it could be that the effects of the small radius of curvature of the vesicles or the formation of multimolecular complexes within them (cf. Sulzer et al., 1987a) counteract expected osmotic effects; these types of explanations have been used to account for previous observations that synaptic vesicles and other small lipoprotein vesicles fail to swell or shrink markedly in response to large osmotic changes (e.g. Holz & Stratford, 1979; Van der Kloot & Spielholz, 1987) .",

However, acidification could also have an impact on the interactions of the constituent molecules of membranes with one another or on the state of aggregation of compartmental contents, and these effects could influence, for example, the recycling and sorting of the membrane molecules (cf. Kelly, 1985; Caplan et al., 1987; Sulzer et al., 1987a; Tooze et al., 1987; Turkewitz et aI., 1988; Chung et aI., 1989) . Or pH might be important for the transmembrane movements of materials -solutes or water -into or out of the vacuoles; key roles have been assigned to osmotic effects and to movements of ions additional to H \u00f7 in controlling the membrane reorganizations involved in exocytosis and in endosome functions (e.g. Harding et al., 1985; Finkelstein et al., 1986) , although the proposals remain controversial (Holz, 1986) .",
