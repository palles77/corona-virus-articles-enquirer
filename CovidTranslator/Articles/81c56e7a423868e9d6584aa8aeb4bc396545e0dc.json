            "text": "The connection between human and animal microbiology was originally recognized by Virchow and Osler in the 19th century. Nonetheless, the relationship has only recently been emphasized through the One Health Initiative, which promotes coequal collaborations between practitioners and researchers in human and comparative medicine, as well as surveillance programs in wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. An important catalytic event for the Initiative was the West Nile virus outbreak in New York City in 1999, where two independent lines of research investigation converged-one focused on high mortality in native corvids (including crows) and exotic birds in the Bronx Zoo that ultimately led to the culture and identification of the virus by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and another focused on human encephalitis cases. These were initially attributed to St. Louis encephalitis virus but found to be West Nile virus when brain material of victims underwent DNA sequence analysis by a team composed of investigators at the University of California and the New York State Department of Health. 1 Retrospective analysis indicated that the cause of the human outbreak would have been ascertained earlier if the veterinary and medical practitioners had collaborated in sharing data and samples. A series of national and international meetings culminated in the One Health Resolution signed by the presidents of the American Medical Association and American Veterinary Medical Association, with endorsement by the Centers for Disease Control, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the European Union.",

The most dramatic examples are diseases associated with the slaughter and consumption of wild animals, also known as bushmeat, such as infections caused by Ebola, Marburg, and monkeypox viruses, as well as SARS, and tularemia. However, less exotic meats are associated with transmission of Salmonella, highly pathogenic Escherichia coli, and prion diseases (e.g., new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease).",

They are divided into two suborders: the Megachiroptera, which include fruit bats and flying foxes, and the Microchiroptera, which include insectivorous and vampire bats. Bats are unique among mammals in their ability to fly, tendency to aggregate at high density, and capacity to harbor a wide range of viruses without apparent disease. The physiology of bats is poorly understood, and their tolerance for persistent infection with viruses that cause fatal disease in other mammals is an enigma. However, this puzzle is likely to be solved with recent investments in bat genomic sequencing and systems biology.",

The route of transmission can vary even for the same virus. Whereas in Malaysia, farm workers became infected with Nipah virus through exposure to pigs that had consumed contaminated droppings of frugiverous bats, in Bangladesh, where pigs are not farmed, human Nipah virus infection has been associated with consumption of palm sap beverages contaminated by bats. In North America, silver-haired bats transmit rabies virus via a bite wound. Humans are typically infected by filoviruses through exposure to infected primate meat; however, there are instances in which infection may have occurred through consumption of infected bats or exposure to bat excreta in close quarters (e.g., caves and abandoned mines). The SARS coronavirus is presumed to have entered the human population through intermediate species (civets) in live-animal markets. We do not yet know the path for human infection of the most recent coronavirus that emerged in the Middle East. Although there are examples of human-to-human transmission of filoviruses and henipaviruses through contact with blood or other bodily fluids, the only bat-associated pathogen that is known to have established efficient transmission within the human population is the SARS coronavirus.",

In concert, these factors, malnutrition, lack of access to or refusal of vaccines, and exposure to contaminated food and water have enabled the emergence and transmission of zoonoses and other infectious diseases. 16, 17 PREDICTION AND EARLY DETECTION OF EMERGING AND REEMERGING ZOONOTIC DISEASES Rapid recognition and response are critical to reducing the mortality, morbidity, and economic and social costs of zoonotic outbreaks. An important factor in early outbreak detection has been the advent of tools for Internet-based infectious disease surveillance. The first of these was ProMED-mail (Programme for Monitoring Emerging Infectious Diseases), created in 1994, which provides continuous, free email updates on new or evolving outbreaks and epidemics 18 Leptospira organisms, named for their morphology (leptos is thin in Greek; spiral is coil in Latin), are spirochetes that persistently infect rodents, concentrating in the kidneys. Infectious organisms are excreted in urine, collect in standing water, and enter humans and other animals either through breaks in the skin or the alimentary canal. Infection is correlated with potential for exposure; hence, leptospirosis is common year-round in the tropics and during warm wet months in temperate climate zones (see Chapter 241). Food markets, particularly those where rodents congregate and where there is opportunity for blood from infected animals to contaminate standing water, are highrisk environments for contraction of disease. The onset of disease is heralded by nonspecific symptoms, such as fever, malaise, and headache. The illness may progress to meningitis, vasculitis, renal and liver failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Antibiotics (penicillin, amoxicillin, and doxycycline) are effective in prophylaxis as well as for therapeutic intervention. There are vaccines for some serotypes.",

Hantaviruses are transmitted by contact with rodent excreta (see Chapter 168); the other clinically significant bunyaviruses are transmitted through blood exchange by arthropod vectors, including mosquitoes, ticks, and flies. Hantaviruses (named for the Hantaan River in South Korea, where the first hantaviruses were identified) may cause hemorrhagic fever with renal failure (hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, HFRS) or an acute respiratory distress syndrome (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS] ). HFRS is more common in Africa, Asia, and Europe. HPS has only been reported in North America. There is no hantavirus-specific drug or vaccine. Recovery from HFRS is not uncommon with supportive care; however, HPS is typically fatal. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, a nairovirus, is distributed throughout Asia and Africa. A wide range of small mammals may serve as reservoirs; domestic sheep, goats, cattle, and horses are typically intermediate hosts. The agent is most commonly transmitted by ticks; however, outbreaks have been linked to preparation or and mortality. However, whereas the primary site of pathology in SARS is the lung, Nipah and Hendra viruses cause encephalitis. Ebola and Marburg viruses cause disseminated intravascular coagulation resulting in hemorrhagic shock and multiorgan failure. Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and the arenaviruses and hantaviruses described in the next section are known collectively as hemorrhagic fever viruses, in accord with the clinical manifestations of disease. A diagnosis can be made based on clinical presentation in cases in which others with similar presentation, including animals, have had a laboratory diagnosis. Although serology can be definitive, a laboratory diagnosis is typically made by an agent-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. There is no established effective therapy for the disease caused by SARS, Nipah, Hendra, Ebola, or Marburg viruses. Vaccines have been effective in preventing disease in animal models of Ebola and Marburg virus infection; monoclonal antibodies may reduce morbidity and mortality in disease caused by Nipah and Hendra viruses. Rabies is typically fatal once the virus enters the central nervous system; however, postexposure prophylaxis is effective, particularly when the exposed individual receives not only vaccine but also rabies immune globulin injected in proximity to the puncture wound.",

They are the largest order of mammals, comprising more than 2200 species, and are implicated in transmission of both viruses and bacteria. The rodentassociated arenaviruses (named for their sandy appearance by electron microscopy; arena means sand in Latin) that cause human disease include Lassa fever virus, endemic in western Africa; lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, found in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres; and several South American viruses, including Guanarito, Junin, Machupo, and Sabia (see Chapter 169). Another African arenavirus, Lujo virus, is presumed, but not proven, to have a rodent reservoir. Lassa fever is clinically similar to the infections caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses; however, whereas Lassa fever virus infection may be asymptomatic in up to 80% of cases, asymptomatic filovirus infection is uncommon. The South American arenaviruses can cause hemorrhagic fever but can also be associated with asymptomatic infection. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus has been implicated in aseptic meningitis and birth defects, particularly in the central nervous system. Although there is no specific drug for arenavirus infection, the commonly linked to contaminated ground beef. Raw poultry is frequently associated with outbreaks of Salmonella and sporadic cases of Campylobacter infections. The use of antibiotics as growth promoters in agriculture also selects for the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that contribute to human morbidity and mortality associated with infectious disease. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is a progressive, fatal brain disorder caused by exposure to misfolded proteins (prions) in cattle, with an analogous disease known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), that catalyze conformational changes in host proteins. BSE was first identified in the United Kingdom in 1986 and peaked in incidence in 1993. The original infection is presumed to have been introduced when cattle were fed with offal from infected sheep or cows. An estimated 400,000 cows with BSE are estimated to have entered the food chain before the outbreak was terminated by culling cattle with behavior indicative of BSE, reducing the age of slaughter (so that titers would be lower in the event an infected animal was inadvertently used for human consumption), and eliminating the practice of feeding animal products to ruminants in 1997. At least 227 people exposed to BSE contracted vCJD. Susceptibility to this disease is determined at least in part by the prion protein (PrP) genotype. The peak incidence of vCJD was observed in 2000 and tapered thereafter. Some investigators predict that a large wave of new cases is unlikely in the absence of recurrence of BSE. However, others note that the incubation of kuru, a prion disorder associated with ritual cannibalism, may be as long as 27 years. The diagnosis of vCJD is made using brain or tonsillar biopsy based on histology and/or the presence of protease-resistant PrP. There is no effective treatment or vaccine for prion diseases.",

            "text": "A detailed discussion of influenza virus is beyond the scope of this chapter (see Chapter 167), yet it is a classic zoonotic disease. Influenza is not typically considered a zoonotic disease because human-tohuman transmission is efficient; however, both birds and pigs play key roles in the maintenance of existing strains and the emergence of new ones. Only influenza A viruses are associated with pandemic disease, presumably because they have a higher propensity to evolve toward antigenic diversity and thus evade host immune surveillance than influenza B and C viruses. Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts of the classic seasonal influenza viruses H1N1 and H3N2. Infection of free-range pigs by migrating aquatic birds or in live-animal markets, where they may be housed near aquatic birds, can lead to genetic reassortment (when more than one type of influenza virus is present) and adaptation to humans. H5N1, popularly known as avian influenza, only rarely results in human disease but is frequently fatal when it does. A wide range of diagnostic assays is available for detection of influenza viruses. Vaccines are designed twice each year to reflect strains predicted to predominate during the influenza season in the Southern and Northern Hemisphere. Their efficacy fluctuates with the accuracy of those predictions but, as a rule, is less effective in inducing a protective immune response in the elderly. Efforts are underway to create universal influenza vaccines based on conserved regions of the virus hemagglutinin, rather than those that evolve to evade the immune system. The drug oseltamivir is effective for many strains.",

Infection is contracted through ingestion of contaminated food or contact with feces of domestic cats, the natural host (see Chapter 280). In most instances, infection is asymptomatic or associated with a transient influenza-like illness; however, with immunosuppression in the context of HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, or pregnancy, the parasite can present as a mass lesion in the brain, causing focal deficits and seizures. Infection of the fetus during pregnancy can result in miscarriage and abnormal brain development. Both house cats and foods of animal origin play roles in the transmission of the agent to humans, where it may remain latent for decades. consumption of infected meat.

In Europe and Asia, the correlate agents include Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii, carried by Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes persulcatus, respectively. Early signs and symptoms of disease may include fever, lassitude, and headache. Some individuals have a classic \"bull's-eye\" skin rash known as erythema chronicum migrans, which is characterized by redness in the center and the periphery with central clearing. Later stages of the disease may include facial weakness (Bell's palsy), peripheral neuropathy, and encephalomyelitis. Rodents are the reservoir for the spirochete; however, deer are also important to its life cycle. Thus, human transmission is most common in suburban and rural areas, particularly where the density of vegetation is sufficiently thick to harbor large concentrations of rodents. Diagnosis is straightforward in the presence of the characteristic rash, when there is history of travel or exposure to an endemic area and a tick bite. However, many patients will not recall a tick bite, and up to 20% may not have the rash. Laboratory tests are frequently inconclusive.",

Thus, hunters, hikers, and farmers are at higher risk. Outbreaks of severe respiratory disease have been described in landscapers. The manifestations of infection vary with the route of exposure. Cutaneous inoculation typically results in a vesicular rash that may ulcerate and regional lymphadenopathy. Ingestion results in oropharyngeal lesions. Inhalation can lead to fatal pneumonia. Ocular inoculation results in conjunctivitis. Without antibiotic treatment, some strains disseminate systemically and are associated with up to 30% mortality. The diagnosis is typically made based on clinical presentation with confirmation by PCR or culture. The agent is sensitive to ciprofloxacin, aminoglycosides, and chloramphenicol.
