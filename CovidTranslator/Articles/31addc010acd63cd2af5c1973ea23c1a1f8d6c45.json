Immunocompromised adults can have more severe disease, including lower respiratory infections (1, 8, 12, 17, 18) and increased mortality (24) . HRV causes symptoms typical of other upper respiratory viruses (20, 25) , and patients can present with an influenza-like illness (ILI) or an afebrile upper respiratory illness. The xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX), the only FDA-cleared molecular assay for the detection of HRV (15) , was used for respiratory virus testing at our institution. This initiation of RVP testing provided a diagnosis for patients with an uncharacterized respiratory virus. We sought to evaluate whether the severity of disease caused by HRV was similar to that of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A (pH1N1).",

The pH1N1 virus in patient specimens was confirmed by the Georgia Public Health Laboratory for inpatients (as per its policy), since no influenza A sample was typed as H1 or H3, which implied that they were all the pH1N1 strain (7) . Patients were considered immunocompromised if they had an actively treated malignancy, HIV infection, or rheumatologic conditions on immunosuppressive therapy or were recipients of solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplants. Patients were considered to have an infection at another site if they had bacteria, viruses, or fungi isolated from any source or a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia or urinary tract infection at the time of testing. A univariate analysis to compare the pH1N1 and HRV groups was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel chisquare test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank sum test, or Fisher's exact test as appropriate, for continuous variables.

Mortality in the HRV group was due to concurrent illness and not directly attributable to HRV infection. Severe HRV infection outbreaks resulting in death in the elderly have been described (14) , and descriptions of morbidity from HRV infection in the elderly are increasing (10, 11, 19, 20) .

Mortality was lower in non-pH1N1-infected patients, but they had fewer immunocompromised patients in these groups (3) .
