Much of our understanding of ssRNA conformational behavior is limited to structures in which ssRNA directly engages in tertiary interactions or is recognized by proteins. Little is known about the structural and dynamic behavior of free ssRNAs at atomic resolution. Here, we report the collaborative application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations to characterize the 12 nt ssRNA tail derived from the prequeuosine riboswitch. NMR carbon spin relaxation data and residual dipolar coupling measurements reveal a flexible yet stacked core adopting an A-form-like conformation, with the level of order decreasing toward the terminal ends. An A-to-C mutation within the polyadenine tract alters the observed dynamics consistent with the introduction of a dynamic kink. Pre-ordering of the tail may increase the efficacy of ligand binding above that achieved by a random-coil ssRNA. The REMD simulations recapitulate important trends in the NMR data, but suggest more internal motions than inferred from the NMR analysis. Our study unmasks a previously unappreciated level of complexity in ssRNA, which we believe will also serve as an excellent model system for testing and developing computational force fields.",

However, the atomic-level structural and dynamic behavior of these elements in the absence of these interactions remains unclear, in large part due to their high degree of flexibility. Several studies suggest that ssRNA polynucleotides adopt stacked and partially helical conformations, particularly adenine-rich sequences; however, the biological relevance of these structures is unclear (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . Atomic-resolution studies of ssRNA are scarce: at present only one isosequential ssRNA and ssDNA sequence has been characterized by homonuclear NMR methods and shown to possess properties reminiscent of A-form and B-form helices, respectively (18) . Few MD studies have been performed on ssRNA, the majority of which use the AMBER force field (19, 20) to explore the impact of chemical modifications such as peptide nucleic acids (PNA) and O2 0 -methylation (21) (22) (23) (24) .",

The aptamer binds preQ 1 , an intermediate in queuosine synthesis, with high affinity to attenuate protein expression at either the transcription or translation level (25) . This class has the smallest minimal aptamer domain (34 nucleotides, nt) discovered to date, consisting of a small hairpin followed by a 12 nt ssRNA tail ( Figure 1A ). Upon ligand recognition, the highly conserved adenine-rich tail condenses into a pseudoknot, forming a host of interactions to both the hairpin and ligand, including A-minor 'kissing' interactions between the ssRNA polyadenine tract and the minor groove (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) . The activity of transcriptionregulating riboswitches, such as the Bacillus subtilis queC riboswitch, has been shown to depend on the kinetics of ligand binding as well as the rate of transcription (8) . Notably, the very small size of the queC riboswitch leaves very little time, in comparison to other switches, for ligand binding to take place prior to formation of the anti-terminator helix which, when formed, prevents terminator helix formation, thereby allowing gene expression to continue. For example, the B. subtilis FMN riboswitch, which is highly dependent upon the rate of polymerase and contains sites that locally pause polymerase to lengthen the ligand-binding window, has $70 nt between the minimal aptamer sequence and complete formation of the anti-terminator helix (8) . In comparison, the ligand-binding window for the queC riboswitch is $20 nt (26, 27) . How efficient ligand binding is achieved is unclear given that the ssRNA tail is thought to be highly disordered, and therefore capable of sampling a wide range of competing conformations.",

To test this hypothesis further, we compared NMR spectra of the isolated 12 nt ssRNA tail with the corresponding spectra of the unbound queC aptamer. Remarkably, NMR spectra of the isolated 12 nt ssRNA tail overlay almost perfectly with the queC aptamer domain and specifically onto the highly intense resonances corresponding to highly disordered residues ( Figure 1B ). The only significant deviations are observed for A25 and U26, which are located at the junction site between the hairpin and the tail ( Figure 1B ). This indicates that in the absence of ligand, the ssRNA tail is not involved in any significant tertiary interactions under the NMR conditions (1 mM RNA, 25 mM sodium chloride, 15 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, 0.1 mM EDTA, 298 K).",

To ensure that the dimer does not obstruct hairpin-tail interactions, we compared a mutant C14U/C17U construct characterized previously by Kang and coworkers to generate a ligandbound solution NMR structure (26) to the WT aptamer. MFold predicts the C14U/C17U mutations will reduce the dimer stability from \u00c06.1 kcal/mol to \u00c00.9 kcal/mol (53). While we observe removal of the kissing dimer, chemical shifts overall overlay extremely well between the WT queC aptamer and the C14U/C17U mutant (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Specifically, tail chemical shifts correspond extremely well to the 12 nt ssRNA, further suggesting that the tail does not participate in tertiary interactions in the absence of ligand under our NMR conditions. Strikingly, the spectra of the 12 nt ssRNA are well resolved, indicating that it does not adopt a completely random conformation ( Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S2 ). This stands in stark contrast to corresponding spectra of a 12 nt polyuridine (polyU) ssRNA, well established to have a random-coil conformation (16) , which exhibits severe spectral overlap indicative of a highly disordered conformation (Supplementary Figure S2) . This structural order is observed in the ssRNA despite the lack of any observable imino protons and therefore any base pairing or secondary structure (Supplementary Figure S3) .",

Highly disordered residues are expected to have chemical shifts similar to nucleotide monophosphates (NMPs). While the chemical shifts of terminal residues are similar to their NMP analogs, increasing differences are observed when approaching the polyadenine core with the greatest differences observed for A30-32 (Supplementary Figure S2 ). The directionality of the chemical shifts is consistent with increased formation of stacking interactions towards the center of the tail (57) . This is further supported by chemical shift perturbations in a trajectory toward the NMPs with increasing temperature (data not shown). Alternatively, addition of magnesium up to 4 mM results in slight chemical shift perturbations farther from NMPs, consistent with previous studies suggesting that increases in ionic strength stabilize ssRNA stacking interactions (59) (data not shown). In contrast polyU has near-identical ( 0.1 ppm) chemical shifts to UMP (Supplementary Figure S2) . Thus, consistent with NOE data, the chemical shift data suggest a comparatively stacked core with a growing level of disorder towards the terminal ends. Normalized resonance intensities (33) further support these observations, which gradually increase towards the terminal ends, consistent with a higher level of pico-to nanosecond motions (Supplementary Figure S2) .",

This makes it difficult if not impossible to assess the absolute level of disorder in the ssRNA; one can only make qualitative assessments about the relative disorder across different residues. However, it is noteworthy that even the comparatively high R 2 /R 1 values measured in the rigid core ($2.9, Figure 2C ) remain significantly lower than values predicted for a perfectly rigid helical ssRNA ($6.4, Supplementary Figure S4 ) as estimated using the program HYDRONMR (41, 42) . If we assume an overall diffusion tensor predicted by HYDRONMR, we find that central polyadenine residues are highly flexible with an estimated average NMR spin relaxation order parameter S 2 of $0.45 ( Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure S4) . Interestingly, similar though slightly smaller absolute S 2 values are calculated from the REMD simulations (on average S 2 $ 0.36 for core residues, Figure 2D ). These data indicate that despite measurable stacking interactions and a helical-like average conformation, the polyadenine core is highly disordered with residues experiencing fluctuations on the order of a \u00b140 cone angle (61) at pico-to nanosecond timescales.",

In the ssRNA, large base C-H RDCs are measured in the polyadenine tract residues that gradually decrease at the termini ( Figure 3A ). Although small RDC values can also arise from static placement of the bond vector near the magic angle relative to the principal direction of order, the overall trends observed are consistent with NMR chemical shift and S 2 rel data suggesting that the RDCs indicate increased dynamic averaging at the termini ( Figure 3A) . Interestingly, the near-zero RDCs measured at terminal residues ( Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S5 ) agree more closely to the REMD simulations compared to the S 2 rel values, indicating that the discrepancy between the measured and computed S 2 rel values may be due to truncation of the S 2 sensitivity to motions faster than nanoseconds. These results add to a growing number of NMR studies on different types of RNA showing that RDC data are capable of probing motions that are incompletely sensed by spin relaxation due to truncation of the time-sensitivity by overall correlation time of the molecule (64, (66) (67) (68) .

Despite the relatively small number of RDCs used in this analysis, we clearly observe a better fit with an A-form geometry (Q-factor 4.77%) as compared to all other conformations (Q-factor ! 16%) ( Figure 3B ). This is consistent with independently observed 3 J H1 0 -H2 0 scalar coupling crosspeaks, which indicate a C3 0 -endo sugar conformation for core residues in the tail, suggesting an A-form (and not B-form) helical geometry. The RDCs are in strong disagreement with preQ 1 -bound X-ray and NMR structures (PDBID: 3FU2 and 2L1V) indicating that the tail must undergo a transition from an A-form helical geometry towards the distinct helical conformation observed in the X-ray and NMR structures in which the A-form geometry is perturbed at the hairpin-tail junction, likely due to torsional strain from the ssRNA folding back upon the hairpin. The REMD-averaged structure has a Q-factor of 30%, indicating a better fit than ligand-bound structures, but is still outside the range considered to represent a good fit. Together, these data suggest that, on average, the ssRNA tail adopts an A-form like conformation. The good RDC fit to the A-form structure also suggests that averaging of the RDCs due to internal motions is largely isotropic in nature, causing a semi-uniform attenuation of the RDCs relative to values expected for an A-form structure. The dynamics could involve exchange between a stacked ordered conformation and unstacked highly disordered conformation, or local isotropic motions about the average A-form conformation.",

Interestingly, PALES predicts a principal direction of order that deviates from the helix axis by 14.4 ; the S zz orientation predicted using PALES is in good agreement from that measured experimentally (deviation $ 5 ).

To determine whether disrupting the polyadenine tract will destabilize the global structure, we substituted A29 within the polyadenine tract with a cytosine residue (referred to as A29C). Other types of mutations involving placements of uridine were not explored as these were expected to yield partially base paired conformations. As with the WT construct, we observed no imino protons, indicating the absence of any detectable base pairing and secondary structure (Supplementary Figure S7) . The 2D C-H spectra for the A29C mutant remain highly disperse, and the chemical shift perturbations relative to WT are clustered around the site of mutation (A28 and A30) ( Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S6) . However, small but significant chemical shift perturbations relative to WT are also observed at more distant residues, including A27, A31, C33 and U34. These perturbations diminish when moving away from the center of the ssRNA and are basically absent in the highly flexible terminal residues ( Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S6 ). Such longer-range perturbations suggest that the mutation may have a long-range effect possibly by influencing the stacking interactions of several nucleobases. A perturbation to stacking interactions is also supported by distinct NOE connectivities in A29C, which show weakened cross peaks to C29, and new crosspeaks between A28 (H2) and A30 (H1 0 ) that indicate C29 partially loops out to allow A28 to stack onto A30 (Supplementary Figure S7) . The melting temperature of the mutant is reduced by $5 C, and the base stacking energies are computed to be $2 kcal/mol lower compared to WT, indicating that the mutation likely destabilizes the stacking interactions (Supplementary Figure S6) .",

Interestingly, the computed absolute S 2 values indicate a global reduction in order for A29C, particularly for residues A27-C33 (Supplementary Figure  S8) , whereas NMR relaxation parameters between WT and A29C are more similar, suggesting comparable global order parameters. The REMD simulations reveal enhanced dynamics at C29 consistent with the NMR chemical exchange data. The REMD simulation also suggests increased dynamics at A32, which is not observed experimentally: although slightly reduced, the S 2 rel is within error of A29-A31 values (S 2 rel of 1) (Supplementary Figure S8) . Computed RDCs agree reasonably with measured RDCs, although the C1 0 H1 0 RDCs are opposite in sign as observed in the comparison between WT NMR and REMD-calculated RDCs. The Q-factor comparing the average REMD structure to measured RDCs is 70%; however, removal of A28 C8H8, A30 C2H2 and A30 C1 0 H1 0 RDCs improves the Q-factor significantly. This improvement is observed only for the REMD structure ( Figure 4D ), indicating that these residues, localized about the mutation site, adopt non-Aform conformations and likely experience perturbations from the increased dynamics at C29. The difference in timescales between the REMD simulations and NMR may be another factor leading to the observed discrepancies. Nevertheless, MD and NMR data both indicate significant dynamics at the mutation site with perturbations extending toward the 3 0 end of the ssRNA. ssRNA tail conformation and dynamics optimized for ligand docking in queC aptamer",

Our study reveals that the ssRNA is not entirely disordered, but rather, has the character of a stacked A-form-like helical conformation which may effectively reduce the conformational search of the ssRNA, promoting efficient docking onto the hairpin to form the pseudoknot. Moreover, our study uncovers a greater degree of flexibility towards the terminal ends, particularly the 5 0 -end which forms the pivot point for docking the ssRNA tail onto the hairpin.",

This together with our findings regarding the conformational behavior of the unbound ssRNA tail suggests the following model for ligand binding ( Figure 5 ). In the absence of ligand, the ssRNA tail is disordered but on average forms an A-form helix-like conformation, which can efficiently explore conformational space about a highly flexible junction. The ligand may transiently form encounter complexes when the tail is close in space to the P1 hairpin, and possibly with the help of divalent ions such as calcium (27, 73) , triggering the necessary conformational changes required to form the pseudoknot and binding pocket. This finding is consistent with computational modeling of the ligand binding mechanism in which A-minor tertiary interactions form first, followed by pseudoknot formation (30) and may explain the fast ligand binding rate observed in the related F. nucleatum queC riboswitch (52). Our results, including the observation of greater dynamics in the mutant, provide a framework for more rigorous testing of this proposed model with future in vitro and in vivo studies.",

Our RDC measurements on the ssRNA, together with scalar coupling constant measurements, strongly suggest that the polyadenine tract forms an A-form-like conformation in the WT ssRNA. Our results also unveil dynamic complexity in ssRNA, including a gradual increase in disorder occurring towards the terminal ends that is reminiscent of unfolded polypeptide chains (74) , and also, slower sequence-specific dynamics occurring at micro-to millisecond timescales that may involve transient stacking/unstacking motions that may result in kinking of the ssRNA.

However, the REMD simulations showed weaker agreement with sugar RDCs or sugar conformation, particularly in the A29C mutant, and had increased dynamics compared to the NMR data. Prior studies on HIV-1 TAR RNA noted higher levels of dynamics in CHARMM simulations compared to NMR measurements (75) . Our studies indicate that suboptimal base stacking energies may be a source of these excess dynamics. However, a quantitative assessment of the simulations requires the application of domain-elongation methods to rigorously decouple internal and overall motions, and make it possible to quantitatively predict NMR measurements (33, (75) (76) (77) . In addition, MD simulations that retain aspects of time are required to compare the rates of dynamics observed by relaxation and exchange broadening type measurements.

            "text": "Finally, our results suggest that the conformational properties of the ssRNA tail are optimized to allow the queC riboswitch to efficiently bind ligands within the short commitment time available to this kinetic switch. In particular, the pre-stacked ssRNA tail can efficiently rotate about a flexible hinge against the hairpin loop, and explore conformational space efficiently for rapid ligand binding. This pre-stacking about dynamic hinges may be a general feature of many ssRNAs that can play different architectural roles in a variety of RNA contexts.",
