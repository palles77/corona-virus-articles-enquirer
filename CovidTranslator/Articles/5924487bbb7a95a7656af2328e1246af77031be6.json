Use of personal respiratory protective equipment was the main method used by HCWs to avoid nosocomial transmission. This paper describes the technology used to evaluate the filtration efficiency of the half-face medical protection mask (N99), manufactured by Firmshield Biotechnology, against viral aerosol. Viral aerosol was generated and then sampled simultaneously with and without the test mask. This enables a percentage efficiency value to be calculated against test phage f2 aerosols (surrogates of viral pathogen aerosols). At the same time the mask filtration efficiency against NaCl particle aerosol was determined by use of TSI8130 equipment and face-fit factor was tested by use of TSI8020 equipment. The half-face medical protection mask (N99) evaluated by use of the viral aerosol had a filtration efficiency [99%. The mask filtration efficiency against NaCl particle aerosol was 99.634 \u00b1 0.024% and it had a good face-fit factor. This half-face medical protection mask (N99) can protect the wearer from viral aerosol disease transmission. The test method can be used to assess filtration efficacy against viral aerosol of masks used for respiratory protection.",

The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, can be explained by aerosol transmission (Tang et al. 2006) . With current concerns about a possible approaching influenza pandemic, the control of disease transmission via infectious air has become more important. Public health services and clinicians and practitioners will be confronted with a new need for infectious disease control. SARS posed a massive challenge because of the effect of nosocomial transmission on healthcare manpower and facilities, and the resources needed for controlling and preventing further spread (Tai 2006) . Nishiyama showed that the risk of developing SARS was 12.6 times higher for individuals not using a mask than for those using a mask (Nishiyama et al. 2008 ).",

Many types of masks were available and the different types offered very different levels of respiratory protection. It was difficult for nonspecialist to assess the filtration efficiency of this equipment. Medical face mask materials tested by the standard method using Staphylococcus aureus aerosol as a bacterial model (ASTM 2007; BS EN 2006; SFDA 2004) were used to protect patients and surgical areas from contamination and not the wearers from the infectious aerosol. Half-face protection masks (N95 and N99) and full-face masks were mostly used in situations of high risk of aerosol transmission of diseases, but no standard testing method was used to evaluate filtration efficiency against viral aerosol. There is a requirement to develop and use standard methods to test such materials, using reliable aerosolgenerating and sampling techniques, to assess their filtration efficacy against viral aerosols. This initial testing can be regarded as a primary ''proof of principle'' before respiratory protection materials are used. Aerosolization of a pathogenic virus requires a very high level of containment to prevent uncontrolled release. Because of aerosol safety issues involved with generation of high viral aerosol concentrations, the method of evaluation used a non-pathogenic virus. In this study, a viral model (bacteriophage f2) was used to test mask filtration efficiency against viral aerosol. A half-face medical protection mask (N99) manufactured by Firmshield Biotechnology was selected to evaluate filtration efficiency against viral aerosols and particle aerosols, and face-fit factor.",

These diseases, which may be caused by a variety of microorganisms, can pose significant risks to life and health. This was tragically highlighted during the international outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 with attack rates of more than 50% in HCW (Wilder-Smith and . Failure to implement appropriate barrier precautions was responsible for most nosocomial transmissions. SARS focused attention on the adequacy of, and compliance with, infection-control practices in preventing airborne and droplet-spread transmission of infectious agents (Gamage et al. 2005) . Even if SARS does not re-emerge, the experience gained from SARS was valuable in preparing for threats of bioterrorism or a global influenza virus pandemic. The right choice of personal protective equipment (PPE) is critical. The selection of respiratory protection levels to be used against a biological agent should be based on infectious risk assessment. Surgical masks protect the patient and surgical area from contamination. They prevent particles (droplets) being expelled. They protect patients in surgery from these particles being transferred to the operative site. They were not suitable when the risk of infection by aerosol transmission of diseases was high. Medical protection masks (N95 and N99) were mostly used when there was high risk of aerosol transmission of diseases.",

But there was no standard method for testing the filtration efficiency against viral aerosol of equipment used for high-risk respiratory protection. Several studies have reviewed the role of respiratory protective devices in the control of TB in health-care settings (Hodous and Coffey 1994; Jarvis et al. 1995 , Schaefer 1997 McCullough and Brosseau 1999) . Studies on respiratory protection against TB were carried out with nonpathogenic bacteria having physical characteristics similar to those of M. tuberculosis (Chen et al. 1994; Qian et al. 1998; Brosseau et al. 1997) . In our study, half-face medical protection masks (N99) were selected to test filtration efficiency against viral aerosol by using a viral model phage f2. Efficiencies of the masks against viral aerosol were determined. Scientifically rigorous testing of the filtration efficiency of respiratory protection intended for use is the first step in investigating the potential benefits of using them to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infection. This study dealt with the primary concern of mask filtration efficiency against viral aerosol and some important characteristics such as face-fit factor and filtration efficiency against particle aerosols, but excluded other physical characteristics such as skin hypersusceptibility, maintenance, and storage. In our study the half-face medical protection mask (N99) had high filtration efficiency-[99% against viral aerosol, [99% against particle aerosol, and a good face-fit factor, which can protect wearers against the aerosol transmission. The results of the viral aerosol test were accordance with results for physical particles. Phage f2 was used as surrogate viral aerosol, similar to other researchers (Chen et al. 2008 ). The surrogate phage f2 was used in place of the pathogenic virus because of aerosol safety issues. Particles in the 1.1-2.1 lm size range lead to the greatest risk of airborne infection (Ko and Burge 2007) . In our study CMD of phage f2 aerosol was 1.20 lm.",

But test methods and procedures are not fully developed and described in the literature. This limits the amount of cross-comparison of results that can be validly performed. Furthermore, the conditions used for the described test methods and procedures are not standardized. For example, a number of flow rates were used in the various studies, and this can substantially affect penetration through the filters (Rengasamy et al. 2004 ). Finally, the paucity of literature on various aspects of respiratory protection against bioaerosols is a limiting factor in drawing conclusions. This test method has been designed to introduce an aerosol challenge to the test specimens at a flow rate of 28.3 L/mm. This flow rate is within the range of normal respiration and within the limitations of the samplers. This test method was used to measure the viral aerosol filtration efficiency of respiratory protection equipment, using the ratio of aerosol concentration before and after the test samples to determine filtration efficiency of respiratory protection materials. It is a quantitative method that enables filtration efficiency for respiratory protection materials to be determined. The flow rate can be adjusted if other flow rate air samplers are used and the aerosol concentration can be adjusted by dilution of the air, so the method can be used to evaluate the filtration efficiency of respiratory protection materials against viral aerosol with larger test flow rates.",
