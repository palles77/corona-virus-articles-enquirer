            "text": "Histiocytic sarcomas represent malignant tumors which require new treatment strategies. Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a promising candidate due to its oncolytic features reported in a canine histiocytic sarcoma cell line (DH82 cells). Interestingly, the underlying mechanism might include a dysregulation of angiogenesis. Based on these findings, the aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of a persistent CDV-infection on oxidative stress mediated changes in the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 and its angiogenic downstream pathway in DH82 cells in vitro. Microarray data analysis, immunofluorescence for 8-hydroxyguanosine, superoxide dismutase 2 and catalase, and flow cytometry for oxidative burst displayed an increased oxidative stress in persistently CDV-infected DH82 cells (DH82Ond pi) compared to controls. The HIF-1\u03b1 expression in DH82Ond pi increased, as demonstrated by Western blot, and showed an unexpected, often sub-membranous distribution, as shown by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Furthermore, microarray data analysis and immunofluorescence confirmed a reduced expression of VEGF-B in DH82Ond pi compared to controls. In summary, these results suggest a reduced activation of the HIF-1\u03b1 angiogenic downstream pathway in DH82Ond pi cells in vitro, most likely due to an excessive, unusually localized, and non-functional expression of HIF-1\u03b1 triggered by a CDV-induced increased oxidative stress.",

Since its establishment in 1988 [19] , a canine histiocytic sarcoma cell line (DH82 cells) has been commercially available. DH82 cells can be infected by CDV-Ond [12] , and have been reported as a promising model for the investigation of viral oncolysis [8, 20, 21] . Specifically, acute infection of DH82 cells with CDV-Ond in vitro resulted in a prominent cell death at 12 days post infection [12] , followed by establishment of persistent infection in tumor cells surviving the acute lytic phase [11] . In this context, subcutaneous xenotransplantion of persistently CDV-Ond infected DH82 cells resulted in a total regression of neoplasms in a mouse model [11] . This promising observation was assumed to be related to a decreased vascularization of the transplants [11] , with the underlying mechanisms not fully understood so far. Therefore, additional investigations using persistently CDV-infected DH82 cells might represent a promising model to study virus-induced alterations of cancer hallmarks [22] and of the tumor microenvironment [23] avoiding the confounding effects correlated with ongoing virus-induced cytopathogenic tumor cell death associated with the acute infection [12] . Indeed, as reviewed by Lapp et al. [8] , viral oncolysis mechanisms can be distinguished between primary (i.e., direct virus-induced cytolysis and/or apoptosis) and secondary ones. The latter include a wide range of events leading to tumor cell death, such as modulation of the antiviral and antitumoral immune response, changes in the organization of the tumor-associated extracellular matrix, and alterations of the tumor-associated vasculature and angiogenesis [3, 4, 7, 8, 11, [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

ROS are highly chemically reactive molecules that can induce damage to cellular macromolecules such as nucleic acid and lipids, when they outnumber scavenging systems [28] [29] [30] . CDV infection can increase ROS production and ROS-induced damage in vitro and in vivo as shown for spontaneous CDV infection in dogs [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Furthermore, CDV can induce an accumulation of viral glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of Vero cells and primary rat neurons, resulting in increased endoplasmic reticulum stress [36] , which has been reported as associated with an increased ROS production [37] . Nevertheless, ROS are physiologically involved in a plethora of different intracellular signaling pathways [29, 30] , and play a key role in multiple hallmarks of cancer [38] .",

This event induces the expression of numerous genes involved in different cellular responses such as angiogenesis [40, 41] , which is driven by several growth factors, including members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family. Hypoxia, and to a lesser extent ROS, represent the most important stimuli for HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization and nuclear translocation [39, 42] . During normoxia and redox homeostatic state [28] , HIF-1\u03b1 is localized within the cytoplasm and is rapidly degraded by the proteasome after hydroxylation by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and subsequent ubiquitination by the von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL) [39, 40, 42] . In this context, hypoxia and ROS directly down-regulate the activity of PHDs and VHL [42] , playing therefore a key role in the inhibition of the overall HIF-1\u03b1 degradation.",

This choice was justified by the results of the functional profiling of the same dataset obtained in a previous study, highlighting a down-regulation of the expression of some of the genes correlated with angiogenesis [11] . Therefore, in the current work, a list of human and murine genes and proteins was manually generated according to the literature [29, 31, 36, 37, [39] [40] [41] [42] 45, 46] and translated into canine orthologous gene symbols using the web-based HGNC database (HGNC Database, HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SD, United Kingdom, www.genenames.org [47] ). After filtration, the raw expression data of the selected genes were compared between non-infected DH82 and DH82Ond pi cells, employing multiple pairwise nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-tests. Statistical analysis was performed with SAS Enterprise Guide (SAS version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). Differential expression was defined as the combination of a fold change (FC) filter (FC \u2265 1.5 or \u2264 \u22121.5) and of a statistical significance filter (Mann-Whitney U-test; p \u2264 0.05) [48] . To facilitate the interpretation of results, each gene symbol was assigned to at least one of the following functional groups on the basis of the function(s) carried out by its corresponding protein(s): ROS production; ROS scavenging; ER stress; HIF-1\u03b1 activation, transcriptional activity and regulation; HIF-1\u03b1 angiogenic downstream pathway.",

Specifically, neutrophil cytosolic factor 4 (NCF4) and thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), belonging to ROS production and ROS scavenging functional groups, respectively, were the two most markedly up-regulated genes among the entire set examined.

Among the group of genes related to ER-stress (partially overlapping with both ROS production and ROS scavenging functional groups), 12 genes were up-regulated while 14 were down-regulated. Specifically, among the genes included in the ER stress functional group, the xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) was up-regulated, while among down-regulated genes were included 3 (PDIA3, PDIA4 and PDIA6) out of 4 genes related to protein disulphide isomerases, one (ERO1L) out of two genes related to endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductines, and two (CANX and DDIT3) out of three genes previously related to ER-stress induced by acute infection with CDV [36] .

Similarly, the present study revealed increased ROS levels in DH82Ond pi cells, as demonstrated by an increased oxidative burst, as well as suggested by increased gene transcription of TXNIP and NCF4. Specifically, the upregulation of both genes might correlate with an increased intracellular oxidative stress. Indeed, NCF4 encodes for p40 phox , a protein that is involved in NADPH oxidase 2 activation [29, 41, 52] . Additionally, thioredoxin-binding protein 2, encoded by the TXNIP gene, is an important inhibitor of the thioredoxin ROS scavenging system [29, 53] . On the other hand, ROS-induced nucleic acid damage did not differ in DH82Ond pi cells compared to non-infected controls. This observation might be interpreted as indicative of an increased oxidative stress associated with the neoplastic nature of DH82 cells rather than an effect of the viral infection. Similarly, increased intracellular ROS levels are described in the literature as a common feature of cancer cells [38, 45, 61] . In addition, DH82Ond pi cells displayed an increased expression of SOD2 and CAT compared to non-infected controls. The overexpression of these scavenging enzymes involved in ROS detoxification have been correlated with an increased oxidative stress in neoplastic [38, 45, 61] as well as in inflammatory conditions [62] .",

The data in the present study might be interpreted as suggestive of an acquired ability of DH82 cells to adapt to the persistent infection with CDV-Ond. However, a marked protein overexpression of ER-stress markers such as calnexin, calreticulin and CHOP/GADD 153 have been observed in Vero cell and primary rat neurons 36 h post-infection with recombinant A75/17-V CDV [31] . On the other hand, the aforementioned lack of differences in growth and apoptotic rate between non infected and DH82Ond pi cells [20, 21] is in line with the hypothesis that a persistent infection with CDV-Ond might be associated with the activation of adaptive and pro-survival pathways to contrast prolonged oxidative stress, as reported in recombinant HeLa cells expressing silkworm storage protein 1 [54] . The hypothesis of the present study is further supported by the finding of an increased expression of ROS-scavenging enzymes in DH82Ond pi cells at both a molecular and protein level, highlighting the plasticity of cancer cells in actively contrasting excessively severe alterations in their redox potential [45, 61] .",

Hypoxia has been widely reported as the most powerful inductor of HIF-1\u03b1 transcriptional activity [39, 40, 42] ; however, in the present study, cells were cultivated under normoxic conditions. Therefore, hypoxia could be excluded as the cause of the increased HIF-1\u03b1 protein expression observed in our in vitro model. Consequently, it seems more plausible that the increased expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in DH82Ond pi cells was induced by the increased oxidative stress level compared to non-infected controls. The down-regulation of 2 PHDs as well as of VHL on a molecular level, in association with a lacking regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 opposed to an increased expression of the corresponding protein, could imply that the increased protein expression of HIF-1 \u03b1 in DH82Ond pi cells does not refer to an increased synthesis, but rather to an inhibition of the degradation pathway.",

Further investigations aiming to better characterize the aforementioned vesicles, revealed a co-localization of HIF-1\u03b1 expression with CD63, a marker for the tetraspanin-30 expressed by exosomal membranes [63] . Interestingly, the presence of HIF-1\u03b1 within CD63 + exosomes has previously been reported in Epstein-Barr virus-infected NP69 cells [58] . On the other hand, HIF-1\u03b1 only occasionally co-localized with CD63 + exosomes, while it frequently overlapped with the localization of CDV-NP. The measles virus N-protein, which is closely related to CDV-NP [64] , is transported within the cell through the endolysosomal system [59] , also rendering this a possible mechanism for the canine counterpart. Furthermore, this observation displays an interesting basis for future investigations on the exact sub-cellular localization of HIF-1\u03b1 within DH82Ond pi cells.",

Though VEGF-B is nowadays recognized as not being directly involved in angiogenesis, this growth factor has been reported as an indirect enhancer of VEGF-A (a well-known inducer of angiogenesis), as well as a key promoter of survival of different cell types (including endothelial cells, pericytes and smooth muscle cells) in several pathological conditions [65] [66] [67] . As already reported in the literature [20] , the markedly reduced expression of VEGF-B in DH82Ond pi cells did not affect cellular growth nor the apoptotic rate [21] . Interestingly, DH82Ond pi cell xenotransplants displayed a significantly reduced microvessel density compared to non-infected controls [11] . According to the results of the present study, it can be assumed that HIF-1\u03b1 might represent an important mediator of the oncolytic effects described for the in vivo model of DH82Ond pi xenotransplants as reported previously in another viral oncolysis model [68] .",

This is most likely due to an excessive, unusually localized, and non-functional expression of HIF-1\u03b1, which might be the consequence of a decreased cytosolic degradation of this transcriptional factor following a virus-induced increased oxidative stress. Future studies are warranted to better characterize the localization of HIF-1\u03b1 and the exosomes in which it is contained, as well as to verify the presence of an increased oxidative stress and an aberrant HIF-1\u03b1 localization in DH82Ond pi also in vivo. The latter approach might further substantiate the assumed correlation between reduced angiogenesis, hypoxia and tumor regression in DH82Ond pi xenotransplants. ",
