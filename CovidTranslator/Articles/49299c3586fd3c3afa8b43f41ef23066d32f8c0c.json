The spectroscopic properties of 12a were identical to that previously reported for 4 (same as 12a). 7 To address any possible structural ambiguity in this study, confirmation of 6 was achieved by an X-ray structural analysis. 10 In an antiviral analysis, 11 both 6 and 7 showed moderate activity towards hepatitis B (EC 50 7.1 lM and 7.4 lM, respectively; CC 50 >100 lM)) while only 7 was potent against human cytomegalovirus (EC 50 0.72 lM; CC 50 >300 lM). Compound 6 was found to lack the significant yellow fever properties reported for 4 indicating addition of a hydroxyl to the methyl carbon of 4 (12a), resulted in an undesirable outcome for future development of 4 as a yellow fever antiviral candidate.
