This article reviews pertinent outbreaks, identifies principal viral agents involved, and delineates systems which may be at greatest risk. The results of two recent laboratory studies which sought to define environmental factors that contribute to virus accumulation by shellfish are also discussed. First, the accumulation of environmentally significant levels of feces-associated and monodispersed poliovirus by oysters (Crassostrea virgbica) and clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) was investigated. The results of this study suggested that virus accumulation by mollusks may not be significant when water column concentrations are below ~0.01 plaque-forming units (PFU) per milliliter. The second study focused on the relative contributions of undisturbed sediments versus those in the water column in the accumulation of viruses by epifaunal and infaunal shellfish (C. virgikca and M. mercenarid. Viruses were found to be most efficiently accumulated when suspended in the water column.",

Table I presents the major groups involved, along with some of the diseases with which they are associated. Although there is insufficient epidemiological evidence to support a shellfish-mediated disease potential for all the viral agents listed, two (hepatitis and Norwalk) have been unquestionably linked to disease outbreaks associated with the environmentally contaminated shellfish. The first reported shellfish-related outbreak of hepatitis occurred in Sweden in 1955, resulting in 629 cases (Roes, 1956) . Since then, significant outbreaks have occurred in New Jersey, Mississippi, and Alabama in 1961; in Philadelphia and Connecticut in 1963; in North Carolina in 1964; New Jersey in 1966; and in Rhode Island and Massachusetts in 1971 (Portnoy et al., 1975) . An outbreak occurred during October and November 1973 affecting 263 individuals from Houston and 15 from Calhoun, Georgia following the consumption of raw oysters from certified waters of Louisiana Bay (Portnoy et al., 1975) . Mahoney et al. (1976) detected the presence of Australia antigen (Au), indicative of the presence of type B hepatitis virus, in Maine clams. The clams were taken from waters known to be contaminated with untreated sewage from a local hospital. The antigen could be transmitted to previously uninfected clams, indicating that shellfish could act as both vector and reservoir for Au antigen. Recent studies have identified shellfish carriage of Norwalk or related parvo-like viruses in a series of outbreaks of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis occurring in Australia (Murphy et al., 1979; Grohmann et al., 1981; Linco and Grohmann, 19801, Great Britain (Appleton et al., 1981) and the United States (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 1982) .",

However, efforts to document the impact of such reservoirs on resident moiluscs have not been pursued. The object of one of the studies described herein was to address the relative importance of sediments in the accumulation of viruses by shellfish using a sediment-associated poliovirus model. As previously noted, viruses have been detected in shellfish residing in grossly polluted waters, as well as in those areas certified for the harvesting of shellfish. Vaughn et al. (1979) have reported the sporadic isolation of polio and echoviruses from clams and oysters residing in two approved shellfish harvesting areas located on Long Island. Viral concentrations in these waters averaged 0.001 (kO.0007) plaque-forming units (PFU) per milliliter. In a later report, the authors noted the occasional occurrence of unidentified enteroviruses in clams residing in Raritan Bay, New Jersey . Here, virus levels in the water colunn were substantially lower than the above concentrations (mean = 8.34 x 10e5 PFU/ml). In neither case was there evidence to support any correlation between viral occurrence in shellfish and their presence in overlying waters. Similar findings were also reported by Goyal et al.

A survey of previous studies revealed that few have focused on the mode and mechanism of shellfish accumulation at virus concentrations normally found in light to moderately polluted marine systems. Almost invariably, laboratory bioaccumulation studies have employed high virus exposure concentrations (e.g., 103-lo6 PFUlml) in an effort to elucidate the mechanisms of viral uptake. A recent study, which employed more environmentally appropriate virus levels, was conducted by Metcalf et al. (1974) . In this study, shellfish were exposed to both free and solid-associated viruses at concentrations ranging from 0.09 to 14.0 PFUfml. After a brief exposure, viruses were recovered from nearly all shellfish. Bioaccumulation was most evident at the higher viral concentrations, particularly when solidassociated, rather than free viruses were employed. Although these exposure levels represented the lowest reported in laboratory studies, they still exceeded the concentrations of viruses normally encountered in lightly polluted waters. The objective of the second study described here was to analyze the accumulation capabilities of shellfish exposed to \"environmentally significant\" levels of virus, and determine whether an apparent level existed, below which viral accumulation and carriage was absent, transient, or undetectable. The virus concentrations chosen for these studies ranged from 0.002 to 0.180 PFU/ml, and included both monodispersed and feces-associated types.",

Cores were then placed in the 190-liter tank which contained sufficient seawater to saturate each core. Virus-inoculated sediments (100-g aliquots) were then added to the surface of the partially immersed cores. A spatula was used to smooth the surface of the cores, ensuring that the sediments remained even with the top edge of the plastic piping. In experiments using undisturbed sediments, inoculated cores were gently covered with a wetted piece of filter paper (Whatman No. 1) to prevent sediment resuspension during filling of the tank. The water level was gradually raised to a height sufficient to cover both cores and shellfish. During the filling process, the filter paper eventually lifted off the core surface and was carefully removed with forceps. This procedure was effective in controlling the resuspension of small air-trapped sediment aggregates. Several uninoculated cores were included in the experimental tank.
