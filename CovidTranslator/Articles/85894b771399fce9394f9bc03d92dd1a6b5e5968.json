Financial realities must be considered. It is important to address the cost of care and give clients a schedule and treatment plan (including a cost estimate) for upcoming visits so that they can plan for these expenses. The AAHA strongly suggests that all pet-owning families consider their ability to meet unexpected expenses that may be incurred for veterinary care (Box 8-1). The expenses may be met through existing savings, credit card reserves, Care Credit or other medical payment cards, monthly budgeting for pet care expenses, or pet health insurance policies. Pet health insurance has become a good method of mitigating health care expenses. The proportion of cats insured varies greatly among different countries, but it is almost invariably lower than the proportion of dogs insured. Pet insurance can provide excellent value for the cost and allow patients to receive highly expensive urgent care and crisis management that may not be feasible otherwise. Many policies now offer preventive health care coverage. Each insurance company works differently, and clients are encouraged to review policies carefully. Few clients are aware of pet insurance without a specific veterinary recommendation; the veterinary team should explain benefits and possible limitations of pet insurance. The National Commission on Veterinary Economic Issues (NCVEI) position paper, \"A veterinarian's guide to pet health insurance,\" contains excellent information to help veterinarians and veterinary teams learn more about pet insurance. 100 In the United States there is also a website that helps consumers compare various pet health insurance companies (Pet Insurance Review, see Box 8-1).",

According to the American Humane Association, only about 2% of lost cats ever find their way back from shelters, a major reason being the lack of tag or microchip identification (see .

If owners are properly informed, cats can retain their normal behaviors in ways that are also acceptable to cat owners. Client education should begin at the first appointment and reviewed during each life stage. It has been shown that dog obedience training and the receipt of advice regarding companion animal behavior reduce the risk of relinquishment to an animal shelter and increase human-companion animal interactions. 87 If cat owners receive the same education, by participating in training or \"Kitten Kindy\" classes (see Chapter 11) that deal with normal feline behavior and prevention of behavioral problems, they are less likely to relinquish their cats and more likely to have a satisfying human-cat relationship. Veterinarians must also remind clients to call the veterinary hospital with any behavioral questions and concerns, which will, with any luck, keep them from acting on misinformation from other sources. If the veterinarian is unable to help, referring the client to an appropriate specialist is an important way to maintain the human-animal bond as well as the veterinarianclient relationship.

Cats need resources in the home to allow them to perform their normal behavior: scratching posts in desirable locations and cat trees, perches, or shelves to allow for climbing and resting and to increase overall space in the home (Figure 8-6 ). Normal feeding behavior and multiple toileting (litter box) areas are also necessary. Many cats also like hiding spots, especially in multicat households, households with children, and when company visits. Queens teach kittens to play so that they learn to hunt for food and catch their prey; play is an important component of the cat's day. Cats are social animals and enjoy both interactive toys and hunting games. They also enjoy playing on areas. Most cats prefer unscented clumping litter, 65, 70 and some cats may find scented litters aversive. Kittens may be offered a variety of litter box options from which to choose, with one choice being unscented clumping litter. 66 Litter boxes should be scooped at least once daily and changed completely once weekly for clay litter and once every 2 weeks for clumping litter. Cats also prefer litter boxes 66 large enough for them to turn around in; the ideal size is approximately 1.5 times the size of the cat, from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail. 70 Most commercial cat litter boxes are too small; plastic clothes storage boxes and dog litter boxes for dogs up to 35 pounds are excellent choices (Figure 8-7) . Cats with arthritis and other health problems that make it difficult to jump over the edge of the box should be provided with a box that has a smaller lip or edge at the front of the box; dog litter boxes already have these.

Multimodal environmental modification (MEMO) has also been shown to decrease clinical signs of interstitial cystitis and respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. 12, 14 The more cats in the household, the more resources are needed to increase feline welfare and help prevent behavioral problems. Litter boxes are an excellent example showing why cats need multiple resources. The recommendation for the number of litter boxes is traditionally one litter box per cat plus one extra, so that a household with three cats should contain four litter boxes, placed in different locations. In a multiplefloor dwelling, a minimum of one box should be placed on each floor to which the cats have access. This allows cats to have easy access to a litter box regardless of where the cat is in the house and reduces the risk of another cat blocking access to the cat or bothering it while it is eliminating. Boxes should be located in easily accessible areas but not high-traffic may develop. Stress associated with the change in intercat relationships can lead to inappropriate urination or spraying. It is critical to provide needed resources in multiple areas. Synthetic feline pheromone (Feliway diffusers and spray) therapy is purported to assist in spatial organization, enhance intercat relations, and provide emotional stabilization. 66",

Intercat social play peaks at about 12 weeks of age, 16 after which object play becomes more prevalent. Toys offer an outlet for normal predatory sequences as part of play and help prevent play biting. The primary socialization period of cats to people is from 3 to 9 weeks of age. If kittens associate positive experiences with exposure to humans during this time, they will be more willing to approach people and be held by them later in life. Kittens should be handled gently and positively and exposed as early as possible to any stimuli or handling techniques the cat may encounter during their lifetime (e.g., children, dogs, nail trims, tooth brushing, car rides) (Figures 8-8 and 8-9). Positive carrier, car, and veterinary experiences that occur early in life can improve future veterinary visits (Figure 8-10 ). Positive behaviors should always be reinforced by using food or other appropriate rewards; kittens should never be punished because this may elicit defensive aggression.",

Intercat relations may change when a cat reaches 1 to 2 years of age (the age at which free-living offspring leave the family unit), and intercat aggression reinforced for desirable behavior and never punished verbally or physically. Feline onychectomy, or declawing, is illegal in Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and many European countries. Although declawing was once considered a routine procedure in the United States, it is now ethically controversial. The current position statements (see Box 8-1) of the AVMA, the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association, the AAFP, and the AAHA state that declawing should be considered only after efforts are made to prevent the cat from using the claws destructively (e.g., scratching posts, nail trimming) or for cats that live with immunocompromised people for whom clawing may present a zoonotic disease or injury risk. Zoonotic disease potential should be discussed and documented in the medical record. If declawing is performed, four-paw declawing is not recommended; keeping the hind claws allows the cat some means of protection, and property destruction and human injury occur less commonly with the rear claws. There are good alternatives to onychectomy, including training cats to use scratching posts and trimming their nails regularly. In most cases clients can be taught to trim nails, especially with kittens. Nails should be trimmed in a calm environment, and the cat should be positively reinforced. In addition to nail-trimming demonstrations, at-home education can be reinforced with client educational handouts or a video on nail trimming (see Box 8-1). The client educational handout \"How To Prevent Cats from Scratching in Undesirable Areas\" is provided at the end of the AAFP Feline Behavior Guidelines. 70 Another alternative is temporary synthetic nail caps that are usually applied every 4 to 6 weeks.",

It is important to explain to clients that prophylaxis involves removing plaque and calculus both supragingivally (above the gum line) and subgingivally (below the gum line). Cleaning only above the gum line has no therapeutic effect; it is the plaque and calculus below the gum line that cause periodontal disease, the most common dental disease in cats.

            "text": "Dental disease is extremely common in cats and can affect feline health and welfare. 53 Client education about preventive dental care is crucial because the majority of cat owners do not understand the seriousness of this silent disease. As previously noted, cats rarely show signs of pain, and their difficulty chewing and other problems related to their dental disease may not be obvious. Left untreated, dental disease is often painful, can lead to inappetence, and can contribute to other local and systemic diseases. Fortunately, dental care allows for optimal health and quality of life. 41 The compliance rate for preventive dental care in the United States is only 9% for cats, 56 which is less than that for any other needed preventive care. 1 As mentioned previously, cat owners generally have a higher level of education than dog owners and may become more compliant if they receive adequate information. 56 Incidence studies and other statistical information may help clients recognize that feline preventive dental care is necessary. In one study of 109 apparently healthy cats, 98.2% had periodontal disease. 34 The prevalence of tooth resorption lesions in cats in the same clinical environment showed lesions to be present in 70% of purebred cats and 38% of mixed-breed cats. These cats were fed only dry food and had annual dental scalings. 33 Cats of all life stages need both home and veterinary dental care to allow for complete oral health-kittens for retained deciduous teeth and dentition problems and cats 2 years of age and older for periodontal disease and other problems. 41 The wellness examination is the ideal time to discuss dental health. An oral examination is included with each exam, and at least an annual examination is recommended for cats with healthy dentition. Semiannual examinations can help ensure optimal home care. 41 In addition, cats with gingivitis should be evaluated every 6 months, and more frequently if periodontitis is found. 41 Evaluation of the oral cavity in the conscious feline patient allows the veterinarian to design a preliminary treatment plan 41 ; anesthesia is required to perform a complete and thorough oral examination and formulate a precise treatment plan. Dental cleaning, periodontal and the polyunsaturated fatty acids arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) are obligatory in their diets, although these may not be absolutely essential during all life stages. 6, 64 The precise energy and nutrient requirements of cats vary depending on various factors such as age (e.g., increased nutrient demand during growth and reduced digestibility in older cats), activity levels, neutering status, and pregnancy and lactation. Although homeprepared diets may be used to support all feline life stages, ensuring that all macronutritional and micronutritional needs are adequately provided in such foods can be problematic, and there may be risks associated with the use or feeding of raw foods (e.g., transmission of infectious diseases). Commercially available dry or wet foods that meet the specific nutritional requirements of cats at the appropriate life stage and have been tested in feeding trials are the best way to ensure that a diet is satisfactory. 99 Development of food preferences in cats is complex and incompletely understood. Studies of feeding behavior in cats have demonstrated a so-called monotony effect in which cats may develop an aversion to foods that have formed a large part of their diet. This may be a protective mechanism; eating a variety of foods may reduce the likelihood of an unbalanced or deficient diet. However, although the monotony effect has been demonstrated in both kittens and adults, it appears to be much stronger in free-ranging cats and can be abrogated, at least in part, in cats raised on nutritionally complete diets. 10 Kittens are also strongly influenced in their food preferences by their mothers, 10,101 and a primacy effect may be seen whereby adult cats develop a strong preference for their weaning or normal diet. 10, 90 Feeding Regimens Many feeding regimens may be successful in maintaining feline nutritional health, including both free access to daily food rations and provision of food in meals. It is impossible to replicate the natural diet or feeding conditions of wild cats, but partially mimicking this by placing dry food in foraging devices (e.g., food balls or puzzles) or dispensing the food in multiple small meals in several widely dispersed places (which may include hiding the food) may help in slowing food intake and providing mental and physical stimulation. 99 Cats should be fed away from toileting areas (e.g., litter boxes), and quiet areas should be chosen, especially for nervous cats. For healthy cats there is no evidence to suggest that feeding a single diet or feeding a variety of diets (or flavors) is beneficial or detrimental, and the preferences of an individual cat may be determined in part by food exposure at the time of weaning.",

However, even older cats can be trained to accept tooth brushing, and this should be recommended for them routinely. Client compliance for adult cats may increase if education follows dental prophylaxis or treatment because these clients are more aware of dental health problems. Tooth brushing should never be done in a forceful manner or when the client is at risk of being injured. It is best to train the cat with positive reinforcement, starting first by lifting the lips and immediately giving the cat a treat.

Regular monitoring of body weight and body condition score along with appropriate adjustments of caloric intake are vital. Neutered cats are likely to need approximately 30% fewer calories than typically indicated in feeding guidelines printed on cat food packaging. 103 Using food balls, hiding food, and encouraging foraging through other means can be valuable ways both to increase exercise and to prevent overeating at meal times (Figure 8-12 ). 99",

Among the zoonotic parasites, Toxocara cati has recently been increasingly recognized as a potential cause of visceral and ocular larval migrans in humans. 28 studies are shown in Table 8 -3. The data from different countries and studies are clearly not comparable insofar as the prevalence of infection largely depends on the age, background, and lifestyle of the cats examined and is also affected by the detection technique used. In general, nematode (with the exception of hookworms) and protozoal infections are more common in young cats, whereas cestode and hookworm infections tend to be more common in adults. Infections are generally also more common in stray or feral cats and in cats from multicat environments. Also, there are geographic variations in the prevalence of parasites, with some having a restricted distribution. Although a variety of diagnostic tests are valuable in assessing the presence of endoparasites, fecal flotation techniques are commonly employed in veterinary clinical practice to diagnose and demonstrate infection with common endoparasites such as helminths, nematodes, and coccidia. Commonly used solutions for fecal flotation techniques include zinc sulfate (331 g ZnSO 4 in 1 L water, for a specific gravity [SG] of 1.18 to 1.20), magnesium sulfate (450 g MgSO 4 in 1 L water, for a SG of 1.20), and saturated salt (350 g NaCL in 1 L water, for a SG of 1.18 to 1.20). However, studies in dogs (which can be assumed to be applicable to cats) indicate that using a modified Sheather's sugar solution that produces a higher SG of 1.27 (454 g granulated sugar dissolved in 355 mL hot water with 6 mL formaldehyde to prevent microbial growth) is considerably more efficient in diagnosing common infections. This method yields fewer false-negative results (studies used 2 g feces mixed with 10 mL flotation solution), especially when dealing with heavier worm eggs such as Taenia spp. Furthermore, the use of a centrifugation-flotation technique (280 g for 5 minutes) followed by a standing time of 10 minutes was also much more sensitive than using routine fecal examination may not always detect the presence of an infection, and because these ascarids are prevalent and T. cati should be considered a zoonosis, routine prophylaxis (discussed later) is always recommended.",

Generally T. cati is more commonly encountered than T. leonina, and both are more common in kittens and young cats than adults. Adult worms measuring 8 to 15 cm in length are found in the small intestine, with ova being shed in the feces after a prepatent period of approximately 5 to 7 weeks for T. cati and around 9 to 12 weeks for T. leonina. The life cycle can be either direct (through ingestion of infective ova) or indirect (through ingestion of infected paratenic hosts such as rodents, birds, worms, or mollusks). In contrast to dogs, there is no transplacental migration with Toxocara spp. in cats, although infection with T. cati leads to liver-lung migration of larvae, and because larvae may also be present in the milk of queens, they can be transmitted to neonatal kittens. Diagnosis of infection is through fecal flotation techniques to demonstrate the presence of ova. However, with, and access to, intermediate hosts.

However, when such risks cannot be completely controlled, routine prophylaxis is indicated and a broadspectrum anthelmintic (rather than a narrow-spectrum type that controls only ascarids and hookworms) should be selected. Both indoor and outdoor cats are at risk of infection with heartworm, and routine prophylaxis is important in areas where the parasite is endemic or when cats may move to such areas (e.g., cats that vacation with owners in such areas). In these cases monthly prophylaxis is recommended. Testing (serum antigen and antibody tests) of cats before commencement of therapy is recommended by both the CAPC and the ESCCAP to detect any cats already infected; using products that are adulticide in an infected cat may create a life-threatening reaction, and adulticide treatment is therefore not generally recommended for cats at this time. There is no evidence that it improves survival in infected cats, and the death of adult worms can be life threatening. However, the American Heartworm Society (see Box 8-1) recommends monthly doses of oral ivermectin or milbemycin oxime or topical moxidectin or selamectin as chemoprophylaxis against heartworm infection from 8 weeks of age in cats in endemic areas, and administration of these drugs is not precluded by a positive serum antigen or antibody test. Many heartworm preventives also provide control of other parasites, and the spectrum of activity of some anthelmintics used in cats is shown in Table 8-4. the right ventricle and pulmonary artery). Infections in cats are usually more severe than in dogs, and Dirofilaria immitis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in cats. There is a wide geographic distribution for D. immitis, with infection being more prevalent in tropical and subtropical climates where the mosquito intermediate hosts exist. Diagnosis of D. immitis infection in cats relies on a combination of antigen and antibody tests and also echocardiography, which may demonstrate adult worms in the right side of the heart, the caudal vena cava, or the pulmonary arteries. 51 Radiographs of the chest may show enlargement of the caudal lobar arteries and a bronchointerstitial lung pattern (heartworm-associated respiratory disease) that may mimic feline asthma. Treatment of cats infected with adult D. immitis is not recommended because this can induce fatal reactions, which underscores the importance of prophylaxis to prevent infection with this parasite in cats.",

Unfortunately, local immune responses, particularly important for certain respiratory and gastrointestinal tract pathogens, are not easily measured. Information about vaccine-induced serum antibody responses and resistance to infection has been collected primarily for feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline herpesvirus (FHV-1), and feline calicivirus (FCV). For FPV cats with serum antibodies from vaccination within the previous 7 years are protected against challenge. 80 However, the situation is not as clear for FHV-1 and FCV because vaccination against these pathogens does not reliably induce sterilizing immunity. The predictive value of serum antibody titers to determine the need for revaccination is unclear. 80 It is important to note that antibody tests offered by laboratories should not be assumed to be equivalent and virus neutralization assays are probably the best predictor of resistance to infection. Finally, failure to demonstrate serum antibodies against FPV, FCV, or FHV-1 does not necessarily indicate susceptibility to infection but should be taken as an indicator that revaccination is likely beneficial.",

Cats and kittens should always receive a complete physical examination before Vaccination Prevention of disease is the ultimate goal of veterinarians, and the widespread use of vaccines undoubtedly has contributed greatly to achievement of that goal. However, the current prevalence of vaccination in cat populations is not sufficiently high to achieve a good level of herd immunity, and elimination of infectious agents, 42 with only an estimated 25% of cats in North America ever being vaccinated. 84 The practical implication of this statistic is that a more realistic goal is containment and control of infection in defined populations of cats (e.g., multicat environments), along with protection of the individual animal against disease and infection. However, the value of reaching a much wider population of cats with vaccination should not be underestimated, and the WSAVA Vaccine Guidelines Group (VGG) has stated that the aim should be to vaccinate every animal but each individual animal less frequently. 21 Vaccination is not an entirely innocuous procedure, and side effects sometimes occur. The prevalence of adverse events associated with vaccination has recently been reported to be less than 1%, depending on the vaccine and method of data collection. 31, 35, 63 It is important to note that most of these reactions are mild and transient. In one study risk of an adverse reaction after vaccination was greatest for cats of approximately 1 year of age, and lethargy with or without fever was the most commonly reported reaction. 63 Female cats were at greater risk than male cats of the same neuter status. Although breed was not associated with increased risk in this study, in another report based on a passive surveillance system in the United Kingdom, some breeds were overrepresented. 31 Occasionally, though, severe and life-threatening events can occur, such as hypersensitivity reactions or injection-site sarcomas. 20, 42 Such devastating effects, although rare, challenge the assumption that vaccine choice and vaccination intervals are not important considerations. Adverse events should be reported to both the product manufacturer and the appropriate regulatory authority. In the United States this is the Department of Agriculture, Center for Veterinary Biologics (http:// www.aphis.usda.gov), in Canada this is the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (http://www.inspection.gc.ca), and in the United Kingdom this is the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (http://www.vmd.gov.uk).",

The minimum interval between vaccinations is 2 weeks, and the maximum recommended interval is 4 weeks. 80 If a kitten is presented for a booster vaccination 6 weeks or longer after the previous dose, at least two doses of vaccine should be administered, 3 to 4 weeks apart. 80 Adult cats of unknown vaccination status may receive a single modified live virus core vaccination, with a booster 1 year later. If a killed virus core vaccine product is used, adult cats should receive two injections, 3 to 4 weeks apart, with a booster vaccination 1 year later. The exception is rabies vaccine, wherein one injection is given with a booster 1 year later. Any brand of vaccine is suitable as a booster; it is not vaccination to determine age, existence of illness, and factors that may affect the immune response. Maternally derived antibodies (MDAs) may affect the ability of kittens to respond to vaccination. In most kittens MDA is lost by 9 to 12 weeks of age, but this may occur either earlier (6 weeks of age or earlier) or later (as late as 16 weeks of age) depending on the individual and the pathogen. Little data exist to determine whether senior cats respond to vaccination as do younger cats. In the absence of data, healthy senior cats and those with stable chronic diseases should receive vaccinations as do younger cats. 80 In cats with acute disease, high fevers, or debilitation, vaccination should be delayed until the cat has recovered. 80 Vaccination of cats with chronic but stable illnesses may be done at the discretion of the veterinarian. Another common situation facing veterinarians is vaccination of cats on chronic corticosteroid therapy. Corticosteroids may cause suppression of immune responses, but studies evaluating vaccine efficacy and safety in cats receiving corticosteroids are lacking. The concurrent use of corticosteroids at the time of vaccination should be avoided when practical. 80 status is questionable. As with FPV, in FeLV-and FIVinfected cats and those that are immunocompromised, killed vaccines are recommended. Both the AAFP and WSAVA guidelines suggest giving the first booster at 1 year of age, followed by booster inoculations every 3 years (although the AAFP suggests considering additional boosters if the cat is going to enter a known high-risk situation, such as a boarding cattery). In contrast, the ABCD guidelines generally recommend annual boosters for FHV-1 in all but low-risk situations and boosters every 3 years for FCV. However, the ABCD defines low-risk cats as those that are kept strictly indoors and have no contact with other cats; it might be arguable as to whether these cats should be defined as low risk insofar as their lifestyle affords little or no exposure to respiratory viruses and therefore little or no opportunity for natural boosting of immunity.",

Although vaccination is highly efficacious, FPV remains a prevalent virus and all three feline vaccine guideline groups (FVGGs) recommend FPV as a core vaccine. In kittens vaccination should start as early as 6 to 8 weeks of age, and inoculations should be repeated every 3 to 4 weeks until the cat is 16 to 20 weeks of age. Giving a final vaccine at 16 to 20 weeks of age helps ensure optimal vaccine efficacy in those cats in which high levels of MDAs may prevent an effective response at an earlier age. Modified live vaccines should not be used in kittens younger than 4 weeks of age or in pregnant queens because of the risk of cerebellar damage in the developing brain. In high-risk situations, modified live injectable vaccines may provide a more rapid onset of immunity, whereas intranasal vaccines may be less effective. In FeLV-and FIV-infected cats and in immunocompromised cats, using a killed rather than a modified live vaccine is recommended.",

Vaccination is important in protecting cats from disease and reducing the severity of disease in infected cats, although it does not necessarily prevent infection with these viruses (partly because there are many different strains of FCV, and partly because of the inherent difficulty in inducing sterilizing immunity against these viruses). Vaccinated cats can also become carriers and pass infection to others. Because of the prevalent nature of these viruses and the severe disease they sometimes cause, all three FVGGs recommend these as core vaccines. Similar to FPV, recommendations are to start vaccination at 6 to 9 weeks of age and repeat every 3 to 4 weeks until 16 weeks of age. Early vaccination (from around 4 to 6 weeks of age) is particularly appropriate in high-risk situations or where MDA",

The AAFP states that this vaccine is not generally recommended, pointing out that although the vaccine (a temperature-sensitive modified live intranasal feline coronavirus [FCoV] vaccine) appears to be safe, significant questions have been raised regarding its efficacy, insofar as only cats seronegative (and potentially FCoVna\u00efve) are likely to respond to vaccination and show some protection. The vaccine is not licensed for use in kittens younger than 16 weeks of age, and kittens reared in environments where FCoV is endemic (i.e., the ones most likely to benefit from vaccination) are likely already to have been exposed to the virus at that age, making vaccination futile. The WSAVA similarly states that the FIP vaccine is not recommended, whereas the ABCD categorizes it as noncore and recommends that it be considered in kittens likely to be seronegative but that may subsequently enter a FCoV-endemic environment. The ABCD notes that vaccine-induced immunity is likely to be short-lived and recommends regular (annual) booster vaccinations when use is justified.",

Although vaccination may prevent or reduce the severity of clinical disease, and the onset of protection with the intranasal B. bronchiseptica vaccine may be very rapid, all three FVGGs recommend that these be regarded as noncore vaccines, with their use restricted to cats at risk of exposure in multicat environments (i.e., where these agents have been demonstrated to be endemic).

One of the major difficulties with the currently available FIV vaccine is that it induces an antibody response that is indistinguishable from that induced by natural infection, and thus vaccinated cats will yield positive results on routinely used serologic diagnostic tests (and vaccine-induced antibodies are known to persist for at least 12 months). Some questions also have been raised regarding the efficacy of the vaccine, and although cross-protection with other strains or clades of FIV has been demonstrated in some studies, 45, 46, 48, 75 the vaccine did not induce protection against a virulent United Kingdom-derived FIV isolate in one study, 23 and it has not been widely tested against European isolates of the virus. The AAFP has recommended the FIV vaccine be regarded as noncore, with use restricted to cats at high risk of infection, with antibody testing being carried out immediately before vaccination and vaccinated cats permanently identified as such (e.g., through microchipping). However, the WSAVA does not recommend the FIV vaccine, and the ABCD stipulates that the vaccine is not recommended in Europe for the reasons given. More information is still needed to reconcile some of the discrepancies among the recommendations of the three international FVGGs and to provide a greater evidence base for ongoing refinement and changes to these recommendations, but a growing international consensus is emerging regarding the way feline vaccines should be employed. It is also noteworthy that the AAFP has made recommendations about the site of administration of feline vaccines to help identify vaccines that may be associated with development of injection-site sarcomas and to enable more effective treatment of these on the rare occasions when they arise. The vaccine site recommendations are as follows:",
