Microscopic hematuria and non-nephrotic proteinuria are present in association with deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3. Serum complement may be transiently decreased. Diffuse proliferative GN is also acute and self-limited if the infection is eradicated. IgG, IgM, and C3 deposits are prominent in the mesangium and glomerular capillaries, and electron-dense deposits are present in mesangial, subendothelial, and subepithelial locations. The immune complexes deposited in the glomeruli may or may not contain bacterial antigens, and cryoglobulins may be present. Staphylococcal infections, particularly methicillin resistant, may induce diffuse proliferative GN, likely resulting from bacterial wall superantigens that induce a nonspecific polyclonal immunoglobulin response, with crescent formation and exclusive or predominant IgA deposition. The clinical presentation is the acute nephritic syndrome. Membranoproliferative GN (MPGN) is commonly observed with chronic infections. The clinical presentation is usually the nephrotic syndrome with microscopic hematuria and variable degrees of hypertension. Immunoglobulins and C3 deposits are present. In the setting of liver disease (as in Schistosoma mansoni infection), IgA may be a predominant component of the immune deposits. Membranous nephropathy (MN) is associated with chronic infections and presents as the nephrotic syndrome. Finally, vasculitis may develop in association with viral (especially hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus) or bacterial (rarely Streptococcus) infections.",

Traditionally, only certain nephritogenic strains of group A Streptococcus pyogenes result in GN. In the tropics and southern United States, PSGN usually follows streptococcal impetigo of M types 47, 49, 55, and 57. Throat infections with streptococcus types 1, 2, 4, and 12 are also nephritogenic. 3, 4 More recently, ingestion of unpasteurized milk contaminated with group C streptococcus (Streptococcus zooepidemicus) has caused clusters of cases and at least one large epidemic. 5 The risk of nephritis in epidemics may range from 5% in throat infections to as high as 25% in M type 49 pyoderma. A genetic predisposition is suggested as there is an association of PSGN with HLA-DR4 and DR1 and higher attack rates in siblings than expected for the general population. The risk of PSGN is reduced by early antibiotic treatment.",

In studies from Latin America and central Europe, SPEB but not GAPDH is usually detectable in renal biopsy specimens of PSGN patients. 9 In contrast, GAPDH was present in PSGN in a study of Japanese patients. 6 These contrasting results raise the interesting possibility that different streptococcal antigens are capable of inducing acute nephritis in different ethnic groups. Indeed, a study of the group C S. zooepidemicus strain that caused the epidemic outbreak in Brazil revealed an absence of the gene related to SPEB, which documents that this antigen was not involved in that epidemic. 10 PSGN is thought to occur when persistent streptococcal infection results in antigenemia and the development of circulating immune complexes that primarily deposit in the PSGN is becoming less common in industrialized countries and is changing its epidemiologic pattern from one that primarily affects children to one that now occurs more commonly in debilitated elderly individuals, particularly alcoholics, diabetics, and intravenous drug users. 2 Nevertheless, PSGN remains common in developing countries, where it may affect 9.3 to 9.8 cases per 100,000 population, 4 especially in communities with poor socioeconomic conditions. The reduction in incidence of PSGN likely relates to more rapid and frequent use of antibiotics. The common practice of fluorination of water may also be protective as fluoride reduces the expression of virulence factors in cultures of S. pyogenes.",

            "text": "Renal biopsy shows a diffuse endocapillary GN with proliferation of mesangial and endothelial cells (see Fig. 55 .3). There is glomerular and interstitial infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes. Glomerular accumulation of neutrophils is common and is termed exudative GN. Glomerular immune deposits of C3 (100% of the cases), IgG (62%), IgM (76%), and properdin and the terminal membrane attack complex C5b-C9 (85% of the cases, usually codeposited with C3) are seen in glomerular capillary loops and in the mesangium. A seminal work by Sorger and colleagaues 11 described three patterns of immunofluorescence in the glomeruli and their clinical correlations: the mesangial pattern of irregular and heavy immune deposits, the starry sky pattern of deposits scattered in mesangium and in capillary walls, and the garland pattern formed by gross deposits in the capillary loops (see Fig. 55 .3). The garland pattern is clinically relevant because it is associated with heavy proteinuria and a large number of electron-dense subepithelial immune deposits. Ultrastructural studies demonstrate the subepithelial humps, which are typical although not pathognomonic of PSGN as they may also be observed in postinfectious GN of other causes (classically endocarditis-associated GN secondary to Staphylococcus infection), cryoglobulinemia, and lupus nephritis. subendothelial and mesangial locations to initiate an inflammatory cascade with local complement activation and the recruitment of neu trophils and monocytes-macrophages. Subepithelial immune deposits (humps) develop because of the presence of cationic antigens (e.g., SPEB) or the dissociation of immune complexes in the subendothelial space with transit and re-formation on the outer aspect of the glomerular basement membrane. Cell-mediated immunity is supported by the presence of CD4 (helper) T lymphocytes. Cytokines also contribute to the local inflammation and injury. Urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 correlates with the severity of proteinuria in the acute phase of PSGN. Several issues remain unresolved. For example, immune complex disease generally results in activation of the classical complement pathway, yet in most cases, C4 levels are normal and only C3 is found in the deposits. This could be explained by the presence of antigens (such as GAPDH) that activate the alternative pathway. In some patients, C3Nef IgG antibodies have been demonstrated in sera that are capable of activating the alternative complement pathway. Activation of the lectin complement pathway by bacterial antigens has been postulated (see Chapter 16) , but individuals genetically unable to activate this pathway may still develop PSGN.",

The more significant changes observed in the epidemiology are the reduction in the proportion of cases associated with rheumatic heart disease and the increase in health care-associated cases. 16 Patients on chronic hemodialysis represent the most important subgroup, with 20 to 60 times the incidence in the general GN resolves by apoptosis of the excess cells. Residual renal injury is common, and biopsy specimens years later show variable degrees of focal glomerulosclerosis and mesangial expansion even in the absence of clinical disease. The clinical significance of these changes is undetermined.",

Widespread deposition of IgM, IgG, and C3 and electron-dense subendothelial, mesangial, and subepithelial deposits (which resemble poststreptococcal humps) are usually evident. In subacute endocarditis, focal segmental proliferative lesions with fibrinoid necrosis or capillary thrombi and mesangial immune deposits may be present. Tubulointerstitial cellular infiltration and variable degrees of atrophy and fibrosis may be seen. Intense eosinophilic infiltration should suggest another diagnosis, such as acute interstitial nephritis secondary to antibiotics. 17 The pathogenesis of endocarditis-associated GN involves the deposition of immune complexes containing bacterial antigens in glomeruli, a mechanism similar to that proposed for PSGN. Cryoglobulins (of the polyclonal or type III type) are present in 50% of subjects and may be found in glomeruli. Some bacteria (classically methicillin-resistant S. aureus) express superantigens that can also activate T cells directly and lead to a polyclonal gammopathy and immune complex GN (see later discussion).",

It is almost never observed in children and is rare in areas of the world where HBV infection is acquired at birth or in childhood, such as in Asia. The typical patient with HBV-related PAN presents with signs of serum sickness preceding and during a mild or asymptomatic attack of hepatitis, unlike HBV-associated serum sickness, which resolves spontaneously with clearing of the HBsAg. In these patients, the disease progresses to involve numerous organs. It typically involves medium-sized arteries and may present with a variety of presentations, including myocardial ischemia, mesenteric angina, cerebral ischemia, and mononeuritis multiplex. Renal vasculitis is manifested by microhematuria, nephrotic or non-nephrotic proteinuria, and renin-dependent hypertension. Manifestations are in general similar to those observed in noninfectious PAN, but patients with HBVassociated PAN more frequently have orchitis and gastrointestinal and renal vessel involvement, whereas pulmonary and cutaneous manifestations are rare. Rapidly progressive GN, as seen in microscopic polyangiitis, is infrequent in HBV-related PAN. 31 The pathogenesis of HBV-associated PAN is thought to be the deposition of HBsAg-antiHBs immune complexes in the arterial wall that results in a subsequent inflammatory reaction with the activation of complement. The vessels often show a predominance of IgM and HBsAg, suggesting that the injury is mediated by HBsAg-IgM complexes. Serologic tests reveal HBsAg and anti-HBc antibodies.

Whereas there is some evidence that this may be a cause of tubular dysfunction, there is no evidence that this results in glomerular injury. Rarely, however, CMV has been reported in nontransplant subjects to cause a diffuse proliferative GN with immune deposits containing CMV antigens. In addition, a rare report has linked CMV infection with collapsing glomerulopathy and ESRD in patients not infected with HIV. 34 Parvovirus B19 is a single-stranded DNA virus with marked tropism for the erythroid precursor cells. In conditions in which there is increased destruction or decreased production of red cells, parvovirus infection may cause aplastic anemia as in renal transplantation and in sickle cell disease. In patients with sickle cell disease, parvovirus-induced aplastic crises are occasionally followed by nephritic or nephrotic syndrome, assumed to be the result of immune complex deposition. Diffuse proliferative GN, MPGN, and collapsing focal glomerulosclerosis (with similarities to heroin-and HIV-associated nephropathy) have been attributed to parvovirus B19 infection, and some studies but not others have detected viral DNA in kidney biopsy specimens. Granular deposition of C3 and IgG in capillary walls and subendothelial deposits have been found. 35 Studies have also suggested a relationship between renal parvovirus infection and chronic allograft nephropathy. 36 A B C and microhematuria, are encountered in 25% to 50% of patients; a full-blown nephritic syndrome with hypertension, edema, and impaired renal function is uncommon. 40 Serum complement C3 and C4 may be consumed in such cases. Renal biopsy typically shows endocapillary proliferation with mesangial expansion and infiltration with pigment-laden macrophages and parasitized red cells. Platelet-fibrin thrombi and patchy necrosis of the tubules may be associated. Immunofluorescence shows granular deposition of IgM, C3, malarial antigens, and occasionally IgG. 41 Dense immune complex deposits, containing plasmodial antigens, are seen by electron microscopy (Fig. 55.8) .",

The disease typically affects children, usually 4 to 8 years old, and only rarely adults. It presents with heavy proteinuria and overt nephrotic syndrome, late-onset hypertension, and progressive kidney insufficiency. Despite the severe hypoproteinemia, the blood cholesterol level is often normal, presumably because of associated nutritional deficiency. Renal biopsy shows MPGN with intramembranous lacunae (due to reabsorption of immune com-plexes). Immunofluorescence shows coarsely granular IgG, IgM, and C3 deposits, and electron microscopy displays subendothelial electron-dense deposits (Fig. 55.9 ).
