            "text": "As pathogenic agents of respiratory and enteral diseases, coronaviruses often cause serious disease in livestock and humans. For instance, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, led to more than 8400 cases of infection in 2003, with a 10% fatality rate (Ziebuhr, 2004) . The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has recently been identified highly virulent, with a mortality rate of over 35% (Zaki et al., 2012; Memish et al., 2013) . SARS-CoV, classified under the genus \u03b2-Coronavirus, is a 5\u2032-capped, positive-sense, single stranded RNA virus. Its genome is approximately 29.7 kb long and encodes 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs). The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping ORFs, which encode two large polyproteins and produce 16 nonstructural proteins that play important roles during replication. The remaining 3\u2032 one-third of the genome comprises 12 ORFs that encode four structural proteins as well as eight accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b) (Yount et al., 2005) . These accessory proteins share no obvious homology to any known viral proteins. Therefore, their functions are still poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested that accessory proteins are important for virus-host interactions and are involved in protein incorporation into virus particles, apoptosis induction in the host cells, and modulation of the host's antiviral response (Lu et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007; Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007; Schaecher et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "Among all characterized accessory proteins, protein 6 (P6, ORF6) has attracted the most attention owing to its structure and function. P6 has been shown to be highly conserved in SARS-related coronaviruses iso-lated from many different animal species, ranging from bats to humans (Guan et al., 2003) . It is composed of 63 amino acids (aa), with a hydrophobic N-terminal region of ~40 aa and a hydrophilic C-terminal tail, and is localized in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/ Golgi membrane in infected cells (Zhou et al., 2010) . P6 has been suggested to be required for optimal replication of SARS-CoV and to improve the productivity of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Netland et al., 2007) . It has also been reported to interact with nonstructural protein 8 (nsp8) within the SARS-CoV replicase complex (Kumar et al., 2007) and to increase infection titer during early infection (Zhao et al., 2009) . Functional studies in host cells have suggested that P6 can increase the rate of cellular gene synthesis (Geng et al., 2005) and induce Caspase-3-mediated ER stress, as well as Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent apoptosis (Ye et al., 2008) . Interestingly, P6 has been shown to be involved in modulating host antiviral responses. It inhibits both the synthesis and signaling of interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) by suppressing the function of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter, and the translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) (Spiegel et al., 2005; Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007) . Furthermore, it antagonizes STAT1 function by sequestering nuclear import factors on the rough ER/Golgi membrane .",

Previous studies have shown that P6 is involved not only in virus replication and infection but also in host gene regulation and immune responses (Spiegel et al., 2005; Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007; Kumar et al., 2007; Netland et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2009) . To further explore the function of P6 and identify its host-cell binding partners involved in SARS-CoV infection, we employed a yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human spleen cDNA library purchased from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. for proteins that interact with P6. Fourteen positive clones were characterized and further analyzed to eliminate repeated sequences. Subsequently, eight host proteins were identified and these are shown in Table 2 .",

In addition, although single transfection of P6 exhibited a similar pattern to co-expression, since green spots were observed in both instances (Figure 2A, 2B) , P6 seemed to modify the subcellular localization of Nmi.

IFNs, as cytokines with great importance during host innate antiviral immune responses against invading pathogens, have become the target of a diverse range of viruses (Garcia-Sastre and Biron, 2006) . In many cell lines, SARS-CoV does not induce type I IFN production and seems to encode several proteins to suppress IFN signaling (Garcia-Sastre and Biron, 2006) . A previous study showed that P6 could bind to import factor karyopherin \u03b12 (KPNA2) and func- tion to disrupt nuclear import complex formation. Thus, P6 prevented the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and the downstream expression of STAT1-activated genes during IFN signaling, leading to failure of the host to establish an antiviral state (Garcia-Sastre and Biron, 2006) . Here, we propose a new mechanism by which SARS-CoV restricts IFN antiviral signaling through P6 activity. Based on our findings, we suggest that P6 may interact with host Nmi protein and induce its degradation, thus blocking the host antiviral immune response by inhibiting Nmi-stimulated activation of ISRE. Both of these mechanisms may be employed by P6 to suppress IFN signaling, but each has different target factors and steps during the signaling pathway. One mechanism specifically targets Nmi to induce its destruction, suppressing Nmienhanced IFN signaling; the other targets general nuclear import processes to block STAT1 nuclear translocation and hence downstream IFN signaling. It is possible these mechanisms represent two complementary methods to suppress IFN pathway induction. Interestingly, we found that the C-terminal 54 to 63 aa of P6 were critical for P6mediated Nmi ubiquitination and degradation, while the same region was also critical for P6 to block nuclear import, implying a link between these two functions of P6 during IFN signaling pathway suppression. Whether this connection is based on functional interplay or a co-regulating factor requires further investigation.",

Ebola virus VP24 can also restrain the nuclear translocation of STAT1 by binding to import factor karyopherin \u03b11 (KPNA1) and blocking the nuclear import complex (Reid et al., 2006) . The capsid protein of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is able to form a complex with the host proteins importin \u03b1/\u03b21 and CRM1; thus, blocking nuclear trafficking and modulating host transcription (Lundberg et al., 2013) . Similarly, there are many cases in which viruses utilize the ubiquitin proteasome system to degrade specific host proteins in order to suppress the host's innate immune system (Randow and Lehner, 2009 ). In the present study, we proposed that SARS-CoV P6 could promote host Nmi degradation, thus inhibiting the downstream IFN signaling pathway. However, it is not yet known whether Nmi can undergo ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal degradation during normal cellular processes. Further research is needed to reveal the role of ubiquitin modification in the functioning and regulation of Nmi in both the absence and presence of viral invasion.",

We showed that P6 may influence the subcellular localization of Nmi and is able to promote Nmi ubiquitination and degradation. However, we failed to detect any interaction of P6 with Nmi when conducting immunoprecipitation. One possible reason for this is that P6 localizes to the Golgi membrane, through its N-terminal 41 aa, but Nmi is mainly present in the cytoplasm (Zhou et al., 2010) . When Nmi interacts with P6 at its C-terminal cytoplasmic region, the interaction might be weak and could therefore be disturbed during the membrane disruption induced by the lysis buffer. Another possibility is that the interaction be-tween P6 and Nmi is transient and becomes rapidly disassociated after association, leading to negative results in the immunoprecipitation experiments. We also failed to obtain purified P6 for in vitro binding experiments. The question of whether the P6-Nmi interaction occurs during SARS-CoV infection was not addressed in this paper due to the use of WT SARS-CoV being strictly controlled and the unavailability of a valid anti-P6 antibody. The interaction between the innate immune response and SARS-CoV has been studied with great interest. IFNs not only modulate SARS-CoV infection of monocytes/macrophages but also affect the severity of the infection. It was found that the elderly are more susceptible to serious infection-related complications, which seem to be related to the fact that IFN-\u03b1 levels tend to be lower in older people . Treatment with IFN has been shown to lead to inhibition of SARS-CoV replication in Vero E6 cells (Hensley et al., 2004; Stroher et al., 2004) and decreased expression of SARS-CoV proteins in infected monkeys (Haagmans et al., 2004) . However, SARS-CoV has specific mechanisms by which it fights against the host IFN system. In contrast to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV could prevent IFN-\u03b2 production upon infection and can suppress IFN immune signaling through directly acting on host proteins via P6 (Spiegel et al., 2005) . IRF-3, the translocation of which from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is crucial for the activation of antiviral signaling, can be inhibited and detained in the cytoplasm by SARS-CoV P6 (Spiegel et al., 2005) . Here, we suggest a new potential mechanism by which SARS-CoV P6 suppresses the host IFN system by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of the host immune regulator, Nmi. The redundant functions of P6 may maximize its inhibitory role upon the host immune response during SARS-CoV infection. In addition, other studies have provided strong evidence that P6 can enhance SARS-CoV replication as well as its pathogenicity by interacting with host replication and assembly machinery (McBride and Fielding, 2012) . Therefore, the performance of rigorous functional studies of SARS-CoV P6 is particularly important for future understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and for developing novel anti-virus drugs.",
