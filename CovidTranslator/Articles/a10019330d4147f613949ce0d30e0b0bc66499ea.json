            "text": "More than 140 post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) are known to decorate cellular RNAs, but their incidence, identity and significance in viral RNA are still largely unknown. We have developed an agnostic analytical approach to comprehensively survey PTMs on viral and cellular RNAs. Specifically, we used mass spectrometry to analyze PTMs on total RNA isolated from cells infected with Zika virus, Dengue virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), poliovirus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1. All five RNA viruses significantly altered global PTM landscapes. Examination of PTM profiles of individual viral genomes isolated by affinity capture revealed a plethora of PTMs on viral RNAs, which far exceeds the handful of well-characterized modifications. Direct comparison of viral epitranscriptomes identified common and virus-specific PTMs. In particular, specific dimethylcytosine modifications were only present in total RNA from virus-infected cells, and in intracellular HCV RNA, and viral RNA from Zika and HCV virions. Moreover, dimethylcytosine abundance during viral infection was modulated by the cellular DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX6. By opening the Pandora's box on viral PTMs, this report presents numerous questions and hypotheses on PTM function and strongly supports PTMs as a new tier of regulation by which RNA viruses subvert the host and evade cellular surveillance systems.",

To date, \u223c140 post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) of the canonical ribonucleotides have been discovered (4, 5) , which contribute to the extraordinary structural diversity of natural RNA (6, 7) . At the molecular level, PTMs can affect the stability of individual base pairs and establish different hydrogen-bonding patterns to redefine the higher order structure of RNA (8, 9) . Moreover, PTMs influence intermolecular interactions involved in protein recruiting, DNA binding and recognition of other RNA. For instance, the absence of specific pseudouridines in rRNA of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae undermines the stability of the entire fold, which leads to disruption of ribosome assembly (10, 11) . Unmodified tRNAs are not loaded efficiently with their respective aminoacyl groups, and some modifications prevent incorrect loading altogether (12) . Hypermodified nucleotides in the tRNA anticodon loop can affect codon-anticodon interactions, which may impair the accuracy of RNA-RNA recognition and foster translational recoding (13) . Last, methylation of the terminal nucleotide protects siRNAs and microRNAs from 3 -uridylation that promotes nuclease binding and degradation (14) . The discovery of specific enzymes responsible for introducing, removing and interpreting PTMs (i.e. writers, erasers and readers, listed in the MODOMICS database) (15, 16) accounts for the dynamic nature of PTMs and sensitivity to the general health, epigenetic, and metabolic state of the cell.",

In Dengue virus (DENV), the 5 cap of the viral RNA is produced by methylation of the N7-guanosine and 2 -O-adenosine positions (17) . These modifications are introduced by the viral NS5 methyltransferase, which can also methylate the 2 -O position of internal adenosines in viral and cellular RNAs (18, 19) . The presence of N6methyladenosine (m 6 A) has been described in mRNAs of influenza and simian virus 40 (SV40) (20) (21) (22) , as well as in the genome of Rous Sarcoma virus (RSV) (23) . The function of this PTM in influenza and SV40 mRNAs is unknown, but is likely to involve modulation of RNA splicing in RSV (23) . Recent groundbreaking studies have shown that m 6 A can affect replication and stability of HIV-1 RNA, which demonstrated for the first time the impact of PTMs on specific steps of a viral lifecycle (24) (25) (26) . Similar m 6 A activities on viral RNA have been also described in human cells infected by Zika virus (ZIKV), DENV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (27, 28) . Although different flaviviruses, coronaviruses and rhabdoviruses are known to encode enzymes with methyltransferase activity (19, (29) (30) , cellular enzymes are largely responsible for installing and removing RNA modifications, thus suggesting that PTMs may play essential roles in determining virus-host interactions. Indeed, the addition of PTMs to disguise viral RNA as 'self' to elude host surveillance and promote structure within the viral RNA has already been described (31) (32) (33) .",

The availability of specific antibodies or the susceptibility to ad hoc chemical reagents has aided the identification of a handful of other PTMs, including N1-methyladenosine (m 1 A) (37) , cytosine-5-methylation (m 5 C) (38) , guanosine methylation (m 1 G and m 2 2 G (39) (40)), 2-O'-methylation (41) and pseudouridylation (42) . However, the investigation of the remaining known PTMs has been severely hampered by the chronic absence of suitable analytical tools. This obstacle could be overcome by the broader diffusion of mass spectrometric (MS) approaches, which analyze genuine RNA strands rather than the cDNA copies generated to complete RNA-seq analysis (43) (44) (45) . This type of platform enables the unequivocal characterization of any PTMs present on RNA according to unique mass and fragmentation features (46) (47) (48) . Indeed, MS analysis has been instrumental to the discovery of all known PTMs listed in the RNA Modification Database (4, 5) . Based on this platform, we have recently developed a robust approach for an agnostic analysis of PTMs at the whole transcriptome level (49, 50) . This comprehensive approach can reveal the effects of different environmental factors on the expression of the entire complement of modifications, including variations of distinct subsets contained in the cell, and thus enables the investigation of RNA modifications at a systems level (50) .",

            "text": "Based on rapidly emerging evidence of the ubiquitous presence of modifications in cellular RNA (1-3), we hypothesized that the regulatory roles attributed to m 6 A are shared by many other PTMs. To test this hypothesis, we employed our analytical approach to investigate the im-pact of viral infection on the entire epitranscriptome of the host cell. The variations of composition and expression levels in virus-infected cells versus mock-infected controls revealed the elements of a concerted response mounted by the host against viral infection. In investigating changes across different virus-host systems, we dissected general and virus-specific responses. Moreover, examination of viral genomes isolated by antisense-probe affinity capture offered the first comprehensive view of the extraordinary dimensions and diversity of viral epitranscriptomes. By comparing the modification landscapes of viral genomes extracted from cells and virions, our analyses suggest possible functions of PTMs during the infectious cycle. These observations prompted RNAi depletion experiments aimed at evaluating the effects of a cellular RNA DEAD-box helicase on the expression of RNA modifications, which revealed possible links between PTM biogenetic enzymes and ribostasis. This work aimed at obtaining an initial but comprehensive evaluation of the effects of viral infection on RNA modifications, which would lead to the identification of common and differentiating features across viruses, stimulate hypotheses on the functional significance of viral epitranscriptomes and provide a valid framework for supporting full-fledged mechanistic studies of their possible roles in virus-host interactions.",

The pellets were reconstituted in 5-30 l RNase free water (Sigma-Aldrich), depending on overall yields. RNA concentrations were determined by using UV 260 nm and adjusted to 40 ng/l. The RNA was then treated with nuclease P1 and phosphodiesterase to obtain the desired NMP mixtures for mass spectrometric analysis, as previously described (49, 50) . It is important to note that this analytical platform is capable of correctly discriminating NMPs from dNMPs based on their masses and fragmentation properties. The fact that no significant amounts of dNMPs were ever observed in these samples confirmed the ability of the ethanol precipitation step to eliminate not only the products of DNase 1 digestion, but also any pre-existing mononucleotides in the TRIzol extracts. This observation is consistent with the fact that ethanol precipitation tends to be several fold more efficient with polymeric than monomeric nucleic acid components, thus enabling mutual separation under proper conditions.",

            "text": "An essential first step toward understanding the role of RNA modifications in viral infection is to define the boundaries of the viral epitranscriptome. For this reason, we first examined the landscapes of PTMs of cell lines infected with five different single-stranded positive-sense [ss(+)] RNA viruses (see 'Materials and Methods' section). In particular, we determined the change in PTM composition and abundance upon infection with three viruses from the Flaviviridae family, representing two different genera: flavivirus (ZIKV and DENV) and hepacivirus (HCV). To determine whether the changes were unique to Flaviviridae or more ubiquitous to infection with ss(+) RNA viruses, we also examined the PTM profiles following infection with a picornavirus (PV), and a lentivirus (human immunodeficiency virus type 1, HIV-1). We performed a comprehensive investigation of PTMs on total RNA extracted directly from cell lysates, that is without fractionating the RNA into the individual classes of RNAs (see 'Materials and Methods' sec-Nucleic Acids Research, 2018, Vol. 46, No. 11 5781 tion). More specifically, total RNA was isolated by performing TRIzol extraction, DNase 1 digestion and then ethanol precipitation to eliminate unwanted DNA, as well as any pre-existing mononucleotides and soluble components, which may have been present in the initial extract (49, 50) . The intact RNA was then hydrolyzed into mononucleotide mixtures with specific exonucleases, and analyzed by directinfusion nanoflow ESI (nanoESI, 61,62) mass spectrometry (see 'Materials and Methods' section). We first assigned PTMs by searching the observed masses against a non-redundant index of all known PTMs, which was generated in-house by combining data present in the RNA modifications (http://mods.rna.albany.edu/) and MODOMICS (http://modomics.genesilico.pl/) databases. We then confirmed the database hits by gas-phase dissociation techniques, such as multistage tandem MS (MS n ) (63) and consecutive reaction monitoring (CRM) (64) , which provided structure-specific fragmentation signatures (43,46-47 and references therein). We have previously shown that this twostep identification process is capable of identifying all PTMs contained in the database, including isomeric species that differ only by the position of the modification group. This workflow completes both absolute and relative quantifications with typical sensitivity in the low attomol (10 \u221218 mol) range, quantification precision of \u00b17.1% RSD, and false discovery rate of 5.8% (49, 50) . The data presented in Table  1 were obtained by averaging the results of at least three biological replicates that were each analyzed five times (technical replicates; see 'Materials and Methods' section). The relative abundance of each PTM was calculated in relation to the total abundance of the canonical ribonucleotides (A, C, G and U) in the sample and expressed in percentage form (AvP; see 'Materials and Methods' section) (49) . The utilization of relative rather than absolute abundances, enabled self-consistent comparisons of PTM expression levels across samples, regardless of possible variations of their total RNA contents (49) . A color gradient was utilized to aid data interpretation and examination, whereas the corresponding numerical values are reported in full in Supplementary Table S2 . In comparing the relative abundances of an individual PTM detected in matched mock-and virusinfected samples, a different color was assigned only when the variation was statistically significant with a P-value < 0.05 (see 'Materials and Methods' section) (49) . The full names of the PTMs detected in these experiments were provided in Supplementary Table S3 .",

When examining the results against the information contained in the RNA Modification and MODOMICS databases, we immediately noted that 12 of the 47 PTMs had not been reported in human cell lines before (marked with * in Table 1 ). This observation highlights the chronic lack of data on the distribution of PTMs across different organisms and classes of RNAs (50) . In most cases, the leading databases cite only the first discovery of the PTM, typically in a certain organism and class of RNA and fail to report subsequent detection in other systems. Moreover, the vast majority of the known PTMs were discovered in isolated tRNA and rRNA, which are abundant sources of modified ribonucleotides, thus overlooking PTMs present on other types of RNAs in the same organism. In contrast, the data displayed in Table 1 were obtained from total RNA samples, not from isolated classes of RNAs. Therefore, the detection of previously unreported PTMs should not be surprising. The most abundant PTM in the sample was pseudouridine, which has been dubbed the fifth nucleotide for its abundance in natural RNA (expressed with a separate grey scale) (65), followed by a variety of singly methylated variants of the four canonical ribonucleotides (Table 1 ). In our analyses, m 6 A was just one of the 21 singly-methylated ribonucleotides identified in the sample, indicating that the methylome is significantly broader than is currently appreciated. We also detected variants containing multiple methyl groups suggesting that monomethylated species are not necessarily an end product, but may also serve as intermediates in more complex regulatory pathways involving successive methylation steps.",

In contrast, the common PTMs observed in such samples did not display equivalent proportions (Supplementary Table S2), thus downplaying possible dilution effects.

Conversely, 4 unique PTMs were detected in mock-infected cells, which were suppressed instead in all virus-infected samples (indicated in purple in Figure 1 : mcm 5 U, ncm 5 Um, mcmo 5 U and mchm 5 U; full names provided in Supplementary Table S3). At the same time, m 4 4 Cm was exclusively detected Tables S2 and S3 provide respectively full names and actual numerical values of relative abundance, expressed in relation to those of the canonical ribonucleotides detected in the same sample (49) . A cold-hot gradient covers relative abundances up to 1%, whereas shades of gray are assigned to values >1%. The different colors also express variations of relative abundance from the Huh7 column (mock-infected control) with a P < 0.05 statistical significance. An asterisk (*) indicates PTMs that to date have not been reported in mammalian systems in DENV; mnm 5 U was only in HCV; and m 5 D, hm 5 C, f 5 C, nm 5 U and mcm 5 s 2 U were only in PV-infected cells, while no unique PTM was identified in ZIKV-infected cells. Finally, the dimethylcytosine species m 5 Cm and m 4 4 C were consistently observed in ZIKV, DENV, HCV, and PV samples, but conspicuously absent in the mock-infected cells (indicated in light blue in Figure 1 ). Taken together, these data indicated that PTM landscapes are influenced by both virusspecific and non-specific factors. More significantly, the concerted appearance and disappearance of certain PTMs suggested that well-defined PTM regulatory pathways are operational in the host response to viral infection.",

We therefore compared viral infections in different cell lines to assess whether the same expression patterns would be replicated. Specifically, we compared ZIKV infections in Huh7 and HeLa cells; PV infections in Huh7, HeLa and 293T cells; and PV and HIV infections in 293T cells (Supplementary Tables S5-6 and Figures S2-3) . Control experiments carried out on mockinfected Huh7, HeLa and 293T cells identified a common Table S4 and Figure S5 . For the sake of simplicity, the diagram was based exclusively on the presence or absence of each PTM in the sample, whereas comprehensive quantitative data, which may help appreciate any up-and downregulation, are provided separately in Supplementary Table  S2 . Full PTM names are listed in Supplementary Table S3. set of 31 PTMs, which may constitute a manifestation of the common regulatory/metabolic infrastructure possessed by human cell lines (Supplementary Table S7 and Figure  S4 ). In ZIKV-infected Huh7 and HeLa cells, we identi- Table S5 and Figure S2 ). We similarly observed an increase or decrease of different sets of PTMs in 293T cells infected with PV or transfected with HIV-1 proviral DNA (Supplementary Figure S5 ). In the latter case, however, it is worth noting that transfection of HIV-1 proviral DNA does not represent a true infection, but rather the post-integration steps of viral replication, and it is therefore possible that the PTM profiles observed in these experiments may be incomplete. Regardless, these data showed that PTM landscapes were impacted by both the virus and cell line under consideration. The only exceptions were m 5 Cm and m 4 4 C, which were consistently detected in all virus-infected samples (i.e. ZIKV, DENV, HCV, PV and HIV-1), and absent in all mock-infected cell lines.",

Indeed, PTM of RNA is known to play an essential role in the cellular response to oxidative stress through tRNA-based translational recoding (66, 67) . Moreover, we recently showed that the PTM landscape of yeast is significantly affected by heat shock and osmotic stress through a mechanism that involves regulation of the mitogen- Table S10 . Full PTM names are listed in Supplementary Table  S3. activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (50) . In this study, however, we focused on conditions associated with the formation of stress granules, a cellular response common to ss(+) RNA virus infection (68) . Stress granules are cytoplasmic protein-RNA aggregates that assemble in response to environmental stressors, such as heat, nutrient deprivation and a viral infection. Because replication of ss(+) RNA viruses proceeds via the synthesis of a negative (\u2212) strand, a double-stranded (\u00b1) RNA replication intermediate forms and activates protein kinase R (PKR), a kinase that modulates the host innate immune response (69, 70) . Activated PKR phosphorylates eIF2\u2423 and stalls translation, and resulting stalled translation initiation-mRNA complexes, mRNAs and RNA binding proteins are sequestered in stress granules. Double-stranded RNA replication intermediates also initiate the innate immune response to induce synthesis of interferon (IFN) and subsequent expression of interferon stimulated genes (71) . We induced stress granule assembly either by treating uninfected Huh7 cells with sodium arsenite, or by transfecting them with the RNA analog polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], which mimics the host response to double-stranded replication intermediates (see 'Materials and Methods' section) (72) . We monitored the cellular response to arsenite by visualizing the formation of stress granules (data not shown) (56) , and evaluated the response to poly(I:C) by measuring the induction of firefly luciferase expression from an IFN-\u2424 promoter (Supplementary Figure S6) (73) .",

Conversely, 5 PTMs consistently appeared in mock-infected cells (i.e. ncm 5 Um, mcm 5 U, mcmo 5 U, mchm 5 U and i 6 A in Figure 2 ) and were absent from the poly(I:C)-treated and ZIKV-infected samples. In the case of arsenite, 12 additional PTMs were detected, which were absent in the poly(I:C) sample. Of these, m 5 Cm and m 4 4 C were in common with the ZIKV-infected sample, while mcm 5 s 2 U and f 5 Um were only identified in arsenite-treated cells. However, in comparing the PTM profiles after infection with the five ss(+) RNA viruses in the study, mcm 5 s 2 U was also identified in PV-infections, whereas f 5 Um was not identified in any viral-infected cells. (Figures 1 and 2) . The partial overlap between the arsenite-treated and virus-infected cells is not particularly surprising considering that arsenite is a potent inducer of oxidative stress resulting in mitochondrial damage (74, 75) , and that viral infections alter mitochondrial structure and function. For example, DENV and ZIKV have been shown to dampen the innate immune response by altering the structure of the mitochondria during infection (76) , whereas HCV infection induces oxidative stress and mitophagy (77) (78) (79) (80) (81) (82) and HIV may re-localize and damage mitochondria (83, 84) . Therefore, the incomplete overlap may reflect a common response resulting from mitochondrial damage, as well as separate cellular response pathways that are uniquely activated by oxidative stress or viral infection.",

The absence of characteristic features that distinguish cellular and viral RNAs from mere RNA homopolymers, such as terminal capping, highly-structured untranslated regions (UTRs) and polyadenylated tails, may contribute to explain the inability of poly(I:C) to elicit the same type of effects on the PTM profiles, as expressed in mock-and ZIKV-infected, and arsenite-treated Huh7 cells, where 7 PTMs were conspicuously absent in the poly(I:C) sample.

The captured RNA was similarly hydrolyzed into mononucleotides and analyzed according to the described workflow. The results showed that the genomes of all five viruses in the study were decorated with a plethora of different PTMs: 32 in ZIKV, 39 in DENV, 42 in HCV, 41 in PV and 36 in HIV-1 (see Supplementary Tables S8  and 9 ).

These PTMs were also detected in HIV-1 RNA captured from virions in extracellular media of transfected 293T cells (Supplementary Table S8 ). Smaller sets of PTMs were recog-nized, which were either partially shared between some of the viruses, or outright virus-specific (represented by dark and light blue cells in Table 2 , respectively). For example, viral RNA from ZIKV virions displayed 1 PTM (f 5 Um) that was also identified on viral RNAs from PV and HIV-1 virions. However, 11 PTMs were specifically identified on the ZIKV RNA from virions, and absent on the viral RNA from cell lysates. That virus-specific PTMs were detected on either the intracellular or virion RNA, or both, but not in mock-infected samples, raises the possibility that such PTMs might facilitate common steps in the viral infectious cycle, such as translation, replication, and virus assembly. Such specificity could warrant the utilization of PTMs as possible diagnostic markers for the respective viral infections.",

In considering these results, it should be noted that no RNA whatsoever was detected in capture samples obtained by exposing mock-infected lysates and corresponding culture media to the virus-specific antisense probes ( Supplementary Figure S7) . Explained by the absence of viral RNAs in noninfected material, this negative outcome confirmed the inability of the capture procedure to inadvertently pull down cellular RNA through non-specific interactions. In fact, the washing conditions described in 'Materials and Methods' section were sufficiently stringent to prevent the recovery of synthetic oligonucleotide standards that were not fully complementary to the probes, as well as limit that of oligonucleotides that were. This consideration is particularly important in light of the presence of abundant rRNA in cell lysates and the ability of virions to package different types of cellular RNAs (85, 86) .",

However, this PTM was detected not only on ZIKV and DENV isolated genomes, but also on HCV and PV genomes that are known to lack 5 caps (Supplementary Table S9 ). It should be noted that terminal m 7 G modifications are known to facilitate transport of mRNAs out of the nucleus and promote their translation. In contrast, the role of internal m 7 Gs is not understood, with the exception of guanosine 46 of yeast tRNA, which has been shown capable of modulating structure and promoting additional tRNA modifications (87) . The current experimental workflow relies on digesting polymeric RNA into mononucleotide components and, thus, cannot differentiate between terminal and internal m 7 G modifications. Therefore, additional work aimed at locating the position of m 7 G on the viral RNA will be necessary to support a full-fledged functional elucidation.",

Nevertheless, PV genomes isolated from cells contained the highest amount of Am. Recently, the m 6 A eraser FTO was shown to preferentially convert m 6 Am to Am (88) . While ZIKV, DENV, HCV, PV and HIV-1 RNA genomes contain m 6 A (Supplementary  Table S9 and refs. (24-28)), it remains to be determined whether the presence of Am on viral genomes might be the result of the activity of FTO, or an unknown adenosinespecific 2 -O methyltransferase. To date, the only known bona fide 2 -O methyltransferases in humans methylate the 2 -O position of adenine, guanine, and uridine (88, 89) . Our data showed that Cm and Um on ZIKV, DENV, HCV and PV intracellular and virion genomes manifested with similar abundances, while Gm was significantly lower (Supplementary Figure S8 ).",

            "text": "The detection of m 6 A on all viral RNAs in our study was consistent with recent reports that this PTM decorates the genomes of HIV, HCV, ZIKV and DENV (24) (25) (27) (28) . Based on the relative abundance of this PTM in ZIKV RNAs (Supplementary Table S11 ), we estimated an average overall incidence of \u223c11.4 m 6 A modifications per genome in viral RNAs captured from virions, which compares favorably with the 12 m 6 As per genome reported for virionextracted RNA by Lichinchi et al. (28) . Similarly, we estimated an incidence of \u223c27.6 and \u223c13.6 m 6 As per genome for HCV and DENV RNAs captured from intracellular versus 19 and 11 reported by Gokhale et al. (27) . At the same time, we detected \u223c10.8 and 5.4 m 6 A modifications per genome on PV RNA isolated from cell lysates and virions, respectively, for which there are no available data from alternative sources. The agreement between these statistics is particularly remarkable in light of the different types of cells and growth conditions employed between studies, as well as the fundamental difference between the selected analytical approaches: one involving the direct analysis of genuine RNA samples; the other relying on reverse transcription and amplification of RNA that was immunoprecipitated by m 6 A-specific antibodies (27, 28) . Table S10 ). We could therefore hypothesize that m 5 Cm and m 4 4 C may be installed on cellular RNAs that modulate the infectious cycles of these viruses. A possible strategy for testing this hypothesis would be to deplete or knock-out the writer enzymes responsible for the installation of m 5 Cm and m 4 4 C, and then examine the effects on the viral lifecycle. However, as is frequently the case in epitranscriptomics research, the identities of their writer, eraser and reader enzymes are still unknown in human cells; however they have been identified in E. coli (90) . Based on the excellent homology between the E. coli RsmH and Homo sapiens METTL15 methylating enzymes (91) , the latter was employed as input information in a comprehensive bioinformatics search aimed at identifying key nodes of RNA pathways, which could be manipulated to probe the role of dimethylcytosine modifications in viral infection (see 'Materials and Methods' section). Among the putative pathways returned by the search, the most promising one identified a possible link between key components of the mRNA decapping complex and m 5 Cm/m 4 4 C biogenesis. The most prominent of such components was the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX6, a protein that is at the nexus of numerous RNA metabolism pathways. Furthermore, this protein can affect gene expression in different RNA viruses, including HCV and HIV-1 (56, (92) (93) ; is a suppressor of abnormal interferon-stimulated gene expression (94) ; and has been found, perhaps not coincidentally, to localize in the stress granules mentioned above (95) .",

            "text": "The possible impact of DDX6 on m 5 Cm/m 4 4 C biogenesis during viral infection was initially explored by using target-specific siRNA to silence its production in Huh7 cells, which were subsequently mock-or virus infected. At specific times post-infection, we examined the effect of depleting DDX6 on viral titers and gene expression, as well as the expression of m 5 Cm and m 4 4 C in virus-infected cells ( Figure 4) . These experiments showed that m 5 Cm and m 4 4 C were not detected in cells treated with transfection reagent alone (data not shown), in mock-infected cells, in mockinfected cells depleted of DDX6 or following rescue with 3xFlag-DDX6 si (Figure 4 ). In contrast, siRNA-depletion of DDX6 significantly decreased HCV and ZIKV RNA, protein abundance and viral titers, but had little effect on DENV or PV RNA ( Figure 4) . Moreover, in all virus infections, depletion of DDX6 significantly decreased m 5 Cm and m 4 4 C levels to the point of being undetectable (Figure 4) . At the same time, the levels of m 5 Cm and m 4 4 C were almost completely restored when a plasmid encoding a siRNA-resistant 3xFlag-tagged version of DDX6 was transfected into cells depleted of DDX6 ( Figure 4) . The data showed excellent correlation between the abundance of m 5 Cm/m 4 4 C and that of DDX6, thus suggesting a possible relationship between the biogenesis of m 5 Cm/m 4 4 C and DDX6. In this direction, it should be pointed out that DDX6 possesses intrinsic RNA-binding, ATPase and helicase activities (95) , but lacks a methyltransferase domain and, thus, is not likely to play a direct enzymatic role in m 5 Cm/m 4 4 C biogenesis. It was recently shown, however, that the nuclear helicase DDX46 was capable of binding the m 6 A eraser enzyme ALKBH5 via the helicase domain, which induced demethylation of select interferon stimulated genes in response to vesicular stomatitis virus infection (96) . Additionally, the ability of DDX6 to suppress anomalous expression of interferon genes supports an involvement in regulating the innate immune response of the host cell (94) . Since DDX6 affects gene expression in both ZIKV and HCV, but not in DENV and PV (Figure 4, (54,56) ), it is possible that DDX6 might similarly interact with writer, eraser or reader enzymes to modulate m 5 Cm/m 4 4 C modifications and expression of virus-specific interferon-stimulated genes. Therefore, understanding the relationship between DDX6 and m 5 Cm/m 4 4 C biogenesis could potentially help elucidate how viral RNA eludes innate immune response, which will be the object of future investigation.",

These data also showed for the first time that DDX6 similarly modulated ZIKV gene expression. In contrast to earlier reports (94, 97) , we found that depletion of DDX6 did not affect levels of DENV capsid, genomic RNA or viral RNA. Although these discrepancies could be due to different viral replication efficiencies, permissiveness between different cell passages and Huh7 lines (98, 99) , and efficiency of siRNA knockdown, the observed decrease of m 5 Cm/m 4 4 C in all virus-infected cells clearly supports the ability of DDX6 to modulate the expression of these PTMs' biogenetic enzymes. The fact that m 5 Cm and m 4 4 C were detected on ZIKV and HCV RNAs isolated from virions, as well as intracellular HCV RNA, but were not observed at all on viral RNAs of DENV, PV and HIV-1 (either virion or intracellular), may be due to the timing of their capture from the initial samples. It is also possible that, at least in DENV and PV, these PTMs might decorate the negativestrand intermediates synthesized during replication. In the case of both ZIKV and HCV, the expression patterns observed for m 5 Cm and m 4 4 C are consistent with the presence of a unique, but common mode of regulation, which is operational during viral infection. Although the current data are not sufficient to draw firm conclusions, the range of possible hypotheses generated by these observations provides strong motivations for a full-fledged-mechanistic investigation.",

The results exposed for the first time the remarkable dimensions and diversity of the viral epitranscriptome, which far exceed the handful of modifications reported thus far (100, 101) . Despite the well-established effects of some PTMs on RNA structure and their implication in maintaining cellular homeostasis (3, 102) , PTMs have been often perceived as mere passengers introduced in a stochastic fashion by the cellular machinery, or as non-specific components of general mechanisms of stress response. The fact that we observe considerable differences between PTM landscapes of mockversus virus-infected cells, as well as between the landscapes associated with five different viruses, negates these perceptions. In determining the distribution of PTMs on cellular versus viral RNAs, as well as intracellular versus virionpackaged genomes, our study establishes the foundation to probe the boundaries of the viral epitranscriptome and traces possible roadmaps for elucidating PTM functions and regulation. Our study highlighted also the need to investigate not only the functions of individual PTMs, but also their uncharted synergies at the systems level.",

            "text": "The interpretation of the wealth of data generated by these experiments poses numerous challenges, as well as opportunities, which must be addressed in the context of the still limited but steadily growing knowledge of the functions of RNA modifications. The identification of common sets of PTMs, which are present not only in mock-, but also in virus-infected cells and isolated viral RNAs, suggests their possible implication in mechanisms by which viral genomes disguise as cellular RNAs to elude cellular surveillance. To this effect, 2 -O methylation of the penultimate nucleotide on cellular RNAs is known to prevent recognition by IFIT1 and to inhibit RNA degradation and turnover (103, 104) . ZIKV and DENV encode a methyltransferase responsible for introducing this modification on viral RNA (105,106), which helps ensure efficient translation of viral proteins and camouflages viral RNA from the cellular defense mechanisms against foreign RNA. In contrast, HCV and PV lack methyltransferase activity and are known to achieve similar goals through different means. In particular, these two viruses regulate translation via a cap-independent mechanism mediated by an internal ribosome entry site, which prevents IFIT1 detection and activation of the innate immune response pathway (107) . In analogy with 2 -O methylation, some or all of the other 22 common PTMs found in virus-infected samples, isolated viral genomes and mockinfected controls could potentially contribute to camouflaging the viral RNA as 'self' to protect against the cell's innate immune response. Indeed, the presence of m 6 A and s 2 U, and to a lesser extent m 5 C, pseudouridine, and m 5 U, decreases the activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) by RNA, which leads to a decrease of the host innate immune response (31) . Additionally, the presence of m 6 A and pseu-douridine in viral RNA was recently shown to attenuate the activation of the RIG-I innate signaling pathway (33) . With the sole exception of s 2 U, we observed all of these immunity-reducing PTMs during viral infection, thus supporting the possibility that ss(+) RNA viruses take advantage of this evasion mechanism. Because the response to infection by single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses is largely regulated at the mRNA level (71) , future studies will have to address the composition and dynamics of PTMs on cellular mRNAs, which will be expected to provide new insights into the activation and regulation of antiviral response pathways. The ability of viral genomes to acquire the same types of modifications present on cellular RNAs may also facilitate the recognition of the viral RNA by enzymatic complexes involved in RNA processing and trafficking. For example, the presence of m 6 A on HIV-1 RNA promotes export of the viral RNA out of the nucleus (24) . The ability of viruses to mimic the PTM profiles on cellular RNAs may explain the extraordinary efficiency by which viruses usurp the host metabolic machinery. At the same time, however, the identification of virus-specific PTMs supports distinctive virus-host interactions, which do not parallel the regular interactions involving cellular RNAs. Further investigation of these sets of PTMs will be expected to provide new data on the mechanisms of viral adaptation to the host environment and subversion of cellular regulatory pathways.",

The absence of direct knowledge on m 5 Cm/m 4 4 C biogenesis in humans gave us the opportunity to evaluate a general bioinformatics strategy for identifying possible intersections between viral processes and PTM regulatory pathways. Guided by this information, RNAi depletion of DDX6 revealed that interfering with decapping of cellular mRNA and microRNA gene regulation altered significantly the PTM landscapes, which may in turn affect the translation/stability of specific interferon-induced antiviral mRNAs (108) . Considering the potential therapeutic implications, this preliminary examination of the putative DDX6/dimethylcytosine interaction provided a strong rationale for pursuing full-fledged mechanistic studies. At the same time, it also demonstrated the benefits of using the most comprehensive information possible to shape any divide-and-conquer strategy and to prioritize putative targets for follow-up investigations. It has become clear that the breadth of this systematic approach can significantly outpace the current knowledge of cellular factors regulating PTMs. Therefore, identifying the actual writers, erasers, and readers will be essential to sustain the advancement of the new and exciting field of viral epitranscriptomics.",
