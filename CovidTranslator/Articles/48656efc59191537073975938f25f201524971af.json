The median time from onset to admission of severe patients and mild patients was similar, but the severe patients deteriorated on 7-14 days of illness course and developed to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. The severe or death patients with 2019-nCoV infection were mostly old age with comorbidities. 7 In the study, severe ill ones are all over 50 years old. The decrease of lymphocyte count was related to the progress of the disease. we proposed that blood lymphocyte related index may be a potential predictor. The NLR was a widely used marker for the assessment of the severity of bacterial infections and the prognosis of patients with pneumonia and tumors. The increase of NLR indicated poor clinical prognosis. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The results indicated that 2019-nCoV may act on T lymphocytes, and T lymphocyte damage is an important factor that causes patients to deteriorate 13 . In addition, patients with severe illness might have bacterial infection due to low immune function. The latest report followed up the laboratory test results of patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and found that 5 patients had a rising neutrophil count and a falling lymphocyte count before their deaths. 6 In the study, the data of 61 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia were analyzed, the baseline characteristics of patients in the mild and severe groups were described and compared, and the dynamic changes of laboratory indexes and imaging were demonstrated. The independent risk factors affecting incidence of severe illness were screened. The results showed that NLR was the most significant factor affecting the severe illness incidence, and it had significant predictive value. Furthermore, according to the NLR and age stratification, the incidence of severe ill ones with NLR \u2265 3.13 and aged \u2265 50 years old was 50%, and 9.1% in age \u2265 50 and NLR < 3.13 patients.",

[16] [17] [18] In the study, NLR was compared with MuLBSTA and CURB-65 scoring models, the results showed that NLR had higher AUC, c-index, sensitivity and specificity, which indicated that NLR was better than the other two models in early predicting the incidence of severe illness. Furthermore, it was found that the prediction effect of the NLR-MuLBSTA and NLR-CURB-65 models was better than that of the original model. But NLR was an easy-to-use predictor index.",
