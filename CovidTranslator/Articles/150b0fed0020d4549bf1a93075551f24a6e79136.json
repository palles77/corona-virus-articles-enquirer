From a comparative perspective, the analysis has led to the conclusion that the rise and fall of traditional medicine is an issue closely related with social and political issues; and the development of traditional medicines requires national policy and financial support from governments, human resource development, the improvement of service quality, and the dissemination of traditional medicine knowledge to the public. In addition, this paper also suggests deepening exchanges and cooperation between China and Thailand, strengthening cooperation between traditional medicine and medical tourism.",

The Kingdom of Thailand also has its own system of traditional medicine which is called \"Thai traditional medicine\" (TTM) and it had been a means of national health care for the Thai people until the early 20th century. 3 Among the TMs in the world, there are Chinese, Korean, Japanese traditional medicines which originated from ancient China.

Both China and Thailand are developing countries with similar climatic and geographical environment. Both countries are rich in medical resources and have distant historical and cultural backgrounds. Besides, there have been many overseas Chinese people in Thailand for a long time and TCM has been accepted and developed in Thai society. The TM of China and Thailand differ in their origins, academic thinking, theoretical system and diagnostic method. And yet, the modern development of these two medicines strikingly manifests a historical similarity: The spread of modern medicine from the Western world to the East led to a decline in the practice of traditional medicine both in Thailand and China. Based on a secondary analysis of available literature, this paper aims to do comparative studies between TCM and TTM, and concentrates on two crucial historical developments: (1) the response to, and consequences of, the impact of the Western medicine; and (2) the revival of traditional medicine in these two countries and its prospects. In this ever-changing globalization age, the practical significance of the comparison is to discover the objective laws of the development of TM, to fully identify the similarities and differences between the two medicines, to create a necessary platform for securing cultural sensitivity and enhancing mutual understanding and cooperation between the two countries.

They are thought to be essential to healthy living and development of TCM. TCM originated from the legendary clan leader Fu Xi (2593 BC) period, established its theoretical system during the late years of the Warring States period to Chin and Han dynasties (475 BC-AD 220). 6 So t he Comprehensive academic system of TCM had been formed more than 2500 years. During the Jin and Tang dynasties (265 AD-907 AD), TCM experienced great development and absorbed much medical information from Arabian countries, Japan and India. During the Song and Yuan dynasties (960 AD-1368 AD), the invention of printing technology and further advances in papermaking caused TCM to spread widely and to be deeply researched. During the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368 AD-1911 AD), every part of TCM was enriched and TCM spread to the countries of Europe and the Americas. From the beginning of the Opium War in 1840, China was continually defeated by outside forces. There were some Chinese people who, as a result of the national crisis, developed a cultural inferiority complex and produced a tide of complete opposition to their own culture. Western medicine took root, and Chinese medicine went into a hundred year decline.",

In addition, traditional knowledge of TTM was also built through the processes of \"selection\", \"adoption\", \"adaptation\" and \"utilization\" of traditional medicine of some countries with which Thailand had contact in the past, e.g., India and China, to suit the Thai way of life. TTM knowledge was gradually developed, systematized, revised, recorded, and passed on from generation to generation throughout the country's history, from Sukothai to Ayutthaya (1350-1767), Thonburi (1767-1782), and the early Rattanakosin period (1782-1916), as a means of health care for the Thai people. After Burma destroyed Ayutthya in 1767, Kings Rama I-III of the present Chakri Dynasty played an important role in the revival of TTM. Over 1000 drug recipes and the body of knowledge of TTM regarding the origin of diseases and their treatments were gathered and inscribed on marble tablets and placed on the walls of two temples, namely Wat Po and Wat Raja Oros. The purposes of the Kings' orders were to compile collective knowledge of TTM that was partly lost or destroyed during the Burmese-Siamese War (1765-1767) and to give health education to the Thai people so that they could take care of their health using TTM. Unfortunately, the influence of Western medicine, which was introduced into Thailand by missionaries and western physicians since the reign of King Rama III (1787-1851), gradually increased and eventually led to the abandonment of the systematic teaching of TTM in the medical school in 1916. This sparked the decline in TTM acceptance, especially among people in the urban areas, and the status of TTM practitioners in the country's health care system for over 60 years.",

            "text": "TCM is based on the view that man and the universe are one unity or, in other words, the relation between man and nature is harmonious. According to TCM, people become ill because they do not know the laws of nature, of society, or of relations among people. So TCM aims for balances in three major aspects because all illnesses are caused by imbalance. This is rather similar to the Galenic medicine in ancient Rome and Greece. The three balances are balance between man and nature, balance between an individual and the society, balance between the functions of the body organs. TCM is a dialectical and dynamic system which integrates theories such as the theories of yin and yang (the positive and negative forces, they not only depend on each other and oppose each other, but also tend to transform and alternate in waxing and waning), and wuxing (the five elements -water, fire, metal, wood and earth, the relations between them are inter-promotion, interaction, over-action and counter-action), and jingluo (Channels and Collaterals), of visceral manifestation, of treatment based on the differentiation of symptoms and signs, of pharmacology, of acupuncture and moxibustion, etc. The theoretical system explored in the earliest-extant Huangdi Neijing remains the mainstay of TCM up to this day. 6 Huangdi Neijing, the theoretical work on TCM that emerged in the Warring States Period (475-221 B.C.), marks the establishment of Chinese medicine's unique theoretical system. Another classic work, Shennong's Herbal Classic sums up medical experiences prior to the Qin (221-207 B.C.) Dynasty, records 365 varieties of medicinal herbs and it is the earliest pharmacopoeia ever found in China.",

These elements are called as \"tards\" in Thai language, which are the very essence of human life. In order to stay healthy, the four elements must be in perfect balance and harmony, and TTM seeks to restore health by overcoming imbalances in the system. TTM also states that everyone has one's own dominant element called \"tard-chao-ruan\" in Thai language, which is basically determined by the date and month of one's conception. The tard-chao-ruan of a person plays an important role with regard to one's characteristics and appearance as well as the weak point in one's health (Vichai and Anchalee). 10 According to TTM, the seasons, age, geography, time and behavior can affect one's health as well. Illness can be caused by supernatural powers (ancestor souls, evil spirits, and punishment from spirits for misbehavior), powers of nature (imbalance of tards, imbalance of hot and cold, imbalance of body equilibrium), powers of the universe (influence of sun, moon and stars) and Kimijati, which is the equivalent of microorganisms or parasites. 10 During the reign of King Narai the Great (1656-1688), the doctors that served the king united to compile a textbook of King Narai's medicines or Tamra Phra Osod Phra Narai, which was the first official textbook of Thai drug recipes. During the reign of King Rama V (1868-1910), the first medical textbook Tumra Paetsart Sonkrau and the first Thai national formulary called Tumra Paetsart Sonkhrau Chabub Luang as well as Tumra Vejasuksa, the first TTM textbook for medical students, were published. They are still official textbooks of TTM accepted by the Thai Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the registration of traditional medicines.",

Observation is the method to see the patient's expressions, complexion, physique, posture, tongue and the fur on it and the color of secretion and excrement in order to know the situation of the internal organs. Auscultation and olfaction are the method to listen to the patient's sounds and to smell the odor of his/her breath and discharge. The change of his/her sounds through his/her talking, breathing and coughing and his/her odor can tell chills, fever, hypo function and hyper function. Interrogation is the method to inquire the patient or his/her companions about the onset, the cause and course of the illness, the chief complaints (especially pain), the past history, the living habits and other relevant conditions. As to palpation, pulse feeling is the chief item. 2 Bagang (eight principles) are important principles of treatment of TCM. They are yin and yang, exterior and interior, cold and heat, deficiency and excess. In spite of the complexity of diseases, they could be basically summed up into bagang. Of bagang, yang includes exterior, heat and excess while yin covers interior, cold and deficiency. Whenever there is a correct analysis of bagang, there will be precise diagnosis and a satisfactory treatment. 6 Last but not least, TCM puts emphasis on \"curing illnesses that have not yet happened rather than curing illness\". Guan Qingwei, the director of Tongrentang Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic stated that by improving people's health at the \"pre-illness\" stage, TCM helps people avoid illness in the first place and when illness does come, TCM will stop it from becoming worse or cure it. 11 During its long practice and evolvement, TCM has developed a complete and independent theoretical system and unique and effective methods of clinical treatment centering on Chinese herbal medicines, supplemented by acupuncture and moxibustion, medical massage and qigong, that is, deep breathing exercises.",

Besides, based on the \"tards\" principle, TTM practitioners need to know a patient's date, time, month and year of birth in order to figure out the patient's \"tard-chao-ruan\" and determine which element is causing the imbalance and illness. Then a diagnosis is made to treat a patient with some practitioners also performing an astrological examination as well. Treatment of TTM also emphasizes adjusting the balance of the body elements using the health promotion approach. Naturally determined factors, such as the \"tard-chao-ruan\", seasons, external elements and the power of the universe, are also considered in order to give appropriate treatments.

Its message was simple: there were almost no traditional doctors left, and that without immediate action, it would be impossible to assemble any teaching staff and the last of the living practitioners would be dead. Again, the central government took note, and a memo was sent throughout the country to support TCM. The Central Secretariat put forward the policy called \"lay equal stress on TCM and Western medicine\" after the Cultural Revolution. 13 In 1979, the National Association for Chinese Medicine was established, and many of the traditional texts underwent editing and were republished. 12 In 1988, in order to strengthen the management of traditional medicine, the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of the People's Republic of China was set up and under the control of the Ministry of Health. In the last few decades, while TCM has existed in a fragile state, hope has also sprouted as interest in it grows both in China and abroad.",

Besides, following the development of modern science and philosophy, there have been some medical specialists in both the East and West who also believe that TM will open a new pathway for Western medicine. It is likely that in the future this will bring about a new phase in the work of unearthing and researching TM. There is also continuing interest in the pharmacology of natural medicines known to be effective to identify the active compounds. It is definitely a milestone in development of TM that WHO is incorporating TM into the 11th version of its International Classification of Disease (ICD-11). 4 The ICD-11 project will promote the integration of Western and traditional medicines and provide a better health care system to the world.

This clearly showed the commitment of the government to promote TTM as another means of health care for the Thai people. On 12 June 2007, the Cabinet approved \"National Strategic Plan on the Development of 'Tai' Wisdom, 'Tai' Ways of Health B.E. 2550-2554 (2007-2011)\" which determines the directions and the roles of indigenous medicine, TTM and alternative medicine in the national health system and requires the participation from various sectors involved to implement the plan. This National Strategic Plan is composed of five strategies, namely: knowledge development and management, development of health service system, human resource development, TTM and herbal medicines development, protection of Thai traditional knowledge related to TTM and Thai herbs.",
