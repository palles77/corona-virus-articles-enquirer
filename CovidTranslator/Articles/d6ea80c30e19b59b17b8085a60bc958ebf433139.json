The patatin domain has subsequently been found in bacteria and animals. An extensive family of human patatin domaincontaining proteins have been identified: patatinlike phospholipase domain-containing protein 1 (PNPLA1, 532aa) is a lipid hydrolase, PNPLA2 (EC 3.1.1.3, adipose triglyceride lipase, calcium-independent phospholipase A2, desnutrin, pigment epithelium-derived factor, transport-secretion protein 2, 504aa) catalyzes the initial step in triglyceride hydrolysis in adipocyte and non-adipocyte lipid droplets. PNPLA6 (neuropathy target esterase, EC 3.1.1.5, 1366aa) is defective in a form of spastic paraplegia. Research article: http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/150/3/522 patch clamp A specialized and powerful variant of the voltage clamp method, in which a patch electrode of relatively large tip diameter (5 \u03bcm) is pressed tightly against the plasma membrane of a cell, forming an electrically tight, 'gigohm' seal. The current flowing through individual ion channels can then be measured. Different variants on this technique allow different surfaces of the plasma membrane to be exposed to the bathing medium: the contact just described is a 'cell-attached patch'. If the electrode is pulled away, leaving just a small disc of plasma membrane occluding the tip of the electrode, it is called an 'inside-out patch'. If suction is applied to a cell-attached patch, bursting the plasma membrane under the electrode, a 'whole cell patch' (similar to an intracellular recording) is formed. If the electrode is withdrawn from the whole-cell patch, the membrane fragments adhering to the electrode reform a seal across the tip, forming an 'outside-out patch'.",

All, regardless of class or species, are composed of two different domains: an unconstrained prolinerich domain of variable length and relatively low conservation, and a well-conserved disulphide bondstabilized cysteine-rich domain. The C-terminal cysteine-rich domain of penaeidins resembles a motif found in several chitin-binding proteins isolated from plants and confers chitin-binding capacity.

The life-cycle is complex and involves an intermediate host, the female mosquito (Anopheles) that infects vertebrate host when taking a blood meal. Predominant form of the organism in humans is the intracellular parasite (the merozoite) in the erythrocyte, where it undergoes a form of multiple cell division termed schizogony. As a result the erythrocyte bursts and the progeny infect other erythrocytes. Eventually some cells develop into gametes that, when ingested by a female mosquito, will fuse in her gut to form a zygote (ookinete). Multiple cell division within the resultant oocyte, attached to the gut wall, gives rise to infective sporozoites; these migrate to the salivary glands and are ejected with the saliva the next time the mosquito takes a blood-meal.",

They also mediate mechanosensing in the primary cilia (monocilia) of kidney cells. Similar proteins (for example polycystic kidney disease protein 1-like 1, 2849aa) are found in other tissues and there are homologues in C. elegans (location of vulva defective 1, 3330aa, which also localizes to cilia and the ciliary base and is involved in male mating behaviour).

An increase in the haemoglobin content of the blood, either as a result of decreased plasma volume or an increase in red cell numbers (erythrocytosis). In polycythaemia vera (Vaquez-Osler disease) there is increased production of erythrocytes as a result of somatic mutation in the JAK2 gene in a single haematopoietic stem cell. Familial erythrocytosis can be caused by mutation in the erythropoietin receptor gene or the VHL tumour suppressor gene.",

Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers, which are complementary to two regions of the target DNA to be amplified (one for each strand), are added to the target DNA sample, in the presence of excess deoxynucleotides and Taq polymerase, a heat-stable DNA polymerase. In a series (typically 30) of temperature cycles, the target DNA is repeatedly denatured (at around 90 C), annealed to the primers (typically at 50260 C) and a daughter strand extended from the primers (72 C). As the daughter strands themselves act as templates for subsequent cycles, DNA fragments matching both primers are amplified exponentially, rather than linearly. The original DNA need thus be neither pure nor abundant, and the PCR reaction has accordingly become widely used not only in research, but in clinical diagnostics and forensic science.

Protocadherin 11 exists in two forms, one encoded on the X-chromosome, (PCDH11X, 1347aa), the other on the homologous region of the Y chromosome (PCDH11Y, 1340aa). Protocadherin 15 (1955aa) is expressed in stereocilia of the inner ear and in retinal photoreceptors. Together with cadherin 23 (otocadherin) forms tip links, extracellular filaments that connect the stereocilia and are thought to gate the mechanoelectrical transduction channel. Mutations cause Usher Syndrome 1F. Defects in PCDH19 are the cause of female-restricted epilepsy with mental retardation. Many of the protocadherins seem to be associated with the formation of specific neuronal connections in the CNS. In Drosophila there is a protocadherin-like wing polarity protein (stan, 3579aa).",

The cytoplasmic form (P5CR2, 320aa) is similar.pyruvate Important 3-carbon intermediate in many metabolic pathways, particularly of glucose metabolism and the synthesis of many amino acids. Pyruvate carboxylase catalyses the formation of 4-carbon oxaloacetate from pyruvate, CO 2 and ATP in gluconeogenesis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH, EC 1.2.1.51) uses pyruvate to produce acetylCoA. Phosphorylation of PDH by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK, EC 2.7.11.2) results in inactivation and is an important control in energy metabolism. There are multiple tissue-specific PDK isozymes. Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase deficiency can cause lactic acidosis.pyruvate carboxylase A nuclear-encoded mitochondrial enzyme (EC 6.4.1.1, a homotetramer of 1178aa subunits) enzyme that catalyses the formation of oxaloacetate from pyruvate, CO 2 and ATP in gluconeogenesis. It is an important regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and neurotransmitter synthesis.",

            "text": "puckered A Drosophila gene that encodes a phosphatase (476aa) that down-regulates the n-Jun-N terminal kinase pathway.PUFA A fatty acid with multiple unsaturated bonds (a poly-unsaturated fatty acid). Increasing the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids can alter the behaviour of cells, probably by altering physical characteristics of membranes and thus influencing the behaviour of integral membrane proteins. Whether this is true for whole organisms is less clear.puffs Expanded areas of a polytene chromosome.At these areas the chromatin becomes less condensed and the fibres unwind, though they remain continuous with the fibres in the chromosome axis. A puff usually involves unwinding at a single band, though they can include many bands as in Balbiani rings. Puffs represent sites of active RNA transcription. The pattern of puffing observed in the larvae of Drosophila, in different cells, and at different times in development provides possibly the best evidence that differentiation is controlled at the level of transcription.pulchellin A highly toxic type 2 ribosome-inactivating protein (a heterodimeric glycoprotein, an AB ptoxin) isolated from seeds of Abrus pulchellus tenuiflorus.pull-down assay A form of affinity purification in which a 'bait' protein (e.g. either GST-tagged so that it can be purified on a glutathione column or directly coupled to a matrix) is used to capture proteins (prey) with which it interacts. Often used to confirm results of yeast two-hybrid screening studies.pullulan An extracellular glucan, produced from starch by Aureobasidium pullulans, a chain of maltotriose units linked by alpha-1,4-and alpha-1,6-glucosidic bonds. Used to produce edible films.pullulanase An enzyme (EC 3.2.1.41, pullulan-6glucanohydrolase, 1090aa) that will hydrolyse (126)alpha-D-glucosidic linkages in pullulan, amylopectin and glycogen. It is an extracellular, cell surfaceanchored lipoprotein produced by Gram-negative bacteria of the genus Klebsiella. A similar enzyme is found in chloroplasts where it may be important in starch beakdown and synthesis.pulse-chase An experimental protocol used to determine cellular pathways, such as precursor-product relationships. A sample (organism, cell or cellular organelle), is exposed for a relatively brief time to a radioactively labelled molecule, the pulse. The labelled compound is then replaced with an excess of the unlabelled molecule, the chase (cold chase). The sample is then examined at various later times to determine the fate or location of radioactivity incorporated during the pulse.pulse-field electrophoresis A method used for high-resolution electrophoretic separation of very large (megabase) fragments of DNA. Electric fields 100 apart (the angle may vary) are applied to the separation gel alternately. The continuous change of direction prevents the molecules aligning in the electric field and greatly improves resolution on the axis between the two fields.Puma (1) In humans, a p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis, (193aa) one of the Bcl-2 family (see Bcl-2 homology domains. (2) In Parascaris univalens a 227 kDa spindle-and centromere-associated protein (1955aa) that be involved in the organization of the spindle apparatus and its interaction with the centromeres.(3) In rodents, PUMA-G is a G-protein coupled receptor for nicotinic acid (niacin) and (D)beta-hydroxybutyrate.pumilio In Drosophila a maternal protein that has sequence-specific RNA-binding properties and regulates translation and mRNA stability. It is required for abdominal development and to support proliferation and self-renewal of germ cells. Homologues in humans (pumilo-1, 1186aa; PUM-2, 1066aa) may be important in stem cell proliferation and self-renewal and regulate microRNA-dependent gene silencing. Pumilio-family RNA binding domains (Puf repeats or Pumilio homology domains) mediate sequence specific RNA binding and usually occur as a tandem repeat of eight domains.punctin Proteins of the extracellular matrix, deposited in a punctate manner, hence the name. They are ADAM-related glycoproteins (punctin 1, ADAMTSL1, 497aa; punctin 2, ADAMTSL3, 1690aa) with thrombospondin repeats, but without the metalloprotease and disintegrin-like domains.punctuated equilibrium A view of the evolutionary process that holds that there were long periods of stasis interrupted by relatively short periods of rapid change and speciation.Punnett's square The checkerboard (matrix) method used to determine the types of zygotes produced by fusion of gametes from parents of defined genotype.puratrophin-1 A protein (Purkinje cell atrophyassociated protein 1, pleckstrin homology domaincontaining family G member 4, 1191aa) that may be involved in intracellular signalling and cytoskeletal dynamics in the Golgi apparatus. Defects were initially thought to be the cause of spinocerebellar ataxia-31 but this has subsequently been shown to be incorrect (see bean).purine A heterocyclic compound with a fused pyrimidine/imidazole ring. Planar and aromatic in character. The parent compound for the purine bases of nucleic acids (adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine).Purkinje fibres Specialized cardiac muscle cells that conduct electrical impulses through the heart and are involved in regulating the beat.puromycin An antibiotic used as an experimental tool that acts as an aminoacyl tRNA analogue. Binds to the A-site on the ribosome, forms a peptide linkage with the growing chain and then causes premature termination.purple membrane Plasma membrane of Halobacterium and Halococcus, that contains a proteinbound carotenoid pigment that absorbs light and uses the energy to translocate protons from the cytoplasm to the exterior. The proton gradient then provides energy for ATP synthesis. The binding protein is called bacteriorhodopsin, or purple membrane protein.purpurin (1) A secretory retinol-binding protein (196aa) in developing chicken retinas.(2) A highly active photodynamic therapy sensitiser, purpurin-18.(3) An anthraquinone constituent from madder (Rubia tinctorum) root, reportedly antimutagenic. pus A viscous fluid, usually yellow-white, around a persistent infected object or as a result of local infection with bacteria that are resistant to phagocytic killing. Mostly formed from dead neutrophils. A greenish colour can be due to myeloperoxidase and blue pus is found in certain infections of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that produce the blue pigment, pyocyanin.pustules Intracellular vacuoles found in dinoflagellates arising from ducts that open at the flagellar bases. The function is unknown.putrescine A dibasic amine associated with putrifying tissue. Associates strongly with DNA. Has been suggested as a growth factor for mammalian cells in culture. Metabolic precursor of the polyamines spermine and spermidine. ",
