            "text": "The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV is a major virion structural protein. It plays an important role in cell tropism, specific binding with receptor, and cell-membrane fusion [1] [2] [3] [4] . The spike protein is of good antigenicity and could induce neutralization antibodies. Among the structural proteins, the spike protein is the only significant neutralization antigen and protective antigen. Hence, it is a suitable candidate for genetic engineering of a subunit vaccine [5] [6] [7] [8] . The development of SARS-CoV spike protein specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), especially that of neutralizing MAbs, are important in the prevention and diagnoses of SARS. Some research groups have reported MAbs of SARS-CoV [9] [10] [11] [12] . In a structural and functional study of spike protein, identification of antigenic epitopes is important. Especially, identification of neutralizing epitopes may be beneficial for designing vaccine. To date, many linear antigenic epitopes are documented. Among these linear epitopes, some are neutralizing epitopes [13] [14] [15] [16] . But on the spike protein, especially on the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, most protective neutralizing epitopes are conformational epitopes [17] . Usually it is difficult to determine the specific sequence of discontinuous conformational epitopes. However, a phage-displayed peptide library could be used to select the mimotope that could mimic the discontinuous or conformational epitopes. Here the phage-displayed peptide library was used to select the mimotope of a SARS-CoV spike protein specific neutralizing MAb 2C5. The results may provide information for further structural and functional research and for designing SARS vaccines. Phages are titered according to the kit manual as follows: First, inoculate 5-10 mL of LB with a single clone of ER2738 and incubate with shaking until a mid-log phase (OD 600~0 .5). When cells grow, melt agarose top in microwave and dispense 3 mL into sterile culture tubes, one per expected phage dilution. Equilibrate tubes at 50 \u00b0C until they are ready for use. Dilute phage in 10-fold serial dilution with LB. Once culture has reached the mid-log phase, dispense 200 \u00b5L of culture into microfuge tubes, one for each phage dilution. Add 10 \u00b5L of each dilution to each tube, vortex rapidly, and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Transfer the infected cells, one at a time, to a culture tube containing 50 \u00b0C agarose top, vortex rapidly, and immediately pour onto a 37 \u00b0C pre-warmed LB/Tet/IPTG/X-Gal plate. Allow the plate to cool for 5 min, invert, and incubate overnight at 37 \u00b0C. Examine the plates and count plaques on the plate that contains about 100 plaques. Convert phage titers to plaque forming units (pfu) per 10 \u00b5L by multiplying each number by the dilution factor.",

For further analysis of the epitope of MAb 2C5 on the spike protein, the peptide sequence was aligned with the spike protein sequence. And the alignment results showed that the peptide TPEQQFT may distribute in amino acid residues 539-559 (Fig. 2) on the spike protein of SARS-CoV.

The foreign amino acids displayed on the phage surface could be purified by affinity chromatography to antibody directed against the gene product [19] . Peptides displayed on the surface of phage could retain its native structure and bioactivity. The fusion phage could be affinity-purified and selected. Therefore, it provided a powerful method for selected target proteins and peptides. Phage-display technique could be used to assess the interaction between proteins and peptides. And this technique now considerably benefits the research in designing new vaccine, and developing diagnostic reagents, antigenic epitope mapping, cell-surface engineering, and other affinity molecular purification [20] [21] [22] .",

In this study, the MAb 2C5 was used as the selection target. The panning was carried out by incubating the Ph.D.-C7C TM Phage-Displayed Peptide Library with the microtiter plate coated with the target. After three rounds of panning, individual clones are characterized by DNA sequencing and phage ELISA. Among 20 clones, nearly 10 displayed peptide TPEQQFT. By aligning with the spike protein of SARS-CoV, the peptide TPEQQFT may distribute in amino-acid residues 539 to 559. But the fusion protein containing spike-protein fragment of amino-acid residues 539 to 559 could be recognized by MAb 2C5. However, this fragment contains a linear epitope because this fusion protein could be recognized by SARS-CoV-immunized animal sera [14] . The phagedisplayed peptide TRPQQFT could inhibit the binding between MAb 2C5 and the spike protein. So this peptide is the mimotope of MAb 2C5.",
