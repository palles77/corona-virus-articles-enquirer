AOM usually occurs in conjunction with a viral upper respiratory infection (URI) and in the vast majority of cases can be clearly regarded as a complication of a viral URI. Koivunen et al. [3] recently corroborated earlier findings about the temporal development of AOM in the course of URI. Of 250 episodes of AOM in children, the incidence was highest during days 2 through 5 after the onset of respiratory symptoms. The distinctive role of URI in the development of AOM was also demonstrated by Daly et al. [4] , who followed 596 infants from birth to age 6 months. Respiratory tract infection was the most important predictor for early AOM, indisputably outweighing other risk factors (eg, daycare attendance). The strongest evidence for the decisive role of viruses in the etiopathogenesis of AOM is, however, provided by direct intervention trials investigating the efficacy of viral vaccination in the prevention of AOM. Studies with influenza vaccine have demonstrated that prevention of the preceding viral URI is an effective way to prevent the development of AOM as a complication [5,6,7\u2022\u2022] .",

In previous studies, detection of respiratory viruses has been based on virus culture and/or viral antigen detection methods, and it is obvious that limitations in these techniques have resulted in underdetection of viruses in the specimens. The recent development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays for several respiratory viruses may substantially increase the rates of viral detection in nasopharyngeal specimens [8\u2022,9] . Pitk\u00e4ranta et al. [10\u2022] studied 92 children with AOM using PCR for detection of rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and coronavirus and found at least one of these viruses in the nasopharyngeal aspirates from 62% of the children. In a recent study from the University of Turku, Finland, we searched for viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates with rapid antigen detection for RSV, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus and with PCR for rhinovirus, enterovirus, and coronavirus. By these methods, viral infection could be documented in 90% of 67 children with AOM (A. Ruohola et al., Unpublished data).",

Numerous studies in both animals and humans have provided strong evidence of a causal role for respiratory viruses in the disruption of normal eustachian tube function [2] . One plausible mechanism by which viruses may cause eustachian tube dysfunction is that viruses are known to induce the release of cytokines and other inflam-Despite the extensive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, poor clinical response to the treatment of acute otitis media is common. Evidence derived from numerous studies during the past two decades supports a crucial role for respiratory viruses in the etiology and pathogenesis of acute otitis media, and recent studies indicate that viruses may also have a profound adverse effect on the resolution of this disease. Viruses seem to interact with bacteria and enhance the local inflammatory process in the middle ear. Effective adjuvant therapies are needed to improve outcome in children with otitis media. Increasing knowledge of the role of viruses, viral-bacterial interaction, and host inflammatory mechanisms in otitis media may lead to major improvements in the management of this disease. matory mediators from target cells in the nasopharynx [11, 12] . After intranasal challenge, many of these mediators have been shown to provoke eustachian tube dysfunction [13] . In a recent study of adult volunteers, Fritz et al. [14] reported that nasal lavage fluid levels of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, and IL-10 increased in response to influenza virus infection, and the levels correlated significantly with the magnitude and time course of the symptoms. The host-response mechanisms triggered by a viral infection are, however, extremely complex, involving a network of factors that affect each other in a time-dependent manner. Patel et al. [15\u2022] showed that the production of IL-8 by respiratory epithelial cells during an RSV infection was primarily regulated by IL-1\u03b1. Further, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 induced the synthesis of IL-8 at 24 hours but partially inhibited the synthesis of this cytokine at 48 hours. Another study by the same group demonstrated the existence of a similar autocrine regulation of IL-6 production during RSV infection [16] . Despite the rapidly increasing knowledge of the host inflammatory response during a viral URI, it is likely that many essential factors contributing to the inflammatory processes in the nasopharynx remain to be identified.",

            "text": "During recent years, the use of PCR has dramatically increased the rates of virus detection in the MEF. Okamoto et al. [31] found RSV genomic sequences in 53% of 44 MEF samples from children with AOM. Pitk\u00e4ranta et al. [10\u2022] used PCR for rhinovirus, RSV, and coronavirus and recovered RNA from at least one of these viruses in the MEF of 48% of 92 children with AOM. In a study by Cone et al. [32] , DNA from human herpesvirus 6 was detected in 71% of MEFs from 49 children with AOM. These high rates of viral detection have inevitably raised the question of the real significance of these findings. Because of the very high sensitivity of the PCR technique, the question has arisen The specific viral cause of the URI could be determined in 41% of the cases. In children with AOM during a documented RSV infection, the same virus could be detected in the MEF in 74% of cases. The relative prevalence of RSV in the MEF was significantly higher than that of parainfluenza (52%) or influenza viruses (42%), which in turn were found significantly more often in the MEF than were enteroviruses (11%) or adenoviruses (4%). This study has two major implications. First, the results indicate that RSV has a particularly strong ability to invade the middle ear. Second, the different relative prevalences of the viruses in the MEF suggest that while some viruses may indeed enter the middle ear passively along with nasal secretions, others actively invade the middle ear and may contribute to the inflammatory process in the middle-ear mucosa. If all viruses found in the MEF were only \"innocent bystanders\" without any active role, they should be detected in the MEF at roughly equal rates during different viral infections. In this study, the relative importance of rhinoviruses could not be determined because the incidence of rhinovirus infections was too low for a meaningful analysis [33\u2022\u2022] . However, a study by Pitk\u00e4ranta et al. [10\u2022] , who used PCR to detect viruses in the MEF, suggested that the prevalence of rhinoviruses in the MEF may be similar to that of RSV.",

Overall, mixed viral-bacterial infections represent approximately 15% of all cases of AOM. Current estimates of either sole viral or mixed viral-bacterial AOM may not, however, represent the true occurrence of viruses in the middle ear because it is obvious that underdetection of viruses is still common. Further, it has also been suggested that the bacteriologic techniques routinely used are not sensitive enough for full detection of bacteria in the MEF [34] . Therefore, it is possible that with the increasing availability of the more sensitive techniques for detection of both viruses and bacteria, our current concept of the relative distribution of viral and/or bacterial causes of AOM will be transformed in the near future [8\u2022,9,34,35] .",

This often results in a change in the antibiotic or even the use of several courses of different antibiotics for the same episode because physicians assume that the cause of the failure is bacterial resistance to the antibiotic used. It has been shown, however, that resistant bacteria account for only a small proportion (about 20%) of these cases [36] . During the past decade, much attention has been focused on the potential role of viruses in treatment failure. Although viruses are often found in the MEF, the importance of this finding has been questioned because viral replication in the human middle-ear epithelium during AOM has not been demonstrated. Nevertheless, the results of clinical studies from Texas and Finland strongly suggest that viruses play a significant role in the outcome of otitis media.",

The effect of viruses on the outcome of otitis media was further supported by a subsequent larger study of 271 children [29] . In this study, otitis media persisted in a significantly higher proportion of children with combined viral and bacterial infection than in those with bacteria alone in the MEF. Arola et al. [27] studied 22 children with AOM who had failed to improve after 2 days of antibiotic therapy. Bacteria were found in the MEF in only four of these children, and only one isolate was resistant to the antibiotic used. Viruses were detected in the MEF of 32% of these children compared with 15% of children in a comparison group with newly diagnosed, untreated AOM. Whether different viruses have a varying impact on the clinical outcome of otitis media is not known, but Sung et al.

Numerous inflammatory mediators (eg, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF, histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglan-dins) have been detected in the MEF of patients with otitis media [41] [42] [43] . In a study of 248 children with AOM [44] , histamine concentrations in the MEF were higher in those with evidence of concurrent viral infection than in those without and bacteria and viruses appeared to have an additive effect on the histamine content in the MEF. Further, 3 to 5 days of antibiotic treatment did not decrease the histamine concentrations, and the pretreatment levels tended to be higher in children with persistent otitis media than in those who had a good response to treatment. In another study [30] , the concentrations of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and IL-8 were measured in 271 MEF samples from 106 children. The highest concentrations of these mediators were found in MEFs containing both bacteria and virus. In five children who had bilateral AOM and similar bacterial findings in both ears, LTB4 and IL-8 levels were higher in the ear that contained virus than in the contralateral ear. High concentrations of LTB4 at the time of AOM diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic treatment were associated with an increased rate of treatment failure. Antibiotic treatment had no effect on the levels of these mediators. Similarly, in a study of two chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (which are considered histamine-releasing factors), higher concentrations of these substances were found in MEF samples containing both bacteria and virus than in samples with bacteria alone [45] .",
