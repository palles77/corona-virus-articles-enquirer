At this exposed position, they serve as receptors for sialic acid-recognising proteins and are consequently involved in wide variety of biological events, both pathogenic and non-pathogenic [1e3]. One of the most common modifications of sialic acids in mammals is O-acetylation. It occurs either at C-4 or at any position within the glycerol side chain of sialic acid and multiple acetylations are possible ( Fig. 1) [4, 5] .",

            "text": "Sialate-O-acetylation has attracted increased interest in recent years due its abundance and involvement in many, including pathological, biological processes. For instance, acetylation may promote or hinder recognition of sialic acid by proteins, cells or pathogens. O-acetylation may also slow down the activity of degradative enzymes such as sialate lyases or sialidases [3] . Related biological events include cell differentiation, tumor growth, immunity, apoptosis, microbial infections and in particular cancer where they are considered markers for certain skin tumors and a form of leukaemia [2e7] . Another important function of O-acetylation is masking of siglec binding sites. CD22, a siglec regulating the activity of the B-cell receptor, binds to a2-6 linked sialic acids, and binding can be masked by 9-O-acetylation [8] . This masking is regulated by the cellular sialate-O-acetylesterase, which thereby also regulates B-cell receptor signal strength [9] . Loss of function of the esterase activity results in autoimmune disease [10, 11] .",

Several RNA viruses which infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract utilize sialic acids as a receptor determinant. To facilitate release of progeny virus from infected cells, a number of viruses express \"receptor-destroying enzymes\" (RDE), which are targets for antiviral drugs. The best known are the sialidase-inhibitors Zanamivir (Relenza) and Oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Besides sialidases, the haemagglutinin-esterases (HE) of influenza C virus, isavirus, betacoronaviruses and toroviruses represent another class of RDEs. They are sialate-O-acetylesterases (SOAE) hydrolysing O-acetyl esters of O-acetylated sialic acid derivatives (Fig. 1) . Two main subtypes of HEs are known: sialate-4-O-acetylesterases (4-SOAE) and sialate-9-O-acetylesterases (9-SOAE).",

HCoVs account for 10e30% of respiratory infections, in particular, the common cold, but they can also cause gastroenteritis and neurological disorders [12, 13] . The infections are usually mild and subclinical, but strains related to OC43 and HKU1 were associated with severe human disease [14, 15] . Betacoronaviruses have attracted attention after the outbreak of SARS CoV in 2002/2003. This genus consists of human and animal viruses. Coronaviruses are able to cross the animal-to-human species barrier: bat-to-human in case of SARS CoV [16, 17] and bovine-to-human in case of BCoV leading to HCoV OC43 [18] . Toroviruses (ToV) are evolutionary related to coronaviruses [19] . ToV are associated with asymptomatic enteric infections in pigs [20] . Studies suggest that they are highly prevalent in swine populations [21, 22] . The closely related bovine toroviruses (BToV) are implicated with serious or even fatal infections [23e25]; they are found worldwide [26e30] . ToV are also associated with human gastroenteritis. In fecal samples from children and adults with diarrhoea, torovirus antigens were detected by ELISA [31, 32] , immunoelectron microscopy [33e35] and by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with primers covering a highly conserved region of the ToV genomes [35] .",

Dry DCM (20 mL) was added via syringe and the resulting suspension formed was ultrasonicated for a few minutes then cooled to approximately 0 C. Diphosgene (152 mL, 1.23 mmol) was added via microsyringe to the white suspension with vigourous stirring. When TLC indicated completion of the reaction, the reaction was quenched by pouring the solution into 40 mL of cold 10% KH 2 PO 4 . The DCM layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (4 \u00c2 25 mL). The organic phases were then dried over MgSO 4 and the solvents were evaporated. After flash chromatography (EA:MeOH; 15:1), compound 8 was obtained as a clear oil (220 mg, 60%). R f : 0.63 (EA:MeOH; 5:1",

Silicabased MPLC chromatography was carried out on the B\u00fcchi Sepacore system equipped with glass columns packed with LiChroprep Si 60 (15e25 mm) from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany. Solvents for chromatography were used as received except for toluene and ethyl acetate, which were distilled before use. Gel permeation chromatography was carried out in the 1e10 mg scale on an XK 16/70 column (bed volume 130 mL), from Amersham packed with Sephadex G-10 (particle size 40e120 mm) and 0.1M NH 4 HCO 3 as buffer. Detection was achieved with a differential refractometer from Knauer, Berlin, Germany.H NMR, 13 C NMR, 31 P NMR and all multidimensional spectra were recorded on Varian VNMRS spectrometers (600 MHz, 500 MHz or 400 MHz). Chemical shifts in 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were referenced to the residual proton resonance of the respective deuterated solvents, CDCl 3 (7.26 ppm), D 2 O (4.80 ppm) and CD 3 OD (3.31 ppm) respectively. For 31 P NMR spectra H 3 PO 4 was used as external standard (0 ppm).HR-ESI-MS spectra were recorded on a Bruker Daltonics Apex III in positive mode with MeOH and/or H 2 O as solvent. Where possible, HR-ESI-MS has been used to characterise compounds which have been synthesised.Abbreviations: EA: ethyl acetate; DCM: dichloromethane; Tol: toluene. THF: tetrahydrofuran.6.2.
