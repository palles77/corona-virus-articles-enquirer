Methods: As several years have now passed, it is possible to interrogate national statistics that have become available since the outbreak to provide a more accurate estimate of the actual macro-economic impact of SARS. National statistics were examined for anomalies that corresponded to the timing of the SARS outbreak and, where possible, the size of any gain or loss found estimated. Results: Estimates and models produced at the time of the outbreak suggested that SARS could have a catastrophic effect on the global economy. Our analysis suggests that the scale of the SARS impact on affected economies was far smaller than suggested by contemporary media reports and model estimates.",

We suggest that further work is needed to develop a more comprehensive macro-economic model able to more accurately estimate the relative cost and effect of a global response to outbreaks of international concern. The implications of our findings are discussed in the light of a prospective influenza pandemic. and the USA. This lead to serious public health concerns. The SARS outbreak peaked during the second quarter of 2003 and was declared over by July 2003. Although approximately 10,000 individuals were infected, of which 10% died, the overall impact on health was far less devastating than initially feared. The SARS outbreak was also perhaps the first instance of a concurrent global concern for the 0168-8510/$ -see front matter",

For instance the avoidance of public places by natives together with the avoidance of a certain country by tourists will mainly impact the retail, tourism and entertainment related sectors.

Often an effect of magnitude less than one percent is not distinguishable from the rest of the series and unless an anomaly in the data can be clearly viewed in the plot of the series, we have classified the impact as \"no evidence of a loss\". Here, we present some examples of cases where a notable effect was found and then summarise our findings. ues for 2002 and 2001 estimates the loss for the first quarter. Calculating the loss for the second quarter in the same way and summing these losses yields a loss estimate of HK$ 29081.5 million or US$ 3.7 billion. However, it should be noted that before the end of the year, GDP had returned to pre-SARS levels and 2004 shows slight growth over previous years. Table 3 shows the loss to China GDP growth in the second quarter of 2003. Averaging the first, third and fourth quarter, the second quarter loss is estimated as 3.1% for the quarter. 2004 the loss estimate is RM 6425.15 million = US$ 1.7 billion. 3.3.3.1. Hong Kong restaurants. Fig. 4 shows the Hong Kong restaurant sector. This plot clearly indicates a sharp decline in restaurant receipts in the second quarter of 2003; also the first quarter figure is slightly lower than previous quarters possibly indicating the start of the decline which then declined further in March. The third quarter figure is also slightly low possibly indicating the end of the decline. It is reasonable to attribute the sharp decline, which is of the order of HK$ 2000 million = US$ 0.26 billion, to the SARS outbreak as the most obvious major potential effect on Hong Kong's economy for such a short period. Fig. 5 shows a significant decline in the Canadian accommodation and food services sector from March 2003 to September 2003. This decline can be reasonably attributed to SARS since it corresponds to the appropriate timescale of the outbreak. It also suggests that this sector of Canada's economy did not recover immediately following the end of the disease scare. By averaging the figures for January, February, October, November and December 2003 and assuming that, aside from SARS, the data below would have continued along the same average value as the mean of those unaffected months, the estimated effect of SARS on the Canadian accommodation and food services sector is $ 5272 million or US$ 4.3 billion. Fig. 6 shows Australian losses for accommodation and food due to SARS. The estimated loss in 2003-2004 is $ 178 million = US$ 0.12 billion assuming linear growth from previous years. Fig. 7 shows a loss in the second quarter of 2003 to gazetted hotels in Singapore. If the second quarter data is assumed to be approximately similar to the first, third and fourth quarter, the estimated loss is approximately $0.2 billion (Singapore) or US$ 0.12 billion.",

It is also possible that, since the WHO took an active role in the SARS outbreak using its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), the intervention by WHO and the input from this globalised network may have contributed to a reduction in the progression of the disease. However, for those countries, such as China and Hong Kong, where SARS became a real threat with a significant death toll, there were indeed some large short-term losses. However, these losses correspond only to the relatively short period of the disease outbreak, after which consumer confidence returned and many stocks that had diminished were replenished and some purchases which were forgone at the height of the outbreak were made after the perceived risk was reduced. This conjecture is supported by the rapid return to normality (bounce-back) exhibited in many cases. Indeed, some of the predictive economic models [4] considered two scenarios of SARS lasting one quarter or two quarters, which may explain the over-estimation of effect in some cases. In reality, for many coun-tries the time from first to last probable case was barely one month. These assumptions were reasonable at the time of the outbreak but the true impact did not reach the heights of some model predictions.",

For instance, the very obvious economic repercussions from the outbreak provide a frame of reference for the value of investment in policies and interventions designed to address the emergence and transmission of an outbreak. This could be then used to indicate the value to be placed on transparency by governments and early notification of an outbreak which may be used as a case for increased investment in surveillance or cross-national compensatory transfers of funds to support those countries with an outbreak in the notification of it. In addition, this work demonstrates that the economic impact is determined largely by the desire of people to reduce their public interaction (travel, leisure, tourism), which indicates the importance of portraying a correct understanding of the risk posed by the outbreak to the population. In this respect, it is interesting to reflect upon the possible role of the media in exacerbating or dampening the impact of SARS upon economic activity. It has been concluded elsewhere that \"the general consensus is that the media coverage of SARS was excessive, sometimes inaccurate, and sensationalist\" [3, p. 3117 ]. However, the role of the media in the communication of risk, and how this is interpreted and acted upon, remains an area for debate, and certainly attempting to quantify the impact of media portrayal of the outbreak in economic terms is beyond this paper and has not been undertaken elsewhere. Of more general importance for the impact of future outbreaks, and the policy response to them, might be the impact that exaggerated media reporting of a number of such outbreaks may generate either a more general climate of 'fear', and thus exacerbating the response to each individual outbreak, or desensitizing the public to the effects of such outbreaks, if the reality consistently falls short of the rhetoric [3] . Clearly the role of media, and more general communication, concerning outbreaks requires further research.",

Border screening is also an unnecessary cost since it only detects those who are at certain stage of disease progression from entering a country [12] .
