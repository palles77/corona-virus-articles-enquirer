It has been reported that Group I NPVs such as Autographa californica multiple NPV (AcMNPV) can transduce mammalian cells, while Group II NPVs such as Helicoverpa armigera single NPV (HaSNPV) cannot. Here we report that AcMNPV was capable of stimulating antiviral activity in human hepatoma cells (SMMC-7721) manifested by inhibition of Vesicular Stomatitis virus (VSV) replication. In contrast, the HaSNPV and the Spodoptera exigua multiple NPV (SeMNPV) of group \u0406\u0406 had no inhibitory effect on VSV. Recombinant AcMNPV was shown to induce interferons alpha/beta even in the absence of transgene expression in human SMMC-7721 cells, while it mediated transgene expression in BHK and L929 mammalian cells without an ensuing antiviral activity.",

            "text": "Baculoviridae are pathogenic to arthropods, primarily certain insect species but they do not replicate productively in vertebrates. The baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) has long been used as a bio-pesticide and as an efficient vector for the expression of exogenous proteins in insect cells [12] . Recently, several laboratories, including ours, have reported that AcMNPV containing an appropriate eukaryotic promoter can efficiently transfer and express foreign genes in several mammalian cells [10, 13, 14, 17] and in animal models [5, 6, 26] . This vector was also shown to be capable of carrying large inserts and efficiently infecting a variety of cell lines without any apparent productive viral replication or cytopathic effect, even at high multiplicities of infection (MOI) [9, 11] . Viral infection of mammalian cells results in the production of various cytokines, including members of the interferon (IFN) family [18] . Many RNA and DNA viruses produce dsRNA and induce the synthesis of alpha/beta IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) in various cell types [18] . It has been reported that interactions of viral proteins with the host cell membrane may be sufficient to stimulate IFN production without productive virus replication [19] [20] [21] . It has been recently demonstrated that AcMNPV can stimulate cytokine production in mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo [8, 15] . Gronowski et al. [8] reported that monoclonal antibodies specific for GP64, which is the major glycoprotein of AcMNPV budded virus phenotype, neutralized baculovirus-dependent IFN production. Therefore, the envelope protein GP64 of AcMNPV may be the essential stimulus to induce IFN production in mammalian cells.",
