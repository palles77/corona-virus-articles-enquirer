Our findings corroborate with findings from other local and international studies. [4] [5] [6] [7] In addition, our study found that the perception of global threat of emerging infectious diseases also positively influenced nurses' intention for future influenza vaccination. This could explain the behaviors of Hong Kong nurses whose influenza vaccination uptake declined after the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003 until the avian influenza outbreak in neighboring China in 2005 and the influenza pandemic in 2009. 3 On the other hand, nurses who perceived themselves to be nonsusceptible to influenza and who preferred alternatives to vaccination were less likely to intend to be vaccinated in the future. This is of concern, because HCWs often perceived themselves to be healthy and not at risk of influenza infection. 4, 8 Furthermore, Singapore is a multiracial country where the use of complementary and alternative medicine is prevalent. 9 These beliefs, which could greatly reduce the uptake of vaccination, would need to be addressed. Despite the demonstration of vaccine safety, HCWs continue to be concerned about the adverse effects. 2, 3, 5, 8 Our study found that nurses who feared the adverse effects of influenza vaccination were less likely to intend to receive future vaccination. More targeted interventions would have to be implemented to address these fears.",
