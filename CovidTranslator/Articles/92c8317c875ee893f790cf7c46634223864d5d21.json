            "text": "A safe and effective vaccine for feline leukemia has been a primary goal of researchers studying feline leukemia virus (FeLV) since the early 1970s. This emphasis was generated following the identification of feline leukemia as a virally induced disease (Jarrett et al., 1964) and with the isolation of viral strains by Kawakami et al. (1967) and Rickard et al. (1969) in the late 1960s. A need existed for an FeLV vaccine since the virus, with its attendant associated syndromes, represents a leading cause of cat mortality worldwide. In January 1985, a commercial vaccine (\"Leukocell\", Norden Laboratories, Lincoln, NE) was licensed for use in the U.S.A. using as its basis a prototype vaccine developed at the Ohio State University (Lewis et al., 1981) . The prototype contained FeLV antigens released from lymphoid cells persistently infected with the Kawakami isolate of FeLV. These FeLV-associated proteins were found to be non-infectious and capable of producing an immune response without the immunosuppressive pathology characteristic of live attenuated (Salerno et al., 1979) and killed FeLV .",

(1981) showing that cats respond immunologically to p 15E when they are vaccinated. Studies have been performed to determine if the presence of pl5E has any detrimental effects upon the immune system of the host. However, 2 avenues of inquiry have reliably shown that the vaccine produces no immunosuppressive effect upon lymphocyte function. First, vaccination does not impair lymphocyte blastogenesis. Second, when \"Leukocell\" was given concurrently with other feline vaccines, cats responded immunologically to all the immunizing agents administered. This indicates that, although pl5E is present, it must be in an alternate or precursor form that does not induce the immunosuppressive pathology associated with it in its processed form.",

            "text": "Studies were conducted to determine if \"Leukocelr' had similar effects on lymophocyte blastogenes and showed that the vaccine has no effect on lymphocyte mitogenesis. In one study, 1:2 or 1:20 dilutions of the unadjuvanted, soluble vaccine proteins were combined in vitro with concanavalin A-stimulated lymphocytes. These vaccine proteins had no significant effect on simulated growth of cat lymphocytes when compared with control samples {Table 1 ). Similar tests using whole virus or pl5E cause a profound suppression of Tcell mitogenesis {Hebebrand et al., 1977; . In a second test, cats were vaccinated twice with a 10-fold concentration of adjuvanted vaccine. As shown in Table 2 , lymphocytes from these cats showed no change in LBT (lymphocyte blast transformation) response when comparing pre-and postvaccination values, nor did their LBT values differ appreciably from those in non-vaccinated cats. These studies suggest that although pl5E antigenic sites exist within the \"Leukocell\" preparation, the protein is not in an active suppressive form. Previous studies have found a level of pl5E as low as 5 #g ml-1 (Mathes et al., 1978) to be suppressive, so that if the protein is present at all, it is at levels of < 5 #g ml-1. Additional information can be seen in studies showing that \"Leukocell\", given concurrently with modified live virus (MLV) or inactivated rabies vaccine or with a combination MLV feline panleukopenia-feline calicivirus-feline rhinotracheitis vaccine, caused no loss of amnestic response to any of the immunizing agents . For example, cats with an immune history to FeLV and rabies virus were inoculated concurrently with \"Leukocell\" and MLV rabies vaccine. Within 3 weeks, test cats developed a 10-fold increase in their mean gp70 antibody level and a 25-fold increase in their mean FOCMA (feline oncornavirus membrane antigen) antibody titer. A similar pattern of serologic response occurred following concurrent administration of \"Leukocelr' and other routinely used feline vaccines. We have previously shown that pl5E interferes with both antiviral and anti-tumor responses and that such immunosuppression occurs rapidly when pl5E is introduced to the host (Mathes et al., 1979) . Therefore, a post-vaccination sero- logic response to FeLV and heterologous vaccines is a significant indicator of the absence of immune interference following administration of \"Leukocell\". In a recent study by Henderson et al. (1984) , new light was shed on how the p15E protein may acquire its immunosuppressive properties. Retrovirus envelope protein (in precursor form) is processed before virion assembly and maturation. One of the structural changes that occurs is cleavage by cellular enzymes of a 2000-dalton peptide from the precursor molecule. This takes place after the viral protein is produced, while it is being transported to the outer cellular membrane. Thus, prior to virus assembly, p15E undergoes proteolytic processing. This event may prove to be necessary for pl5E to become immunosuppressive. The pl5E moiety present within the vaccine may be in an unprocessed form, thus allowing antibody development without immunosuppressive effects. Mastro et al. (1986) have shown that vaccinated cats respond to different viral antigens in the vaccine preparation than those found with whole virus. They saw that the envelope gp70 of FeLV is associated with protection, but the gp70 present on the virion is not responded to strongly until after challenge. This suggests that the gp70 moiety in the vaccine is similar, but different to that found on mature virions. The vaccine may induce a primary immunization for gp70 and the challenge then produces a strong amnestic response. A similar mechanism may occur with p15E, with an altered or immature form present in the vaccine which can induce antibody against virion pl5E.",

However, the FeLV genome is present in target cells and is capable of viral reactivation under certain conditions, most notably administration of corticosteroids (Rojko et al., 1982) . In addition, recent reports by Lewis et al. (1986) and Lafrado and Olsen (1986) indicate that a neutrophil defect occurs rapidly upon FeLV infection and that this defect persists even in a latent host. This defect is observed in neutrophils isolated from FeLV-negative cats previously exposed to FeLV (Table 3) . The neutrophils lose their ability to form oxygen-free radicals, thus losing their ability to kill invading organisms. Latency thus became an intriguing test of \"Leukocell\" efficacy. If the vaccine could reliably protect cats from latent infection, its value as a prophylactic agent would be enhanced considerably.",

            "text": "In tests conducted at Norden Laboratories, 17 cats that were vaccinated and challenged were evaluated for viral latency 2-3 years after virus challenge. Test cats had received the recommended 3 vaccine doses and were challenged with the Rickard strain of FeLV (FeLV-R) using procedures previously described . Annual booster vaccinations with a single dose were also administered. In an attempt to activate latent FeLV 24-36 months after challenge, methylprednisolone was administered to all test cats once a week for 4 consecutive weeks at the rate of 7.5 mg kg-1. This immunosuppressive treatment induced a mean 60% reduction in lymphocyte count, indicating that immunocompetence of the test cat was, in fact, compromised (15 of the 17 cats experienced a reduction in lymphocyte count). Latency was assessed by culturing bone marrow aspirates obtained from femoral shafts prior to and 1 week after the last of the 4 immunosuppressive treatments. Cultures were maintained for 21 days. Culture media contained hydrocortisone phosphate which has been shown to considerably enhance FeLV reactivation (Rojko et al., 1982 ) . The presence of the FeLV group-specific protein in culture fluids was determined by ELISA methods and co-cultivation plaque assays. The 15 test cats had a diverse viremic status after challenge, creating a varied group for evaluating virus reactivation. Four cats were aviremic and 11 were transiently viremic. Latent post-challenge infections were not observed in the 15 potentially latent cats (Table 4) , even when repeated immunosuppressive treatment was administered. This result takes on added significance in view of: (1) the large viral challenge burden (5 \u00d7 106 infectious units), which increases the likelihood of latent infection; (2) the use of FeLV-R as a challenge agent, a strain which has a predisposition towards viral latency (Pedersen et al., 1984) ; (3) enhancement of culture media with hydrocortisone acetate in order to promote viral reactivation; (4) demonstrated immunosuppression of test cats; (5) transient FeLV infection in 11 of 15 cats after challenge, indicating that genome integration occurred, but was subsequently eliminated as a result of the host immune response.

An alternate site of injection was suggested as a solution to this problem. The commercial preparation was tested for its effectiveness when given via a SC route in 2-and 3-dose regimens. The serologic responses generated were compared with that for IM vaccinates. The geometric mean anti-gp70 and anti-FOCMA values were considerably greater following SC vaccination than after IM vaccination. Only 2 SC doses were needed to produce strong gp70 and FOCMA antibody values equal to those observed following the 3-dose IM regimen. Thus, the SC route elicited an antibody response that was both stronger and more rapid than the IM response. It appears that route of administration, indeed, affects the immune response to antigens and that a 2-dose regimen may be sufficient for efficacy, although the manufacturers still suggest 3 doses for maximal effect. This experience suggests that investigating alternate routes of administration should probably be an obligatory part of vaccine development for other vaccines, especially for adjuvanted preparations.",

The experience of this colony is significant in that it involved a large number of vaccinates over an extended period with a significant number having been exposed to FeLV-infected cats; secondly, it demonstrated that a program of diagnostic screening and vaccination can effectively eliminate feline leukemia, even in a facility with a history of the disease and a transient population involving high risk of exposure. values alone, and the development of a strong cytotoxic response should also be considered as a potentially protective response.",

            "text": "The ultimate test of vaccine efficacy is protection against virulent challenge that affects non-vaccinated controls. In challenge-of-immunity studies, the licensed vaccine protected 80% of cats from persistent viremia and 92% from tumor development for > 2 years after challenge, even though vaccinates were artificially immunosuppressed with corticosteroids (Lewis et al., 1981; Sharpee et al., 1986) . This qualification is an important one that is often overlooked when pointing out simply that \"Leukocell\" has 80% efficacy. The vaccine has 80% efficacy in artificially immunosuppressed cats subjected to a massive challenge dose with a highly virulent agent on 2 successive days (Lewis et al., 1981 ) . This challenge regime was able to infect 100% of the control population regardless of their ages. We believe that 80% efficacy under these circumstances would be equal to 100% efficacy under typical field conditions.Although serologic response to vaccination is secondary to protection, vaccinated cats in these studies exhibited antibody responses to whole FeLV, FOCMA or gp70. The licensed vaccine elicited mean post-vaccination anti-FeLV and anti-FOCMA values in cats that exceeded mean post-challenge titers of non-vaccinated controls and the prototype vaccine elicited a gp70 antibody response in all test cats (Lewis et al., 1981) , although significant virus neutralizing antibody was not detected prior to challenge. A later study by independent investigators showed mean FOCMA and gp70 antibody values in 70 seronegative cats exceeded protective levels (Stallman and Legendre, 1986) . However, with a seroconversion rate in this study of 64% to either FOCMA or gp70, leaves open to question the importance of these conventional measures of FeLV immunity.A strong and consistent serologic response is desirable, but certainly not the sole or possibly even the most critical indicator of protection, particularly protection resulting from cellular immunity. Although antibody production is stimulated by the vaccine and is easily measured, it is not the only immune response generated. Therefore, is a vaccinated cat that does not express virusneutralizing antibody resistant to disease? Previous studies indicate that the answer is \"yes\", as was shown by Lewis et al. (1981) . A protective response was generated, even without significant virus-neutralizing antibody. In all probability, the marked amnestic response that was observed in all the vaccinated cats following challenge (Lewis et al., 1981; Sharpee et al., 1986 ) allowed for a protective response. Initial serologic response in some animals was modest, but challenge was followed by a much more pronounced antibody response and protection.In addition to the development of a conventional serologic antibody response, a strong cytotoxic response is also needed. Studies have shown that feline complement-dependent cytotoxic (CDC) antibodies in the presence of cat complement will lyse homologous FeLV-infected tumor cells (Grant et al., 1977) . This may be particularly important in the case of FeLV since, unlike 306 herpes-or coronavirus, FeLV is a non-lytic virus. Thus, an infected cell will produce virus for an extended period. Lysis will interrupt cell transformation and viral replication. Virus-neutralizing antibody will neutralize cell-free FeLV, but has no effect on FeLV transformation of cells or viral replication within those cells. Removal of FeLV-infected and/or transformed cells is essential for total protection from future development of FeLV-associated disease. The development of CDV antibody is one way for this to occur.In a limited number of cats tested at Norden Laboratories, \"Leukocell\" consistently elicited marked levels of CD\u00a5 antibodies, as shown in Fig. 1 . Four specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats exhibited a CDC antibody response after each of 3 vaccine doses. Interestingly, CDV antibody responses were significant in all cats following 2 doses (well above the 5.0 index considered positive), while gp70 values at the same test interval were still modest and below the 0.2 optical density value considered positive. Thus, the vaccine's immunizing properties should not be assessed on the basis of anti-gp70 or anti-FOCMA ",
