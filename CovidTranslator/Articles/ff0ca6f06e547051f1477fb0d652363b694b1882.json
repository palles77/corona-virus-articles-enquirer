To build the perceived disease process from 144 this model, we then incorporate rates of testing for each fraction of the population, and 145 the sensitivity and specificity of the test as follows. 146 147 Importantly, we will define as susceptible any person one who is not infected with our the 148 pathogen of concern, despite possible infection with another illness. It is therefore not 149 only reasonable but probable that \"susceptible people\" will seek out health care services 150 and be tested for infection under our surveillance process, especially if the symptoms of 151 their infection closely match those of the pathogen causing our focal outbreak. We 152 therefore define \u03b1 to be the rate at which susceptible people are tested for illness, call \u03b4 153 the rate at which infected people are tested for illness, and call \u03bb the rate at which 154 recovered people are tested for illness. (For purposes of this paper, we will assume 155 \u03bb \u03b1 = , however this assumption may be relaxed in future work if memory of recently 156 resolved symptoms affects health care seeking behavior). We define the false positive 157 rate of the diagnostic test 1 \u03b5 and the false negative rate of the test 2 \u03b5 (these may apply 158 either to clinical diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, or else to error rates stemming 159 from differences in physician opinion during syndromic surveillance). 160 161 .

While this might at first seem straightforward, there arises the complication that 172 our health care seeking behavior functions are likely to be problematic in at least three 173 separate ways: (1) they are likely to be functions of the current perceived prevalence of 174 infection in the population (i.e. some function of m i ), (2) they are likely to be functions of 175 time since the beginning of the perception of the current outbreak, (3) they are likely to 176 be non-linear and, in some cases, not even continuous.

We, therefore, 188 begin with an initially reconstructed SIR system (denoted by *) using only our measured 189 identical, we see that asymmetry in error type rates alone can drastically alter our 220 understanding of an ongoing outbreak (Fig. 1a) . Extending this simple case to also 221 include behavioral responses that shift over the course of an outbreak (i.e. non-constant 222 testing rates), while still keeping all else the same, we see also that there can be drastic 223 errors, even in the understood shape of the incidence curve to match the cases observed 224 (Fig. 1b) .

They allow us to predict the time course of spread within a 53 population(Chowell et al. 2017; Perkins et al. 2016; van den Driessche and Watmough 54 2002) , provide critical cost-benefit estimates (Dasbach et al. 2006; Hayman et al. 2017; 55 Keeling et al. 2017; Purdy et al. 2004), and evaluate best practices for particular 56 interventions (Andrews and Basu 2011; Andrews and Bauch 2016; Ferguson et al. 2003; 57 Kretzschmar et al. 2004).
