Derived from the bone marrow, NK cells circulate in the blood and become activated by cytokines or upon encountering target cells that express ligands for NK cell receptors [2] . NK cell receptors are encoded in the germline and do not undergo somatic recombination like Band T-cell antigen receptors; it is the balance of signals from activating and inhibitory receptors that determines the outcome of NK cell activity. Some inhibitory receptors recognize MHC class I, which is present on virtually all healthy cells, and prevent NK cell attack against these cells. Loss of MHC class I from cells owing to infection or transformation can lead to NK cell activation, as proposed by the 'missing self hypothesis' [3] , provided that an activating receptor is engaged. These activating NK receptors bind to host-derived or pathogen-encoded ligands that are up-regulated on 'stressed' or infected cells. Upon activation, NK cells directly lyse target cells by exocytosis of perforin and granzymes and secrete cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-g and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, which mediate their immune response to infection. In this manner, NK cells function as important sentinels of the immune system, working as primary responders and alerting the host to the presence of infectious organisms.",

Several groups have recently examined the role of TLR9 and MyD88 in response to mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection by using MyD88deficient or TLR9-deficient mice. These immunodeficient mice had elevated amounts of virus in their spleens and livers compared with wild-type mice, which indicates an increased susceptibility to infection and suggests a crucial role for TLR9 and MyD88 in immunity to MCMV [4,5,6 ,7 ] . Infection by MCMV activated IFN-producing cells and myeloid DCs, resulting in the production of IFN-a and IL-12 through pathways dependent upon MyD88 and TLR9 [5] . Mice that lacked MyD88 or TLR9 had reduced amounts of IFN-a and IFN-b, interleukin (IL)-12, macrophage inflammatory protein 1a (MIP-1a) and IFN-g in their sera [4, 5, 6 ] . Of note, NK cells from MCMV-infected TLR9-and MyD88deficient mice produced less IFN-g [4, 5] , had impaired proliferation, and displayed reduced cytolytic activity compared with NK cells from MCMV-infected wild-type mice [5] . In addition, MCMV-infected CD11b + DCs directly activated NK cell IFN-g production by a mechanism that required IFN-a and the NKG2D receptor on NK cells [6 ] .",

The original study used perforin-deficient mice on a C57BL/6 \u00c2 129 mixed genetic background, whereas the recent study used mice on a C57BL/6 background.

Recent experiments analyzing the NKG2D ligand MICA demonstrated that HCMV infection down-regulated a full-length isoform of MICA from the surface of infected fibroblasts, preventing lysis by the human NK cell line NKL [13] . However, a truncated form of MICA, which lacks a cytoplasmic tail owing to a frameshift mutation, was stably expressed on the surface of infected fibroblasts and was efficiently lysed by NKL [13] . Interestingly, the truncated allele was found to be the most common allele in several human populations [14] , which suggests that polymorphism in the MICA gene might allow for enhanced viral clearance through NKG2D-dependent activation of NK cells. CD155, the ligand for the NK cell activating receptors DNAM-1 (CD226) and TAC-TILE (CD96), was targeted for down-regulation by the HCMV glycoprotein UL141, rendering infected cells resistant to NK cell lysis [15 ] . Down-regulation of CD155 only occurred during infection of fibroblasts with low-passage strains or clinical isolates of HCMV, and UL141 functioned by preventing maturation of CD155 and retaining it in the endoplasmic reticulum [15 ] .",

Surprisingly, pp65 appeared to cause dissociation of NKp30 from its signaling component, CD3z, thereby inhibiting NKp30 activity [16] . The mechanism by which a virion tegument protein, such as pp65, might access the interaction site between NKp30 and CD3z on the NK cell plasma membrane remains unclear and will require further investigation.",

NK cells formed stable conjugates with infected RBCs [39] , and in some cases reorganized the actin cytoskeleton after conjugate formation [37 ] . Purified NK cells, however, only produced substantial amounts of IFN-g in the presence of monocytes [38 ] . In addition, IL-18 production by macrophages and MyD88 expression in both NK cells and macrophages were required to induce IFN-g production by mouse NK cells in response to infected RBCs [38 ] . Although NK cells can interact with infected RBCs, robust NK cell activation seems to require secretion of soluble mediators by macrophages or monocytes.

Depletion of NK cells from mice using the anti-asialo GM1 antibody did not affect survival when a low dose (1 \u00c2 10 4 ) of T. cruzi trypomastigotes was used for infection [41] ; however, when a higher dose was used (5 \u00c2 10 5 ), NK-depleted mice had compromised survival compared with C57BL/6 mice [42] . Interestingly, increased parasitemia was observed in NKdepleted mice infected with the lower dose of T. cruzi, possibly because NK cells could form intimate interactions with trypomastigotes and contribute to their lysis [41] . Lysis was independent of perforin but dependent upon IL-12 [41] , which suggests that monocytes or macrophages activated by T. cruzi might contribute to NK cell activation by producing IL-12. NK cell cytotoxicity and protection against T. cruzi infection was independent of NK T cells [42] .",

After infection with Shigella flexneri, RAG \u00c0/\u00c0 gc \u00c0/\u00c0 mice had severely compromised survival compared with wild-type mice, possibly owing to reduced production of IL-1, IL-6, TNF and IL-12 [43] .

Human NK cells cultured with Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected monocytes up-regulated expression of the activating receptors NKp30, NKp46 and NKG2D and lysed infected monocytes through NKG2D-and NKp46dependent mechanisms; this is known because antibodies against these receptors inhibited cytotoxicity [44] . Infection of monocytes resulted in up-regulation of the NKG2D ligand ULBP1 through TLR2 activation [44] . Thus, NKG2D and NKp46 might mediate the NK cell response to M. tuberculosis infection.

This suggests a bystander 'innate' role for the T cells [47] . In addition, the transferred T cells localized with macrophages and LM lesions in the spleen and liver. By contrast, when NK cells were adoptively transferred into these recipients, the NK cells localized to the splenic red pulp, away from infected foci [47] . In this study, CD8 + T cells were shown to be the more significant player in innate immunity to LM.",

In particular, a role for NK cells in host defense against CMV in humans and mice is supported by the existence of viral mutation in response to NK cell-mediated immunity and the evolution of viral proteins that target the NKG2D ligands in CMV-infected cells. Although less well-studied, a developing theme is anti-parasitic and anti-bacterial immunity resulting from the interplay of NK cells with DCs and macrophages. However, NK cells might not always be beneficial in immune responses, as highlighted by recent observations that NK cells might promote the growth of rather than protect against LM. The future promises a better molecular definition of the mechanisms by which NK cells participate in innate immunity against these pathogens.",
