Of the total suspended bacteria cultured in an indoor environment, Staphylococcus was dominant and occupied 49.0 to 61.3 % of indoor air. Among Staphylococcus, S. aureus were detected in 100 % of households' indoor air ranging from 4 to 140 CFU/m 3 , and 66 % of households were positive for MRSA ranging from 2 to 80 CFU/m 3 . Staphylococcus and S. aureus concentrations correlated with indoor temperature (adjusted \u03b2: 0.4440 and 0.403, p<0.0001). Among respiratory viruses, adenovirus was detected in 14 (14 %) samples and influenza A virus was detected in 3 (3 %) samples regarding the indoor air of apartments. Adenovirus concentrations were generally higher in winter (mean concentration was 2,106 copies/m 3 ) than in spring (mean concentration was 173 copies/m 3 ), with concentrations ranging between 12 and 560 copies/m 3 . Also, a strong negative correlation between adenovirus concentrations and relative humidity in indoor air was observed (r = \u22120.808, p < 0.01). Furthermore, temperature also negatively correlated with adenovirus concentrations (r=\u22120.559, p<0.05).",

But recently, a study reported that Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were present in indoor bioaerosol of general homes, which is considered to be one of the most common pathogens for outbreaks of food poisoning and an important cause of skin infections and invasive diseases (Lowy 1998) . S. aureus is also the most prevalent cause of hospital-and community-acquired blood stream, skin and soft tissue, and lower respiratory infections (Diekema et al. 2001) . Moreover, identified indoor S. aureus were particularly resistant to common antibiotics such as ampicillin, penicillin, and cefaclor (Gandara et al. 2006) . Especially, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has become a significant and increasing cause of nosocomial infections and one of the most prevalent pathogens worldwide, with a significant economic impact on healthcare systems (Rhee and Woo 2010) .",

To determine the relative viral genome copy, a standard curve was generated from 10-fold serial dilutions of the Adeno standard template stock solution (5\u00d710 8 / \u03bcL) and analyzed concurrently with all qPCR reactions. A negative control without template was also included in all realtime PCR reactions. All reactions were run in duplicate and averaged.",

In this study, S. aureus were detected in 100 % of households' indoor air, and 66 % of households were positive for MRSA. S. aureus and MRSA are usually transmitted by direct person to person contact; however, routes of indirect transmission might include environmental exposure through aerosols (Davis et al. 2012) . Several case reports have implicated positive home environment for MRSA as persistent sources of infection (Uhlemann et al. 2011) . There are many studies for people with MRSA in hospitals and communities (Davis et al. 2012) . However, until now, insufficient studies have been conducted on MRSA in residential indoor air. In this study, although we did not isolate MRSA from family members and environmental surfaces, we suggest that household indoor air contamination from MRSA might contribute to colonization of healthy family members.",

Airborne respiratory viruses are easily spread by droplets that can be inhaled directly or settle on surfaces. However, respiratory viruses are difficult to characterize in the airborne environment due to their small particle size and low concentration and the presence of a wide range of contaminants which can inhibit laboratory assays (Fabian et al. 2009 ). Some researchers have detected airborne respiratory viruses in the field, such as office environments, health centers, and hospital rooms (Blachere et al. 2009; Myatt et al. 2004; Tseng et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2011) . Wan et al. reported that approximately 18 % of the air samples from the pediatric emergency room of the Children's Hospital in Taiwan were found to contain adenovirus, and the detected concentrations of adenovirus in the air ranged from 48.4 to 461 copies/m 3 (Wan et al. 2012) . In another study, Yang et al. collected samples in the health center and the day care center, 33 % of the health center samples and 75 % of the day care center samples were confirmed to contain aerosolized influenza A virus (Yang et al. 2011) . The average concentrations of influenza A virus was 1.6\u00d710 4 copies/m 3 .",
