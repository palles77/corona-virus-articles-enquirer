Rodents are natural reservoirs of hantaviruses; however, recent studies have demonstrated that insectivores and bats also represent hosts for divergent hantaviruses (Xu et al., 2015; Zhang, 2014; Witkowski et al., 2016) . Bats are considered the natural reservoir of a large variety of zoonotic viruses causing serious human diseases, such as lyssaviruses, henipaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Ebola virus (Li et al., 2010) . Genetically divergent bat-borne hantaviruses have been identified in Africa -Mouyassue virus (MOYV) in Cote d'Ivoire (Sumibcay et al., 2012) , Magboi virus (MGBV) in Sierra Leone (Weiss et al., 2012) , and Makokou virus (MAKV) in Gabon (Witkowski et al., 2016) and in Asia -Xuan Son virus (XSV) in Vietnam (Arai et al., 2013) , Huangpi virus (HUPV), Longquan virus (LQUV), Laibin virus (LBV) in China (Xu et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2013) , and Quezon virus (QZNV) in the Philippines (Arai et al., 2016) . Here we report the detection of a novel hantavirus, tentatively named Brno virus (BRNV), in the European insectivorous bat species Nyctalus noctula collected in the Czech Republic, Central Europe. For genetic characterization, the three genome segments were sequenced by high-throughput sequencing (HTS).",

Briefly, RNA was extracted from the liver tissue (QIAamp RNeasy mini Kit, Qiagen) and its concentration was measured with a Nanodrop 1000 photometer (RNA concentrations in the two samples were of 1545.91 ng/\u03bcl and 896.98 ng/\u03bcl). A purification and concentration step with RNA clean beads (Beckman Coulter) followed. Synthesis of cDNA was performed with a cDNA Synthesis kit (Roche) and resulting cDNA was fragmented by M220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Corvaris). This fragmented cDNA with an average length of about 500 bp was used for library preparation (Gene Read Library Prep Kit, Qiagen). The library was purified and size selected using AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter). Optimal size distribution and quality of the resulting library were verified on a Bioanalyzer in combination with a DNA High Sensitivity Chip (Agilent). The library was quantified with the Ion Library Taqman Quantitation Kit (ThermoFisher). Sequencing was performed on an Ion Personal Genome Machine (ThermoFisher) according to manufacturer's guidelines.",

Reads classified as related to the family Bunyaviridae were extracted and de-novo assembled into contigs using 454 Sequencing System Software (version 3.0). Resulting contigs were subsequently analyzed using the BioEdit software 7.2.5 (Hall, 1999) and Geneious 9.0.5 (Kearse et al., 2012) . The lengths of the sequences of S, M and L gene segments were 1441, 3575 and 6528 nt, respectively, encoding nucleocapsid protein (N), glycoprotein precursor (GPC) and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) proteins of 423, 1136 and 2145 amino acids in length, respectively (GenBank accession numbers: KX845678, KX845679, KX845680). Sequence comparison revealed that the three genome segments and the encoded proteins of BRNV showed 54.7-78.3% nucleotide and 44.5-81.7% amino acid sequence identity with other bat-borne hantaviruses while sequence identity with hantaviruses from rodents, shrews and moles ranged between 50.1 and 64.8%at the nucleotide and between 38.9 and 64.1% at amino acid level (Table 1) .",

The current ICTV criteria also include serological differences in virus neutralization, preventing virus classification without a cell culture isolate. However, a new proposal for species demarcation criteria (assigned code of the proposal: 2016.023a,bM; available for download at https:// talk.ictvonline.org), submitted by the ICTV Bunyaviridae Study Group, is currently under consideration which allows the classification solely based on genetic data. It is based on a concatenated multiple sequence alignment of complete amino acid sequences of the N and GPC proteins which is used to calculate PED (pairwise evolutionary distances) values using WAG amino acid substitution matrix. A species of the genus Hantavirus is defined by a PED value greater than 0.1. According to this criterion, BRNV clearly represents a new hantavirus species because the lowest PED value, observed for the most closely related LQUV, is 0.5.",

Evolutionary analysis was conducted in MEGA7 (15). The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum-Likelihood method based on the General Time Reversible (GTR) model with using a discrete Gamma distribution (+ G) with 5 rate categories and by assuming that a certain fraction of sites are evolutionarily invariable (+ I) which was estimated to be the Best-Fit substitution model according to Bayesian Information Criterion. The scale bars indicate an evolutionary distance in substitutions per position in the sequence. Bootstrap values \u226570%, calculated from 500 replicates, are shown at the tree branches. The insert shows the phylogenetic group containing all bat-borne hantaviruses (marked by bat pictogram) in greater detail. Rodent-borne hantaviruses associated with members of the families Muridae or Cricetidae are indicated by grey-shaded background.",
