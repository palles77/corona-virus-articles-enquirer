Recent evidence supports the view that selective transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface in the central vacuolar system could simply occur by bulk flow: according to this model, after folding and assembly of secretory and membrane proteins into their native 3-dimensional structure, they are transported out of the ER to the plasma membrane, and only proteins which have specific retention signals are retained in intracellular compartments (Klausner, 1989; Pelham, 1988; Rose and Doms, 1988; Rothman, 1987; Wieland et a/., 1987) . Assembly of enveloped viruses of several families, e.g., coronaviruses, bunyaviruses, and flaviviruses, takes place by budding at intracellular membranes, and the corresponding viral glycoproteins accumulate intracellularly rather than being transported to the cell surface (Leary and Blair, 1980; Matsuoka et a/., 1988; Murphy et a/., 1973; Tooze and Tooze, 1985) . Machamer and Rose (1987) found that the first of three hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains of the coronavirus El glycoprotein, a Golgi membrane protein, is required for its retention.

There are also hydrophobic domains near the carboxy termini of the Gl and G2 proteins, followed by charged amino acids, similar to the \"stop transfer\" sequences seen in the transmembrane domains of other viral envelope proteins (Garoff et al., 1980; lhara et al., 1985; Rose et al., 1980) . This suggests that each of the two glycoproteins encoded in the polyprotein precursor may have its own signal sequence and membrane anchor sequence, analogous to the internal signal sequence and membrane anchor sequences described for the El protein of the alphaviruses, Semliki forest virus, and Sindbis virus (Garoff et al., 1980; Hashimoto et a/., 1981; Rice and Strauss, 1981) . However, virtually no direct evidence is available about the sequences responsible for targeting of the nascent PTV proteins to the ER membrane or the domains responsible for membrane anchorage. The PTV G 1 and G2 glycoproteins, when expressed from a recombinant vaccinia virus, are specifically retained in the Golgi complex (Matsuoka et al., 1988; Chen et al., 1991) . The NS, sequence was ruled out as a retention signal for the glycoproteins, indicating that the structural features of the Gl and/or G2 glycoproteins are responsible for their Golgi retention.",

This transient expression system is based on infection of the cells with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and subsequent transfection with the plasmid DNA containing the gene to be expressed under control of the T7 promoter. Transcription of the gene is mediated by the T7 polymerase produced in the cytoplasm by the recombinant vaccinia virus (Fuerst et a/., 1986) . We used a modification of the system by cloning the genes of interest into pGEM-3, pGEM-3Z, or pGEM-4Z plasmids under the control of a T7 promoter, but lacking a transcriptional termination sequence (Pattnaik and Wertz, 1990) . The pGEM-G plasmid, which contains the PTV Gl and G2 coding sequence under control of the T7 promoter, was initially used to investigate the expression and localization of the glycoproteins (Fig.  1) . It was found that the Gl and G2 glycoproteins were expressed, cleaved, and glycosylated in the transfected cells as detected by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE (not shown), indicating that expression and processing of the Gl and G2 proteins occurred efficiently using the T7 expression system. HeLa T4+ cells retained relatively normal morphology for over 24 hr post-transfection while expressing high levels of the Gl and G2 glycoproteins. The localization of the Gl and G2 proteins was found to be in a perinuclear Golgi pattern, as observed previously in vaccinia recombinant W-G-infected cells (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, a similar pattern of Golgi localization of the proteins was also detected in the Vero, HeLa, or BHK cell lines when the proteins were expressed by the T7 transient system at early time points post-transfection. Thus, the Golgi targeting of PTV glycoproteins occurs using various cell types and expression systems, and either the T7 transient expression system or the vaccinia recombinant system can be used to study the targeting of glycoprotein constructs.",

To identify the protein products, HeLa T4+ cells infected with VV-T7 were transfected with the recombinant plasmid DNA, labeled for 15 min, and then chased for the indicated times. As shown in Fig.  8 , a 63 kDa molecular weight band corresponding to native Gl, and a 52-kDa molecular weight band smaller than the native G2 protein, were found in the cell lysates by SDS-PAGE. No PTV-specific protein was found on the cell surface or in the medium for up to a 12-hr chase. Endo H treatment showed that a fraction of the Gl-truncated G2 protein was incompletely processed to endo H-resistant forms as the chase continued, suggesting that these molecules reached the Golgi complex (Fig. 6C ). The localization of the truncated Gl -G2 proteins was further examined by immunofluorescence staining. No specific fluorescence was detected on the cell surface (Figs. 9e and 9f) . In permeabilized cells, the intracellular localization of both the Gl and truncated G2 proteins appeared predominantly in a perinuclear Golgi pattern after the cell culture was treated with cycloheximide for 4 hr (Figs. 9a and 9b). The Golgi localization of the glycoproteins was further indicated by BFA treatment, which caused the perinuclear distribution pattern of the Gl and truncated G2 proteins to change into a dispersed ER-like pattern (Figs. 9c and 9d), as seen for resident Golgi proteins in response to BFA treatment (Lippincott-Schwartz et a/., 1989) . Thus, in contrast to the secreto fixation, then BFA (10 pg/ml) was added to the culture medium for 20 min.

One construct (G2(HH)), containing a partial deletion of the presumptive signal peptide, was transcribed and translated into a G2-specific protein in vitro, but no protein product was detected in cells infected with the corresponding vaccinia recombinant virus. In contrast, using a construct containing the full hydrophobic sequence preceding G2, which has all the characteristics of a signal peptide as described by von Heijne (1984) the G2 protein was found to be stably produced and glycosylated in viva. Newly synthesized membrane proteins that fail to undergo translocation into the ER have been reported to be extremely unstable in the cytoplasm (Gething and Sambrook, 1982; Sekikwa and Lai, 1983) . Thus, a likely reason for not detecting a protein product in W-G2(HH)-transfected cells is rapid proteolysis of the untranslocated protein. These results provide evidence that translocation of the G2 protein into the ER can be mediated by a thirteen amino acid hydrophobic sequence, preceding the G2 protein, as a signal peptide. The internally located signal sequences of the PTV polyproteins are similar to those of the Semliki Forest virus structural polyprotein, although the translocational signal peptide of the El protein is located in the C-terminus of a 6-kDa protein rather than the structural protein p62 (Liljestrom and Garoff, 1991; Melancon and Garoff, 1986) .",

This conclusion is consistent with the membrane topology analysis predicted from the deduced amino acid sequence. Since all potential glycosylation sites in the G2 are located in the N-terminal side of the membrane anchor domain, and the G2 protein is glycosylated, we conclude that the G2 glycoprotein is a class I membrane protein with the topology depicted in Fig. 10 .",

We investigated the possibility that this C-terminal sequence of the short cytoplasmic tail may serve as a retention signal, since the C-terminal tetrapeptides WHDEL of the luminal ER proteins have been well defined as an ER retention signal (Munro and Pelham, 1987; Pelham, 1988 ) and a tiULtiI C;UMt'LtX LUC;HLILHI IUN Ut C-terminal consensus sequence in ER membrane proteins was also identified as a signal for their ER retention (Jackson eta/., 1990; Nilsson eta/., 1989) . Interestingly, the G2 C-terminal sequence corresponds to this consensus ER-retention signal, with lysines positioned three and four or five residues from the C-terminus (Jackson et al., 1990) . In contrast to our expectation, a full-length G2 protein was found to be transported to the cell surface. Further, a truncated Gl -G2 protein, in which the G2 C-terminal sequence was deleted, was transported out of the ER, and still targeted to the Golgi complex. Thus, the C-terminal sequence of the G2 glycoprotein does not serve as an ER retention signal or function to maintain a conformation needed for Golgi retention of the Gl and G2 protein. These results indicate that the consensus motif of basic residues at the C-terminus of transmembrane proteins (Jackson et a/., 1990) does not always represent an ER-retention signal, since the PTV glycoproteins with or without this consensus motif are transported out of the ER.",

Furthermore, the anchor-minus G2 protein was found to be secreted into the medium. Thus, we conclude that the G2 glycoprotein does not contain a specific signal for Golgi retention. In contrast to misfolded or unassembled proteins which fail to exit the ER (Copeland et a/., 1988; Doms et al., 1988; Gething et al., 1986; Rose and Doms, 1988) , the PTV membrane glycoproteins are transported out of the ER, but specifically retained in the Golgi complex. Our results indicate that Golgi localization of the G2 glycoprotein requires its interaction with the Gl glycoprotein. This conclusion is supported by the following evidence: (1) The anchor minus G2 protein is secreted into medium, whereas it is retained in the Golgi complex when coexpressed with the Gl protein; (2) The G2 protein when expressed individually is transported to the cell surface, whereas it is retained in the Golgi complex when expressed together with the Gl protein. Thus, it seems likely that a Golgi retention signal is present on the Gl protein. Studies to identify a possible retention signal in the Gl protein are in progress. Alternatively, a functional retention signal might require formation of a complex between the Gl and G2 proteins. We recently observed that the majority of the Gl and G2 glycoprotein are assembled into noncova-IHt i-'UNIH IUKU VIKUY b;IL YKUItlN 505 lently linked Gl -G2 heterodimers, and that the G2 Cterminal and transmembrane domains are not required for dimerization (S.Y. Chen and R. W. Compans, manuscript in preparation). The dimerization of the Gl and G2 glycoproteins was also recently reported in Uukuniemi virus-infected cells (Persson and Pettersson, 1991) .",

Similarly, glycosyltransferases, which are resident membrane proteins of the Golgi complex and the ER, show virtually no sequence homology in their deduced amino acid sequences, but they have a common transmembrane topology with a short NH,-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a 16-to 20-amino acid signal-anchor domain, and an extended stem region which is followed by the large COOH-terminal catalytic domain Shaper et al., 1988; Weinstein et al., 1987) . When various Golgi resident membrane proteins, the coronavirus El glycoprotein (a class III membrane protein), bunyavirus Gl and G2 glycoproteins (class I membrane proteins), and glycosyltransferases (class II membrane proteins) are compared, no sequence homology or similarity of hydropathy profiles among these proteins was found. We believe that these membrane proteins do not employ the same strategy as luminal ER proteins which use a short linear C-terminal sequence as a retention signal. Alternatively, all of these proteins may have a similar signal patch as proposed for lysosomal enzymes specifically recognized by Iv-acetylglucosaminylphosphotransferase (Dahms et a/., 1989; Kornfeld, 1990) , which cannot be observed by analysis of the linear sequence.",
