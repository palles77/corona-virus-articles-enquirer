Twelve virus-specific oligonucleotide probes for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were divided into a high GC content group (\u2265 50%) and a low GC content group (< 50%), and spotted onto four different chemically-modified glass surfaces: a poly-amine coating activated by 1,4-phenylene diisothiocyanate (Poly-Amine surface), an acrylic acid-co-acrylamide copolymer coating activated by 1-(3-dimethylamino propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide (AACA-Copolymer surface), a commercial Corning CMT-GAPS amino surface, and a Telechem SuperAmine amino surface. RNA samples from cultured SARS-CoV strain were labelled using direct cDNA labelling with restriction display in a single colour format. The background-subtracted signal intensities were analysed using two-way analysis of variance. The effects of glass surfaces on background-subtracted signal intensities were significant (p = 0.003). Multiple comparisons showed that differences existed mainly between the AACA-Copolymer surface and the other glass surfaces, and that the AACA-Copolymer surface had the highest background-subtracted signal intensity. The probe GC content had no significant effect on signal intensities in the narrow range of GC content represented (p = 0.07). The results suggested that the AACA-Copolymer surface may be a novel choice of microorganism survey based on long oligonucleotide microarray.",

Its use has a broad applicability including medical clinics, microbial ecology, agriculture, and biodefense surveys (Zhou and Thompson, 2002; Zhou, 2003; Bodrossy et al., 2004; Lemarchand et al., 2004; Sergeev et al., 2004) . Previous studies have shown that long oligonucleotide diagnostic microarrays (50-70 mer) are more efficient than short oligonucleotide (20-30 mer) or cDNA microarrays in microbial diversity detection (Zhou, 2003) . Compared to the short oligonucleotide diagnostic microarrays, the long oligonucleotide diagnostic microarrays do not require high-redundancy probe design. Compared to the cDNA diagnostic microarrays, the long oligonucleotide diagnostic microarrays have many advantages including a broader range of uniform hybridisation conditions, lower overall costs, they are less labour intensive, and the potential for quantisation (Bodrossy et al., 2004) .The long oligonucleotide diagnostic microarrays have been used widely to identify microorganisms from soil (Zhou and Thompson, 2002) , water (Lemarchand et al., 2004) , the intestinal tract (Vora et al., 2004) , and the respiratory tract (Wang et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "Long oligonucleotide diagnostic microarray experiments are a multi-step process and each step is a potential source of variation for signal intensities (Mo et al., 2006) . Variations affecting the signal intensities can be generally classified into three categories: biological variation, technical variation, and residual error. Biological variation is intrinsic to all microorganisms; it may be introduced by the genetic characteristics of microorganisms. For example, pathogens sequence divergence affected signal intensities of long oligonucleotide diagnostic microarray (Zhou, 2003; Reed et al., 2007) . Technical variation is introduced during microarray fabrication, sample preparation, hybridisation and washing procedure, array scanning, data analysis, and so on. Although many efforts have been made to develop uniform microbial separation, extraction, and purification of sample nucleic acids, sample labelling methods, and mathematical methods (Lemarchand et al., 2004; Vora et al., 2004; Mo et al., 2006; Reed et al., 2007; Tembe et al., 2007) , a standard protocol for long oligonucleotide diagnostic microarrays has not been well-established. In order to achieve a standardised methodology it is crucial to first evaluate the effects of the factors at each experimental step that contribute to the variability in signal intensities of long oligonucleotide diagnostic microarrays.",

Recently, two different chemically-modified glass surfaces, an poly-amine coating activated by 1,4-phenylene diisothiocyanate (Poly-Amine surface) and an acrylic acid-co-acrylamide copolymer coating activated by 1-(3-dimethylamino propyl)-3ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride /N-hydroxysuccinimide (AACA-Copolymer surface), have been developed for microarray fabrication (Wu et al., 2005) . The \u00cf phase cDNA diagnostic microarrays experiments on the Poly-Amine surface and the AACA-Copolymer surface showed spots that were uniform and regular (Wu et al., 2005) . However, the immo-bilisation of long oligonucleotide probes on these two glass surfaces has not been investigated. In this report we compared the Poly-Amine and AACA-Copolymer surfaces with the commercial Corning CMT-GAPS and Telechem SuperAmine amino surfaces, and we examined the effects of glass surfaces and probe GC content on signal intensities of a 60mer diagnostic microarray were studied.",

Another study indicated there were consid-erable differences in DNA retention characteristics among commercially available poly-L-lysine and amino-coated slides (Hessner et al., 2004) . In this paper, the effects of four different glass surfaces, the Poly-Amine surface, the AACA-Copolymer surface, the Corning CMT-GAPS amino surface, and the Telechem SuperAmine amino surface, as well as the effects of oligonucleotide probe GC content on signal intensities of a 60-mer diagnostic microarray were studied. The signal intensities clearly varied between glass surfaces, with the AACA-Copolymer surface showing the highest background-subtracted signal intensities. Within the narrow range of GC contents represented, the average signal intensities for the high GC contents group was not statistically different from that of the low GC content group.

Spot replicates of each probe and slide replicates of each glass surface were applied in this study. Twoway ANOVA was used to identify the main effect of glass surfaces, the main effect of probe GC content, and their interaction effect, while other possible sources of variation due sample genetic characteristics, virus RNA extraction, sample fluorescent labelling, microarray hybridisation, image scanning, and data analysis were controlled. Unfortunately, because only twelve SARS-CoV-specific probes were fit for the criteria (Mo et al., 2006) , the potential limitation in this study is that investigating the influ- Twelve virus-specific oligonucleotide probes were divided into a high GC contents group (n = 4) and a low GC content group (n = 8), and spotted onto four different chemically-modified glass surfaces. All data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. The coefficients of variation (CV) of signal intensities for the probes and glass surfaces were calculated based on the following formula: CV = standard deviation/ mean of background-subtracted signal intensities. The p-value ( # ) indicated local background signal intensity difference between glass surfaces and was generated by Kruskal-Wallis test. Two-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the main effects (*) and the interaction effect (**).",

The highest backgroundsubtracted signal intensities were seen on the AACA-Copolymer surface suggesting that signal intensities differences between glass surfaces arose from the intrinsic properties of chemical modification methods themselves. First, the acrylic acid-coacrylamide copolymers with dendrimeric structure and swellable characteristics were used as the coating agents on the AACA-Copolymer surface, which greatly increased the immobilising area for oligonucleotide probes. Second, the 1-(3-dimethylamino propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) were used as activators on the AACA-Copolymer surface. The EDC speeds the covalent linkage reactions between amino groups on the silanised glass surface and the acrylic acid-co-acrylamide copolymers. In addition to the similar function as the EDC, the NHS provided the chemical groups to link covalently with the amino groups of oligonucleotide probes.",

First, the self-fabricated glass surfaces produced low background signal intensities after hybridisation (Wu et al., 2005) ; this is the result of repulsion between the increasing hydrophilic amines and hydrophobic dye molecules (e.g., cyanine). Second, introducing covalent bonds into poly ammoniates and/or dendrimeric copolymer system on the self-fabricated glass surfaces clearly increased the covalent linking ability and loading capacity (Wu et al., 2005) . Finally, the self-fabricated glass surfaces, which contain with more positive charges, were more suitable for immobilising long oligonucleotide probes.",
