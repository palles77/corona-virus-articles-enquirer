IEF of intact virions allowed the differentiation of rabbit from human papilloma viruses, polioviruses from echoviruses and smallpox from whitepox (Zerda and Gerba, 1985) . IEF has also been employed in studying the development of charge heterogeneity in individual viral proteins, known as microheterogeneity (Hsu and Kingsbury, 1985; Bosch, 1985) . Microheterogeneity is usually the result of post-translational modification, causing the addition of negatively charged groups, such as sialic acid or sulfate in the oligosaccharide site chains of glycoproteins (Hubbard and Ivatt, 1981) . Phosphorylation may be the cause of charge heterogeneity of non-glycosylated viral proteins. Combining of IEF in polyacrylamide gels with identification of the separated proteins using antibodies (Catsimpoolas, 1969) , further enhanced the usefulness of IEF for the characterization of proteins. In addition, IEF has been used to separate antibody clonotypes which were subsequently either immobilized in the isoelectric focusing gels or transferred to nitrocellulose (NC) membranes and detected by reacting them with the appropriate antigens or haptens (Askonas et al., 1970; Keck et al., 1973; Nye and Roitt, 1980; Vandvik et al., 1982; Friedenson and Soong, 1984) . Knisley and Rodkey (1986) developed a method, designated affinity immunoblotting, for analyzing clonotypic changes of specific antibody produced during the immune response to a particular antigen, by reacting IEF separated antibody molecules with antigen-coated NC membranes. The specific antibody molecules were bound to the antigen on the NC membranes and were detected using peroxidaseconjugated anti-IgG.",

Electrode wicks were saturated with 1 M NaOH (cathode) and 1 M H3P04 (anode). 75 microliters of lysate (non-labeled) prepared as described above, was applied to the gel surface using pieces of Whatman no. 1 filter paper. The IEF protocol began with an initial setting of 100 V (constant voltage) for 30 min, 200 V (constant voltage) for an additional 30 min, then 20 W (constant power) for 30 min, and 30 W (constant power) for an additional 2 h. The pH gradient was measured immediately after focusing using a flat surface pH electrode. The recorded pH values were adjusted according to Gelsema et al.

This finding is not unexpected since the S peplomer protein has 21 glycosylation sites (Schmidt et al., 1987) . The S peplomer protein like many other N-linked glycoproteins contains both mannose and fucose, but no N-acetylgalactosamine (Holmes et al., 1981) . It is synthesized on membrane-bound ribosomes as N-glycosylated polypeptide with molecular weight of 150,000. During transport through Golgi, glycosylation take place resulting in a 180,000 mol wt. S glycoprotein (Holmes et al., 1981; Siddell et al., 1981) . The fact that the S peplomer protein of the ts mutants and the wt MHV-JHM have identical molecular weights suggest that the microheterogeneity that we observed is due to differences in glycosylation.",
