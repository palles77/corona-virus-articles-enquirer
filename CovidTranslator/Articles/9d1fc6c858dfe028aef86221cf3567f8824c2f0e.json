            "text": "The Asia-Pacific region is home to more than half of the global population and accounted for 62\u00b76% of global deaths due to liver diseases in 2015. 54\u00b73% of global deaths due to cirrhosis, 72\u00b77% of global deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma, and more than two-thirds of the global burden of acute viral hepatitis occurred in this region in 2015. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection caused more than half of the deaths due to cirrhosis in the region, followed by alcohol consumption (20\u00b78%), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; 12\u00b71%), and chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV; 15\u00b77%). In 2015, HBV accounted for about half the cases of hepatocellular carcinoma in the region. Preventive strategies for viral hepatitis-related liver disease include increasing access to clean drinking water and sanitation. HBV vaccination programmes for neonates have been implemented by all countries, although birthdose coverage is extremely suboptimal in some. Availability of screening tests for blood and tissue, donor recall policies, and harm reduction strategies are in their initial stages in most countries. Many governments have put HBV and HCV drugs on their essential medicines lists and the availability of generic versions of these drugs has reduced costs. Efforts to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat, together with the rapid increase in per-capita alcohol consumption in countries and the epidemic of obesity, are expected to change the spectrum of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region in the near future. The increasing burden of alcohol-related liver diseases can be contained through government policies to limit consumption and promote less harmful patterns of alcohol use, which are in place in some countries but need to be enforced more strictly. Steps are needed to control obesity and NAFLD, including policies to promote healthy lifestyles and regulate the food industry. Inadequate infrastructure and insufficient health-care personnel trained in liver diseases are issues that also need to be addressed in the Asia-Pacific region. The policy response of most governments to liver diseases has thus far been inadequate and poorly funded. There must be a renewed focus on prevention, early detection, timely referral, and research into the best means to introduce and improve health interventions to reduce the burden of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region.",

Deaths in the Asia-Pacific region represented three-quarters of the global total number of deaths due to acute viral hepatitis. In 2015, the region accounted for three-quarters of the global total number of deaths related to acute HBV, almost two-thirds of those due to acute hepatitis A infection, and almost 80% of those due to acute hepatitis E infection. Of all deaths due to acute viral hepatitis in the region for that year, most were caused by acute hepatitis B infection (59\u00b76%) and acute hepatitis E infection (32\u00b71%), whereas only 6\u00b73% were due to acute hepatitis A. By comparison, in 2015, of all deaths related to acute viral hepatitis, hepatitis B infection caused 81\u00b77% in the USA and 70\u00b70% in Europe, hepatitis E caused no deaths in the USA and 8\u00b73% in Europe, and hepatitis A caused 13\u00b74% in the USA and 18\u00b70% in Europe (figure 5). 1 Given the large contribution of the Asia-Pacific region to the global burden of liver diseases, the epidemiology and aetiology of the region's burden need to be reviewed. In this Commission, we document the burden of liver diseases in the region and formulate recommendations to tackle it. It was not feasible to cover every country in the Asia-Pacific region in this Commission. Thus, to maximise our scope by including territories at various stages of development, we divided",

The Asia-Pacific region accounts for 62\u00b76% of 2 095 207 deaths due to liver diseases globally for that year. In Asian countries, the median proportion of deaths attributable to liver disease was 3\u00b79% (range 1\u00b786-13\u00b79). By contrast, liver diseases caused 2\u00b705% of all deaths in Australia and 1\u00b733% of those in New Zealand in 2015 (figure 1), with underlying aetiologies varying between countries (figure 2). 1 Cirrhosis is the leading cause of liver-related deaths in the Asia-Pacific region, accounting for 630 843 (48\u00b72%) of such deaths in 2015, compared with 46 941 (64\u00b78%) of those in the USA and 115 075 (58\u00b74%) of those in Europe. Deaths due to cirrhosis in the Asia-Pacific region in 2015 represented 54\u00b73% of 1 161 914 cirrhosis-related deaths globally; the region accounted for almost 70% of global cirrhosis-related deaths due to HBV, almost 40% of those due to HCV, just under half of those related to alcohol consumption, and just over a half of those due to NAFLD or other causes (eg, autoimmune, cholestatic, metabolic, or drug-induced liver diseases). In the region, 51\u00b73% of deaths due to cirrhosis were caused by HBV, compared with 18\u00b74% in the USA and 24\u00b73% in Europe; HCV caused 15\u00b77% of deaths due to cirrhosis (vs 37\u00b75% in the USA and 32\u00b76% in Europe), alcohol consumption caused 20\u00b78% (31\u00b72% in the USA and 30\u00b79% in Europe), and NAFLD and other diseases caused 12\u00b71% (12\u00b78% in the USA and 12\u00b71% in Europe; figure 3). 1 The second largest cause of liver-related deaths in the Asia-Pacific region is liver cancer, which accounted for 573 361 (43\u00b76%) of all 2015 liver-related deaths in the region, compared with 24 565 (33\u00b79%) of those in the USA and 78 072 (39\u00b74%) of those in Europe. These deaths represent almost three-quarters of the estimated global number of deaths due to liver cancer for that year; the region accounted for more than 80% of the global total of HBV-related liver cancer deaths, just under half of those due to HCV, more than 70% of those that were alcohol-related, and more than three-quarters of those due to other causes including NAFLD. In 2015, HBV infection caused 49\u00b71% of all deaths due to liver cancer in the Asia-Pacific region (vs 12\u00b77% in the USA and 20\u00b74% in Europe), HCV infection caused 10\u00b78% (37\u00b71% in the USA and 37\u00b72% in Europe), 29\u00b78% were due to alcohol consumption (38\u00b71% in the USA and 37\u00b71% in Europe), and NAFLD and other diseases caused 10\u00b71% (12\u00b71% in the USA and 5\u00b73% in Europe; figure 4 ). 1 The remaining major contributor to liver-related deaths in the Asia-Pacific region is acute viral hepatitis, which i v e s S r i L a n k a V i e t n a m B a n g la d e s h B h u t a n I n d i a N e p a l P a k i s t a n M a la y s i a T h a i la n d i v e s S r i L a n k a V i e t n a m B a n g la d e s h B h u t a n I n d i a N e p a l P a k i s t a n M a la y s i a T h a i la n d i v e s S r i L a n k a V i e t n a m B a n g la d e s h B h u t a n I n d i a N e p a l P a k i s t a n M a la y s i a T h a i la n d ; table 1 shows demographics and health and socioeconomic indicators). 2 Given its achievements in controlling HBV, we also included Taiwan when discussing HBVrelated liver disease.

In Asia-Pacific, China accounts for a large proportion of the regional burden of viral hepatitis, particularly HBV, with prevalence in 2018 of more than 80 million estimated chronic infections. 4 Nevertheless, the country is moving towards elimination of viral hepatitis 4 via a universal HBV vaccination programme in infants and mandatory screening of blood products for HBV and HCV, 5 and has exceeded WHO's Western Pacific regional target for HBV vaccination and reduction of HBsAg prevalence in children younger than 5 years. 4 According to a 2015 systematic review, 6 the estimated HBsAg endemicity in mainland China decreased from 14\u00b70% in 1957-89 to 5\u00b74% in 1990-2013. More recently, a modelling study 7 estimated HBsAg prevalence in China to be 6\u00b71%. In national surveys, the prevalence of HBsAg in the general population decreased from 9\u00b78% in 1992 to 7\u00b72% in 2006. 8 In people aged 1-29 years, the prevalence of HBsAg decreased from 10\u00b71% in 1992 to 5\u00b75% in 2006 and to 2\u00b76% in 2014. 9 Nonetheless, there are still an estimated 77-97 million people with chronic HBV infection in China, including more than 20-30 million with active liver disease, 7 of whom 7 million need urgent treatment because of advanced fibrosis or high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. 8 The average annual cost per case of HBVrelated liver disease in China was estimated at US$4454\u00b70 (direct), $924\u00b73 (indirect), and $6611\u00b710 (intangible). 10 Overall, the nationwide prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies has drastically declined from 3\u00b72% in 1992 to i v e s S r i L a n k a V i e t n a m B a n g la d e s h B h u t a n I n d i a N e p a l P a k i s t a n M a la y s i a T h a i la n d 37 190 (2016) ( Table 1 continues on next page)",

Since the implementation of mandatory HCV screening for blood products, infection via transfusion has decreased significantly (eg, in Beijing, the proportion of new infections caused by blood transfusion was 84\u00b72% before 1992 and 14\u00b73% after 2004). 13 With the adoption of mandatory nucleic acid testing for HBV and HCV in donated blood since 2013, transfusion-related HCV infections will decrease further. Infection via non-transfusion medical procedures procedures was infrequent in Beijing in the period before implementation of mandatory HCV screening for blood products (accounting for 7\u00b70% of HCV infections before 1992), but this proportion has increased over time (accounting for 33\u00b73% of HCV infections after 2004). 13 Similar data showing continuously decreasing HCV transmission via blood transfusion and a concomitant increase in HCV transmission via intravenous drug use, unsafe sexual behaviour, and invasive procedures outside health-care settings (eg, piercings, tattoos, acupuncture, barbershop shaving, etc) have been reported in Beijing, as well as in other parts of mainland China. 14, 15 Between 2010 and 2012, disease sentinel surveillance identified that the incidence of HCV seropositivity was highest in people who inject drugs and who require haemodialysis, and was far lower, but not negligible, in the sexually active general population. 11 As is the case in China, the greatest contributing factor to the burden of liver disease in India is viral hepatitis, particularly HBV. According to estimates from the 2015 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study, 1, 16 hepatitis B infection accounted for 33% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases and for 42% or all deaths due to liver cancer, whereas hepatitis C accounted for 22% and 20% of deaths, respectively. Acute hepatitis B and C infections accounted for 55% and 1\u00b74% of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in India in 2015 (table 2) . 1 Community data on the burden of disease caused by chronic liver diseases due to hepatitis B and C are scarce. On the basis of a systematic review of published literature, the propor tion of liver diseases attributable to HBV was 67%, 17-19% for HCV, and 71-72% for either virus (some patients had HBV-HCV co-infection). 17 Further, the annual number of deaths from liver cancer attributable to these viruses was estimated to be 113 14 (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) Liver cancer due to hepatitis C 172 11 (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) Cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases 239 239 13 (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) Data are mean estimated deaths (95% CI) and include all ages and sexes. *Based on the Ministry of Health's communicable disease surveillance report 2000-16. 3 Table 2 : Estimated deaths due to liver diseases in selected countries and territories in the Asia-Pacific region for 2015 1 The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology Commission approximately 17 000 for HBV, 4500 for HCV, and 18 500 for either or both viruses. 17 Data on HBV seroprevalence in India are available from blood-bank screening and a few community-based studies, with marked variation across studies. 18 On the basis of data from 19 studies from the mid-1990s, 19 the prevalence of HBV infection was estimated at 4\u00b77%. Subsequent literature reviews and meta-analyses have provided estimates of 2\u00b74% and 3\u00b77%. 20, 21 A 2015 global systematic review of HBV prevalence included 129 studies from India; of these, 24 reported (with 46 463 participants) data up to 1989 and 106 (3\u00b77 million people) thereafter. 6 Pooled prevalence was estimated at 2\u00b76% before 1989 and 1\u00b74% after. 6 A 2018 modelling study found that the prevalence of HBsAg in India in 2016 was 2\u00b75% (95% CI 2\u00b72-2\u00b77). 7 Some tribal groups have a higher prevalence of HBV infection than the general population; 18 however, these sub populations are small and their disease burden was deemed unlikely to influence the overall estimates.",

According to the GHE 2015 dataset, hepatitis B infection in Indonesia accounted for 37\u00b70% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases and for 29\u00b71% of all deaths due to liver cancer, whereas these proportions were 35\u00b78% and 35\u00b72% for hepatitis C (table 2) . 1 Acute hepatitis B and C infection accounted for 78\u00b71% and 3\u00b71% of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in Indonesia in 2015. 1 Information about the prevalence of HBV and HCV in the general Indonesian population is unavailable because of inadequate disease surveillance and probable under-reporting, geographical barriers for collecting data on 250 million people living on more than 17 000 islands, and few testing facilities. The prevalence of HBsAg ranged from 4% to 20\u00b73% in 1990-97, 31 making Indonesia a country with intermediateto-high endemicity of hepatitis B. HBsAg prevalence during that period ranged between 37% and 76% in patients with liver cirrhosis and was 37-68% in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. 31 Efforts to collect nationallevel data were made in 2007 through Indonesia's Basic Health Research survey (known as RISKESDAS) in 21 of 33 provinces. The prevalence of HBsAg in 2007 was 9\u00b74%, that of anti-HBc was 32\u00b78%, and of anti-HBs was 30\u00b76%. 32, 33 A nationwide study in 2015 covering 33 provinces showed that the prevalence of HBsAg was 7\u00b71%, that of anti-HBc was 31\u00b79%, and of anti-HBs was 35\u00b76%. 34 These data showed a decline in the prevalence of HBsAg (9\u00b74% in 2007 to 7\u00b71% in 2013), suggesting that Indonesia has moved from high endemicity to moderate endemicity of hepatitis B (appendix p 1).",

With 5 000 000 pregnancies per year in Indonesia, approximately 150 000 pregnant mothers could potentially transmit HBV to their babies annually, of whom 95% will develop chronic hepatitis B and be infectious for their entire lives. This transmission incidence is of serious concern, considering that coverage of HBV birth-dose vaccination is low, screening tests for HBV in pregnant women are not routinely done, and antiviral treatment for women infected with HBV has not been adopted as a preventive strategy for mother-to-child transmission. 31 A 2018 study 37 showed that hepatitis B is an important occupational hazard for health-care workers in Indonesia. The study reported that the acquisition of HBV infection (indicated by anti-HBc prevalence) and the evidence of repeated natural boosting (indicated by anti-HBs prevalence together with either or both HBsAg and anti-HBc) increased significantly with the length of service period and the type of work (administrative, nonintervention, and intervention). Needle injury was confirmed to be the greatest risk factor for acquiring HBV among health-care workers. 37 Information on hepatitis C prevalence in Indonesia are also scarce.

            "text": "that anti-HCV prevalence was 1\u00b75% in Java and 1\u00b70% outside Java. 32 Data from the RISKESDAS surveys in 2007 and 2013 reported anti-HCV prevalence of 0\u00b78% and 1\u00b70%, with high prevalence in children (1-14 years of age; 0\u00b75% in 2007 and 0\u00b76% in 2013). 38, 39 The Indonesian Red Cross notified between 8400 and 12 100 individuals annually that they had HCV infection acquired through receiving blood transfusion in 2010-14. 37 It was estimated that there were 1 284 000 viraemic individuals in 2014, projected to increase to 1 303 000 by 2023. 37 A survey in 2012 showed that 2\u00b75% of the population infected with HCV were active injecting drug users. Of an estimated 70 000 (95% CI 61 901-88 320) people who inject drugs, 77\u00b73% (95% CI 40-80) had HCV infection. Assuming spontaneous clearance in 20% of cases, the number of viraemic people who inject drugs was estimated to be 22 400-43 680. 37 In Pakistan, HCV has replaced HBV as the most common cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. 40, 41 Up to 86% of cases of cirrhosis and 58% of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma in Pakistan have been attributed to HCV. [40] [41] [42] According to the GHE 2015 dataset, hepatitis B accounted for 28\u00b76% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases and for 28\u00b78% of all deaths due to liver cancer in Pakistan, whereas hepatitis C accounted for 44\u00b72% and 51\u00b71% of such deaths, respectively (table 2) . 1 Acute hepatitis B infection caused 49\u00b72%, and acute hepatitis C infection caused 2\u00b73%, of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in Pakistan in 2015. 1 An increased prevalence of either HBV or HCV has been reported in prisoners. 43, 44 HDV has been reported in 16\u00b76-44% of patients with hepatitis B. 42 The first Pakistani national survey 45 done in 2008 reported that the overall prevalence of HCV was 4\u00b78% and of HBV was 2\u00b75% for that year, with an estimated 13 million people having co-infections. Reusing syringes for therapeutic injections, receipt of contaminated blood or blood products, reuse of razors by barbers, and medical exposure to contaminated sharps were the major risk factors (appendix p 2). 45, 46 The prevalence of HCV in Pakistan is projected to increase by approximately 60% over the next 15 years, which is equivalent to 1 million new cases annually, representing 10% of the global HCV burden by 2030. 42 It has been estimated that 510 000 HCV cases treated annually, mass screening, effective awareness campaigns, and availability of sterile equipment would significantly reduce burden of HCV and avert 220 000 liver-related deaths and 116 000 new cases of liver cancer cases in Pakistan in the next 15 years. 42 As with other Asian countries, HBV and HCV cause the most cases of chronic liver disease in Japan. HCV is the most prevalent cause of such deaths: in 2015, 27\u00b78% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, and 27\u00b71% of those due to liver cancer, were caused by hepatitis B, whereas 49\u00b78% and 53\u00b72% of them were caused by hepatitis C (table 2). 1 For that year, hepatitis B accounted for 93\u00b79%, and hepatitis C for 3\u00b76%, of all deaths due to acute hepatitis infection. 1 The chronic carrier prevalence of HCV in Japan in 2005 was reported to be 0\u00b78% in people aged 60-64 years, which has gradually decreased, and was reported as 0\u00b707% in people aged 20-24 years for the same year. 47 174-236 cases of acute hepatitis B cases per year were reported for the period of 2006-15 to the Governmental Registry of Japan. 48 70% of these new acute HBV infections were sexually transmitted. 49 The number of cases of acute hepatitis C is currently not known, but about 27 to 52 cases of acute hepatitis C were reported to the Registry per year for 2006-15. 48 Since records began in 1958, until 1970, there were no drastic changes in mortality due to viral hepatitis-related hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan(appendix p 4). 50, 51 However, an exponential increase in the incidence of, and deaths from, primary liver cancer began in the early 1970s and peaked in the early 2000s (appendix p 4). 50 This marked increase is most likely explained by an increase of HCV infection in the era after WW2 in the so-called babyboomer generation. 50 After plateauing in 2002-04, the number of deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma has started to decline and was 28 889 in 2015. 51 The Japanese Government introduced a universal health insurance coverage system in the 1960s, which covered almost 90% of total overall medical costs. 52 Consequently, expensive surgeries requiring blood trans fusion (eg, total gastrectomy for peptic ulcer) were widely done. 53 Contaminated syringes were frequently used in medical settings for intravenous infusion of vitamins, to supposedly counteract the common cold or to improve spirits. 53 This practice continued until a few years after the discovery of HCV in 1989. Subsequently, introduction of nucleic-acid amplification testing for HCV, HBV, and HIV in blood products by the Japanese Red Cross in 1999, and screening of pregnant women for HBV infection, lead to a decline in hepatocellular carcinoma cases due to viruses transmitted by transfusion. 51 The incidence of transfusion-transmitted viral hepatitis in people who had a transfusion in 2007 was reported to be 0\u00b70007%. 54 In Japan, mother-to-child transmission is the major route of establishing chronicity of HBV, but it is less common than in other Asian countries. From June, 1985, all pregnant women were screened for the presence of serum HBsAg, and from January, 1986, the Government started financing programmes for prevention of vertical transmission of HBV infection. 55 A retrospective, nationwide, multicentre study in 430 patients born between 1976 and 2010 who were younger than 20 years when diagnosed with chronic HBV infection showed that the number of cases according to birth year increased within this timeframe. After the introduction of perinatal immuno prophylaxis of HBV vaccination plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin (IgG) in 1986, the proportion of chronic HBV infections caused by mother-to-child transmission decreased from 73% between 1981 and 1985 to 47% between 1986 and 1990. However, mother-to-child To identify the causes of the increase in mother-to-child transmission despite perinatal immunoprophylaxis, the association between the implementation of immunoprophylaxis and chronic HBV infection was evaluated. The prevalence of confirmed lack of immuno prophylaxis decreased continuously from 38% between 1986 and 1990 to 9% between 2006 and 2010. Similarly, the proportion of patients with no medical record of immunoprophylaxis also decreased from 38% between 1986 and 1990 to 3% between 2006 and 2010. The prevalence of incomplete prophylaxis ranged from 30% to 50% across the 1986-2010 period. By contrast, the prevalence of complete prophylaxis increased continuously from 0% between 1986 and 1990 to 55% between 2006 and 2010. These findings indicate that the increase in chronic HBV infection due to mother-to-child transmission was probably caused by poor efficacy of the prophylaxis regimens or the antibodies used.",

            "text": "By contrast with trends in Pakistan and Japan, HBV is the most common cause of liver diseases in Bangladesh. According to the GHE 2015 dataset, hepatitis B caused 48\u00b71% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases and 45\u00b73% of all deaths due to liver cancer in Bangladesh (table 2) . 1 Conversely, hepatitis C, the second leading cause of chronic liver diseases in Bangladesh, accounted for 29\u00b79% and 31\u00b76% of these deaths. Hepatitis B also accounted for 64\u00b73%, and hepatitis C for 1\u00b77%, of all deaths due to acute hepatitis. 1 Hospital-based data indicate that 60% of cirrhosis cases 56 and 65% of hepatocellular carcinoma cases 57 in Bangladesh are thought to be direct consequences of HBV infection, while HCV accounts for 30% of cirrhosis cases and 17% of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. 56, 57 In the absence of a nationwide seroprevalence study of HBV, high variability in the prevalence of HBsAg in Bangladesh has been shown. Several studies from the 2000s show variation from 0\u00b77% to 5\u00b75% in the general population. 58, 59 However, these proportions are lower than those reported by Islam and colleagues in 1984. 60 Risk factors for HBV transmission in Bangladesh include treatment by non-qualified medical practitioners, shaving and hair-cutting with shared razors in barber shops, body piercing, dental procedures, and intravenous infusion, together with mass vaccination against smallpox and cholera. 58, 59 Chronic hepatitis B infection that is negative for HBeAg and positive for anti-HBe is common in Bangladeshi patients. 61 Data from Bangladesh on HCV prevalence is sparse, but is reported to be low (0\u00b784%). 62 Prevalence is as high as 40% in people who inject drugs with unknown HIV status and 60\u00b77% in those with HIV co-infection; therefore, the burden of HCV is highest in people who inject drugs. 63 Most people who do not inject drugs but are infected with HCV have a history of any injection (treatment by non-qualified village doctors), sharing blades in barber shop, or of circumcision by traditional practitioners. 63 In South Korea, similar to Bangladesh, HBV is the most prevalent cause of chronic and acute liver disease. According to the GHE 2015 dataset, hepatitis B accounted for 56\u00b73% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, and for 60\u00b75% of those due to liver cancer (table 2) . 1 Hepatitis C infections caused 11\u00b78% and 15\u00b75% of such deaths, respectively. 1 Acute hepatitis B and C accounted for 98\u00b77% and 0\u00b74%, respectively, of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in South Korea in 2015. 1 Although the prevalence of HBV in the general population was around 8% until the 1980s, the introduction of a HBV vaccine in South Korea in 1983, and the national vaccination programme in 1995, have lowered the prevalence of HBV to about 3% in adults and to less than 1% in children. 64 The overall prevalence of HBV continues to decline; nonetheless, around 2 million people still carry the virus. In South Korea, HBV-HDV co-infection is very rare.",

According to GHE estimates in 2015, 37\u00b77% deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, and 34\u00b70% of those due to liver cancer, resulted from hepatitis B infection (table 2) . 1 21\u00b76% and 20\u00b78% of these deaths were due to hepatitis C. 1 Acute hepatitis B and C infection accounted for 56\u00b76% and 17\u00b75% of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in Australia in 2015. 1 In Australia, hepatocellular carcinoma is the fastest growing incident cancer; it is now in the top 10 causes of total cancer death and the seventh cause of cancer deaths in men. 71 Between 2011 and 2020, the annual incidence of liver cancer in Australia is projected to increase from 1520 to 2465 cases. 72 Liver cancer incidence for 1989-90 was also 5-10 times greater in Indigenous than in non-Indigenous Australians, with 12 times higher expected mortality for Indigenous than non-Indigenous people. 73 These prevalence estimates seem to have substantially improved on the basis of 2017 data, 72 in which Indigenous Australians had 2\u00b78 times higher age-standardised incidence and 2\u00b75 times higher mortality than non-Indigenous Australians. Notably, although survival for many cancers has improved over the past two decades in Australia and globally, there has been no improvement in liver cancer prognosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma remains the fastest-growing cause of cancer death in Australia. 5-year survival is just 15% (18% if the cancer is localised and 2% if metastasis occurs). 72 According to the most recent 2017 estimation, 72 between 1982 and 2017 the greatest estimated proportional increase in mortality was from liver cancer (from 2\u00b73% to 6\u00b78% per 100 000 individuals). 72 Currently, more than 1400 Australians die from liver cancer each year and a third of those diagnosed do so within a month of diagnosis. 72 HBV or HCV is linked to 30% of hepatocellular carcinoma cases in Australia.",

The age-standardised incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma per 1000 personyears decreased 2\u00b73% (95% CI 1\u00b74-3\u00b71) in 2001 to 0\u00b79 (0\u00b76-1\u00b72) in 2012 in patients with HBV and remained stable between 2001 (1\u00b74, 0\u00b78-1\u00b79) and 2012 (1\u00b75, 1\u00b72-1\u00b77) in those with HCV. 74 Thus, individuallevel risk of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma had decreased, suggesting that antiviral therapy introduced in the mid-2000s has been effective. By contrast, HCV treatment based on interferons had no effect on individual-level, HCV-related risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and has contributed to the increasing population burden of this cancer type.",

            "text": "Australia has required notification of all cases of viral hepatitis B and C since the early 1990s. This mandatory notification system has helped to monitor the epidemiology of viral hepatitis and, more importantly, has enabled a coordinated public health response. 218 000 (1%) of the Australian population (plausible range 192 000-284 000) are estimated to be living with chronic hepatitis B infection. 75 Overall notification of newly acquired hepatitis B (ie, infection acquired within the preceding 24 months) has decreased from 1\u00b72 per 100 000 individuals in 2009 to 0\u00b77 per 100 000 in 2013. 76 Notification of newly acquired HBV infection has been consistently low across this period in children younger than 15 years and has declined substantially in people aged 15-29 years. Adolescent catch-up immunisation programmes could have contributed to this decrease in young adults. However, there was an increase in complications related to chronic HBV such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma from 450 cases in 2008 to 1550 in 2017. 77 The seroprevalence of HBsAg in Indigenous Australian adults was estimated to be 17% in a meta-analysis of studies done before 2000. 78 Since then, HBsAg sero prevalence in Indigenous Australians is estimated to have declined to 3\u00b77% of the 548 366 total population in 2011. This seroprevalence is still more than 10 times that in non-Indigenous Australians born in Australia (0\u00b73% of 13 836 559, excluding people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men). 79 The prevalence of detectable HCV RNA in the general population in 2014 was approximately 0\u00b79% (range 0\u00b77-1\u00b70%), of Australia representing 227 000 people (range 167 620-249 710). 75 However, the number of new HCV infections in Australia has declined since 2000, with modelling studies suggesting that incidence peaked at 14 000 infections in 1999 and then fell to 8500-9000 in 2013 in young adults (aged 20-39 years). 80, 81 This decline is attributed to the improvement in harm reduction measures and a reduction in the prevalence of the use of injectable drugs. 82 8% of newly diagnosed cases of HCV in 2014 were in Aboriginal people. 83 The notification of newly diagnosed HCV cases in Aboriginal people increased by 38%, from 119 per 100 000 people in 2010 to 164 per 100 000 in 2014. 83 By contrast in non-Aboriginal people, notification of new cases decreased by 15%, from 41 per 100 000 people in 2010 to 35 per 100 000 in 2014. 83 Similar to Australia, HBV is a major cause of liver disease in New Zealand. In New Zealand, hepatitis B accounted for 35\u00b76% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, and 31\u00b72% of all deaths due to liver cancer in 2015, according to GHE data (table 2). 1 20\u00b74% and 17\u00b79% of these deaths were due to hepatitis C. 1 Acute hepatitis B and C accounted for 97\u00b71% and 0\u00b7009% of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in New Zealand in 2015. 1 The quality of epidemiological data for The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology Commission viral hepatitis from New Zealand is poor compared with that in Australia, probably because viral hepatitis is not a disease for which notification is compulsory in New Zealand. However, in 2012, there were an estimated 50 000 (1\u00b75%) people aged 15 years and older with HCV, and approximately 1000 new cases are identified each year. 84 It was estimated that only half of the people in this age group are currently diagnosed and only a quarter are aware that they have the disease. 84 Approximately 90 000 individuals are living with chronic HBV infection. 85 In New Zealand, there was an increase in the incidence of liver cancer, from 145 in 1999 to 253 new registrations in 2009 and high fatality (from 127 to 208 people) in the same period. 86 There are four main ethnic groups in New Zealand (European, M\u0101ori, Pacific Islander, and Asian), with smaller proportions identifying with other ethnic groups. Liver cancer is the fourth most common in incidence and mortality in M\u0101ori men. In this group, hepatocellular carcinoma registration and mortality were almost 3\u00b75 times those of non-M\u0101ori men in 2010-12, 87 which has perhaps declined since a study done in 1983-94 that suggested that M\u0101ori people had a 7 times higher risk than non-M\u0101ori people, 88 and a further study in 1981-2004 that indicated that risk was 4\u00b779 times higher. 89 HBV is also the main contributor to the liver disease burden in Singapore. In Singapore, according to the GHE 2015 dataset, hepatitis B accounted for 69\u00b72% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, and for 66\u00b76% of all deaths due to liver cancer (table 2). 1 These proportions were 17\u00b76% and 16\u00b79% for hepatitis C. 1 Acute hepatitis B and C accounted for 7\u00b74% and 42\u00b76% of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in Singapore in 2015. 1 In the Singapore Burden of Disease Survey, 90 liver cirrhosis contributed 0\u00b79% of the 182 752 years of life lost (YLL) in 2010. Additionally, in a study of patients with liver cirrhosis from a hospital-based population, the main aetiologies were chronic HBV infection (63\u00b73%) and chronic HCV infection (6\u00b79%). 91 Liver cancer in Singapore is ranked as the fourth most common cancer in men by the Singapore Cancer Registry for 2010-14, 92 and the fifth most common cancer in men for 2011-15 by the Singaporean Ministry of Health, with an age-adjusted prevalence of 17\u00b76 cases per 100 000 people. 93 In the Singapore Burden of Disease Survey 2010, liver cancer contributed 5886 disabilityadjusted life years (DALYs), equivalent to 1\u00b75% of total DALYs, and 5783 YLL (3\u00b72% of the total). 90 The aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma is not clearly documented, but in a large patient cohort who had surgical resection, 55\u00b76% of cases were due to chronic HBV infection and 6\u00b72% to chronic HCV infection. 94 Between 1973 and 2012, the incidence of liver cancer declined steadily. The incidence in men decreased from 27\u00b74 cases in 100 000 people in 1973-77 to 17\u00b72 in 100 000 in 2008-12, whereas the incidence in women decreased from 6\u00b79 in 100 000 in 1973-77 to 4\u00b78 in 100 000 in 2008-12. This decrease is possibly due to the introduction of voluntary HBV vaccination in 1985 as an integral part of the national childhood immunisation programme and improved screening.",

Large community-based epidemiology surveil lance found that HEV genotype 4 was the dominant type, indicative of zoonotic transmission. 122 China has made progress in preventing HAV and HEV transmission through improving food and water hygiene, as well as vaccination against HAV. 123 A vaccine against HEV has been approved in mainland China, with shortterm and long-term efficacy being reported. 124 Similar to China, HAV and HEV are common causes of acute hepatitis-related mortality in India. In India, according to the GHE 2015 dataset, 1 hepatitis A and E accounted for 6\u00b73% and 37\u00b72% of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in 2015. 1 HAV is highly prevalent in the Indian population. A systematic review of studies during 1980-2008 showed that seroprevalence exceeded 90% in adolescents and adults, 125 although some pockets of epidemiological transition with lower seroprevalence are emerging in urban high-income groups, 126 leading to outbreaks. 127, 128 HEV infection is hyperendemic in India and its neighbouring countries. The transmission is primarily through faecal contamination of water supplies. Outbreaks of acute hepatitis E are common; the largest recorded outbreak in the country, in 1990, had about 79 000 cases. 128 Additionally, HEV infection accounts for 30-50% of cases of sporadic acute hepatitis. Only genotype 1 HEV has been isolated from human cases in India; genotype 4 has been isolated from pigs, but not from humans, suggesting that zoonotic transmission is rare. Chronic hepatitis E infection is infrequent.",

In Indonesia, acute hepatitis A and E infection accounted for 2\u00b79% and 15\u00b78% of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in 2015, according to the GHE 2015 dataset (table 2). 1 The prevalence of HAV infection varies among islands in Indonesia. It is endemic in some areas with sporadic cases every year, but it also occurs as spontaneous outbreaks in other parts of the country. In the 1990s, nearly all children aged 10-14 years in Jayapura (Papua New Guinea), Mataram (Lombok), and Sumbawa Besar (Sumbawa) were infected with HAV, but only about 45-60% children in the same age group in Jakarta (Java), Bandung (Java), and Makassar (Sulawesi) had had this infection. 131 With improved socioeconomic status, hygiene, and sanitation, the prevalence of anti-HAV in these areas declined since 2000. 131 In 2006, the prevalence of anti-HAV was 60% in young adults aged 18-20 years in Jayapura and Biak (Biak). However, the prevalence was still high (up to 90%) in isolated areas of Biak island, with predominantly indigenous populations. 132 The decrease of anti-HAV prevalence was also observed in Lombok, where anti-HAV prevalence in students aged 12-14 years decreased from 64\u00b78% to 13\u00b76% over 30 years, from 1986 to 2016. 132 Hepatitis A outbreaks, which occurred in several areas in Java (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) and in Sumatra and Borneo (2014), have been reported more frequently in areas with low prevalence of anti-HAV. Health education, as well as hygiene and sanitation promotion programmes, have been implemented in areas with hepatitis A endemicity. However, HAV vaccination is still not widespread and is not included in the national immunisation schedule, so it is only available to people in wealthy urban areas.",

            "text": "There are few reports about hepatitis E in Indonesia. Only three outbreaks of HEV infection that occurred in 1987, 1991, and 1998 have been documented in restricted areas (west Kalimantan [Borneo] and east Java) and were presumably caused by faecal contamination. [133] [134] [135] It has also been reported that HEV is transmitted to humans through the consumption of uncooked or undercooked pork and viscera. 136 In addition to outbreaks, HEV infection accounts for a considerable proportion of sporadic hepatitis infections with varying prevalence of anti-HEV in apparently healthy individuals in some areas. 137 The risk of infection has been found to increase in association with occupational contact with swine and swine excrement. 136, 137 Infection in humans is mostly due to genotype 1, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic. 136 However, it was reported that genotype 4 has also been isolated from people with acute hepatitis E infection. 138 In Pakistan, mortality related to acute hepatitis is also commonly caused by HAV and HEV. According to the GHE 2015 dataset, acute hepatitis A and E accounted for 18\u00b78% and 29\u00b77% of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in the country (table 2). 1 Lack of clean water, poor sanitation practices, poor access to health facilities across the country, social and political upheavals, and many refugees are the main factors responsible for the high number of sporadic cases of HAV and HEV in Pakistan. The Viral Hepatitis Surveillance System in Pakistan reported 3825 cases of acute hepatitis from June, 2010, to October, 2014, of which 679 were due to acute HAV and 468 to acute HEV. 139 Most children in Pakistan contract hepatitis A at an early age, leading to an almost 100% exposure by the age of 14 years, but HAV was reported in only 6% of adults. 42, 140 Despite a subclinical, asymptomatic course in most children, acute liver failure was reported in 30 of 232 children with HAV seen at Aga Khan University Hospital (Karachi), with 36\u00b77% mortality from 1991 to 1998. 141 Approximately 80% of acute hepatitis in adults is attributed to HEV. In Pakistan, epidemics of acute viral hepatitis were reported as early as the 1950s and 1960s. Many outbreaks of hepatitis E had been wrongly assumed to be caused by HAV. 42, 142 HEV has been found to be the main cause of acute-on-chronic liver failure in patients with underlying liver disease 143, 144 and acute liver failure in pregnant women, with maternal mortality ranges from 36-71%. The frequency of acute liver failure is higher (10-22%) in pregnant women with HEV infection than in men and non-pregnant women (1-2%). 145 HEV genotype 1 is prevalent in Pakistan, mainly transmitted via the faecal-oral route, 146, 147 consistent with the observation that 44\u00b77% of samples from sewage water samples and fresh vegetables are contaminated with HEV. 148 The disease's subclinical course, the patient's expected self-recovery, and the high cost or unavailability of diagnostic tests for HAV and HEV mean that most cases are undiagnosed, leading to underestimated disease burden. 42 Similar to Pakistan, HAV and HEV are common causes of mortality due to acute hepatitis in Bangladesh. Hepatitis A and E accounted for 2\u00b78% and 31\u00b71% of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in Bangladesh in 2015 (table 2) . 1 Historically, hepatitis A infection was thought to be hyperendemic in Bangladesh; a study from 2000 showed that 100% of children up to 6 years of age had been exposed and were immune to HAV. 149 A 2009 seroepidemiological study showed a clear trend",

Hepatitis A accounted for 2\u00b73% of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in 2015, whereas there were no deaths due to acute hepatitis E, according to the GHE 2015 dataset (table 2). 1 The number of cases with acute hepatitis caused by HAV that were reported to the Governmental Registry of Japan ranged from 128 to 433 cases per year in Japan and there has been no change in this incidence in the past 10 years. 48 However, the incidence of acute hepatitis E has gradually increased from 2005 to 2013. 48 There were 44 to 60 cases of acute HEV infection per year from 2006 to 2011, but this prevalence increased to more than 200 cases in 2015. This increase might be related to eating raw pork liver and boar and deer meat. 48 Similar to Japan, HAV and HEV are rare causes of acute hepatitis-related mortality in South Korea: according to the GHE 2015 dataset, acute hepatitis A accounted for 0\u00b78% of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in 2015, whereas there were no deaths due to acute hepatitis E (table 2). 1 Improvements in sanitation and living standards have contributed to a change in the epidemiology of acute viral hepatitis in South Korea. The decrease in HAV infection in young children has resulted in a reduction in the seroprevalence of anti-HAV IgG, with a corresponding increase observed in the adult population. 157 As a result, since 2000, hepatitis A has overtaken hepatitis B as the leading cause of acute viral hepatitis in adults in South Korea. 158 In 2009, the incidence of hepatitis A was at its highest since 2000, and 15 231 cases were reported to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but in 2010 the number decreased to 7655. 159 HAV infection was designated a national notifiable disease in 2001, and a surveillance system based on sentinel hospitals was established. The incidence has continuously decreased since 2011, the year when the surveillance system was expanded to every hospital. 7585 cases of HAV infection were reported through this National Infectious Diseases Surveillance system between 2011 and 2013, steadily declining in each of those years. 160 Of these cases, 58 were caused by infection outside the country, and 7527 patients represented autochthonous HAV infection cases. 160 HAV comprises up to 80% of all acute hepatitis infections in South Korea. 67 HEV is not endemic in South Korea and is responsible for only 2% of acute viral hepatitis cases. 161 Surprisingly, the seroprevalence for anti-HEV antibody was about 17-34% in South Koreans, according to surveys of the general population and blood donors done between 2003 and 2009, suggesting that there are many undetected, subclinical HEV infection cases. 161, 162 Unlike South Korea, HAV is a common cause of deaths related to acute hepatitis in Australia, whereas HEV is a rare cause and only a few cases have ever been reported. Hepatitis A accounted for 25\u00b79% of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in 2015 in Australia, whereas there were no deaths due to acute hepatitis E (table 2). 1 In Australia, the number of hepatitis A cases reported per year has been declining nationally since the late 1990s from approximately 300-500 cases to 144 in 2011. 163 Infection is usually related to high-risk groups such as infants in childcare facilities, users of injected drugs, men who have sex with men, and travellers to countries where infection is common. Occasional outbreaks due to consumption of contaminated shellfish have been reported. Hepatitis A vaccination is therefore recommended for high-risk groups.",

In 2012-16, 323 cases of acute hepatitis A and 345 cases of acute hepatitis E were reported. 3 Most of these cases were local residents who contracted the disease overseas or foreigners who were working in Singapore. However, the overall number of cases has been declining and no deaths from acute hepatitis A and E have been reported between 2012 and 2016. For the entire 1997-2016 period, 1899 cases of hepatitis A and 961 cases of hepatitis E were reported. 96 In summary, viral hepatitis A and E are a major cause of acute hepatitis-related morbidity and mortality in countries with medium and high HDIs in the Asia-Pacific region, the population of which has low access to clean drinking water and appropriate sanitation facilities. In these areas, acute HEV infection causes high mortality, especially in pregnant women and in patients with underlying chronic liver diseases. Acute HAV is increasingly leading to severe hepatitis in adults as the quality of sanitation is improving in certain localised areas of these regions, reducing earlier exposure and immunity to infection. In countries with very high HDIs, acute HAV, although rare, is seen predominantly in travellers to endemic areas, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs. Conversely, acute HEV infection is predominantly zoonotic and is acquired by eating infected meat or handling pigs.",

The prevalence of alcohol-related liver disease in some Chinese studies ranges from 2\u00b73% to 6\u00b71% for the 2003-11 period, with a median prevalence of 4\u00b75% in heavy drinkers with a drinking history of more than 5 years. [166] [167] [168] [169] Incidence was at least 50% for alcohol-related steatosis, at least 10% for alcohol-related hepatitis, and at least 10% for alcohol-related cirrhosis, in heavy drinkers with a 5-year drinking history. 170 In eastern China (Shandong province), the population-based prevalence of alcohol-related liver disease was 8\u00b755% in 2011. 171 Data from a big hospital specialising in infectious and liver diseases showed that alcohol-related liver disease accounted for 3\u00b793% of all liver diseases, with the proportion increasing from 1\u00b768% in 2002 to 4\u00b759% in 2013 in hospitalised patients with liver diseases. 172 Similarly, the proportion of patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis increased from 3\u00b734% in 2002 to 8\u00b740% in 2013, making it the third commonest cause of liver cirrhosis. 173 In 2016, WHO's estimates of total annual alcohol consumption per capita for that year in people aged 15 years and older in China was 7\u00b72 L of pure alcohol (11\u00b77 L in men and 2\u00b75 L in women), and total alcohol consumption per capita considering only people who drink (aged \u226515 years) was 26 L of pure alcohol (30\u00b75 L in men and 11\u00b73 L in women). 165 Overall, 42\u00b71% of people aged at least 15 years (29\u00b71% of men and 55\u00b76% of women) in mainland China abstain from alcohol throughout their lives. 165 The prevalence of heavy episodic drinking in 2016 for drinkers only (\u226515 years) was 40\u00b77% (52\u00b79% in men and 20\u00b71% in women). 165 Between 2006 and 2010, admissions to hospital for cirrhosis caused by viral hepatitis decreased by 10%, but admissions for alcohol-related cirrhosis increased by 33% in 31 hospitals in Beijing. 174 In India, alcohol consumption is also a common cause of liver disease-related mortality. Alcohol consumption accounted for 22\u00b72% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases and for 19\u00b79% of all deaths due to liver cancer in India, as reported by the GHE 2015 dataset (table 2) . 1 According to 2016 WHO estimates, agestandardised deaths from cirrhosis in adult Indian men and women were 45\u00b78 per 100 000 individuals per year and 14\u00b77 per 100 000 individuals per year, respectively, with 60\u00b70% (in men) and 33\u00b73% (in women) of these attributed to alcohol consumption. 165 This prevalence might be underestimated because of poor reporting, low social acceptance of drinking, and no insurance cover for alcoholrelated diseases. Of all deaths due to alcohol-related cirrhosis worldwide in 2015, 19\u00b78% were estimated to occur in India; this is a high proportion, given that the Indian population comprises 17\u00b78% of the global population, has a smaller proportion (72\u00b73%) of people aged at least 15 years than the global average, and has a very high proportion of lifetime alcohol abstainers (53\u00b75% of individuals aged \u226515 years in 2016) compared with other countries. 165 WHO estimates indicate that the numbers of deaths due to alcohol-related cirrhosis in India increased by 22\u00b77% (from 47 000 to 57 700) between 2000 and 2015. 1 Rising incomes have led to an increase in per-capita annual alcohol consumption in Indian adults (those 15 years and older), from 1\u00b78 L of pure alcohol in 2000 to 4\u00b73 L in 2010 and 5\u00b76 L in 2016. 165 In 2016, nearly 53\u00b75% (39\u00b71% of men and 68\u00b78% of women) of this age group were lifetime abstainers. The annual per-capita consumption of pure alcohol in current drinkers (aged \u226515 years) was 14\u00b76 L (18\u00b73 L in men and 6\u00b76 L in women). The prevalence of heavy episodic drinking in 2016 for drinkers only (\u226515 years) was 44\u00b74% (55\u00b71% in men vs 21\u00b74% in women).",

In 2016, WHO's estimates of total alcohol consumption per capita in adults aged at least 15 years for New Zealand was 10\u00b77 L of pure alcohol (17\u00b72 L in men and 4\u00b76 L in women) and total alcohol consumption per capita in drinkers from this age group was 14\u00b73 L of pure alcohol (20\u00b72 L in men and 7\u00b71 L in women). Overall 10\u00b76% of adults aged at least 15 years (5\u00b71% of men and 15\u00b78% of women) in New Zealand are life-time abstainers. The prevalence of heavy episodic drinking in 2016 for drinkers only (\u226515 years) was 42\u00b79% (58\u00b70% in men and 24\u00b74% in women). 165 Alcohol is responsible for a small but important proportion of deaths due to liver disease in Singapore. According to the GHE 2015 dataset, alcohol consumption accounted for 4\u00b79% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, and for 10\u00b78% of all deaths due to liver cancer (table 2) . 1 According to 2016 WHO estimates, age-standardised deaths from cirrhosis in adult Singaporean men and women were 4\u00b74 and 2\u00b74 per 100 000 individuals per year, respectively, and 30\u00b73% (in men) and 34\u00b79% (in women) of these were attributable to alcohol cosnumption. 165 The 2010 Singapore Burden of Disease survey reported that, in patients admitted for hospital treatment with liver cirrhosis in 1991-2010, 27\u00b76% of cases were alcohol-related and 68\u00b75% were non-alcoholrelated. 90 A study of 564 patients with liver cirrhosis treated in a major public hospital in Singapore showed that 11\u00b72% of these patients were admitted because of alcohol-related liver disease. 180 Consequently, alcohol-related liver disease can be considered a small but important cause of liver cirrhosis. In 2016, WHO's estimates of total alcohol consumption per capita in Singaporean adults aged at least 15 years was 2\u00b70 L of pure alcohol (3\u00b73 L in men and 0\u00b78 L in women) and total alcohol consumption per capita in this age group for drinkers only was 2\u00b79 L of pure alcohol (4\u00b70 L in men and 1\u00b74 L in women). Overall, 6\u00b77% of Singaporean adults aged at least 15 years (3\u00b71% of men and 10\u00b72% of women) never consume alcohol throughout their lives. The prevalence of heavy episodic drinking in 2016 for drinkers only (\u226515 years) was 42\u00b79% (57\u00b74% in men and 23\u00b75% in women). 165 In summary, commensurate with an increase in mean incomes, per-capita alcohol consumption has increased in the Asia-Pacific region, especially China and India, but not in Muslim-dominated countries. 181 A systematic analysis of comparative risk of 84 behavioural, environmental, occupational, and metabolic risk factors or clusters of risk factors (based on the GBD Study) reported that, globally, alcohol is estimated to be the seventhleading risk factor for DALYs in 2016 and that alcoholattributable DALYs have increased by more than 25% between 1990 and 2016, driven primarily by increased consumption in south Asia, southeast Asia, and central Asia, in both men and women. The largest increases in exposure have been in countries in the low-to-middle quintile of the GBD sociodemographic index (SDI). 182 These changes are likely to increase alcohol use and the burden of alcohol-related liver disease in the future.",

            "text": "GHE 2015 data show that NAFLD and other causes accounted for 11\u00b77% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, and for 10\u00b75% of all deaths due to liver cancer in mainland China (table 2). 1 Changing lifestyles and dietary habits have resulted in an increased prevalence of NAFLD in mainland China. Populationbased epidemiological studies have indicated that the prevalence of NAFLD in China is 6\u00b73-27\u00b70% in adults, with prevalence being higher in urban areas than rural areas, in men than women, and in the eastern coast than further inland. 170 As shown by a systematic review of articles published between 1997 and 2013, the overall prevalence of NAFLD was about 20% in mainland China. 184 The prevalence of NAFLD was reported to be 15\u00b735% in 2005 in Shanghai 185 and has approximately doubled in the past decade. 186 An estimated 1\u00b73-2\u00b71% of schoolchildren have NAFLD. 187 Incident NAFLD is not uncommon in lean people; a cross-sectional study of 6905 people without obesity 188 estimated that 7\u00b73% of them had NAFLD at baseline. By the end of the study's 5-year follow-up, 494 (8\u00b79%) of 5562 people who completed the study had developed NAFLD. Total case estimates of prevalent NAFLD in 2016 in China were 243\u00b767 million, with 32\u00b761 million cases of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 1\u00b709 million cases of cirrhosis, and 7000 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma due to NAFLD. 189 With economic growth in mainland China averaging 10% over the past 30 years, a westernised diet and a sedentary lifestyle have drastically reshaped the pattern of Chinese daily life. The gradually growing prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia, and metabolic syndrome has put the Chinese population at risk of developing NAFLD. 190 Similar to China, NAFLD is an important cause of liver disease-related mortality in India. The GHE 2015 dataset documented that NAFLD and other causes accounted for 10\u00b79% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, and for 9\u00b76% of all deaths due to liver cancer (table 2). 1 Risk of developing NAFLD is influenced by several environmental and metabolic factors, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and physical inactivity, which are common in the Indian population. 191 In the general population, according to community-based studies, the prevalence of NAFLD on ultrasonography in urban areas was 18\u00b79% in 2007 and 32\u00b70% in 2009, 192, 193 and in rural areas was 8\u00b77% in 2010 and 30\u00b77% in 2016. 194, 195 In urban, hospital-based studies, this prevalence was 25\u00b73% in 2012 and 32\u00b72% in 2009. 196, 197 The prevalence is higher in highrisk groups, such as people with type 2 diabetes (10\u00b75-88%) 198, 199 or obese people (50-80%). 192, 200 11-32% of patients with NAFLD had a normal body-mass index (BMI). 201 The number of overweight and obese adults in India had nearly doubled to 18\u00b76% in 2015-16 from 9\u00b73% in 2005-06 in men, and to 20\u00b77% from 12\u00b76% in women. 202 Additionally, there are currently 69\u00b72 million adults with type 2 diabetes aged 20-79 years, and this population is likely to increase to 123\u00b75 million by 2040, 203 which would probably lead to an increase in the burden of NAFLD.",

            "text": "Indian patients are scarce. In hospital-based studies between 2003 and 2011, cryptogenic cirrhosis, believed to be largely due to NAFLD progression, accounted for 15\u00b78-48\u00b78% of patients with cirrhosis. 206 Additionally, 4\u00b76-19% of patients with liver cancer did not have hepatitis B or C or did not drink alcohol. 207, 208 In Indonesia, NAFLD is also becoming an important cause of liver disease-related mortality. According to the GHE 2015 dataset, NAFLD and other causes accounted for 17\u00b74% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, and for 20\u00b79% of those due to liver cancer (table 2). 1 Data on the prevalence of NAFLD have been scarce in Indonesia. 209 However, risk factors for NAFLD (ie, type 2 diabetes, increased triglycerides, low HDLcholesterol, and metabolic syndrome exemplified by obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and increased waist circumference), are prevalent and increasing in Indonesia. 210 Age-standardised estimates for Indonesian adults aged 20 years and older analysed by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) showed increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes from 3\u00b72% for men and 4\u00b71% for women in 1975 to 7\u00b74% for men and 8\u00b70% for women in 2014 (appendix p 6). 210 They also showed an increase in the prevalence of obesity from 0\u00b72% for men and 0\u00b77% for women in 1975 to 5\u00b70% for men and 9\u00b73% for women in 2016. Moreover, age-standardised obesity for children and adolescents aged 5-19 years has drastically increased from 0\u00b710% in 1975 to 7\u00b71% in 2016. 211 These children and adolescents are at a high risk of progressive liver disease in the future because weight gain during school years carries a higher risk of NAFLD than weight gain in late adulthood. 212 NAFLD is also becoming an important cause of liver disease-related mortality in Pakistan. NAFLD and other causes accounted for 21\u00b76% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, and for 11\u00b78% of all deaths due to liver cancer, according to GHE 2015 data (table 2). 1 Increasing incidence of obesity and metabolic syndrome could lead to high burden of NASH that causes cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Data on NAFLD from Pakistan are scarce. The prevalence of NAFLD has been reported as 9-27% in rural areas and as 21-42% in urban areas, reflecting the impact of industrialisation and urbanisation on lifestyle and disease status. 213 Presence of metabolic syndrome or its individual components were found to be major contributing factors associated with increased prevalence of NAFLD in communities, with most cases being found in women. [214] [215] [216] In a hospitalbased study, 217 the prevalence of NAFLD and the multiplicative effect of combinations of predictive factors associated with NAFLD were studied in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes; NAFLD was found in 71\u00b79% of cases. Additionally, an increasing trend in the odds ratio of having NAFLD was observed as the number or risk factors increased. A combination of physical inactivity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, large waist circumference, high BMI, high HbA 1c , high triglycerides, low HDL, high LDL, and high alanine aminotransferase predicted the highest odds of 10\u00b78 for NAFLD (95% CI 4\u00b79-24; p=0\u00b7001). 217 In a large community-based study of 1225 individuals, NAFLD was found in 741 (60\u00b75%); this proportion was higher in those with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. 217 Considering the increasing burden of type 2 diabetes and other noncommunicable diseases, NAFLD is emerging as a major threat for the health-care system in Pakistan.",

In the GHE 2015 dataset, NAFLD and other causes accounted for 13\u00b72% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, and for 12\u00b72% of those due to liver cancer (table 2). 1 NAFLD is increasing in Bangladesh because of changing dietary patterns and sedentary lifestyles. In a large cross-sectional study done in urban and rural areas of Bangladesh, the prevalence of NAFLD determined by ultrasound was 36\u00b79% (95% CI 33\u00b70-40\u00b73) in rural and 33\u00b70% (31\u00b70-39\u00b79) in urban areas. The prevalence was 71\u00b72% (64\u00b71-77\u00b74) in people with diabetes and 63\u00b76% (59\u00b74-67\u00b75) in obese individuals (BMI \u226527\u00b750 kg/m\u00b2). 218 By comparison, a rural study in Bangladesh showed that the overall prevalence of NAFLD was 18\u00b74% (12\u00b74-25\u00b76). 219 The prevalence of overweight, obesity, and diabetes in Bangladesh has increased in the past three decades, thus increasing the NAFLD-related liver disease burden. Data from the 2011 Bangladesh Demography and Health Survey reported an overall prevalence of 18\u00b79% (95% CI 17\u00b79-19\u00b79) of overweight and 4\u00b76% (4\u00b70-5\u00b72) of obesity; people living in urban areas were more likely to be overweight or obese than those living in rural areas (odds ratio [OR] 1\u00b727, 95% CI 1\u00b705-1\u00b755; p=0\u00b702). 220 There has been a substantial increase in overweight and obesity from the early 1990s when their prevalence was reported to be 4%. 220, 221 The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has increased 2\u00b75 times in Bangladesh, from 4% in 1990 to 10% in 2011. 222 Additionally, a study done in a tertiary care liver clinic estimated the prevalence of biopsy-proven NASH in people with NAFLD to be 42\u00b74%. 223 Liver diseases caused by lifestyle factors have gained importance in Japan as the proportion due to viral hepatitis has decreased. According to the GHE 2015 dataset, NAFLD and other causes accounted for 8\u00b76% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, and for 3\u00b73% of all deaths due to liver cancer (table 2). 1 Case estimates of the total prevalence of NAFLD in 2016 were 22\u00b77 million, with 3\u00b779 million cases of NASH, 0\u00b719 million cases of cirrhosis, and 2200 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma due to NAFLD. 189 In 1992, the prevalence of new cases of non-B, non-C hepatocellular carcinoma was only 6\u00b75%, but in 2010 it increased to 24\u00b71% (appendix p 7). 224 The number of patients who died with non-B, non-C hepatocellular carcinoma increased 5\u00b74 times in 24 years, from 1741 in 1992 to 9389 in 2015.

According to the GHE 2015 (table 2) . 1 The prevalence of obesity in New Zealand has also drastically increased since 1990 (10% in men and 13% in women for that year). 233 The New Zealand Health Survey Results for 2015-16 indicate that almost one in three adults (aged 15 years and older) were obese (32%) and a further 35% of adults were overweight. 234 Healthcare costs attributable to obesity were estimated to be NZ$686 million (4\u00b75% of New Zealand's total health-care expenditure in 2006), or $911 million when lost productivity was included. Data on liver enzymes as indirect indices of NAFLD from a nutritional survey of more than 4721 New Zealanders aged 15 years and older indicated that the prevalence of increased concentrations of alanine aminotransferase and \u03b3-glutamyltransferase was approximately 13% for 2008-09. 235 As with New Zealand, NAFLD is gaining prominence as a cause of liver mortality in Singapore. NAFLD and other causes accounted for 8\u00b73% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases in the GHE 2015 dataset, and for 5\u00b77% of all deaths due to liver cancer (table 2) . 1 There are no formal studies of prevalence of fatty liver disease in Singapore but at a 2012 public health forum, 40% of 227 attendees were diagnosed with a fatty liver. 236 In a study of fatty liver disease in patients undergoing cholecystectomy, the prevalence increased over time in a 10-year period, from 40% to 56\u00b76%. 237 In the Singapore Chinese Health Study, 238 a large prospective cohort study, 63 257 patients were followed up since 1993-98 for an average of 14 years; of them, 499 developed hepatocellular carcinoma. People with diabetes in this study had a hazard ratio of 2\u00b714 (95% CI 1\u00b769-2\u00b771) of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. This effect was independent of markers for viral hepatitis. In the study, a history of diabetes was present in 8\u00b79% of the population at baseline. 238 Data from the Singapore Ministry of Health showed that 11\u00b73% of Singaporeans had diabetes in 2010, representing an increase from 8\u00b72% in 2004. 239 Since diabetes is a major risk factor for fatty liver disease and NASH other than obesity, this increase provides some insight into the potential increase in burden of NAFLD. The Ministry of Health also found that there was an increasing trend of obesity from 6\u00b79% in 2004 to 10\u00b78% in 2010 and 8\u00b76% in 2013. 93 The general lifestyle of Singaporeans involves low physical activity and highcalorie diets, both of which increase the risk of obesity and diabetes, and thus the risk of NAFLD.",

Direct-acting antiviral drugs against HCV, such as simeprevir, asunaprevir, daclatasvir, sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir, elbasvir, and grazoprevir have been approved and are already on the reimbursement lists in some provinces. The public health system of mainland China consists of national and local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and has functioned well in the prevention of viral hepatitis, with current coverage and timely free universal vaccination of infants against HBV exceeding 90%. China has released national action plans for control of viral hepatitis that set clear targets on prevention. However, a specific, large-scale, test-and-treat financed programme for patients with chronic hepatitis B or C is still to be established. Guidelines for prevention and control of hepatitis B and hepatitis C have been published and are regularly updated, with most recommendations in line with the major international guidelines. 246, 247 To facilitate clinical research and evidence-based decision making for clinical practice and public health, a nationwide hospital-based registry for patients with chronic hepatitis B was initiated in 2012, which might prove to be essential to investigate disease burden and long-term outcomes in patients with chronic hepatitis B in a real-world setting. 248 Many aspects of alcohol policy are weaker in China than in its neighbouring countries (table 4) .

However, these strategies have paid seemingly little, if any, attention to diet. The Chinese Government's attempts to tackle obesity are being supported by several large multinational food companies, including the Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, and Nestl\u00e9. 249 These companies fund a non-profit research organisation, the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), originally established in the USA in 1978 by a Coca-Cola executive. For several decades, ILSI-China has led public health initiatives emphasising the importance of exercise and physical activity-rather than nutrition-as key to solving the obesity problem. By focusing more on physical activity than on a healthy diet, attention has been diverted away from highly processed food and calorie-dense snacks and drinks. Dietary policies advocated by the WHO, such as taxing sugary drinks and restricting food advertising to children, are missing. 249 ",

This is one of the most comprehensive hepatitis control programmes globally, on the basis that it incorporates the sequelae of hepatitis infection together with hepatitis infection itself, and intends to reach out to primary health centres in a phased manner. It also features surveillance for acute hepatitis, including hepatitis A and E. Some ongoing related programmes are hepatitis B immunisation for infants, safe blood transfusion, policies on injection safety, safe disposal of biomedical waste, food safety, and, most recently, treatment of hepatitis C. India does not currently have a national alcohol policy, but it has several policies and interventions aimed at reducing the harmful effects of alcohol (table 4). The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment also has reduction and prevention policies on alcohol and drugs. Alcohol is a subject in the State List under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, which defines the exclusive legislative powers of state governments. Therefore, the laws governing alcohol, such as the legal drinking age in India and the laws that regulate its sale and consumption, vary from state to state. In India, consumption of alcohol is prohibited in the states of Bihar Gujarat, and Nagaland, as well as the union territory of Lakshadweep. There is a partial ban on alcohol in some districts of Manipur. All other Indian states permit alcohol consumption but have various legal drinking ages.

In India, no specific laws or guidelines regulate the advertising or marketing of junk foods, but provisions under laws in other policy areas and some guidelines issued by the self-governing Advertising Standards Council of India could be used to regulate their advertising. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has also produced the Guidelines-Code of Self-Regulation in Food Advertisement to control the objectivity and accuracy of food advertisements. 256 However, all of these measures are recommendations rather than mandatory. 257 Amendments regarding packaging and labelling of food under part VII of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules of 1955 mandate the disclosure of health claims alongside nutritional labeling. 258 However, stricter policies are required to prevent misleading information.

Its GDP per capita, however, ranks below the world average, making Indonesia a lower-middle-income country with a GNI per capita of $3440 and PPP per capita of $10 680 in 2015. 260 In 2015, Indonesia spent 3\u00b76% of its GDP on healthcare, which is less than its neighbouring countries such as Singapore (5\u00b78%), Malaysia (4\u00b73%), and Thailand (4\u00b72%). 260 This expenditure covered 40% of the country's total health-care costs, whereas the remaining 60% were covered by private firms or out-of-pocket expenses, but by 2020 it is expected that public and private expenditure will contribute equally. 244 A serious effort to address hepatitis infection began in 1991 with a WHO-sponsored neonatal hepatitis B vaccination project in Lombok. In 1992, the Indonesian Red Cross started programmes for safe blood. These efforts-and more recent active harm reduction measures from 2010-were considered to support the decreasing incidence of HBV and HCV. 261 In 1997, hepatitis B immunisation for infants was launched as a national programme and upscaled in 1999 by the introduction of birth-dose vaccination. 262 A Hepatitis Control Program within the Ministry of Health was launched in 2012. 263 The Indonesian Government issued a decree on the National Control of Viral Hepatitis in 2015, supported by a national budget, 263 followed by a decree in 2017 for the Triple Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV, Syphilis, and Hepatitis B by integrating HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B antenatal screening, prevention, and treatment interventions into Mother-and-Child Health Care services. 264 A government assistance programme began in 2017 that provides free testing and direct-acting antiviral drugs for 6000 patients with chronic hepatitis C infection who cannot afford diagnosis and treatment. 36 Meanwhile, efforts are made to include these drugs in the Essential Medical List to be used through the public health-care insurance system. Sofosbuvir, simeprevir, daclastavir, and one fixedcombination (elbasvir-grazoprevir) drug are the currently registered direct-acting antivirals in Indonesia.",

These policies need to be updated with resultoriented strategies that aim to improve accountability and effectiveness by clearly defining expected outcomes, facilitating monitoring and evaluation, and reflecting improvements resulting from performance assessment processes. For example, in 1997, Pakistan introduced a National Health Policy targeting non-communicable diseases, and in 2003, it introduced an integrated national plan for action on four major non-communicable diseases and their risk factors, injuries, and mental health. Both the Policy and plan could not be implemented properly because of a change in government. 269 In Pakistan, vaccination against HBV was incorporated into WHO's Expanded Programme on Immunisation in 2002, providing the first vaccine dose at the age of 6 weeks; however, coverage for all three doses has reached 75% according to WHO-UNICEF estimates in 2018. 270 National guidelines on treatment and surveillance, provision of screening kits, injection safety equipment, training for preventive measures, and campaigns to increase mass awareness and financial support for treatment have also been developed. 271 The National Programme for Hepatitis Prevention and Control was launched in 2005, after which provincial implementation units were also set up. 272 The Programme focused on screening and treatment for HCV infection and did not establish laboratory-based viral hepatitis surveillance. At the time, hepatitis surveillance in Pakistan was syndromic, not providing laboratory confirmation of infection or information on the type of virus, and not collecting information on risk factors. In 2009, to monitor the effectiveness of the Programme's activities and guide the implementation of evidence-based preventative interventions, the Pakistan Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (under the akistani Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the Ministry of Health) launched a hepatitis sentinel-site surveillance system (appendix p 3). The sites were located in five public tertiary care hospitals in four provincial headquarters (Lahore, Peshawar, Karachi, and Quetta) and in Islamabad. To engage Sindh province to implement strategies, the United States Agency for International Development further supported the Pakistani Centres for Disease Control and Prevention toward expansion of the surveillance sites. 273, 274 A National Hepatitis Strategic Framework for viral hepatitis (2017-21) 274, 275 has been launched to eliminate viral hepatitis C by 2030, reduce hepatitis B and C by 10% reduction by 2021, and reduce new cases of hepatitis B, C, and D by 30% by 2021. So far, the measures implemented by the Government of Pakistan include HBV vaccination for children and adults and providing antiviral therapy for patients with HBV and HCV through various programmes and public awareness campaigns. The national essential medicines list, subsidised by the government, includes antiviral therapy for HBV (interferon alpha, pegylated interferon, entecavir, tenofovir, and lamuvidine) and HCV (interferon alpha, pegylated interferon, ribavirin, sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, and velpatsavir).",

However, eliminating HBV remains a challenge because of factors such as an increase in HBeAg-negative infections, lack of adequate numbers of hepatologists, insufficient availability of laboratory facilities for viral load estimation, social taboos, lack of public awareness about hepatitis B and its preventability, and misconceptions about the mode of transmission and consequences of HBV infection.

            "text": "The Bangladesh National Plan for Action on Nutrition was started in 1997, 283 with a focus on targeting undernutrition (table 5) . Dietary guidelines for Bangladesh were introduced in 2013 that describe population goals for intake of various nutrients, including saturated fats, trans fats, and sugars, which represent the average nutrient intake needed to maintain a healthy population. Bangladesh also endorsed a second National Plan of Action for Nutrition for 2016-25 in March, 2017. 284 Its goal is to improve the nutritional status of all citizens and reduce all forms of malnutrition, with a focus on children, adolescent girls, and pregnant and lactating women. The only strategies that discuss overnutrition in depth as a development challenge are the National Urban Health Strategy 2011 285 and the Strategic Plan for Surveillance and Prevention of Non-Communicable Diseases in Bangladesh 2011-15. 286 The Health, Nutrition, and Population Sector Program, 287 which began in 2011, also recognises overnutrition and obesity as development challenges. The programme is particularly focused at early intervention to address obesity and its risk factors, but trains front-line fieldworkers on prevention of all risk factors related to non-communicable diseases. 288 According to the World Bank's income classification, Japan is a high-income country with GNI per capita of $43 630 in PPP terms in 2016. Japan's health-care system is largely successful because of its wide availability, effectiveness, and efficiency. 289 The Japanese population has the longest life expectancy of all members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 290 and its health-care expenditure as a share of GDP is lower than most of the developed OECD countries. In 2013, health expenditure in Japan was 10\u00b73% of GDP, compared with an OECD average of 8\u00b79%. 291 Health insurance is mandatory in principle, but there is no penalty for the 10% of individuals who evade the compulsory insurance premium contribution, making it optional in practice. 292 Health insurance can be either national or provided by the employer. In 1958, a new citizens' health insurance law formally committed Japan to universal health coverage by making enrolment in governmental insurance systems mandatory for people not covered by employee-based plans, and by 1961 all municipalities had established insurance programmes with near-complete coverage. 52 The Japanese Government has been providing free hepatitis testing since 2002 for all citizens aged 40-70 years as part of routine health examinations. In 2007, patient management was strengthened by the establishment of a community hepatitis care network that links primary care physicians with specialised regional centres to co-manage patients with liver disease. Treatment for hepatitis was expensive, so the Government introduced a subsidy programme in 2008 to reduce the burden of out-of-pocket expenses. 293 The cost of subsidies is borne by the national and local governments. People living with hepatitis currently pay \u00a510 000-20 000 (approximately $ per month on the basis of their income to cover the cost of drugs, medical appointments, and laboratory tests.",

Infants who were born to HBsAg-positive mothers began receiving HBV vaccination plus IgG therapy in 1986. Further, the Japanese Red Cross implemented nucleic acid screening programmes for HBV and HCV in 1999. These national efforts markedly reduced the prevalence of childhood HBV infections. Nevertheless, about 200 new, primarily adult infections of acute HBV are reported annually. 48 The distribution of HBV genotypes also appears to have changed on the basis of an observed increase of chronic infections but without obvious household transmission, which makes controlling infection challenging. 294 The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare implemented routine immunisation of children for HBV in 2016 to prevent horizontal HBV transmission and to eradicate infection incidence, in line with WHO's target of eliminating the public health threat of viral hepatitis by 2030. 294 Because of the universal health insurance system and the subsidy programme, the economic barrier to HCV eradication is very low in Japan, with all patients with HCV having access to direct-acting antiviral drugs (sofosbufir, sofosbufir-ledipasvir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir-ritonavir, daclatasvir, elbasvir-grazoprevir, and sofosbufir-velpatasvir).

As discussed, deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma plateaued in 2002-04 and have declined since. Access to medical examinations is easy, so patients with high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma can be regularly monitored and many cases are treatable because they are detected at an early stage. The production and off-premise sale of all alcoholic beverages based on the Liquor Tax Law requires a Government licence (table 4 ). This licensing system has been strictly imposed over time and almost no homebrewed alcohol has been available on the market for the past 30 years. However, there is virtually no restriction on off-premise sales in Japan and there are no restrictions on the advertising alcoholic beverages. Encouraging weight loss is a central aim of Healthy Japan 21, a series of 10-year public-health goals devised at the start of the millennium (table 5) . 297 This reduction of overweight is to be achieved through public education campaigns on healthy eating and increased physical activity. 298 Japan's school lunches programme has helped to slow the rise of child obesity in Japan. Lunches tend to be planned by a nutritionist, include locally grown and fresh ingredients, and tend to be dominated by rice, vegetables, soups, and fish. Childhood obesity has increased in Japan since the 1970s, but that increase has happened more slowly than in other economically developed countries. The Government has established healthy waistline thresholds for adults aged 40-74 years with the metabo law, which came into effect in 2008, and these are measured at annual checkups. 298 The threshold for men is 33\u00b75 inches or less and women, it is 35\u00b74 inches. People who exceed those norms are required to attend counselling and support sessions. Companies are required to measure the waistlines of at least 80% of their employees along with their families, and of retired employees. Furthermore, at the time of introduction, companies were required to help 10% of those who were above the thresholds to lose weight by 2012, and 25% by 2015. Companies and local governments that failed to meet specific targets were liable for financial penalties, potentially as high as $19 million. 298 The targets have not been updated, but companies are now required to increase their contributions to their welfare fund by 10% if they do not perform well. Men and women who exceed the waistline measurement threshold during their annual medical examinations are enrolled in diet programmes, fitness classes, or are asked to see a doctor. The long-term effectiveness of this controversial stringent approach are yet to be clarified. 299 South Korea is a high-income country with nominal GNI per capita of $28 380 and annual GDP growth of 3\u00b71%. 2 By contrast with most OECD countries, health spending in South Korea has been growing continuously since the 1970s at a rate above the OECD average. Total health expenditure as a proportion of GDP was 7\u00b71% in 2014. 300 Although the public sector is the main source of health funding in nearly all OECD countries, the private sector has a much more important role in South Korea and only 56% of health spending was funded by public sources in 2013, well below the average of 73% in OECD countries. 300 Out-of-pocket spending is also an important component of overall health expenditure in South Korea. At 37% of health spending, its share is almost twice the overall OECD average (19\u00b75%). 300 South Korea achieved universal health coverage in 1989. The national health insurance covers about 97% of the population, and the remaining 3% are covered by the Medical Aid Program, a tax-funded programme for health-care access of citizens with low incomes. By contrast with public health financing, health-care delivery relies heavily on the private sector, although some public health facilities provide medical services at the central, regional, and municipal levels. As of 2012, almost all clinics and about 94% of hospitals were privately owned. 301 For hepatitis B in South Korea, the use of oral antiviral drugs is done according to the reimbursement guidelines of the national health insurance programme. Pegylated interferon can also be used. For HCV, the use of pegylated interferon and ribavirin has been covered by the national health insurance programme. Coverage is not complete for direct-acting antiviral drugs but is improving and the following drugs have been approved by the South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety for the treatment of HCV: sofosbuvir-ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, asunaprevir, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir, elbasvirgrazoprevir, and glecaprevir-pibrentasvir.",

            "text": "Health care in Australia is delivered as a mixed system via universal health care (public), which predominates, and private providers (insurance), who make a small contribution. Australia's universal health care is primarily funded by Medicare, a financing system that covers most costs of health services, including those in public hospitals. Medicare is funded partly by a 2% Medicare income levy (with exceptions for people with low incomes), with any shortfall being met by the Government from its general revenue. 304 The proportion of Australia's health expenditure of GDP (9\u00b75%) for 2011-12 was slightly above average compared with other OECD countries. 305 In Australia, a universal hepatitis B vaccination programme for all infants was introduced in 2000. 306 It was preceded by various programmes implemented in the late 1980s that targeted individuals at increased risk of HBV infection. Catch-up vaccination programmes against hepatitis B for adolescents have been implemented at different times, settings, and jurisdictions since 1997. 71 However, health inequity between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians regarding HBV infection is still substantial. Vaccination coverage of Indigenous Australian adults needs to be increased through a state-funded vaccination catch-up programme. In 2017, an estimated 149 746 people living with chronic hepatitis B in Australia had been diagnosed, representing 68% of the total estimated population living with chronic hepatitis B and a modest increase from the 63% estimate in 2011. 307 The first National Hepatitis B Strategy 2010-13 308 sought to reduce disease transmission and the morbidity and mortality associated with hepatitis B. Furthermore, the introduction of highly effective HBV antiviral therapy in Australia with entecavir in 2005 and tenofovir in 2007 was accompanied by considerable increases in treatment uptake. During 2017, 19 358 people were administered drugs for hepatitis B, representing 8\u00b77% of those estimated to be living with chronic hepatitis B. Modeled trends between 2011 and 2017 show an ongoing modest increase (average 0\u00b793% per year) in this proportion. 307 At the population-level, only a few people with chronic HBV infections (possibly 10-15%) would be recommended for treatment on the basis of national and international consensus guidelines. 309, 310 These vaccination efforts are collectively reflected in the fact that Australia was recognised by WHO as meeting the regional control target of hepatitis B, which is a prevalence of less than 1% in children younger than 5 years. 311 Australia implemented its Third National Hepatitis B Strategy for 2018-22 to achieve and maintain 95% vaccination coverage against hepatitis B in infants, increase the proportion of diagnosed people with chronic hepatitis B infection to 80%, increase the proportion of those receiving care to 50% and those receiving antiviral treatment to 20%, and reduce mortality related to chronic hepatitis B by 30%. 312 Estimates from modelling studies indicate that 75-85% of Australians with HCV are diagnosed, one of the highest proportions of diagnosed individuals globally. 313 Despite this estimate, treatment uptake was low (2000-4000 people per year, or 1-2% of the infected population) in the era of interferon-based regimens. 313 However, uptake has substantially increased following the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which, since March 1, 2016, has listed interferon-free, all-oral regimens of direct-acting antiviral drugs with no restrictions on the basis of the stage of liver disease or drug and alcohol intake. 314 4400 incident patients were treated per month during the first four months of listing. 315 By December, 2017, the number of patients starting therapy with direct-acting antiviral drugs had stabilised to about 1280 patients per month. 315 Over the first 2 years of listing, 2016-18, 56 356 patients had been supplied with medication, and as of April 30, 2018, this number of patients was 58 941. 315 The Australian Government has allocated $0\u00b76 billion to fund this scheme over the subsequent 5 years. This treatment increase suggests that Australia could eliminate hepatitis C within the next 10-15 years if the current trend continues. 316 The 2009 Australian Guidelines to Reduce Health Risks from Drinking Alcohol have led to some recommendations on reducing alcohol-related liver harms and on broader health aspects (table 4) . 317 Subsequent estimates suggest that Australians were drinking less alcohol in 2013-14 than in 1960, 50 years earlier. 318 In 2014-15, 65\u00b73% of Australians aged at least 15 years had sedentary lives or exercised rarely. This proportion comprises 33\u00b78% sedentary people and 31\u00b75% people with low levels of exercise below the \"sufficiently active\" threshold, defined as at least 30 min of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, preferably all, days. 319 During the past two decades, frequent campaigns run by Federal and State agencies in Australia to promote healthy food intake and physical activity have been successful on the basis of improved general awareness about obesity, increased physical activity, and modification of dietary patterns (table 5) . 320, 321 New Zealand's Government is applying a nationwide wellbeing approach to policy and budget decision",

This Act introduced a limit on alcohol vending hours, strengthened restrictions around irresponsible promotion of alcohol, and stricter laws on the supply of alcohol. It also increased the ability of communities to control alcohol licensing in their local area, run national social marketing campaigns to raise awareness about alcohol harms, expand school-based health services to improve early identification and treatment referrals for young people with an alcohol problem, provide self-help tools such as the Alcohol Drug Helpline, and support people to address their alcohol issues through primary care and specialist services. 325 A Childhood Obesity Plan was launched in New Zealand in October, 2015, with three focus areas comprising 22 initiatives (table 5) . 326 These initiatives either expanded on already existing recommendations or were new, such as targeted interventions for obese individuals, increased support for people at risk of becoming obese, and broad approaches to make healthier choices easier for all New Zealanders. The focus of the plan is on food, the environment, and physical activity at each life stage, starting from pregnancy. The plan brings together initiatives across government agencies, the private sector, communities, schools, families, and wh\u0101nau (M\u0101ori for extended family or community co-inhabiting an area as an economic unit). There have been many initiatives that encourage healthy eating, physical activity, and adequate sleep, such as Eating and Activity Guidelines for New Zealand Adults, 327 Physical Activity guidelines, 328 Clinical Guidelines for Weight Management for Adults, 329 Clinical Guidelines for Weight Management for Children and Young People, 330 Fruit in Schools, 331 Green Prescriptions, 332 and Active Families. 333 The Fruit in Schools programme provides a piece of fruit each day to children from communities with low socioeconomic status. The Green Prescriptions initiative provides individual support for increased physical activity after a referral from a general practitioner or a practice. The Active Families initiative comprises community-based health initiatives designed to increase physical activity and improve nutrition in children and young people aged 5-18 years and in their wh\u0101nau. 325 The World Bank classifies Singapore as a high-income country, with GNI per capita of $85 050 in PPP terms in 2016. Singapore was ranked as the world's most competitive economy, according to the International Institute for Management Development's World Competitiveness Rankings for 2019.",

Patients receive drug subsidies and assistance on the basis of their subsidy and means-test status and the scheme under which the drug is covered (ie, standard drug list vs Medication Assistance Fund). For patients with chronic hepatitis B, adefovir and lamivudine are the only drugs listed under the standard drug list. Entecavir and tenofovir are listed under the Medication Assistance Fund.

In the late 1980s, the programme was extended to preschool children, medical personnel, and elementary-school children, and from 1992 onward, unvaccinated teenagers and adults have been encouraged to be vaccinated on a fee-for-service basis. Around 2000, because of the availability of effective treatments for hepatitis B and C, treatment of chronic viral hepatitis was added to the programme.

From 2012 onward, several medical centres in Pakistan have attempted to develop programmes for transplantation from living donors. 357 The most important impeding factor in developing high-volume transplantation programmes across Pakistan is the lack of skilled workforce. Shifa International Hospital (Islamabad) and the Shaikh Zayed Center of Liver Transplantation (Lahore) are the only two transplantation centres run by local teams, whereas others rely exclusively on international collaborators. Security concerns and visa delays make frequent travel by international teams difficult, and the reliance on international experts interrupts continuity of care. Thus, the presence of efficient local transplant teams is crucial to develop successful and sustainable transplantation programmes. Until February, 2017, only 539 liver transplantations had been done in Pakistan, and approximately 95% of these were done in the two locally run centres.

From 2007 to 2016, 261 liver transplantations were done, 375 105 from living donors and 156 from deceased donors. In 1987, Singapore introduced a presumed consent law for organ donation, referred to as the Human Organ Transplant Act. 376 It applied only to people aged 21-60 years who had died from unnatural causes, met the criteria of brain or cardiac death, were not Muslim, and had not formally dissented from organ donation. Implementation began in 1988 and applied only to kidney donation. A 2004 amendment to the Act also permitted living organ donation and included other organs, such as livers, hearts, and corneas. The 2004 amendment further included all causes of death rather than solely death by accidental causes. Further legislative amendments in 2007 and 2009 were made with the firm intent of expanding the supply of transplantable organs and ensuring that organ donors are not exploited, unlawfully induced, or forced into organ retrieval by nongovernment actors. 377 Another scheme is the Medical Therapy, Education, and Research, 378 which operates on an opt-in basis, allowing people to pledge their organs or body parts for transplantation, education, or research after death. Additionally, the Ministry of Health subsidises at least 50% of the cost of liver transplantations.

The Insurance's outcomes of organ transplantation to ensure public awareness and transparency were also regularly published. 380 There were 24 centres approved by the Taiwanese Ministry of Health and Welfare that did 3017 liver transplantations between 2003 and 2012, with 3-year overall survival of 82%. 380 In summary, inexperienced health-care workers (doctors, nurses, and technicians) and inadequate infrastructure to care for patients with liver diseases (at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels) is a problem in the Asia-Pacific, especially in countries with middle and high HDIs. There is very little information on the number of liver specialists in each country, which might represent a lack of focus on liver diseases and a paucity of hepatology specialists. Hepatology programmes urgently need to be established in most countries in the region. Few liver transplantation facilities are available in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. Even in countries with good facilities, liver transplants from deceased donors represent only a small proportion of all liver transplants.

In 2011, the average total health expenditure per capita for urban areas was three times higher than it was for rural areas (\u00a52698 vs \u00a5879) but the share of out-of-pocket expenditure was 50% for urban residents and 36% for rural residents. 381 Major disparities between the rural and urban health-care systems persist, mainly because of insufficient government stewardship and unequally distributed social determinants of health. The Chinese Government is moving the health-care system towards universal coverage for both rural and urban residents. The New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme is the major medical insurance scheme in rural China. It aims to protect households from falling into poverty because of high treatment costs (ie, catastrophic health expenditure), and its principal objective is to provide universal coverage and improve equity of access to health care. 382, 383 However, the main goal of preventing rural residents from falling into poverty because of severe illness is still far off. With the vast expansion of coverage between 2004 and 2007, reimbursement is falling as medical expenditure is increasing. In 2007, the real reimburse ment rate (reimburse ment amount divided by total expenditure on medical care) was around 19% for illnesses that required expenditures between \u00a5200 and \u00a52000, but only 8% if expenditure was more than \u00a510 000. 384 The distribution of health workers is also uneven between rural and urban areas of China, with two-thirds of the health-care workforce situated in urban areas.

The rural Indian population (about 70% of the total population) has mostly low literacy, lacks basic sanitary facilities, and is thus at high risk of faecal-oral transmission of hepatitis. Hygiene is also poor in urban areas, with poor disposal of solid and liquid waste (including excreta) and poor drainage systems. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (or Clean India Mission) is a nationwide campaign launched in 2014 for clean streets, roads, and other infrastructure. The campaign's objectives include eliminating open defecation through the construction of household-owned and community-owned toilets and establishing an accountability mechanism to monitor toilet use (ie, through a dedicated workforce using mobile phones and tablets). According to the Government of India, which runs the mission, 99% of rural villages were free from open defecation as of Oct 2, 2019. 392, 393 Birth-dose immunisation against hepatitis B in India is low. Blood safety is a challenge in India because of the high prevalence of HIV, HCV, and HBV, the relatively low proportion of volunteer donors, and unstandardised screening procedures across blood collection centres. 394 One study has estimated that nucleic-acid amplification testing could prevent 3272 infectious donations a year (including 818 HIV, 409 HCV, and 2454 HBV) from the approximate 5 million annual donations. 395 Centralised screening centres for nucleic-acid amplification testing that serve all blood banks in a given city and report results electronically are hugely successful globally. This model has worked very well in Thailand, which has a fragmented blood-banking system similar to India and other countries in the region.",

The hepatitis A vaccination strategy in susceptible high-income population groups would need to be reassessed. Introducing a hepatitis A vaccine in resourcepoor populations is problematic because the resulting reduction in HAV transmission can have unintended consequences. Although it might reduce the risk of HAV infection, it also has the potential to increase the average age at which HAV infection occurs, 401 thereby increasing the overall risk of acute disease. Thus, introducing vaccination with low coverage in a high-endemicity area would change the epidemiology to an intermediateendemicity pattern, which is undesirable. By contrast, high-coverage vaccination in an intermediate-endemicity area would result in the desirable outcome of low endemicity.",

The principal barrier to expanding patient coverage is that refugees and asylum seekers living with chronic hepatitis B have many other priorities, such as reuniting with their families and establishing a life in Australia and New Zealand, that are more important to them than health-seeking behaviours. 396 Multiple other challenges include language and cultural differences and little disease-specific knowledge. 413 Australia and New Zealand have low population densities, vast stretches of uninhabited land, and several urban centres distributed sparsely along the coast. The countries have problems addressing the health-care needs of remote communities, where the proportion of Indigenous people is high and geographical distances are extremely large. 414 Inequalities in the social determinants of health between metropolitan and rural and regional populations influence the need for health care. 415 Access to comprehensive primary health care involving specialists is considered ideal for the early and ongoing management of illness in rural areas. 416 However, only 15% of Australian specialists have their main practice outside metropolitan areas, whereas 30% of Australians reside in rural areas. 417 Rural specialist outreach services could help to overcome complex barriers to service access, mainly due to language and cultural differences, and avoid the cost and effort of seeking care away from home. 418 Visiting liver specialists can meet many of the health service needs of rural areas (including prevention and management of liver diseases). Additionally, visiting specialists can also provide periodic procedural support for rural generalists, thereby increasing the clinical confidence and reducing the professional isolation of rural practices. 419 Australia is the only country that, since 2000, has had a sustained national outreach policy that subsidises the outreach of medical specialists to rural areas; still, there is scope to improve outreach in hepatology services. 420 There is also insufficient knowledge among health professionals of risk factors for the presence and progression of liver disease and the effect of liver disease on health and life expectancy. Waiting times for specialised liver centres are long, so patients cannot access services in a timely manner. The inability of primary care physicians to provide effective guidance and the lack of a management toolbox for primary care might also lead to their reduced interest in early intervention.",

Barriers to follow-up include insufficient reminders to patients, lack of physician time, cost of tests and treatment, and blood taking. In a study of patients with chronic hepatitis B who were offered health screening in 2003, 67% were not found to be followed up regularly. 423 In a follow-up study, the barriers to regular follow-up included lack of education of the patient on the implications of not being followed up, cost of follow-up, blood taking, and lack of time. 424 Regarding the management of non-viral hepatitis liver disease in Singapore, a strategy to target high-risk groups, particularly those with diabetes and those who are obese, would be the first step. Lifestyle interventions can be challenging to implement but much can be done by the Government to maximise disease control by introducing health-promoting public policies, infrastrucutre changes to facilitate healthy choices for living, working, studying, and recreation, and collaborative public-private partnerships.

Several other areas can leverage existing mechanisms that support other disease responses, notably HIV, to improve access to care and treatment for patients with viral hepatitis. 4 We believe that governments should be increasingly accountable and take timely measures toward national viral hepatitis elimination strategies. Adequate enforcement of policies is also needed. Funding bodies should ask for evidence of the outcomes of their investments to improve accountability.

The Asia-Pacific region experiences a greater challenge from HBV and HCV infection than any other global region, having half of the 20 most heavily burdened countries. 427 Countries in the Asia-Pacific with a high burden of viral hepatitis span the economic spectrum and there is a negative correlation between GNI and the prevalence of both HBV and HCV, with a greater burden in low-income countries. 4 Countries need to define target screening populations, improve awareness among health-care workers regarding treatment options, subsidise the costs of drugs, and enhance access to them.

Commensurate with an increase in mean incomes, per-capita alcohol consumption has increased in countries of the Asia-Pacific, such as China and India, which will increase their burden of alcohol-related liver disease. Overall, 65% of deaths due to alcohol-related cirrhosis occur in medium-HDI countries and 80% of deaths due to alcohol-related liver cancer occur in high-HDI countries (figure 8, 9) . A systematic review 182 reported that DALYs attributable to alcohol use have increased by more than 25% over 1990-2016 globally, driven primarily by increased consumption in south, southeast, and central Asia, in both men and women. The largest increases in exposure have been in countries in the low-middle quintile of the SDI. 182 In 2016, alcohol use accounted for 4\u00b70% (3\u00b74-4\u00b76) of age-standardised DALYs in southeast Asia. 182 Unlike tobacco or drugs, governments have been discouraged from efforts to limit the availability of alcohol by trade agreements and disputes. Alcohol use is ranked as one of the leading risk factors, surpassing cholesterol, for total DALYs globally since 2010 compared with previous iterations of the GBD Study. 182 The increasing burden of alcohol-related liver diseases can be ameliorated through government policies to control consumption and promote less harmful patterns of alcohol use (table 4) . Alcohol policies can exist at the global, regional, international, national, or subnational levels. Effective alcohol strategies incorporate a multilevel, multicomponent approach, targeting multiple determinants of drinking and alcohol-related harms, such as availability, price, marketing, and criminalisation of drink-driving. We believe that these policies must be well implemented, enforced, and evaluated to be effective. We recommend that countries should develop their own capacities and set up national monitoring systems to complement national surveys and provide crucial information that allows them to evaluate alcohol policies and track alcohol consumption trends over time. Mongolia is a good example, where the President initiated the Alcohol Free Mongolia programme by advocating drinking a glass of milk instead of alcohol. 431 SDG 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages by 2030, and SDG 3.5 calls for strengthening the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug use and harmful alcohol consumption. Although it is difficult to control alcohol use, several countries have added additional taxes on alcohol.",

The strategy provides guidance for action at all levels, including ten recommended target areas for policy and interventions for national action to reduce the harmful use of alcohol, and the main components for global action to support and complement activities at the country level. 165 Given the magnitude and the complexity of the problem of reducing overall alcohol consumption in communities, concerted global and regional efforts must be in place to support countries and communities to reduce their harmful use of alcohol. International coordination and collaboration can create the necessary synergies and provide increased leverage for states to implement evidence-based measures. Local, national, and international monitoring and surveillance frameworks are needed to track the magnitude and trends of alcohol consumption and related harm, as well as monitor policy responses and analyse trends in alcohol consumption and its related disease burden. Such frameworks would be crucial to strengthen advocacy, adjust policy, and programme responses to the trends in alcohol-related harms and assess the effect of interventions. The ultimate goal of monitoring and surveillance is to provide, in a timely manner, relevant and reliable information to policy makers and decision makers for the effective prioritisation, implementation, and evaluation of policy options and interventions to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. WHO's Global Information System on Alcohol and Health serves that purpose and enables these processes. 165 The UN's 2011 Political Declaration of the High-Level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases mandated the development of a global monitoring framework, including indicators, and a set of voluntary global targets for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. 433 This work yielded one voluntary target related to alcohol use: including at least a 10% relative reduction, as appropriate within the national context, in the harmful use of alcohol by 2025.",

The high frequency of metabolic comorbidities in patients with NAFLD indicates that management of the increasing number of these patients might increase the strain on health systems. Furthermore, many patients with NAFLD develop progressive liver disease, which creates challenges for screening. 240 Various steps need to be taken to promote healthy lifestyles to avoid overweight or obesity by increasing physical activity in schools and offices and regulating the food industry (eg, restricting the marketing of unhealthy foods and sugar-sweetened beverages, increasing taxation on unhealthy foods and beverages, labelling food with nutritional information and health facts, regulating the advertising of unhealthy foods, and promoting healthy foods; table 5).

Actions and interventions against NAFLD need to be urgently incorporated into WHO's Global Action Plan on non-communicable diseases, 435 including public awareness (under Objective 1 of the Plan); screening for NAFLD; using simple, non-invasive biochemical markers to detect fibrosis in patients with NAFLD; early detection and weight management strategies including lifestyle modifications (dietary and physical activity); and interventions to prevent progression of NAFLD to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.",

            "text": "Number of research papers published on liver diseases in local journals per country; proportion of research papers published on liver disease in global journals per country The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology Commission SDG 3.8 aims to achieve universal health coverage, including protection from financial risk, access to goodquality, essential health-care services, and access to safe, effective, good-quality, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all by 2030. SDG 3.9b calls for the provision of access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines, in accordance with the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health, 436 which affirms the right of developing countries to fully use the provisions of the TRIPS agreement to provide access to medicines for all by 2030. To this end, health-financing systems should not only seek to raise sufficient funds for health provision but should also do so in a way that allows people to use services without risk of severe financial hardship or impoverishment. 437 Three interrelated areas could bring health financing closer to universal health coverage: raising funds for health, reducing financial barriers to health-care access through prepayment and subsequent pooling of funds instead of direct out-of-pocket payments, and allocating or using funds in a way that promotes efficiency and equity. Public health systems and public-private partnerships need to be strengthened to face the challenges that an increasing burden of liver diseases could create, and measuring progress is an inherent part of any prevention and treatment strategy. We suggest a set of metrics to monitor the implementation of the various aspects of such a strategy (table 6) . Implementation of the recommendations of this Commission will depend less on technical capabilities and more on leadership and political will. Nevertheless, even when there is strong leadership and political will, the availability of finances, application of funds, and health-system capabilities will determine the magnitude and speed of the response. At the country level, public financing for health (as for any sector) is determined by the fiscal space available to the government. The fiscal space depends on the sources of finance available from improved economic growth that creates favourable macroeconomic conditions, such as revenues generated from new taxation or strengthened tax administration, borrowing from domestic and international sources, reprioritisation of health within the existing government budget, more effective and efficient allocation of available health resources, and innovative domestic and international financing. 438 The high-level Taskforce on Innovative International Financing for Health Systems was set up in 2008. 439 It recommended the creation of a common funding platform to strengthen health systems across the three global-scale innovative financing mechanisms-ie, the Global Fund, Gavi, and the World Bank. These innovative financing mechanisms link different elements of the financing value chain to mobilise funding from multiple sources (eg, governments, foundations, and the private sector), pool finances, and channel and allocate funds to health programmes through organisations and governments in low-income and middle-income countries. Outsourcing of services, such as diagnostic tests or management systems for health-care data, to non-government providers and encouraging the use of advanced market commitments (eg, vaccine purchases) can also be used to secure investment in health-care services from the private sector. 439 The opportunity to link revenue generation to a global redistributive and environmental agenda should be sought via taxes on carbon, luxury items, or capital flow, and leveraging an increased domestic return on the natural resources and primary commodities of poor countries. 440 Other financing mechanisms including global health bonds, debt-conversion instruments, market commitment instruments, social and development impact bonds, and global solidarity taxes and levies need to be invoked. Opportunity can be seized in the current political momentum within the G20 countries that is in favour of increased levies on currency transactions and additional financial transaction taxes that could be used to regulate the global financial system. 440 The agenda of expanding the domestic resource base of low-income countries is also important for generating finances for health-care programmes. Many low-income countries could increase domestic public finance by reducing capital flight, promoting more effective tax policy, and improving their tax collection systems. Such an agenda would have the added benefit of focusing attention on the broad challenges of economic development and improving democratic and accountable governance. High-income countries should adhere to their responsibility to allocate 0\u00b77% of their GNI to development aid. Principles and mechanisms need to be established for a systematic transfer of resources from high-income to low-income countries. 440 There are some limitations to our analysis. First is the paucity and patchiness of data on liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region. We did not include any countries with low HDI and thus our analysis is not wholly representative. Second, the tools for collecting, analysing, and reporting data in different countries are not homogenous. Therefore, it is possible that there are additional demands and concerns about staffing and financing needs and the requirements and timelines to reduce the burden of liver diseases. Despite these limitations, the Commission defines the unmet gaps and lays the foundation for collective thinking to eliminate viral hepatitis and control other liver disaeses, including NAFLD and alcohol-related disease, in the countries of the Asia-Pacific region.",
