            "text": "Molecular bioforensic research is dependent on rapid and sensitive methods such as real-time PCR (qPCR) for the identification of microorganisms. The use of synthetic positive control templates containing small modifications outside the primer and probe regions is essential to ensure all aspects of the assay are functioning properly, including the primers and probes. However, a typical qPCR or reverse transcriptase qPCR (qRT-PCR) assay is limited in differentiating products generated from positive controls and biological samples because the fluorescent probe signals generated from each type of amplicon are indistinguishable. Additional methods used to differentiate amplicons, including melt curves, secondary probes, and amplicon sequencing, require significant time to implement and validate and present technical challenges that limit their use for microbial forensic applications. To solve this problem, we have developed a novel application of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to rapidly differentiate qPCR amplicons generated with positive biological samples from those generated with synthetic positive controls. The method has sensitivity equivalent to qPCR and supports the confident and timely determination of the presence of a biothreat agent that is crucial for policymakers and law enforcement. Additionally, it eliminates the need for time-consuming methods to confirm qPCR results, including development and validation of secondary probes or sequencing of small amplicons. In this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with microbial forensic qPCR assays targeting multiple biodefense agents (bacterial, viral, and toxin) for the ability to rapidly discriminate between a positive control and a positive sample.",

            "text": "The use of either of these techniques for microbial forensic analyses requires significant effort to prevent sample contamination and requires the inclusion of positive and negative controls to provide confidence in the accuracy of a given result. The use of positive controls is essential to ensure the target of interest will be detected each time the assay is performed, although it adds the risk of carryover contamination to the test sample. Synthetic templates are a typical choice for positive controls and are usually constructed to contain a small insert or deletion in a region outside the primer or probe binding regions of the target sequence. 4 These types of positive controls are indistinguishable from positive samples based solely on the threshold cycle (Ct) values obtained from a typical qPCR reaction. Therefore, any sample contamination with the positive control would result in a false positive detection in a negative sample by qPCR unless additional methods are used to distinguish between them. Previously available methods for differentiating true biological positive results from contamination events include dual probe assays, amplicon sequencing, and melt curves. Dual probe assays are complicated by the use of unnecessary additional probes that may not detect with the same sensitivity or specificity and require separate validation studies. Amplicon sequencing requires extensive molecular manipulations that are difficult in biocontainment, and it is technically challenging for small amplicons less than 200 base pairs. Melt curve analysis requiring amplicon detection with a saturation dye is incompatible with the validated probe-based qPCR detections discussed in this study.",

            "text": "PCR followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) provides a fast alternative for amplicon interrogation and is amenable to forensic applications. The technology is a rapid, high-throughput method for identifying, characterizing, and quantifying microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. [5] [6] [7] The PCR/ ESI-MS technique identifies microorganisms by determining the precise molecular mass of the individual strands of the PCR products followed by bioinformatic triangulation based on the calculated unambiguous base compositions of those products. Briefly, PCR amplicons are ionized into the gas phase by electrospray-ionization (ESI), which separates the 2 DNA strands, and each strand is then ''weighed'' by the mass spectrometer with enough accuracy to determine the base composition (ie, the number of adenines, guanines, cytosines, and thymines) of the amplicon. While the base composition of the intact amplicon does not convey the order of the bases, it readily distinguishes single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and length variants. Because the products from a test sample and a positive control containing an insertion or deletion will have different molecular masses due to different lengths (and thus different base compositions), this method can be used to address the issue of positive control contamination in test samples. This rapid confirmation of the presence of a biological agent is critical for microbial forensic investigators and for policymakers who are tasked with supporting public safety.",
