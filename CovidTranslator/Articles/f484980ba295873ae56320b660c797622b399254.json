The clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, radiologic presentations, and outcomes of SARS for patients have been well described (3, 9, 12) . Previous reports also found that the specific antibody to SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) appears as early as 9 days after the disease onset and that a high level of antibody could last for 1 to 2 months after the onset of SARS (2, 5, 9) . However, studies concerning the long-term evolution of specific antibodies, including immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM, to SARS-CoV remain limited (14) .

The male-to-female ratio of this group was 7:11. Their ages ranged from 24 to 71 years, with a median age of 45.5 years. No children were included in this study.

All of the serum samples were measured for IgMand IgG-specific antibodies to SARS-CoV using a commercially available indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) (Euroimmune, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) (2, 4) . This test utilizes slides coated with SARS-CoV-infected cells together with noninfected cells to detect specific antibodies in patient serum samples. A reaction with a serum dilution of 1:10 or higher is considered positive (for both IgM and IgG). There is both a negative and a positive control provided by the test kit for each run of the test. The test procedures we used, and our interpretation of the results was according to the manufacturer's instructions.

However, in their study, a tendency toward a continuous drop in the IgG titer was noted until day 240 after disease onset, which raised a question about how long the IgG-specific antibody would actually last. Our study demonstrates that the specific IgG antibody can persist up to 1 year after disease onset. In addition, our data also demonstrate that the drop in the titer of IgG-specific antibody is much slower from 6 to 12 months after disease onset than during the earlier period in the disease course. We think that the strength of our present study is that none of the enrolled patients had underlying diseases before contracting SARS-CoV, which means that their immune responses to SARS-CoV infection are therefore assumed to be more representative of patients with normal immune systems. In addition, to our knowledge, this is the study with the longest follow-up period for antibody responses to SARS-CoV as of this writing. According to our data, IgM to SARS-CoV usually became undetectable 6 months after disease onset, and the titers of IgG became much lower than initial levels (\u03fd1:1,000) 6 months after disease onset. Therefore, a positive IgM result and a high titer of IgG (\u03fe1:1,000) to SARS-CoV might be useful in determining whether a patient has had a recent SARS-CoV infection. Although 17 out of 18 patients received steroids as one component of their treatment for SARS (9), they still exhibited a positive antibody response to SARS-CoV. Our finding that steroid treatment does not interfere with the antibody response to SARS-CoV after infection had also been demonstrated in one previous study (6) .",

Peiris et al. proposed that the exacerbation of clinical conditions in the second week of the disease course in SARS patients correlated with the appearance of immune responses and assumed that the clinical exacerbation might be due to the uncontrolled immune response (8) . However, both the initial and peak CRP levels did not show any significant correlation with the titers of IgG in the present study. This might be because the CRP stood for a nonspecific host response and thus did not necessarily correlate with the host's specific immune response.",

            "text": "There are some limitations in our present study. First, we did not check the neutralizing antibody to SARS-CoV because of the culture for SARS-CoV is restricted for the sake of safety. This is a weak point of this study for our understanding of the whole humoral response to SARS-CoV infection. However, a recent study by Temperton et al. demonstrated that the neutralizing antibody may last up to 250 days after the disease onset (11) . Second, we did not use any antibody test other than IFA, such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, to determine the antibody response and compare the results with those determined by IFA. However, some previous studies have demonstrated that the antibody responses determined by IFA and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were similar (4, 6) . Third, only 29.5% of SARS patients who survived and were treated in our hospital were followed for more than 1 year and enrolled in this study. This is because most surviving SARS patients recovered clinically in 1 to 3 months and did not agree to be followed for such a long time. The antibody response to the SARS-CoV infection in our 18 patients thus might not be representative of the whole spectrum of patients, especially those patients with underlying diseases and/or impaired immune systems.",
