They belong to the family Paramyxoviridae (subfamily Pneumovirinae) and is responsible for acute respiratory tract infections in children, elderly and immunocompromised patients. We designed and tested a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) as a cost-effective alternative to real-time PCR and cell culture based detection for HMPV and HRSV. The newly developed PCR was used to screen nasal/throat swab samples from 356 patients with suspected acute respiratory infection attending the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. The method was compared with a commercially available kit employing real time PCR, for its sensitivity and specificity. 53 (14.9 %) samples were positive for at least one tested pathogen by mRT-PCR. All except one among the positive samples showed similar pathogen profile when tested using real time PCR. 8 (15.1 %) among these 53 were positive for HRSVA, 33 (62.3 %) positive for HRSVB and 12 (22.6 %) were positive for HMPV. 17 (32.7 %) samples showed co-infections in them. Sensitivity and specificity of the mRT-PCR was comparable to that of the commercial kit. Our findings indicate that this newly developed mRT-PCR can be used as a cost-effective alternative for laboratory diagnosis of HMPV/HRSV infection and will significantly reduce diagnostic costs for these viruses in clinical settings.",

However, costs for doing such tests sometimes hinder accurate clinical diagnosis due to the ever increasing number of respiratory viruses with a repertoire of causing clinically indistinguishable disease phenotype. Currently, diagnosis of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) relies on the molecular detection of viral RNA using rRT-PCR and they have overlapping clinical symptoms and are also seen to coinfect [25] . Thus we developed a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) assay for the detection of HMPV/HRSV from clinical specimens as a cost-effective alternative and compared its efficacy with established rRT-PCR. We found the newly developed mRT-PCR to have great potential for use in epidemiological vigilance and clinical diagnosis with comparable specificity and sensitivity to that of rRT-PCR [4, 8, 11, 27] .",

There have been very few studies which have attempted for rapid diagnosis of respiratory viruses using multiplex PCRs [5] . Use of molecular tests in diagnosis of important respiratory viral causative agents such as HRSV/HMPV has gained wide acceptance. The diagnosis of HMPV is even tougher, as the virus is difficult to isolate in cell culture. Considering the necessity of rapid diagnosis for the clinician, virus isolation on cell culture has been replaced by molecular diagnostic tests. rRT-PCR method for reliable diagnosis of HMPV from respiratory secretions is currently the test of choice. Few studies have developed and evaluated multiplex PCR assays with the aim of providing a tool capable of detecting complete panel of known respiratory viruses [16] . HMPV infection acts as an enhancer of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and concurrently patients with COPD are more prone to HMPV infection. Studies to date have also shown a significant correlation between HRSV infection and development of childhood asthma in children experiencing RSV bronchiolitis during the first decade of life as opposed to older children. Clinical data from our study also probably points to the fact that a family history of asthma could be a significant non-modifiable risk factor for HRSV infection (Supplementary 01) [9] .",

Confirmation of HMPV/HRSV etiology by this method gives prompt response in \\24 h, which is important for therapy and critical for avoiding unwanted use of antibiotics. mRT-PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates or swabs can be considered a reliable method to establish the diagnosis of HMPV/HRSV infection from clinical samples. Multiplex platforms that allows concurrent detection of several respiratory viruses have the advantage of providing specific results with a rapid turnaround time, and are becoming increasingly viable for commercial use [5] . Viral co-infection has been described previously in 5-20 % of infected patients in different studies [6, 24] . The mRT PCR method also detected a significant proportion of samples to have co-infections from both viruses (17 of the 53 positive samples). Concordance between both the methods was 100 % for HRSV A and HMPV; and 99.7 % for RSV B. There are contradictory reports on the association between HRSV and HMPV co-infection and disease severity. Some studies have found that co-infection leads to an increased rate of intensive care unit admittance, but others found no association between co-infection and disease severity [19] . However, our patient population were primarily \\6 years children and [50 years adults. Therefore larger studies of chronically ill and elderly patients will be needed before conclusions may be generalized to all patient subgroups.",
