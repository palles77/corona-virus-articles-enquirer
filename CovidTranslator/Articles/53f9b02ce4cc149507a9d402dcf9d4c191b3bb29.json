In this study, the deadly agent of hemorrhagic diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome, Escherichia coli O157:H7 was investigated with extensive computational approaches aimed at identifying novel and broad-spectrum antibiotic targets. A systematic in silico workflow consisting of comparative genomics, metabolic pathways analysis, and additional drug prioritizing parameters was used to identify novel drug targets that were essential for the pathogen's survival but absent in its human host. Comparative genomic analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotated metabolic pathways identified 350 putative target proteins in E. coli O157:H7 which showed no similarity to human proteins. Further bioinformatic approaches including prediction of subcellular localization, calculation of molecular weight, and web-based investigation of 3D structural characteristics greatly aided in filtering the potential drug targets from 350 to 120. Ultimately, 44 non-homologous essential proteins of E. coli O157:H7 were prioritized and proved to have the eligibility to become novel broad-spectrum antibiotic targets and DNA polymerase III alpha (dnaE) was the top-ranked among these targets. Moreover, druggability of each of the identified drug targets was evaluated by the DrugBank database. In addition, 3D structure of the dnaE was modeled and explored further for in silico docking with ligands having potential druggability. Finally, we confirmed that the compounds N-coeleneterazine and N-(1,4-dihydro-5H-tetrazol-5-ylidene)-9-oxo-9H-xanthene-2-sulfonamide were the most suitable ligands of dnaE and hence proposed as the potential inhibitors of this target protein. The results of this study could facilitate the discovery and release of new and effective drugs against E. coli O157:H7 and other deadly human bacterial pathogens.",

            "text": "Drug target identification is the first step in the drug discovery process. 15 However, traditional drug discovery methods are time-consuming, expensive, and often yield few drug targets. In contrast, advances in complete genome sequencing, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics represent an attractive alternative approach to identify drug targets worthy of experimental follow-up. Because of the availability of both pathogen and host-genome sequences, it has become easier to identify drug targets at the genomic level for any given pathogen. 16, 17 In recent years, computational methods have been used widely for the identification of potential drug and vaccine targets in different pathogenic microorganisms. [18] [19] [20] [21] Subtractive and comparative genomics approach combined with metabolic pathway analysis was found to be an efficient way to identify the protein-set essential for the pathogen's survival but absent in the host. 22 Subtraction of the host genome from essential genes of pathogens helps in searching for non-human homologous targets which ensures no interaction of drugs with human targets. On the other hand, comparative genomics method emphasizes the selection of conserved proteins amongst several species as most favorable targets. [23] [24] [25] [26] The use of advanced bioinformatics tools with integrated genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics may ensure the discovery of potential drug targets for most of the infectious diseases. Once the target(s) have been identified, the in silico virtual screening of different chemical databases could provide unprecedented opportunity to select and design the best possible inhibitor(s). 27 In this study, we took an in-depth in silico approach to identify novel therapeutic targets in E. coli O157:H7 Sakai strain by combining analysis of metabolomics and genomics data. Instead of analysis of whole genome, we particularly considered the key essential or survival proteins of the pathogen which are non-homologous to the host. We elucidated a good number of novel targets in E. coli O157:H7 to design effective drugs against broad-spectrum pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, we provided a modeled 3D structure of DNA polymerase III alpha (dnaE) which was selected as the best possible target for inhibition and designing potential drugs. To the best of our knowledge this was the first in silico identification of drug targets in E. coli O157:H7.",

            "text": "To be an effective drug target, the protein should be crucial for the survival of pathogen in the host body but non-homologous to human proteins and this criterion is a prerequisite for avoiding cross binding of drugs with human proteins, and drug side effect probability. 51 Unique pathways are those that are specific to the pathogen but absent in its host. Proteins in these pathways can also be considered as unique to the pathogen and might serve as potential drug and vaccine targets. 34 Moreover, several unique proteins are known to be present in common pathways as identified during our analysis of E. coli O157:H7 (data not shown) and in several previous studies on other bacteria. 19, 20, 52 Additionally, we also identified that a single unique protein can also take part in multiple pathways. Proteins that are involved in more than one pathway could be more effective drug targets when, in addition, they are non-homologous proteins. Nevertheless, being unique or non-human and involved in metabolic pathways are not the sole criteria for selecting favorable drug targets. It is possible that a bacterial protein showing no similarity to host proteins might be involved in multiple metabolic pathways, but its disruption might be of no therapeutic benefit. The reasons may include presence of paralogs, isoenzymes, and most importantly, being nonessential for the pathogen's survival. Again, not all essential proteins are non-homologous in nature. Therefore, pathogen proteins that fulfill the criteria of being unique and essential at the same time represent more attractive drug targets. 34 Based on the criteria discussed above, we identified 780 probable essential proteins from host-pathogen common pathways, and 234 from pathogen unique pathways (Supplementary materials). These proteins showed good similarity with the experimentally proven essential proteins recorded in DEG database. BLASTP search against human proteome narrowed down the target proteome to only 220 and 130 proteins from common pathways and unique pathways respectively resulting in 350 proteins which were essential for the pathogen's survival and non-homologous to the host (Supplementary materials).",

Methanotrophs involved in the global methane cycle consume methane as their sole source of carbon and energy for growing 58 whereas methanogens can obtain energy for growth by converting a limited number of substrates to methane. 59 The protein ilvH, acetolactate synthase III small subunit, is a unique protein present in C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism (KEGG Pathway: map00660) which provides alternative sources of carbon and energy. 60 There was a unique presence of four proteins in nitrogen metabolism (KEEG Pathway: map00910). In the nitrogen cycle, different reductive or oxidative reactions are utilized by prokaryotes for energy conservation. 61 In case of oxygen deprived growth conditions for E. coli, anaerobic respiration nitrate is the preferred electron acceptor. 62 The putative resistance protein was identified as unique protein present in phosphonate and phosphinate metabolism (KEGG Pathway: map00440). Natural products containing carbon-phosphorous bonds, so-called C-P compounds have been found in many organisms, but only protists and bacteria, mostly actinobacteria, have biosynthetic capacity. Moreover, the secB; protein-export protein secB and etpN; type 4 prepilin-like proteins leader peptide-processing enzyme, that are the parts of bacterial secretion system (KEGG Pathway: map03070), were found as unique. Many proteins implicated in efflux of different toxins and drugs; virulence and biogenesis of different organelles (pili and flagella) are secreted. 63 The secB is involved in efficient export of proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane in E. coli. 64 In PTS (KEGG Pathway: map02060), n9 proteins were found to be uniquely present. It has been known that PTS is involved in transportation of more than 20 carbohydrates in bacteria and plays a major role in phosphorylation and uptake of carbohydrates and controlling their metabolism. 65, 66 Flagellar FliJ protein which is part of flagellar assembly (KEGG Pathway: map02040) as well as a putative general chaperone and cytoplasmic protein 67 was identified as unique in the pathogen. The bacterial flagellum extending from the cytoplasm to the cell exterior serves as both a motor organelle and a protein export/assembly apparatus. 68 A total of 19 proteins were identified as unique in the pathogen-specific pathway in a two-component system (KEGG Pathway: map02020). Bacterial two-component system is required for adaptation to external stimuli and can affect changes in cellular physiology. 69 A single protein was identified to be involved in biosynthesis of siderophore group non-ribosomal peptides pathway. Polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal polypeptide synthetases are known to be responsible for the biosynthesis of several siderophores such as enterobactin in E. coli. 70 Two proteins were detected in case of bacterial chemotaxis. In chemotaxis, bacteria sense chemical gradients in the environment and move toward favorable conditions. The pathway is arguably best characterized in the case of E. coli. 71 Novel targets in common host-pathogen pathways",

Inspection of the Psi/Phi Ramachandran plot analysis showed that the model built by ESyPred3D has residues in most favored regions 92.4%, residues in additional allowed regions 7.1%, and residues in generously allowed regions 0.3%. A good quality model would be expected to have over 90% in the most favored regions ( Figure 5A ). This structure was also verified with ANOLEA. The y-axis of the plot represents the energy for each amino acid of the protein chain and it showed that maximum residues are in favorable energy environment ( Figure 5B ). As a result the structure modeled was considered as a good quality model for further analysis. To obtain a better refined model energy minimization was done using Swiss PDB viewer. It minimizes energy using GROMOS96. The force-field energies of the overall structure before and after minimization were -13,816.546 KJ/mol and -36,224.391 KJ/mol respectively.",

The properties of the active site are determined by the sequences of amino acids and the 3D arrangement of the polypeptide chains of the enzyme. Identification of the active site of E. coli O157:H7 Sakai strain dnaE was done by CASTp server. This server calculates the surface area and volume of the pocket of the given structure. In addition, it also shows the active site residues. The active site residues with a volume of 17,116 were shown in Figure 6 . Literature searching helped us to identify the important residues within the pocket. The structure of catalytic alpha subunit of E. coli is known to have three conserved residues of aspartate (Asp 402, Asp 404, and Asp 556 in our model, ensured by aligning with the reference structure, data not shown) and four conserved Virtual screening, drug likeliness, and toxicity analysis dnaE. 84 Information on these molecules' binding interaction was taken as reference to predict convenient inhibitors of dnaE of E. coli O157:H7 Sakai strand from the molecules of DrugBank ( Figure 7A ). The top 100 hits from DrugBank showing lower binding energies after being docked five times were filtered for Lipinski's rule of five 85 that reduced the compounds to 59. To avoid off target binding, the compounds having human targets were excluded. The top two hits showed stable or nearly stable binding energy and good clustering performances from the docking results (Table 3) and structures are shown in Figure 8 . Among the final high affinity binding molecules, DB04118 (N-coeleneterazine) and DB04698 (N-(1,4-dihydro-5H-tetrazol-5-ylidene)-9oxo-9H-xanthene-2-sulfonamide) were found to interact with important residues ( Figure 7B) and DB04698 respectively that are considered middle and low permeability respectively. Both drugs exhibit good oral bioavailability and mostly negative result in Ames test as predicted by FAF-Drugs2 and PreADMET toxicity prediction (data not shown) and no evidence of carcinogenic activity for only DB04698 as predicted by PreADMET rodent carcinogenicity prediction. We also analyzed other ADMET properties like blood-brain barrier penetration, skin permeability, MDCK cell, and P-gp inhibition, and in all of these cases results are positive for our proposed compounds (data not shown).",

Bacterial replicative dnaE is a member of C family of polymerases 87,88 that are unique in terms of sequence. Bacterial replicative DNA polymerase III share no sequence similarity and is strikingly different from canonical DNA polymerases including those of eukaryotic replicative polymerases. 89 It has been reported that DNA polymerases are responsible for pathogen survival and drug resistance so they have been considered to be a drug target in a broad group of Grampositive pathogens such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Mycoplasma. 90 It has also been reported that DNA polymerase III inactivation would impede survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis within the host. 91 Since bacterial evolution aims to acquire resistance against single or multiple antibiotics to ensure their survival in the environment, the development, not only of new conventional antibiotics but also of novel compounds and alternative strategies for the battle against bacterial infections, is becoming a topical and widely recognized need. In this study, a number of criteria such as essentiality of proteins, dissimilarity with host, conservation among pathogens, Table 3 Lowest docking energies, important residues of the binding site observed to be interactive with the ligands from DrugBank, percentage of human intestinal absorption and plasma protein binding, Caco-2 cell permeability and carcinogenicity in rats ",

DB04118 has no specific target yet. However, 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase of Helicobacter pylori (American Type Culture Collection strain 700392/26695), that catalyzes a trans-dehydration via an enolate intermediate, is the target for DB04698. These molecules could be proposed as potential inhibitors of the E. coli O157:H7 Sakai strand dnaE. For the identification of potential drug candidates human intestinal absorption is imperative.86 By using PreADMET we found human intestinal absorption was 95.36% and 88.10% for DB04118 and DB04698 respectively, indicating well-absorbed compounds (70%\u223c100% according to PreADMET) that is desirable for drug candidates. As only the unbound drug is necessary for diffusion or transport across the cell membranes and target-drug interaction, we predicted percent drug bound in plasma protein. Plasma protein binding prediction results showed 99.28% and 100.00% plasma protein binding for DB04118 and DB04698 respectively, indicating strongly bound chemicals which are not desirable. Caco-2 cell model serves as a reliable in vitro model for the prediction of oral drug absorption. PreADMET predicted 17.45 (nm/second) and 0.36 (nm/second) Caco-2 cell permeability for DB04118",
