            "text": "Cyclopeptide alkaloids are one of the chemotaxonomic specific constituents in Rhamnaceae plants, especially for Ziziphus species. They usually contain a p-or m-ansa 13-, 14-, or 15-membered ring structure that consists of a styrylamine moiety and two or three aamino acid residues (Tan and Zhou, 2006) . In some cases, they possess one or two N-methyl or N,N-dimethyl amino acids. Cyclopeptide alkaloids of Rhamnaceae plants are divided into three types: Ia, Ib, or Ic, according to ring structure size. The Ib-type alkaloids have 13-membered macrocyclic structures composed of a moxystyrylamino moiety, a ring bond amino acid, and a b-oxyproline moiety as an intermediate amino acid. Sedative, antibacterial, antifungal, antiplasmodial, antimycobacterial, and antimalarial effects have been reported for some cyclopeptide alkaloids (Gournelis et al., 1998; Panseeta et al., 2011; Tan and Zhou, 2006) .",

Although the fruit is the most widely used part of the plant for food, cyclopeptide alkaloids have been separated from other plant parts, especially from the stem bark. Four Ia-type (frangufoline, scutianine D, jubanine C, and mauritine A) and eight Ib-type cyclopeptide alkaloids (amphibine H, jubanine A, jubanine B, jubanine E, mucronine D, nummularine A, nummularine B, and zizy-phine A) have been isolated and reported from the Z. jujuba stem bark (Devi et al., 1987; Pandey et al., 2008; Tripathi et al., 2001; Tschesche et al., 1976) . However, the chemical constituents of Z. jujuba roots have been rarely reported. To the best of our knowledge, only one publication has reported cyclopeptide alkaloids from the Z. jujuba root. These alkaloids are mauritine A and seven Ib-type cyclopeptide alkaloids: mucronine D, amphibine H, jubanine A, jubanine B, jubanine D, nummularine A, and nummularine B (Khokhar et al., 1994) .",

            "text": "Air-dried pulverized roots of Z. jujuba were macerated with MeOH before preparing the alkaloid fraction with an acid-base method from the MeOH extract. This alkaloid fraction was subjected to silica gel column chromatography eluted with increasingly polar mixtures of CHCl 3 /MeOH. Further purification was performed using Sephadex LH-20 and preparative HPLC. As a result, eight cyclopeptide alkaloids (1-8) were isolated and chemically characterized. The UV spectra of 1-8 showed absorption bands at around 270 and 320 nm, which were caused by the characteristic styrylamine chromophore (Panseeta et al., 2011) . All eight compounds, therefore, could be 13-membered cyclopeptide alkaloids. This is because these absorption bands are not observed with 14-membered rings due to the strain of the ring system, except when there is a tryptophan moiety (Gournelis et al., 1998) . Three aromatic protons of the cyclopeptides exhibited an ABX spin system, e.g. d H 6.70 (1H, d, J = 3.2 Hz, H-12), d H 6.87 (1H, d, J = 9.2 Hz, H-15), and d H 6.80 (1H, dd, J = 3.2, 9.2 Hz, for 1 (Table 2 ). This suggests that compounds 1-8 had a moxystyrylamino moiety, which then suggests that they are 13membered cyclopeptide alkaloids (Lin et al., 2000) . In addition, based on 1 H-1 H COSY and 1 H-13 C HMBC spectroscopic data analyses and comparison with previously reported chemical shift analogs, the presence of a b-oxyproline moiety is possible for compounds 1-8 (Tan and Zhou, 2006) . Thus, compounds 1-8 were confirmed as Ib-type cyclopeptide alkaloids. The olefinic protons (H-1 and H-2) of 1-8 showed coupling constants (J) near 9.0 Hz, and a double bond geometry in styrylamino moieties were indicated to be in Z configurations.",

From the analysis of 1 H, 13 C, 1 H-1 H COSY, and 1 H-13 C HMBC NMR spectroscopic data (Fig. 2) , two valines and one terminal N-methylalanine moiety were suggested in 1 ( Table 1 ). The HMBC correlations between H-3 to C-4, H-6 to C-7, and H-9 to C-11 indicated linkages between a m-oxystyrylamino moiety and a valine, the valine and a b-oxyproline, and the b-oxyproline and the m-oxystyrylamino moiety, respectively. A NOE relationship between H-18 and H-21 was observed, which agreed with the b-oxyproline connection with another valine moiety. Thus, structure 1 was established as shown in Fig. 1 . The CD spectrum of 1 exhibited two negative Cotton effects around 265 and 321 nm, suggesting 5S,8S,9S-configurations (Schmidt et al., 1983) . No significant NOE enhancements were observed between H-5/H-8 and H-8/H-9 in the NOESY spectrum. This supported the 5S,8S,9S-configuration. A weak vicinal coupling between H-8 and H-9 (J = 3.2 Hz) suggests a trans orientation (Suksamrarn et al., 2005) . To confirm the configuration, acid hydrolysis of 1 was performed. The hydrolysate of 1 was treated with the D-FDLA (N a -(5-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl)-D-leucinamide) or L-FDLA (N a -(5-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-leucinamide) and the reaction products were analyzed by LC-MS (Fujii et al., 1997) . D-FDLA derivatives are retained longer than the L-FDLA derivatives on C-18 reverse phased HPLC, exhibiting amino acid residues of 1 as L-Val and L-N-Me-Ala, respectively. As a result, the configuration of compound 1 is shown in Fig. 1 . Compound 1 was named jubanine F after its plant origin.",

Compared to the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of 1, 2 differed in only one amino acid residue. Instead of a valine, two methyl (d C 10.8 and 15.1), one methylene (d C 24.5), and one methine (d C 37.4) signals were observed. 1 H-1 H COSY analysis indicated that these comprised an isoleucine residue. The HMBC cross-peaks of H-3 to C-4, H-6 to C-7, and H-22 to C-23 indicated connections between a m-oxystyrylamino moiety with a valine, the valine with a b-oxyproline, and an isoleucine with a Nmethylalanine, respectively. The absolute configurations of C-5, C-8, C-9, C-21, and C-1 000 were identified as S, S, S, S, and S by CD and advanced Marfey's method. However, 2 contained an isoleucine residue, and the absolute configuration at C-1 00 was determined by chromatographic analysis on GITC (2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-b-Dglucopyranosylisothiocyanate) derivatives (Hess et al., 2004) . The GITC derivatives of L-Ile and L-allo-Ile eluted very closely and co-injection experiments proved that the configuration of the Ile residue was L-Ile (21S, 1 00 S) instead of L-allo-Ile (21S, 1 00 R). Compound 2 was named jubanine G. The molecular formula of compound 3 was determined as C 30 H 45 N 5 O 6 by ESI-qTOF-MS. Since it is similar to compounds 1 and 2, it was determined that 3 has two isoleucine moieties as the ring bound amino acid and the intermediate amino acid residues, respectively. The absolute configurations of 5S, 8S, 9S, 21S, 1 0 S, 1 00 S, and 1 000 S were identified by the same methods for 1 and 2. Compound 3 was named jubanine H.",

Thus, 4 was deduced to have a terminal N,N-dimethylalanine instead of a mono-methyl substituted one. Additionally, the presence of a valine and an isoleucine residue was inferred from 1 H, 13 C, 1 H-1 H COSY, and HMBC NMR spectroscopic data. The links between a m-oxystyrylamino moiety with an isoleucine, the isoleucine with a b-oxyproline, and a valine with a N,N-dimethylalanine were respectively confirmed through HMBC interactions of H-3 to C-4, H-6 to C-7, and H-22 to C-23. The absolute configurations of 5S, 8S, 9S, 21S, 1 0 S, and 1 00 S were identified by the same methods as used for the previous compounds 1-3. The absolute configuration of N,N-dimethylalanine was confirmed by chromatographic analyses of the N,N-dimethylalanine with phenylglycine methylester hydrochloride (PGME) amide coupling products (Um et al., 2013) . The PGME derivatives of the synthetic N,N-dimethylalanine were analyzed by LC-MS and the synthetic amides of Land D-N,N-dimethylalanine had retention times of 8.83 min and 10.24 min, respectively. The N,N-dimethylalanine-PGME amide derived from compound 4 was detected at 8.79 min. Thus, the absolute configuration of N,N-dimethylalanine in compound 4 was identified as l (S) and compound 4 was named jubanine I.",

Compound 8 was identified as a compound previously isolated and reported, but not given a trivial name (Barboni et al., 1994) . For convenience, compound 8 is named mucronine K, after the plant name in which this compound was first isolated. Pocrine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection in pigs causes epidemic diarrhea, dehydration, and vomiting. Most newborn piglets infected by PEDV would be dying with almost 100% mortality and pigs of all ages are also affected. Infection with this virus has been become a serious economic loss in the swine industry and recent outbreaks led to serious economic losses in many swine producing countries. Only compounds 1-3, and 6 were screened for their antiviral potential against PEDV, due to the scarce amounts of other compounds that were obtained. Compounds 2, 3, and 6 showed potent inhibitory effects on PEDV infected Vero cells, as shown in Table 3 . Compounds 3 and 6 showed EC 50 values at the micromolar range (EC 50 4.49 \u00b1 0.67 and 6.17 \u00b1 0.50 lM, respectively), which was potent as compared to the positive control 6-azauridine (5.58 \u00b1 0.53 lM). However, both compounds showed much lower cytotoxicity (CC 50 211.26 \u00b1 29.64 and 165.30 \u00b1 16.49 lM, respectively) compared to the positive control (44.47 \u00b1 6.11 lM), so they had higher selective index (SI) values (47.11 \u00b1 0.49 and 26 .75 \u00b1 0.54, respectively) than 6-azauridine (7.98 \u00b1 0.37). Compound 2 exhibited lower potency than 3 and 6 (EC 50 13.41 \u00b1 1.13 lM), but 2 also demonstrated high SI values due to the very low cytotoxicity (CC 50 > 400 lM).",

After 30 min of incubation at rt, 5% AcOH (40 lL) was added to a reaction vial to quench the reaction. MeOH (50 lL) was added to the reaction residues to prepare LC-MS samples. An authentic standard was also prepared from the same procedure. For the GITC product analysis of natural hydrolysates and standard amino acids, the following chromatographic method was used: solvent A was H 2 O:MeCN with 0.1% HCO 2 H (95:5, v/v), solvent B was MeCN with 0.1% HCO 2 H. The LC-MS program for detecting the GITC-derivatives was set as 5% solvent B (0-7 min), 5-27% solvent B (7-12 min), 27-28.5% solvent B (12-45 min), 28.5-100% solvent B (45-46 min) , and 100-100% solvent B (46-51 min) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The reaction products were analyzed on a positive mode with a LC-MS system. The co-injection experiments of the GITC-derivatized hydrolysates with authentic amino acid derivatives (L-Ile and L-allo-Ile) were established so that Ile residues in 2-5 are all L-Ile (Retention time:L-Ile-GITC (33.67 min)/L-allo-Ile-GITC (33.31 min)).
