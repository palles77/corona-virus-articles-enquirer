The ferret was anesthetized as previously described for the procedure. Primary transverse CT acquisition parameters included a 2.5-mmslice thickness with 1.25-mm overlap, pitch of 0.938:1, 0.8-second rotation time, 100 kV, and 100 mA. Subsequent multiplanar reformatting was performed to obtain images with a 0.625mm-slice thickness. After survey thoracic CT, 2-mL/kg (600-mg/kg) nonionic iodinated contrast medium (Omnipaque 300 iohexol injection; GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ USA) was administered intraosseously as a bolus and postcontrast images were obtained. CT evaluation revealed a large, cystic heterogeneously contrast-enhancing, soft tissue-attenuating cranial mediastinal mass extending from the thoracic inlet to the cranial aspect of the heart and from the left to right thoracic wall. This mass completely encircled the brachycephalic trunk and partially encircled the cranial vena cava. The mass measured an estimated 18 mm in height \u03eb 27 mm in width \u03eb 31 mm in length. Complete alveolarization of the left and right cranial lung lobes with partial alveolar disease in the right middle lung lobe was also noted. A mild amount of pleural-free fluid was identified in addition to sternal lymphadenopathy. Thymoma and thymic lymphoma remained the most likely differentials for the cranial mediastinal mass. Sternal lymphadenopathy was considered either metastatic or alternatively a normal variant. Pulmonary changes were still considered to be most likely secondary to atelectasis with possible concurrent edema.",

One of the earliest reports of coronavirus infection in ferrets described coronavirusassociated epizootic catarrhal enteritis. In that retrospective study, domestic ferrets with a clinical history of diarrhea and a lack of a definitive etiology, in addition to one or more of the following microscopic lesions: vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of villus enterocytes; villous atrophy, fusion, and blunting; and lymphoplasmacytic enteritis characterized by a subjective increase in number of intraepithelial lymphocytes, were evaluated. A total of 119 cases met the inclusion criteria that determined a definitive diagnosis. Coronavirus particles were identified in feces and jejunal enterocytes by use of transmission electron microscopy. Immunohistochemical staining of jejunal sections also revealed coronavirus antigens that were not detected in healthy ferrets or in ferrets with other gastrointestinal diseases. 9 In a later study using consensus polymerase chain reaction assays for the genus Coronavirus, followed by genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analyses, a separate group provided the first molecular evidence that the virus associated with epizootic catarrhal enteritis in ferrets was, in fact, a new coronavirus tentatively designated as \"ferret enteric coronavirus.\" 10 FIGURE 6. Dorsal plane 3D-volume-rendering CT obtained in the same postcontrast phase as in Figure 5 .

Although uncomplicated epizootic catarrhal enteritis is considered to be self-limiting or treatable with supportive care and characterized by having high morbidity and low mortality rates, the multisystemic granulomatous coronavirusassociated disease identified in our case is characterized by a much more severe phenotype resembling feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is similarly caused by a feline coronavirus.",

Twenty-three ferrets diagnosed with systemic pyogranulomatous inflammation resembling FIP were enrolled in a case series. The average age at the time of diagnosis was 11 months, with progressive disease identified in all cases. Nonspecific clinical signs including anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, and large palpable intraabdominal masses were common clinical findings, whereas neurological deficits, vomiting, and dyspnea were reported with less frequency. Hyperglobulinemia was documented in 9 ferrets, mild nonregenerative anemia in 11 ferrets, and thrombocytopenia in 3 ferrets. Mesenteric adipose tissue and lymph nodes, liver, kidney, spleen, and lung were all reported sites of grossly visible pyogranulomatous lesions. Immunohistochemically, all cases were positive for coronavirus antigen. 12 There were no reports of mediastinal or cardiac involvement. Diffuse granulomatous inflammation on serosal surfaces was identified in the heart of a single case in a separate study. 13 In an attempt to improve antemortem diagnosis of systemic coronavirus infection in the domestic ferret, the radiographic and ultrasonographic findings in affected patients were later described. In all patients undergoing abdominal radiography, moderate to severe loss of the lumbar musculature was noted. Decreased peritoneal and retroperitoneal serosal detail, gas distension of the gastrointestinal tract, mid-abdominal soft tissue opaque masses, renomegaly, and splenomegaly were also reported to a variable degree. Ultrasonographic findings included peritoneal effusion, hyperechoic mesentery, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, ill-defined mixed echoic mass lesions, renomegaly, and pyelectasia. The authors concluded that imaging signs of peritonitis, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and soft tissue abdominal masses are highly suspicious for systemic coronavirus infection. Hepatic and splenic changes were reportedly inconclusive. 14 This case report describes the first case of systemic coronavirus infection in a ferret with the development of a space-occupying cranial mediastinal mass; highlighting the importance of thoracic imaging in patients presenting with nonspecific clinical signs and laboratory changes that are suggestive of chronic inflammatory disease. Although lymphoma and thymoma remain the most commonly reported etiologies for development of cranial mediastinal mass lesions in young ferrets, infectious diseases, including coronavirus, should be considered; especially in the face of inconclusive cytological results. This is also the first report of contrast-enhanced thoracic CT characterization of a cranial mediastinal mass in the domestic ferret. Advanced imaging proved to be beneficial in more accurately characterizing the origin and vascularity of the primary mass lesion and permitted for more sensitive assessment of concurrent pulmonary lesions.",

Reported therapeutic strategies, most commonly those used in cats, include immunosuppressive therapy (prednisolone most commonly), immunomodulatory therapy, vasculitis therapy, and treatment of clinical disease (e.g., anti-emetics, gastro-protectants, antibiotic therapy, and nutritional support). 15 ",
