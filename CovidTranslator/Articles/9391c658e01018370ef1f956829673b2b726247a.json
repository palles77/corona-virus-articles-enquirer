Antisense oligonucleotide binding to mature microRNA and splicing junctions on pre-mRNA represent methods of gene therapy that respectively inhibit microRNAmediated gene regulation and induce alternative splicing. We have developed biodegradable polymer nanoparticles--which are coated with cell-penetrating peptides--that can effectively deliver chemically-modified oligonucleotide analogs to achieve these forms of gene regulation. We found that this nanoparticle system could block the activity of the oncogenic microRNA, miR-155, as well as modulate splicing to attenuate the expression of the proto-oncogene, MCL-1. Regulation of these genes in human cancer cells reduced cell viability and produced pro-apoptotic effects. These findings establish polymer nanoparticles as delivery vectors for non-conventional forms of gene therapy activated by cellular delivery of RNA-targeted molecules, which have strong therapeutic implications.",

            "text": "Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) and peptide nucleic acids (PNA) are nucleic acid analogs that exhibit excellent stability and enhanced binding affinity for target nucleic acids compared with conventional DNA-or RNA-based antisense oligonucleotides. Over the past decade, microRNAs have emerged as potent therapeutic targets due to their regulation of numerous biological processes, particularly those related to diseases such as cancer. 8 Through binding to complementary microRNA (miRNA), anti-miR oligonucleotide analogs, such as PMOs and PNAs, can suppress miRNA activity and thus de-suppress miRNA-based downregulation of gene expression (Figure 1 ). 9 Additionally, PMOs and PNAs can modulate splicing of pre-mRNA. Through binding to the 3' acceptor and 5' donor splice sites flanking an exon, splice-shifting oligonucleotides can mask exons from the splicing machinery, which can yield variant isoforms ( Figure 1 ). As with miRNAs, many diseases, including cancer, can be linked to aberrant splicing or the presence of unwanted gene isoforms. 10, 11 In this study, we investigate the inhibition of a specific miRNA, miR-155, which is one of the first identified miRNA oncogenes, as well as the spliceshifting of Mcl-1, which is a member of the Bcl-2 family that has both anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic isoforms. [12] [13] [14] Only a few prior studies describe the encapsulation of either PMOs or PNAs into nanoscale delivery systems. Previously, PMOs have been conjugated to protein-and dendrimer-based nanovehicles. 15, 16 These systems have shown success in the delivery of antisense agents in vivo; however, we hypothesized that loading a high density of freely distributed PMOs into NPs may improve delivery efficacy. We have previously shown that NPs can deliver PNAs in association with DNA in order to direct site-specific genomic recombination; however, the DNA component required the addition of a polycation counter-ion, spermidine, for efficient loading. 17 Like most nucleic acid delivery vehicles, NPs can comprise a cationic component that facilitates association with anionic DNA or RNA. However, such polycations may have deleterious returns, for example: once inside a cell, the electrostatic complexes must dissociate to release bioactive nucleic acids; cationic agents may have nonspecific interactions with off-target cellular components; and molecules that can become heavily protonated may induce cellular toxicity through osmotic swelling of intracellular vesicles. 18 A cationic component is not essential for NP formation, which can be based on an emulsion-driven process. Therefore, we hypothesized that NPs devoid of cationic additives could load high densities of charge-neutral oligonucleotide analogs. Unlike other nucleic acids, the backbones of PMOs and PNAs have a neutral charge density; therefore, loading of PMOs and PNAs into NPs presents a platform for the delivery of antisense-based gene therapy that does not rely on electrostatic interactions.",

Samples from the first 2 hours and subsequent 10 hours produced over 80% inhibition of luciferase activity and expression. Samples from the next 12 and then 24 hours achieved less inhibition than the aforementioned burst release phase samples, probably due to the slower PMO release rate (and resulting fewer PMO molecules collected in the sample supernatant) during the collection period.

To monitor the inhibition of miR-155 we used a dual luciferase reporter system in which the target binding sequence for miR-155 was inserted into the 3'UTR of Renilla luciferase; Firefly luciferase was used for normalization. Endogenous miR-155 represses Renilla luciferase expression, but this can be de-repressed in the presence of anti-miR-155. KB cells transfected with this sensor exhibited more than a 4-fold increase in normalized Renilla luciferase activity after being exposed to ARG-NPs delivering anti-miR-155 ( Figure 4A ). In accordance with attenuation of miR-155 function, detectable levels of miR-155 in KB cells decreased in response to anti-miR-155 delivered by ARG-NPs ( Figure 4B ). Importantly, ARG-NPs decreased miR-155 levels t\u00f5 60% while NPs with no surface modification only decreased levels to ~ 80% relative to untreated cells. Cells treated with ARG-NPs loaded with a scrambled control PMO anti-miR (CRL) showed no miR-155 loss, which further emphasizes the specificity of this miRNAbased therapeutic strategy. Interestingly, despite the greater RNA binding affinity of PNAs compared to PMOs, both PNAs and PMOs functioned comparably as ant-miRs. Therefore, for the rest of this study, we focused on the nanoparticulate-based delivery of PMOs.",

Oligonucleotides that mask exons simultaneously reduce the production of a specific gene isoform and induce the splicing and subsequent transcription of another isoform. A unique property of charge-neutral oligonucleotide analogs is their ability to passively diffuse into the nucleus, the site-of-action for alternative splicing. 21 Therefore, we postulated that ARG-NPs could effectively transport charge-neutral PMOs into cells and to the cytosol (Figure 1 ) where subsequently released PMOs could translocate to the nucleus and induce alternative splicing. We observed that FITC-labeled PMOs delivered by ARG-NPs were able to enter the nucleus of KB cells ( Figure 5A ). We do not exclude the possibility that ARG-NPs have a direct role in facilitating nuclear transport of PMOs; however, it is more likely that sustained release of PMOs from ARG-NPs generated a diffusion gradient into the nucleus.",

We have previously demonstrated that NPs can capitalize on the membrane transduction properties of surface-attached CPPs. 5 Whether through direct membrane translocation, endocytosis, a combination of both, or an entirely different mechanism, ARG enters cells and ultimately reaches the cytoplasm. 1, 26, 27 These processes are likely confounded by the tethering of polymer nanoparticles to the peptide; however, ARG-NPs were observed to be freely distributed in the cytosol (Figure 1 ). We note that the seemingly greater degree of ARG-NP uptake by cells when visualized by confocal microscopy ( Figure 5A ) compared to TEM (Figure 1 ) is a result of both the larger field of view and the thicker imaged section for the confocal imaging-the TEM slice thickness was 50 nm while the confocal imaging plane z-height was 0.9 \u00b5m. Based on these images, we estimate that the intracellular density of ARG-NPs is between 0.1 NP/um 3 (which we estimate from Fig 5A) and 1 NP/um 3 (which we estimate from Fig 1) .\" Escaping endolysosomal degradation and vesicular sequestration is paramount for nucleic acids that are intended to bind miRNA in the cytosol or pre-mRNA in the nucleus.",

Fabrication of PLGA NPs relies on the hydrophobic effect instead of charged interactions. Due to their chargeneutral backbone, PMOs and PNAs demonstrated higher loading into NPs compared to anionic nucleic acids (Table 1) . Additionally, PNAs and PMOs had comparably high encapsulation densities which can be attributed to their similar chemical compositions and physical properties. NPs were formed using a double emulsion solvent evaporation process; therefore, denser loading of charge-neutral oligonucleotide analogs was likely due to the lack of intermolecular electrostatic repulsion that promotes outward diffusion of nucleic acids during NP fabrication. Furthermore, PLGA NPs have widespread applicability as a delivery platform because they can function as a reservoir for controlled release of encapsulated drugs. Agents entrapped in PLGA NPs are gradually released through diffusion and hydrolysis of the polymer matrix. Although the release of PMOs, PNAs, and ssDNA followed similar kinetics ( Figure 3A) , the greater loading density of PMOs and PNAs makes them potentially effective agents for NP-mediated gene therapy.",

[30] [31] [32] [33] [34] The most effective delivery strategies involve the administration of free chemically-modified antisense molecules, so encapsulation of a high density of these agents into PLGA NPs may provide a dosing advantage using a delivery system that has a history of in vivo success. 35 The observed loading amounts of PNAs and PMOs into NPs were therapeutically relevant, particularly for an anti-miR-based approach. We calculated that a single NP contains ~500 anti-miR molecules. Cancers that are connected to miRNA oncogenes typically have between 100-10,000 copies of the aberrantly expressed miRNA per cell. [36] [37] [38] Therefore, delivery of between 1 and 20 nanoparticles per cancer cell would be sufficient to match the anti-miR dose with target miRNA levels. Similar calculations are less predictive when targeting pre-mRNA, since a single alternatively spliced mRNA can be translated to produce numerous copies of a protein.",

Additionally, inhibition of miR-155 and splice-shifting of Mcl-1 induces apoptosis via different biological pathways. miR-155 downregulates a multitude of cellular targets that directly promote apoptosis including TP53INP1, CASP3, SHIP1, and FOXO3a, as well as ancillary anti-survival targets such as SOCS1 and SMAD5.

The splicing pattern of ARG-NPs delivering scrambled control PMOs (Mcl-1S/Mcl-1L ~ 0.03) was unchanged from that of untreated cells (Mcl-1S/Mcl-1L ~ 0.03). Delivery of PMOs by ARG-NPs was observed to be as effective as the positive control, Endo-Porter (Gene Tools LLC., Philomath, OR, USA), in altering splicing (Mcl-1S/Mcl-1L ~ 2;",
