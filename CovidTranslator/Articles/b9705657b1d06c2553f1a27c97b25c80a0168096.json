The new IRRISS score performed as well as the COAST score. (J Pediatr 2019;214: . R espiratory infections are among the most common illnesses encountered in infancy and early childhood. 1, 2 When symptomatic, these infections induce a range of disease severity, from mild congestion to severe respiratory distress requiring hospitalization. Respiratory infections in infancy have also been associated with respiratory morbidity in later childhood suggesting the importance of these infections to health and the need to fully understand how early infections relate to later disease. [3] [4] [5] Much has been learned about the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens causing early life infections owing to the introduction of molecular detection methods. 6, 7 However, there is a significant need for a validated research assessment tool to measure the severity of respiratory illnesses among infants to understand disease risk as well as clinical and biological modifiers of respiratory disease severity. There are no widely accepted research tools to measure illness severity in infants with respiratory infections except those with bronchiolitis. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Most respiratory illnesses and infections in infants do not require hospitalization or medical intervention; thus, to measure the full range of respiratory symptom severity, a tool reflecting outpatient symptoms is needed.",

One of the aims of PRISM is to identify symptomatic and asymptomatic respiratory infections over the first 2 years of life to understand the effect of repeated infections on respiratory morbidity in early childhood. The ability to measure respiratory illness symptomatology and severity is a key component of this aim and the subject of this report. As such, we first determined the validity of the COAST Scorecard for measuring illness severity in the PRISM birth cohort, including both term and preterm infants, selected without regard to risk of wheezing. As a secondary aim, we developed a new data-driven scoring system of disease severity based on the 10-day illness diary cards kept by parents for the PRISM infants and young children. We compared the new scoring system with the COAST score in an attempt to create a more broadly applicable, sensitive, and specific measure of respiratory illness severity to be used as a tool for research.",

Additionally, the use of the COAST scorecard was reviewed with each family via a printed diary form before discharge from the birth hospitalization and at each visit. Families were reminded to begin filling out the scorecard and to notify the study team when their child developed respiratory symptoms resulting in a score of \u00b33 and to continue completing the scorecard daily until 10 days had elapsed or the child's symptoms dropped below a score of 3. [18] [19] [20] The scorecard assigns points to the presence or absence of fever \u00b3100 F, hoarseness, wheezing, retractions, tachypnea, cyanosis, apnea, being ill for >4 days, and the de-gree of cough and rhinorrhea. Maximal possible score is 31 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. The PRISM study sought to identify all respiratory infections with the full range of severity so a threshold score of 3 was chosen as a sensitive measure of illness. When parents reported a COAST score of \u00b33, a study visit was completed and respiratory samples obtained. Staff followed up with families to ensure scorecard completion and also reviewed the 3 days before when a score of 3 was reached, so that the full range of illness was recorded. For participants with baseline respiratory symptoms such as retractions or wheezing, the families were instructed to assign points only when findings were greater than baseline.",

Cyanosis and apnea were rare, so were not considered. A value of 10 was added to each weighted score to produce all positive values. The first factor explained the largest amount of the variance in the data (51.2%) and was used to assign weights to the variables in the new Infant Research Respiratory Infection Severity Score (IRRISS). LMER models were again used to validate the IRRISS with the detection of a viral respiratory pathogen as well as hospitalization as measures of disease severity.

[24] [25] [26] Houben et al found that term infants with RSV infection had greater disease severity using the COAST score than infants with other viral infections providing preliminary validation of the score. 27 Although modifications of the COAST score have been used in subsequent respiratory disease studies, further efforts to validate the score to measure disease severity have not been reported. 28, 29 Marginal analysis of our data confirmed an association between a COAST score of \u00b33 and the presence of a viral infection. Multivariate modeling analyses further demonstrated that the maximal COAST score reported over a 10-day period for each illness and the average AUC of the COAST score were both associated with the presence of a symptomatic RSV infection and hospitalization in our cohort. In addition, our analyses consistently identified an inverse association between the COAST score and infection with hRV, as compared with infections with other viruses. This finding is in keeping with hRV infections generally causing milder respiratory disease. 26, 30 The COAST score was also consistently inversely related to gestational age at birth. These data provide validation of the COAST score to measure respiratory disease severity in the first 2 years of life in a new cohort of term and preterm infants.",

Our aim was to determine if the data would provide more accurate weightings of symptoms in measuring illness severity than the original investigator-assigned symptom weights. Additionally, we sought to develop a more accurate score that would be useful in the research setting with both preterm and term infants without regard to a family history of asthma or atopy, risk factors required in the COAST study. The IR-RISS score demonstrated very good construct validity; it was significantly associated with RSV infections and hospitalization in both the maximal and average AUC scores, similar to the COAST score. Like the COAST score, the IRRISS score was also inversely associated with hRV infections. Separating the cohort into preterm and term sets and estimating individual factor models for each group did not provide consistent results. The COAST score and IRRISS also did not perform as well when applied only to the term infants included in our cohort, which may be due to the smaller number of subjects and illnesses in each group.",

An additional consistent finding was that hRV infections were negatively associated with illness severity when compared with illness mostly owing to RSV and other viral respiratory infections. This finding is in keeping with prior reports of generally milder illness in infants with hRV infections, as noted. 26, 30 Although previous research identified hRV as a cause of severe lower respiratory infections in infants, the association with disease severity seems to be due to underlying comorbidities such as prematurity, rather than virus type. 30, 31, 33 The strengths of this study include the prospective, 2-year longitudinal design in a large cohort with state-of-the-art molecular detection methods to identify respiratory pathogens. We also included preterm and term infants in our study without regard to a predisposition to atopy or asthma and were able to evaluate the characteristics of the severity scores on both groups, a novel contribution.",

The finding that the COAST score and the IRRISS were highly correlated is not unexpected, because they are based on the same constellation of symptoms. However, the IRRISS assigned weightings to symptoms based upon the data as a means to accurately capture the influence of each symptom on severity. However, these data-driven methods provided only marginal improvement over the original COAST score in this cohort. The ease of use of the COAST scorecard by parents makes it a simple tool for collecting symptom data in studies of respiratory illnesses in the first 2 years of life. Analysis of the PRISM study supports the COAST scorecard as a valid tool for measuring respiratory illness severity in preterm and term infants without regard to risk for atopy and asthma. n Figure 2 .

The dendrogram was created with data from the dissimilarity matrix analyses of respiratory symptoms including wheeze, cough, hoarseness, tachypnea, retractions, sick for >4 days, runny nose and fever. It suggests a physiologic relationship among these 8 symptoms. Figure 3 . Computation of the IRRSS score.

None of the 4 drugs altered the clinical course of pertussis when given in paroxysmal stage. Nasopharyngeal clearance was achieved in those receiving erythromycin, oxytetracycline, and chloramphenicol. The erythromycin group was rendered noninfective within 3 days. All 3 drugs showed bacteriologic relapse in some of the cases. Pertussis hyperimmune globulin also did not alter the clinical or bacteriologic course of the illness. Fifty years later, macrolides remain the gold standard to eradicate nasal bacterial carriage of Bordetella pertussis and for pre-exposure prophylaxis in asymptomatic contacts. However, their effectiveness for the treatment of pertussis is still questionable. Erythromycin may be effective in shortening the illness only when given in pre-paroxysmal stage. Due to the toxic profile of erythromycin and its causative association with idiopathic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in newborns, in 2005 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended azithromycin as the preferred macrolide for infants <1 month age with pertussis. 1 The American Family Physician Society and the American Society of Microbiology have recommended azithromycin as the first-line drug for pertussis at all age groups. 2,3 Trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole also is recommended as an alternative drug for infants >2 months of age. 4 The American Family Physician Society also has shortened the duration of antibiotic administration",
