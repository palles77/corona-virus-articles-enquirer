            "text": "Research Collaboration with 2-1-1 to Eliminate Health Disparities An Introduction Laura A. Linnan, ScD I n 2011, the DHHS released two compelling documents that represent the f\u0131rst national, coordinated effort to address health disparities in the U.S. Taken together, the HHS Health Plan to Eliminate Health Disparities 1 and the National Stakeholder Strategy for Achieving Health Equity 2 provided a needed roadmap of goals, objectives, timelines, and a plan for ongoing stakeholder input from public and private sector initiatives and partnerships to ensure that progress on eliminating health disparities will be a measurable, primary focus of national, state, and local initiatives. As Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, DHHS, acknowledged: \"It is time to refocus, reinforce, and repeat the message that health disparities exist and that health equity benef\u0131ts everyone.\" 1 This call to action, backed by the DHHS and representatives from myriad health-related organizations, was integrated into the Healthy People 2020 health objectives planning effort (www.healthypeople.gov) and represents a mobilization of resources and political will for the f\u0131ght to eliminate health disparities. Moreover, a number of provisions within the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; PL 111-148 [HR 3590]), have been leveraged to bolster efforts aimed at eliminating health disparities by closing the gap associated with unequal access to health care and preventive services. These national efforts are a perfect backdrop for the work described in the papers [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] in this supplement to the American Journal of Preventive Medicine titled \"Research Collaborations with 2-1-1 to Eliminate Health Disparities.\" To facilitate the development of this special issue, the 2-1-1 Health Research Working Group brought together researchers and 2-1-1 system leaders to work collaboratively toward a shared goal addressing the health needs of low-income Americans by raising awareness of the opportunities, benef\u0131ts, and potential of engaging in 2-1-1 research collaborations; capturing and sharing success stories from 2-1-1 systems nationally; setting a research agenda that supports and enhances 2-1-1 services; and facilitating collaborations between 2-1-1 systems and researchers that develop and test innovative ideas to improve service for 2-1-1 callers. Importantly, the collection of articles and commentaries in this special issue will help inform policymakers about the importance of 2-1-1 research collaborations for eliminating health disparities.",

The unequal distribution of social, economic, political, legal, and/or environmental resources gives rise to these health disparities. Disproportionately high rates of the leading causes of death, as well as behavioral risk factors that precede these health conditions often result from limited or unsafe housing, food insecurity, no or limited access to health care, low-wage work opportunities, and limited educational opportunities.",

The United Way operates roughly 40% of the 2-1-1 programs; while 60% are operated by nonprof\u0131t and municipal agencies. In 2011, nearly 17 million calls to the 2-1-1 system resulted in connections to a wide range of social services and programs. Calls to 2-1-1 are often emotional, with people looking for help given a lack of food or shelter; when unemployment benef\u0131ts run out; during (or in the aftermath of) a natural disaster such as a flood, hurricane, or tornado; or with questions about what to do during disease outbreaks such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or West Nile virus. Callers interact with trained specialists who are expert problem-solvers, empathic, and skilled in resource identif\u0131cation, matching, and referral. Thus, others rightly have stated that the 2-1-1 system provides \"a national safety network for persons to get access readily to assistance\" (www.fcc.gov/ guides/dial-211-essential-community-services).",

Data suggest that 2-1-1 callers are often at lower income and education levels, may be minority status by race/ethnicity, suffer higher rates of unemployment or job insecurity, 21 and as a result, they represent populations that suffer disproportionately from a wide range of health disparities. Yet these same individuals are often considered diff\u0131cult to reach, are less likely to have a primary care provider, are less likely to get preventive health services, and are less likely to participate in most types of research. Rather than relying on costly, time-consuming recruitment efforts via media or outreach to f\u0131nd and enroll high-risk individuals in ongoing research efforts, with a fully engaged 2-1-1 research partner, each call holds the potential for sharing life-saving information for providing needed interventions or services and/or systematically evaluating the effects.

This study provides evidence of public broadcasting's ability to increase the reach of information and referral services, but it also serves as a great example of the potential that 2-1-1 partnerships have to disseminate information on needed resources nationally and quickly, as local public broadcasting and 2-1-1 systems are found in many communities across the country. These exemplars of 2-1-1 partnerships show how research can influence the development and implementation of programs and policies to help mitigate the impact of future disasters. Results can be applied to improve planning and to better address the needs of certain subgroups who are vulnerable and less able to respond effectively to the negative impact of disasters.",

Most articles in this supplement demonstrate that a major strength of the 2-1-1 research partnership is relatively easy, quick, and cost-effective access to population subgroups that are traditionally diff\u0131cult to reach and often suffer the greatest health risks. These 2-1-1 articles are an example to other researchers who are intending to develop research partnerships that work toward eliminating health disparities among special subgroups.",

Specif\u0131cally, Shank 4 examines how cost analyses have been referenced as 2-1-1 has spread across the U.S. with an eye toward understanding how these data influence policy diffusion and uptake. Although Shank provides an important f\u0131rst look at costs, future expansion of 2-1-1 will demand increasing accountability, including more analysis of costs, benef\u0131ts, and return on investment associated with 2-1-1 programs and services. Eddens and colleagues 13 tackle an important methodologic and pragmatic question about whether the implementation of a minimal intervention research study in a 2-1-1 call center has adverse effects on key call-related quality indicators. Results from this study suggest that crises causing spikes in call volume adversely affect 2-1-1 service quality indicators as well as accrual of research participants. Thus, as the complexity or duration of an intervention or research demand is extended, support to expand 2-1-1 staff\u0131ng is likely required.",

Initial f\u0131ndings of this innovative and important work suggest that routinely collected 2-1-1 service request data may be useful in identifying callers with specif\u0131c cancer prevention and control needs. To apply this approach in 2-1-1 systems across the country, standardization of service request categories will be necessary. An increasingly rigorous application of flexible designs, mixed methods, and innovative statistical analyses and modeling techniques are showcased throughout this issue.

Mindful of the need to minimize burden on the 2-1-1 system, he makes a strong case for the benef\u0131ts of eHealth and mHealth technology as an essential component of an overall approach to improving health outcomes among callers to the 2-1-1 system who face health disparities.",

This paper is a timely review of how 2-1-1 may best f\u0131t into the changing policies and structural changes underway within the U.S. healthcare system. After a brief review of key features of the ACA, and acknowledging that its full implementation will depend (in part) on the results of upcoming elections, they thoughtfully review ways in which 2-1-1 might play a role in improving health and healthcare access for its callers. For example, they propose that the 2-1-1 system is best positioned to share information with callers about their eligibility for different types of health coverage and how to enroll in programs for which they are eligible (Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicaid, and [new] healthcare exchanges); referring individuals to available health programs/services in the local community (health centers/clinics); and providing healthcare assistance to new immigrants who may benef\u0131t from additional navigation services. They conclude by acknowledging that 2-1-1 has an important role to play for Americans who are newly eligible for insurance gain coverage and access to medical services due to ACA; particularly in \"connecting the uninsured to safety-net resources.\"",

The Working Group consisted of an interdisciplinary team of researchers who believe that the 2-1-1 system can play an important role in addressing health disparities by influencing policy and practice through strong research partnerships that build the knowledge and evidence base. As a key leader within the initial Working Group, Dr. Kreuter 3 provides an exemplary overview of this research potential and a rationale for why health researchers should develop partnerships with 2-1-1 to address disparities in health. His overarching and compelling message is that \"few, if any, health or social service organizations are better suited to deliver on the triad goals of reach-effectiveness-connections than 2-1-1.\"",

To that end, Hall and members of the initial 2-1-1 Health Research Working Group 19 prepared an excellent summary of the challenges, opportunities, and recommendations for advancing future 2-1-1 research. Specif\u0131cally, they identify a need to articulate conceptual frameworks to address how the 2-1-1 system f\u0131ts into the larger public health context as well as mapping existing and potential interconnections between 2-1-1 services, referrals, and other organizations that play critical roles in enhancing the health and well-being of the nation.",
