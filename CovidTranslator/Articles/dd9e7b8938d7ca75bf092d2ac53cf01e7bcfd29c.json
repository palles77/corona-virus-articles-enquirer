            "text": "Pathogens in general and pathogenic viruses in particular have evolved a myriad of mechanisms to escape the immune response of mammalian species. Viruses that cause acute disease tend to bear characteristics that make them very contagious, as survival does not derive from chronicity of infection, but spread of disease throughout the herd. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is one of the most contagious viruses known. Upon infection of susceptible species, cloven-hoofed animals, the virus proliferates rapidly and causes a vesicular disease within 2-4 days. Disease symptoms resolve by 10 days to 2 weeks and in most cases, virus can no longer be detected. Periods of fever and viremia are usually brief, 1-3 days. In vivo control of virus infection and clearance of the virus during and following acute infection is of particular interest. The interaction of this virus with cells mediating the early, innate immune response has been analyzed in a number of recent studies. In most reports, the virus has a distinct inhibitory effect on the response of cells early in infection. Here we review these new data and discuss the dynamics of the interaction of virus with different cell types mediating the immune response to infection.",

For this reason throughout the review, we frequently refer to established facts in other species to indicate areas in large animal immunology where data is lacking.

However, it remains to be proven if these developmental differences are translated into functional differences. Moreover, according to Hein and Dudler [2] , in sheep, establishment of a normal \u2425\u2426 T cell repertoire in the periphery is developmentally regulated and dependent on the continual presence of a functional thymus during ontogeny.",

In large animals, we also face yet another unknown, that being, the precise role the innate immune cells play. For instance, data in both mouse and humans show that individuals genetically lacking NK cells suffer from severe and recurrent infections [6] [7] [8] .

As in other species, bovine NK cells also express natural cytotoxicity receptors like CD335, produce IFN\u2425, lyse sensitive targets and appear to have a CD335 + /CD2 +/\u2212 /CD8 +/\u2212 /CD3 \u2212 phenotype [12, 14, 15] . Evidence that bovine NK cells are capable of lysing an infected target was initially demonstrated by Boysen et al. [16] and later by Klevar et al. [17] , in their studies with Neospora caninum. Similar observations have been made by others regarding activation of NK cells by other microorganisms [18, 19] . Bovine NK cells also express a short form of natural-killer group 2, member D protein (NKG2D, an activating receptor found on NK and CD8 + T cells) which associates with signaling adaptors such as DNAX activation proteins of 10 kDa (DAP10) and 12 kDa, DAP12 [20] . Furthermore, NKG2D expressed on CD335 + cells in peripheral blood, mesenteric lymph nodes and intraepithelial cells binds to bovine MIC1 (bovine leukocyte antigen-like molecule 1) and MIC4. In vitro culture of bovine peripheral blood CD335 + cells with soluble MIC1 or MIC4, showed increased NK cell response in form of IFN\u2425 production, indicating that bovine MIC1 and MIC4 are ligands for NK cell-expressed NKG2D [21] . A review by Boysen and Storset [22] tabulates many more receptors and cell markers expressed by bovine NK cells.",

            "text": "During transportation of cattle, the stress response of these animals is characterized by activation of NK cells indicating that these play a role in innate response [26, 27] . In other infections of cattle such as N. caninum [17] , an initial decrease in peripheral blood NK cells is observed in the early times of infection (4-6 days post infection). However, NK cells significantly increase later, at 11-15 days post infection, acting as early responders to invasion with this parasite. This study did not report if this increase affected the clearance of the parasite. According to Dennis et al. [18] , NK cells are directly involved in the elimination of Mycobacterium bovis infected macrophages (M ). The NK cells interact with and enhance the capability of infected M to produce IL-12 and nitric oxide (NO) and induce apoptosis in the infected cells and as such limit the replication of the intracellular bacteria. Inhibition of NK cell functions appears to be a common feature of viral infections in pigs. Mendoza [28] also found a similar characteristic of NK cells when mononuclear cells were cultured with African swine fever virus (ASFV). Similarly, porcine respiratory and reproduction syndrome virus infection affects the innate immune response of young pigs by inhibiting the function of peripheral blood NK cells [29] .",

The WC1 + subpopulation is further divided into WC1.1 + and WC1.2 + cells; however, the significance of this division is not yet clear. In addition this division relied on monoclonal antibody reactivity. Studies by Baldwin and colleagues [43] show that at least 13 genes located on chromosome 5 within two loci, encode the WC1 molecules. Extensive alternative splicing of transcripts of this family of genes is probably the reason we have a large diversity among this type of scavenger receptor.

These cells show a transiently activated phenotype characterized by increased expression of CD25, reduced expression of CD62L and CD45RO, and increased production of IFN\u2425. Most interestingly, WC1 + \u2425\u2426 T cells acquire NK-like capabilities to kill an in vitro target, shown by increased storage of perforin and expression of CD335. Data from these studies also indicated that bovine \u2425\u2426 T cells might act as antigen presenting cells due to increased expression of major histocompatibility class II molecule (MHC II) and CD13, and the ability to ingest and process exogenous proteins. Gamma delta T cells have been previously shown to act as antigen presenting cells [56] . Whether this activation indicates direct interaction of \u2425\u2426 T cells with virus or a bystander effect, is not yet known. Further studies should precisely define particular phenotypes responsible for both NK-like behavior and antigen presenting properties and particularly if these cells are able to activate CD4 + T cells in an antigen-dependent manner. Our data support the earlier findings of Amadori et al. [53, 54] and suggest an important role of \u2425\u2426 T cells in the innate immune response against FMDV. In cattle persistently infected with bovine leukemia virus (BLV), administration of recombinant IFN\u2425 increased the number of \u2425\u2426 T cells in circulation and suppressed the replication of BLV in vivo, although no mechanisms were suggested by these authors on how the \u2425\u2426 T cells eliminated the IgM + cells harboring the virus [57] .",

Stephens et al. [61] have described two DC populations CD172 + /CD13 \u2212 (SIRP + /CC18Ag \u2212 ) and CD172a \u2212 /CD13 + (SIRP \u2212 /CC18Ag + ), in afferent lymph of cattle. These two DC populations have different patterns of cytokine production. Of the two populations, CD13 + produced more IL-12, although prolonged stimulation of both populations produced comparable amounts of IL-12. The early response of the CD13 \u2212 cells was characterized by IL-10 secretion. However, both populations of DC did not produce type I interferon (IFN\u2423 or \u2424). It is difficult to assess what role these DC may play in innate immunity to vaccination or infection since the cytokine profile arising from prolonged stimulation appears to promote Th1 type (both cell types produced IL-12) of immune response, i.e., suited to activation of adaptive rather than innate immune responses. There is a level of plasticity retained in these DC populations that may allow them to stimulate either Th1 or Th2 responses depending on the conditions of the initial stimulatory signals or these subsets of DCs may be integral to one or the other T helper cell response. A firm conclusion in this paradigm awaits more definitive data.",

High levels of type I IFN were produced after stimulation of the cells with the TLR9 agonist CpG and FMDV immune complexes. Depletion of CD4 + cells in vivo reduced the level of type I IFN in the serum of animals following infection with FMDV. These data likely indicate that these pDCs may be critical in generating protective immunity in animals already vaccinated, because the production of type I IFN was dependent on the presence of FMDV-antibody complexes in in vivo experiments. Interestingly, mesenteric lymph nodes yielded DCs with particularly high capacity to produce type I IFN, suggesting a role for these cells in lymph nodes. However, the results reported in the study by Reid et al. [69] do not indicate a role for type I IFN in early phases of infection since no effect on clinical disease was observed following depletion of CD4 + type I IFN producing cells. Further, monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) complexed with dead virus stimulated FMDV-specific CD4 + memory T cells, suggesting a possibility that such complexes could be used to target FMDV in vaccine formulations [65] .",

            "text": "Lessons from the rodent models show that the innate immune system accomplishes activation and initiation of inflammatory responses through interaction of cellular components. DCs initiate the interaction upon encounter with the pathogen or upon receiving inflammatory signals from the periphery. They secrete cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18 that activate NK cells. This activation leads to increased proliferation, cytotoxicity and expression of NK cell receptors [77] that in turn may control the activation and maturation of DC. Also involved at this stage of activation are cytokines produced by NK cells such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u2423), interferon gamma (IFN\u2425) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that up-regulate expression of MHC I molecules on DC. Apparently, as part of DC-NK crosstalk, NK cells may lyse immature DC (iDC), most likely to limit the immune response or to protect from induction of tolerance towards pathogens, as reported in the mouse [78] . Most recently, Siddiqui and Hope [79] showed that bovine CD335 + /CD2 \u2212 NK cells migrate towards M. bovis infected DC that abundantly expressed chemokines such as CCL3, 4, 5, 20 and CXCL8. In this scenario, DCs produced IL-12 that activated NK cells to produce IFN\u2425, and in turn, CD335 + /CD2 \u2212 NK cells induced an increase in the intensity of MHC II expression on the DCs. This observation clearly demonstrates the interaction between DC and NK cells.",

The second possibility is the lymph node. In humans and mice, both DC and CD56 bright NK cells can express chemokine receptors such as chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 7 (CCR7) and chemokine (X-C motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3) [81, 82] , that are responsible for immune cell trafficking to lymph nodes. Thus NK cells and DCs are in close proximity for interactions that lead to activation [83] . Moreover, in humans NK cells secrete the high mobility group B1 (HMGB1) inflammatory cytokine that protects DC from lysis by NK cells. Further, DC secrete IL-18, a cytokine that is leaderless and hence restricted to the synaptic cleft, promoting cell-cell contact of NK and DC [84] .",

Surprisingly, this increased expression of TLR7 did not lead to enhanced type I IFN response in infected monocytes, suggesting that monocytes may play a minor role in overall synthesis of type I IFNs during infection with BVDV. The same authors had earlier shown that infection of macrophages with BVDV did not influence expression of TLR2, 3 and 4. Moreover, TLR signalling detected in these studies was not attributed to increases in TNF\u2423 or IL-1\u2424.

Studies by Zhang [94] indicate a role for the increased expression of TLR4, since mRNA level of type I IFNs concurrently increased. This may be surprising because FMDV is an RNA virus, more likely to provide ligands for TLR3 (dsRNA, a replication intermediate in many RNA viruses) than for TLR4 which transduces signals after recognizing LPS from Gram-positive bacteria. Fig. 1 . Possible interaction of DC, NK and \u2425\u2426 T cells in an innate immune response. The figure shows three major cellular components of the innate immune system. It appears that each of the cellular components might initiate innate responses individually. Mostly because all the cell types express TLR, hence are capable of sensing pathogens. DC, upon encounter with pathogens or receiving signals from the periphery through chemokines, produce cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18, which are important activators of NK cells. NK cells in turn respond by secreting more cytokines, particularly TNF\u2423, IFN\u2425, GM-CSF and HMGB1 that have a regulatory effect on DC and an activating effect on \u2425\u2426 T cells. Further, the NK cells proliferate in response to DC cytokines and enhance cytotoxicity against virus infected cells. In addition to cytokines secreted by NK cells \u2425\u2426 T cells also, secrete TNF\u2423 and GM-CSF that affect the DC activation leading to maturation and enhanced expression of MHC class I and II molecules and subsequent antigen presentation. The interplay depicted here account for the effective role played by these cells to counteract infection before it spreads within the host. However, the efficacy with which these mechanisms are executed remains largely unknown in large animal species, since viruses such as FMDV manage to efficiently replicate in swine and cause immunosuppression.",

The activation of these cells to enhanced killing is partially dependent on DCs, as removing the DCs resulted in low levels of cytotoxicity following treatment with TLR7/8 agonists [95] . Others have found TLR4, 5, 7 and 9 expressed by MoDCs [96, 97] . In swine, an interferon response to the TLR9 agonist, CpG, was detected in plasmacytoid DCs, Langerhans cells and B cells [98] . Zhang et al. [99] reported that swine TLR7 is stimulated by RNA oligonucleotides found in FMDV leading to expression of IFN\u2423 and Th1 cytokine induction. Taken together, this leads to the possibility of targeting these TLRs in order to modulate the function of innate immune cells to fight viral infections.",

TLRs are expressed either on the cell surface or in endosomes, but RLRs are found in the cytoplasm and may more be suited to detecting virus nucleic acids. Husser et al. [100] found that in PK-15 cells (porcine kidney cell line), FMDV is detected by MDA-5, while classical swine fever virus was detected by MDA-5, RIG-I and TLR3 which led to induction of IFN-\u2424. The evidence that FMDV preferentially signals through MDA-5 is supported by data from Wang et al. [101] that L pro of FMDV, a shorter form of L pro (Leader protease), significantly inhibits ubiquitination of RIG-I, likely leading to inhibition of type I IFNs induction.",

A minimal amount of research has been performed to understand mechanisms of innate immune responses that possibly contribute to early responses to FMDV. In our studies as well as studies by Salt and colleagues, and Summerfield and colleagues [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] , it is clearly demonstrated that early protection is achieved amidst very little antibody production. These data indicate that other mechanisms besides humoral immunity are in play at early time points of infection. We have recently shown that infection with FMDV in cattle induces a rapid although transient activation of \u2425\u2426 T cells [55] . Notably, the activation of the innate immune system in the cattle following FMDV infection is the opposite result from what we have reported in swine. Within 24 h following inoculation of pigs with FMDV, DCs stop secreting type I IFN and their numbers are reduced [108, 109] . Further, NK cells isolated from FMDV infected pigs 24-96 h after infection do not produce IFN\u2425 and fail to spontaneously lyse target cells in vitro [36] , all indicating that the swine innate response is inhibited by the virus.",

Additionally, the initial, high IFN\u2423 production is curtailed abruptly leading to high levels of viraemia and subsequent lymphopenia. A combination of these two factors may lead to immunosuppression of these innate responses in pigs. Conversely, although vireamia is observed in cattle, levels of IFN\u2423 are much lower than those in pigs and neither lymphopenia nor immunosuppression of NK cells or \u2425\u2426 T cells occurs in cattle [110] . Taken together, a new emphasis is required to focus investigations on the innate immune mechanisms that may be exploited in design of new interventions to control FMDV outbreaks.",
