Traditional microbiologic data has provided insight into the role of infections in BOS. Now, new non-culturebased techniques have been developed to characterize the entire population of microbes resident on the surfaces of the body, also known as the human microbiome. Early studies have identified that lung transplant patients have a different lung microbiome and have demonstrated the important finding that the transplant lung microbiome changes over time. Furthermore, both unique bacterial populations and longitudinal changes in the lung microbiome have now been suggested to play a role in the development of BOS. In the future, this technology will need to be combined with functional assays and assessment of the immune responses in the lung to help further explain the microbiome's role in the failing lung allograft.",

            "text": "Lung transplantation is an increasingly common procedure to treat intractable, end-stage lung disease in appropriate patients. In 2011, 3,640 lung transplants were performed, representing the largest number in any given year [1] [2] [3] . Transplantation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and cystic fibrosis (CF) accounts for nearly 75% of the procedures [1] . Despite this growth, lung transplantation remains limited by a high mortality rate relative to other solid organ transplants. The median reported survival was just 5.6 years in the Thirtieth Official Lung and Heart-Lung Transplant report of the Registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, released in 2013. The majority of mortality within the first year after transplant is due to infection. In contrast, late mortality in lung transplantation is largely due to chronic rejection manifested as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) [1] . Improvement in survival in lung transplantation over time has been largely due to improvements in early mortality without significant change in the development of BOS over time [4] . With this in mind, a breakthrough is needed in prevention of BOS to provide meaningful and substantial impact on long-term survival after lung transplant.",

Recently, non-culture based techniques have been developed that utilize high-throughput DNA sequencing to broadly characterize the microbiome, the community of bacteria that occupies the surfaces of the human body [14, 15] . With these techniques, entire populations of bacteria can be characterized where traditional cultures may have appeared sterile. As such, the role of commensal organisms, dysbiosis, and bacterial colonization on disease states such as BOS can be better established. Research into the microbiome and lung disease is in its early stages and has begun to be applied to lung transplantation, where the potential impact of microbiota on the allograft is compelling.",

Bacteria contain the highly conserved 16S rRNA gene known, which, when amplified and sequenced, can be used to identify resident bacteria by comparison to databases of known sequences [16] . In addition, functional metagenomic analysis may be performed to identify which biological tasks may be performed by microbial communities (Figure 1 ) [15] . The amplification of 16S RNA gene, harnessed in much of the bacterial microbiome work to date, allows bacterial sequences to be selected from samples also containing eukaryotic DNA. Further techniques are available to evaluate the \"fungome\" and \"virome\", but as these techniques are less developed, little has been published with regard to lung disease.

Different sampling techniques as well as novel statistical analysis have been used to address this challenge [20, 21] . Furthermore, the lung microbiome may not be uniform, as suggested by studies in COPD demonstrating regional heterogeneity in microbial populations [22] . The majority of published studies have utilized bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), which may not reflect segmental variation in the airway microbiome. In addition, low biomass of microorganisms results in low yield of bacteria for sequencing [23] and, therefore, increased importance (or interference) of background and environmental bacteria such as can be detected in sampling equipment and reagents [20, 21] . Finally, the sequences obtained may reflect dead bacteria [24] .

Transplanted patients had overall higher bacterial load in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). While the BALF of healthy patients had a microbial content that mirrored the oral flora, a subset of lung transplant recipients (three with CF, one with IPF) had BALF that was dominated by other organisms, namely Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, or Achromobacter, which were also demonstrated on traditional culture. In contrast, one subject with late BOS had BALF dominated by Sneathia, which was unable to be cultured [44] .

Luna et al also demonstrated temporal changes in bacterial diversity, with diversity increasing until 9 months and then decreasing between 9 and 12 months [45] . Further, Willner et al [47] undertook \"holistic\" sampling at multiple body sites in lung transplant recipients, using BALF, lung tissue, nasopharyngeal, oral, and rectal swabs. BALF samples were strongly affected by antibiotic pressure with a gradual and significant decrease in Shannon diversity index. Willner and colleagues separately showed that 16 lung transplant recipients with CF (six with BOS) demonstrated a dynamic microbiota over time. Antibiotic pressure played an important role in the dynamics of the microbiome, and impacted the presence of Pseudomonas [38] . Notably, these investigations have largely found that the microbiome of the allograft is dynamic. While antibiotics are one important factor, other influences have not yet been identified.",

In this model, Pseudomonas clinical infection increased the risk of developing new BOS and of death prior to the development of BOS. In patients who had elevated BAL fluid chemokines and Pseudomonas infection, this risk was further amplified. In addition, once the diagnosis of BOS was established, both Pseudomonas infection and colonization led to increased risk of death [8] .",

Patients with CF with BOS had nontypical pathogens, including Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Neisseria, and Haemophilus. CF patients without BOS were more likely to demonstrate Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, and Staphylococcus. In the non-CF population, patients with BOS demonstrated a shift in population from \"normal respiratory flora\" to new pathogens including Pseudomonas, Burkholderia and Staphylococcus [38] . These results imply that the relationship between pre-and post-transplant microbiota may impact the development of BOS.

Given that the upper airway is the likely reservoir of Pseudomonas in cystic fibrosis, Vital et al performed endoscopic frontal-spheno-ethoidectomy in the majority of patients with CF who underwent lung transplantation. The goal was to treat bacterial colonization of the sinuses immediately post transplantation. Of 66 patients who had Pseudomonas airway colonization pretransplant, 65% of patients (38% pulmonary colonization, 27% nasal colonization only) had persistent colonization after transplantation despite a trial of eradication with multiple antibiotics active against Pseudomonas. Compared to patients with persistent Pseudomonas airway colonization, those patients without Pseudomonas had improved 5-year survival, and a decreased incidence of BOS. Patients with Pseudomonas were also more likely to have neutrophilic alveolitis, an indication that the presence of Pseudomonas leads to airway inflammation and immune activation [31] . This study, a window into potential therapeutic use of microbiome studies, demonstrated both the difficulty in eradicating some bacterial inhabitants and the importance of pre-transplant microbiota on the post-transplant allograft.",

The mechanism of azithromycin in this setting is uncertain and may be due to its immunomodulatory role [54] . An alternative explanation is that the antibiotic properties of azithromycin may alter the lung microbiota in a beneficial way. A systematic evaluation of azithromycin on the allograft microbiome has not been done, but in one instance, Moraxella was decreased after treatment with azithromycin [38].

In a retrospective cohort study of 259 consecutive adult lung transplant patients, 21 community-acquired upper or lower respiratory viral illnesses were identified including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, influenza, and adenovirus. The group with viral infection was more likely to develop BOS, death, and death-from-BOS, with lower respiratory tract infections enhancing risk [10] . In a subsequent prospective single-center study, 388 lung transplant recipients at various times post-transplant were screened by nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for 12 different community-acquired respiratory viruses. Thirty-four viruses were detected in 30 patients, including parainfluenza, RSV, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and influenza. In patients in whom a virus was detected, the one-year incidence of new BOS was 25% compared to 9% in virus-negative patients (P=0.01) [7] . Influenza pneumonia has also been associated with progressive loss of lung function [55] as well as the risk of graft dysfunction in lung transplant recipients [56] . Similarly, a prospective evaluation by Kumar et al showed that in 93 transplant recipients, a respiratory virus was documented in 51.6% of patients on at least one BAL. Acute rejection or decline in FEV 1 occurred within three months in 33% of patients who had a documented respiratory virus compared with 6.7% of those without a respiratory viral infection. Chronic rejection defined as obliterative bronchiolitis histologically or clinical BOS was diagnosed in 62.5% of patients within 1 year of infection [57] . RSV infection has also been associated with the onset of rapid development of BOS [9] . Other viruses implicated in BOS have been HHV-6 [61] and EBV [58] . Thus, viral infections and their interaction with other microbial communities will be an important target as research expands into this realm. [59] , CMV replication in the allograft [60] , and treatment for CMV pneumonitis within the first six months after transplant [13] have all been associated with increased risk of BOS. Further, Fiser et al found CMV to be a risk factor for progression of BOS [61] . In contrast to these studies, other literature has found that CMV detection in bronchoalveolar lavage [62] and histologically diagnosed CMV pneumonia treated with ganciclovir [63] had no relationship to the subsequent development of BOS or survival. Likewise, the presence of beta-herpesviruses including CMV and human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 and -7) have been associated with acute rejection but not with the development of BOS [64] . Despite these conflicting results, prophylaxis against CMV has been associated with decreased risk of BOS and survival [65] [66] . Thus, the role of this specific viral infection remains unclear. It is unknown whether the presence of other baseline microbial communities explains the variance in these studies.",

            "text": "The upper airway microbiome is connected to the lung microbiome-The upper airway microbiome, including residents of the nasopharynx and oropharynx, are likely an important reservoir for the lung microbiome. Willner et al also noted that all transplanted patients and controls shared a background lung microbiome characterized by oral and upper respiratory tract flora, including Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Prevotella [49] . Important supporting evidence for this has come from topographical sampling of the respiratory tract in both healthy patients and those with lung disease, including transplanted lungs [20, 38, 44] . Charlson and colleagues evaluated oral microbiota in additional to that in BALF, and found that each subject's BALF remained more closely linked to his or her own oral wash than to other patients; the divergence between oral wash and BALF was strongest in transplant patients [44] . Likewise, Willner et al also determined that changes in BALF communities were mirrored by changes in the nasopharyngeal communities [38] . In contrast, Charlson et al found that in normal lungs, the nasopharyngeal community appeared distinct from the lower respiratory tract [20] . Oral microbiota were largely unchanged in patients immediately after transplantation, with the majority of organisms from the expected genera Streptococcus and Veillonella. Patients who developed respiratory signs and symptoms had the most notable shifts in oral microbiota populations. It is unclear if the respiratory infection and subsequent antibiotic treatment led to the shift in the oral microbiome or if the microbiome predisposed to the respiratory symptoms [68] . Likewise, the oral microbiome of pediatric liver transplant patients was shown to initially change at 3 days but then revert to a pre-transplant state by 100 days [69] . In contrast, the oral microbiome late after transplant may be altered. Diaz et al found that the oral microbiome differed between recipients of renal or cardiac transplant over one year post-transplant compared with non-transplant controls. Transplanted patients were more likely to have bacteria in phyla Gammaproteobacteria (Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Vibrio, Enterobacteriacea) and the presence of these organisms was positively correlated with the doses of prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil [70] . These studies suggest that the oral microbiota is a dynamic entity that may change due to post transplant immunosuppression, antibiotics and other clinical factors associated with transplant. The impact of the oral microbiota on the lung microbiota is still unclear.",

Recipients of small bowel transplantation have been found have shifts in the ileostomy microbiota that is directly related to increased exposure to oxygen in the environment [72] , a finding that emphasizes the role of anatomic microenvironments that may also occur in lung transplantation and diseased lungs. Animal and human studies in cirrhosis have demonstrated stool dysbiosis associated with underlying cirrhosis that then normalized after transplantation [73, 74] , highlighting the potential importance of the underlying disease on the state of the microbiome. Finally, studies in both liver and small bowel have demonstrated a potential clinical correlate of rejection associated with disrupted microbiota. Oh et al found that the bacterial fingerprints in ileal effluents could distinguish between rejecting and non-rejecting recipients of small bowel transplantation [75] . In murine studies of liver transplantation, acute rejection has been associated with alteration in gut microbiota [76] while microbial-associated molecule patterns may lead to increased susceptibility to liver preservation or reperfusion injury after transplantation [77] . Whether similar patterns could become a predictive tool or treatment target in lung transplantation remains to be seen.",

With that in mind, lung transplant has tremendous promise to be an early area of advancement in the understanding of the lung allograft microbiome. Current data suggest that the lung transplant microbiome differs from \"healthy\" lung microbiome. In addition, while the majority of studies suggest that the lung transplant microbiome has decreased diversity and richness, some suggest that there is no difference in diversity. Importantly, longitudinal changes in bacterial flora have been described, raising the question of whether change in microbiota over time is of more importance than individual pathogens in the development of BOS.

Microbiome studies must be linked to assessments of innate and adaptive immune function within the lung allograft. Metabolic products of lung microbial communities must be identified to determine their role in disease development. Assessment of the microbiome may ultimately be used as a predictor for patients at risk for rejection/ BOS and may provide therapeutic targets.
