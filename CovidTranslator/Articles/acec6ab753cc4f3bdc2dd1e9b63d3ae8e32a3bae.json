We investigated 18 autopsies of patients who had suspected SARS; 8 cases were confirmed as SARS. We evaluated white blood cells from 22 confirmed SARS patients at various stages of the disease. T lymphocyte counts in 65 confirmed and 35 misdiagnosed SARS cases also were analyzed retrospectively. SARS viral particles and genomic sequence were detected in a large number of circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, and lymphoid tissues, as well as in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, the mucosa of the intestine, the epithelium of the renal distal tubules, the neurons of the brain, and macrophages in different organs. SARS virus seemed to be capable of infecting multiple cell types in several organs; immune cells and pulmonary epithelium were identified as the main sites of injury. A comprehensive theory of pathogenesis is proposed for SARS with immune and lung damage as key features.",

We also investigated the immune cell lesion in 100 patients who had suspected SARS who were admitted to our hospitals; 35 were found retrospectively to have been misdiagnosed. We set out to verify a hypothesis of immune cell injury-based damage for the pathogenesis of SARS. Analysis of our newly obtained histologic and molecular data, and clinical information revealed a more complete picture of the infection. RESULTS 8 of the 18 suspected SARS victims were confirmed as having SARS by demonstration of the pathogen with real-time RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and electron microscopy (EM). All cases had similar pathologic changes in their lungs, immune system, and other organs. Differences in the severity of pathologic changes were noted among SARS cases, which varied with the duration of the disease before death. The examination of the blood samples from patients who had early-stage SARS provided insights into the pathologic changes at the early phase of the disease. Dis-tinct differences in lymphocyte counts between confirmed and misdiagnosed cases also were demonstrated. These are reported in the following text.",

There was extensive alveolar collapse, and the remaining alveoli were filled with fluid and desquamated alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells. Alveolar epithelial hyperplasia was evident. Large syncytial cells with multiple nuclei were present. Small vessel vasculitis was seen.

Negative control for in situ hybridization of SARS genomic sequence of the lung showed no positive signal when an unrelated probe was used ( Fig. 1 F) . EM demonstrated SARS-like viral particles in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells (Fig. 1 , H and I). In situ hybridization with specific probes, and colloid gold-labeled secondary antibodies detected specific positive signals in the cytoplasm of epithelial cell types I and II at the EM level ( Fig. 1 G) .

The percentage of total circulating lymphocytes was decreased (Table I) . The percentages of different cell types that harbored SARS-like viral particles are shown in Table II . Positive samples included those taken within 10 d of the onset of fever, and in one instance as early as 3 d. Most of the infected cells were T cells. Some B cells and NK cells also were infected by the virus. By EM, the viral particles tended to form clusters and were located within or near the endoplasmic reticulum. T lymphocytes were identified by their unique morphology with a size of \u202b\u0641\u202c 8-15 m in diameter; round shape with irregular cell membranes and small villous processes; large rounded, but sometimes, irregular nucleus; and small quantities of cytoplasm devoid of lysosomes. Labeling of these cells with antibody to CD3 and pre-embedding immunoperoxidase labeling for EM further confirmed the nature of these cells. The macrophages appeared to be activated as they became slightly larger. The nature of these cells was confirmed with immunohistochemistry of CD68.",

The presence and localization of the virus in these target cells were confirmed by in situ hybridization, EM, and real-time PCR. It is evident that infection by the SARS virus is not confined to the lungs, but also involves other parts of the respiratory tract and other organ systems, most importantly immune cells, particularly the T lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. The finding of early and consistent decreases of T lymphocytes in 65 patients who had SARS, but not in the 35 misdiagnosed patients, further suggests that lympho- cyte damage is the hallmark of SARS. Administration of glucocorticoids contributed to a decrease in lymphocyte counts in both groups of patients; however, the difference in counts between the two groups persisted after glucocorticoid therapy. It was reported that lymphopenia is one of the earliest changes, and is a reliable prognostic predictor in SARS (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . An extensive literature search has not revealed a report of any other type of pneumonitis producing such severe lymphopenia. As the only logical explanation for the early and consistent lymphopenia that is demonstrated in patients who have SARS, we suggest that lymphocytes-particularly T lymphocytes-are infected and destroyed by the virus or by other immune cells. Our study provides evidence of infection and destruction of lymphocytes in the spleen, lymph nodes, and lymphoid tissues of the gut. In these sites lymphocytes were reduced markedly, germinal centers were depleted of lymphocytes, and in situ hybridization detected SARS viral positivity in the residual immune cells in the spleen and in circulation. This destruction of lymphocytes would cause an acute immunodeficiency that would aggravate the infection of the respiratory tract. The markedly weakened immune system at the early and mid stages of the disease is likely to be the reason for the acute nature and severity of the respiratory syndrome in SARS viral infection.",

The release of respiratory symptoms following steroid treatment (19) could be attributed to the antiinflammatory effect of the therapies, rather than immune suppression. Although the role of immune hyperreaction, particularly in the early phase of the diseases, could not be ruled out completely, the evidence that we obtained points more to a direct immune injury as an important component in SARS pathology and pathogenesis.",

The SARS virus enters the body through the respiratory tract and first infects the epithelial cells of the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs. The virus infects resident, infiltrating, and circulating immune cells. The circulating immune cells carry the virus to other organs. The virus infects and damages the immune cells of the spleen, peripheral and central lymph nodes, and other lymphoid tissues. The immune defense is weakened significantly, which leads to rapid deterioration of the pneumonia. In the same manner, the blood-borne SARS virus infects other organs. As such, patients who have compromised immune function, such as those who have chronic diseases and aged individuals, suffer a more severe illness and have a much higher mortality from SARS (15) . The extent of immune cell damage, reflected by lymphocyte count, is a manifestation of the patient's immune status and a predictor of outcome. The damage to the immune system, more than damage to the lungs, determines whether a patient recovers or dies from the infection. In a way, the name \"sudden acute respiratory syndrome\" is inappropriate because it diverts attention from the primary pathologic changes that result from SARS virus infection. It must be emphasized that immune damage most likely is the primary determinant of clinical outcome.",

Our proposed mechanism of infection and dissemination is capable of explaining all of the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings that have been reported for SARS. It provides a comprehensive theory of pathogenesis for this new disease. In a way, SARS infection is similar to HIV infection that causes AIDS. Although HIV attacks and destroys the target cells slowly, particularly lymphocytes (24) , SARS virus infects and destroys the immune cells in a much faster and more devastating fashion. Like many other infectious diseases, SARS infections show differing degrees of severity in different individuals. Only the most severe cases demonstrate the full range of pathologic changes that was described above. Our findings suggest that body fluid and fecal-respiratory tract transmission of the virus, although not reported, is possible because SARS viruses or its sequences are detectable in the blood, intestines, stool, and urine. A correct understanding of the pathogenesis is crucial for developing animal models to test effective vaccines and to establish techniques for early diagnosis.

The in situ hybridization reaction was performed on formalinfixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections with the SARS probe at 50 g/ ml. The hybridization cocktail was incubated at 55\u040aC for 16 h. The alkaline phosphatase-labeled antidigoxigenin antibody (1:500) was incubated for 60 min, and colorization was achieved with nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and counterstained with methyl-green.

The in situ hybridization signal was visualized with alkaline phosphatase, which results in a dark blue color, whereas positive immunostaining signal was visualized with diamenobenzodin, which gives a reddishbrown color. When the two signals are present in the same cell, the staining changes to a purplish color, which is easily distinguishable from either of the primary colors. In addition, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were performed separately on consecutive sections to analyze the relationship between in situ hybridization signals and immunostaining signals to ascertain the cell types that were infected by the virus. Seven cell marker antigens were examined to identify epithelial cells, macrophages, T cells, B cells, and splenic dendritic cells. The specificities and the sources of these antibodies are shown in Table III .",

Blood samples from 4 patients who did not have SARS were examined as controls. 100 white blood cells per patient were examined with a transmission electron microscope (Jeol -JEM-100CX II) operating at 100 kW.In addition, the lymphocyte counts from 65 patients who had confirmed SARS-50 of whom were treated with steroids (glucocorticoid 30 g/kg) and the other 15 were not treated-and 35 patients who had misdiagnosed cases-20 of whom were treated with steroids and the other 15 were not treated-were analyzed retrospectively. The identification of confirmed and misdiagnosed cases was achieved by the SARS antibody test described above.The study was approved by the Institutional Scientific and Ethics Committee of the Health Science Center, Peking University.We are grateful to all of the front-line physicians and health care workers who cared for the patients, performed tests, and collected data for this study. We are indebted to our colleagues who were infected by the virus while performing their duties. Two lost their lives, and this article is dedicated to them. We also thank all members of the pathogenesis study team, some of whom risked SARS infection in performing the autopsies and collecting the samples.This study was supported by grants from Peking University and the Ministry of Science and Technology, P.R. China entitled \"Histopathology, tissue collection and the pathogenesis of SARS\" (2003AA208105) and \"Pathogenesis and clinical pathology of SARS\" (2003AA208107).The authors have no conflicting financial interests.
