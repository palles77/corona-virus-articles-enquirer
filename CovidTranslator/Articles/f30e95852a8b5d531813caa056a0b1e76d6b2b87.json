Cidofovir (HPMPC) is used to treat herpesvi-rus infections, mainly cytomegalovirus (CMV), when resistance to first-line therapy occurs. Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) was licensed to treat hepatitis B. But there is one drug which stands out as being exceptional. Tenofovir, as its oral prodrug, was approved for HIV therapy in 2001 and, in combination with emtricitabine (FTC) as Truvada, was approved in 2004. Atripla (combination of Truvada and efavirenz) was approved in 2006. Complera (in USA) [and Eviplera (in Europe) ] was approved in 2011, and the ''Quad pill'' Stribild (containing Truvada, elvitegravir and cobicistat) was approved in 2012 (in USA) and 2013 (in Europe).

Like Tony and Erik, John has had a long and close association with ISAR. Tony Hol\u00fd was born in 1936. He synthesized his first nucleotide, (S)-DHPA in 1968, published in Science in 1978 and it was approved in Czechoslovakia as Duvira \u00d2 gel. The first phosphonate, (S)-HPMPA was published in Nature in 1986. Although this compound was not progressed into a clinical drug, it led to cidofovir, approved in 1996 for the treatment of CMV retinitis in AIDS patients, and adefovir (PMEA) approved for therapy of hepatitis B. Ultimately, it was tenofovir that was to become a major success for treating HIV-infected patients. From its first introduction in 2001, its market share has increased to well over 40%. In 2002, the ''Hol\u00fd trinity'' started thinking about a single-pill regimen. This led to Atripla being approved in 2006, Complera in 2011 and Stribild in 2012.",

Both Tony and Erik waived their royalties for sales in countries with poor access to health care. Tenofovir, in its various forms, is now available in over 130 countries and is distributed widely to the known HIVinfected patients. It is thought that this improved access to effective therapy has contributed to a marked reduction in HIV transmission, at least in part due to people being more willing to be tested for HIV, knowing that there is a good therapy available.",

TDF was comparable to d4T-containing combination for efficacy but it had fewer side effects. Compared to AZT, TDF was both more efficacious and had a better safety profile. Over 144 weeks, d4T therapy gave marked side effects, especially mitochondrial toxicity which was not a feature of treatment with TDF. As noted above, the next step was to combine TDF with emtricitabine (FTC), known as Truvada \u00d2 , (licensed 2004) . In a ground-breaking move, Gilead and BMS cooperated to simplify HIV therapy by combining three drugs into a single pill (Truvada with efavirenz) to form a single, once-a-day pill, Atripla \u00d2 (licensed 2006). By 2012, tenofovir was being used worldwide to treat 3.5 million HIV-infected patients, about 44% of all HIV patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Many of them are part of the expanded access in developing countries. As an example of the impact of these initiatives, life expectancy has increased by about ten years in regions of rural Sub-Saharan Africa. Some patients have been taking tenofovir for 12 years.",

In the USA, the rate of new infections has remained at $50,000/ year since 1991. In part, there continue to be so many new infections because half of new transmissions happen during the acute phase of HIV infection, before patients know their HIV-infection status.

Truvada (FTC/TDF) is being evaluated as it is once-daily dosing, has a good degree of ''forgiveness'' for missed doses and drug resistance may occur, but only rarely and at a high cost to the viral replication capacity. A clinical trial, with prophylactic dosing, (PrEP) revealed many problems, mainly due to poor adherence. In men who have sex with men (MSM), there was better efficacy than in women, but the adherence rates in women were low (from 35% to only 20%). One factor may have been the very long consent forms, which included 7 pages of potential side effects. With so many missed doses, intention-to-treat analyses become rather meaningless, so the analyses focused on outcomes relative to the amount of drug taken. Most (93%) of new infections were in subjects with no detectable drug. In contrast, it seems that there were no seroconversions in subjects taking the drug daily. Comparing subjects taking 2, 4 or 7 tablets per week, the risk of transmission increased with fewer doses per week but even two doses per week gave a slight reduction in transmission risk.",

These include agents for the treatment of infections with HIV, hepatitis B and herpesviruses. The discussion of future opportunities included new drug development against HIV, HBV, and other DNA viruses. For HIV infection, a new prodrug for tenofovir (TFV), tenofovir alafenamide (GS-7340, TAF) is currently in Phase III development. In comparison with TDF, TAF delivers higher levels of TFV diphosphate into PBMCs at much lower doses. TAF is being tested as a part of new single tablet regimen containing TAF, FTC, elvitegravir and a pharmacoenhancer cobicistat. In Phase II, the efficacy of the combination was similar to that of the recently approved Stribild \u00d2 , with a trend toward less impact on bone and renal parameters. CMX-157, a phospholipid-based prodrug of TFV is currently in Phase 1. In healthy subjects, CMX-157 showed promising levels of parent TFV and its active metabolite in PBMCs.",

Unlike the parent drug cidofovir, CMX001 is administered orally and exhibits substantially improved safety profile than the parent compound. CMX001 (100 mg twice weekly) is being tested in Phase III trials in immunocompromised patients. The recently described anti-herpesvirus activity of tenofovir was also discussed. Although tenofovir has much less activity against HSV than HIV, clinical data suggested that the use of topical gel gives sufficiently high drug levels to reduce HSV-2 transmission. Tenofovir topical gel is being tested for the prophylaxis of HSV-2 transmission. A large Phase III study (FACTS-001) is currently in progress in Africa.",

Soon, he was collaborating with Erik, discovering the potent activity of BVDU and BVara U against VZV, and this led to his time as a postdoc at Leuven from 1986 to 1989. His close colleagues were Rudi Pauwels, Jan Balzarini and Dominique Schols. The group was investigating the HIV activity of a new class of compounds, phosphonyl purine derivatives. His first paper included Tony Hol\u00fd as a co-author. They discovered the anti-HIV activity of PMEA (adefovir) which was followed later by PMPA (tenofovir). This group developed a rapid and efficient assay to test compounds. The paper ''Rapid and automated tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay for the detection of Testing compounds led to the surprising discovery of the 6substituted uracil derivative HEPT which had good activity against HIV-1 but was totally inactive against HIV-2. The compound was shown to be an inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) through an allosteric mode of action. A number of HEPT derivatives were synthesized by Mistubishi Chemical Corp. (Japan) and the optimized compound (MKC-442, emivirine) was developed by Triangle Pharmaceuticals (USA) but further development was halted in 2002 after comparing emivirine with abacavir in a Phase III trial.",

As an example, HIV-1 gp120-NPs were administered to mice intranasally and shown to promote a strong cellular immune response. In summarizing the progress so far, antigen-NPs are taken up by dendritic cells and also induce their maturation. In mice, they induce potent cellular and humoral immunity. The NPs themselves do not have any antigenicity and they appear to be safer than alum or other experimental adjuvants.

Progress so far: NAOMI is fast, with good accuracy, and it is fully automated, but questions remain. Are there more enzymes to include and is a compound a substrate or an inhibitor? Another potential HCV target is the helicase. It has a nucleoside-TP binding site, a long channel for holding the dsRNA and possible allosteric sites.

To prevent cellular 5 0 -3 0 nucleases from degrading the viral genomic RNA and to allow the viral RNA to bind to host ribosomes, the virus has to acquire a cap. Essentially this can be done in one of three ways: to create a cap using viral enzymes, to steal a cap from a host RNA molecule or to use the host capping process in the nucleus.

A Phase I PK study evaluated doses from 25 mg to 1000 mg. ACH-3102 has a long plasma half-life (T \u00bd ) of about 250 h or 10 days. It is active against all genotypes and strains resistant to earlier NS5A inhibitors. It appears to have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Single doses from 25 to 300 mg gave about a 4 log 10 reduction in viral load, but there was no real dose response. In a Phase IIa trial (n = 8), ACH-3102 was administered with RBV. As this drug has such a long T \u00bd , a loading dose (225 mg) was given on day 1 and 75 mg given once daily thereafter.

There are two general considerations: the ligand competes with water for the receptor and H-bonds need order. This latter requirement may mean that the formation of Hbond(s) can be at the cost of reduced entropy for a protein with a high degree of flexibility (i.e. high entropy). For H-bonds, the range is from \u00c08 for strong bonds to about \u00c02 or \u00c01 for weaker bonds. Much stronger (about double) bonds are formed if an NH 4 + group is attached to an aromatic ring. Halogen bonding is usually in the range \u00c02 to \u00c01 but can be \u00c03 when attached to an electron-deficient ring. Several other types of interaction are in the range \u00c02",

Although EC 50 values were about 500 lM, 16 fragments were identified as hits.

            "text": "It is commonly thought that an increase in lipophilicity will decrease water solubility. In a study of many drugs, comparing water solubility with lipophilicity, the correlation coefficient (R) was 0.54, implying that other factor(s) must play a role. Sometimes, adding a highly polar group can help. For example, adding a phosphate to amprenavir (fosamprenavir) gave improved water solubility. Because the phosphate group is removed enzymatically at the surface of the intestine, the more lipophilic parent compound is easily absorbed. Other examples illustrated that phosphates, which are too stable, may give water solubility, but may not increase absorption. Highly crystalline, high melting-point solids have too much lattice energy for water to solvate the crystal. For example, adding an ethyl group greatly increased water solubility by reducing the lattice energy.",

Valacyclovir, a prodrug of acyclovir, works so well because it not only improves the physical properties, but also utilizes a cellular carrier system. Cidofovir (CDV) is concentrated in the kidneys by organic anion transporters and this leads to nephrotoxicity. In the Elion Award lecture at ICAR 2012, Karl Hostetler described how he tried to mimic lysolecithin in order to utilize lipid transport pathways and thereby avoid the nephrotoxicity associated with CDV. Randall Lanier of Chimerix Inc., Durham, NC, USA gave some of the improved properties of hexadecyloxypropyl-CDV (CMX001) and some recent clinical results. PK studies confirmed that there is essentially no CDV in plasma from a CMX001 dose. This explains the lack of nephrotoxicity. It is thought that the mono-lipophilic chain, rather than a bi-chain, allows better passage through the cell wall by the molecule flipping over within the lipid bilayer. CDV is released only within the cell. By using the prodrug, intracellular levels of CDV-DP are about 350-fold greater than those from CDV.",

            "text": "In a current expanded access protocol (study 350, n = 210), about 1/3 of the patients are children and 2/3 are adults. Most have either adenovirus (ADV) or CMV infections, but some have dual infection. With ADV, most patients have responded well with a >1 log 10 reduction in viral load and may reach undetectable levels. In a phase II trial in CMV patients, CMX001 at 100 mg twice weekly is the optimum dose. Treatment starts when CMV DNA levels ex-ceed 1000 copies/ml. Patients who have prior mutant strains resistant to CDV do not respond as well as treatment-na\u00efve patients. However, even in the ''failure'' cases, the viral load often remained below 1000 copies/ml, in contrast to placebo-treated patients whose viral load increased well over 1000 copies/ml. An HIV attachment inhibitor, with very low water solubility, was partially absorbed, but the oral AUC remained virtually unchanged with dose. Encouraged by the Sundeep and Valentino paper, John Kadow of Bristol-Myers Squibb, Wallingford, CT, USA reported on using a phosphate prodrug. PK properties were much improved, AUC both much higher and with a dose response. Bioavailability was unchanged by food. However, the T\u00bd was so short that the duration of plasma concentrations above the EC 90 values was less than 12 h. A radio-controlled capsule was used to investigate the effects of drug release in different parts of the intestinal tract. This led the team to use a slow-release formulation of the prodrug. This is an example in which both prodrug and formulation approaches were used together.",

New data were shown for GS9131. In a Phase I trial, the PK of doses 10 and 30 mg without food and 30 mg with food were investigated. In PBMCs, the levels of the active moiety (TFV-DP) were 3-and 10-fold higher respectively than from the 300 mg dose of TDF.

All have the advantage that the active moiety is a nucleotide-triphosphate analog targeting the HCV polymerase (NS5B) which is highly conserved across all genotypes. The prodrug approach has been used extensively, not just to aid oral absorption, but it has also been useful to take advantage of a transporter system and to give liver targeting. The nucleoside analogs have all needed high drug levels. The greatest progress has been made with nucleotide analogs. Sofosbuvir (GS7977, PSI-7977) (400 mg once daily for 14 days) gave a 5 log 10 reduction in HCV RNA levels. When combined with RBV, the SVR was 78%. Even better, the combination of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir (BMS790052, NS5A inhibitor) gave 100% SVR. Sofosbuvir has been combined with ledipasvir (GS5885, NS5A inhibitor) as a single pill and is now starting Phase III trials. Sofosbuvir is likely to be the first anti-HCV nucleotide analog to reach the marketplace.",

The keynote address, the plenary lecture, the clinical symposium and the mini-symposia gave a good overview of progress in the area of antiviral research. Those presentations reporting clinical results are a vital part of ICAR meetings because beautiful research science needs to lead to useful drugs. The clinical symposium proved that antiviral chemotherapy is continuing to make important new progress although the areas of progress seem to vary from year to year. This year, there were fewer reports on HBV than last year. In contrast, the encouraging progress with HCV therapies was maintained. There is the prospect that the first nucleotide analog will be licensed by the time of our next ICAR meeting. The combination of a nucleotide analog and a NS5A inhibitor looks set to transform HCV therapy across all genotypes. As for HIV, single-pill, once-daily regimens are following on quickly. The established HCV protease inhibitors may become little used. As always, there are drug casualties -the HCV polymerase inhibitor IDX184 was progressing well last year, but development was stopped due to cardiotoxicity concerns relating to another drug with a similar structure.",

Last year, there were encouraging reports on a herpesvirus helicase/primase inhibitor, AIC-316, but there were no updates this year. Since ICAR, the clinicaltrials.gov site has been updated with the statement ''clinical hold due to non-clinical studies.'' Valganciclovir has long been the key therapy for CMV infections but now CMX001 is continuing to show promise in Phase II trials. The therapy of HIV-infected patients has already been transformed by the introduction of single-pill, once-daily regiments and now the choice of such regimens has expanded with Quad \u00d2 becoming a licensed drug.
