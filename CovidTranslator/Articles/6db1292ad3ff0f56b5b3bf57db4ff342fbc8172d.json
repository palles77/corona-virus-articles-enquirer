Cats are a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) covered species with special housing requirements defined in the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC, 2011) . At the request of congress, a committee of experts formed by the National Research Council examined the use of random source dogs and cats and concluded that obtaining dogs and cats from Class B dealers is not necessary for NIH funded research (National Research Council, 2009) . While the number of cats used in biomedical research has declined, cats continue to contribute uniquely to biomedical science and are valuable research model for several disciplines, including aspects of neurology involved in locomotion and spinal trauma, retrovirus and zoonotic disease research, and for developing therapeutic strategies for inherited diseases.",

Examples of infections that have been studied in laboratory settings are listed in Table 13 .1. While SPF colonies are typically tested for presence of some viral diseases and toxoplasmosis, not all infections are excluded in laboratory SPF colonies.

FeLV has been studied to understand retroviral-induced immunodeficiency, particularly hematopoietic tumors such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma. After infection with FeLV, a fraction of cats become persistently viremic and virus is excreted, particularly through saliva and nasal secretions. Serological tests are based on detection of the major viral core protein of FeLV (p27 gag) in serum or plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) . Strengths of this model include substantial information on FeLV, pathogenesis of the disease, responses of the immune system, availability of FeLV strains of known virulence, and the ease of inducing infection and disease in cats (Hartmann, 2012; Willett and Hosie, 2013) . Immunodeficiency disease of cats caused by the lentivirus FIV is considered by many to be one of the most relevant naturally occurring models of human acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Hartmann, 2012; Magden et al., 2011; Elder et al., 2010) . The advantages of the feline disease model include the similarities with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the human lentivirus), similarities in pathogenesis and clinical signs, ease of experimental infection, and predictable disease progression. A weakness of the model relates to the limited variety of reagents available for identifying cells of the cat immune system. FIV has been molecularly cloned and resembles HIV in tissue and cell tropism but is antigenically distinct. Experimental transmission is achieved readily with infected blood or cultured cells. Cell-associated viremia occurs within 1-2 weeks and remains persistent, even after development of antibodies and T cell immunity. Characteristic changes in the immune system include lymphadenopathy, neutropenia, decreased lymphocyte proliferative response, and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections (Elder et al., 2010) . B-cell lymphomas and myeloproliferative disease are seen in some infected cats (Magden et al., 2011) . Interestingly, a commercially available vaccine provides reasonable protection against challenge with heterologous viral strains (Yamamoto et al., 2010) .",

Cats have been the preferred species for investigating SCI since the early part of the 20th century (Hultborn and Nielson, 2007) because, despite their small body size, the spinal cord of cats is similar in length (34 cm) and anatomy to the human spinal cord which is 40-45 cm (Perese and Fracasso, 1959) . In the SCI model, cats are taught to walk on a treadmill for a period of 3-4 weeks followed by surgery to implant electrodes in the brain and muscles of the rear legs and to create a lesion in the spinal cord, generally at the last thoracic segment (T13) (Rossignol et al., 2002) . After a period of recovery, cats are able to regain a normal locomotor pattern using a combination of training, electrical stimulation, and pharmacologic agents which demonstrates that the spinal cord has intrinsic circuitry that generates locomotion (Martinez and Rossignol, 2013) . Cats were favored for this research because their size allowed electrophysiological studies to be conducted with ease. The research focus during the last few decades has shifted to transplantation of embryonic stem cells, evaluation of the neurotransmitters and the molecular genetics of the circuitry controlling locomotion in the spinal cord (Hultborn and Nielson, 2007) For these types of studies, mice and rats are more commonly used. However, preclinical translational work for SCI will likely continue to be conducted in large animals, including cats (Kwon et al., 2010) . A recent study in cats demonstrated successful grafting of peripheral nerves onto the spinal cord (Hanna et al., 2011) which offers a promising potential therapy for patients with SCI.",

The cat was selected for genetic sequencing by the National Human Genome Research Institute due to the substantial number of naturally occurring inherited diseases that are homologous to human disease (Pontius et al., 2007; Mullikin et al., 2010) . Table 13 .2 lists some of the genetic disorders of cats which share similar clinical and pathologic characteristics to those of its human counterpart. Cat colonies with homologous diseases make excellent models for the evaluation of human directed preclinical gene therapy trials because of their large size (compared to rodents), outbred genetic diversity, and longevity, which allows for long-term evaluation of the stability of the treatment. Cats have been used extensively to study the central nervous system and the brain of the cat is well characterized and has similar anatomy to the human brain, making cats a good model for gene therapy trials for neurological disorders such as lysosomal storage disease (Blagbrough and Zara, 2009; Vite et al., 2005) .",

The addition of randomsource cats into facilities with stable research colonies of cats introduces unacceptable risks because, even after long periods of quarantine, inapparent or latent diseases such as feline immunodeficiency disease and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) may be transmitted to healthy cats. Random-source cats continue to be valuable for training veterinary students and for the establishment of genetic models of human diseases that have been identified in a pet population. In the latter case, a prolonged (8-to 12-week) isolation and observation period is needed to identify diseases, eliminate parasites and vaccinate in order to minimize pathogen transmission. When feasible, assisted reproductive techniques such as artificial insemination can be used to establish genetically valuable colonies.

Domestic cats develop highly structured interactive social groups, and most cats do not thrive in isolation. Therefore, individual housing should be avoided unless particular experimental objectives dictate the use of single-cage housing or if caging is needed for short periods of time to permit collection of specimens, administer material individually, or accomplish treatments and/or observations. Cats that are vicious or aggressive towards other cats should also be singly housed. If caged, cats should be allowed out of their cages daily to exercise, unless activity is contraindicated due to medical concerns. Cats should be housed in compatible pairs or, preferably, in small groups of the same sex. Females in heat should not be placed in the same primary enclosure as toms (inact males), unless for breeding purposes (AWA, 2008) . Breeding colonies are typically organized in harem groupings; this may consist of approximately four to six queens per tom. Twenty to twenty-five animals is typically the maximal number of cats successfully housed in a single breeding room, as long as enough floor, perch, feeding, and litter space is provided (Rochlitz, 2000) (Fig. 13 .1). Housing compatible pregnant queens together before they deliver may lead to shared nursing and neonatal care. After delivery, pairing becomes more problematic. Queens nursing litters and kittens that are under 4 months of age should not be housed with other adult FIGURE 13.1 Social housing for cats using a room as a primary enclosure.",

Larger runs are best for breeding groups of toms and queens, postweaning family groups, and single-sex adult groups. Galvanized wire panels with 1-inch mesh fence wire and a top panel are inexpensive, durable materials for run construction. Primary enclosures must be free of sharp edges, protrusions, or open spaces that would cause injury to its feline occupants.

Room illumination must be controlled to provide duration, intensity, and spectrum of light that is optimal for specific needs of an experiment. In general, daylight-spectrum fluorescent tubes and daylight-dark cycles of 12:12 or 14:10 h are useful and are required for successful breeding.

Traffic patterns should start with rooms housing pathogen-free and healthy animals, then quarantine animals whose health status has not been verified, and finally diseased animals in isolation (Hurley, 2005; Mostl et al., 2013) . Animals in isolation rooms should ideally also be subdivided based on whether they have respiratory, dermatologic, or gastrointestinal disease (Hurley, 2005) . Cats that have had exposure to infectious diseses (i.e., non-SPF cats) should ideally remain in quarantine for at least 6 weeks, which is the time it takes cats to seroconvert against FIV or become antigen-positive to FeLV (Mostl et al., 2013) . Cats from SPF sources should ideally be quarantined for at least a week after receipt to monitor for signs of shipment-related diseases, and serologic evaluation is recommended prior to mixing cats from different sources (Mostl et al., 2013) . The youngest and most immunocompromised animals should be handled before older animals that could transmit disease. In addition, queens with litters should be housed separately and handled prior to handling the rest of the colony to prevent disease spread from adults to kittens that are not yet immunocompetent (Mostl et al., 2013) . Finally, the entry order of the rooms depends on the research being conducted at the animal facility, e.g., animal rooms housing infectious disease studies need to be entered after rooms housing cats used in non-infectious research. If rooms must be entered out of order, it is imperative that proper barrier protocol is followed, such as showering between rooms or changing scrubs/shoes.",

Cats are hunters, and typically eat up to 20 small prey in a day (Ellis, 2009) ; providing toys and play that appeal to a cat's predatory instincts is beneficial to its well-being. Examples of these include hiding food kibble or treats for them to 'hunt' and find, using feathered toys they can catch and 'capture', and soft toys that can be bitten and moved around like prey. Items should also be provided for scent marking (Fig. 13.3) . Whatever play items are provided, they should be easily sanitizable or disposable in the event they become soiled. Interspecies enrichment takes place with cats that are housed in groups. Cats that are group housed should be provided multiple environmental enrichment items so dominant cats do not manipulate all available resources. Hiding areas should also be provided for more timid cats to rest comfortably and avoid stressful encounters with dominant run-mates. Cats that are singly housed should be given extra attention by care staff to ensure socialization. The most effective environmental enrichment is a staff that enjoys interacting with cats and is willing to spend adequate time to ensure their socialization; this can include daily gentle interactions to playing with laser pointers and 'wand'-type toys. Rest boards are required for comfort and contentment of cats because cats instinctively feel more secure when they can perch at a high point. These also provide an opportunity for lactating females to have rest periods away from their young. Boards should be constructed of dense plastic and anchored in such a way that crevices that accumulate hair and debris are avoided. Primahedrons can be attached to the ceiling to provide cats with the opportunity to climb and perch (Fig. 13.4 ).",

With proper health maintenance, nutrition, and control of light cycles, adolescent queens begin to cycle after attaining a body weight of 2 kg or more.

In the Northern Hemisphere, the season begins in January or February after the winter solstice, as the days get longer, and lasts until fall.

In an environmentally controlled laboratory setting, 10 or more hours of light in a 24-h period is required for reproductive cycling (Shille and Sojka, 1995) . Maintaining a 14-h light photoperiod and the use of natural daylight spectrum fluorescent bulbs ensures the maximum fertility period and estrous cycling (H. J. Baker, unpublished observations, 1999). Estrous cycling typically occurs within 7-10 weeks of instituting such a light cycle (Dawson, 1941; Scott and Lloyd-Jacob, 1959) ; however, this period can be shortened if preceded by a nonstimulatory light cycle of 8 or fewer hours of light (Hurni, 1981) , or if a tomcat or queen in estrus is introduced at the time of increasing the duration of light (Michel, 1993) .",

Queens can bear 50-150 kittens in a breeding life of approximately 10 years if allowed to mate naturally. Like tomcats, queens are polygamous and rarely form long-term bonds with a mate, although they often display preferences for particular mates. If allowed, a female may accept a number of males, and therefore litters may have multiple sires. Adolescent queens (queens less than 1 year of age) and queens greater than 8 years of age tend to cycle irregularly and to have smaller litters, more abortions, more stillbirths, and more kittens with birth defects. Following a normal lactation and weaning, queens return to estrus in 2-8 weeks (average 4 weeks) (Feldman and Nelson, 1996) . Many queens, however, return to fertile cycling while nursing their kittens (L\u00f6fstedt, 1982) . Although it is possible for a female to be continuously pregnant, nursing, or both, this high intensity of breeding is not recommended, because queens need a period of rest to regain body condition before the next period of pregnancy and lactation. Providing a period of short days (8 h of light or less) for 4-6 weeks each year ensures anestrus, and reproductive rest and may ultimately enhance reproductive performance.",

Accurate breeding records are essential to evaluate breeding performance. The following information should be recorded for each queen: parents, birth date, date estrus is observed, breeding dates, identification of breeding tom, results of ultrasound examination (if performed), dates of delivery of each litter, litter size, numbers of male and female kittens, live births, number and cause of stillbirths or neonatal mortality (if known), number of kittens weaned, and date of recurrence of estrus. Periodic review of these records will reveal infertility problems, fecundity, lactation problems, and abnormal viability of kittens in utero and postnatally. Queens or toms with a history of recurring poor production should be eliminated from a breeding colony. Breeding records should indicate clearly whether inbreeding is likely to be the cause of reproductive failure, and outbreeding to unrelated cats from minimal-disease stock may solve this problem.",

While such high dietary protein intake is not required, the diet of free-ranging cats contains containing approximately 52% crude protein (Plantinga et al., 2011) . Cats also have dietary requirements for specific nutrients such as taurine, arginine, arachidonic acid, vitamins A, D, and many B vitamins (such as thiamine and niacin), which in the wild were present in the tissues of their prey (Zoran and Buffington, 2011) . The digestive tract of cats has also evolved to accommodate consumption of highly digestible prey. Compared to dogs whose intestinal track is approximately six-times longer than their body length, the intestinal track of cats is only 4.2-times as long (NRC, 2006) , which results in food moving through the digestive tract at a faster rate. As a result of their unique physiology and dietary requirements, cats fed improperly formulated or processed diets experience adverse effects that can lead to long-term morbidity or mortality. Unfortunately, the laboratory animal community contains several examples of cats developing significant illness due to improperly formulated or processed diets. In one colony of SPF cats, 190 out of 540 at risk cats fed a gamma-irradiated (dose 36.3-47.3 KGy) commercial diet developed progressive hind-limb ataxia and proprioceptive defects diagnosed at necropsy as leukoencephalomyelopathy due to vitamin A deficiency (Cassidy et al., 2007) . The level of gamma irradiation used to treat the diet was subsequently found to reduce the vitamin A content of the diet to 31% of the untreated value (Caulfield et al., 2008) In another colony, cats fed a purified diet deficient in taurine developed retinal degeneration within three months (Hayes and Carey, 1975) and diets marginally deficient in taurine produced dilated cardiomyopathy only after the diet was consumed for more than three years (Pion et al., 1987) .",

AAFCO protocol feeding trials assess the digestibility, bioavailability, and palatability of a diet, making them the best test of a product's performance. The ideal cat food is highly palatable and formulated to provide optimum levels of readily bioavailable nutrients that are balanced to the caloric content of the diet, ensuring appropriate provision of all essential nutrients when caloric requirements are met. Commercial cat foods might provide a source of contamination for SPF colonies. In recent years, several commercial cat foods have been recalled due to Salmonella contamination (FDA, 2014) .

Laboratoryhoused cats are often provided continuous access to dry food which can be left out overnight without spoiling. Continuous access to food allows cats to mimic the feeding pattern of free-ranging cats that consume multiple small meals over the course of 24 h (MacDonald et al., 1984; Ellis, 2009 ), but can lead to excess weight and obesity if body weight and condition are not closely monitored and assessed.

The estimated energy need of adult lean cats at maintenance is 100 kcal/(kg body weight) 0.67 per day (NRC, 2006) , which can be used as an initial estimate for the amount of food that should be offered daily. An individual cat's energy requirements for maintenance of optimal weight and body condition can vary widely, exceeding more than 50% under or over the estimated amount and is best determined by weighing all colony cats monthly and assessing their body (Laflamme, 1997) and muscle condition (Michel et al., 2011) by palpation using established scoring criteria. Properly fed adult cats should be well muscled and the ribs should be readily palpable beneath a slight layer of fat. Viewing the cat from the side, the waist should be moderately tucked up behind the last rib, and the inguinal fat pad should be minimal (Laflamme, 1997) . Assessing muscle condition is important because cats tend to catabolize lean body tissue under conditions of acute stress either due to environmental factors or disease, and loss of muscle tissue may not be readily appreciated with traditional body condition scores that focus on body silhouette and fat stores (Baldwin et al., 2010; Michel et al., 2011) .",

Obesity is the most common nutritional disease in pet cats in the Western hemisphere (Laflamme, 2012) , and is common in laboratory-raised cats, particularly those on long-term studies. Obesity leads to increased health risks including the development of diabetes mellitus, hepatic lipidosis, and urinary tract diseases (Laflamme, 2012) . White adipose tissue is now recognized to be an important endocrine organ that secretes a variety of substances that are active in energy metabolism and appetite control such as steroid hormones, growth factors and various cytokines such as leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and visfatin, which are collectively known as adipokines (Zoran, 2010) . Leptin is several-fold higher in obese cats compared to lean cats without leading to the appropriate physiological response of appetite suppression (Hoenig, 2012) . Obesity in cats also leads to upregulation of mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b3 in adiposites ( Van de Velde et al., 2013) . While an initial, small study in cats did not demonstrate an adverse impact of obesity on white blood cell counts or lymphocyte function (Jaso-Friedmann et al., 2008) the potential impacts of inflammation during obesity on the immune system continue to be investigated. Obesity in cats is more easily prevented than treated. Cats becoming overconditioned with ad libitum access to food should be fed a fixed amount of food twice daily. This can be problematic in colonies maintained in grouphoused situations over long periods of time, and may require specialized exercise or feeding plans.",

After parturition, energy requirements continue to rise to three-to four-times those of maintenance, as queens nurse their kittens (Lawler and Bebiak, 1986) . Peak lactation occurs at 2-3 weeks postpartum. Maintaining adequate nutrition during this time is extremely important to ensure production of sufficient quantities of milk, particularly in queens with large litters. After weaning, milk production and mammary congestion can be decreased by fasting queens for 24 h before returning to maintenance feeding.

Selection for disease resistance and docile temperaments should be considered. For example, queens repeatedly producing kittens with congenital abnormalities, or dams that are not able to successfully raise the majority of their kittens to weaning should be removed from breeding stock. Small colonies will rapidly lose genetic heterozygosity, and formerly recessive traits may become more commonly expressed. It may be necessary to include periodic expansion from other colonies with similar disease background to avoid inbreeding depression. This is problematic in colonies maintained to preserve a genetic disorder.",

Cats used in vaccine studies will also not typically be routinely vaccinated with commercial vaccines, as these may interfere with candidate vaccine study outcomes. Cats maintained for preservation of genetic traits may undergo preventative health maintenance more akin to cats kept as pets. Scherk et al.

The health status of the individual cat will also affect immune response to immunization as immunocompromised animals will likely not mount an appropriately robust response to afford protection (Day, 2006; Scherk et al., 2013) . The closed/open status of a colony, animal density, research use of animals, and potential exposure (either through fomites carried into the facility or geographical presence of pathogens) should be considered when develoing immunization protocols (Scherk et al., 2013) . The type of vaccine administered can vary depending on the reproductive status of the individual animal. Vaccinating pregnant queens is generally not recommended due to the possibility of infecting the fetus during pregnancy or lactation. For example, administering a modified-live feline panleukopenia virus vaccine to a pregnant queen could cause cerebellar hypoplasia in her kittens; in cases like these, inactivated vaccines should be used instead (Scherk et al., 2013) .",

While there is no specific number of animals that constitute overcrowding, it is recommended that groups be kept as small and stable as possible. For example, to reduce risk of coronavirus spread, keeping animals in groups of up to three cats can reduce risk of spread, while groups consisting of more than six animals were found to consistently have coronavirus infections (Pedersen, 2009; Addie et al., 2009) . Kittens should remain only with their queens and littermates until weaning (Mostl et al., 2013) . Other stressors that should be avoided include irregular feeding and husbandry schedules, unpredictable daily manipulations, and infrequent or indifferent human contacts (Carlstead et al., 1993; Mostl et al., 2013; Hurley, 2005; Overall et al., 2004) .",

Transmission is usually indirect through the fecal-oral route. Clinical signs include diarrhea, lymphopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, cerebellar hypoplasia in kittens, and abortion. While both adults and young are affected, kittens are the most vulnerable population and suffer mortality rates as high as 90% (Truyen et al., 2009) . Treatment is largely supportive. This nonenveloped virus is very resistant to environmental conditions and many disinfectants, is highly contagious, and rapidly accumulates in the environment due to high shedding of virions from affected animals. Passive immunity from maternally acquired antibodies tends to last 6-8 weeks before levels of antibody begin to decline. At this point, an immunity gap can take place, where levels of antibody are too low to protect the kitten but high enough to interfere with vaccination (Truyen et al., 2009) . Therefore, it is recommended that kittens at risk of exposure receive vaccines for panleukopenia as early as 6 weeks of age, repeated every 3-4 weeks until 16-20 weeks of age. Revaccination should occur 1 year later, and then every 3 years (Scherk et al., 2013) .",

The effusive form may be subclinical for weeks, with affected young animals appearing unthrifty, before clinical disease is manifested (Pedersen, 2009) . The onset of the effusive form includes fever, anorexia, malaise, and weight loss. Painless abdominal distention due to ascites is the most common clinical sign observed in affected animals; the effusion tends to be yellow-tinged and mucinous and amounts can reach up to a liter in severe cases. Other clinical signs include dyspnea from pleural involvement or thoracic effusion, ocular and neurologic signs, scrotal edema in intact males, and synovitis due to immunecomplex formation and deposition (Pedersen, 2009 ). The 'dry' form of FIP is less common and is characterized by granulomatous lesions in various organs as well as central nervous system involvement and ocular disease. Granulomatous lesions are commonly found in the kidneys, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver, and tend to be painful on palpation; smaller granulomas can also be found in the lungs (Pedersen, 2009) .",

Infested kittens may develop diarrhea as early as 2-3 weeks of age. Hookworms cause blood loss and anemia. Female worms produce eggs that pass in the feces and may persist in the soil for years. Control is readily achieved through proper sanitation and routine deworming of kittens. Pyrantel pamoate (8-10 mg/kg PO q3 weeks \u00d7 3 treatments) is highly effective against both roundworms and hookworms and is cost-effective and easy to administer.

Although no potential human health risk should be underestimated, in fact there are only a few of these infections that should be of any concern for a minimal-disease, closed cat colony. Infections of primary concern include cat scratch disease, dermatophytosis, and toxoplasmosis. 'Cat Scratch Disease' is caused by infection by Bartonella henselae that may be carried inapparently by cats and are transmitted to humans by bite or scratch wounds or fleas. Personell handling cats should be aware of the potential for this infection and should thoroughly wash bite or scratch wounds and seek medical attention, particularly for a wound that does not respond to the usual treatment (Guptill, 2010) . Dermatophytosis usually results from Microsporum canis and can be diagnosed by culture of the organism. It can be a difficult disease to treat in large groups of cats, and if treatment is attempted, the risk of human exposure must be considered (DeBoer and Moriello and DeBoer, 1995; Bond, 2010) . Toxoplasmosis is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that can be transmitted to cats and humans by ingestion of infected feces/soil or undercooked meat. Diagnosis is difficult, but the simple expedient of changing litter daily, using gloves when handling litter and litter pans, and washing hands will eliminate risk (Gerhold and Jessup, 2013) . Rabies vaccination of cats should be considered because of legal obligations and interstate shipping regulations; otherwise, while contact with feral or 'barn cats' poses a potential risk, there is little or no risk to cats maintained in a closed colony derived from disease-free stock (Gerhold and Jessup, 2013) .",
