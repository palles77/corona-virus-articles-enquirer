In our previous study, sequencing of the NA gene was not successful for the first throat swab specimens from patients 8 and 10 because of low viral load (3). However, in this study, the 292K mutant was found in sputum specimens from these 2 patients on days 7 or 15, respectively, after initiation of antiviral treatment. This finding suggested that influenza A(H7N9) virus mutated under the pressure of antiviral treatment, which led to failure of the virus to clear the lower respiratory tracts. These 2 patients, who were infected with the drug-resistant mutant virus, recovered from their diseases, which suggested that host immune response might play a major role in controlling the mutant virus.",
