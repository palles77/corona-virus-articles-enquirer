Recombinant protein-based vaccines are usually formulated with aluminum (alum)-based adjuvants to ensure an adequate immune response. However, use of alum triggers a Th2-biased immune induction, and hence is not optimal. Although the adjuvanticity of RNA has been reported, a systematic and overall investigation on its efficacy is lacking. We found that single strand RNA (termed RNA adjuvant) derived from cricket paralysis virus intergenic region internal ribosome entry site induced the expression of various adjuvant-function-related genes, such as type 1 and 2 interferon (IFN) and toll-like receptor (TLR), T cell activation, and leukocyte chemotaxis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells; furthermore, its innate and IFN transcriptome profile patterns were similar to those of a live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine. This suggests that protein-based vaccines formulated using RNA adjuvant function as liveattenuated vaccines. Application of the RNA adjuvant in mouse enhanced the efficacy of Middle East respiratory syndrome spike protein, a protein-subunit vaccine and human papillomavirus L1 protein, a virus-like particle vaccine, by activating innate immune response through TLR7 and enhancing pAPC chemotaxis, leading to a balanced Th1/Th2 responses. Moreover, the combination of alum and the RNA adjuvant synergistically induced humoral and cellular immune responses and endowed long-term immunity. Therefore, RNA adjuvants have broad applicability and can be used with all conventional vaccines to improve vaccine efficacy qualitatively and quantitively.",

            "text": "Aluminum hydroxide (alum) is widely used as an adjuvant in several human vaccines [7] . It has been reported that alum injection leads to the rapid accumulation of neutrophils and other cells forming lumps composed of neutrophil extracellular traps. This further induces lysosome-mediated lysis to distort the plasma membrane of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and/or rapidly induces the synthesis cytokines/chemokines, finally activating the NALP3 inflammasome and triggering the secretion of IL-1b. This process might contribute to the adjuvant effect of alum. However, further confirmation is required [8] . In addition, alum induces a profound T helper 2 (Th2) response along with antibody production. However, alum cannot induce Th1 responses and sometimes stimulates autoimmunity by upregulating IgE presentation [9] . Since classical adjuvants solely induce Th2 responses, new adjuvants capable of promoting Th1 responses are required to increase the cell-mediated response [8] . Non-classical adjuvants, such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, can stimulate the production of type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines [10] . Type I IFN facilitates antigen presentation to major histocompatibility complex class I/II, leading to an enhanced cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response, as well as a CD4+ T cell response [11] .",

In addition, RNase-resistant poly I:C stabilized with poly-L-lysine (poly ICLC) was shown to have strong adjuvanticity by microbial mimicking for inducing innate immune responses in humans through TLR3 and MDA5 [14] . Despite the strong adjuvanticity of poly I:C, there are concerns about its induction of adverse and excessive immune responses, such as autoimmune diseases and difficulty in standardization for mass production [15] . In previous studies, poly I:C-induced massive type I IFNs were shown to be critical for the pathogenesis of lupus [16] . Moreover, repeated administration of poly I:C derivate, poly ICLC, and carboxymethylcellulose, showed severe pathogenicity and resulted in the development of tuberculosis in mice [17] .",

Recently, ssRNA formulated with carriers showed immune-enhancement effects through TLR and retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-like helicase signaling pathways [21, 22] .

In this study, we investigated the adjuvant effects of ssRNAs (RNA adjuvant) derived from the Cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) intergenic region (IGR) IRES [23] . We formulated the RNA adjuvant with protein-subunit vaccine for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-coronavirus (CoV) and virus-like particle vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV) and showed that the RNA adjuvant induced a balanced Th1/Th2 response and innate immunity. Moreover, as expected, the RNA adjuvant worked through TLR7 and recruited APCs to increase antigen uptake into the injected site and their retention in the draining lymph node (dLN). Furthermore, we showed that the RNA adjuvant enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses by promoting antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and the Th1 response and ultimately endowing long-term immunity. The results demonstrated that an RNA adjuvant could be developed as a general, safe, and effective adjuvant applicable to protein-based vaccine types.",

Mice were deeply anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of zoletil (30 mg/kg) and rompun (10 mg/kg). During imaging, mouse body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C with a homeothermic controller (Physio-Suite; RightTemp; Kent Scientific). A mixture of Alexa Fluor 647 (A20006, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and either RNA adjuvant or PBS was subcutaneously injected into the mouse ear skin using a 31G microinjector (1700 series syringe, Hamilton). To label vasculatures, an anti-CD31 antibody (553369, BD Biosciences) conjugated with Alexa Flour 555 (A20009, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was injected intravascularly 1 h before imaging. Using the distinctive vasculature and the fluorescence signal of Alexa Fluor 647 as a landmark for the repetitive imaging of the injected site, the recruitment of CX3CR1-GFP + dendritic cells (irregular outlines) and monocytes (round outlines) was imaged in vivo at 20 min and 24 h after the injection. The recruitment of dendritic cells and monocytes was quantified by calculating the area occupied by CX3CR1-GFP + cells using ImageJ plugins (NIH).",

As expected, IgG1 levels of in the KO mice were lower than those of WT mice at 2-weeks after first immunization (Fig. 7A) . However, IgG1 was increased, while IgG2c was not, in KO mice at 2-weeks after second immunization (Fig. 7A) , suggesting that the RNA adjuvant might have partially overcome the loss of TLR7 for Th2 induction but not Th1 via boosting. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with the RNA adjuvant or a positive control (R848 as TLR7/8 agonist and poly I:C) showed the induction of Myd88, RIG-I, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5, phosphorylated interferon regulatory factor 3, and TANK-binding kinase 1/NF-jB activating kinase, which are the downstream molecules of TLR7 and RIG-Ilike receptor pathways [30] (Supplementary Fig. 4) , suggesting that, while Th1 activation by RNA adjuvant may be critically dependent on the TLR7 pathway, Th2 activation by RNA adjuvant may be induced by multiple mechanisms that bypass the TLR7 signaling pathway, such as the pathway involving RIG-Ilike receptor, which is one of other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).",

The RNA adjuvant induced the expression of genes related to the innate immune response (IFN and TLR-Myd88), T cell activation, and leukocyte chemotaxis similar to poly(I:C) in hPBMCs; however, the induction levels were lower than those by poly(I:C), and most genes returned to normal levels within 24 h (Fig. 1 ). This transient induction of genes by the RNA adjuvant may be evidence of vaccine safety. Similarly, a previous report demonstrated the rapid disappearance of the RNA platform within 24 h after injection [23] . We did not observe any adverse effects, such as autoimmune symptoms, changes in liver function, or organ damage, in the RNA adjuvant-immunized mice, even at a higher dose (200 mg/-mouse) (data not shown). Although poly(I:C) can be a superior adjuvant, safety concerns, such as an excessive immune response, represents a significant drawback [15] . However, our RNA adjuvant appeared to overcome this safety issue without decreasing the immune-stimulation effect.",

In particular, IL-6, which is highly expressed in CD4+ T cells, is partially responsible for Th2 cytokine production in Th1-differentiated cells via protein kinase C theta and NF-jB signaling pathways [32] . Additionally, IL-15 stimulates T and natural killer cell immunity and promotes the generation of long-lived memory T cells [33] . Furthermore, STAT1 functions as a central regulator of innate and adaptive immunity, and STAT3 is essential for DC, Tfh cell, and memory CD8+ T cell development [34, 35] . Given that the RNA adjuvant activated the Th1 response and induced long-term immunity (Figs. 4-6) , induction of these genes might have played an important role in this immune response. Fig. 6 .

These data indicated that this RNA adjuvant might be efficacious for inducing a broad immune response mediated through TLR7 signaling and T cell activation. However, the PRR for the RNA adjuvant cannot be confined to TLR7 alone, as the RNA adjuvant could induce RIG-I-like receptor pathwayrelated molecules similar to R848 and poly I:C ( Supplementary  Fig. 4 ). This indicated that the RNA adjuvant is recognized by RIG-I-like receptor in addition to TLR7 to activate an immune response. These data are accordance with a previous study, which showed that RNA based adjuvants triggered TLR-and RIG-I-like helicase-dependent effect [22] . Therefore, the boosting with RNA adjuvant may partially induce an IgG1 (Th2) response in Tlr7-KO mice through the RIG-I-like pathway. However, we do not know why this pathway cannot induce IgG2c (Th1). Further studies are required to understand the detailed underlying mechanism.",

Our data suggest that T cell activation of G5 may also show a synergistic increase, however, more data are needed to confirm this (Fig. 4D) . Additionally, given the strong immune-stimulating effect of the RNA adjuvant, it was unsurprising that the RNA adjuvant-HPV group was able to maintain HPV-specific NAb levels and the Th1 response, even at 27weeks after first immunization (Fig. 6) . These results indicated that the RNA adjuvant triggered long-term immunity, including humoral and cellular immune responses. This is an important fea- Fig. 7 . The RNA adjuvant induces a Th1 response through TLR7 and CD4+/CD8+ T cells.

The RNA adjuvant-containing target gene HPV-L1 also showed an immune-stimulating effect. Therefore, although we previously showed that an RNA platform could express a coding gene [23] , RNA adjuvant including target gene is not critical to ensure adjuvanticity. However, should this RNA platform be used as an RNA vaccine, it needs to encode target genes. Further, improvements in the delivery strategy to increase the expression efficiency in the inoculated animal muscle are warranted. Interestingly, we compared the adjuvanticity of CrPV-IGR IRES-derived RNA with those of other RNA virus-derived adjuvants, including coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) IRESsderived RNAs. CrPV and CVB3 IRES-derived RNAs showed higher adjuvant effects compared to that of the EMCV IRES-derived RNA (data not shown). Studies are underway on the effect of the viral IRES type on the immune effect.",

Moreover, it can potentially overcome challenges associated with protein-subunit vaccines, such as weak T cell activation. The associated immune responses consequently promote high NAb levels and balanced Th1 and Th2 responses, resulting in long-term immunity. Therefore, since the RNA adjuvant exhibited immune-enhancing capacity, it might be valuable not only as a first-line vaccine in an epidemic emergency but also to improve protein-based vaccine efficacy.",
