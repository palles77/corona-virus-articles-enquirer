Establishing a rapid etiological diagnosis of community-acquired acute respiratory illness (CARTI) may improve treatment decisions and patient outcomes. Selection of the most appropriate testing method and of the pathogens to be investigated remains a challenge [1] . A combination of several microbiological methods is often required: bacterial or viral culture, bacterial or viral antigen detection, nucleic acid amplification techniques and serology. The investigation of all potential causal agents rapidly becomes too time-consuming and costly. Choices as to the diagnostic methods to be used must therefore be made, and these choices are often driven by clinical presentation [2] . However, in clinical practice, symptoms, such as fever and myalgia, and even lung imaging findings are frequently misleading. The H1N1pdm09 flu epidemic showed that hospitalised cases of influenza-like illness were frequently attributed to a wide range of respiratory viruses and bacteria [3] . The confusion of these infections with true influenza hampered preventive and treatment measures and resulted in the unnecessary occupation of hospital beds by patients that did not actually require hospitalisation.",

The incidence of influenza virus infections peaked during weeks 8 to 11. HCoV OC43, HMPV and RSV and Mycoplasma infections were more evenly distributed over the winter months (Fig. 1) .

In total, 255 of the 279 (91.4%) samples were studied by both indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and multiplex PCR. We excluded 24 samples from the comparative study because less than 20 epithelial cells were observed in IFA and/or because they contained PCR inhibitors. IFA detected a respiratory virus in 27 of 255 (11%) specimens: 15 INF A, seven HMPV and five RSV. No double infections were picked up with this technique. IFA detected some of the INF A (15/51, 29%), HMPV (7/15, 47%) and RSV (5/12, 42%) infections identified by multiplex PCR but did not detect all the AdV infections. All positive results obtained by IFA were confirmed by multiplex real-time PCR (Fig. 2) .",

            "text": "It was widely thought that severe CARTI in infants is caused by a relatively limited number of viral pathogens, including predominantly paramyxovirus. This led to a diagnostic strategy based on immunofluorescence assays exploring a dozen viruses, together with single immunochromatography assays for RSV infections [6] . Viruses highly prevalent in infancy, such as HMPV and RSV, are also detected in adults, together with a diverse range of other bacterial and viral pathogens. Given this broad spectrum of etiologies for CARTI in adults, the routine use of a broad panel of single time-consuming techniques is far from ideal. The introduction of multiplex PCR has revolutionized the management of CARTI in adults. In a continuous series of 279 patients hospitalised for CARTI, the putative causal agent was identified in 171 cases (61%): 195 viruses and 21 bacteria were identified in 130 single infections and 41 co-infections. The clinical significance of these results is unclear. Some of the infections detected may be bona fide infections directly responsible for the symptoms observed. Others may be viral infections unassociated with the symptoms, detected fortuitously in the patients carrying them. The H1N1pdm09 flu epidemic illustrates the paradigm shift resulting from the introduction of multiplex PCR. A large number of patients were hospitalised for a severe flu-like syndrome and were tested by multiple PCRs or multiplex PCR; many of these patients were found to be infected with pathogens unsuspected in this clinical context [3] . These findings suggest that the roles and distributions of the different viruses in CARTI should be reconsidered. For instance, rhinovirus infections are very common throughout the year in temperate areas. A given individual may suffer several episodes of rhinovirus infection due to the large number of genotypes and the lack of cross-protection. However, there are several lines of evidence suggesting that rhinoviruses play a significant role in CARTI in adults: asymptomatic rhinovirus carriage is seldom encountered in this population (0.1 to 2%) [7] and these viruses have been shown to have a significant pathogenic impact in vivo during experimental infections in adults [8, 9] . Rhinoviruses are also thought to interfere with other potential viral respiratory pathogens, preventing co-infection [10, 11] . Consistent with these findings, rhinovirus and influenza virus were the most prevalent pathogens in our study, and they appeared to be mutually exclusive. In the 2009-2010 H1N1pdm09 epidemic, large numbers of patients were hospitalised for severe CARTI and subjected to drastic prevention measures to prevent the spread of the epidemic flu virus, but were eventually found to be infected with rhinovirus [3] . Testing for rhinovirus has thus become paramount in the evaluation of respiratory tract infections. The position of HBoV remains much less clear. These viruses are highly prevalent, with almost 100% of the population having antibodies directed against them by the age of six years. The incidence of HBoV-associated CARTI is low in adults, at 1 to 5% [12] . In our study, HBoV were found in 16% of samples. They were associated with another bacterial or viral pathogen in 21 cases, accounting for 52% of all co-infections, and three of the four triple infections observed involved HBoV. These observations argue against HBoV playing a key role in CARTI. However, conflicting observations have been made in infants, in whom HBoV are more strongly associated with lower respiratory tract infection [13] , the severity of the disease being correlated with viral load [14] . The inclusion or removal of HBoV probes from multiplex PCR assays has been much debated. For instance, the most recent format of the Film array TM Respiratory panel (BioFire Diagnostics Inc, United States) does not contain HBoV probes whereas previous versions did. HCoV are recognized to be responsible for some cases of selfresolving common cold syndrome. They have also been associated with severe pneumonia in immunocompromised patients Note that data are mirrored across the diagonal. [15] . They appear to vary considerably between years with seasonal sporadic outbreaks [16] . HCoV OC43 was the most frequent of these viruses, detected in 12 of 20 cases in our study. It was frequently found in mixed infections, co-infections with coronavirus accounting for 50% of our cases. Our assay investigated only four bacterial pathogens: B. pertussis, C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila. The culture of these pathogens requires specific growth media and is slow, fastidious and costly. In a clinical setting, it is not possible to perform such cultures routinely, and the choice of culture technique depends on the clinical presentation. The introduction of primers for these respiratory pathogens into multiplex PCR assays would therefore facilitate diagnosis. M. pneumoniae infection was diagnosed in 17 cases (8%), and was associated with other pathogens in seven of these cases. Serological tests were used to assess the significance of positive PCR results for Mycoplasma, because the long-term carriage of Mycoplasma has been observed [17] . In five patients, IgM antibodies directed against Mycoplasma were detected in the month following PCR. For the other patients, the absence of IgM, particularly during the period shortly after infection, would have hindered interpretation [18] . Blood samples for serological tests were generally collected at admission and the taking of a second sample was not systematic in our setting. We have since recommended a change in practice, with the taking of a second sample some time after admission in cases in which the interval between the onset of symptoms and hospital admission is less than two weeks.",

With molecular detection, 144 more samples (of 279 in total) than for conventional techniques were tested positive for at least one pathogen. These results are consistent with previous findings [20] . However, the clinical significance of these findings remains unclear, particularly as concerns the multiple infections. Commercial multiplex assays are not appropriate for all situations. For example, they are not suitable for the detection of emerging pathogens, for which an additional specific, sensitive test, such as monoplex PCR, is required. In the last 10 years, there have been several epidemics of acute respiratory tract infections due to emerging pathogens. These epidemics caused considerable logistic problems, because it was not possible to isolate patients (SRAS outbreak) or to apply specific therapeutic and preventive measures (H1N1pdm09 outbreak) in the absence of specific diagnosis. Highly automated laboratories making use of combinations of multiple assays are therefore required and must be capable of producing sensitive new tests to enable us to face the unknown.",
