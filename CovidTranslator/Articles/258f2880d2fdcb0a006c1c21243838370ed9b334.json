The plant belongs to mahogany family (Meliaceae) of flowering plants consisting of over 500 species and about 50 genera of trees and shrubs growing in the tropical and subtropical regions. (\"Meliaceae.\" Britannica Academic) C. serrata hard bark served as fuelwood and is used in construction, roofing, fencing and utensils (Ahmad et al., 2009) . For agricultural purposes, this tree was the best to be intercropped in a bean/banana intercrop (Ouma, 2009) . Additionally, this plant is used customary for the treatment of various diseases such as; diabetes mellitus (Jan et al., 2011; Hamayun, 2005; Yaseen et al., 2015; Awan et al., 2011; Rashid et al., 2015) , diarrhea (Jan et al., 2012) , fever (Khan et al., 2015) and skin infections (Awan et al., 2011) . Moreover, its crude extract contains several phytochemicals, mainly Phenolics and flavonoids, having diverse pharmacological properties ranging from cytotoxic to anti-glycating activities. The plant does possess potential to be explored further, as the number of pharmacological activities and results reported for this plant may not be normalized and validated enough to consider the plant for further mechanistic and molecular level studies.

These flavonoids were isolated and identified for the first time by Ahmad et al. (2016) The compounds were isolated from ethyl acetate fraction of the crude 80% methanolic leaves extract. The identified flavonoid glycosides were hyperoside (Quercetin-3-O-\u03b2galactoside), Quercitrin (quercetin-3-O-\u03b1-rhamnoside) and astragalin (Kaempferol-3-O-\u03b2-glucoside). Their structures are presented in Fig. 2 . These flavonoids exerted antioxidant and antiglycating activities. Among these isolated compounds, Quercetin-3-O-\u03b2-galactoside showed greater in vitro anti-oxidant activity as compared to Kaempferol-3-O-\u03b2glucoside, confirming the superiority of Quercetin glycosides over Kaempferol glycosides in terms of antioxidant potential. Besides, these compounds showed better antioxidant activity as a mixture than pure compounds suggesting synergistic effect of these flavonoids. Unlike antioxidant activity of flavonoids mixture, the mixture did not exhibit synergistic antiglycating effect. (Ahmad et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "6.1. Antimicrobial, antiviral and antifungal activity C. serrata was proven by several studies to have antibacterial activities. Ahmad et al., using agar well diffusion method, tested methanolic extract of C. serrata leaves and bark. The methanolic fraction of the bark extract exerted in-vitro antimicrobial action against the grampositive organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Bacillus subtilis, and the gram-negative organisms: Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp and Salmonella typhi. The bark extract showed significant inhibition of Citrobacter spp growth with an inhibition zone of 22.33 \u00b1 0.05 mm at the concentration (150 \u03bcg/ml). It is suggested that C. serrata antimicrobial activity is due to its high contents of phenols present in the bark (Ahmad et al., 2013) . Another study was conducted by Jan et al., evaluating the antibacterial effect of C. serrata crude extract at various concentrations (10, 20 and 30 mg/ml). Using agar well diffusion method, the crude extract of C. serrata showed an in-vitro inhibitory potential towards microbes; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. Zones of inhibition were measured for different concentrations of C. serrata crude extract. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of C. serrata ethanolic fraction was 3 mg/ml for P. aeruginosa and 6 mg/ml for E. coli, S. typhi, S. aureus and P. vulgaris. According to Jan et al., antimicrobial activity might contribute to the presence of tannins, steroids and volatile oils or the presence of phenolic compounds (Jan et al., 2012) . Bibi et al., reported C. serrata methanolic leaves extract invitro antimicrobial activity at 20 mg/ml against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas spp with a maximum zone of inhibition of 16 mm and a minimum of inhibition Escherichia coli growth. However, it showed moderate inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus and Kelbsiella pneumoniae (Bibi et al., 2018) . S. aureus, S. typhi, E. coli and S. flexneri are the chief infectious agents causing diarrhea in humans (Anne and Geboes, 2002) . The use of C. serrata and various herbal remedies for the treatment of diarrhea is reported in different communities, especially in Pakistan (Jan et al., 2012) . C. serrata showed potent antimicrobial activities against various strains of bacteria causing diarrhea. Such activity may support its community use as an anti-diarrheal agent. Additionally, C. serrata exhibited antiviral activity against of the lifethreatening virus (i.e. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Its crude tender leaf extracts exerted in vitro inhibition of SARS-CoV replication with EC 50 value of 30 \u03bcg/ml (Chen et al., 2008) . Although the activity the extract exhibited is considered significant, it is an old method used for establishing any antibacterial activity of plants and its extracts. More sophisticated and reliable methods i.e. dilution methods using spectrophotometer are available. The species studied in these reports are generally utilized by most of the authors, possibly due to its more sensitivity even at low doses of herbs or herbal extracts. Besides, the dose applied with claim to have significant result i.e. 3 and 6 mg/ml, is too high. To be considered as potent antibacterial, the extract and plant parts must possess activity at very low concentration and especially against emerging strains of bacteria where the world is endangered and posed with resistance phenomenon. The statistical tool used in the studies was improper. A proper ANOVA or t-test based data evaluation and analysis with P=0.05 should be reported to make the data reliable and significant. IC 50 was observed in none of the studies and there were no MIC or MEC value reported which is of prime importance for human clinical uses. The presence of phenolic compounds as well as tannins was mentioned as the source for antimicrobial property hence, further studies are ultimately needed to confirm the nature and structure of the specific phenolic compound or tannins with the mentioned property. More studies will confirm if the activity is imparted by phenolic, flavonoids or any other class of chemical entities. The compound may be explored for clinical trials so to produce drugs with unique properties in terms of treatment.",

A possibility exists that the plant phytochemicals may exhibit cytotoxic effects in various tissues with a lack of antimicrobial effect at given concentrations. Probably, their use may be limited to mutated or genetically modified microbial strains.

Using standard agar dilution method, Bibi et al., reported the invitro antifungal activity of C. serrata extract against Fusarium oxysporum. At 24 mg/ml, the chloroform fraction of C. serrata extract showed 34.91% inhibition of F. oxysporum growth whereas the methanolic fraction showed 23.38% inhibition (Bibi et al., 2018) . The methanolic fraction of C. serrata bark extract showed significant in-vitro antifungal activity against Candida albicans with a IC 50 value of 39.3 \u03bcg/ml, whereas the chloroform fraction of the leaves extract showed significant activity against Trichophyton rubrum with IC 50 value of 25.9 \u03bcg/ ml (Ahmad et al., 2013) . C. albicans is reported by Robert et al., to be attributed to diarrhea caused by certain antimicrobial medications (Robert et al., 2001) . Its anti-fungal activity against this strain of fungi may support the customary use of C. serrata for the treatment of diarrhea (Jan et al., 2012) . The supportive data from a particular group of people is not suffcient evidence to use these plants or extracts in any fungal infection. The antifungal study here seems to be a very preliminary data and for sure a gap for more research exists in terms of evaluating the effect of these extracts on resistant as well as commonly prevailed strains and to take this research till mechanistic level where the adverse effects may be reported too. The worriyng factor here is the dose as mentioned above, this may be potentially toxic at high concentration i.e. used for human treatmnets. Thus it is very critical to develop advanced models for antifungal potential including resistant strains, low doses, proper standards as well as statistical models for comparing the data. Overall, the antibacterial and antifungal studies reported exhibits a weak approach applied. A proper pharmacolgical model consisting of in vivo and cell culture studies are utmost needed in order to confirm the potential toxicity and therputic activity for the plant and its extract. The data presented may not be reproducible as it needs further in-depth research. The MIC values observed, dose applied, model for study used and contol applied in the study does not permit to claim the data for clinical uses. The authors suggest further exploration of these activities using in vivo models with low doses and toxicity reports which are reproducible and properly validated.",

The n-hexane fraction of the leaves extract exhibited similar activity against T. cruzi with IC 50 value of 2.24 \u03bcg/ml (Ahmad et al., 2013) . The activity against parasites is interesting and significant here. However, what is the value of such extract in real practice for these parasites? This needs to be explored further. Mostly, these results vary up to a great extent when the model for treatment is changed. The same dose concentration may be easily applied in clinical trials especially in patients with leishmanial diseases. However, the risk-to-benefit ratio for the extract in terms of side effects, adverse effects, dose and therapeutic outcome is more important to make the plant as a useful and respective species in the market. It is worthy to add here, that leishmanial disease is an important field and scope of research for a number of laboratories and researchers, where they are utilizing every possible resource to find a significant and potent agent to eradicate leishmanial diseases. Despite, much work is needed to properly apply the plant in current disease. The very basic hindrance of using plant parts i.e. extracts which are treated with toxic solvents such as n-hexane and chloroform may be conisdered seriously. Most of the times it is the solvent and its resdiues which may play a cytotoxic or antiparasitic role. This may be overruled first. Literature reports suggest the very low dose of chloroform sufficient enough for death. Hence, microbes or parasites may be killed at a compratively more low doses. Likewise, none of the study reported the phytochemical or its class in the same plant responsible for such activity. More probably it may be a synergistic effcet exerted by the leaves or bark extract of the plant responsible for such activity. None of the positive or especially negative control were observed in the study in order to assure the effect was due to extract potential rather then the solvent itself. In the very case, even if these factors are overuled, still the same study needs to be applie din proper pharmcological models of cell culture techniques and in vivo models. Toxicity profile for the extracts with minimum dose selection have a key importance to apply the model in clincial studies. To overcome this, further research is essential in terms of isolation of the active chemical entity, structure elucidation and clinical trials at the level of multicenter and mutlifaceted studies. The model used for the activity with proper standards (positive and negative), underlying mechanisms, effective and safe dose, cytochrome P-450 enzymes utilized during metabolism and more importantly the interactions with other drugs needs to be defined.",

It is suggested that AGEs are produced in case of intracellular hyperglycemia, which triggers intracellular auto-oxidation of glucose into various reactive products, which react with intracellular and extracellular proteins forming AGEs (Brownlee, 2001) . Diabetic patients can be protected from glycationderived free radicals damage using antioxidants. Compounds having combined antiglycation and antioxidant activity are reported to be more effective anti-diabetic agents. C. serrata bark extract (200 \u03bcL extract at different concentrations) showed highest in vitro activity against AGEs formation with an IC 50 value of 0.61 \u00b1 0.02 mg/ml. Similarly, the leaves extract showed significant in vitro antiglycation activity with an IC 50 value of 0.89 \u00b1 0.03 mg/ml. As C. serrata contains the highest contents of phenols and flavonoids in its bark and leaves, respectively, this plant's antiglycating activity may be attributed to the presence of such compounds (Ahmad et al., 2013) . Additionally, the ethyl acetate fraction of C. serrata leaves extract showed significant in vitro antiglycating activity with IC 50 value of 0.62 \u00b1 0.02 mg/ml. The extract was prepared by dissolving 1 mg in 3 ml as stock solutions and further three dilutions were prepared in a concentration of 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 from stock solution (Ahmad et al., 2016) . Having antioxidant and antiglycating activity, C. serrata could be a useful for preventing diabetic complications in diabetic patients. As mentioned above, several ethnobotanical studies reported the cultural use of C. serrata in Pakistan for the treatment and management of diabetes (Yaseen et al., 2015; Hamayun, 2005; Jan et al., 2011; Awan et al., 2011) .

Besides, expanded studies in the shape of clinical trials are intensively needed to treat effectively the very emerging and prevalent disease of AGEs. With respect to antioxidant activity, a number of questions do exists. Generally, all the plants and its extracts possesses antioxidant activities due to commonly occurring flavonoids and phenolic compounds. First of all, the presence of an antioxidant potential does not guarantee a valid or authentic activity always. Especially for those studies where the protocols involves merely a competitive bleaching of probe (Crocin bleaching assay, ORAC assay), reaction with different probe (TOSC assay) or indirect methods for reduction or oxidation of persistent radicals (DPPH, TEAC, FRAP etc.). An extensive data is available where the researcher claims an antioxidant potential based on aforementioned protocols. In fact, these models are not reproducible pharmacologically when applied in vivo or in human models. Current study is one of such examples. It is very interesting to see the antioxidant and antiglycating potential for this plant, however, data at such level is very na\u00efve and preliminary for any conclusion. The debate regarding antioxidant potential always exists as every plant and its extract have some phenolic and flavonoid moiety imparting antioxidant potential to plants.

In addition, lack of bulk plant material and insufficient support from the government due to less available toxic data may pose difficulties for the plant to be used as an ideal insecticidal drug. Various studies regarding formulations are required to address the sustained effect, quality and stability of C. serrata.

The chloroform fraction of the bark extract showed significant in-vitro cytotoxic activity with a CC 50 value of 23.78 \u03bcg/ml. Similarly, n-hexane fraction of the leaves extract showed significant cytotoxic activity with a CC 50 value of 23.99 \u03bcg/ml (Ahmad et al., 2013) . Gallic acid, a phenolic compound extracted from C. serrata leaves has also shown in vitro cytotoxic activity against prostate cancer. This compound has shown its activity against DU145 prostate cancer cells via different mechanisms including; mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, generation of reactive oxygen species and inhibition of DU145 cells growth at G2/M phase (Chen et al., 2009) . Additionally, C. serrata crude leave extract has shown in vitro cytotoxic activity against lung cancer. The crude leave extract induced the activation of caspase-3-like proteases enzymes leading to apoptosis of A549 cells. Also, the extract showed anti-proliferative activity through the interferance with cyclin D1 and cyclin E expression (Chang et al., 2002) . Similarly, the phenolic components of C. serrata leaves showed antiproliferative and apoptotic activity against human premyelocytic leukemia (HL-60 cells). Phenolic components of C. serrata exerted their apoptotic activity against HL-60 cells through various mechanisms including; caspase 3 activation, release of cytochrome c, specific proteolytic cleavage of PARP, also known as poly ADP-ribose polymerase, generation of reactive oxygen species (H 2 O 2 ) and reduction of Bcl-2 levels (Yang et al., 2006) (Kakumu et al., 2014) . Additionally, its in vitro and ex vivo activity against ovarian cancer cells has been established. C. serrata aqueous leaves extract has inhibited the growth of SKOV3 cells at G2/M phase, establishing its in vitro antiproliferative activity . Similar studies also established C. serrata in vitro cytotoxic activity against oral squamous carcinoma cells, cervical carcinoma (Chia et al., 2010) (Zhen et al., 2014) .",

Very limited information of cytotoxicity is provided for this plant. By no means, such data can provide satisfactory evidence to implicate the plant for any cancer or cancer-related complications. An extensive data consisting of proper in vitro and in vivo models, dose range, safety, mechanism of action and relevancy of target to be treated is much needed. As mentioned previously, first of all the role of solvent used may be sorted. Herein the solvent used fpor extraction is a toxic halogenated solvent i.e. chloroform. Halogenated solvents are well known for toxicity and death even at very low solvent ratio. Furthermore, cytotoxicity studies does not involve such solvent for data generation. It is better to perform such activities using DMSO in allowed and specified concentration. More importantly, molecular mechanism needs to be elaborated and a series of cell lines may be studies at various dose levels involving lowest to highest dose concentration. Proper pharmacological and toxicological guidelines are available where the toxicity potential is studied in in vitro experiments first. Following in vitro experiments the extracts are studied animal toxicity models using histological and immunohistochemistry studies. Hence, the plant needs much attention on this aspect as the data may not justify its cytotoxic and hence it's further use as an agent for the treatment of cancer. The very preliminary cell culture studies may decide a track for this plant extract, whether to utilize and study it for further anti-cancer studies. The simple cytotoxicity potential may not be sufficient to put the plant in the list of cancer treatment drugs.",
