Institutions are also required by the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 5 to plan, write and implement an animal care and use program based on the Guide. In 2011, the eighth edition of the Guide 3 was published, updating the 1996 edition 4 . In 2012, the US National Institutes of Health adopted the eighth edition of the Guide, and OLAW began requiring assured institutions to use this edition as the basis for their animal care and use programs by 31 December 2012.",

One area of particular interest is the improvement of animal welfare through provision of optimal housing. The following statement is included under the heading 'General Considerations for All Animals' in the eighth edition of the Guide 3 : \"At a minimum, animals must have enough space to express their natural postures and postural adjustments without touching the enclosure walls or ceiling, be able to turn around, and have ready access to food and water. In addition, there must be sufficient space to comfortably rest away from areas soiled by urine and feces. \" The last sentence includes a slight change in the language from the seventh edition 4 : \"[an animal]\u2026must have enough clean bedded or unobstructed area to move and rest in. \" The change removes the subjective determination of what constitutes a \"clean bedded\" area, defining it specifically as an area free of feces and urine.",

During an OLAW online seminar titled \"NIH Adopts 8th Edition of the Guide: The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (the Guide) recommends that terrestrial mammals be provided space free of urine and feces in which to rest. To evaluate the feasibility of meeting this recommendation, the author examined the availability of feces-free resting areas in standard rodent cages over time. Adult rodents (C57Bl/6J mice and Wistar rats) were housed singly, in pairs or in trios in shoebox cages at densities that met the space recommendations of the Guide. As housing density increased, the availability of unsoiled resting space declined. For C57Bl/6J mice housed singly, in pairs or in trios, most cages lacked unsoiled resting area within 3-6 days (depending on cage size), 2 days or 1 day, respectively. Similarly, for Wistar rats housed singly, in pairs or in trios, most cages lacked adequate unsoiled resting space within 3 days, 2 days or 1 day, respectively. Because most cages lacked adequate unsoiled resting space within 3 days of housing animals, the author concludes that standard cage change frequencies of once a week for adult C57Bl/6J mice and twice a week for adult Wistar rats may be inadequate to provide unsoiled resting areas for rodents.",

Adequate resting space was defined as an area in which each of the rodents in the cage could lie down either curled up or stretched out without contacting fecal material: approximately 25 cm 2 for a mouse and 150 cm 2 for a rat. During evaluations, cages were disturbed as little as possible to prevent redistribution of bedding and feces as a result of animal movements. Cages were evaluated visually from above and below because feces frequently dropped through the bedding material and settled on the cage floor. During the evaluation procedure, the observer removed the cage from the rack and removed the lids of individually ventilated cages. He then examined the cage from above and noted whether adequate feces-free resting space was available using the estimated areas given above. He then examined the cage from below and similarly noted the availability of unsoiled resting space from this perspective. For cages housing mice, the observer also examined the nesting material and bedding below it and noted whether feces were present in the nest. Finally, he replaced the lids on individually ventilated cages and returned each cage to the rack.

Similarly, for Wistar rats housed singly, in pairs or in trios, most cages lacked adequate unsoiled resting space within 3 days, 2 days or 1 day, respectively. Most cages lacked adequate unsoiled resting space within 3 days of housing animals, confirming the hypothesis that the standard cage-change frequencies of once weekly for mice and twice weekly for rats are inadequate to meet the recommendation of the Guide to provide feces-free areas for resting. The results of this study suggest that cage-change intervals of 3 days for singly housed mice, 2 days for pair-or trio-housed mice, 1-2 days for singly and pair-housed rats and less than 1 day for trio-housed rats would be needed to meet this recommendation. Even with this high cage-change frequency, some cages may not have adequate unsoiled resting space available and may require spot changes.",

Rodents, even singly housed mice, did not appear to use a specific area in their cages for defecation. They did appear to use certain areas in cages more frequently for urination, although they may also have urinated in other areas. The results of this study also do not support the notion that rodents make their nest away from toileting areas. In this study, in cages with available resting areas, feces were present in the nesting area of mice in 59% of cage observations, refuting the hypothesis that mice would not defecate in their nests. Instead, the mice defecated in their nesting areas, defecated randomly in their cages or built their nests where they defecated. These observations call into question the idea that mice and rats have an aversion to feces as humans and some other animals do. Because they are coprophagic animals, one might not expect fecal aversion to be a normal characteristic of rodents. It is not known whether or how the availability of feces-free resting areas affects rodent welfare.",

Within 7 days, there was no feces-free resting area available for the mice (this parameter was not evaluated by the authors but is apparent from the figures included in the paper) 6 .

First, I examined cages with only adult animals including one mouse strain and one rat stock and limited cage variables and bedding types, bedding depth and the presence of nesting material. Results of studies using animals of different stocks, strains, ages or weights; different housing densities; different bedding materials or depths; or different environmental enrichment items could vary. Despite this limitation, I believe the results are applicable to other strains and stocks of mice and rats because of their general similarities in defecation behavior. Second, in order to evaluate the individually ventilated mouse cages, the observer removed the cage lid, which could have disturbed the mice and led to distribution of feces in the bedding. I did not consider this to be a confounding variable because the mice were typically sleeping when the cage lid was removed and moved only after the lid had been lifted, leading to minimal disruption of the feces. Rats could and did move both bedding and feces within their cages, even without human disturbance. Third, when evaluating the presence of feces in rodent cages, the observer included feces that were buried in the bedding, reasoning that an animal lying down on bedding containing feces would have contact with the feces, which would be considered unacceptable. Others might reason that feces in bedding are not in contact with animals and should not be considered to occupy the resting space. Finally, this study did not directly examine behavior or physiology of the rodents.",

This study suggested that cage-change intervals of 1-3 days, shorter than the standard intervals of 4-14 days commonly used in animal facilities, would be required in order to meet this recommendation. But the lack of available unsoiled resting areas associated with cage-change intervals of 14 days or longer does not appear to affect the behavior or physiology of mice and rats [6] [7] [8] [9] . Furthermore, the increased cage-change frequency that would be needed to meet the recommendation could have negative effects on rodent welfare by leading to increased stress [16] [17] [18] . Therefore, the recommendation of the Guide to provide resting space free of urine or feces for rodents may not be a reasonable expectation and furthermore may not serve to improve animal welfare. This recommendation needs to be further investigated. Studies on rodents' preference for cages with or without feces and on the behavioral and physiological changes that may be associated with the availability of unsoiled resting space should be carried out. Established husbandry standards should be used to determine appropriate cage-change frequencies for rodents in laboratory animal facilities.
