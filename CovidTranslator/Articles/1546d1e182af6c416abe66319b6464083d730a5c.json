Therefore rapid and proper diagnosis for both the presence of the causative agent, feline coronavirus (FCoV) and the manifestation of feline infectious peritonitis is of paramount importance. In the present work, a novel real-time RT-PCR method is described which is able to detect FCoV and to determine simultaneously the quantity of the viral RNA. The new assay combines the M gene subgenomic messenger RNA (sg-mRNA) detection and the quantitation of the genome copies of FCoV. In order to detect the broadest spectrum of potential FCoV variants and to achieve the most accurate results in the detection ability the new assay is applying the primer-probe energy transfer (PriProET) principle. This technology was chosen since PriProET is very robust to tolerate the nucleotide substitutions in the target area. Therefore, this technology provides a very broad-range system, which is able to detect simultaneously many variants of the virus(es) even if the target genomic regions show large scale of variations. The detection specificity of the new assay was proven by positive amplification from a set of nine different FCoV strains and negative from the tested non-coronaviral targets. Examination of faecal samples of healthy young cats, organ samples of perished animals, which suffered from feline infectious peritonitis, and cat leukocytes from uncertain clinical cases were also subjected to the assay. The sensitivity of the P-sg-QPCR method was high, since as few as 10 genome copies of FCoV were detected. The quantitative sg-mRNA detection method revealed more than 10-50,000 times increase of the M gene sg-mRNA in organ materials of feline infectious peritonitis cases, compared to those of the enteric FCoV variants present in the faeces of normal, healthy cats. These results indicate the applicability of the new P-sg-QPCR test as a powerful novel tool for the better detection and quantitation of FCoV and for the improved diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis, this important disease of the Felidae, causing serious losses in the cat populations at a global scale.",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis is currently the leading cause of infectious death among young domestic and wild Felidae. The disease has a worldwide distribution, especially in cats originated from purebred catteries (Pedersen, 1987; Foley et al., 1997) . The causative agent of feline infectious peritonitis, feline coronavirus (FCoV), belongs to the Coronaviridae family within the order Nidovirales (Almeida and Tyrell, 1967; Siddell et al., 1983) . FCoV, together with human, porcine, and canine coronaviruses is a member of alpha coronavirus genus (de Groot et al., 2008) . Regarding pathogenicity, FCoV comprises two biotypes: the feline infectious peritonitis viruses (FIPV) and the feline enteric coronaviruses (eFCoV). The existence of at least two serotypes of FCoV (types I and II) has been shown based on in vitro neutralisation assays using monoclonal antibodies. Each serotype includes viruses of both the FIPV and eFCoV biotypes (Hohdatsu et al., 1991a,b) . Type I and II viruses differ mainly in their in vitro growth characteristics, as the members of the serotype I can rarely if ever be propagated in cell-cultures. In the field, the prevalence of FCoV type I appear to be higher, as approximately 70-85% of feline infectious peritonitis cases are due to infection with type I viruses (Hohdatsu et al., 1992; Herrewegh et al., 1998; Addie et al., 2003; Kummrow et al., 2005) .",

The reliability of these diagnostic approaches were questioned due to the inconsequent correlation of the positive results and the disease outcome. Simons et al. (2005) published a more sophisticated method, targeting subgenomic mRNA (sg-mRNA) production of the virus, detected by conventional RT-PCR. This method was supposed to detect only the intensively replicating viral biotype, since viral sg-mRNAs are served to express the viral structural protein genes. However, the suitability of this test to detect FIPV was questioned by Can-Sahna et al. (2007) on the basis of the high ratio of positive results obtained from the samples of clinically healthy cats. These observations indicate that an assay capable of FCoV sg-mRNA quantitation in the different organs and body fluids would be of very high importance, considering the fact that low-level virus replication occurs even in the case of eFCoV infection (Herrewegh et al., 1997) , and hopefully the exact determination of the viral replication rate by measuring the viral sg-mRNA level would be decisive for the establishment of a correct diagnosis (de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005) .",

The novel assay is based on the FRET principle (F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer; F\u00f6rster, 1948) and uses the primer-probe energy transfer (PriProET) technology. This robust real-time PCR technology was previously successfully applied to detect a wide variety of viruses comprising vesicular disease viruses, hepatitis E virus, classical swine virus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and porcine circovirus (Rasmussen et al., 2005; Hakhverdyan et al., 2006; B\u00e1lint et al., 2009) . Compared to the most wide-spread real-time PCR system, the TaqMan method, PriProET is providing a higher flexibility in the detection of varying target nucleic acids. PriProET is able to overcome multiple mutations located in the targeted region of the viral genome and to amplify a wide range of nucleic acids despite of the variations in the targeted regions (Rasmussen et al., 2003) . This robust feature made the PriProET technique suitable for the detection of the FCoV, a highly variable RNA virus.",

In contrast, the limited number of Psg-QPCR positive results may indicate a relatively low percentage of animals with extensive virus replication level in the intestinal tract. Since the P-sg-QPCR assay is demonstrating intensive virus replication, it is tempting to speculate that this test is capable of identifying the persistent virus-shedder cats, which contribute to the maintenance CoV infection in the catteries, and their ratio can reach even 13% (Addie et al., 2003) , and this group includes the cats with the risk of the fatal FIPV variant emerging.

Hence, to avoid false negative diagnosis, negative results of the P-sg-QPCR method should be interpreted with caution, and in these cases this assay is a method of choice complementing the widely used genomic real-time QPCR assays in the determination of FCoV status. Another explanation for the surprisingly low copy number of the FCoV sg-mRNA in the gut may be explained with the balanced immune response of the host animals that keeps FCoV replication at low level, and as a consequence, the subgenomic RNA levels may reach much lower rates then their genomic counterparts. Whichever explanation is true, evaluation of quantitative PCR results has to take into consideration the inhibitory compounds of the faecal samples (Dye et al., 2008) . The different melting point values of the faecal samples indicating variable number of nucleotide substitutions at the probe-binding site (Rasmussen et al., 2003; Hakhverdyan et al., 2006) revealed at least four different FCoV virus genetic variants in the targeted region of the M gene. Comparing these melting points with those of the reference viruses it can be concluded that the most frequent virus types in the Swedish collection may be the UCD1like, the 79-1683-like FCoV, the NOR15 and 144/01 CCoV strains. Although recombination cannot be excluded in some of this FCoVs the majority of the viruses detected must correspond with these strains, because the M gene is the most conserved structural protein gene.",

The negative results in the case of a few samples are supposed to be a consequence of the different distribution of FIPV in various organs. The most frequently affected organs are the liver, the lungs, the kidneys and mesenteric lymph nodes with 90-100% positive result rate. This is a reflection of their dense vascularisation, rendering them particularly susceptible to the virus that is transported by the infected monocytes and macrophages. A slight difference was observed in the same organs regarding their sg-mRNA contents, where the order of frequency was: mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, lungs and liver ranging from 100% to 75% positive result. Concluded by their enhanced sg-mRNA content these are the main susceptible organs, which the FCoV possessing its altered genome can first colonise and then intensively multiply.",

Interestingly, the basic organ of FCoV replication the gut, displays virus depletion in all examined feline infectious peritonitis cases, the maximal virus replication occurred at a remarkably low level, never even exceeding 1000 copy numbers. These data suggest that the mutated FCoV variants are prone to abandon this organ after acquiring successful access to other organs via monocytes and macrophages. The interesting phenomenon that the same melting point detected in the different organs within the body may be explained by the absence of concomitant CoV infection.",
