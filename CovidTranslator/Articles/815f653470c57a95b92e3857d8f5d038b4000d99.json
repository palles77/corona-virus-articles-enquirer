During the formation of the coronaviral replication/transcription complex (RTC), essential steps include processing of the conserved polyprotein nsp7-10 region by the main protease M pro and subsequent complex formation of the released nsp's. Here, we analyzed processing of the coronavirus nsp7-10 region using native mass spectrometry showing consumption of substrate, rise and fall of intermediate products and complexation. Importantly, there is a clear order of cleavage efficiencies, which is influenced by the polyprotein tertiary structure. Furthermore, the predominant product is an nsp7+8(2:2) hetero-tetramer with nsp8 scaffold. In conclusion, native MS, opposed to other methods, can expose the processing dynamics of viral polyproteins and the landscape of protein interactions in one set of experiments. Thereby, new insights into protein interactions, essential for generation of viral progeny, were provided, with relevance for development of antivirals.",

The replicase gene ORF 1ab occupies two thirds of the CoV single-strand (+)sense RNA genome. Initially, ORF1ab is directly translated into either replicase polyprotein pp1a (nsp1-11) or pp1ab (nsp1-16), depending on a ribosomal (-1)-frameshift [3] . Subsequently, the polyproteins undergo proteolytic processing into 11 or 16 individual nsp's. Eventually, the nsp's take part in forming the RTC, a membrane-anchored, highly dynamic protein-RNA complex facilitating the replicative processes [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

This is particularly interesting for nsp8-9, because of its Coronaviridaewide conserved NNE motif at P1'-P3'. Previously, it was suggested that this motif could confer poor substrate properties to the nsp8-9 cleavage site, which would result in a considerable influence on processing order and RTC assembly [16] . In fact, two observations made by other researchers provide indication for a peptide-specific effect: Fan et al. analyzed the secondary structure of nsp peptides and observed that nsp8-9, comprising the NNE motif and closely resembling the FPS8-9 tested here, had a higher propensity for \u03b1-helices than other nsp peptides [26, 27] . Moreover, Chuck et al. reported that \u03b2-strands in substrates promote binding to M pro [28] . The results shown in our work indicate that the structural layout of the cleavage site is different when comparing peptide to full-length protein, which plays a role in endowing the nsp8-9 cleavage site with decent cleavability. Since the full-length protein possesses the structural environment of the cleavage sites, we consider results with this substrate more relevant for studying the processing pattern of the CoV polyprotein.",

Thereby, covalent processing intermediates were distinguished from newly formed complexes, for instance nsp7-8 intermediate and nsp7+8(1:1) dimer overlap in mass spectra ( Figure S 3) . Most importantly, we identified an nsp7+8 (2:2) complex, undescribed before, and subject to detailed analysis later on. Here, this complex' intensity in native MS remained low, most likely due to interference by the noncleavable His-tag N-terminal of nsp7. Furthermore, homo-dimers of nsp7 and nsp9 were found ( Figure   S 4) . The MFs of nsp9 monomers and dimers (AVG\u00b1SD, N=3; 75\u00b111% and 25\u00b12%, respectively) were determined, based on the intensity ratio of the assigned peaks. Although, the X-ray structure of nsp9 was reported as a dimer, its low abundance found here is consistent with a low dimer affinity in solution [29] .

For cleaving the precursor, 2 \u00b5M SARS-CoV M pro was incubated with 14 \u00b5M SARS-CoV nsp7-9-His (ratio ~1:7) at 4\u00b0C in 300 mM NH 4 OAc, 1 mM DTT at pH 8.0 overnight.Finally, the complex of nsp7+8 was investigated in detail. In order to promote interactions of nsp's with authentic amino acid sequence, we engineered a SARS-CoV nsp7-9-His containing a cleavable His-tag at the C-terminus. Upon processing of this substrate by M pro , we tested the landscape of mass species via native MS. Peak envelopes were detected for the monomeric products nsp7, nsp8 and nsp9 as well as for M pro monomer and dimer. While nsp9 did not interact with any of the other subunits, even after cleavage of the tag, nsp7+8 formed a hetero-tetramer of nsp7+8(2:2) (62.2 kDa) (Figure 4). This stoichiometry was predicted based on the molecular weights of the subunits (2\u00d79.3 kDa + 2\u00d721.8 kDa = 62.2 kDa). However, for further evidence, molecular ions of three different charge states of the putative nsp7+8 hetero-tetramer (4449 m/z, +14; 4153 m/z, +15; 2893 m/z, +16) (Figure 5 A) were selected as precursor and subjected to CID-MS/MS. To successively induce subunit dissociation, we increased the collision voltage (CV) stepwise. Thereby, the overall dissociation pattern was exposed (Figure 5 A and Figure S 9), which confirmed the hetero-tetrameric (2:2) complex stoichiometry.Two alternative dissociation pathways revealed the arrangement of subunits within the complex(Figure 5 B).

To calculate kinetic parameters, triplicate measurements were performed.The fluorescence coefficients k sx were used to convert the initial increase of AFU into the initial reaction rate, which was then normalized by c Mpro to rate/[Enzyme]. For comparing substrate specificities, the rates/[Enzyme] were plotted against the substrate concentrations c X,S resulting in process curves. The slopes of the process curves correspond to the apparent k cat /K M .The influence of salt conditions on enzyme activity was determined by incubating 20 \u00b5L M pro (final concentration 0.1 \u00b5M) with 80 \u00b5M FRET peptide substrate FPS4-5 (final concentration 1 \u00b5M) in varying NH 4 OAc (10% Glycerol, pH7.5 and 50 mM, 165 mM, 280 mM, 395 mM, 510 mM, 625 mM, 740 mM, 855 mM, 970 mM, 1085 mM and 1200 mM) and NaCl (50 mM HEPES, 10% Glycerol, pH 7.5 and 0 mM, 120 mM, 240 mM, 360 mM, 480 mM, 600 mM, 720 mM, 840 mM, 960 mM, 1080 mM and 1200 mM).
