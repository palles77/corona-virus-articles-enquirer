Washes and flocked swabs collected from children < 3 years old hospitalized with a lower respiratory tract infection were tested for parainfluenza virus 1-3, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B and metapneumovirus (Group 1) and adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus (Group 2) using realtime reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR). A consensuses standard was used to determine sensitivity and compare cycle thresholds (C T ) of washes and flocked swabs for each virus and group of viruses. Sensitivities ranged from 79 to 89% and 69 to 94% for flocked swabs and washes, respectively, excluding AdV which had a sensitivity of 35% for flocked swabs. When the flocked swabs and washes of Group 1 viruses were collected on the day of admission, the sensitivity of both sample types was 100%. Wash specimens had a lower C T value and higher sensitivity than flocked swabs; however there was no statistical difference in the sensitivity of a flocked swab (89%) versus wash (93%) for the detection of Group 1 viruses, particularly when samples were collected on the same day. Flocked swabs may be a useful alternative to washes for detection of respiratory viruses in clinical settings.",

            "text": "Respiratory viruses are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The type and timing of sample collection in relation to onset of symptoms is crucial in the detection of these infections (Meerhoff et al., 2010; Moore et al., 2008) . In a clinical setting, the current standard specimen collection method for viral respiratory testing is a nasopharyngeal wash (wash) (Abu-Diab et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2008; Esposito et al., 2010; Heikkinen et al., 2002; Macfarlane et al., 2005) . Obtaining a wash can be uncomfortable for the patient and requires specialized training and equipment for the provider, limiting widespread use in outpatient clinical practice. Viral specimens can also be collected using rayon nasopharyngeal swabs (swabs). These are often preferred by health care providers and patients; however, some groups have reported that swabs have a lower sensitivity than washes for collection of some viruses, which limits their clinical use (Heikkinen et al., 2002; Macfarlane et al., 2005; Spyridaki et al., 2008; Stensballe et al., 2002) . Studies suggest that nasopharyngeal flocked swabs (flocked swabs) may be a better alternative to conventional rayon swabs (Abu-Diab et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2008; Daley et al., 2006; Walsh et al., 2008) . Flocked swabs have a spray-on nylon flocked fiber technology allowing for improved collection and release of patient sample (Abu-Diab et al., 2008) .",

Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is faster with greater sensitivity than antigen tests and culture (Erdman et al., 2003; Kuypers et al., 2009; van Kraaij et al., 2005) . rRT-PCR results are interpreted as cycle threshold (C T ) values which are the number of cycles needed to detect the amplified genetic target at a given threshold. A lower C T value means earlier detection and implies more virus is present. The C T value is a relative measure of viral load and can be used to compare samples processed with the same assay when reagents and instrumentation are equal.",

On admission to the hospital, washes were collected by respiratory therapists or nurses as part of routine clinical practice to diagnose the child's illness. 2 mL of normal saline were instilled into one naris simultaneously using wall suction to collect fluid from the nasopharynx through the opposite naris. A flocked swab (FloQSwab, Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) was inserted into the nasopharynx and specimen was obtained from the patient after informed consent was given by the patient's parent or legal guardian. Flocked swabs were always collected after the washes. The flocked swab and 1.0 mL of the wash were placed in Nalgene \u00ae cryovials containing 1.0 and 1.5 mL respectively, of RNA stabilizing buffer containing guanidinium thiocyanate (MagNA pure LC total nucleic acid isolation; Roche) and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C.

The flocked swab is advantageous for collection because additional devices are not needed and patients tend to tolerate nasopharyngeal swabs better than washes (Walsh et al., 2010) . Nasopharyngeal swabs using traditional rayon tipped swabs have had unacceptable sensitivity compared with washes; however, the flocked swab has a design that improves the collection and yield of nasopharyngeal epithelial cells thereby increasing diagnostic yield over rayon tipped swabs (Daley et al., 2006; Esposito et al., 2010) .",

We did not perform viral culture or antigen detection; therefore we are limited to reporting consensus sensitivity rather than sensitivity versus a gold standard. Additionally, the use of rRT-PCR has increased in clinical laboratories but many still only use culture or antigen detection. It would be useful to investigate how the flocked swab performs with these more traditional testing methods. However, rRT-PCR sensitivity and specificity for these viruses has been evaluated versus culture by others (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Kuypers et al., 2009; van Kraaij et al., 2005) . An analysis comparing the two collection methods according to the time delay in obtaining the flocked swab is limited by the absence of the exact time of specimen collection. A single calendar day of difference could represent 1-47 h difference in the collection times. The high concordance between wash and flocked swab samples collected on the same day is reassuring with regard to the similar sensitivity of the two methods. However, the uncertainty in our time of collection data could mask real differences in the two tests separated by larger periods of time. Evaluation of how wash and flocked swabs compared among children of different ages and with different durations of illness was not done. This study did not include older children/adults and immunocompromised patients where viral shedding is commonly lower so it is unclear how the flocked swab would perform in those populations.",
