            "text": "Whereas considerable attention has been devoted to achieving high levels of influenza immunization, the importance of this issue is magnified by concern over pandemic influenza. Most recommendations for vaccine administration address high risk groups such as the elderly and those with chronic diseases, but coverage for hardto-reach (HTR) populations has had less attention. HTR populations include minorities but also include other primarily urban groups such as undocumented immigrants, substance users, the homeless, and homebound elderly. Obstacles to the provision of immunization to HTR populations are present at the patient, provider, and structural levels. Strategies at the individual level for increasing immunization coverage include community-based educational campaigns to improve attitudes and increase motivation for receiving vaccine; at the provider level, education of providers to encourage immunizations, improving patient-provider interactions, broadening the provider base to include additional nurses and pharmacists, and adoption of standing orders for immunization administration; and at the structural level, promoting wider availability of and access to vaccine. The planning process for an influenza pandemic should include community engagement and extension of strategies beyond traditional providers to involve community-based organizations addressing HTR populations.",

[8] [9] [10] Annually and in pandemic situations, vaccine supply may be inadequate to meet the national need, and ramp-up of production is complex. 11 A minimum of 3 to 6 months is needed to design and start manufacturing a vaccine based on a new virus strain and using current production methods, there are insufficient supplies of eggs to make sufficient vaccine to meet the demand. [12] [13] [14] An influenza pandemic would cause particularly acute problems in HTR populations. Even if sufficient vaccine against the pandemic strain could be made, gaining timely access to and rapid immunizations of HTR populations would pose significant challenges.",

            "text": "A number of interventions have been shown to be effective for increasing vaccination coverage among the general population, including provider-based interventions, and interventions aimed at increasing community demand and enhancing access to immunization services. 15 Studies on how best to immunize HTR populations are sparse and suffer from difficulty determining the true size of the populations at risk. 16 Existing research suggests, however, that most interventions are strengthened by multiple approaches, particularly those that are community-based. 7, 17 DEFINING HARD-TO-REACH POPULATIONS High-risk populations for influenza include the elderly and those with certain chronic diseases. High risk is not the same as HTR, although there appears to be substantial overlap; whereas not all at high risk are hard-to-reach, many in the HTR population are at high risk. While no uniform definition of HTR populations exists, HTR populations have typically been defined from the perspective of linkage with the health care system, i.e., persons who do not seek treatment in traditional care settings such as provider offices or clinics. The size of hard-to-reach populations, whereas hard to estimate, is not trivial; some examples of constituent groups are as follows: 11.5-12 million undocumented immigrants nationwide, 18 1.5 million injection drug users in 96 large U.S. metropolitan areas 19 and 744,000 homeless persons nationwide, 20 as well as a proportion of the elderly and minorities. Overall, the percentage of U.S. residents at high risk for influenza but who are not immunized has been estimated to be as high as 65%. 3 Failure to be immunized is related to lack of health insurance and to having a regular provider; 21 this may be a particular concern for specific HTR groups. For example, mobile elderly differ from the majority of the other population groups in that they are covered by Medicare and generally frequent a health care provider. Thus, whereas the elderly as a high-risk group may differ from other groups in terms of access to health care as an entitlement, a proportion is not connected to care and is therefore HTR. The lack of a regular health care provider is correlated with race and ethnicity. 7 While 80% of White adults have a primary care provider, the percentage is closer to 70% for Asian-Americans and Blacks, and only 57% for Hispanics. 22 As reviewed elsewhere, other barriers to accessing care include culturally derived attitudes and belief systems, negative experiences with past treatment, language and other barriers in patient-provider relationships, and legal status (e.g., undocumented immigrants). [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Some groups harbor substantial myths about and distrust of the medical system; previous research has shown that their attitudes appear to be strong predictors of being immunized. 28 VLAHOV ET AL. 616",

Another study showed that unvaccinated individuals also believed that they were unlikely to get the flu. 23 Other reasons for not receiving immunization include fear of needles and fear of getting sick from the vaccine. 23, 26, 36 Lack of trust in modern medicine, belief in home remedies, and lack of trust in the government also may discourage immunization. 25 The perceived attitudes of peers also relates strongly to likelihood of immunization. In one study, whereas 75% to 80% of immunized individuals thought that their family and friends were in favor of their getting immunized against influenza, only about 40% of unvaccinated people thought so. 28 Challenges on the Provider Level Only about one-third to one-half of health care workers are immunized against influenza and providers who do not believe the vaccine is protective are less likely to recommend it to patients. 31, 37 In addition, monitoring of immunization status is generally poor. Most providers have little knowledge of how many of their patients are at high risk and especially need influenza vaccine, 32 and few providers have systematic methods to assure immunization among their patients (Table 1) . 32, 38 As HTR populations generally have little interaction with providers on a regular basis, opportunities to identify challenges or to identify factors for influence are limited.",

Legal and regulatory obstacles in coordinating distribution among bordering jurisdictions and handling liability issues can be barriers to mounting complicated community-based vaccination programs.

One report showed that from 1995 to 1999, in states where pharmacists provided vaccination, rates increased from 58% to 68% vs. 61% to 65% in states that did not explicitly allow pharmacists to vaccinate. 51 This is a strategy that could be particularly helpful for HTR populations. Similar increases have also been reported in settings where nurses were given the authority to vaccinate without the presence of a physician. 39 Strategies at the Structural Level At the structural level, a limited vaccine supply is problematic. 52 Technological solutions are being sought, for example, shifting the industrial growth of the virus from eggs to cell cultures. 53 Technology is also being used to stretch the doses of available immunizations, including the use of adjuvants or intradermal injection. 54 Vaccinators also need liability protection. 55 The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) was designed to provide the needed indemnification at the national level. However, the program does not currently include a specific indemnification program for vaccines against a pandemic influenza strain.",

Because vaccine stockpiles are limited, months will likely pass before supply can be increased to meet the demand. As priorities must be established in advance, the Health and Human Services Pandemic Influenza Plan and the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza are beginning to address prioritization issues. 63, 64 Although advance planning and training for distribution are critical, not every contingency can be anticipated on a theoretical basis. A number of lessons have been learned from preparedness exercises and from previous epidemics. First, at the individual level, the long wait time required for the large number of persons that will need to be vaccinated in the shortest period poses a major challenge (Table  3) . 65 Second, personnel dedicated to this effort are needed; identifying and locating HTR populations in this situation becomes more difficult if staff are diverted to other venues. Third, at the provider level, long wait times may necessitate the expansion of the provider pool to include additional nurses and pharmacists. 63, 66 And finally, reports have shown that maintaining adequate documentation under crisis conditions, especially for research purposes, may be challenging. 63, 67 Challenges at the structural level are even more pronounced. The domestic supply of influenza vaccine for A (H5N1) strain of concern is limited; the current annual capacity in the U.S. could manufacture enough vaccine for only 15 million Americans, leaving the vast majority vulnerable to disease. 63 Preparedness drills have shown that special consideration should be given to first responders (e.g., health care workers, emergency medical volunteers). In preparedness exercises, providers and their families have requested that they be given prophylactic vaccination ahead of time to increase their ability to participate after an outbreak (Gebbie, K., Columbia University School of Nursing, personal communication). Other high-priority groups include those at risk for severe disease: elderly, children, those with chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, and immunosuppressed individuals. Points of distribution should be determined in advance based on their ability to handle large numbers of people (Table 3) . 63 These locations, which will most likely have to be flexible based on the exigencies of the situation and which, of necessity, have to favor access for the easy-to-reach masses, may be challenging for some HTR populations to access, especially those with limited mobility, distrust of government, or other constraints.",

At the structural level, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) have developed guidelines for prioritizing groups to be immunized in the case of a pandemic, guidelines which will have to be communicated to those responsible for the actual immunization. 63 Educational materials targeted specifically to HTR populations should be developed in collaboration with community stakeholders and pilot tested in advance.

[69] [70] [71] Preparedness exercises sponsored by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH) found that just-in-time training for vaccinators can be delivered through hospitals or other points of distribution, 72 but vaccinators need to be taught which groups need vaccination as well as how to vaccinate. Results of a drill in New York showed appropriate patient triage in the range of 90% or better after just-in-time training (Weisfuse, I., NYCDOHMH, personal communication). Interestingly, findings from another study showed that hospitals appeared to have more difficulty after rigid protocols and were less able to adapt quickly to a line-of-command system than other venues (Gebbie, K., Columbia University School of Nursing, personal communication). Because of limited resources and the special efforts needed to reach underserved populations, these populations may be less likely to receive vaccines in pandemic situations. Points of distribution familiar to community members should be favored. Sites may include community-based clinics, senior centers, hospitals, pharmacies, employee health services, migrant worksites, locations where day laborers congregate, homeless shelters, soup kitchens, churches, grocery stores, universities, public schools, and daycare centers. 63, 67, 72 ",
