That helps the bacteria to survive with an inhibited immune response.

The reduction in EspK leads to the inhibited secretion of EspB, ESAT-6, and CFP-10 protein.

Duration of each injection was set as 3.6s, and spacing between each successive injection was fixed at 90 s. Ligand heats of dilution were determined by injecting the same concentration of TMPyP4 into the potassium phosphate buffer and subtracted from the binding isotherms before curve fitting. Data were acquired and analyzed by using origin scientific software version 7 (MicroCal Software Inc.) to generate thermograms. Thermograms were fitted to a two sites binding model for association constant (K a ) determination.",

Two-fold serial dilutions of TMPyP4(dissolved in water) were prepared and Mtb culture (above) was treated with the compound dilutions in a 96-well plate (200 \u00b5L final volume) for 7 days at 37\u00b0C.

Nucleic acid quantification was done using nanodrop (yield and A280/260). qPCR analysis of DNA free RNA as described previously. 4 Briefly, reverse transcription was carried out using High capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) in a 20 \u00b5l reaction. qPCR was subsequently carried out in PCR master reaction mix containing 1x iQ SYBR Green Super Mix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA), 0.5 \u00b5M of each primer and 2 \u00b5l of cDNA sample in a final reaction volume of 25 \u00b5l in a 96 well PCR plate in BioRad C1000 Thermal Cycler. 16S rRNA was used as a normalizing control and its Cq values were used as an indicator of RNA integrity. BioRad CFX96 software was used for analysis. Absolute quantification of transcripts was done using dilutions of genomic DNA to construct a standard. All experiments were performed in quadruplets (2 biological and 2 technical replicates) and student's t-test was applied for statistical analysis. Primers used are listed in Table III .
