Molecular POC tests could be a valuable alternative. Objectives: To evaluate the first influenza molecular POC test commercially available, the Cepheid Xpert Flu A Panel designed to simultaneously detect influenza A virus and subtype A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic virus, and compare it with in-house real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Study design: Clinical specimens positive for influenza virus and influenza virus isolates with different viral loads and of different type and subtype were used to determine the analytical reactivity and sensitivity. A panel of pathogen negative specimens and isolates of 19 different respiratory pathogens were used to determine the analytical specificity.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] A major drawback, however, of POC antigenic tests is their relative insensitivity and hence unsuitability for individual patient diagnosis without additional (confirmatory) tests. 2,3 Therefore, a need for more sensitive POC tests arose, in particular for diagnosing infections with the highly fatal A(H5N1) influenza virus. 5 Although real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) is rapid it needs expensive equipment, a well suited laboratory and trained personnel for RNA purification and RT-PCR reagent preparation and still takes about 4 hours. 1, 3 The main bottle-neck in developing POC qRT-PCR has been sample preparation. 6 . They all combine sample preparation with single or multiplex qRT-PCR in a closed system and an assay can be completed within an hour. A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic virus was included in these assays as POC qRT-PCR systems could be particular useful for on-site triage and for rapid and easy diagnosis during off-office hours.

            "text": "Our analytical evaluation shows the potential of the Xpert Flu A Panel to become a real POC molecular test, however, some limitations were determined. The Xpert Flu A Panel does detect human influenza A viruses including the A(H1N1) 2009 variant with an analytical sensitivity similar to our qRT-PCR, however, some low viral load specimens were not detected. In addition, viral load limitation was particularly noticed for avian influenza viruses A(H5N1) and A(H5N2), whilst A(H9N2) was not detected at all. This is an important limitation as there is an urgent need for molecular POC tests detecting avian influenza viruses. 5 The Xpert Flu A Panel H1 2009 test was found specific for the H gene of the A(H1N1) 2009 virus and was able to subtype all A(H1N1) 2009 virus containing specimens that were found positive in the matrix test of the Xpert Flu A Panel. However, all specimens with repeatable inconsistent A(H1N1) 2009 results in the qRT-PCR were not detected in the Xpert Flu A Panel. Sequencing of the primer and probe targets of the qRT-PCR of these viruses revealed that there were some mismatches explaining the incon- sistent results (not shown). As the primer and probe binding targets included in the Xpert Flu A Panel were not revealed by Cepheid it was impossible to determine whether lack of performance with some specimens was caused by mismatching of primers and/or probes. Drift of influenza viruses necessitates regular updating of primers and probes and especially quick updating is needed when a virus with mutated primer or probe binding site becomes the dominant virus in a season. Emergency use authorisation of commercial influenza molecular tests might overcome this problem, however, even emergency development and validation might take longer than a season lasts. Therefore, molecular POC can never fully replace in-house qRT-PCR for detection and identification of influenza viruses.",

However, the Xpert Flu A Panel is a welcome alternative to antigenic rapid tests in large practices and to qRT-PCR in laboratories for emergency diagnostics during off-office hours. To become really useful as POC test, especially in areas where avian influenza viruses infecting humans are endemic, the Xpert Flu A Panel should be improved for detection of all influenza A viruses and for determination of relevant subtypes.",
