Two liters of Rosetta2(DE3) cells containing the recombinant MERS-PLpro gene were grown to an OD 600 of 0.65 at 37 \u00b0C in LB medium. The cells were then induced with 0.5 mM IPTG for 15 hours at 25 \u00b0C. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (1 mg mL -1 lysozyme and protease inhibitor cocktail in buffer A: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole, and 5 mM \u03b2mercaptoethanol). The His-tag fused MERS-PLpro was purified by a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) with a gradient of buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM Imidazole, and 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol). The pooled MERS-PLpro was then dialyzed with buffer A without imidazole and the His-tag was cleaved by 2 units mg -1 of HRV 3C protease (Novagen) overnight at 4 \u00b0C, producing a MERS-PLpro with only two extra residues (GP) at the N-terminus. Finally, MERS-PLpro was again loaded onto the HisTrap column to remove HRV protease, cleaved His-tags, and uncleaved His-tagged MERS-PLpro. MERS-PLpro was then further purified by Superdex 75 size exclusion column chromatography with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, and 1 mM TCEP. Purified protein with approximately 95% purity was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and generated protein beads for storage at -80 \u00b0C. Two MERS-PLpro mutants (N109A and N109D) were generated by mutagenesis using Q5 \u00ae Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs). Both mutants were over-expressed and purified by the same method as the wild-type MERS-PLpro.",

A series of increasing compound concentrations (0 to 200 \u00b5M final concentration at 2-fold serial dilution) in 100% DMSO were prepared. Then 3X (three times final concentration) compound solutions were prepared in assay buffer prior to assays. 8 \u00b5L of 3X enzyme solution was distributed into wells, and 8 \u00b5L of varying concentration of compounds (3X) were added and incubated for 5 minutes. The enzyme reaction was initiated by adding 8 \u00b5L of the substrate (3X), and its activity was continuously monitored for 6 minutes.

Screening was performed by sitting-drop vapor-diffusion in 96-well Greiner plates and three gradient protein concentrations (5.0, 10.0, and 13.0 mg mL -1 ) were tested. MERS-PLpro was crystallized in 1.0 M Sodium Citrate and 0.1 M Sodium Cacodylate at pH 6.5 in a twinned morphology. Optimization was conducted by grid expansion in hanging-drop vapor-diffusion in 24-well plates. Reservoir solutions were prepared in various combinations of Sodium Citrate (0.5-1.5 M, pH 6.5) and Sodium Cacodylate (0.05-0.2 M). Hanging drops were made by mixing 13.0 mg mL -1 protein with reservoir solutions at 1:1/1:2/2:1 ratios. Single crystals were picked up and soaked in a reservoir solution with 20% Sucrose (v/v) before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.",
