OBJECTIVE: To determine whether FENO levels are elevated in children with asthma exacerbations compared with baseline, and whether there is a difference in FENO levels based on PCR positive (D) (respiratory virus isolated by PCR analysis) versus PCR negative (L) (respiratory virus not isolated by PCR analysis) status. METHODS: Children with a previous FENO level measurement while stable and who presented to an urgent care facility with an asthma exacerbation were enrolled. FENO levels, spirometry, and nasal swabs for viral PCR were obtained at the time of the exacerbation and following a course of prednisone. Data were available on 66 children. Linear mixed models were used to regress the outcomes of interest (FEV 1 , FEV 1 /forced vital capacity, forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% of forced vital capacity, and natural log FENO) on detected virus (yes/no), visit (baseline, exacerbation, follow-up), and the interaction between the detected virus and visit. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, higher FENO values and lower lung function were found at the time of an exacerbation. A respiratory virus was detected in 59% of the exacerbations. The interaction between PCR (D) and PCR (L) groups and visit on log FENO was marginally significant (P [ .07). There was no difference in log FENO between the PCR (D) and PCR (L) groups at baseline, while higher log FENO was found in the PCR (L) group at the time of exacerbation and following prednisone (P [ .05 and .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Higher FENO concentration in PCR (L) exacerbations suggests an eosinophilic predominance in nonviral compared with viral exacerbations. \u00d3 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract 2015;3:913-9)",

Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) has been accepted as a noninvasive measure of airway inflammation that can be used in both the diagnosis and the management of asthma. 2, 3 Studies have shown FENO to be as effective as beta-agonist reversibility and methacholine responsiveness in diagnosing asthma in both children and adults. 4-6 FENO levels are positively correlated with bronchial wall inflammation, 7 induced-sputum eosinophilia, [8] [9] [10] and airway hyperresponsiveness. [11] [12] [13] Increases in FENO are associated with deterioration in asthma control with poor inhaled glucocorticoid (GC) adherence, 2,11 whereas FENO levels fall in a dose-dependent manner with inhaled GC treatment. 11, 12 Despite enhanced knowledge of FENO in chronic asthma, little is known regarding its role in acute asthma. In 1 of 2 recently published studies, FENO was not found to be useful in acute asthma because it could be measured only in 68% of the children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute asthma, 14 while in the second study, FENO failed to distinguish children requiring hospitalization from those who were discharged to home. 15 In neither study were FENO levels available at baseline, nor an attempt was made to determine what role viral infections played in FENO levels. The aims of this study were 2-fold: to determine whether the FENO level is elevated during an acute asthma exacerbation compared with baseline in children with persistent asthma and to determine the influence of viral infections on FENO levels in children presenting with an acute asthma exacerbation requiring prednisone therapy.",

Once consent and assent were obtained, participants completed a clinical questionnaire, spirometry, and FENO measurement and had a nasal swab obtained for viral PCR (visit 2). Urgent care physicians independently directed treatment and determined the participants' dispositions. The treating physicians were not study investigators and the decision to treat with prednisone was at the discretion of the treating physician using treatment algorithms based on the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines. 16 Participants who were discharged home were instructed to continue usual controller medications, to take albuterol at a frequency directed by the urgent care physician, and to complete a 5-to 7-day course of oral prednisone (2 mg/kg/d; maximum daily dose 60 mg). All discharged participants were also scheduled for follow-up 1 week later (visit 3). At the follow-up visit, all participants underwent spirometry and had FENO levels measured.",

The combination of vellum closure and low flow rate ensures accurate measurement of pulmonary-derived exhaled NO levels and excludes contamination from nasal NO. Participants exhale to their residual volume, insert the mouthpiece, inhale to total lung capacity, and then exhale for 10 seconds at a steady rate of 50 mL/s. Visual incentives provide feedback for flow rate compliance. The end point of measurement occurred when a plateau for 4 seconds was observed.

Linear mixed models were used to regress the outcomes of interest (FEV 1 , FEV 1 /FVC, FEF 25/75 , and natural log FENO) on detected virus (yes/no), visit (baseline, exacerbation, follow-up), and the interaction between the detected virus and visit. The interaction was the main predictor of interest in the models, and was kept in the model even if it was not statistically significant to allow for model flexibility. Covariates of interest for adjusted models were season (winter, spring, summer, and fall) and inhaled GC therapy (yes/no), and also sex, weight, height, and race (Hispanic, African American, or Caucasian) for the adjusted FENO model. Backwards selection using a P-value cutoff of .15 was used to remove insignificant covariates. Final adjusted models included season as a covariate. In addition, the adjusted FENO model contained age and race (Hispanic, African American, or Caucasian) as covariates. All models contained a random intercept. To account for repeated measures and unequal times between visits across subjects, a Spatial Power covariance structure based on days from exacerbation was used. All analyses were done in SAS version 9.4. Plots were generated in R version 3.1.0.",

[25] [26] [27] Past studies in adults with asthma have demonstrated that neutrophil-driven inflammation is not associated with elevated FENO levels. 28 The mechanisms by which viral infections contribute to changes in airway inflammation and altered physiology that result in asthma exacerbations remain incompletely understood. 29 Message et al 30 addressed this issue by inoculating those with asthma and healthy controls with human rhinovirus. Both groups developed respiratory symptoms, but those with asthma had lung function impairment and heightened bronchial responsiveness and developed eosinophilic inflammation. Unlike respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus, rhinovirus is unique in that infection in those with asthma results in increased FENO levels 31-33 by way of increased inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in airway epithelial cells. 34 Indeed, when children with viral-associated exacerbations caused by rhinovirus were excluded from those with other respiratory viruses, FENO levels were not elevated.",

First, from a methodological standpoint, it would have been preferable to perform FENO measurements before spirometry because spirometry can result in a transient reduction in FENO levels. Past studies have shown the reduction to be modest (2 ppb or <10%) 35 and unlikely to have significantly altered our results. Second, we did not inquire as to whether our patients had recently ingested foods containing high levels of nitrates, or whether they were exposed to household cigarette smoke or were currently smoking cigarettes. Ingestion of foods containing high levels of nitrates can cause the FENO level to be elevated for up to 15 hours, 36 while current cigarette smoking can reduce the FENO levels by 60%. 37 In addition, we reported the FEV 1 /FVC ratio as a percentage, as opposed to the FEV 1 /FVC percent predicted. Because the ratio varies with age and sex, using percentage only misses this information and can give a false sense of abnormalities. Another limitation is that we were unable to identify the triggering agent(s) involved in the acute exacerbation in the PCR (\u00c0) group. It is possible that these subjects were reacting to inhaled seasonal allergens or newly acquired perennial allergens such as cat or dog dander. Alternatively, some of our patients may have had a falsely negative PCR result. Last, although we speculate that PCR (\u00c0) exacerbations were likely eosinophil driven, we did not perform sputum induction or collect peripheral blood to assess for eosinophilia.",

This is of potential importance because therapy may be altered on the basis of the underlying inflammatory process. By providing optimal therapy at the time of an exacerbation, attenuation of airway remodeling and loss of lung function as a result of the exacerbation may be achieved.",
