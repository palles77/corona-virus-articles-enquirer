Examination of infected suckling mouse brain and infected NCTC-1469 (mouse liver) cell cultures, by electron microscopy, revealed virus particles and inclusion bodies characteristic of a coronavirus. Neutralization, complement fixation and fluorescent antibody tests showed that the virus was related to mouse hepatitis virus. The virus was not isolated from 445 control, uninfected mice. Neutralising antibodies were not detected in 39 sera from diseased shearwaters and 2 sera from apparently healthy birds. Two shearwaters inoculated with the virus did not develop clinical signs of infection. The question of whether the virus was isolated from shearwaters or from laboratory mice is discussed. 1 Arch.

The disease affects shearwaters breeding on two islands, Skomer and Skokholm, off the south-west coast of Wales. The most common clinical sign of puffinosis is blisters on the webs of the feet (5, 6, 11) , although conjunctivitis and locking of the ankle joint of the legs (described as \"extensor spasm\" [5] ) have also been observed (8) . MIL~S and STOKER (1948) isolated an infectious agent from blood and blister fluid of shearwaters suffering from puffinosis. The agent produced characteristic histological changes in the chorio-allantoic membrane of fertile hens' eggs, and blisters in ducklings and pigeons; filtration studies indicated that it was of the size order of a virus.",

We are studying puffinosis because, unlike many epizootics in wild animal populations, Isolation Procedure During 1978, 19 shearwaters showing clinical signs of puffinosis were transported live to Oxford wbcre they were decapitated and the blood, organs, and webs of each bird collected. The birds were coded as SH78-1 to SH78-19. Explant cultures were established from the organs by placing 1 mm~ t, issue samples in 25 cm2 flasks, allowing them to stick to the flasks by leaving them at room temperature for 1 hour, then gently filling each flask with 5 ml Eagle's MEM supplemented with 20 per cent FCS. The flasks were incubated at 37 \u00b0 C and the medium changed weekly. Some of these cultures were subsequently subcultured successfully several times.

All of 43 mice inoculated intraeerebrally with approximately 3.0 log10 LDs0 of either SIt78-2 lung or SI-I78-8 blood showed evidence of infection whereas only 3 of 31 (10 per cent,) mice inoculated subcutaneously with the same inoeula showed clinical signs. Virus was not isolated from either the liver, spleen, heart or leg muscle of seven infected mice. However, the lungs of 2 out of 4 infected mice produced clinical signs when inoeulated intracerebrally into 2 day-old mice, but virus was not isolated from the lungs of these mice. Five 3 week-old mice were inoculated intracerebrally with the sixth SMB-passage of SH 78-2 lung but clinical signs of infection were not observed. Furthermore, evidence of infection was not observed in 2 day-old mice inoculated with the brains of these weanling mice (harvested 23 days after inoculation).",

STOKER and MILES (1953) were also unable to reproduce the disease in shearwaters but were able to demonstrate neutral-ization and complement fixation with sera from 2 shearwaters that had recovered from the disease. Our inability to detect antibodies in shearwater sera may have been due to the fact that the sera, were eolleeted from healthy and acutely-infected birds; eonva.teseent sera were not availa.ble.",

However, the evidence is not conclusive owing to the frequency of infections of mouse colonies with MHV and the difficulties of detecting such infections. Comparative studies with MHV have not been carried out because we do not wish, knowingly, to introduce MHV to our mouse colony. We hope to conclude our studies on the isolated eoronavirus by either increasing the number of isolations of this virus from shearwaters, or by proving that puffinosis is caused by some other infectious agent.",
