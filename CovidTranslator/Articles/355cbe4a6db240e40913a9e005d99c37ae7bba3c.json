However, a comparison of the difference in the HTS results based on the choice of reducing agent used and potency comparisons of selected inhibitors has not been done with the physiological reducing agent reduced glutathione (GSH). Here, we compared the effects of three reducing agents-dithiothreitol (DTT), b-mercaptoethanol (b-MCE), and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)-as well as GSH against three drug target proteins. Approximately 100,000 compounds were computationally screened for each target protein, and experimental testing of high-scoring compounds ($560 compounds) with the four reducing agents surprisingly produced many nonoverlapping hits. More importantly, we found that various reducing agents altered inhibitor potency (IC 50 ) from approximately 10 lM with one reducing agent to complete loss (IC 50 > 200 lM) of inhibitory activity with another reducing agent. Therefore, the choice of reducing agent in an HTS is critical because this may lead to the pursuit of falsely identified active compounds or failure to identify the true active compounds. We demonstrate the feasibility of using GSH for in vitro HTS assays with these three target enzymes.",

            "text": "High-throughput screening (HTS) 1 of large compound libraries has become widely used for the identification of drug leads. Performing HTS is both expensive and time-consuming, and hence strict quality control is essential. To eliminate compounds causing protein aggregation that are generally false positive hits, detergents (Triton, Tween, and Chaps) are added to assay buffers [1] . A carrier protein such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) is also added to decrease enzyme loss on the pipette or other surfaces as well as to stabilize the target enzyme in the reaction. The addition of a reducing agent to the assay is very important to prevent the oxidation of cysteines in the target proteins [2, 3] and to avoid selecting compounds that covalently interact with cysteines. There are three reducing agents commonly used for HTS assays: dithiothreitol (DTT), b-mercaptoethanol (b-MCE), and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). Studies have shown that strong reducing agents such as DTT and TCEP can generate H 2 O 2 by a chain reaction of oxidation-reduction (redox) cycling in the presence of redox cycling compounds (RCCs), which can lead to false positives [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . This is not the case for weaker reducing agents such as reduced glutathione (GSH), b-MCE, and cysteine [6, 11] . Extensive studies have been done to reduce false positives in the presence of strong reducing agents. However, very few studies have been performed to investigate the reduction of false negatives by reducing agent selection [12] , and no study has been done yet to compare the difference on the outcome of HTS and potencies (IC 50 values) of selected compounds with various reducing agents as compared with the physiological reducing agent GSH. Therefore, we have examined the effect of the reducing agents DTT, b-MCE, TCEP, as well as the physiological reducing agent GSH, against three drug target proteins: human SARS-CoV 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), and NS3 from hepatitis C virus (HCV).",

The active site pocket of 3CLpro is open, whereas that of PLpro is relatively constricted, causing them to have different characteristics. In addition to being a diverse system to test the effects of reducing agents on compound screening assays, these proteases are attractive targets for new antiviral drug design due to their crucial roles in the viral replication process [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . HCV is a major cause of chronic liver disease, affecting more than 170 million people ($3% of the world population) [20] .

In this work, our goal was to ensure the quality of our screening campaigns by testing the effect of the different reducing agents on our assay results. To avoid both false positives and false negatives, enzyme assays were performed for all three proteases against approximately 560 computationally prescreened compounds (out of a library of 100,000 compounds that were virtually screened for each target). We performed five parallel assays: one for each of the four reducing agents and one with no reducing agent. Here we present the effects of the reducing agents on the primary screening results and the potencies of screened inhibitors.",

In addition, it may be good to test the inhibitory activity of hit compounds against GSSG, which is predominant in serum, because compounds will likely pass through human serum before reaching the intracellular environment. Based on this definition of true positives, we found that TCEP produced the largest number of false positives in the case of NS3/ 4A.

In the case of PLpro hits, the Hill slopes of 3 compounds (compounds 25-27) increased with GSH and TCEP, but those of the other 3 compounds (compounds 28-30) were still near 1 with both GSH and b-MCE. Although a few compounds (3 of 20 negatives with DTT) may have produced aggregation-based inhibition, the majority of hit compounds that showed dramatic shifts in IC 50 values did not produce the aggregation-based inhibition. According to this analysis, DTT does not generally appear to prevent aggregation-based nonspecific inhibition for the majority of the negatives.",

IC 50 value comparisons revealed that reducing agents significantly affect inhibitory activities of screened compounds, and this leads to an important question: which IC 50 values should we consider to be a true indicator of potency for inhibitors? We suggest that IC 50 values with GSH should be considered to be the best indicator of in vivo efficacy, at least for intracellular enzyme targets, because GSH is the physiological reducing agent in the human body. However, GSH has not been used as a reducing agent in HTS assays due to concerns of potential oxidation under assay conditions. GSH is known to undergo oxidation in aqueous buffer conditions, forming the disulfide bonded GSSG. We carried out a detailed study on the stability of GSH by monitoring both GSH and GSSG amounts and found that only 10% of GSH was oxidized to GSSG over a 6-h time period at room temperature. The presence of NS3/4A in the assay buffer did not affect the stability of GSH (Fig. 3A) , whereas GSH was slightly stabilized by the two cysteine proteases, 3CLpro and PLpro, as compared with GSH alone (Fig. 3B and 3C) . Thus, it is feasible to use GSH as a reducing agent in an HTS assay for up to a 6-h time period provided that fresh GSH is added to the assay buffer every 6 h.",

Although the former can be eliminated in secondary or tertiary assays with some time and effort, false negatives from the initial HTS assays can derail the efforts of drug discovery through the loss of potentially novel inhibitors. Our results suggest that each reducing agent could have different effects on substrate affinity and enzyme activity in the case of both cysteine and serine proteases. The enzyme efficiency of NS3/4A and PLpro was affected by the type of reducing agent, whereas 3CLpro efficiency was not affected. Both 3CLpro and PLpro contain cysteine residues in their active sites, but the reducing agents had very different effects on their kinetic parameters. The types of reducing agents affected the three proteases in different ways. This observation was not in keeping with the presumed role of the reducing agents as antioxidants. It has been suggested that reducing agents may have some additional functions other than working as simple antioxidants [12, [26] [27] [28] . A recent study showed that DTT weakened the monomer interac- Note: Compounds with more than 35% inhibition at a 50 lM concentration were considered to be positive hit compounds for each reducing agent, and positives with GSH were considered to be true positive hits.

Although it remains to be determined exactly how reducing agents affect apparent activity, it is important to note that the outcome of any HTS assay can be seriously affected by the choice of reducing agent. In addition, as they pursue lead compounds, researchers rely on the IC 50 value of an inhibitor as an indicator of compound potency. It also would be problematic if different reducing agents could alter the potency of screened compounds. We discovered that the potency of the same inhibitor was altered from approximately 10 lM with one reducing agent to the complete loss of inhibitory activity (IC 50 > 200 lM) with another. This is a very significant difference, and hence the choice of a proper reducing agent is critical because this may lead to the pursuit of poor lead compounds (false positives) or to missing good potential lead candidates (false negatives).",
