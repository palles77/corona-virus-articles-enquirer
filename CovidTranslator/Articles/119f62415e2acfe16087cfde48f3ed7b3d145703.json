            "text": "Although diarrhoea and malaria are among the leading causes of child mortality and morbidity in Sub-Saharan Africa, few detailed studies have examined the patterns and determinants of these ailments in the most affected communities. In this paper, we investigate the spatial distribution of observed diarrhoea and fever prevalence in Malawi using individual data for 10,185 children from the 2000 Malawi Demographic and Health survey. We highlight inequalities in child health by mapping the residual district spatial effects using a geo-additive probit model that simultaneously controls for spatial dependence in the data and potential nonlinear effects of covariates. The residual spatial effects were modelled via a Bayesian approach. For both ailments, we were able to identify a distinct district pattern of childhood morbidity. In particular, the results suggest that children living in the capital city are less affected by fever, although this is not true for diarrhoea, where some urban agglomerations are associated with a higher childhood morbidity risk. The spatial patterns emphasize the role of remoteness as well as climatic, environmental, and geographic factors on morbidity. The fixed effects show that for diarrhoea, the risk of child morbidity appears to be lower among infants who are exclusively breastfed than among those who are mixed-fed. However, exclusive breastfeeding was not found to have a protective effect on fever. An important socio-economic factor for both diarrhoea and fever morbidity was parental education, especially maternal educational attainment. Diarrhoea and fever were both observed to show an interesting association with child's age. We were able to discern the continuous worsening of the child morbidity up to 8-12 months of age. This deterioration set in right after birth and continues, more or less linearly until 8-12 months, before beginning to decline thereafter. Independent of other factors, a separate spatial process produces district inequalities in child's health. r (N.-B Kandala), m.a.magadi@lboro.ac.uk (M.A. Magadi), nmadise@aphrc.org (N.J. Madise).",

Until recently, available information on childhood morbidity was derived from clinics and hospital records. However, information obtained from hospitals represents only a small proportion of all cases, since many other cases do not seek medical attention (Black, 1984) . Thus, the hospital records may not be appropriate for estimating the prevalence of diarrhoea for program developments (Woldermicael, 2001) .",

            "text": "Policy-makers and researchers often want to know the distribution of a disease prevalence by geographical region, or association with environmental factors (Diggle, Moyeed, & Thomson, 2002; Thomson, Connor, Milligan, & Flasse, 1996) . In this regard, mapping risk variations in child morbidity is an invaluable tool. Further, the mapping of variation in risk of childhood morbidity can help improve the targeting of scarce resources for public health interventions. Therefore, Geographic Information System (GIS) is a powerful tool for public health practitioners that can easily allow them to assess patterns, trends and relationships between health events and environmental, socio-economic and other geographic factors (see for instance the case of disease surveillance, preparedness and response coordination to combat health threats such as West Nile virus, anthrax, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bioterrorism (Gardner & Harrington, 2003) ). GIS further helps us to understand childhood disease prevalence at the community level (see for instance Garg, Omwomo, Witte, Lee, & Deming, 2001; Mbonye, 2003 Mbonye, , 2004 ) and helps to identify underserved populations, and can help public health agencies to efficiently allocate scarce program resources to appropriate locations. For example, the Communicable Disease Control Division of the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) uses GIS to help identify at-risk populations and determine where to focus efforts to vaccinate residents against influenza. This paper is based on a study of the spatial distribution of childhood diarrhoea and fever in Malawi. The study applied Bayesian statistical and geo-statistical techniques to the 2000 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data of Malawi with location (district) attributes and other information to answer specific questions about geographic inequalities in childhood disease prevalence. The DHS in Malawi conducted in 2000 is a valuable resource for population-based morbidity data, although we recognize its limitation, like other DHSs elsewhere, in that it relates only to reported child morbidity during the last 2 weeks before the survey. Thus, our results might be influenced by the effects of seasonality in diseases prevalence.",

With a gross national product (GNP) of US$ 170/person/year, Malawi is among the 20 least economically developed countries in the world (National Statistical Office [Malawi] and ORC Macro, 2001; WHO, 1998) . Agriculture accounts for over a third of the GNP, about 90 percent of export earnings and approximately three-quarters of total employment (UNICEF and Government of Malawi, 1993) . Despite economic difficulties Malawi has invested a lot in health. According to UNICEF statistics there is a reasonably good network of health facilities in Malawi (the median distance from home to the nearest facility is 5 km). For 90 percent of births, mothers have received at least one antenatal care from a trained health worker, and 86 percent of children aged 12-23 months possess a health card indicating a high under-five clinic attendance and about 90 percent of children are reported to have been vaccinated against the most common illnesses. However, improvements in health indicators have been smaller than expected. Currently, the maternal mortality rate is estimated at 1120-1180/100,000 live births. Life expectancy at birth is only 44 years, largely because of high mortality amongst the children. For every 1000 live births, about 135 die before the age of 1 year and 200 before the age of 5 years (National Statistical Office [Malawi] and ORC Macro (2001) . Findings of the 2000 MDHS point to important changes in Malawi's health and demographic profile. Mortality of children under age 5 has declined since the early 1990s. During the period 1988-1992, the under-five mortality rate was 234 deaths/1000 live births, compared with 189/1000 between 1996 -2000 and ORC Macro (2001) . Although this represents important progress, the rate of the downward trend is modest and childhood mortality remains at a very high level. A comparison of the 1992 and 2000 Malawi DHS shows that the prevalence of diarrhea decreased slightly from 20% to 17% between the two periods. However, the percentage of ill children who received treatment reduced. All these point to the fact that Malawian children are growing up in an environment of high morbidity, low utilization of health care, and consequently high mortality risks.",

Measures of socio-economic status that are thought to be associated with infant heath include: maternal and paternal education; household wealth; household size; parental occupation; and rural or urban residence. Kandala and Madise (2004) , who used the 1992 DHS data from Malawi and Zambia, in their study of childhood morbidity, found that the level of maternal education was highly significant in the two countries. They also found that childhood morbidity was lower among educated women, and that although this effect attenuated with the inclusion of other socio-economic factors in the models, maternal education remained significant.",

The impact of the household's size should, however, not be over-interpreted, since to some extent it directly mirrors infant mortality. For instance, a household with high mortality risk will remain small. In contrast, a household's size might also reflect its wealth, as a rich household will attract occupants. Again, in a large household, a child might benefit from the help of several adults. Large households may benefit from scale economies in time for childcare as well as in expenditures. Alternatively, they may have become better at raising children through accumulated experience (Christianensen & Alderman, 2001) .",

In this paper, we take advantage of advances in GISs and how the technology provides opportunities to study associations between environmental exposure and the spatial distribution of diseases. Jacquez (2000) discusses how GIS can be used to monitor disease outcomes, identify health risks, and design and implement intervention plans. The epidemiological approach has not yielded all the answers, but it holds great merit and much potential to further contribute to the knowledge of disease etiology. This study enhances our understanding of diarrhoea and fever prevalence in a dimension that could not have been possible prior to the availability of GIS. The results will help us making further decisions in planning for diarrhoea and fever research.",

The DHS data have been collected hierarchically at the family and community levels which are inter-related. Standard analysis of the fixed effects covariates for child morbidity neglects this correlation structure and dependence in the data. This neglect leads to underestimation of standard errors of the fixed effects that inflates the apparent significance of the estimates (Bolstad & Manda, 2001) . Our analysis includes this correlation structure and account for the dependence of community in the model. The model also permitted borrowing strength from neighbouring areas to obtain estimates for areas that may, on their own, have inadequate sample sizes.

In this way, we are able to identify district patterns of prevalence of diarrhoea and fever that are either related to socio-economic variables that are not in the model and that have a clear spatial pattern, or point to spatial (possibly epidemiological or environmental) processes that account for these spatial patterns.

The hypothesis that regional classifications conceal district variations was investigated for both levels separately using Geo-additive probit models. Prevalence of disease for each household were related to the distance of the household from the nearest next district and region. The region variables were categorized into dummies. There was a clear spatial pattern as observed in the distribution of diarrhoea and fever prevalence at the district level (Table 1) . For example, the aggregate regional levels of diarrhoea (Table 1 or left panel of Fig. 1 ) in the central and northern regions of Malawi mask large district variability. The geographical information given in Table 1 (or right panel of Fig. 1) is highly aggregated and conceals local and district specific effects. On the other hand, diarrhoea prevalence by districts in Table 1 (or Fig. 2 ) strongly depended on the sample size and may be rather unstable. Smoothing techniques were used to stabilize the observed prevalence in the sample as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 .",

The central districts are at a lower altitude than other parts of the country. It is likely that climatic factors and associated diseases are responsible for this pronounced district pattern. Food insecurity associated with drought and flooding in the shire valley, which is a result of hazardous effect of climatic variation are among possible explanations for these negative effects. Furthermore, the central districts are among the high-density population areas and this environment tends to increase the child's exposure to disease. For fever, it appears that children living in northern and central-west districts are at lower risk compared with children living in the central-east and south. In general, children living in provincial capitals are at significantly lower risk compared with children in the rural areas. The negative spatial effects on child morbidity in southern districts correspond to districts that are among densely populated areas in the province; therefore, their share of disease spread may be one of the major factors of this negative impact on child morbidity.",

            "text": "In Malawi, childhood diarrhoea and fever are associated with child's age and mother's age at birth of the child. Figs. 4 and 7 show the effect of child's age on diarrhoea and fever in Malawi and Figs. 5 and 8 show the effect of mother's age on the two ailments. Shown are the posterior means together with 95% CIs. For comparison a regression line obtained by a linear fit is added to the plot. While the effect of the variable ''mother's age'' is almost linear for both ailments, its effects on the variable ''child's age'' are clearly nonlinear. The linear model assumes a negative relationship between mother's age at child's birth and risk of diarrhoea or fever, and between child's age and risk of diarrhoea and fever. As we show in Figs this glosses over important nonlinearity in the effects. The data suggest deterioration in child diarrhoea that sets in right after birth and continues, more or less linearly, until 12 months of age. This immediate deterioration in child morbidity was not expected, as the literature commonly associates such deterioration with weaning at around 4-6 months. In a Kenyan study, children aged 1-2 years were the most vulnerable (Magadi, 1997) . One reason for this unexpected finding could be that, according to the DHS surveys, most parents gave their children liquids other than breast milk shortly after birth, a factor which might contribute to infections. This is due to the influence of poor-quality nutrition that is replacing breast milk as well as the onset of infectious diseases. These diseases are often related to unclean water and food which is replacing the breast milk, and the child no longer benefits from the mother's antibodies that are transmitted through the breast milk (Stephenson, 1999) . Initially, the worsening health status shows up as acute under-nutrition. But then childhood morbidity develops and worsens until about age 1. At that time, the body has developed its immune system to fight the impact of infectious diseases more effectively (Moradi & Klasen, 2000; WHO, 1995) . The influence of mother's age on child diarrhoea and fever show a general tendency for child morbidity to decline with increasing maternal age. Part of the explanation for the observed association of morbidity risk and younger mother's age may be attributed to the tendency for young mothers to be socially and economically disadvantaged (World Bank, 2000) , and the fact that younger mothers do not often use health services as much as older mothers (Magadi, Madise, & Rodrigues, 2000) . These results are indicative of general trends and may be of use to planners for targeting policy. Tables 2 and 3) After we controlled for the spatial dependence in the data, the fixed effects show the importance of parental education, breastfeeding, ethnicity, size of child, and rural-urban residence on child morbidity. The findings are generally as expected and consistent with the literature. Children of highly educated mothers or living in urban areas are at lower risk of fever than other children (Cleland & Sathar, 1984; Curtis & Steele, 1996; Hobcraft, McDonald, & Rutsein, 1985; Kandala, 2002; Madise, Banda, & Benaya, 2003) . The higher rural fever risk is possibly due to the fact that rural areas in Sub-Saharan African are under-developed and have less public service per capita compared with urban areas (Brockerhoff, 1993; Kuate Defo, 1996) . As a result, living in rural areas provides no access to beds with mosquito nets or better health care and increases the risk of malaria and fever. After we controlled for child, household, and districts characteristics the residential location (rural versus urban) does not affect child diarrhoea. The urban-rural effect may be captured by the district effects. Furthermore, the lack of corresponding urban advantage with respect to diarrhoea may be partly attributed to growing urban poverty in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, which has been associated with poor sanitation in the densely populated slum settlements leading to increased incidence of diarrhoea among children of the urban poor (Magadi, 2003) .",

The interpretation of fever in this report should take into account the fact that the DHS surveys are (for logistical reasons) mostly conducted in the dry, least malarious season (Africa Malaria Report, WHO, 2003) . In addition, the observed prevalence of diarrhoea can be considered as incidence rate of diarrhea. Because of the short followup period of 2 weeks before the interview, we have ignored the role of competing risk, although diarrhoea may be present in different forms: persistent diarrhoea (more than 14 days), acute watery diarrhoea, or dysentery (blood in stool). Other diseases that can occur concurrently with diarrhoea include measles and malaria. Malnutrition also often accompanies diarrhoea.",

It is possible that health care utilization is a reflection of accessibility of health care services and has been captured by the spatial effects in the multivariate analysis. Also vaccination status turns out to be statistically insignificant, although other studies in rural sub-Saharan Africa have reported immunization status of a child as an important factor associated with diarrhoea (see for instance Mbonye, 2003 Mbonye, , 2004 . It should be noted that in the DHS, the reliability of parental recall of vaccination status for vaccines given to infants has not been studied and it is therefore unknown and may affect these results.",

Thus, most of the rural households will be in the lowest wealth category even if they have other indicators of wealth (e.g. livestock or farm machinery). The consequence of this misclassification would be to lower the risk of childhood diseases of rural households. Another limitation with household wealth indices derived from DHS is that they are based on current status data so that they might not capture the true level of household wealth during the infancy of children born several years before the survey. However, since these analyses are restricted to births within 5 years of the survey, this bias will not be substantial.",

This will enable us to draw a picture of where and whether events are concentrated, which will help in turn to guide local public health response or investigation to help identify at-risk populations and determine where to focus efforts to vaccinate residents against malaria. Moreover, the measure of disease prevalence used here, recall of whether a child had been ill with diarrhoea or fever in the past 2 weeks is less perfect as it is quite subjective, based on a short-term recall. Future work needs to address the question of disease environment more closely.",

For instance, the age effect suggests the need to pay attention to child feeding practices, particularly during the first 6 months after birth. Second, the nonlinear influence of mother's age indicates that childcare promotion messages should be targeted particularly to younger parents. Of high significance are the district influences on child morbidity. In particular, they suggest that in Malawi, some urban agglomerations are associated with higher risk of diarrhoea. Also, more emphasis must be placed upon the role of remoteness as well as climatic and geographic factors on childhood morbidity. It would be of value to investigate district-level factors not included in our models, such as environmental, socio-economic, cultural and human behavioural factors involved in the etiology of the disease. The North-Central divide in Malawi highlights the importance of such considerations. ",
