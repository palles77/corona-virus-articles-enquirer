Methods: In all, 3104 adults with LRTI were enrolled, of whom 141 (4.5%) had community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and 2985 matched controls in a prospective study in 16 primary care networks in Europe, and followed patients up at 28e35 days. We detected Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae and assessed susceptibility, atypical bacteria and viruses. Results: A potential pathogen was detected in 1844 (59%) (in 350 (11%) bacterial pathogens only, in 1190 (38%) viral pathogens only, and in 304 (10%) both bacterial and viral pathogens). The most common bacterial pathogens isolated were S. pneumoniae (5.5% overall, 9.2% in CAP patients) and H. influenzae (5.4% overall, 14.2% in CAP patients). Less than 1% of S. pneumoniae were highly resistant to penicillin and 12.6% of H. influenzae were b-lactamase positive. The most common viral pathogens detected were human rhinovirus (20.1%), influenza viruses (9.9%), and human coronavirus (7.4%). Influenza virus, human parainfluenza viruses and human respiratory syncytial virus as well as human rhinovirus, human coronavirus and human metapneumovirus were detected significantly more frequently in LRTI patients than in controls. Conclusions: A bacterial pathogen is identified in approximately one in five adult patients with LRTI in primary care, and a viral pathogen in just under half, with mixed infections in one in ten. Penicillinresistant pneumococci and b-lactamase-producing H. influenzae are uncommon. These new findings support a restrictive approach to antibiotic prescribing for LRTI and the use of first-line, narrow-spectrum agents in primary care. M. Ieven, Clin Microbiol Infect 2018;24:1158 ",

            "text": "Community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is one of the commonest reasons for consulting in primary care and accounts for considerable antibiotic use and health-care costs. It is neither feasible nor cost-efficient to identify microbial aetiology in most patients who present with LRTI in primary care because of sampling challenges, limited access diagnostics and the limited clinical utility of receiving a result after empirical treatment decision has been made [1] . Consequently, little is known about the aetiology of LRTI in everyday primary care. In addition, detecting pathogens in both symptomatic patients and contemporaneous controls to distinguish between asymptomatic carriage and the presence of agents causing symptoms has rarely been carried out. Nevertheless, despite limited knowledge of the proportion of patients that have an identifiable bacterial aetiology and the sensitivities of these pathogens, and evidence of limited or no clinical benefit from antibiotic treatment, more than half of patients presenting to primary care with LRTI/acute cough in Europe are prescribed antibiotics [2e4] . This contributes to the selection of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria [5] . Improved knowledge of likely pathogens (at the point of care) and the likely susceptibility of bacterial pathogens, could help to guide antibiotic prescribing decisions and so help contain unnecessary antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore, such information could support public health policy on prevention of respiratory illness, including vaccination.",

HCoV have recently been identified in small numbers of adults with severe pneumonia [10, 21] , but is not routinely tested for in adult outpatients with CAP or LRTI. We may have underestimated the prevalence of HCoV as HKU-1 testing was not performed and HKU-1 is generally as prevalent as NL63 and OC43 [22] . Infections due to HMPV are mainly described in long-term care facilities [10] . We found HMPV more prevalent in outpatients with CAP compared with those with other LRTIs, with even greater prevalence in CAP patients than respiratory syncytial virus, and similar to the 3%e7% HMPV infection prevalence found in hospitalized adults [23] . Although numbers are small, human adenovirus was significantly more prevalent in CAP compared with other LRTI, a unique finding in immunocompetent outpatients. The high rates of viral detection in outpatients with LRTI and CAP suggests that comprehensive microbiological assessment is important to guide management and may explain the limited average benefit from antibiotic treatment in the placebo-controlled study that we conducted in a large subset of patients included in the present analysis [2] .",
