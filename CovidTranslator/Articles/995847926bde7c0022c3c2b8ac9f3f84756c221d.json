More than 16% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the fatality ratio was about 1%-2%. No specific treatment has been reported. Herein, we examine the effects of Favipiravir (FPV) versus Lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV) for the treatment of COVID-19. Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who received oral FPV (Day 1: 1600 mg twice daily; Days 2-14: 600 mg twice daily) plus interferon (IFN)-a by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the FPV arm of this study, whereas patients who were treated with LPV/RTV (Days 1-14: 400 mg/100 mg twice daily) plus IFN-a by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the control arm. Changes in chest computed tomography (CT), viral clearance, and drug safety were compared between the two groups. For the 35 patients enrolled in the FPV arm and the 45 patients in the control arm, all baseline characteristics were comparable between the two arms. A shorter viral clearance time was found for the FPV arm versus the control arm (median (interquartile range, IQR), 4 (2.5-9) d versus 11 (8-13) d, P < 0.001). The FPV arm also showed significant improvement in chest imaging compared with the control arm, with an improvement rate of 91.43% versus 62.22% (P = 0.004). After adjustment for potential confounders, the FPV arm also showed a significantly higher improvement rate in chest imaging. Multivariable Cox regression showed that FPV was independently associated with faster viral clearance. In addition, fewer adverse reactions were found in the FPV arm than in the control arm. In this open-label nonrandomized control study, FPV showed significantly better treatment effects on COVID-19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance; if causal, these results should be important information for establishing standard treatment guidelines to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia [1] [2] [3] [4] . As of 25 February 2020, at least 77 785 cases and 2666 deaths had been identified across China [5] and in other countries; in particular, 977 and 861 cases were identified in South Korea and Japan, respectively. The outbreak has already caused global alarm. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization It has been revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has a genome sequence that is 75%-80% identical to that of SARS-CoV, and has more similarities to several bat coronaviruses [6] . SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh reported human-infecting member of the family Coronaviridae, which also includes SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. It has been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19. Both the clinical and the epidemiological features of COVID-19 patients demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and high mortality. About 16%-21% of people with the virus in China have become severely ill, with a 2%-3% mortality rate [1, 4] . However, there is no specific treatment against the new virus. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to identify effective antiviral agents to combat the disease and explore the clinical effect of antiviral drugs.",

Several drugs, such as ribavirin, interferon (IFN), Favipiravir (FPV), and Lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV), have been used in patients with SARS or MERS, although the efficacy of some drugs remains controversial. It has recently been demonstrated that, as a prodrug, FPV (half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) = 61.88 lmol\u00c1L \u00c01 , half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) > 400-lmol\u00c1L \u00c01 , selectivity index (SI) > 6.46) effectively inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells (ATCC-1586) [7] . Furthermore, other reports show that FPV is effective in protecting mice against Ebola virus challenge, although its EC 50 value in Vero E6 cells was as high as 67 lmol\u00c1L \u00c01 [8] . Therefore, clinical studies are urgently needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this antiviral nucleoside for COVID-19 treatment.",

The CT findings were graded and scored using the method described previously [9, 10] by two medical diagnostic radiographers who were blind to grouping. The CT findings were graded on a three-point scale: 1 as normal attenuation, 2 as groundglass attenuation, and 3 as consolidation. Each lung zone-with a total of six lung zones in each patient-was assigned a score on the following scale, according to the distribution of the affected lung parenchyma, using a method modified from a previously described protocol [10] : 0 as normal, 1 as 25% abnormality, 2 as 25%-50% abnormality, 3 as 50%-75% abnormality, and 4 as 75% abnormality. The four-point scale of the lung parenchyma distribution was then multiplied by the radiologic scale described above. Points from all zones were added for a final total cumulative score, with a value ranging from 0 to 72 (Fig. 1) . A change of ''Improve\" in the chest CT was defined as the total cumulative score being lower than before medication; a change of ''Worse\" was defined as the total cumulative score being higher than before medication; and a change of ''Constant\" was defined as the total cumulative score being the same as before treatment (Fig. 1) .",

These findings suggest that FPV has significantly better treatment effects on COVID-19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance, as compared with LPV/RTV. FPV, which is known as a prodrug, is a novel RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor, which has been shown to be effective in the treatment of influenza and Ebola virus [8, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Recently, a report from Wang et al. [7] showed that both FPV and remdesivir are effective in reducing the SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro (EC 50 = 61.88 lmol\u00c1L \u00c01 , CC 50 > 400 lmol\u00c1L \u00c01 , SI > 6.46).

However, given the high number of patients presenting simultaneously and the very high infectivity of the disease, it was ethically unacceptable to allocate patients to receive a different experimental drug using a randomization process impossible for most of the patients to understand. Furthermore, in the context of rumors and distrust of hospital isolation, using a randomized design at the outset might have led even more patients to refuse being isolated. Therefore, we chose to conduct a nonrandomized trial, in which patients consecutively admitted to the hospital during two separate periods were included in two groups, respectively. Importantly, all baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable and the effectiveness of FPV remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders.",

This finding suggests that improvement of the disease may depend on inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2, and that FPV controls the disease progression of COVID-19 by inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2. Until recently, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 had not been well clarified. Since the infection of SARS-CoV-2 was thought to be self-limited and characterized by systemic inflammation reaction, symptomatic and supportive treatment was mainly recommended by the WHO and the National Health Commission of the PRC. This description is similar to MERS-CoV, for which nonspecific therapeutic interventions are often introduced to prevent severe mor- bidity and mortality [16] . How antivirals would contribute to control of the disease is controversial. Although there have been many registered clinical trials focusing on antiviral drugs for COVID-19, the timing, duration of treatment, and study endpoints have not been unified. In the current study, the time of viral clearance was introduced as a primary endpoint to evaluate the antiviral effect of FPV on the SARS-CoV-2 and successfully identify the priority of FPV. The relationship between the time of viral clearance and the improvement in CT image indicates that viral clearance is an ideal surrogate for the clinical endpoint. A limitation of the present study was that the relationship between the viral titer and the clinical prognosis was not well clarified. Future research could pay more attention to this point. More adverse events were observed in the control arm than in the experimental arm, and were similar to the adverse events observed in studies of AIDS treated by LPV/RTV. It is worth mentioning that the treatment duration of FPV in the present study was twice as long as that used for the treatment of influenza. However, the adverse events in the experimental arm were rare and tolerable, and none of the patients needed to discontinue FPV treatment. These results seem to suggest that the treatment duration of FPV can be prolonged if necessary.",

In this pilot study of a non-randomized control trial, we found that FPV showed significantly better treatment effects on COVID-19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance; if causal, these results should be important information for establishing standard treatment guidelines to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we introduced the time of viral clearance as a primary endpoint for experimental antiviral treatment and demonstrated it to be a surrogate of clinical endpoint; this will be helpful for designing COVID-19 research.",
