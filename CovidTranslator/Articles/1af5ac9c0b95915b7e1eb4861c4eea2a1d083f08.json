Global RSV disease burden is estimated at 64 million cases and 160,000 deaths every year (2) . Pneumococcal pneumonia results in more than 1 million deaths each year worldwide with approximately half a million in children younger than 5 years (3). There is increasing evidence that RSV and the pneumococcus interact to increase the severity of respiratory disease (4) (5) (6) . Seasonal increases in infections with RSV in young children are strongly associated with subsequent increased hospital admissions with invasive pneumococcal disease (7) (8) (9) . Studies in mice also show a significant increase in pneumococcal sepsis and decreased clearance of pneumococci from the lung of mice previously infected with RSV (10) .

The addition of pneumococci to RSV-infected cells led to significant (P , 0.05) increases in the apical secretion of IL-1b, IL-12p70, tumor necrosis factor-a, IL-5, IL-13, CCL11, CCL17, and CCL22 (Table 1 ) (compared with cells infected with RSV alone). The adherence of pneumococci after 1 hour to ciliated epithelial cells previously mock-infected or infected with RSV for 72 hours. (B) The mean (SEM) level of ciliated cells with dyskinetic cilia expressed as a percentage of the total motile ciliated cells after 1 hour. Data were collected from seven independent experiments. Cells were infected with RSV, mock infected followed by pneumococci, or infected with RSV followed by pneumococci. Control cells were treated with bovine serum albumin alone. (C and D) Relative quantification of pneumococcal adherence (C) or toxicity-associated gene expression (D) when exposed to naive (green bars) or RSV-infected (blue bars) human ciliated epithelial cells. The fold changes in gene expression were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and calculated using the 2 -\u0394\u0394CT method (27) . The internal control gene was gyrB and the reference condition was pneumococci exposed to naive respiratory epithelial cells obtained from the same donor. Data were analyzed using a parametric paired t test. A P value of less than 0.05 was statistically significant. Compared with cells exposed to pneumococci alone, coinfection led to significant increases (P , 0.05) in levels of tumor necrosis factor-a, IL-5, and CXCL8 ( Table 1 ). The increase in CXCL8 is of particular interest because this chemokine is responsible for the recruitment of neutrophils into the airways of patients infected with RSV. In our system, CXCL8 was ninefold higher following coinfection (median, 271 pg/ml; P , 0.05) compared with uninfected control epithelial cells (30 pg/ml). This compares with a threefold increase following pneumococcal infection alone (98 pg/ml; P . 0.05), and a fivefold increase following RSV infection alone (159 pg/ml; P . 0.05). This suggests that dual infection of respiratory epithelium may lead to a further increase in the number of inflammatory cells and increased lung cellular inflammation.",

We confirmed this interaction using antigen colocalization and confocal imaging, which showed that RSV G protein directly binds to the surface of the pneumococcus (indicated by the arrowed yellow regions in Figure 2C ). Western blotting analysis of a S. pneumoniae membrane lysate showed that RSV G protein bound to a single pneumococcal protein with a molecular weight of approximately 80 kD ( Figure 2D ).

However, pneumococci exposed to RSV G protein displayed significant differences in the transcriptome compared with pneumococci exposed to BSA. Figure 2F shows the number of genes that were affected in the transcriptome profiling experiment in response to RSV G protein treatment. The genes are grouped into Cluster of Orthologous Groups categories based on the putative functions of corresponding proteins (shown in Figure 2F ). In total, expression of 157 genes were altered of which 99 were up-regulated and 58 were down-regulated in response to RSV G protein treatment (see full list in Table E1 in the online supplement). Of particular note was the significant up-regulation of the pneumolysin (ply) gene because the toxin it encodes has been shown to be critical for the development of invasive pneumococcal disease (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) .

All mice reached the predefined endpoint and were culled by 12 hours (Figure 4A ). In contrast, all mice receiving the same dose of pneumococci ORIGINAL ARTICLE alone (exposed to BSA) survived the 7-day challenge without any signs of disease ( Figure 4B ). Comparison of the condition scores of mice challenged with RSV-exposed pneumococci showed that these mice fared significantly worse (P , 0.05) than the group infected with pneumococci alone ( Figure 4B ). Viable counts of bacteria in the lungs of mice challenged with RSV-exposed and control pneumococci after 6 hours showed the bacteria had replicated to similar levels (P . 0.05) ( Figure 4C ) suggesting that enhanced virulence was not a property of increased bacterial replication in the lungs. This surprisingly rapid development of disease implies an immune-mediated response. A previous study showed that mice receiving sequential infection by RSV then pneumococci had significantly greater inflammation and high levels of accumulated neutrophils compared with control mice and mice that were inoculated with each pathogen separately (10) . Mice infected with RSV (strain A2) alone did not develop any signs of illness over the 7-day study period ( Figure 4B ). This eliminated the possibility of a toxic effect from the RSV preparation.",

The data show that coinfection led to increased ciliary dyskinesia, which is known to impair mucociliary clearance in the airways of infected patients and may contribute to enhanced symptoms of disease (31) . There was also an increase in apical secretion of CXCL8, which is of particular interest because this chemokine is responsible for the recruitment of neutrophils into the airways of patients infected with RSV. The data suggest that the increase in cytokine release and epithelial cell ciliary dysfunction caused by RSV treatment is additive rather than synergistic with the response to pneumococcus alone. This would imply that the RSV induces changes in the pneumococcus in a dose-dependent fashion and that the level of RSV present may influence the disease outcome. This suggests that coinfection of respiratory epithelium by RSV and the pneumococcus may lead to a further increase in the number of inflammatory cells and increased lung cellular inflammation. S. pneumoniae is thought to initiate infection by adhering to epithelial cells that line the nasopharynx and pneumococci adhered to human ciliated epithelial cells in greater numbers and formed bacterial aggregates associated with the ciliary tips of RSV-infected ciliated cultures. The aggregates and bacteria appeared to move in time with the beating of the cilia suggesting they were attached to the cilia. The bacterial aggregates were not observed in control cultures. Increased pneumococcal adherence could result from increased expression of the enzyme neuraminidase in these bacteria. Neuraminidase is a major pneumococcal virulence factor involved in biofilm formation and adherence to host respiratory tract epithelial cells, possibly by clearing host cell surface structures (41) . Bacterial RNA recovered following exposure to RSV-infected cells showed higher levels of neuraminidase A (nanA) and neuraminidase B (nanB) gene expression compared with pneumococci exposed to control cultures. Alternatively, the increased pneumococcal adherence could be caused by the presence of RSV G protein on infected host cells. Previous studies suggest that RSV acts as a direct coupling particle between bacteria and epithelial cells (10, 30, 32, 34) and our previous work showed that RSV G protein is expressed on the ciliary tips (19) , consistent with RSV G protein acting as a bacterial receptor to increase bacterial adherence at this site.",

The RSV G protein directly binds pneumococcal PBP1a and binding RSV G protein led to significant changes to the pneumococcal transcriptome (in the absence of infected cells) including the up-regulation of genes encoding CiaR and CiaH, which together regulate virulence and competence in S. pneumoniae (42) . In addition the gene for pneumolysin (ply) was also up-regulated following exposure to RSV G protein, consistent with our previous qRT-PCR results showing that bacteria recovered from RSV-infected ciliated cell cultures displayed significant upregulation of ply. This is a major new finding because the toxin it encodes has been shown to be critical for the development of invasive pneumococcal disease (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) and blockade of pneumolysin represents a new target for antipneumococcal therapy (43) . Mutants deficient in pneumolysin are not lethal to mice (35, 38) and pretreatment of such a mutant with RSV did not result in increased virulence (see Figure E1 ).

Histopathologic examination of mice lungs following 6-hour pneumococcal challenge ( Figure 4C ) showed that lung pathology was absent in all groups of mice except the mice challenged with pneumococci exposed to RSV.

Is there is any variation in the response of the bacteria to G proteins from different clinical strains of RSV? The whole virus experiments reported here used a subgroup A virus, whereas a purified subgroup B G protein was used for the interaction assays. Both generated the enhancement of disease suggesting that the G proteins of both subgroups have the capacity to enhance pneumococcal disease. However, investigation of potential inherent variation in this interaction will permit us to uncover the key molecular motifs and identify high-risk serotypes and pathotypes and this is currently being investigated.",

The bound G protein was detected using a monoclonal antibody. The band excised for mass spectrometry identification is indicated by the red box. (E ) Peptide fragment alignment of MALDI-time of flight mass spectrometry of the excised band from the Western blot of S. pneumoniae RSV G protein-binding protein obtained after digestion with trypsin. The data show the identification of S. pneumoniae RSV G protein binding protein. The protein sequencing was performed as described in METHODS in the online supplement from two individual sequencings, which resulted in 29 peptide matches. Database searching showed that the peptides covered 43% of a 79.7-kD protein that showed a greater than 99% match probability to the S. pneumoniae PBP1A protein. Normal font, no highlight = not sequenced; bold font and yellow highlight = 100% sequence match to PBP1a; bold font and green highlight = random amino acid mismatch. (F) Summary of changes in the transcriptome of S. pneumoniae following incubation with RSV. The data indicate the number of genes in each category and the proportion showing increased (red) or decreased (green). ***Statistically significant change (P , 0.0001).",
