Since 1982 [4, 5] , the proliferation of the literature on the chemistry, biochemistry and (molecular) biology of sialic acids has accelerated dramatically, and several short reviews dealing with specific aspects of sialic acids have appeared [6-121. The aim of this chapter is to collate a mixture of, what is in our opinion, relevant information published before 1982 and new data appeared since then. Because of the profusion of biochemical and biological data published in the last few years, it was necessary to select those reports which, we believe, reflect potential trends in the future development of sialobiologyr",

            "text": "In Table 1 a survey of the 43 naturally occurring members of the sialic acid family [ 13-5 13 , together with their abbreviations and typical biological sources, is presented. The general name \"sialic acid\" is derived from the Greek \"sialos\", meaning saliva. Taking into account the Rules for Carbohydrate Nomenclature, as recommended by the IUPAC-IUBMB Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (1999, the mother-molecule neuraminic acid, which does not occur in free form in nature, due to its immediate cyclization to form an internal Schiff base, is systematically named 5-amino-3,5-dideoxy-~-gbcero-~galacto-non-2-ulosonic acid (Fig. 1 ) , and abbreviated as Neu, whereby the D-notation is implied in the trivial name. Chemically, this nine-carbon-containing monosaccharide is a 2-keto-carboxylic acid, a deoxysugar, and an aminosugar. The amino group is generally N-acetylated (5-acetam~do-3,5-d~deoxy-~-g~cero-~-galacto-non-2-ulopyranoson~c acid; fish glycoconjugates [511 a If possible, typical biological sources have been indicated. In the case of a sialic acid structure being proven by mass spectrometry andor NMR spectroscopy, reference numbers refer in general to such studies or to review articles including this sialic acid. N-acetylneuraminic acid; Neu5Ac) ( Fig. 1 ) or N-glycolylated (5-hydroxyacetamido-3,5-d~deoxy-~-glycero-~-galacto-non-2-ulopyranoson~c acid; N-glycolylneuraminic acid; Neu5Gc). As is evident from Table 1 , the hydroxyl groups may be free, esterified (acetylated, lactylated, sulfated, phosphorylated) or etherified (methylated). In the case where a sialic acid bears a hydroxy group instead of an amino group at C5, so-called deaminated neuraminic acid, it is systematically named 3 -deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid (Fig. l) , and is abbreviated as Kdn (2-keto-3-deoxynononic acid; also in this case the D-notation is part of the trivial name). Sialic acids are relatively strong acids, e.g. Neu5Ac has a pK, value found in the range of 2.2-3.0 in various studies with an average of 2.6. This strong acidity is responsible for processes such as autohydrolysis of sialic-acid-containing carbohydrate chains. Conformationally, sialic acids adopt the 2Cs chair conformation, having the glycerol side chain in an equatorial orientation [52] . Due to hydrogen bonding of HO7 and H08, leading to a trans-orientation of these groups, the glycerol side chain is not as flexible as one might expect. This has consequences for the course of the mild periodate oxidative degradation of this moiety in the case of substitution at C9 [53] . Free sialic acids have mainly the b-anomeric ring structure (>93%), whereas glycoconjugate-bound sialic acids occur specifically in the a-anomeric form [54] . In nucleotide-bound sialic acids, i.e. CMP-Neu5Ac (Fig. 2) , a P-configuration for the glycosidic bond is present [55] . Crystalline Neu5Ac occurs specifically in the 0-anomeric form [56] . With respect to 0-acetylation patterns in sialic acids, it is worthwhile to mention that spontaneous migration of 0-acetyl groups can occur between C7, C8 and C9. At pH values at which no significant de-0-acetylation is observed (e.g. physiological pH values), Neu5,7Ac2 can readily transform into Neu5,9Ac2, whereas Neu5,7,9Ac3 yields an equilibrium of Neu5,7,9Ac3 and Neu5,8,9Ac3 in a molar ratio of approximately 1:l; Neu4,5Ac2 does not give rise to 0-acetyl migrations [23] . Also starting from a-Neu5,8,9Ac3 4-aminophenylthio-glycoside a 1 : 1 equilibrium between the 8,9-and 7,9-di-O-acetylated derivatives is established [57] . 9-0-Acetylated N-acylneuraminic acids have been found in both glycoconjugates and oligolpolysaccharides of different biological origin ( Table 1) . The same is true for 7-0-acetylated N-acylneuraminic acids. It should be emphasized that Neu5,9Ac2 and other side-chain-0-acylated sialic acids occur in man[%] (see also sections 8.4.2 and 8.4.3), e.g. in human colon. Ungulates form the major source for 4-0-acetylated N-acylneuraminic acids [ 131, whereas minor sources are monotremes [19] , guinea pigs [21] and humans [59] . In an evaluation of the naturally occurring 0-acylation patterns, it is evident that 0-acyl groups are most frequently found at C9 of both NeuSAc and NeuSGc. 0-Methylated and 0-sulfated N-acylneuraminic acids have only been found in lower animals, e.g. in echinoderms [13, 31, 42] . 5-N-Acyl-2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-neuraminic acids like Neu2enSAc (S-acetamido-2,6anhydro-3,5-d~deoxy-~-g~cero-~-galacto-non-2-enon~c acid, Fig. 3 ) occur in free form in nature. Moreover, they can be generated from corresponding CMP-N-acylneuraminic acids in a non-enzymatic elimination reaction, occurring under physiological and, much faster, under alkaline conditions [34, 35] . Small amounts of Neu2enSAc are formed by a water elimination side reaction from NeuSAc during influenza-B-virus-sialidase-catalyzed desialylations of sialoglycoconjugates [60] .",

            "text": "Members of the sialic acid family occur mainly in bound form in higher animals, from the echinoderms onwards in evolution, but also in some viruses, various bacteria, protozoa, and pathogenic fungi [8, 13, 69] . Generally, they are constituents of glycoproteins [20, 21, 25, 40, [46] [47] [48] 5 1,70-I071 (Table 2) , glycolipids [13,3 1,44 ,108-1241 (Table 3) , and oligosaccharides [ 16, 19, 25, 76, (Table 4 ), usually occurring as terminal monosaccharide units, and of homo-and heteropolysaccharides [24, 26, 27, 49 ,156-I851 (Table 5 ). However, glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchors have also been shown to contain sialic acid [ 1861. Neu5Ac-and Neu5Gc-containing glycans frequently occur together, whereby ratio differences reflect species specificity, tissue specificity or physiological fluid specificity. Also Kdn has been found together with NeuSAc/SGc in specific glycoconjugates (Table 2 ). It should be noted that the presence of Neu5Gc in normal human tissue and soluble glycoproteins has not been established conclusively [ 13,187,1881. As is evident from Table 2 , NeuSAc/SGc-and Kdn-containing elements in Nand O-glycoprotein glycans do occur in many different microenvironments, however, with a restricted glycosidic linkage specificity. In general, N-acylneuraminic acids are a-2,3-or a-2,6-linked with D-galactose (Gal), a-2,3-or a-2,6-linked with N-acetyl-Dgalactosamine (GalNAc), a-2,6-linked with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), or a-2,8linked with other N-acylneuraminic acids. These types of glycosidic linkages have been firmly established by different analytical methods, including NMR spectroscopy [76, 77] . The sialic-acid-containing N-linked carbohydrate chains form part of the complex (Nacetyllactosamine and N,N'-diacetyllactosediamine subtypes; mono-, di-, tri-, tri'-, and tetraantennae) or the hybrid type of structures [ 1891. For the mucin-type 0-glycans, the N-acylneuraminic-acid-containing sequences are extensions of most of the wellestablished core types [ 1901. In addition, terminal NeuSAc(a24)Gal [75] , terminal NeuSAc(a24)GlcNAc [96] , and internal Fuc( 14)NeuSGc [97] sequences have been reported, and only one example of a terminal NeuSAc(a2-9)NeuSAc(a2-dimer has Table 2 Sialic-acid-containing elements in N-and 0-glycoproteins a Partial structure N 0 Ref(s).

Several of the sialic-acid-containing sequences present in Nand 0-glycoprotein glycans, also occur in glycolipids, milk and urinary oligosaccharides, and in (1ipo)polysaccharides of different biological origin. An impression of this overlap in structures can be obtained from an inspection of the structural data in Tables 3-5 , summarizing sialic-acid-containing elements of glycolipids, structures of milk and urinary sialo-oligosaccharides, and structures or elements of sialic-acid-containing (lipo)polysaccharides, respectively. It is interesting to note that for both glycoprotein and glycolipid glycans a sequence has been found comprising the oligomerization of Neu5Gc residues through their anomeric centers and N-glycolyl moieties, Neu5Gc(a2-05)Neu5Gc(a2-05)Neu5Gc(a2- [3 1,lO 11 ; in the case of the glycolipid material the NeuSGc residues are also 8-U-methylated [3 I] . In microbial polysaccharides, besides internal 8and 9-substituted NeuSAc residues, also internal 4-and 7-substituted Neu5Ac units have been frequently found (Table 5 ). It should be noted that some of the sialic-acid-containing glycan fragments and polysialic acids are specifically found in lipopolysaccharides and capsular polysaccharides of pathogenic bacteria, leading to severe problems in the development of suitable vaccines. A typical source for sialo-oligosaccharides generated from N-and O-linked glycans is the urine of sialidosis and I-cell disease patients [191-1991, though this is not discussed in detail here (see section 10.5, and volume 30 of the New Comprehensive Biochemistry series). Patients with other inborn errors of metabolism, like aspartylglycosaminuria [76, 152] or P-mannosidosis [ 1531 excrete small amounts of structurally unusual sialooligosaccharides, of which the formulae have been included in the footnotes of Table 4 .

In the case of a NeuSAc(a2-8)NeuSAc sequence, lactonization affords a NeuSAc(a2-8,1-9)Neu5Ac element (Fig. 4) , whereby the COOH group of one residue reacts with H 0 9 of an adjacent residue, to give a six-membered ring. Similarly NeuSAc(a2-9)NeuSAc can be converted into Neu5Ac(a2-9,1-8)NeuSAc, and NeuSAc(a2-3)Gal into Neu5Ac(a2-3,1-2)Gal or Neu5Ac(a2-3,1-4)Gal. In a polysialic acid chain of a-2,8-linked NeuSAc residues the a-2,8/ 1 ,9-lactonization can be effected under relatively mild conditions, like mild acid treatment [200] , yielding a water-insoluble polymer. The NeuSAc(a2-9,1-8)Neu5Ac formation in a polysialic acid chain can only be realized by carbodiimide treatment [20 11 , illustrating a more difficult condensation with the secondary H 0 8 group. The difference in reactivity between the primary and the secondary OH group has been nicely illustrated for the alternating a-2,8/a-2,9polysialic acid of E. coli K92 (Table 5 ) [202] . For gangliosides, it has been stated that ganglioside lactones occur also as such in nature [206] , and that in this way the negative charge of a ganglioside under physiological conditions can be modulated. Lactonization makes the oligosaccharide chain also more rigid, which may have important biological implications. Treatment with carbodiimide or glacial acetic acid can even convert a Neu5Ac(a2-8)NeuSAc(a2-3)Gal(~ 1-into a NeuSAc(a2-8,1-9)NeuSAc(a2-3,1-2)Gal(Pl-sequence [204, 205] .",

They differ from sialic acids in the presence of an additional amino function at C7, a deoxy function at C9, and in the configuration at the chiral centers: 5,7-diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-~-glycero-~-manno-non-2-ulosonic acid and 5,7-diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-~-g~cero-~-ga~acto-non-2-u~osonic acid [2 14,2 14al. So far, the two amino groups have been found to be substituted in different combinations, yielding acetamido, formamido, (R)-3-hydroxybutyramido, 4-hydroxybutyramido, or acetamidino functions. Also 0-acetylation can occur, whereas the (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl group at C7 can be used to link monosaccharides in a polysaccharide chain. Typical species are Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains [214] , Shigella boydii type 7 [214] , Vibrio salmonicida [214a] , Vibrio cholerae 0 2 [215] , Vibrio alginolyticus strain 945-80 [216] , Salmonella arizonae 0 6 1 [2 171, Yersinia ruckeri 0 1 [2 181, Legionella pneumophila strain 1 [219, 220] , and PseudomonasJluorescens ATCC 49271 [220a] .

            "text": "For the staining of sialic acids in tissues and cells, a great variety of techniques is available. Classical histochemistry of sialic-acid-containing glycoconjugates makes use of either binding of cationized dyes (e.g. Alcian blue, cationized ferritin, ruthenium red) or selective periodate oxidation (derivatization of generated aldehyde groups of sialic acids with e.g. p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, dansylhydrazine, rhodamine, biotidferritin-conjugated avidin). The second approach is strongly dependent on sidechain modifications [53] . Comprehensive reviews on this subject have appeared [6,22 11 . Nowadays, specific lectins are frequently used to detect the presence of glycosidically bound sialic acids in complex carbohydrates. However, the specificity of lectins is generally broad, and positive information has always to be checked in control experiments using e.g. sialidases in the presence and absence of inhibitors. For the histochemical analysis, lectins may be conjugated e.g. with gold particles, peroxidase, rhodamine or fluorescein isothiocyanate [6] . A large series of lectins which recognize sialic acid have been demonstrated to occur in nature, and most of their biological sources have been summarized in refs. [6, 11, 222] ; see also refs. [223-2271. For updated reviews focusing on lectins, see the present volume 29b of the New Comprehensive Biochemistry series. Generally, lectins have been isolated from lower animals such as prawns, snails, crabs, spiders, scorpions, lobsters, slugs, oysters, but also from plants, rat brain and B cells. While some of these lectins bind to both NeuSAc and NeuSGc, others are specific for NeuSAc. 0-Acetylation may also influence the binding strength of the lectin, both in a positive and in a negative manner (see section 10.3).",

The sialic-acid-binding properties of a number of viruses have been established, and it has been shown that influenza C virus, bovine corona virus and encephalomyelitis virus recognize 9-0-acetylated sialic acids (see also sections 8.4.2, 9.1 and 10.3). Microtiter-plate and nitrocellulose-membrane assays have been developed that use the hemagglutinin (receptor) and the receptor destroying activities (sialate 9-0acetylesterase) of the influenza C virus to specifically detect bound 9-0-acetylated sialic acids in glycoproteins [230,23 I] . Although the recognition site for Neu5,9Ac2 and the esterase activity are located on the same viral glycoprotein, these activities can be separated using different temperatures for the binding (4\u00b0C) and the enzyme reaction (4-methylumbelliferyl acetate or a-naphtyl acetate as substrates; 20-37\u00b0C). Other approaches are based on binding of the virus to immobilized ligands, and detection of the virus with monoclonal antibodies, whereby the esterase was selectively inactivated by the use of diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) [232] . Virus particles have also been labelled with radioactive isotopes [232] or biotin [233] . The application of the assay with virus particles for the staining of 0-acetylated sialic acids in tissue sections will be described in section 8.4.2. Recently, a new technique using a soluble chimera of the hemagglutininesterase portion of the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion-glycoprotein from influenza C virus and the Fc portion of human IgG, has been reported [234, 235] . Such a chimera retains both its recognition and enzymatic functions, and also has the binding properties of the Fc portion of IgG. The probing can be carried out on blots and TLC plates taking into account precautions for the recognition and esterase activities (this has to be inhibited by DFP in the test) as discussed above.",

Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. In the case of acid hydrolysis, problems arise with respect to de-0-esterification, which complicates quantitative analysis procedures. With respect to the enzymatic hydrolysis with sialidases, linkage specificity as well as a reduced or complete lack of susceptibility have to be taken into account. Moreover, in most cases much lower amounts of sialic acids are released by sialidases than by acid hydrolysis, which may be due to the different accessibility of the sialic acids in the biomolecules to be analyzed. Additionally, in work-up procedures and analyses, pH values below 4 and over 6 should be avoided to prevent migration of the 0-acetyl group at C7/C8 and hydrolysis of 0-acetyl groups as much as possible [23, 57] .",

Alternating a-2,8/a-2,9-polysialyl chains, as present in some bacterial polysaccharides, are also cleaved, but a-2,9-linked polysialyl chains are resistant. Poly-Kdn and {Neu5Gc(a2-05)}, are not substrates for endo-N. A similar endo-sialidase associated with phage particles, namely, E. coli bacteriophage $92, has been reviewed in ref. [261] .",

Because of the use of HCl, the method can be used to quantitate the total amount of both free and glycosidically bound sialic acids. Due to the strongly acidic conditions, ester groups are released. As the assay does not discriminate between bound and free sialic acids, it is widely used to monitor the presence of sialic acids in either form during fractionation of biological material.

The oxidation leads to the formation of a prechromogen, a six carbon aldehyde, which then yields the chromogen fi-formyl pyruvic acid by aldol cleavage between C4 and C5. The chromogen reacts with thiobarbituric acid to give a red chromophore, the absorbance of which is measured at 549 and 532nm. In principle two approaches can be followed, called the Warren method and the Aminoff method. Differences between the methods lie in the acidity of the initial periodate oxidation and in the solvent used for the extraction of the pigment (cyclohexanone, Warren; acidic 1-butanol, Aminoff). It should be noted that substituents in the glycerol side chain severely influence the periodate oxidation. Therefore, in the case of ester substituents, a prior saponification is necessary (0.1 M NaOH, 37\u00b0C). Types of free sialic acid which do not yield the chromogen are negative in this test. Several compounds have been shown to interfere with the periodate/thiobarbituric acid assay, most especially 2-deoxyribose, 2-keto-3-deoxyaldonic acids other than Kdn, disaccharides such as lactose and maltose, and unsaturated fatty acids. The greatest errors arise in the quantitation of sialic acids from cellular extracts or homogenates containing membrane and nucleic acid material. Therefore, prior ion-exchange column chromatography and removal of lipids by ether extraction are of advantage. Special attention to the periodic acidthiobarbituric acid assay of Kdn has been paid in ref. [243] .",

One of the most popular TLC methods for the analysis of (substituted) N-acylneuraminic acids comprises the use of plastic HPTLC plates precoated with cellulose and 1-propanol/l-butanol/O. 1 M HCl (2:1:1, v/v/v) as solvent system. It shows the best and most reproducible separation of different sialic acids, and is less sensitive to interfering substances when compared with other systems. Generally, the visualization of the different sialic acids is carried out by spraying with the orcinol/Fe3+/HC1 reagent [237] , yielding typical purple bands. For quantitative purposes densitometry is also used. It should be noted that due to differences in cellulose quality (impurities), even after pre-washing of the plates, the reproducibility of Rf values is relatively low. Therefore, analyses should be carried out in the presence of an appropriate reference sialic acid mixture on a separate lane. To give an impression of the separation capacity of cellulose plates, Table 7 summarizes the Rf values of a series Table 7 Thin-layer chromatographic migration rates (Rf) of sialic acids on 0.1 mm cellulose plates using 1-propanol/lbutanol/O.l M HCI (2: 1 : 1, v/v/v) [ of N, 0-acyl-neuraminic acids from one experiment [6] . In the case of radio-labelled sialic acids, the bands can also be traced by radio-TLC-scanning. Application of the TLC method in a two-dimensional procedure with intermediate ammonia treatment gives information about the type of N-acylneuraminic acid of the constituting NO-acylneuraminic acids. In this way a differentiation is possible for example between co-migrating Neu9AcSGc and Neu5,7Ac2 [6] . In principle, de-0-acetylations can also be carried out by sialate 0-acetylesterases [266] .",

In a different approach, fluorigenic derivatives of sialic acids, prepared by reaction with 1,2-diamin0-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB) in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and sodium hydrogensulfite, have been separated by C reversed-phase HPLC [27 1-2731, using acetonitrile/methanol/water (9:7:84, v/v/v) as solvent system and fluorescence monitoring at 373 nm excitation and 448 nm emission wavelengths. An appropriate cutoff filter may be used instead. The fluorescence labelling makes a relatively specific and highly sensitive (femto-to picomole range) detection possible. However, using radiolabelled sialic acids, it was found that the derivatization reaction is not quantitative [268] . For an adapted protocol, see ref. [l 11 . Another interesting approach is the conversion of NeuSAc/SGc into chemiluminescent quinoxalinone derivatives using 4,s-diaminophthalhydrazide dihydrochloride (a-keto acid derivatization) [274] .",

The general problem of quantification in PAD analyses, due to differences in detector response attributed to differences in the number of free hydroxyl groups of the various components separated, holds also for sialic acids. So far, only for a limited number of sialic acids relative detector response factors have been calculated (e.g. NeuSAc, 30 500; Neu5,9Ac2, 14 500; NeuSGc, 35 400) . It is important to note that pH values > 11, as usually applied in CarboPac-PAD analyses of oligosaccharides (for such a NeuSAc/NeuSGc separation, see ref. [28 l ]), will lead to rapid de-U-acylation of the 0-acylated sialic acids [282] .

This evaluation also compares a series of essential features of the five HPLC methods, namely, sensitivity, specificity of detection, separation by number of hydroxyl groups or substituents, separation of isomers, preparative use, avoiding of ester migration during purification, and avoiding of ester loss during purification. In this comparison [268, 270, 271, 283, 284] the HPLC systems I (CarboPac PA-I) and 111 (TSK-ODS 120T, DMB derivatives) gave the highest averaged scores in terms of applicability.

            "text": "In order to obtain information about the structure of sialic acids, HPLC is a very useful technique to be applied in combination with mild chemical or enzymatic degradation methods. For instance, HPLC before and after alkaline treatment of a mixture of 0-acylated sialic acids can give information about the de-0-acylated sialic acids present, e.g. in terms of their N-acyl substituents. Also the linkage specificity of sialidases in releasing sialic acids from sialoglycoconjugates (see section 5 .1) can be monitored by HPLC. Furthermore, the specificity of enzymes involved in sialic acid metabolism can be studied in this way. In this respect, interesting results have been obtained with aldolase, cleaving sialic acids to N-acylmannosamine derivatives and pyruvate, and with sialate 9-O-acetylesterase, hydrolyzing 0-acetyl groups from C9 of sialic acids. The aldolase degrades Neu5Ac faster than Neu5Gc; a slow degradation has been observed for 0-acylated sialic acids, not affecting 4-0-acetylated sialic acids at all [5] . A typical example of the HPLC analysis of enzyme reactions, in which esterase and aldolase are involved, and including the non-enzymatic conversion of an 0-acetyl group from C7 to C9, is presented in Fig. 5 [6, 7, 36] . Other examples are the determination of sialidase activity (sialyllactose as substrate, Neu5Ac as product, and Neu2en5Ac as inhibitor), CMP-Neu5Ac synthase activity (disappearance of NeuSAc, appearance of CMP-NeuSAc), CMP-Neu5Ac phosphodiesterase activity (appearance of NeuSAc, disappearance of CMP-Neu5Ac) [36] . Recently, 5-N-acetyl-9-0-acetyl-2-(N-dansyl-4-aminophenylthio)-a-neuraminic acid has been proposed as a highly sensitive fluorescent substrate for the HPLC measurement of sialate 9-0-acetylesterase (334 nm excitation, 564 nm emission) [285] . As a thioglycoside, the compound is very stable in acidic aqueous solution and towards enzymatic hydrolysis by sialidases. In this context, it is also worthwhile mentioning that a sensitive HPLC assay has been developed for the tracing of sialyltransferase activity, making use of the synthetic fluorigenic acceptor lactose 2-[(2-pyridyl)amino]ethyl glycoside [286] . Details for a HPLC separation of CMP-NeuSAc, CMP-NeuSGc and CMP-Kdn on a DC-613 cation-exchange column are reported in ref. [ ",

These compounds with a degree of polymerization up to 16 have been fractionated with varying results using conventional gel-filtration, TLC, DEAE-Sephadex A-25, and HPLC methods (see section 5.1 for preparation; see section 5.3.1 for TLC). A survey of literature has been included in ref. [287] . In general, mixtures of sialo-oligomers from (NeuSAc(a2-8)},, {NeuSAc(a2-9)},, {Neu5Gc(a2-8)},, or { Kdn(a2-8)}, can be isolated on a preparative scale via convential DEAE-Sephadex A-25 [256, 257] or DEAE-Toyopearl 650M [267] anion-exchange chromatography. HPLC procedures comprise anion-exchange and adsorption-partition chromatography. A mixture of { NeuSAc(a2-8)}2-16 has been efficiently separated on a Zorbax SAX anion-exchange column using 0.2-1 M NaCl in lOmM phosphate buffer pH 3.5 [287] . Also adsorptionpartition chromatography on polystyrene DC-6 13 using mixtures of 0.02-0.025 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and acetonitrile as solvent system, has shown good results [267] . On Mono Q anion-exchange columns, excellent results were obtained in the separation of { N e u S A~( a 2 -8 ) )~-~~, {Ne~5Gc(a2-8)}~_lo, or {Kdn(a2-8)}~_~ after conversion into alditols with NaBH4 (or NaBT4), and using a NaCl gradient in Tris-HC1 buffer pH 8 as elution system [267, 288] . In this context, several studies have focused on the determination of the chain lengths of sialo-oligomers and -polymers (for a review of methods currently employed in the analysis of polysialic acids, see ref. [289] ), and recently a highly detailed adapted methodology for the analysis of a-2,8-linked sialooligomers and -polymers has appeared [290] . Using three variable assay procedures, providing overlapping information, details could be provided with respect to the degree of polymerization, the simultaneous identification of NeuSAc, Neu5Gc and Kdn when present in a single preparation, and the ability to distinguish qualitatively between reducing and non-reducing polymers. The developed approach may include mild periodate oxidation (degradation of non-reducing terminal unit) in combination with reduction (degraded glycerol side chain yielding C7-sialic acid; reducing unit if present affording the corresponding stereoisomeric alditols), whereas monomer analysis is carried out after sialidase or acid hydrolysis on CarboPac PA-1 with pulsed amperometric detection.",

Using the conditions of the standard quantitative monosaccharide analysis of glycoconjugates, de-N-acylatiodde-esterification takes place, which means that NO-acylneuraminic acid residues are converted into neuraminic acid methyl ester methyl glycoside (8, -96%; a, -4%). For the characterization by GLC the sialic acid methyl ester methyl glycoside is derivatized via N-acetylatiodtrimethylsilylation or pertrifluoroacetylation [241] . It should be noted that during the N-acetylation step H09 of NeuSAc, when not substituted, is partially 0-acetylated (-4%). Using milder methanolysis conditions [242] , an N-acetylation step is not necessary, yielding a method to determine both Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc by GLC. In principle, the latter approach is also suitable to determine sialic acids bearing only 0-alkyl groups. GLC analysis is generally carried out on SE-30 type column materials.",

With respect to silylation cocktails, it should be noted that N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-2,2,2-trifluoroacetamide/pyridine leads to the formation of N-trimethylsilyl derivatives, yielding two different peaks for each sialic acid [36, 305] . Subsequent GLC analysis is generally carried out on SE-30 or OV-17 type column materials. Both types of derivatives are highly suitable for MS analysis, and GLC coupled with electron impact (EI) MS formed the basis for the development of a highly reliable mass spectrometric method for the identification of sialic acids.

            "text": "Typical derivatives are trimethylsilylated methyl ester or pertrimethylsilylated derivatives of N, 0-acylneuraminic acids or of N-acyl-0-alkylneuraminic acids, acetylated N-acyl- 0-alkylneuraminic acid methyl ester methyl glycosides, trimethylsilylatedrnethylated N,N-acy1,methyl-neuraminic acid methyl ester methyl glycosides (methylation analysis), and acetylatedmethylated N,N-acy1,methyLneuraminic acid methyl ester methyl glycosides (methylation analysis). The determination of the type, number, and position of the 0-acyl or 0-alkyl groups as well as the type of the N-acyl group in neuraminic acids is facilitated by the highly specific EI mass spectra of the derivatized compounds. In Fig. 6 , a schematic survey is depicted showing the selected fragment ions A-H, which furnish the information (abundances and mlz values of the ions) necessary to deduce the complete structure of the sialic acids. Fragments A and B indicate the molecular mass of the sialic acid derivatives and thereby the type and the number of substituents. Fragments C-H can be used for the determination of the positions of the different substituents. Fragment A is formed from the molecular ion by the elimination of a methyl group originating from a trimethylsilyl substituent in trimethylsilylated (0-acylated0-alkylated) N-acylneuraminic acid derivatives. When RSI = CH3 (methylation analysis), the eliminated methyl group can also originate from the NN-acy1,methyl group. Fragment B is formed by elimination of the Cl part of the molecule. Eliminations of OCOCH3 in 0-acylated sialic acid derivatives and of NH2COCH3 in N-acetylneuraminic acid derivatives, which in principle give rise to the same mlz value as fragment B in the case of R1 =CH3, can be neglected. For 0-trimethylsilylated N 0-acylneuraminic acids (B-anomers) it holds that, when compared to their methyl esters, in their trimethylsilyl esters the intensity of fragment A decreases relative to B. Fragment C is formed by elimination of C8-C9, with localization of the charge on position 7. In general, cleavage occurs between two alkoxylated carbon atoms, or between an acetoxylated and an alkoxylated carbon atom, rather than between two acetoxylated carbon atoms. In accordance with the fragmentation rules for partially methylated alditol acetates [306] , the charge is preferentially located on an ether oxygen instead of on an ester oxygen. Therefore, fragment C has only significant abundance if C7 bears an ether group. When an ester group is present at C7, this fragment ion is absent or hardly observable. Fragment D is formed from fragment C by consecutive eliminations of R20H and R40H. It is evident that the occurrence of this fragment ion is dependent on the presence of fragment C. Fragment E is formed by elimination of the whole side-chain C7-C8-C9 and the substituent at C5. This fragment ion is not observed if an 0-acyl group is attached to C4, illustrating that the transition state in the McLafferty rearrangement is more favored when the substituent at C4 is an ether group rather than an ester group. For 0-trimethylsilylated N, 0-acylneuraminic acids (B-anomers) it holds that, when compared to their methyl esters, in their trimethylsilyl esters the intensity of fragment E is much reduced but still present; instead, an additional fragment derived from fragment E by loss of Me3SiOH is clearly present. Fragment F contains C8-C9. Based on the same fragmentation rules as mentioned above for fragments C and D, this ion can only readily be formed if an ether group is attached to C8. Fragment G consists of the C4-CS part of the molecule. Fragment H, necessary to use for derivatives containing only 0-alkyl substituents, is formed by elimination of the C9 part, followed by elimination of R4OH and R70H. For instance, this fragment is useful to discriminate between an OSiMe3 group at C8 or C9 in trimethylsilylated partially methylated N-acylneuraminic acids. Finally, for quadrupole analyzers, in the high mass range the fragment ions A, B and C often are of low intensity, especially when only small amounts of material are available. In Table 9 a survey is presented of GLC retention times and of characteristic EI MS fragment ions for a series of naturally occurring sialic acids, analyzed as their trimethylsilylated methyl ester or as their pertrimethylsilylated derivatives [6,11,15,3 1,38,43,307] . Although the sialic acids predominantly occur in the B-anomeric form, the a-anomer could occasionally be detected separately from the B-anomer, in most cases as a small shoulder. As a typical example, in Figs. 7a,b the EI mass spectra of the trimethylsilylated methyl ester of B-NeuSAc and of the pertrimethylsilylated derivative of P-NeuSAc, respectively, are depicted. Additional spectra have been published in refs. [ 15, 43, 304, 307] . For a detailed survey of fragment ions of other derivatives mentioned, including mass spectra, and those obtained from periodate-oxidized sialic acids (C7-NeuSAc, C8-NeuSAc, C7-NeuSGc and C8-NeuSAc), see refs. [15, 308] ; for EI MS data of Neu4,8anSAc, see ref. [63] ; for EI MS data of permethylated Kdn, see ref. [46] .",

Direct peracylation failed to produce suitable derivatives, but reduction under acidic conditions followed by peracylation (perdeuteroacetylation or perpropionylation) gave good results. Generally, the sialic acids give rise to two major pseudomolecular ions, corresponding to the peracylated open chain form and an open-chain-derived lactone form, and a minor pseudomolecular ion corresponding to an open-chain-derived anhydrofonn (2,6 and/or 4,8). As the lactone peak is markedly reduced in the spectrum of Neu4,5Ac2, H 0 4 seems to be mainly involved in the lactonization. In the case of sialic acid mixtures, a fast sialic acid subgroup analysis based on molecular masses is possible; again, a differentiation between positional isomers cannot be achieved. Careful analysis of the negative FAB spectra of reduced and perpropionylated sialic acids in mixtures demonstrated that these spectra could also be used for quantitative purposes. As worked out for mixtures of NeuSAc, Neu5,9Ac2 and NeuSGc, an estimate of the relative amounts of these sialic acids can be given with an error of 1 &I 5%, when the sum of the intensities of the [M + HIf ions of the linear and the lactone forms of each component is compared, taking into account that the molar response of Neu5Gc is approximately 50% of that of Neu5Ac.",

            "text": "As a typical example of a free sialic acid, in Fig. 8 the 500MHz 'H NMR spectrum of Neu5Ac in D20 at pD 7 is depicted. The spectrum shows a minor and a major set of protons, reflecting the subspectra of the aand p-anomer of NeuSAc, respectively (a$ = 7:93), and especially the H3e,3a signals, resonating outside the bulk signal, can be used for the differentiation between both anomers. The effect of pH on the proton chemical shifts is clearly illustrated by respectively, and at pD 7.0 at 6 2.730 and 6 1.621, respectively. Over the years, a large number of (naturally occurring) sialic acids and related derivatives have been analyzed, and in [46] , and those of CMP-9amino-NeuSAc and CMP-9NAc-NeuSAc in ref. [316] . ' H NMR spectroscopy has shown to be an excellent method to monitor chemical and biochemical conversions of sialic acids, directly in the NMR-tube or by analysis of isolated reaction products. A typical example is the demonstration of the release of a-NeuSAc as the primary product of bacterial and viral sialidase action on Neu5Ac(a2-glycosides and oligosaccharides [3 17-3201. The initial formation of a-NeuSAc, as traced by 'H NMR spectroscopy, formed an excellent probe to investigate the kinetics of the mutarotation of NeuSAc by means of 'H NMR analysis in dependency of the pH [321] . At pD 5.4 the establishment of the equilibrium of mutarotation turned out to be rather slow, but at higher and lower pD values a more rapid establishment was observed, so that at pD 1.3 and pD 11.7 mutarotation was too fast to be measured. With the ability to generate a-NeuSAc in situ, the aldolase-catalyzed degradation of NeuSAc to pyruvate and N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) could also be investigated in more detail using ' H NMR spectroscopy [322] . Using sialidase (pH optimum 5.4) and aldolase (pH optimum 7.2) from C. perfringens and N-acetyl-2-azido-2-deoxy-a-neuraminic acid as substrate at pH 5.4, only released a-NeuSAc was found to be consumed by the aldolase, yielding specifically a-ManNAc followed by a fast mutarotation to a,P-ManNAc. These findings confirmed earlier work using Neu5Ac(a2-3)lactose as a-Neu5Ac-generating system and crystalline b-NeuSAc [319] . In the reversed reaction a-ManNAc is the substrate [322] . For more details about the aldolase-catalyzed degradation, see section 9.3. In connection with these studies, it has to be noted that under comparable conditions the activities of sialidase and aldolase in D20 are only about 50% of those in H20. With respect to 0-acetyl migrations, also the earlier mentioned (see section 2) spontaneous conversion at physiological pH of Neu5,7Ac2 into Neu5,9Ac2 and of Neu5,7,9Ac3 into Neu5,8,9Ac3 has been monitored by ' H NMR spectroscopy [23] . Furthermore, the NMR approach has shown its value in the determination of substrate specificities of various sialidases using substrates with differently linked sialic acid residues [323-3251. ",

In fact, H3a can be exchanged in the pH range 6.5-9.0, and the H-D exchange is reversible. In the 'H NMR spectrum the H3a signal disappears, and the coupling patterns of H3e and H4 alter. At pD 12.4, H3e can also be replaced by a D-atom [327] . On the basis of this finding, the exchange experiments were also carried out in T20, yielding T-labelled NeuSAc, which was converted enzymatically into T-labelled CMP-Neu5Ac [326] . In glycosidically linked NeuSAc the H3 atoms are not exchangeable, rendering this specific labelling technique suitable for sialyltransferase experiments.",

            "text": "In the H NMR structural-reporter-group concept, developed for the structural analysis of glycoprotein N-and 0-glycans, advantage is taken of the fact that a number of the H-atoms of the constituting monosaccharides, pccurring in special microenvironments, resonate outside the bulk-signal region [76, 77, 328] . In the case of glycosidically linked a-sialic acids the structural reporters are the H3a-and H3e-atoms, and the N-acetyl or N-glycolyl groups. The positions of the H3a,3e signals reflect not only structural information with respect to the type of sialic acid present, but also with respect to the coupled monosaccharide in terms of type of linkage and type of monosaccharide. Furthermore, 0-acyl substituents induce additional shifts for other H-atoms. In Table 11 a survey is presented of chemical shifts of H3e and H3a signals of sialic acid residues occurring in different linkage types as part of N-and 0-glycans. For a further fine-tuning of the chemical shifts within the presented ranges, influenced by the different microenvironments wherein the sialic acid residues occur, see refs. [76, 77] and the references cited in Table 2 . It should be noted that the presence of a certain sialic acid in a certain linkage also influences the structural-reportergroup signals of other monosaccharide residues [76, 77] . More detailed information with respect to the H3e,3a chemical shifts of sialic acids in sialo-oligomers and -polymers can be obtained from refs. [31, 47, 77, 329, 330] . A series of H3a,3e signals of sialic acids in milk-and glycolipid-derived oligosaccharides have been included in ref. [77] . More general NMR data of glycosidically linked sialic acids in glycolipids, milk and urinary oligosaccharides and (lipo)polysaccharides, if available, can be found in the references cited in Tables 3-5 (see also ref. [331] ). For a series of sialocarbohydrates, it has been shown that H6 of NeuSAc, easily traced from the TOCSY H3a,H6 correlation, also has potential value for discriminating between a-2,3-(6 3.63 & 0.01 1) and a-2,6-(6 3.70 * 0.01 7) linked NeuSAc in NeuSAc(a2-3/6)Gal(~l-O)R/NeuSAc(a2- [33 13 . However, for branched oligosaccharides, this rule is not valid if the monosaccharide in the branching position is in the alditol form [332] .",

Synthetic as well as biosynthetic routes for the preparation of sialic acids, sialic acid derivatives, analogues, glycosides and sialoglycoconjugates have been explored. The main reason for this considerable interest in preparing sialic acids and sialic-acidcontaining compounds lies in the fact that sialic acids were found to be among the most biologically important carbohydrate units in glycoconjugates. The progress in organic synthetic protocols and the availability of relevant enzymes in suitable amounts made it realistic to develop the sialic acid field from a preparative synthetic side. Initially, the main tools were to prepare suitable derivatives to study the properties of sialic acids, or to prepare substrates and inhibitors for sialidases, sialyltransferases or for sialic acid converting enzymes. Although these tools are still highly relevant, the preparation of sialo-oligosaccharides using strictly organic synthetic or enzymatic methods, or a mixture of both, are also receiving considerable attention. For relevant reviews on preparative (bio)synthetic aspects, see refs. [339,344-3531. 6 .1. Free sialic acids Several protocols have been followed for the organic chemical synthesis of NeuSAc. At first, the approaches were based on condensation reactions of (derivatives of) N-acetyl-D-mannosamine (ManNAc) or N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) with (derivatives of) oxaloacetic acid (for a review, see ref. [3] ), however, the yields were very low. In this context, a procedure was worked out, that allowed modifications at Cl-C3 [354] . A total synthesis of NeuSAc from non-carbohydrate precursors has been reported in ref. [355] . Using a protocol for indium-mediated allylations of aldehydes, NeuSAc was prepared in good yields from a ManNAc precursor [356] . Furthermore, synthetic routes for NeuSAc have been proposed, based upon 1 -deoxy-1 -nitro-sugar chemistry, that should also allow the preparation of NeuSAc analogues, modified at several carbon atoms of the skeleton [357-3591. A separate route also yielded NeuSAc [360] . A synthesis starting with the aldol condensation of D-glucose (Glc) and oxaloacetic acid, followed by adaptation of the substituent at C5 has been described in ref. [361] . More recently, another approach for the organic synthesis of NeuSAc and NeuSAc derivatives, based on the cis-selective Wittig reaction of benzoyl 2,3-O-isopropylidene-a-~-lyxo-pentodialdo-1,4-furanoside with [(3S)-3,4-(isopropylidenedioxy)butyl]-triphenylphosphonium iodide as a first step, has been reported in ref. [362] . Comments on the acetylation of NeuSAc and its methyl ester have been published in ref. [363] . Starting from NeuSAc, in some derivatization reactions 1,4-as well as 1,7-lactone formation has been observed [349] . For the organic synthesis of Kdn, several routes were employed [364-3681, among them procedures starting from NeuSAc or from D-mannOSe (Man).",

            "text": "NeuSAc-aldolase-catalyzed condensations of ManNAc and pyruvate [3, 33] , initially only investigated to understand sialic acid metabolism, have been optimized for preparative purposes. In principle, ManNAc can be generated from the cheaper GlcNAc in an alkaline epimerization process, yielding an epimeric mixture of which only the monosaccharide with the D-manno-configuration is recognized by the aldolase [369, 370] . However, ManNAc can also be generated from GlcNAc in a GlcNAc-epimerasecatalyzed isomerization [37 I] . A multigram-scale enzymatic synthesis based on the aldol condensation of ManNAc and pyruvate in the presence of phosphate, catalyzed by immobilized microbial NeuSAc-aldolase, has been reported [372] . A similar approach, using the aldolase enclosed in a dialysis membrane instead of being immobilized, has also been described [373] . Although in uiuo, the conversion of Neu5Ac into Neu5Gc occurs exclusively on the level of activated sialic acid (see section 8.4 .1), Neu5Gc can be prepared in uitro by incubating a mixture of N-glycolyl-D-mannosaminelN-glycolyl-D-glucosamine and pyruvate with immobilized aldolase [374] . Interestingly, a series of other sugars also turned out to be accepted by the aldolase, and Man and 2-deoxy-D-glucose in particular are excellent substrates [372,375-3771. In the case of Man as starting material, relatively moderate amounts of Kdn have been prepared [254, 376] .",

            "text": "For the study of biochemical pathways, several isotopically labelled sialic acids and sialic acid derivatives have been prepared, both by enzyme-catalyzed synthesis and by organic synthesis. A survey of labelled sialic acids is presented in Table 12 [107, 344, 386] . In enzymatic procedures, use is generally made of the aldolase-catalyzed condensation of N-acybmannosamines and (phosphoenol)pyruvate, suitably labelled in one or both of the two synthons. For the preparation of N-[l-'4C]acetyl-and N -[ I-'4C]glycolylneuraminic acid, as well as O-['4C]acetylated sialic acids, surviving slices of submaxillary salivary glands incubated with [ 1 -I4C]acetate, followed by isolation of the glycoprotein fraction and mild acid hydrolysis, have been used. A number of these labelled sialic acids have been converted into their CMP-glycosides, and subsequently incorporated into glycoconjugates (see section 6.3). Of course, labelling of glycoconjugates can also be carried out by periodate oxidatiodtritiated borohydride reduction, thereby converting sialic acids, if chemically possible, into their radiolabelled C7 and C8 analogues. Using the latter approach, fluorescent probes (dansylhydrazine, dansylethylenediamine, fluoresceinamine) and EPR spin labels can also be incorporated (see references cited in ref. [344] ). The same holds for glycine [387] . Table 12 Survey of radiolabelled sialic acidsa Several interesting sialic acid variants and sialic acid derivatives have been synthesized, and a list is presented in Table . Both organic synthetic and aldolase-catalyzed routes have been followed. The major part of these compounds were prepared to study sialic acid metabolism (aldolase, CMP-NeuSAc synthase), sialic acid transfer (sialyltransferases), sialic acid release (sialidases), inhibition phenomena, or hemagglutinin-sialic acid interactions, and biological details are presented in sections 8-10. Compounds reported up to 1982 have been reviewed earlier [344] . Of special interest are the fluorescent and photoactivatable sialic acid derivatives [390,4 191 , which can be applied, after conversion into their corresponding CMP-glycosides, to detect enzyme activities or to follow biological processes (see sections 6.2 and 8.2). In the context of sialic acid variants, the following compounds are also of interest. In view of the similarity in acidity of a tetrazoie group and a carboxyl function, a variant of Neu5Ac has been prepared containing a CN4H instead of a COOH group [447] . Also the synthesis of a series of Neu5Ac derivatives with specifically introduced tert-butyldimethylsilyl groups have been reported [400, 448] . Furthermore, variants of 2d-2Ha-NeuSAc and 2d-2He,-NeuSAc, in which the carboxyl function has been replaced by a phosphono (PO3H2) group [449] , and a phosphonic acid analogue of Neu2en5Ac [450] , have been synthesized. In addition to 6-amino-2,6-dideoxy-sialic acids, as mentioned in Table 13 , the preparation of 2-C-hydroxymethyl derivatives [45 I] , and C6 and C7 analogues [452] have also been reported.

One of the famous condensation reactions (classical Koenigs-Knorr method) comprised the silver carbonate-promoted condensation of 5-N-acetyl-4,7,8,9-tetra-O-acetyl-2-chloro-2-deoxy-(3-neuraminic acid or the corresponding methyl ester (Fig. 9 , structure A) with the appropriate alcohol, followed by removal of the protecting groups. In order to improve the yields, much attention has been paid to better catalysts. In these glycosidation reactions typical side reactions are the formation of unsaturated sialic acid derivatives (elimination of HCl) and of (3-glycosides (see section 6.3). For the preparation of simple (3-glycosides, N-acylneuraminic acids are often heated with the appropriate alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst, followed by saponification of the formed ester. However, complex alcohols give rise to problems (for a review, see ref. [344] ).

            "text": "For the detection of sialidase activity both (naturally occurring) oligosaccharides and simple a-glycosides are used. In these assays, two approaches can be followed, namely, determination of the released (modified) sialic acid or identification of the released aglycon. In the case of a-glycosides, in which the released aglycon concentration is measured spectrophotometrically or detected on solid supports, substrates with synthetically introduced aglycons having specific chromogenic properties, are used. Among such substrates, released aglycons can be detected directly or after condensation with specific reagents. One of the oldest substrates is the 4-nitrophenyl glycoside of a-NeuSAc [456] , whereby released 4-nitrophenol is estimated by absorption at 400nm. In an adapted synthetic version, the compound has been prepared by coupling of 5-N-acetyl-4,7,8,9-tetra-O-acetyl-2-chloro-2-deoxy-(3-neuraminic acid methyl ester with sodium-nitrophenoxide in N, N-dimethylformamide, and subsequent deprotection [460] . Another suitable substrate is the 3-methoxyphenyl glycoside of a-NeuSAc, synthesized by coupling of 5-N-acetyl-4,7,8,9-tetra-O-acetyl-2-chloro-2deoxy-(3-neuraminic acid with 3-methoxyphenol in the presence of silver carbonate, followed by de-0-acetylation. Liberated 3-methoxyphenol is determined after coupling with the diazonium salt of 4-amino-2,5-dimethoxy-4'-nitroazobenzene (red colored product) [461] or with 4-aminoantipyrine in the presence of the oxidizing agent potassium ferricyanide (colored quinone) [462] . The most popular fluorigenic substrate is the 4-methylumbelliferyl glycoside of a-NeuSAc, which is prepared by different methods [344] . A convenient synthesis is the condensation of 5-N-acetyl-4,7,8,9-tetra-O-acetyl-2-chloro-2-deoxy-~-neuraminic acid methyl ester with the sodium salt of 4-methylumbelliferone in N,N-dimethylformamide, followed by deprotection [463] . Released 4-methylumbelliferone is measured at 360 nm (excitation)/440 nm (emission). Although the 4-methylumbelliferyl glycoside of a-Kdn has been synthesized starting from Neu5Ac [445] , also a direct route using the glycosyl chloride of peracetylated b-Kdn methyl ester and the sodium salt of 4-methylumbelliferone has been explored [254] .",

The synthesis of CMP-sialic acids is generally carried out enzymatically using CTP and CMP-sialic acid synthase as a catalyst [33,3 14,370,47 1,4721 . A multigram-scale one-pot synthesis of CMP-@-NeuSAc has been reported in ref. [473] . ManNAc, prepared by basecatalyzed epimerization of GlcNAc, was reacted with sodium pyruvate in the presence of NeuSAc-aldolase to yield NeuSAc (see section 6.1). For the formation of CMP-NeuSAc, CTP was generated in situ from CMP by using adenylate kinase, pyruvate kinase, and phosphoenolpyruvate, and reacted with NeuSAc in the presence of CMP-NeuSAc synthase (Fig. 10) . Instead of a one-pot synthesis, for practical reasons it is easier to generate and store crude solutions of NeuSAc and CTP. For the use of GlcNAc in combination with GlcNAc-epimerase, see ref. [474] . Experiments with cloned CMP-NeuSAc synthases from E. coli systems with NeuSAc and Kdn showed a high specificity for NeuSAc, thereby suggesting that in this case the 5-acetamido group is critical [384] . Chemical syntheses of CMP-NeuSAc, applying the phosphoramidite method [475] or using sialyl phosphites [476] , have also been described. Furthermore, a synthetic approach for the preparation of CMP-NeuSGc based on the phosphite method has appeared [477] .",

            "text": "In addition to CMP-p-NeuSAc, CMP-@-Neu5,9Ac2, CMP-b-NeuSGc, and CMP-8-Kdn, a large series of artificial CMP-sialic acids have been prepared biochemically on microscale starting from the corresponding sialic acid (see references cited in Table 13) and CTP. Among them are CMP-9azido-NeuSAc, CMP-9amino-NeuSAc, CMP-9NAc-NeuSAc and other C9-modified CMP-sialic acids, CMP-NeuSAcNH2, CMP-NeuSAc4Me, and CMP-4d-NeuSAc [33,3 14,350,390,407,419,4781 . The CMP-sialic acids have found a broad application in enzymatic sialylations using different sialyltransferases (see sections 6.3 and 8.3). Several of the artificial CMP-sialic acids turned out to be suitable donors for asialo-a, -acid glycoprotein as acceptor with Gal(@lH)GlcNAc a-2,6-sialyltransferase from rat liver as a biocatalyst [3 16,402,4171 . The transfer of CMP-9amino-NeuSAc is of considerable interest, as a-linked 9amino-NeuSAc in sialoglycoconjugates is not a substrate for bacterial, viral or mammalian sialidases tested so far. CMP-9amino-NeuSAc and CMP-NeuSAcNHz have also been used as synthons to prepare fluorescent and photoactivatable analogues [419] . Because of the defined acceptor specificity, sialyltransferases in combination with fluorescent or photoactivatable donor CMP-sialic acids are excellent tools for selective introduction of a fluorescent or photoactivatable substituent to a distinct glycoconjugate. The latter reference [4 191 also includes kinetic data and information concerning the fluorimetric sialyltransferase assay. Typical fluorescent products comprise the CMP-sialic acids of S-N-acetyl-9-deoxy-9-(3-fluoresceinylthioureido)-neuraminic acid (CMP-9fluoresceinyl-Neu5Ac), 5-N-acetyl-9-(7-amino-4-methylcoumarinyl)acetamido-9-deoxy-neuraminic acid (CMP-9AMCA-NeuSAc), 5-N-acetyl-9-deoxy-9-(fluoresceinylaminomonochlorotriazinyl)amino-neuraminic acid (CMP-~MTAF-N~USAC), and N-(3-fluoresceinylthioureido-acetyl)neuraminic acid (CMP-NeuSfluoresceinyl). In the preparation of photoactivatable derivatives the NH29 group of CMP-9amino-NeuSAc has been substituted with a 4-azidobenzoyl, a 4-azidosalicyl, a 4-benzoylbenzoyl or a 4-azido[T]benzoyl group. In a similar way, CMP-NeuSAcNH2 has been labeled with a 4-azidobenzoyl group. Of special interest is the recently reported chemical synthesis of CMP-{NeuSAc(a2-8)NeuSAc} [479] ; an attempt to prepare this compound biosynthetically with NeuSAc(a2-8)NeuSAc and CMP-sialic acid synthase failed so far [472] . In addition to the preparation of regular CMP-sialic acids, synthetic approaches have been worked out for the organic synthesis of a S-(N-acetylneuraminy1)nucleoside analogue [480,48 11 and other CMP-sialic acid variants [482] .",

The preparation of an affinity adsorbent with immobilized sialic acid through a thioglycosidic linkage has been described in ref. [483] . Synthetic sialidase-stable a-Neu5,9Ac2 p-aminophenylthio glycoside has been immobilized directly or by a six-carbon long spacer group to agarose for lectin isolations [382] . The allyl glycoside of a-NeuSAc has been applied as a starting material for the synthesis of NeuSAc-neoglycoproteins and pseudopolysaccharides. These polymers containing multivalent sialic acid are in principle useful for various applications related with recognitionhindinglinhibition processes. Reductive ozonolysis of the allyl group (03, then MezS), followed by coupling of the formed aldehyde to protein carriers (E-aminogroup of lysine) by sodium cyanoborohydride-mediated reductive amination, yielded neoglycoproteins with varying amounts of NeuSAc [484, 485] . Copolymerization of the allyl glycoside with acrylamide generated a water-soluble pseudopolysaccharide [484] . In order to create a longer spacer arm for copolymerization with acrylamide, the allyl glycoside was converted into a 3-(2-aminoethylthio)propyl glycoside by reaction with cysteamine hydrochloride, after which the amino function was N-acryloylated [486] . The same principle of conjugation or copolymerization via N-acryloyl groups was also used for the preparation of sialo-oligosaccharide-neoglycoproteins and copolymers of sialo-oligosaccharides and acrylamide [487] . Using the strategy of reductive amination, p-formylphenyl glycoside of a-NeuSAc was also conjugated with proteins [488] , and starting from the p-nitrophenyl 0and S-glycosides, p-N-acryloylamino analogues were synthesized, which could be copolymerized with acrylamide, yielding water-soluble pseudopolysaccharides with Neu5Ac and acrylamide in different ratios [489] , or directly coupled with polylysine [490] . Using trimethyl orthoacetate, the NeuSAc residue of the S-glycoside-containing polymer was converted into Neu5,9Ac2 [489] . Finally, a series of interesting NeuSAc and Neu5,9Ac2-based dendrimers have been synthesized [49 11.",

Secondly, from a steric point of view, the carboxyl function restricts the glycoside formation. Thirdly, the presence of a neighboring methylene group in the ring (C3), instead of a substituted carbon atom, eliminates the possible assisting andor directing effect of an adjacent substituent [346] . This means that side reactions can be relatively important, mainly the thermodynamically favored fi-glycoside and 2,3-dehydro-derivative formation, and low yields are quite often obtained. Initially, the synthesized glycosidic linkages comprised mainly NeuSAc(a2-6)Gal(fi 1-, NeuSAc(a24)GlcNAc((3 1-, NeuSAc(a2-6)Glc(fll-, NeuSAc(a2-3)Gal((3 1-, NeuSAc(a2-3)GlcNAc(fl1- [344] , and over the years these glycosidic linkages, together with NeuSAc(a24)GalNAc(al-, still receive most of the attention. In view of the desire to prepare biologically relevant carbohydrate chains, this is understandable.",

            "text": "A third type of donor involves the use of S-methyl or S-phenyl a-glysosides (Fig. 9 , structure G) [498, . Initially developed to synthesize S-glycosides, making use of sodium salts of the peracetylated Neu5Ac methyl ester aor 8-thioglycosides and suitable protected bromides [504-5061 (see also refs. [507, 508] ), this type of donors has shown to be highly attractive in 0-glycosidation reactions. In these couplings, frequently used promoters are dimethyl(methy1thio)sulfonium triflate or N-iodosuccinimideltriflic acid [347] . The choice of the solvent system is very important, as it greatly influences the stereoselectivity; e.g. acetonitrile gives mainly a-glycosidation. In addition to reports dealing with the synthesis of many monosialo-oligosaccharides, including those with a NeuSAc(a2-2)Glc, a NeuSAc(a2-3)GlcNAc, and a NeuSAc(a2-3)GalNAc sequence [509] , typical examples are the creation of NeuSAc(2-9)NeuSAc [5 10,5 1 11 and NeuSAc(a2-8)NeuSAc [512] linkages, as well as sialyl LeX sequences (native and variants) (ref. [513] and references cited therein). In this context, it is also interesting to note that several syntheses of sialo-oligosaccharides include the use of a separately prepared disaccharide donor with a terminal a-linked sialic acid [514] . Although in general the donors contain a N-acetyl group at C5, other examples have been reported with the phthaloyl (benzeneselenenyl triflate as a promoter [5 151) or the tert-butoxycarbonyl function as N-protecting group, e.g. in the case of the synthesis of Neu-containing glycoconjugates [5 16,5 171 . Following similar routes, Kdn-containing oligosaccharides have also been synthesized [5 181 . As a variation on this theme, the application of S-sialyl xanthates (SCSOEt) as donors in sialo-oligosaccharide synthesis has led to interesting results, including a high a-stereoselectivity [5 19-5221 . Here, also the use of 0-benzoyl protection instead of 0-acetyl protection has been proposed [523, 524] . Furthermore, the preparation of sialic acid S-glycosyl donors employing S,S'-bis( 1-phenyl-1H-tetrazol-5-y1)dithiocarbonate should be mentioned [525] . Another efficient donor combines parts of the structures F and G, yielding an a-thioglycoside with a SPh substituent at C3 (Fig. 9 , structure H) [526] . The high stereoselective a-sialylation was obtained using either methyl sulfenyl bromide/silver triflate or N-iodosuccinimide/triflic acid as promoters.",

To solve the problem of the poor enzymatic a-2,3-sialylation of Gal 2-(trimethylsily1)ethyl (3-glycoside using all known a-2,3-sialyltransferases and CMP-NeuSAc, attention has been paid to the development of a sequence of enzymatic reactions, including cloned a-2,3-sialyltransferase and CMP-NeuSAc synthase, yielding an alternative active sialyl-donor-substrate in situ (e.g. NeuSAc(a2-3)1acto-N-tetraose), which can be used by trans-sialidase [554] . In this way it was possible to convert Gal 2-(trimethylsi1yl)ethyl P-glycoside into NeuSAc(a2-3)Gal 2-(trimethylsily1)ethyl 13-glycoside, a sialodisaccharide that can readily be transformed into a disaccharide donor, of interest for additional organic syntheses.

In an additional study, the crystal and molecular structure of a-NeuSAc1,2Me2 was also analyzed [565] . The C=O bond of the COOH function is approximately coplanar with the ring C-0 bond in a-NeuSAcl,2Me2, whereas in both P-NeuSAc and P-NeuSAclMe the C=O bond is found to be nearly eclipsed with the anomeric C-0 bond. In all three derivatives, the N-acetyl group is essentially planar, adopting the Z-conformation of a peptide bond. For a-NeuSAc 1,2Me2 and P-NeuSAclMe a hydrogen bond between the H-atom of H 0 7 and the carbonyl 0-atom of AcNHS was observed. The overall conformation of the glycerol side chain is the same for all three derivatives, as far as non-H atoms are concerned. In a-NeuSAc1,2Me2 a hydrogen bond between the H-atom of H 0 8 and the carbonyl 0-atom of the COOMe group is detectable. One of the oldest NMR studies on the conformation of NeuSAc is that focused on the spatial structure of aNeuSAc2Me in D20 [566, 567] . On the basis of 'H-'H coupling constants in combination with 13C spinlattice relaxation times (TI), a model could be constructed in which the amide H-atom of AcNHS is hydrogen-bonded to 0 7 , and the H-atom of H 0 8 is hydrogen-bonded to the ring-oxygen. A third hydrogen bond between the carbonyl 0-atom of AcNHS and the H-atom of H 0 4 was suggested on the basis of molecular model building. In this model, apparently, the anomeric center is not involved in any hydrogen bonding, leading to the same conformation for aand p-anomers. Independent of the models discussed above, the results fit the observation made by 'H NMR spectroscopy that H 0 7 and H 0 8 usually occur in a tuuns-orientation [53] . An NMR (H2O-suppressed 1 D TOCSY, ROESY, NOESY) study, carried out on NeuSAc(a2-3)Gal(~14)GlcNAc and NeuSAc(a2-6)Gal(B 14)GlcNAc in 85% H20/15% (CD3)2CO, and aimed to detect hydroxyl and amido protons, indicated that in both compounds, thus irrespective of the type of linkage, the H-atom of H 0 8 of NeuSAc is involved in a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond [568] .",

Use was made of 'H and l3C NMR spectroscopy, including NOE measurements, combined with hard-sphere calculations. From a comparison of the four side chain conformations in aqueous solution at neutral pH, it was concluded that the absence of activation of 8epi-NeuSAc may be due to diminished binding interactions between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions of this sialic acid and the activating enzyme, when compared with the other three sialic acids. In additional studies 7d-, 8d-, and 9d-NeuSAc and 4,7d2-NeuSAc were also investigated [570] .",

            "text": "Nowadays, much attention is paid to the conformational analysis of glycoprotein glycans, including combinations of NMR spectroscopy and molecular modelling programs, and with respect to sialic-acid-containing fragments the sequences NeuSAc(a2-6)Gal(B 1-4)GlcNAcfi 1-, Neu5Aca2-3Gal~14GlcNAc~ I-, and NeuSAca2-3Galfi 14 [Fuc(a 1-3) ]-GlcNAcB1-in particular are currently studied in detail by many research groups. As this aspect is outside the scope of this chapter, no details will be presented. In relation to glycoprotein glycans containing polysialyl elements, conformational studies on the polysaccharides of N. meningitidis B, {NeuSAc(a2-8)}, , and N. meningitidis C, {NeuSAc(a2-9)}, , are of interest [57 1-5751. Conformation and solution dynamics studies of the B-and C-polysaccharides, using NMR spectroscopy, showed an antiperiplanar orientation of H7 and H8 in the C-polysaccharide and a gauche orientation in the B-polysaccharide [571] . In a further NMR study on (NeuSAc(a2-8)}, it was found that both linkages in (NeuSAc(a2-8)}3 differed in conformation from each other and from the inner linkages of the polymer colominic acid. These conformational differences extend to both terminal disaccharides of oligosaccharides larger than (NeuSAc(a2-8)}5. It could be demonstrated that at least 5 residues are required before a linkage with a similar orientation to that of the internal a2,S-linkages of colominic acid is generated [572] . In this context, it is interesting to note that (Ne~SAc(a2-8))~o at the minimum is required to bind to B-polysaccharide specific antibodies, which means that the immunologically functional moiety of the decamer is formed by the inner 6 residues. Finally, in more recent studies the helical character of (NeuSAc(a2-8)}, in solution has been studied, and ordered helical structures [573] as well as an inherently flexible structure, containing a wide range of energetically favorable helices, one of which is an extended helix where n M 9 [574], has been proposed.",

An overview on the reactions involved, including catabolic enzymes, is shown in Fig. 13 . The reactions, subcellular site, regulation, pathobiochemical role and molecular genetics of the enzymes activating sialic acids with CTP and transferring them onto nascent glycoconjugate molecules have also been intensively studied in animal and bacterial cells and much progress has been made.

They impair the activity of the key regulatory enzyme UDP-Nacetylglucosamine-2'-epimerase. In the same tissue, 3-O-methyl-N-acetyl-~-glucosamine efficiently inhibits N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmannosamine kinases involved in NeuSAc formation [579] . Consequently, the incorporation of N-acetylhexosamines into sialic acids in human hepatoma cells was reduced. After intraperitoneal injection of N-propanoybhexosamines, N-propanoylneuraminic acid could be isolated from tissues at different relative amounts, showing that the enzymes for sialic acid biosynthesis and transfer can tolerate changes in the N-acetyl moiety of precursor acylhexosamines [580].

Furthermore, the enzyme requires the presence of a hydroxyl group at C8, since 8d-NeuSAc is inactive. This is in contrast to 4d-NeuSAc and 9d-NeuSAc. Substituents at C4, such as in NeuSAc4Me or Neu4,SAc2, are tolerated.

Both the H 0 6 group of the P-Gal residue and the N-acetyl group of the GlcNAc unit are required for the activity of a-2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6Gal I). The a-2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3Gal 111) requires the H03, H 0 4 and H 0 6 groups of terminal B-Gal, and some influence from the subterminal sugars was noticed. Structural variants of the Gal residue can also be recognized by rat liver Gal(B14)GlcNAc a-2,6-sialyltransferase.

            "text": "Little is known about inhibitors of sialyltransferases, although such compounds are very interesting for the modulation of sialylation, e.g. to study tumor biology and cancer therapy. Various sialic acids and their derivatives, as well as other synthetic or natural substances were tested as inhibitors (refs. [642,642a] , Table 15 ). The Ki values of periodatetreated UDP and CMP, resulting in two aldehyde groups from the ribose ring each, which inhibit CMP-Neu5Ac:lactosylceramide a-2,3-sialyltransferase in microsomes of embryonic chicken brain in an irreversible, competitive manner [643] , are also presented. While the natural 5'-CMP nucleotide is a potent inhibitor of rat liver and porcine submandibular gland sialyltransferases, the 3'-CMP isomer has no inhibitory effect. Strikingly, cytidine itself and its 2-thio-derivative also markedly inhibit the a-2,6-and a-2,3-sialyltransferases tested. Other substituents on cytidine both on the ribose and base moiety abolish this inhibitory effect. Oxidative opening of the ribose group of CMP significantly reduces the inhibitory potency of CMP on the liver and submandibulary gland enzymes, but yields a good inhibitor for the chicken brain sialyltransferase. The interesting compound 5-fluoro-2',3'-isopropylidene-5'-O-(4-N-acetyl-2,4-dideoxy-3,6,7,8-tetra-O-acetyl-1 -methoxycarbonyl-D-glycero-cr-D-galucto-octapyranosyl)uridine (KI-8 1 1 0), a CMP-Neu5Ac analogue, has been synthesized and inhibits the sialylation of cells in culture and pulmonary metastasis of mouse colon adenocarcinoma [648, 649] . Although this compound does not inhibit the pure sialyltransferases from rat liver and porcine submandibular gland, it seems to inhibit the translocation of CMP-NeuSAc through the Golgi membrane and thus sialylation of nascent glycoconjugates, as was observed with mouse and trout microsomes [642] as well as with Golgi vesicles from human liver and colorectal cancer cells [650] . As consequence of reduced sialylation, the growth of Sindbis viruses in cell culture was much hindered (M. Odenthal-Schnittler et al., unpublished observations).",

For example, the methyl glycosides of 6'-deoxy-and 6'-thio-N-acetyllactosamine, which inhibit rat liver a-2,6-sialyltransferase in the millimolar range, are shown in Table 15 . In all these cases, the inhibition does not follow pure Michaelis-Menten kinetics, but is of mixed competitivehon-competitive type. Natural sialyltransferase inhibitors have also been found, which are considered to play a role in the regulation of the synthesis of sialoglycoproteins and gangliosides. Whereas heparin and other polyanions are weak inhibitors, proteins from rat and calf brain have been isolated which inhibit a-2,6-sialyltransferases from ovine submandibular gland and rat liver by about 80% at a concentration of 20pgimol [641, 645] . Two proteins of molecular mass 14.8 and 22.4 kDa isolated from rat brain inhibit both CMP-Neu5Ac:lactosylceramide a-2,6sialyltransferase [646] and rat liver a-2,6-sialyltransferase [642].

            "text": "Many enzymatic and histochemical (see refs. [651, 652] and chapter 5 of Vol. 29a, \"Glycoproteins\") studies have shown that sialylation occurs in the trans-Golgi network [653] as a terminal glycosylation step after the transfer of CMP-sialic acid from the cytosol through the Golgi membrane by a specific translocator (see also Fig. 15  below) . This protein was shown to transfer both CMP-Neu5Ac and CMP-NeuSGc equally well [654] . A detailed study on the glycosylation including sialylation of oligosaccharides in rat liver Golgi preparations was reported in refs. [655, 656] . In rat liver hepatoma cells, the glycosylation of a-2,6-sialyltransferase is involved in the maturation of the enzyme to a higher molecular mass form [632] . The enzyme follows the secretory pathway as a membrane protein and is retained at a late Golgi stage. Due to rapid degradation in a post-Golgi compartment, the enzyme, exhibiting a half-life time of 3 h, is secreted from the cell in only small amounts. For the retention of the sialyltransferase in the trans-Golgi network, signals in the enzyme's polypeptide chain were suggested to be responsible for the specific binding to Golgi membranes. It was shown with mutant and chimeric a-2,6-sialyltransferase that the cytoplasmatic tail and signal anchor region alone are not sufficient for Golgi retention [657] . However, when two lysine residues were placed next to the signal anchor on the luminal side of the enzyme, more efficient Golgi retention was observed. This suggests that the signal anchor region is not sufficient for Golgi retention and that it can be replaced by any transmembrane region which allows correct spacing and folding of sequences flanking the membrane. So far, the acceptor specificity of nearly 20 eu-and prokaryotic sialyltransferases has been elucidated and 15 different cDNA clones of these enzymes have been obtained (Table 14 and references therein). This list demonstrates the rapid progress in this field and also includes the first cloning of mammalian polysialyltransferase (polysialyltransferase-1 from hamster ovary cells) [620] . The same group has recently published the molecular analysis of the biosynthetic pathway of the a-2,8-polysialic acid capsule by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B [658] .",

However, very few established functions have yet been allocated to NeuSGc. Our knowledge of this field is summarized in Table 16 . It shows that in addition to structural aspects, the presence of NeuSGc modulates the general functions of the main, precursor sialic acid, NeuSAc. This is best illustrated with sialidases, the action of which is suppressed by the presence of a N-glycolyl group in sialic acids. This may afford some protection for host cells from attack by pathogen-derived sialidases, since the removal of sialic acids facilitates the further degradation of cells by other glycosidases and proteases [245] . Neu5Gc may therefore effectively act against the virulence of certain infectious bacteria. It is also conceivable that Neu5Gc may mask subterminal galactose residues of oligosaccharide chains thus preventing their recognition and phagocytosis by macrophages more potently than does Neu5Ac 116631. Other cell recognition phenomena, such as binding of sialic acids to sialoadhesin of mouse macrophages [664] or to the enterotoxic E. coli strain K99, which infects young pigs [665] , is modulated by Neu5Gc.",

This fact, together with the solubility of the enzyme following tissue homogenization stimulated purification and characterization of the enzyme from porcine submandibular gland [680] and mouse liver [68 1,6821. The enzyme from both sources is a monomer with a molecular mass of 6SkDa. The CMP-NeuSAc hydroxylase was also studied in the gonads of the starfish Asterias rubens, which belongs to the phylogenetically oldest animals synthesizing NeuSGc [683] . It has many characteristics in common with the mammalian enzymes. All hydroxylases studied so far show high affinity for CMP-NeuSAc [660] , i.e. apparent KM values in the low micromolar range (e.g. 1.3 pM for the mouse liver enzyme [684] ). They require a number of cofactors for activity including molecular oxygen, reduced pyridine nucleotides, and, as was shown for the mammalian enzymes, cytochrome b5, and cytochrome b5-reductase. These form an electron transport chain resulting in the incorporation of one oxygen into the methyl residue of the N-acetyl group, as shown in Fig. 14. Some experimental evidence was presented [685] that at the beginning of this concerted action the binding of CMP-NeuSAc to the hydroxylase changes the conformation of the enzyme in a way leading to the recognition and binding of the enzyme by cytochrome b5 and the formation of a ternary complex. After the transfer of electrons from NAD(P)H to the enzyme through cytochrome b5, CMP-NeuSAc is converted to CMP-NeuSGc which was shown not to bind to the enzyme and is therefore released with concomitant dissociation of the ternary complex. The observation that the addition of iron salts can stimulate enzyme activity and iron-binding substances are potent inhibitors, together with electron-spin-resonance studies of the purified hydroxylase, strongly point to the presence of an iron-sulfur center in the active site, which is possibly of the Rieske type [686] . The CMP-NeuSAc hydroxylases from mouse liver [687] and pig submandibular gland [688] have both been cloned. The gene structures show high homology.",

The activity of CMP-NeuSAc hydroxylase and accordingly the concentration of CMP-Neu5Gc in the cytosol probably play the most important role in regulating the level of sialylation with Neu5Gc. This is assumed because neither the Golgi CMP-sialic acid antiporter nor the sialyltransferases exhibit a pronounced preference for CMP-Neu5Ac or CMP-NeuSGc (Fig. 15 ). The activity of the hydroxylase may thus be tuned so that the ratio of Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac required in the resulting glycoconjugates is generated in the form of CMP-glycosides in the cytosol. The multiplicity of functions and constitutive expression of the cytochrome b5 system, together with the lack of effect of any metabolites on the hydroxylase activity [68 13 , suggest that the rate of production of CMP-NeuSAc is regulated at the level of the expression of the monooxygenase. The tissue-specific and developmental factors affecting the production of this protein on the gene level as well as a possible influence of the oxygen pressure still remain to be elucidated. No experimental explanation has so far been obtained for the formation of NeuSGc in human tumors, which may be caused by the anomalous expression of a CMP-NeuSAc hydroxylase gene, which seems to be dormant or repressed in normal tissues. Significantly, in T-cell lymphomas of baboons the level of NeuSGc, as component of gangliosides, was much higher than in those from the corresponding normal tissues [691] . The fusion of human B lymphocytes with mouse myeloma cells leads to high expression of NeuSGc, showing activation of the enzymes involved in NeuSGc biosynthesis due to the somatic cell fusion process [692] . It was furthermore reported that the insertion of retroviruses into Chinese hamster ovary cells almost completely replaces NeuSAc by NeuSGc [693] .",

This modification is either at position 4 of the pyranose ring of both NeuSAc and NeuSGc, as was found in horse, donkey, guinea pig and echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), or in the glycerol side chain of sialic acids. In the latter case, the 0-acetyl group is most frequently located at C9, but it may be accompanied by acetylation at C8 and/or C7, leading to di-and tri-0-acetylated species. This side-chain 0-acetylation is very frequent in the animal kingdom and is also found in tissues and fluids of man. However, in the expression of 0-acetylated sialic acids ethnic differences do exist in colonic mucin of Sino-Japanese and non-Sino-Japanese races. 0-Acetylation was more frequent in the latter ethnic groups studied (British, Icelanders, South African blacks and Bahrainis) than in Chinese and Japanese. It is speculated that loss of 0-acetylation may be due to a single mutation of the gene regulating 0-acetylation and that this may be related to selection pressure resulting from differential enteric colonization by bacterial flora and from resulting infectious diseases [695] .",

We are only just beginning to understand these effects, which influence many biological and pathobiochemical systems, as listed in Table 17 . As with NeuSGc, 0-acetylation may influence the physicochemical properties of sialylated glycoconjugates, which is especially important on cell surfaces. Correspondingly, an increased protective effect of the mucin containing a large quantity of 0-acetylated sialic acids and lining the endothelia of human colon is discussed [245] . This protection against an aqueous environment containing a large quantity of different bacteria may be due firstly to the greater hydrophobicity imparted by the 0-acetyl groups and secondly to a greater resistance of 0-acetylated sialic acids to microbial sialidases when compared with NeuSAc.",

This effect may facilitate recycling of sialic acids released from glycoconjugates. 0-Acetyl groups have a further hindering effect on the binding by several proteins, as was observed with the hemagglutinins of influenza A and B viruses, which only bind to non-0-acetylated NeuSAc and Neu5Gc [699] , with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, where the attachment of 0-acetylated mouse erythrocytes was weaker than to non-0-acetylated cells [700] , and with sialoadhesin from mouse macrophages [664] .

From the results reported above, an 0-acetyltransferase specific for the 0-glycan of mucin in bovine submandibular glands could also be postulated.",

However, the linkage of Kdn to CMP by the cytidylyltransferase from the testis of rainbow trout has been reported [107, 122] . This enzyme can also activate Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc. A Golgi-membrane-bound Kdn-transferase from the ovaries of the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss has been characterized [545] . This enzyme terminates the growth of a-2,8-polysialyl chains in a series of actions of four glycosyltransferases involved in the glycosylation of ovary glycoproteins. Three of these transferases are sialyltransferases, the first transferring Neu5Gc to C6 of serine-or threonine-bound GalNAc, the second linking another Neu5Gc residue to C8 of this first Neu5Gc and the third enzyme being an a-2,8-polysialyltransferase for chain elongation, before termination of its growth by the 2,s-Kdn-transferase [545] .

While a 4-U-acetyl group completely hinders the action of these enzymes (with the exception of a slow release by viral sialidases [252] ), such ester groups at the sialic acid side chain appreciably hinder hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond of these sugars and their further breakdown by lyases. The existence of esterases acting on 0-acetylated sialic acids prior to sialidase is therefore a prerequisite or at least supports the rapid turnover of 0-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates. The possibility of the existence of such enzymes was raised by the observation that horse glycoproteins, which are heavily 4-U-acetylated, seem to have a normal turnover, and sialidase studied in horse liver cannot act on 4-U-acetylated sialic acids [742] . Consequently, the existence of such esterases in horse liver was assumed and two enzymes were found, one hydrolyzing only 9-U-acetyl groups and the other mainly 4-U-acetyl residues from sialic acids (ref. [266] , and unpublished work). Furthermore, sialate-9-U-acetylesterases (EC 3.1.1.53) have been isolated and characterized from influenza C virus [705, 743] , bovine brain [744] and rat liver [745, 746] . They also occur in human erythrocytes [747] as well as in enteric bacteria [748] . These enzymes specifically release 9-U-acetyl groups from free and glycosidically bound sialic acids. 9-U-Lactyl groups, U-acetyl groups of Neu5,7Ac2 and methyl-esterified carboxyl groups of sialic acid are not hydrolyzed. Although they also attack U-acetyl groups of non-physiological substances, e.g. naphthyl acetate [266, 749] , they belong to the few esterases which have been recognized to have a physiological function [266] . Amide groups including the synthetically added 9-N-acetyl moiety of 9NAc-Neu5Ac (Table 13 ) are resistant to the action of these esterases. However, the latter Neu5Ac derivative binds to influenza C virus hemagglutinin and it does this in a stable manner, as it cannot be removed by the viral esterase [750] . The staining of glycoconjugates containing U-acetylated sialic acids with influenza C virus and the problems involved due to esterase activity were discussed in sections 4 and 8.4.2.",

Tissue esterases may also participate in the recycling of sialoglycoconjugates, as the U-acetyl groups of the ganglioside GD3 in human melanoma cells turn over faster than the underlying sialic acids of this molecule [75 11 . It should be noted that the de-N-acetylated sialic acid (Table l) , as a component of GD3 ganglioside, can also occur in the same malignant cells [14] , as was shown by immunological means. Thus, the unstable neuraminic acid molecule can exist in nature, however, only in glycosidic linkage (section 1). The viral enzyme may be of pathophysiological significance and be involved in the binding to mucins and to endothelial cell surfaces prior to endocytosis of the virus particles [266, 728] . With regard to the epidemiology of viral infections, the viral esterase might contribute to the unmasking of new receptor sites to facilitate superinfection by type A and B influenza viruses [752] . Sialate esterase from human enteric bacteria acts on U-acetylated sialic acids of colon mucin and thus facilitates the further degradation of the mucin barrier by bacterial sialidase and other glycosidases [748] .",

Alternatively, 5-N-acetyl- [285] acts as a specific and highly sensitive, fluorescent esterase substrate (see sections 5.3.2 and 6.2). With the corresponding 7,8,9-tri-U-acetylated derivative it was shown that influenza C virus esterase can remove all three U-acetyl groups [469] . Since this esterase acts only on the U-acetyl residue at C9, de-0-acetylation of the whole sialic acid side chain can occur only after migration of the other U-acetyl groups to the primary alcohol group at C9. These experiments provide further evidence for the existence of the cascade of alternative enzymatic de-0-acetylation and non-enzymatic 0-acetyl migration proposed earlier (refs. [5, 7, 33] , and sections 2 and 5.3.5).",

Sialidase, as well as its substrate, is common in metazoan animals of the deuterostomate lineage from echinoderms to mammals [33, 244, 246, 753] . Diverse viruses and microorganisms, such as fungi, protozoa and bacteria also produce sialidases [33, 244, 246, , although they mostly lack sialic acids. The most recent review on the biochemistry and function of the large sialidase family discusses great variety in cellular location, molecular mass and substrate specificity [246] .

In the majority of cases, the a-2,3-linkage is cleaved most rapidly [244, 246, . Due to steric hindrance the side-positioned (branched) terminal Neu5Ac as in GM 1, however, is resistant to the action of most sialidases with the exception of the Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase. The sialidases from C. perfingens and V cholerae cleave the glycosidic bond of their substrates between C2 of Neu5Ac and the glycosidic oxygen, as demonstrated by release experiments carried out in H2[I80] buffer solutions and monitoring by GLC [758] . Sialic acids are released in the a-anomeric form after which they slowly mutarotate to the more stable b-form (see section 5.3.5). Although Neu2en5Ac is a competitive inhibitor for most members of this sialidase group, it has not been detected to be an intermediate of enzyme reaction, as was the case for some viral sialidases (see below).",

Thus, this sialidase can \"synthesize its own inhibitor\". During the reaction, the chair conformation of NeuSAc is distorted to the boat conformation by the concerted action of mainly aspartate, arginine, glutamate and tyrosine residues of the active center. The aspartate serves as proton donor for the release of the glycosidic partner of sialic acid. After the formation of the oxocarbonium intermediate, the addition of a hydroxyl group leads to the formation of a-NeuSAc, or, in a side reaction by deprotonation, to Neu2enSAc. The site of enzyme catalysis was shown by X-ray crystallographic studies of the inhibitor-influenza A NPsialidase complex [ 76 I] .",

The enzyme has the shape of a six-bladed propeller, each blade consisting of four-stranded antiparallel fi-sheets (Fig. 17) . The axis of this propeller passes through the active site. The Asp-boxes are located at topologically equivalent positions on the outside of the blades which is not in favor of a role of these sequence motifs in enzyme catalysis. Cocrystallization of the enzyme with the inhibitor Neu2enSAc enabled the identification of the amino acids involved in sialic acid binding and catalysis. Accordingly, the active site consists of an arginine triad, a hydrophobic pocket and key tyrosine and glutamic acid residues. The interaction of these residues with different parts of the NeuSAc molecule is shown in Fig. 18 for three bacterial sialidases. Identical amino acids are assumed to be involved in catalysis by the low-molecular-mass sialidase from C. perfringens, as was shown by the finding of conserved amino acids at positions identical or similar to the S. typhimurium enzyme, site-directed mutagenesis and hydropathy studies of the amino acid sequence [Kleineidam et al., unpublished] .

This may have occurred during infections by the uptake of DNA from decomposed host cells or during the life of microorganisms in intestine. It is therefore necessary to investigate the sialidase genes from lower animals, particularly of echinodermata, which are considered to be the \"inventors\" of both the sialidase and sialic acids.

This has been exploited, by choosing suitable conditions and bacterial or viral sialidases, for the a-2,3-or a-2,6-sialylation of oligosaccharides as final step in the course of chemical synthesis (see section 6.3). During the last years, several sialidases have been discovered in some protozoa which behave like normal sialidases if only water is present, but preferably transfer sialyl residues from one glycan chain to the terminal galactose of another non-sialylated oligosaccharide or glycoconjugate forming a-2,3-linkages. The first hint for the existence of an unusual sialic acid transfer reaction was given in 1983, when sialic acids (Neu5Ac and NeuSGc) were detected in Trypanosoma cruzi [662, 801] , which were found not to be synthesized by the parasites themselves. Since the molar ratio of these trypanosomal sialic acids corresponded to that of the incubation medium, their acquisition from this source, or in the case of an infection, from the host glycoconjugates, was assumed. Furthermore, an involvement of the sialidase activity found in these trypanosomes [802] and later localized on their cell surface, was suspected. These observations finally led to the discovery of enzymes called \"trans-sialidases\", first in the American species 1: cruzi [803-8051 and later in the African species T. brucei [755] and I: congolense [806] . A closer investigation revealed the presence of this enzyme in the whole 1: brucei group, i.e. several strains of 7: brucei brucei, T. brucei rhodesiense and I: brucei gambiense [806] . It also occurs in Endotrypanum promastigotes, an intraerythrocytic flagellate distantly related to trypanosomes [807] . In contrast, many other members of the kinetoplastida lack both sialidase and trans-sialidase activities, or express only sialidase, such as 1: uiuax [808] and T. rangeli [809] . This rapidly expanding field has been reviewed in refs. [246, 810] . It is possible to discriminate between morphologically indistinguishable trypanosomatids by measurement of trans-sialidase and sialidase activities [S 1 11. Furthermore, the occurrence of sialic acids on major cell-surface epitopes correlates with the expression of transsialidase [812] .",

While for the 7: cruzi enzyme only a-2,3-but not a-2,6-linked sialic acids are donors in the transfer reaction [550] , the 7: brucei trans-sialidase can also transfer a-2,6-linked sialic acids from sialyllactose to other glycans, however at an eight times lower rate than from sialyl(a2-3)lactose [755] . While both Neu5Ac and NeuSGc are transferred equally well, Neu5,9Ac2 from the corresponding sialyllactose derivative serves as sialyl donor only at a much reduced rate [696] . This may be the reason why N'dama cattle exhibiting a high degree of 0-acetylation of erythrocyte sialic acids are more trypanotolerant than Zebu cattle, whose erythrocyte sialic acids are much less 0-acetylated [703] . Only P-galactose residues of a variety of oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates are acceptors of these transferases. Sialyl(a2-3)lactose is the best donor for the trans-sialidase from 7: brucei and lactose the best acceptor when compared with serum glycoproteins, mucins and gangliosides [755] . MUNeu5Ac also serves as a sialyl donor. A novel substrate for the assay of trans-sialidase activities is MUB-D-galactopyranoside as sialic acid acceptor which was tested with the T brucei enzyme [806] . The main advantage of this accurate and sensitive assay is the avoidance of radioactive lactose as substrate.",

[776] , the T cruzi trans-sialidase consists of an N-terminal half, containing the enzymatic function and a C-terminal portion, composed mainly of a tandem series of twelve amino acid repeats. Four Asp-boxes exist within the N-terminus of the enzyme. However, only three of these conserved motifs occur in positions of the amino acid sequence similar to those found in bacterial sialidases, while the distance between the third and the fourth box is much larger in the parasite enzyme than in the bacterial proteins. It may be assumed that this extended sequence together with some other structural features is a domain functioning in the trans-sialidase mechanism [768,8 151 . The carboxy-terminal repetitive motif is most probably not involved in catalytic activity [8 15 ,8201 and a recombinant T cruzi trans-sialidase lacking the amino acid repeats was shown to retain the enzymatic activity [821] . Remarkably, the American parasite 7: rangeli secretes a conventional sialidase [809] lacking transsialidase activity [822], the primary structure of which is related (70% identity of the amino acid sequences) to that of the trans-sialidase of T cruzi [777] . Sequences encoding the tandemly repeated motif characteristic of the members of the trans-sialidase family were not detected in the T rangeli genomic DNA. 7: cruzi trans-sialidase first named SAPA (\"Shed-Acute-Phase-Antigen\") and found in human serum in Chagas disease, is also unique from an immunological aspect, since it contains two immunologically distinct domains and seems to be a naturally chimeric protein having functionally independent enzymatic and antigenic domains [823] . (It is thus reminiscent of c! cholerae sialidase which consists of a catalytic domain and a non-catalytic sequence similar to those of legume lectins [768, 791] .)",

It is well known that sialidases are involved in the breakdown of sialoglycoconjugates, which may be of physiological or pathological significance. These enzymes are physiologically important in the lysosomes, their main localization in animal cells, where they release sialic acids from glycoconjugates, thus initiating the degradation of these molecules by other glycosidases or proteases [5, 8, 33, 2441 . The significance of mammalian sialidases is indicated by diseases, called sialidosis [827] . In these genetic disorders, sialidase activity is reduced or lacking, resulting in reduced turnover of sialylated glycoconjugates, excretion of sialo-oligosaccharides in the urine as well as mental and physical impairments (see below).",

This is easily understandable, since sialic acids are not only structural but also functional constituents of many biologically active molecules of the cell, for example receptors, ion channels and growth-regulating molecules (refs. [246, 660] and section 10). Sialidases may regulate the functional activity of these and other molecules. Plasmamembrane-bound sialidase for instance is involved in the degradation of cell membrane gangliosides, which may not only represent a catabolic function, but also a regulative effect on the biological functioning of these molecules [828] . A striking example of such a role is the myelin-associated sialidase of rat oligodendroglial cells which was found to adhere to immobilized GMl and to be inhibited by this ganglioside [829] . This interaction can also be inhibited by the sialidase inhibitor Neu2enSAc. It is concluded from these experiments that the sialidase-GM1 interaction plays a role in the formation and stabilization of the multilamellar structure of the myelin sheath.",

In 7: brucei, sialylation only occurs in the insect stage, where sialic acids are probably derived from mammalian blood sucked in by the tsetse fly [806] . In contrast, in T cruzi sialic acid is acquired by the parasite not in the insect (triatomine bugs) stage, but only during its life in the mammalian host. Since sialylation may be of advantage to the trypanosomes, it is hypothesized that the dense, charged glycocalix formed by sialylation of 7: brucei may protect 7: brucei from the attack of proteases, glycosidases, antibodies or complement from the fly's digestive tract or from the ingested blood meal [806] . It is also conceivable that the parasites require sialic acids for maturation and adhesion to the fly's salivary glands before transfer to the mammalian hosts. Furthermore, after infection, sialylation may be of benefit for the survival of the parasites in the primary infection site (\"chancre\") of the host's skin, before the non-sialylated variable surface antigenic glycoproteins (VSG) are expressed. These antigens then represent another potential site for the immunological protection of the parasites when sialic acids are no longer available.",

The role of sialic acid in the resistance of 7: cruzi trypomastigotes to complement has clearly been shown [833] . Other experiments demonstrated that the acquisition of sialic acids increases the infectivity of 7: cruzi and is involved in invasion of host cells by these parasites [823,83 1,8341 , and accordingly the action of sialidase reduces their virulence. In mice the virulence-promoting activity of trans-sialidase was achieved with tiny doses of 1-2 pg enzymelkg animal [835] . (An increase of pathogenicity, i.e. evasion of host defence systems, is also achieved by sialylation of some pathogenic bacteria, such as group B Streptococcus [836] and Neisseria gonorrhea [837] (see also Table 3 and sections 3 and 10.2). Correspondingly, monoclonal antibodies against the Ssp-3 epitope, the target of trans-sialidase activity and required for invasion after sialylation inhibit infection of the host cell [823, 838] .

It is likely that they hydrolyze sialic acids from host glycoconjugates for nutritional purposes as do bacteria (see below). It is, however, also possible that these trypanosomes demask recognition sites on host cells, e.g. subterminal galactose residues, for their attachment mediated by lectins or other receptors on the parasite's surface. This hypothesis clearly warrants further investigation. Infection of host cells by T. cruzi parasites is a complicated mechanism which is not yet fully understood. However, sialylation of both cell types seems to be necessary for this process. For the attachment and penetration of 7: cruzi into host cells the latter must be sialylated, as was shown with CHO cell mutants expressing no or varying amounts of sialic acids. O-Linked sialylated glycans of host cells were shown to be particularly important for infection [838] . Various trypanosomal surface glycoproteins are considered to be involved in adhesion, i.e. the developmentally regulated MTS-gp82 [839] , a small mucin-like sialoglycoprotein [840] , or enzymatically inactive members of the (trans-)sialidase family, which may be capable of binding sialic acid without cleaving it, and in this way may function as mammalian-stage-specific surface receptors [ 84 I] . On the parasite surface, the relative balance between exposed sialic acid and galactoselN-acetylgalactosamine residues may determine the parasite's capacity to invade host cells including macrophages [842] . A stage-specific 82 kDa adhesion molecule of 7: cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes may play a role in host cell invasion [843] .",

The crucial role of sialic acid in host-cell-parasite interaction and the reversible sialylation of cell surface molecules mediated by sialidase and trans-sialidase activities, which in some respects resembles the infection of mammalian cells by influenza viruses, has also been pointed out in other studies [826, 847] .",

After the loss of sialic acids, host cell membrane glycoconjugates are more vulnerable to the action of other glycosidases and proteases secreted by bacteria, since the presence of terminal sialic acids on glycoconjugates is known to hinder the action of these enzymes [5] .

While one strain expressed sialidase, the activity of this enzyme was deleted in the other group. At the beginning of the culture, both strains grew equally well, however, after 48 to 72 h, the sialidase-producing strain was enriched. The latter bacteria grew more rapidly than those lacking sialidase, because after the consumption of glucose some 16 to 24h after infection, other carbon sources, including liberated sialic acid, were required for further bacterial growth. This experiment supports the assumption that sialidase may facilitate spreading and thus virulence of bacteria in infected tissues. Similar conclusions were drawn from studies on arteritis caused by Evysipelothrix rhusiopathiae [850] , in which a close correlation between bacterial invasion, desialylation and cell infiltration in the common iliac artery was observed.",

Cholera toxin subsequently binds to this ganglioside and is taken up by intestinal cells, which are stimulated to secrete cell fluid required for growth of the vibrions in the intestinal lumen.

            "text": "A survey of sialidase inhibitors was given earlier [5, 33, 865] and some recent inhibitors of higher efficiency ( K , < 10\"' M) are listed in Table 19 . Neu2enSAc is a competitive inhibitor which is still widely used, since it inhibits most viral, bacterial and mammalian sialidases with a Ki of around 5pM. This substance is therefore very useful to prove the specificity of sialidase action when studying the role of sialic acids in biological experiments. The replacement of the N-acetyl moiety in Neu2en5Ac by an N-trifluoroacetyl residue leads to an about 2-fold better inhibitor of K cholerue sialidase with a K , of 1.3-1.8 x 10-6M [389, 866] . In the case of 9d-NeuSAc a Ki of 1 x M was measured [869] . Using K cholerue sialidase, it was shown, with various Neu2enSAc derivatives structurally varied at C4, that the highest inhibitory effect was obtained with compounds having an axial hydroxyl residue, as in the parent substance Neu2enSAc [430] , whereas the 4epi-and 4d-derivatives were less inhibitory. These studies also revealed that 4amino-Neu2enSAc inhibits K cholerue sialidase only slightly, which is in contrast to influenza virus sialidases. The transition-state analogue 4d-Neu2enSAc inhibits influenza virus sialidase with a K , of 8 x Most interest is currently being focussed on the inhibition of viral sialidases, since their role in the infection mechanism has long been known. The fact that Neu2enSAc is a transition-state analogue for the sialosyl residue during the viral enzyme reaction described in section 9.2.1 [60, 320] , served as a point of reference in the design of new inhibitors. The observation that the 4-0-acetyl group in the ring of Neu4,5Ac2 M) [441] . a For the abbreviation of natural and synthetic sialic acids see Tables 1 and 13 , respectively w P L n completely hinders the action of mammalian and bacterial sialidases [5, 33] but allows slow hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond by viral enzymes [252, 876] , as well as the finding by X-ray crystallography studies that in the active center of viral sialidases only acidic amino acids (i.e. aspartic acid) interact with H 0 4 of sialic acid, led to the synthesis of much more potent inhibitors of influenza viruses. These are 4amino-Neu2enSAc and 4guanidino-Neu2enSAc [428, 429, 867, 868, 877] , which exhibit K, values in the nanomolar range, corresponding to 2 4 orders of magnitude lower than Neu2enSAc. The guanidino derivative inhibits more effectively than the amino compound. 4-Guanidino-Neu2enSAc was shown to inhibit influenza virus A sialidase in a slow-binding fashion, and a Ki value of 3 x lo-'' M was observed for the tightly bound form under steady-state conditions [878] . This strong binding to viral sialidases and not to those from bacteria or mammals, is due to the existence of a pocket in the binding site of viral sialidases near to the H 0 4 group of sialic acid [867, 879, 880] . This pocket is considered to be the reason why Neu4,5Ac2 [252] and NeuSAc4Me [407] can be released by viral sialidase, but not by the bacterial enzyme. Since the other sialidases do not seem to have this pocket (for bacterial sialidases see refs. [790, 881] ) and are therefore inhibited to a much lesser extent, the new Neu2enSAc derivatives appear suitable for the prophylaxis and/or therapy of influenza A and B virus infections [867] . It has been shown for 4guanidino-Neu2enSAc that it inhibits the growth of a wide range of influenza A and B viruses in in vitro systems, including human respiratory epithelium, at lower concentrations than classical inhibitors of virus replication such as amantadine or ribavirin [868, . The same effect was observed in mice and ferrets when the new compounds were administered as a nasal spray [867, 880, 882] , thus raising hopes that these non-toxic substances can be used therapeutically during epidemics of influenza in man. These viral sialidase inhibitors are an excellent example of how drugs may be designed on the basis of a crystal structure of a target protein and on other biochemical parameters [867] . Potent inhibitors of bacterial sialidases or trypanosomal trans-sialidases are also desirable as pharmaceuticals to assist the therapy of inflammatory diseases caused by these microorganisms. Some natural substances exist which inhibit viral sialidases in the 10 pM range, such as siastatin A and B and panosialin [865] as well as flavonoids [875] (Table 19 ). Two epimers of siastatin B, 3-epi-siastatin B and 3,4-diepi-siastatin B, have been synthesized which are good inhibitors of sialidases from various influenza virus strains, as well as from Sendai and Newcastle disease viruses [874] . They effectively inhibit the growth of these viruses in cell cultures. Sialidases from Streptococcus sp. and C. perfringens are inhibited to an extent comparable to Neu2en5Ac by the N-( 1,2-dihydroxypropyl) derivative of siastatin B and its 4-deoxy analogue [873] . Isoscutellarein (5,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyilavone) isolated from the leafs of Scutellaria baicalensis is a good inhibitor of influenza virus sialidases (K, = 4 x M). It is not toxic to mice and inhibits replication of influenza viruses in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells. It was shown to be a better inhibitor than amantadine. The 8-methoxy derivative of isoscutellarein is also a potent inhibitor [885] .",

Various sialyl(a2-6)galactosides in which one of the hydrogen atoms at C6 of Gal has been replaced by a methyl group, yielding R and S isomers, and in some of which thioglycosidic bonds occur, act on both viral and bacterial sialidases [886] . Although their inhibition constants are only in the millimolar range, these compounds are expected to have important implications in the rational design of sialidase inhibitors. The finding that these glycosides are the first common inhibitors of both hemagglutinin and sialidase of influenza viruses may prove to be of great advantage. The o-(difluoromethy1)phenyLglycoside of a-Neu5Ac irreversibly inhibits C. perfingens sialidase [887] . This mechanism-based inhibitor acts by a fluoromethylene-quinone formed spontaneously from the liberated difluoromethylphenol. Analogues of free NeuSAc, such as H 0 4 epimers of 6-amino-6-deoxy-sialic acid are competitive inhibitors of medium potency for both viral and bacterial sialidases [438] . 3F-Neu5Ac strongly and competitively inhibits bacterial, viral and mouse spleen sialidases [442] . Other strategies for the production of sialidase inhibitors are the Neu5Ac isomer with a 6-acetylamino group occurring in the furanose ring form, which could be interpreted as a 6-acetylamino derivative of Kdn or 4epi-Kdn [888] . Promising inhibitors also represent 4azido-NeuSAc-, 4amino-Neu5Ac-and 4NAc-NeuSAc-containing sialosides and thiosialosides [889] .",

Such studies are based on the crystal structure of an influenza virus N9-sialidase (antigen)-NC4 1 (antibody) complex, showing the direct contact of four amino acid residues on the antibody binding surface with the active-site loop 368-370 of the antigen [890] . Correspondingly, a constrained cyclic peptide composed of 5 amino acids was synthesized, which mimics the receptor-bound conformation of these amino acids and inhibits the sialidase with a Ki of 0.1 mM. Although this is about 3 orders of magnitude less than the parent protein, because the antibody forms contacts with about 17 amino acid residues of the antigen sialidase, it nevertheless opens a possible new approach for the design of more potent inhibitors of this important viral enzyme.",

One potential hope is the availability of antibodies, mentioned in sections 9.2.3 and 9.2.4.1. There it was also outlined that classical sialidase inhibitors like Neu2en5Ac and N-(4-nitrophenyl)oxamic acid are not effective on the trans-sialidases studied. A nonimmunological, non-competitive inhibitor of T cruzi sialidase activity, named cruzin, was first found in blood plasma from patients with Chagas' disease and later identified as high density lipoprotein (HDL) [834, 891] . This lipoprotein does not inhibit sialidases from 7: rungeli, various bacteria and influenza viruses. Remarkably, in high concentrations it enhances infection of culture cells by 1: cruzi trypomastigotes, while K cholerue sialidase reduces it, which points to the significance of sialylated structures on the parasites during infection. All these effects could be explained by the fact that HDL is not an inhibitor of 7: cruzi sialidase, but as a glycoprotein provided sialic acids for the trans-sialidase action of this enzyme, thus mimicking an inhibition of enzymatic sialic acid release in the test system used [8 151.",

This reaction and the occurrence of the soluble enzyme in both bacteria and higher animals as well as the influence of sialic acid substituents and enzyme inhibitors has been reviewed [5, 8, 33] . The biological role of this lyase in bacteria is believed to be nutritive, by splitting the sialic acid 9-carbon chain as prerequisite for further consumption in the energy-producing metabolism. In animals, the main function of the cytosolic enzyme seems to be in the degradation of sialic acids in order to regulate sialic acid metabolism by prevention of recycling of this sugar.",

The relative cleavage rates for NeuSAc, NeuSGc and Neu5,9Ac2 are loo%, 70% and 33%, respectively. Neu4,SAq and Neu2enSAc are inactive. An investigation into the kinetic behavior of various epi-and deoxy-analogues of NeuSAc with the lyase from C. perfringens revealed that modifications at C8 and C4 strongly reduce cleavage rates and affinity of the substrates to the enzyme, or are even inhibitory [409, 892, 893] . 4Epi-and 4d-NeuSAc were most inhibitory, with Ki values in the millimolar range. Computer-assisted drawings of these sialic acids (CPK models) indicate that the region most important for the binding of sialic acids to the enzyme is an equatorial zone stretching from C8 via the ring oxygen atom to C4 of the monosaccharide. The substituents at CS and C9 may be varied to a greater extent without significantly disturbing enzyme action. The structural features of sialic acid required for the interaction with the lyase [892] are depicted in Fig. 19 .",

Several reviews on the biological aspects of sialic acid biochemistry have appeared [5,8,245,660,663,690,853,90&909] . From these articles it is clear that there are general functions of sialic acids resulting from their physico-chemical properties such as electronegativity, hydrophilicity and relatively large size, coupled with their exposed position on cells and secreted macromolecules. However, there is a growing number of examples where sialic acids exert specific functions, mostly in molecular and cellular adhesion phenomena. The influence of natural and artificial modifications of the structure of Neu5Ac on enzymatic and some biological phenomena has been mentioned at relevant places throughout this article, showing that the configuration of NeuSAc and related molecules is of great importance for the metabolism and biology of these monosaccharides, including those of the whole glycoconjugate molecules, cells and tissues, to which sialic acids are bound.",

            "text": "Firstly, due to their high acidity (pK value around pH 2), sialic acids are fully dissociated under physiological conditions and act as anions for the binding of inorganic and organic cations, e.g. on cell surfaces, thus facilitating the cellular uptake of substances with physiological or pharmacological significance. Cell aggregation may be prevented by the repulsive effects of the negatively charged sialic acids, as was observed for example when studying the adhesion of cultured cells to their substratum [910] . These cells adhered better to a layer of desialylated gangliosides than to the native, negatively charged, species, or after desialylation of the cells. The prevention of erythrocyte aggregation by surface sialic acids is a further, excellent example of their repulsive effect [911, 912] . After the removal of sialic acids by sialidase, erythrocytes were found to aggregate readily, either without the influence of other compounds or under the influence of immunoglobulins and fibrinogen, respectively. Correspondingly, erythrocytes which are undersialylated in diabetes, as was analyzed with their glycophorin components, tend to increase aggregation and adhesion to blood vessel walls. This may be of importance in the development of vascular disease during diabetes [913] . The high degree of sialylation existing in the epithelial sialomucin \"episialin\", which is expressed not only on several secretory epithelial cell types but also in many carcinoma cell lines, is also believed to have antiadhesion function. This effect may facilitate metastasis of tumor cells [914] . Such a role can also be attributed to the sialic acids found on the surface of Streptococci of the serological group B. In contrast to the wild-type strain, an asialo mutant obtained by the transposon method showed stronger cell adherence, probably due to the more hydrophobic surface resulting from the lack of sialic acid [915] .",

These glycoconjugates are localized in clusters on neuronal and especially synaptic membranes in the vicinity of a membrane-bound calcium pump, thus facilitating the supply of these ions for neuronal cells. These calcium-ganglioside interactions may modulate neuronal functions, not only for the short-term process of synaptic transmission of information, but also for long-term events of neuronal adaptations including storage of information. The highly charged anionic sialic acid residues, a-2,3and a-2,6glycosidically bound to the trabecular meshwork of the human eye, are considered to be involved in the regulation of the aqueous outflow and the control of intraocular pressure [917] .",

This is, indeed, a very large field and we still are only beginning to understand the influences of glycoconjugate conformations in cell biology. To obtain such information on individual molecules existing on living cells is particularly difficult to obtain with the techniques available. However, with a-dodecyl-Neu5Ac anchored to the surface of a phospholipidbased membrane fragment, it was shown by 'H and 13C NMR studies that the sialic acid pyranose ring is extended into the aqueous phase with the carboxyl group remaining close to the membrane surface, where it may interact with a hydrogen acceptor [918] .

            "text": "The anti-proteolytic effect, long known [906] to be exerted by glycan chains on glycoproteins in general and sialic acids in particular, should also be mentioned here. This may be due to conformational changes mediated by sialic acids, to their negative charge, or to mere shielding of e.g. peptide bonds from proteases by the bulky carbohydrate moiety. The high grade of sialylation of lysosomal cell membranes [920] may be a protective barrier against proteases in this cellular compartment. Glycosylation of influenza virus hemagglutinin governs hydrolysis of certain peptide bonds by host proteases in order to enhance the virulence of these viruses [863, 921] . It is suggested that the removal of sialic acid from the carbohydrate moiety of the hemagglutinin of influenza B virus by sialidase is essential for the cleavage of this glycoprotein by cellular protease [922] . Mucins, which are highly glycosylated and often heavily sialylated [5, 13, 659, 906] are excellent anti-proteolytic substances of high viscosity, protecting endothelia particularly in the intestine or respiratory tract from the attack by proteases and pathogenic substances [5, 8, 245, 660, 853] . The high viscosity of mucins is due, to an extent, to their sialic acid and often also sulfate content, or, in lower animals, to the presence of other anionic components such as uronic acids, sulfate or phosphate residues [5, 853, 906, 923] . This property enables mucins to act as very efficient biological lubricants, thus for example facilitating the transport of foodstuffs through the intestine, assisting in the movement of the eye bulbus, facilitating the mechanical processes of reproduction, or serving as protection for fish and many lower animals, the body surfaces of which must be lubricated for movement in aqueous or muddy environments. The structure, biosynthesis and molecular biology of mucins expressing cell-and tissue specificity have been reviewed [722, 924] .",

This may be the reason why so many microorganisms such as trypanosomes (see section 9.2.4. l), bacteria (see below) and even pathogenic fungi [92&928] also developed mechanisms to sialylate cell surface components. Remarkably, in the fungi Sporothrix schenkii [926] and Fonsecaea pedrosi [928] , both of which are pathogenic to man, NeuSAc and NeuSGc were found.

These monosaccharides, after their exposure by sialidase or reduced sialyltransferase activity, interact with a variety of galactose-specific receptors and are thus involved in many physiological and pathological events (for reviews see refs. [5,8,663,925,93&934] ). The galactose-specific lectin of animals was found to be a phylogenetically very old protein, with homologues occurring in organisms ranging from the sponge Geodia cydonium to man [935, 936] . One of the best known galactose-specific receptors is the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor, which was the first well-characterized animal lectin [933, 937] . The properties, molecular biology and biosynthesis of this Ca2+-dependent receptor have been intensively studied (e.g.",

However, this lectin also mediates the hepatic binding and uptake of hepatitis B virus particles by the same mechanism [939] . This clearance of asialoglycoconjugates is also a problem during the therapeutic administration of recombinant glycoproteins, including those with hormonal or enzymatic activity, or the follicle-stimulating hormone isolated from urine [94&945]. Only the fully sialylated glycoproteins exhibit a long life in serum and thus extended biological activity, in contrast to those possessing terminal mannose or galactose residues.

It was shown in these studies that asialo-erythropoietin binds better to the hormone receptor than the sialylated form. Deglycosylated human lutropin and chorionic gonadotropin also bind better to the receptors than the native form, but their hormonal activities, such as CAMP formation and steroidogenesis are lost [947] . The presence of sialic acid residues is a functional requirement of the hormone molecules and may modulate the efficiency of signal transduction. It was shown in these studies that a sialic acid residue from a chorionic gonadotropin glycan either binds to the hormone receptor directly or to a neighboring lectin-like molecule. This interaction is essential for signal transduction mediated by the hormone. A comparable receptor which is responsible for the sequestration of sialic-acid-depleted blood cells, such as erythrocytes [948] , lymphocytes [949] and thrombocytes [43] exists on the surface of liver and spleen macrophages, and also on the peritoneal phagocytes of some animals [925,950,95 I] . This receptor was isolated from rat peritoneal macrophages [952] . It mediates binding of desialylated blood cells via demasked galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine residues by macrophages and requires Ca2+ for this function. Immunoglobulin or complement factors do not influence this process. Although sialidase-treated erythrocytes and thrombocytes are phagocytozed after adhesion [43, 948] , lymphocytes are released from the macrophages within 24 h after binding [949] , probably due to the resynthesis of their sialic acid moieties. The binding of the three cell types to phagocytes is shown in Fig. 22 .",

In neonatal rat liver cell cultures, the asialoglycoprotein receptor has been implicated in the ingestion by healthy hepatocytes of neighboring cells undergoing apoptosis [957] . After desialylation of rooster sperm glycocalyx, the fertility of the spermatozoa was reduced due to an increased rate of sequestration in the hen's reproductive tract when compared with untreated cells [958] . This effect is believed to be due to demasking of antigenic or other recognition sites on the spermatozoa. However, treatment of human motile spermatozoa with sialidase results in better attachment of these cells to the zona pellucida of oocytes [959] . It is concluded from this observation that the release of sialic acid from the sperm plasma membrane could be one of the capacitation events necessary for unmasking certain sperm surface antigens or carbohydrate ligands implicated in zona pellucida recognition. The surface of human spermatozoa is highly sialylated, containing predominantly Neu5Ac(a2-6)Gal/GalNAcglycoconjugate sequences [959, 960] .

This resistance is lost in subcultures of the bacteria, but can be acquired again in the host. It is also absent in mutants lacking the necessary lipopolysaccharides. However, after infection with such Gonococci, variants appeared in the patient again expressing the acceptor for sialic acids, which shows a fascinating capability of the bacteria to adapt to the life in the host [970] . Closer investigation has revealed that sialic acids also mask porin epitopes on the Gonococci, which results in the reduction of the binding and bactericidal activity of antibodies recognizing this peptide moiety [972] .

Loss of sialic acids, which may occur by exogenous sialidases from infections by microorganisms and viruses (see section 9.2.4), can thus lead to autoimmune diseases. One example is glomerulonephritis of human kidney, probably resulting from streptococcal infections. We are only at the beginning to understand such pathobiochemical mechanisms. It was also shown that cultured epithelial cells from guinea pig after treatment with bacterial sialidase bind more IgM than the controls [795, 975] . These cells and those from lung epithelium taken from influenza-virus-infected animals were found to be hyposialylated. In serum, the level of IgG autoantibodies binding to the sialidase-treated cells increased [975] . It is assumed that these autoantibodies participate in cellular disfunctions and modify bronchoreactivity occurring during the infection of the respiratory tract. Asthma and chronic pulmonary disease may be the consequence of such desialylation. In these processes, the parasympathetic tone of the airways and the affinity of muscarinic agonists is impaired and the interaction of acetylcholine and histamine with their receptors also seems to be disturbed [795, 976] .",

Such sialic-acid-recognizing proteins or lectins from microorganisms, plants and invertebrates (mainly snails, scorpions and crabs) have been summarized in Tables 20 and 21 , and have been discussed elsewhere in this series. They show more or less specific binding to different sialic acids or even specific sialic acid linkages and oligosaccharide sequences, as reviewed [709] . A careful investigation of the binding determinants of the sialic-acid-specific lectin from e.g. the slug L i m a jauus has revealed that the a-anomer, the N-acetyl group, and an intact side chain of sialic acid are necessary for high affinity interaction. An axial position of the hydroxyl group at C4, hydroxylation of the N-acetyl group or substitution by a formyl residue, as well as 9-0-acetylation or periodate cleavage of the glycerol chain of NeuSAc considerably reduced binding to the lectin [224] . Since these organisms do not express sialic acids themselves, it is unlikely that these lectins play a role as sialic-acid-binding proteins in cell recognition. However, they may be involved in defence against sialic-acid-containing microorganisms and animals. Some of the sialic-acid-binding lectins have proved to be useful tools in the analysis and histochemistry of glycoconjugates. Most frequently used are the agglutinins from wheat germ (WGA), LimafIauus (LFA), Sambucus nigra (SNA) and Maackia amurensis (MAA) (see section 4). Initial insight into the putative sialic-acidbinding sites of these unique lectins can be gained from a comparison of the primary structure of MAA with other plant lectins [lOOl] . A conserved asparagine residue was found to be exchanged by aspartate (Asp-135), which is proposed to be involved in the interaction between MAA and sialo-oligosaccharides.",

The use of sialic acid analogues modified in the glycerol side chain and in the N-acetyl and in the carboxyl groups of NeuSAc, gave support to these models and revealed that the hydroxyl group at C9 does not interact with the hemagglutinin [394] . The N-acetyl moiety is critical for the interaction of sialic acids via hydrophobic bonds. These studies were extended by investigation of the crystal structures of this influenza virus hemagglutinin with different high-affinity analogues The interest in sialic-acid-specific adhesion of bacteria is increasing, since it often is a critical step in infectious diseases. Examples are the inflammation of gastric mucosa by Helicobacter pylori after adhesion to sialoglycoproteins of the cell surface [993, 1009] and meningitis of infants as well as urinary tract infections by E. coli . The binding of the latter bacteria via their S fimbriae to epithelial, e.g. buccal cells can be inhibited by sialylated mucins from human milk. Correspondingly, in human newborn babies sialylated substances have an anti-infective effect. Colostrum was shown to be more effective in this respect than mature milk [1010] . The S fimbrial adhesin of E. coli represents a protein complex and the genes encoding its subunits have been sequenced [988] . The introduction of specific mutations into the subunit gene sfaS revealed that a region of six amino acids of the adhesin which includes two lysine and one arginine residues is involved in the interaction of S fimbriae with sialic acid [990] .",

            "text": "The selectin family consists of three members, L-selectin, found on lymphocytes and other white blood cells, E-selectin expressed on endothelial cells activated by cytokines, and P-selectin occurring on activated blood platelets and endothelia (Table 23) . They possess a similar primary structure, representing type I trans-membrane glycoproteins containing an amino-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain, a single epidermal growth-factor-like domain, a variable number of short consensus repeats and a relatively short carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The selectins also share common aspects in their function. They all play crucial roles in the initial event of white blood cell adhesion to specific endothelia, so-called rolling. Before firm adhesion, cells floating in the blood stream begin to slow down by rolling along the endothelial lining of the vessel. This is mediated by selectins interacting with sialic-acid-containing ligands. The specificity of this interaction is accomplished by the expression pattern of the receptors and their appropriate ligands. The selectins bind with low affinity to many small, sialylated, fucosylated and in some cases sulfated carbohydrates, of which the prototypes are the At least two of the selectins (Table 23 ) recognize sLe' andor sLea, which are expressed at high levels on leukocytes [ 10401 and some tumor cells, particularly of the colon [ 104 1-10441 as components of glycoproteins or gangliosides. Sialyl-Lewis' has also been shown to be a marker of dysplasia in the colonic adenoma-carcinoma sequence [1045] . It has therefore been proposed that selectins are involved in malignant growth and metastatic events. Remarkably, 6'-sulfated sLeX (Table 23) has been identified as a major ligand (GlyCAM-1) involved in the initial attachment of lymphocytes via L-selectin to high endothelial venules of lymph nodes [ 10461. The synthesis of this \"addressin\", as L-selectin ligands are called now, 0-sulfated at C6 of galactose, has been reported [1047]. Using an L-selectin chimera, it could be shown that ligands for L-selectin also occur on the myelin sheaths of neurons of the central nervous system [1048] . Progress has been made in understanding how these molecules function at the atomic level, by determination of the three-dimensional structure of a portion of the E-selectin molecule [ 1049,10501. A spin label study has shown that the interaction of selectin on lymphocytes with sialic acid severely restricts the rotational mobility of the cell surface proteins and lipids. Additionally, the cytoplasmic viscosity increases appreciably [ 105 11.",

The interaction with T cells is assumed to be involved in early B cell activation and may also modulate signalling through the surface IgMcell receptor complex. In contrast to sialoadhesin, CD22 binds specifically to sialyl(a2-6)Gal(b14)GlcNAc structures of N-glycans [ 1023,10251. Again, Neu5Gc and Neu5,9Ac2 modulate binding of this ligand. Whereas Neu5Gc increases binding to murine CD22, 9-0-acetylation of NeuSAc is inhibitory [664] . It can only be assumed so far that these sialic acid modifications, both occurring in mice, have a biological role in the activity of the two receptors. Recognition of Neu5Ac by human CD22 is also masked by 9-0-acetylation [235] . A further regulation of CD22 function is a-2,6-sialylation of the glycan chains of the receptor molecule itself [ 10661, which inhibits receptor activity. In this way, the ligand binding sites of CD22 may be blocked and the interaction of the receptor with ligands on adjacent cells prevented. In resting B cells, which only express low levels of a-2,6-sialyltransferase activity, CD22 binding sites may be free, thus enabling interaction with neighboring cells. Lymphocyte activation, however, results in an increase in the activity of this sialyltransferase, causing sialylation of the receptor and a decrease in cellular interaction. Regulation of the sialylation of CD22 may therefore mediate adhesion and trafficking at discrete stages of B cell differentiation. In this regulatory system the expression of sialylated ligands in non-lymphoid cells may be important. It was shown that inflammatory cytokines stimulate the expression of both ligands for CD22 and 6-galactoside a-2,6-sialyltransferase in endothelial cells of human umbilical vein [ 1028,10291. Thus, CD22 could direct interactions between mature B cells and endothelial cells during inflammatory stages. These events can be influenced, i.e. lymphocyte binding inhibited, by a-2,6-sialylated glycoproteins of the blood serum. Interestingly, the two serum molecules much involved in immune and inflammatory responses, haptoglobin and IgM, are selectively recognized by lymphocyte CD22 [ 10291.",

The term \"sialoadhesin family\" was proposed for this group of related sialic-acid-binding proteins [ 10251.

Recently, a sialic-acid-binding protein was purified from human endometrium, which can bind to human spermatozoa, unless they have been sialidase-treated [ 10 161. Glycophorin A of mouse erythrocytes is recognized by a homologous peritoneal macrophage receptor specific for sialylated carbohydrates [ 10681. It should, furthermore, be mentioned that various antibodies have been described, which recognize epitopes containing mono-or oligomeric sialic acids (glycoproteins, gangliosides and bacterial capsular polysaccharides) on a variety of cells (refs. [289, 709, 1011 ,1069-10711, and various chapters of this series). Monoclonal antibodies specific for a-2,8-linked Kdn sequences suitable for histochemistry are available now [1072] . The specificity of this interaction is higher than is generally the case for lectins, since the total carbohydrate structures bearing the sialic acids have a greater influence on the binding of antibodies. Interest is, therefore, increasing in the expression of sialyltransferase activity, this being a critical regulatory step in the formation of cell-surface differentiation antigens, which may be necessary for the function of these cells, so far most dramatically shown in lymphocytes [ 1070,1073,1074]. In the immune-reactivity of sialic acid epitopes, 0-acetylation and N-acetyl hydroxylation have a strong modulatory role [668, 669, 1075] .",

Certainly, sialic acids are involved in numerous specific biological events, and many of them have been discussed in this and other articles. However, on closer inspection, it seems that sialylation exerts its influence in the diverse biological systems by the factors discussed, i.e. charge, conformation, masking and interaction with receptors. With regard to conformation, sialic acids may contribute to the specific structure of a given glycoconjugate molecule and thus may influence its biological activity. The highest degree of specificity can be observed in sialic-acid-receptor interactions, which require structurally well-defined features on both sites, not only related to the sialyl group but also to the penultimate sugars, thus resembling the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex. The interaction of influenza C virus with 9-0-acetylated sialic acid may be such an example. The specificity in these phenomena can be related mostly to the non-sialylated part of the molecule or the cell, for example to the biological specificity of a glycoprotein hormone, a bacterial toxin, a neuronal reaction, the activity of an ion channel, or the nature of the receptor and the kind of signal it transfers into the cell after ligand binding. In these systems, the sialic acid moiety plays an essential role, since its presence is a prerequisite for the receipt and transfer of biological messages. Furthermore, sialic acid can control and modulate these biological events. The exposed position of this highly negatively charged, hydrophilic molecule on extracellular glycoconjugates makes it suitable for this purpose.",

Here, some recent observations on the special influence of sialic acids in these processes will be presented to complete the main aspects of sialic acid biology. There are several reports in the literature showing that the amount and type of sialylation of membrane components influence the metastatic potential of tumor cells. A higher amount of membrane-bound sialic acid as component of glycoproteins and gangliosides promotes invasion and interferes with intercellular adhesion. Sialic acid is also involved in tumor cell attachment to endothelial cells via sLex-or sLea-binding selectins (section 10.3.2), and in adhesion of tumor cells to substances of the extracellular matrix [ 1044,1101]. These oligosaccharides are therefore considered as markers of some tumors, e.g. of human colon [1102] or thyroid gland carcinomas [1103] . In the latter case, clinicopathological studies indicate that sLea antigens are related to biologically aggressive thyroid tumors. In human colon, sLeX was found to be expressed only in cultivated cells from premalignant polyposis, but not in intermediate or carcinoma cells [ 1 1021. The higher degree of sialylation in human colorectal tumor tissue seems to be due mainly to an increase of a-2,6sialyltransferase activity sialylating N-glycan and N-acetyllactosamine sequences [ 1 104-1 1061. When studying the activity of several glycosyltransferases in human colorectal adenoma cells during progression to cancer, a-2,3-sialyltransferase activity exhibited a peak in the intermediate premalignant stage, while a-2,6-sialyltransferase appeared to be turned off in the final stage, i.e. the adenomacarcinoma cells [ 11021.

            "text": "The role of sialic acids in the formation of metastases was also shown with nude mice and human colorectal cancer cell lines [ 11081. The better differentiated cells had higher levels of sialyltransferase activity and sialic acids which correlated with their enhanced ability to form liver metastases compared to the poorly differentiated, less sialylated cell lines. The role of sialic acid in metastasis was further demonstrated by inhibition of enzymatic sialyltransfer with a CMP-sialic acid derivative (refs. [648, 649] and section 8.3), which resulted in reduced liver metastasis. An increase of a-2,6sialyltransferase activity was also observed in cultured Ehrlich ascites tumor cells [ 1 1091 and in human gastric epithelium carcinoma [ 1 1101. The increase of sialylation of an antigenic epitope of the latter tumor cells enhanced their metastatic potential. The expression of ras oncogenes in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts increases the sialic acid density and concomitantly the invasiveness of these cells and reduces cell surface galactosylation [ 1 1 1 11. Correspondingly, a-l,3-galactosyltransferase activity was decreased and those of a-2,3-and a-2,6-sialyltransferase activities were increased. Furthermore, the number and/or length of polylactosaminoglycan chains and the branching of N-glycans was also enhanced. This is another example, in which multiple changes in the expression of glycoconjugates occur on malignant transformation. It was shown with rat 3Y1 cell lines that oncogenesis can be accompanied not only by increased sialylation but simultaneously by decreased sialidase activity, thus supporting hypersialylation and metastatic potential of the cells [ 11 121. There was an inverse correlation between lysosomal-type sialidase activity and invasion. How the oncogenes mentioned operate in these processes is presently being studied. All these studies and experiments with murine lymphoid tumor cells [ 1 1131 suggest that changes either in the amount, the type or linkage of sialic acid in tumor cell glycoconjugates can affect tumor growth and metastasis.",

The conformational analysis of sialylated carbohydrate chains of glycoconjugates in their natural environment needs specific attention in order to better understand the physical and biological functions of these glycosylated molecules. Although deep insight into the metabolism of the different sialic acids has been obtained, it is challenging to further unravel the secrets of expression and transfer of these monosaccharides on the enzyme and gene levels, as well as receiving information on their regulation including hormonal control. This is particularly valid for the new group in the sialic acid family, Kdn and its derivatives. The biological roles of sialic acids are least understood, although solving these open questions seems to gain momentum. Thus, sialobiology, sialopathology and also sialopharmacology will remain most fascinating topics of future research on sialic acids.",
