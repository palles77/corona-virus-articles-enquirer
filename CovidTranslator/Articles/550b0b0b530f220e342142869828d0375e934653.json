Mclntosh'\" demonstrated that 42 percent of all wheezing attacks in children hospitalized at the National Jewish Hospital in Denver were associated with an acute viral infection. Certain viruses seem to have a particular propensity to cause wheezing, RSV being most common, followed by the parainfluenza viruses and coronaviruses. Studies of exacerbations of asthma in adults suggests that approximately 20 percent of acute exacerbations of bronchospasm are associated with a definable viral agent, chiefly influenza and rhinovirus. 2 8- 29 The relative importance of viral infection in exacerbations of bronchitis in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease is less clear. Smith et also recently reported an eight-year prospective study evaluating the effect of viral infections on symptoms and pulmonary mechanics in 84 patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. Overall, they were able to associate 20 percent of the exacerbations of chronic bronchitis with a virus, most commonly rhinovirus, followed by influenza. Most of these infections associated with viral infection produced an acute decline in FEV1 of 25 to 300 ml. In general, abnormalities were limited to a OO-day period following infection. 30 Of perhaps even greater clinical significance has been the observation from the same long-term study that viral infections in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease are associated with increased rates of isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, two of the most common bacterial organisms responsible for exacerbations of bronchitis. 31 Recent evidence suggests that even \"uncomplicated\" viral respiratory infection in adults, te, infection with clinical manifestations limited to the upper respiratory tract, and normal chest roentgenograms, is commonly associated with prolonged physiologic abnormalities, suggestive of lower respiratory tract involvement.",

            "text": "These data indicating that viral infection is associated with hitherto unanticipated, sometimes protracted, alterations in pulmonary function raise many considerations. For example, interpretation of mild obstructive disease or airway reactivity should take into consideration the possibility of an antecedent upper respiratory tract Infection, In addition, it is possible that seemingly unrelated airway irritants may be synergistic. For some years, epidemiologic studies have pointed out an association of acute respiratory infection and elevated levels of air pollution. 54 Utell and co-workersf' have recently studied the effects on pulmonary function of short-term inhalation of particulate nitrates, a common air pollutant. They found no demonstrable effect either in suggest that the damage initiating this response occurred early before therapy or is unaffected by therapy. Further evidence linking viral infection and bronchial reactivity may be drawn from several sources. Transient bronchial hyperreactivity has now also been observed in nonasthmatic, nonatopic individuals with respiratory illness caused by viruses other than influenza, Recently, we studied a naturally occurring outbreak of RSV infection in a group of young, nonatopic adults. 50 The major abnormality noted in these subjects was enhanced bronchial reactivity to cholinergic stimulation (Fig 5) . In some cases, hyperreactivity persisted for over eight weeks. This phenomenon was of particular interest, since of the respiratory viruses, RSV has been most associated with wheezing. 27 In addition to sensitization of local airway receptors, viral respiratory infection may alter the usual balance between the autonomic nervous system and humoral agents which together modulate airway muscular tone. Imbalance of the autonomic nervous system has been hypothesized as a mechanism of asthma characterized chiefly by a diminished beta-",
