            "text": "Adrienne Germain O ne of the greatest disparities between rich and poor countries and, often, rich and poor people, is in maternal mortality. The risk of dying from maternal causes in sub-Saharan Africa is 1 in 16. In western Europe it is 1 in 4000. 70% of maternal deaths occur in only 13 countries. 1 Why do more than 500 000 girls and women die every year-99% in developing countries-from preventable conditions and injuries related to pregnancy and childbirth? Why do 3\u00b79 million newborns die every year in their first 28 days of life? 2 Why are more women than men, at younger ages, living with HIV/AIDS? 62% of all young people (aged 15-24 years) infected with HIV-1 are female; in sub-Saharan Africa this proportion is 67%. 3 Generally, countries with a poor record in reproductive health have weak health systems or constraining social environments, or both, often exacerbated by poverty. Thus, the underlying causes of maternal morbidity and mortality are complex: sex discrimination in employment, education, and access to food and health care; low status of girls and young women in marriage; and poor (or non-existent) pregnancy, delivery, and post-partum care. Prevention is correspondingly complex, involving not only expansion of preventive and clinical care, but also realignment of public health and funding priorities, protection of women's rights, and behavioural changes by individuals, families, and communities. The world has prioritised and responded to communicable diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and poliomyelitis. The record on combating diseases related to sexuality and reproductive health, including HIV/AIDS, remains woefully inadequate in many parts of the world.",

The UN estimated in 2003, that one in three girls will be raped, beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime. 5 Addressing the problem from a public-health perspective, WHO led a research effort, using rigorous and uniform methodology, to assess the prevalence and effect of such violence in Bangladesh, Brazil, Japan, Namibia, Peru, Tanzania, and Thailand. WHO has received requests from other countries interested in doing similar studies, but such work is contingent on the availability of funds. 6 What is also needed is documentation of what works in prevention, follow-up care, and support. Factors contributing to violence, such as crossgenerational sex and child marriage, also require basic and applied research. 7 Another step towards addressing violence against women is the US government's $15 billion US Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003, which calls for programmes to encourage men and boys \"to be responsible in their sexual behavior . . . and to respect women, including the reduction of sexual violence and coercion\". Research on how to encourage responsible behaviour is just beginning, and should be a priority. 8 Political will and leadership Good reproductive health and autonomy for women will be achieved only through concerted popular and political effort. But building political support requires a strong evidence base, especially when making the case that full financing of reproductive health services should be a high global priority-that it is a benefit to society as a whole, worthy of investment at a time of intense competition for human and financial resources (see page 70).",

A study of maternal morbidity, which showed 17 cases of severe morbidity for each maternal death in rural India, was the only example cited for nearly two decades. 9 In 1998, WHO estimated that ten cases of serious morbidity, some with lifelong effects, occur for each maternal death. Strong data on unsafe abortion, estimated to cause 13% of maternal deaths and substantial morbidity, are also lacking. Much remains to be learned about how best to support effective use of contraception, reduce unwanted pregnancies, improve access to safe abortions, and treat women with complications after unsafe procedures. 10 To build the case for priority investment in reproductive health, research is needed in several areas.",

Many governments, especially European ones, and bodies such as the World Bank have implemented ICPD sexual and reproductive health and rights commitments. A good example is a Bangladesh national programme designed by the government, civil society (especially women's health and rights advocates), and development partners. Together, these stakeholders reviewed the evidence on reproductive health and made hard choices about which services to prioritise, given the scarce funding available. They debated the importance of, and strategies for, outreach to adolescents, and the challenges of learning about sexuality, addressing violence against women, establishing a charter of patients' rights, and making obstetric services accessible. They made a difference. Between 1998 and 2002, the percentage of women in Bangladesh receiving antenatal care went from 26% to 47%, female life expectancy increased from 58 to 60 years, and female infant and under-five mortality rates fell. The most significant decline was in maternal mortality, which dropped from 410 per 100 000 livebirths to 320. 17 The Bangladesh programme is not perfect, nor is its implementation, but by engaging all sectors of society, progress has been made.",
