In reality, the epidemic progressing in a particular country depends largely on its policy responses and interventions. Since the outbreaks in some countries are earlier than United States, the prediction of US cases can benefit from incorporating the similarity in their trajectories. We propose an empirical Bayesian time series framework to predict US cases using different countries as prior reference.",

Hence the case numbers tend to increase exponentially in the early stage, while the trends will gradually bend and plateau. Therefore, similarities in the case number trajectories can be observed in different countries, though the timing and severity can differ substantially due to different responses. Figure 1 displays the trajectories of total Covid-19 case numbers for China, S. Korea, Italy, France, Iran, Germany, Spain and USA using Johns Hopkins data. These countries have more days from time zero than US, where time zero is defined as first day with 100 or more (100+) cases as a heuristic but widely used choice 1 . The curve of South Korea increased rapidly early on but quickly bended and plateaued, for which S. Korea's swift and deterministic policy responses are credited 2 . China exhibits similar but later flattening pattern, which agrees with its missing early intervention window, but later extreme lockdown policy implementation 3 . On the other hand, the cases in Italy and France have grown exponentially until recent days, which have partially been attributed to their late and weak policy responses 4 . The US trajectory is almost linear on the logarithm scale. While the US government is catching up with policies such as work/study from home, social distancing and self-quarantine, the effect has not seen in the trajectory.",

This by design cannot incorporate government responses yet to come. Not surprisingly, these predictions can be off the target. For example, Fanelli and Piazza 7 predicted a maximum number of cases in Italy to be 15,000, where the real cases have already multipled. Batista 8 predicted the pandemic should peak around Feb 9 th , 2020, but it shows no sign of slowing down into late-March, 2020. Zheng et al 9 predicted about 20,000 cases in South Korea, which is unlikely to happen given its current flat trend around 9,000.

It shows that US and Italy have similar patterns and majority of the observed US data are in the 95% prediction intervals. This suggests that the trajectory in Italy serves as a good prior for the US prediction. Based on this prediction, on the next day as March 27 th , 2020, US may have as many as 108,595 cases.

Since the virus spread to different countries at different time, their trajectories are different in calendar time but comparable in internal time. We define time zero as the first day with 100 or more cases in a given country. We first model the trajectories of the eight countries by a functional mixed effects model 12 , where different countries shared a similar mean trajectory over time, and each country has its own random deviation curve. An additional scalar fixed effect parameter is incorporated to account for different population sizes on the natural logarithm scale. The estimated coefficient is 0.34, suggesting while the population size has some effects on the cases numbers, it is not fully proportion to the population. Both the population-average curve and random deviation curves are modeled by cubic splines. The model is then casted into state space model for computational efficiency and forecasting.
