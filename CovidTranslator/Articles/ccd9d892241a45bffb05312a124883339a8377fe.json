In this study, we devised an accurate, rapid and easy-to-use SNP detection system based on direct loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) without DNA extraction, known as Direct-LAMP. Samples from various sources (including whole blood, dried blood spot, buccal swab and saliva), treated with NaOH, can be used directly in amplification. The turnaround time was about 30 min from sample collection to provision of results. The accuracy was evaluated by assessing the polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) Glu504Lys, which are better known for their critical role in folate and ethanol metabolism, respectively. Completely consistent genotyping results reveal that Direct-LAMP is generally concordant with sequencing. This system can serve as a very promising platform in the fields of disease predisposition, drug metabolism and personalized medicine.",

            "text": "The most abundant source of genetic variation (approximately 90%) in the human genome is represented by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which can account for heritable inter-individual differences in complex phenotypes (Mhlanga and Malmberg, 2001; Yu et al., 2006) . Hence, SNP detection has great potential for direct clinical application by providing highly accurate diagnostic information for facilitating early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of genetic diseases (Everitt et al., 2012; Moore et al., 2010) . Because of its accuracy, DNA sequencing is considered to be the gold standard for SNP detection analysis. However, given the subsequent massive data analysis required by the method, sequencing is more suitable for discovery of novel SNPs rather than detection of specific known SNPs (Grant et al., 2011; Hendre et al., 2012; Muhammad et al., 2013) . Other technologies rely on sample amplification, including DNA microarrays Michal et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010) , real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Martinez-Serra et al., 2014; Psifidi et al., 2011) , selfsustained sequence replication (3SR) (Ren et al., 2014) , strand displacement amplification (SDA) (Toley et al., 2015) , high resolution melting (HRM) (Norambuena and Copeland, 2009) , Mass ARRAY (Kriegsmann et al., 2015; Suthandiram et al., 2014) , and multiplex PCR-RFLP method (Loo et al., 2012) also offer sensitive approaches for SNP detection. However, the tremendous potential of SNP detection in clinical practice has so far often been limited by the lack of efficient screening methods which cannot meet the requirements of point-of-care (POC) testing strategies due to their complex experimental procedures and long testing times (Tost and Gut, 2005) . Based on the status quo, development of a new detection platform that shortens assay times and simplifies procedures would be highly desirable. Saving time from DNA purification, a conventional step in SNP detection that not only complicates the procedure, but also enhances the risk of invalid results and cross-contamination, is a promising approach. It has been reported that new SNP detection methods have been developed based on PCR that do not require DNA extraction from whole blood, hair root and saliva (Cascella et al., 2015; Hallie and Reena, 2015; Hayashida et al., 2009) . By treating them with specific chemicals, samples can be used directly in PCR without an initial DNA purification step, which would save approximately 30 min compared with conventional SNP detection systems. However, PCR-based detection methods still require long processing times due to thermal cycling. In order to shorten the testing time further, it would be interested to adopt another simple and fast detection method, instead of PCR.",

LAMP has been used for detection of pathogens via the amplification of gene segments, including Japanese encephalitis virus infection (Mori et al., 2013) , rapid genotyping of carcinogenic human papillomavirus and herpesvirus (Mori et al., 2013) , and the detection of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (Bhadra et al., 2015; Mori et al., 2013; Notomi et al., 2015) , demonstrating the method's great potential in molecular diagnostics. Based on the advantages of this technology, LAMP has been used for genotyping with buccal swab samples, combining gold nanoparticles functionalized with ssDNA and colorimetric turbidimetry detection (Carlos et al., 2017) . Although it no longer requires DNA purification, this method still takes 3 h to perform due to its complex experimental procedure.",

Each reaction includes two common primers (F3 and B3) and two special primers (FIP-WT and BIP-WT for wild type allele or FIP-M and BIP-M for mutation type allele). The fluorescence signal coming along with target fragment amplification would be read in real-time only when the 5\u2032-end of the specific primer is complementary with the template. The structures of the specific primers used in this study are presented in Fig. 1B . The target SNP was characterized by using four different primer regions specifically designed to recognize six distinct regions on the target gene, which were selected to ensure that the primers would specifically amplify the C677T and Glu504Lys substitutions.

A few reports indicated that this method has been applied for SNPs detection successfully (Carlos et al., 2017; Iwasaki et al., 2003; Kwong et al., 2017 Kwong et al., , 2014 Nakamura et al., 2007; Nakamura and Ito, 2009; Zhang et al., 2016) , which shorten the testing time further than PCR.

However, no method combining LAMP exists for SNPs detection that can be performed within a single patient visit (30 min) directly from various clinical samples. Here, we have established a rapid, easy-to-use and accurate SNP detection platform using Direct-LAMP, which enables us to use whole blood, dried blood spot, buccal swab or saliva as samples for genotyping without DNA purification. The whole testing procedure required only 30 min from sample collection to result, which is much faster than with conventional SNP detection systems. This is the first report to introduce the pretreatment of various kinds of samples with a simple NaOH solution before LAMP for genotyping. Designed as a universal genotyping platform, this Direct-LAMP protocol has been successfully applied not only to the four sample types previously mentioned, but also verified with clinical sample, indicating that this genotyping platform could be applied to more sample types in further study. The treatment of sample with NaOH plays an important role in this Direct-LAMP, making the whole testing procedure convenience and useable. First of all, compared with other SNP detection methods, the DNA purification step is eliminated in our assay with the help of NaOH treatment, reducing the sample preparation time. Secondly, using NaOH-treated sample simplifies the complex procedures of conventional genotyping methods and eliminates the problem of cross-contamination, which happened in traditional DNA purification processes. Furthermore, various natural DNA polymerase inhibitors in whole blood, such as hemoglobin, IgG, lactoferrin, and proteases (Adams, 2005; Connelly et al., 2014; Monroe et al., 2013) , can be inactivated by treatment with NaOH solution.",

            "text": "By using Direct-LAMP, qualitative analysis can be carried out by reading the fluorescence signal automatically in real time. The major advantage of this assay system is rapid qualitative answer in ''Yes'' or ''No'' according to the fluorescence signal. Compared with conventional SNP detection methods based on PCR or DNA sequencing, Direct-LAMP shows significant advantages (Jung et al., 2015; Ngo et al., 2016) . For conventional genotyping methods that require purified DNA as template, such as PCR-microarray, qPCR and DNA sequencing, the process of DNA purification required a fair amount of time during the whole testing, whereas the present assay system requires less than 5 min for sample preparation. Traditional genotyping techniques based on PCR always require more than 1.5 h for DNA amplification, whereas the present methods based on LAMP shorten the testing time further. The process of nucleic acid amplification under isothermal conditions, employing self-recurring strand-displacement synthesis primed by a specially designed set of target-specific primers, enable this special identification system, which is faster than PCR-based methods, which use only two primers to recognize two regions (Duan et al., 2014; Tomita et al., 2008) . Thus, compared with conventional SNP detection techniques usually requiring a complex operation procedure that limits their application, the present methods provide an easy-to-operate onsite technique for genotyping with high efficiency. Therefore, the Direct-LAMP will greatly benefit molecular diagnostics by dramatically reducing turnaround time, which makes this SNP detection method very promising for POC testing in clinical diagnostics. With further development for additional SNPs and sample types, Direct-LAMP could enable rapid clinical decision-making, improve management of disease prevention and facilitate personalized medicine in each level of medical institutions.",
