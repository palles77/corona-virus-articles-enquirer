Patients with a clinical diagnosis of dengue fever and serologic confirmation (IgM or PCR positive) plus a temperature >38\u00b0C were included as casepatients. Age-matched controls were selected from the same general medical inpatient units and were admitted during the same period. All had fever, but they had a proven alternative diagnosis, including pneumonia (12 patients), upper respiratory tract infection (9 patients), urinary tract infection (6 patients), tuberculosis, liver abscess, viral fever other than dengue (3 patients each), meningitis, chickenpox, cellulitis, typhoid fever (2 patients each), and appendicitis, psoas abscess, typhus, infective endocarditis, pressure ulcers, and gastroenteritis (1 patient each). Exclusion criteria were the following: no laboratory confirmation, age <18 years or >60 years, preexisting substantial heart or lung disease or concurrent medication affecting heart rate, e.g., \u03b2-blockers, \u03b2-agonists, calcium channel blockers, or xanthine derivatives.",

Four controls had ECGs, results for 2 were normal; 1 had mild mitral regurgitation, and 1 had mild tricuspid regurgitation. The heart rates at peak temperatures for patients with dengue fever were compared with rates for controls at all temperatures.

(7) showed depressed myocardial contractility and suboptimal heart rate response in some patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever. Acute reversible hypokinesia and reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction was also reported by Wali et al. (8) . The underlying mechanisms were postulated to be immune in origin, although myocarditis may be a contributory factor. Fever production in response to exogenous pyrogens is believed to be mediated mostly by cytokine prostaglandin pathways, and neural input is important in the early phases of fever (9) . Concentrations of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interferon-\u03b3, interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-10, and IL-12, are substantially increased during dengue infection. Their levels likely correlate with specific clinical manifestations and illness severity (10) . The relationship of cytokines to relative bradycardia is unknown. Further studies could consider the relative importance of immune and neural mechanisms and also any direct cardiac pathology in the etiology of dengue-associated relative bradycardia.",

However, its status as a self-perpetuating pathogen in South America remains uncertain. Infected horses and birds have been reported in various Caribbean Islands, Mexico, and northern Central America (2, 3) . In South America, isolated reports of infected dead-end hosts (horses) have come from northern Colombia and Argentina, but they lack evidence for infection in avian amplifying hosts (4, 5) . We report serologic evidence of establishment of WNV in South America.Serum samples from birds and horses from 33 locations in Venezuela (Online Appendix Table, available from http://www.cdc.gov/ EID/content/13/4/651-appT.htm) were screened for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against WNV antigen by ELISA (6) and confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) as previously described (7) ",
