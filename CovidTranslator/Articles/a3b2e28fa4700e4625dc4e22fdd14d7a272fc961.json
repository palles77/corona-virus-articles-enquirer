The protection was ascribed to d7EB cell interaction with lung resident CD11b\u0609 cells, and was correlated with the ability of d7EB cells to reduce it also reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines by CD11\u0609 cells, and to endothelial NO synthase-derived NO by d7EB cells, leading to inhibition of inducible macrophage-type NO synthase activation in CD11b\u0609 cells. The protective progenitor cells were positive for the endothelial and hematopoietic lineage marker angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Only the ACE\u0609 fraction modulated the proinflammatory profile of CD11b\u0609 cells and reduced mortality in septic mice. In contrast to the nonprotective ACE-cell fraction, the ACE\u0609 cell fraction also produced NO. These findings suggest that an ACE\u0609 subset of human embryonic stem cell-derived progenitor cells has a highly specialized anti-inflammatory function that ameliorates sepsis-induced lung inflammation and reduces mortality.",

            "text": "Lung inflammatory injury from septic shock is the leading cause of death in patients in the intensive care unit, 1 with mortality remaining at \u03f340%. 2 The disease is characterized by progressive respiratory failure with bilateral alveolar infiltrates and lung edema. 3 Transplantation of adult bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells, endothelial progenitor cells, and bone marrow-derived progenitor cells has been studied in models of sepsis 4 -11 ; however, the results have varied, and specific cell populations responsible for the protection have not been characterized. Although in some cases transplanted cells differentiated into specialized parenchymal cells, 7,10 the lung repair observed may also be secondary to immunomodulatory effects of the transplanted cells. 4, 6, 8 Previous studies have not addressed the effects of a well-defined progenitor population derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in resolution of sepsis-induced lung injury. Because ESCs are pluripotent, it was surmised that specific progenitors derived from ESCs could effectively mitigate sepsis-induced lung inflammation and injury. Using blast progenitor cells from human ESCs (hESCs) cultured in conditions favoring development of mesoderm, 12 the present study addressed the role of a purified population of progenitor cells in the lung response to polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). It was observed that transplantation of hESC-derived progenitor cells after induction of sepsis reduced lung inflammation and edema formation, and it also reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 (TNF-\u2423) and interferon-\u2425 (IFN-\u2425) without affecting production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10. Recipient mice also demon-strated marked reduction in mortality. Dampening of lung inflammation was the result of progenitor cells enriched with the endothelial and hematopoietic progenitor cell marker angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and was largely ascribed to the interaction of these cells with CD11b\u03e9 cells in lungs. This interaction in turn mediated reduction in production of proinflammatory cytokines and high-output NO production by CD11b\u03e9 cells.",

Because the studies involved transplantation of human progenitor cells in mice, the question of xenotransplantation was considered. In mice treated with CsA, transplantation of human d7EB cells (500,000 cells in 200 L of PBS) reduced mortality after lethal CLP, from 10% in control mice receiving mitomycin-blocked mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to approximately 40% in the transplant group ( Figure 1A ). Although the CsA-immunosuppressed septic model proved useful in establishing a therapeutic role for human cells, there remained the important bias of pharmacologic immunosuppression in the sepsis model. Based on findings that ESCs and adult bone marrow stromal cells 19 -22 might not be strongly immunogenic because they generally lack major histocompatibility complex class II antigens, 23 the effectiveness of these cells in immunocompetent septic mice without the complicating effects of previous immunosuppression was evaluated. Human d7EB cells in these mice were as protective against CLP-induced death as demonstrated in CsA-treated mice; that is, survival improved from less than 10% at 48 hours after CLP in control mice to 50% in the transplant group ( Figure 1B) . Also investigated were alterations in lung vascular permeability and edema formation at 24 hours after CLP. d7EB cell transplantation significantly reduced neutrophilic lung inflammation and lung edema and prevented lung endothelial barrier dysfunction in treated mice compared with the control group (Figure 2, A-D) . The improvement in lung injury and survival was associated with decreased production of TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 in septic lungs, whereas there was no change in IL-10 production ( Figure 2E ). Despite the absence of immunosuppression, d7EB cells were not immediately rejected, and their presence in recipient mouse lungs was verified up to 24 hours after cell transplantation. Increased numbers of cells were observed in the recipient lungs at 1 and 3 hours after transplantation, as demonstrated by human-specific laminin staining ( Figure 3A ). The number of cells in the lungs gradually decreased, but cells were still detectable during the first 24 hours ( Figure 3B) ; however, no cells were visible at 48 hours after administration (data not shown).",

Supernatant NO concentrations at 6 and 12 hours after LPS stimulation of cocultured d7EB and CD11b\u03e9 cells were significantly lower than the supernatant NO concentration from CD11b\u03e9 cells alone ( Figure 5C ). This effect could not be attributed to increased apoptosis because apoptosis was not significantly different in the co-cultured CD11b\u03e9 cells compared with the CD11b\u03e9 cells cultured alone (see Supplemental Figure S1 at http://ajpamjpathol.org). Analysis of iNOS expression in co-cultured CD11b\u03e9 cells showed decreased protein expression in LPS-stimulated CD11b\u03e9 cells interacting with d7EB cells (Figure 5D ).

The cells were stimulated with LPS, 1 mg/ml, for 6 hours, and supernatant was collected for cytokine measurement using an ELISA specific for mouse cytokines.

CD11b\u03e9 cells isolated from septic mice were stimulated with LPS, 1 mg/ml, and the indicated amounts of the NO donor diethylenetriamine NONOate (DETA NO) for 12 hours. Supernatants were collected, and TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 concentrations were measured using an ELISA. lumen-containing tubes. The ACE\u03e9KDR\u03ea cells gave rise to colonies of hematopoietic precursors that stained positive for hematopoietic markers such as CD43 ( Figure  6B ). The endothelial and hematopoietic colony-forming capacity of the FACS-sorted cells was quantified by counting the number and types of colonies formed per 10,000 ACE\u03e9/KDR\u03e9, ACE\u03e9/KDR\u03ea, ACE\u03ea/KDR\u03ea, and ACE\u03ea/KDR\u03e9 cells. Endothelial colonies were formed almost exclusively by the ACE\u03e9/KDR\u03e9 fraction, with a small contribution from the ACE\u03ea/KDR\u03e9 cells, whereas the ACE\u03e9/KDR\u03ea fraction showed great efficiency in production of hematopoietic colonies ( Figure 6C ). To determine the importance of ACE and KDR markers in the observed protective phenotype against sepsis, fractionated d7EB cells were co-cultured according to their expression of ACE and KDR with the CD11b\u03e9 cells from septic mice as described above. The co-cultured cell fractions were stimulated in vitro with LPS for 12 hours, and mouse TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 production was monitored. Both the ACE\u03e9/KDR\u03ea fraction and the ACE\u03e9/KDR\u03e9 fraction significantly reduced TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 production ( Figure 6D ), indicating the critical role of the progenitor cells expressing only ACE in reducing TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 production by CD11b\u03e9 cells. In addition, a strong cell surface co-expression of ACE and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was observed in d7EB cells, suggesting an association between ACE expression and the capability to respond to LPS ( Figure 6E ). To further validate these observations, the ACE\u03e9 cells were fractionated and used for survival studies comparing them with the ACE\u03ea fraction. Only ACE\u03e9 d7EB cells reproduced the protective effect of the mixed d7EB population in survival against sepsis, whereas ACE\u03ea cells were not protective ( Figure 6F ). To examine whether the reduced production of cytokines was associated with differential NO production by the ACE\u03e9 progenitor cells, flow cytometry was used to determine co-expression of ACE and KDR with NO production. NO was produced only by the ACE-expressing cells, both ACE\u03e9/KDR\u03e9 and ACE\u03e9/KDR\u03ea, whereas ACE\u03ea cells did not produce NO ( Figure 6G ).",

Co-culturing CD11b\u03e9 cells with d7EB cells significantly reduced NO production in the culture supernatant after stimulation with LPS. This reduction in NO production was coupled with inhibition of iNOS expression in the co-cultured CD11b\u03e9 cells and in CD11b\u03e9 cells isolated from lungs of septic mice that received transplanted d7EB cells.",

This experiment reproduced the decreased generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced the iNOS expression observed in the CD11b\u03e9 cells cocultured with human d7EB cells. Thus, the results suggest a critical role of eNOS-derived NO by d7EB cells in down-regulating iNOS activation in CD11b\u03e9 cells and, thereby, dampening the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

            "text": "These studies provide a mechanistic basis by which d7EB cells prevent sepsis-induced lung inflammatory injury. hESC-derived d7EB cells responsible for the protective phenotype were identified and found to be enriched in two cell surface markers, ACE and KDR. It was also demonstrated that the population consisting of ACE\u03e9KDR\u03e9 and ACE\u03e9KDR\u03ea progenitor cells gave rise in culture to endothelial and hematopoietic colonies, respectively. In addition, the ACE-expressing cells expressed TLR4, the receptor sensing LPS, and produced NO. In contrast, ACE\u03ea cells did not exhibit these char-acteristics. The functional importance of these observations was reinforced by the ability of ACE\u03e9 fractions of d7EB cells to modulate the inflammatory cytokine production profile of CD11b\u03e9 host cells through direct cellcell interaction. ACE is constitutively expressed on the surface of endothelial and hematopoietic precursors, 41, 42 and ACE has been identified as a marker of hematopoietic stem cells present at all stages in the ontogeny of the human hematopoietic system 43 and as a novel marker of hemangioblasts differentiating from hESCs. 28 Evidence also points to an important role of ACE in sepsis. ACE knockout mice exhibited improved lung injury scores after acid aspiration, endotoxin challenge, and peritoneal sepsis. 44 Cohort studies in humans have shown a correlation between ACE polymorphisms and susceptibility to and death from adult respiratory distress syndrome, 45 and decreased plasma concentrations of ACE have been observed in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. 46 A close homologue of ACE, ACE 2, has been identified as a key factor in protection from adult respiratory distress syndrome, and it also functions as a critical in vivo receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome. 47, 48 A limitation of the present study is that the immunologic properties of human progenitor cells were studied in a xenograft model, introducing biases related to cross-species barriers. However, there is no reason to believe that species incompatibility affects the validity of the proposed mechanism, which involves interaction with host CD11b\u03e9 cells and modulation of NO production. Human cells were not acutely eliminated by the immune-competent mice because cells were detected in lungs for 24 hours after injection. These data are in accord with observations in syngeneic mouse mesenchymal stem cells 6 and may be related to the immunosuppressive nature of the human cells. 49 It is likely, however, that some degree of immunosuppression will be required for longer term xenotransplantation studies. 50 Although, to our knowledge, the present study is the first to describe the function of mesodermally differentiated hESCs in a model of lethal sepsis and lung injury, other studies have used bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells in similar models. 4,6 -11 These studies demonstrated an anti-inflammatory benefit of these cells but showed variable effects on the production of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In a polymicrobial sepsis model, the beneficial effect of bone marrow stem cells was attributed to stem cell-induced production of IL-10 by host macrophages, 6 sphingosine-1-phosphate production by stem cells, 11 and homing of stem cells to lungs through integrin expression. 7,11 hESC-derived progenitor cells represent a much earlier developmental stage than bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, and they have demonstrated ability to differentiate into niche-specific mature cells, a characteristic that distinguishes them from adult mesenchymal stromal cells. Although the importance of the interaction of hESC-derived cells with host CD11b\u03e9 cells and the association of ACE expression with the protective phenotype were observed, factors such as homing to a niche and the engraftment potential of hESC-derived cells that may also be impor-tant in the observed protection cannot be ruled out. Findings of the present study demonstrate that d7EB cells, a population of hESC-derived progenitor cells, constitute a novel immunomodulatory cell population with therapeutic potential in sepsis that may have clinical application in cell-based therapy.",
