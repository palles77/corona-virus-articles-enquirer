In Africa, drought and global warming feed the expanding deserts. In the 1990s alone, human activities led to the loss of more than 500,000 square miles of forests. 10 The story of Easter Island illustrates how much our well-being is tied to the trees that support our world in more than a metaphoric way. Polynesians colonized the island in the fi fth century, attracted in part by existing forests that seemed to offer an inexhaustible supply of wood to build houses, sea-going canoes, and the log rollers that allowed them to construct the fantastic stone monuments for which the island is famous. 11 The entire civilization collapsed several generations later largely because the trees were harvested unsustain- ably, leading to mass famine when the Easter islanders could not replace the canoes upon which their fi shery depended. 12 The Polynesians who cut the trees did not imagine the catastrophic consequences of deforestation for their once-thriving civilization.

This position of privilege also carries the responsibility to use our talents and energy, not only to mend the ills of our individual patients, but to improve the milieu in which they live. It is time to acknowledge the enormous ecological issues that affect the very substrate of life itself but that lie outside the traditional boundaries of our profession. The practice of medicine cannot proceed in a vacuum, insulated from the catastrophic changes in the ecosystem upon which life depends. We have the ability to repair much of the harm we have done. Now we need the will.",
