There have been several recently, including pandemic influenza (one of which has just occurred) (Jefferson 2009; WHO 2009 ) and a novel coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) ( Shute 2003) . Even non-epidemic acute respiratory infections (ARIs) place a serious burden on the health of nations. In total these cause much of the 7% of total deaths in the world that are attributed to lower respiratory tract infections (representing four million deaths worldwide, mostly occurring in low-income countries). In addition there is a huge burden from ARIs on morbidity and nations' healthcare systems (www.who.int/healthinfo/ global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html). High viral load and infectiousness probably increase the spread of acute respiratory infection outbreaks (Jefferson 2006a) . Stopping the spread of virus from person to person may be effective at preventing these outbreaks. This can be achieved in a number of ways. However, single interventions (such as vaccination or antiviral drugs) may be inadequate (Jefferson 2005a; Jefferson 2005b; Jefferson 2005c; Jefferson 2006a) .",

However, a recent trial showed that handwashing may be effective in diminishing mortality due to respiratory disease (Luby 2005) . The possible effectiveness of public health measures during the 'Spanish Flu' pandemic of 1918 to 1919 (Bootsma 2007 in US cities led us to wonder what evidence exists on the effectiveness of combined public health measures such as isolation, distancing and barriers. We also considered the major social implications for any community adopting them (CDC 2005a; CDC 2005b; WHO 2006) . Given the potential global importance of interrupting viral transmission, up-to-date, concise estimates of effectiveness are necessary to inform planning and decision-making. We could find no previous systematic review of such evidence.",

This may happen when viruses cross from animal species such as ducks or pigs to infect humans (Bonn 1997) . Minor changes in viral antigenic configurations, known as 'drift', cause local or more circumscribed epidemics ( Smith 2006) . High viral load and high viral infectiousness are likely to be the drivers of such epidemics and pandemics (Jefferson 2006a) . Physical means might prevent the spread of virus by aerosols or large droplets from infected to susceptible people (such as by using masks and distancing measures) and by contact (such as by using handwashing, gloves and protective gowns). Such public health measures were widely adopted during the 'Spanish Flu' pandemic of 1918 to 1919 (Bootsma 2007 .",

In addition, to include more of the literature of low-income countries in this update, we ran searches in LILACS (2008 ), Indian MEDLARS (2008 and IMSEAR (2008 . We used the following search strategy (updated to include new and emerging respiratory viruses) to search MEDLINE and CEN-TRAL. We combined the MEDLINE search strategy with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity-and precision-maximising version (2008 revision) (Ovid format) (Lefebvre 2009). We also included an additional search strategy based on the work of Fraser, Murray and Burr (Fraser 2006) to identify observational studies. The search strategies were adapted for Embase.com (Appendix 2), CINAHL (Appendix 3), LILACS (Appendix 4), Indian MEDLARS (Appendix 5) and IMSEAR (Appendix 6).",

            "text": "Three RCTs were poorly reported with no description of randomisation sequence, concealment or allocation in three studies (Gwaltney 1980; Turner 2004a; Turner 2004b) . Satomura 2005 reported the generation of randomisation but the very nature of the intervention (gargling with water with or without povidone iodine versus standard gargling with no attempt at masking the taste of iodine) made blinding impossible. The design of two trials was so artificial that their results cannot be generalised to everyday situations (Turner 2004a; Turner 2004b) . One trial (Satomura 2005) is linked to a subsequent brief report which provides contradictory information which is difficult to reconcile (Kitamura 2007) . The quality of the cluster-randomised trials varied. Only the best reported cluster coefficients and conducted analysis of data by unit of (cluster) allocation instead of by individuals (Luby 2005; Roberts 2000; Sandora 2005) . Analysing cluster-randomised trials at the individual level leads to spuriously narrow confidence intervals around the estimates of effect (Grimshaw 2004) . Other frequent problems were a lack of description of randomisation procedure, partial reporting of outcomes, unclear numerators or denominators and unexplained attrition (Carabin 1999; Kotch 1994; Morton 2004; White 2001) , and either complete failure of double-blinding (Farr 1988a; Farr 1988b) or inappropriate choice of placebo (Longini 1988) . Three cluster-randomised trials involving the use of face masks (Cowling 2008; Cowling 2009; MacIntyre 2009 ) by influenza-like illness (ILI) contacts had poor compliance. This shows the difficulty of conducting clinical trials using bulky equipment in the absence of the perception of a real threat. One trial (Cowling 2008) was also conducted in a period of low viral circulation and randomisation was carried out on the basis of two different sequences. The other study (MacIntyre 2009) was underpowered to detect differences in effect between different types of masks. The cluster-randomised trial by Sandora and colleagues (Sandora 2008) is at low risk of bias with careful evaluation of compliance in the intervention arm (hand sanitiser wipes and disinfection of surfaces). Of the four RCTs in the 2010 update, one was classified at low risk of bias (Loeb 2009 ), one at medium risk of bias (Aiello 2010a) and two (Jacobs 2009; Larson 2010) at high risk of bias.",

            "text": "Three RCTs were poorly reported with no description of randomisation sequence, concealment or allocation (Gwaltney 1980; Turner 2004a; Turner 2004b) . The design of two trials by one author means their results may not be generalised to everyday situations. This is due to the artefactual delivery of the interventions tested (see Quality of the evidence in the Discussion section) (Turner 2004a; Turner 2004b) . The quality of the cluster-randomised trials varied. Only the highest quality trials (Cowling 2009; Luby 2005; Roberts 2000; Sandora 2005) reported cluster coefficients and conducted analysis of data by unit of (cluster) allocation instead of by individuals. Analysing cluster-randomised trials at the individual level leads to spuriously narrow CIs around the estimates of effect (Grimshaw 2004) . Other common problems were a lack of description of randomisation procedure, partial reporting of outcomes, unclear numerators or denominators and unexplained attrition (Carabin 1999; Kotch 1994; Morton 2004; White 2001) and either complete failure of double-blinding (Farr 1988a; Farr 1988b) or inappropriate choice of placebo (Longini 1988) . Jacobs 2009 is an underpowered individual randomised trial carried out in Japan. Its open design means that due to lack of accounting for drop outs and definitions of outcomes the trial is at high risk of bias. In addition, no guidance as to the generalisability of its results to other settings and countries is provided to readers. Aiello 2010a is at medium risk of bias. Despite logistical and design problems the trial appears to show an effectiveness gradient of mask-wearing and hand sanitation combined versus instruction on hand sanitation and mask-wearing in student halls. The last cluster-randomised trial (Larson 2010) compared the effects of education alone versus education plus the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitiser versus education plus the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitiser plus the use of medical face masks on the interruption of self-reported upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), ILI and laboratory-confirmed influenza or other viral pathogen by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in US immigrant Latino households. Due to design issues, difficulty interpreting whether there was an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and lack of sufficient details of dropouts and other reporting problems, we classified it at high risk of bias. Loeb 2009 is a low risk of bias non-inferiority trial directly comparing the effects of surgical mask wearing versus N95 fit-tested respirators in nurses in acute units in Ontario Canada. The outcomes measured range from symptomatic and asymptomatic influenza to physician visits and ILI caused by non-influenza agents. This is possibly the most reliable piece of evidence available for this 2010 update. We classified five of the nine case-control studies as having medium risk of bias (Lau 2004a; Seto 2003; Wu 2004; Yin 2004; Yu 2007) and two as at low risk of bias (Nishiura 2005; Teleman 2004) , mostly because of inconsistencies in the text and lack of adequate description of controls. Two case-control studies (Chen 2009; Liu 2009) were at high risk of bias. Their interpretation is not straightforward. Both studies assess the effects of multiple factors as risk and protective measures for SARS during the epidemic in China. They appeared to be searching for associations and lacked preci-sion with respect to conducting true matched blinded assessments. Only live cases were considered when we know that between 10% to 20% of infected healthcare workers died in the first weeks of the epidemic (Liu 2009 mentions the high mortality rate in the Introduction). However, the studies did ascertain the cases and controls of SARS by performing confirmatory laboratory testing rather than relying on a clinical diagnosis. Six of the 16 prospective cohort studies were classified as at low risk of bias (Agah 1987; Dick 1986; Falsey 1999; Leung 2004; Madge 1992; Somogyi 2004) , four as of medium risk (Dyer 2000; Kimel 1996; Murphy 1981; White 2003) and three as of high risk of bias (Makris 2000; Master 1997; Niffenegger 1997) . One was a very brief report of a small study (Derrick 2005) and two recent studies (Broderick 2008; Wang 2007) report insufficient details to allow assessment. Four retrospective cohort studies exploring the effect of barrier interventions (Doherty 1998; Isaacs 1991; Ou 2003; Yen 2006) and one study reporting on adverse effects of barrier interventions (Foo 2006) had a high risk of bias. The other high risk of bias retrospective cohort study is Cowling 2010, mainly due to the nature of its design, heavily dependent on web availability of information. Six of the 13 controlled before-after studies were at low risk of bias (Hall 1981a; Leclair 1987; Macartney 2000; Pang 2003; Ryan 2001; Simon 2006) , two of medium risk (Krasinski 1990; Pelke 1994) and five at high risk (Gala 1986; Hall 1981b; Heymann 2004; Krilov 1996; Snydman 1988) . The most common problem in all of these studies was a lack of reporting of viral circulation in the reference population, making interpretation and generalisability of their conclusions questionable. The results of a GRADE evaluation (the GRADE Working Group available from http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/index.htm) of the case-control studies categorised them as providing low to very low quality evidence and categorised the updated RCTs as very low quality with the exception of two studies which were considered of moderate quality (Appendix 7). The overall risk of bias is presented graphically in Figure 1 and summarised in Figure 2 . ",

However, since the drop in incidence was confined to primary illness, unaffected by tissue use, we might assume they were ineffective. A community trial also reported a non-significant reduction in ARI secondary attack rates (18.7% versus 11.8%) during a time of high circulation of influenza H3N2 and rhinoviruses in the community (Longini 1988) .

            "text": "Eight cluster-randomised studies tested educational programmes to promote handwashing, with or without the adjunct of antiseptic agents, on the incidence of ARIs either in schools or in households. Because of different definitions, comparisons, lack of reporting of cluster coefficients and (in two cases) missing participant data (Carabin 1999; Kotch 1994) , we judged it improper to meta-analyse the data. Two of these trials reported a lack of effect: RR for the prevention of acute respiratory illness of 0 ; and a 50% (95% CI -65% to -34%) lower incidence of pneumonia in children aged less than five years of age in a low-income country (Luby 2005) . Another study reported a decrease of 30% to 38% in respiratory infections with additional hand-rubbing (RR for illness absence incidence 0.69, RR for absence duration 0.71) (White 2001). One study reported decreased school absenteeism of 43% with the additional use of alcohol gel as well as handwashing (Morton 2004) . Two trials reported that repeated handwashing significantly reduced the incidence of colds by as much as 20% (Carabin 1999; Ladegaard 1999) . One study found that in households in which interventions (handwashing with or without wearing a facemask) were implemented within 36 hours of symptom onset in the index patient, transmission of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed infection was reduced, an effect attributable to reductions in infection among participants using face masks plus hand hygiene (adjusted OR 0.33 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.87)) (Cowling 2009). The findings of the cluster-randomised trial by Aiello et al (Aiello 2010a) suggest that face masks and hand hygiene may reduce respiratory illnesses in shared living settings and mitigate the impact of the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic compared to no intervention or hand sanitiser and education. This conclusion is based on a significantly lower level of ILI incidence in the mask and hand sanitiser arm compared to the other two arms after adjustment for covariates (30% to 50% less in arm one compared to controls in the last two weeks of the study). However, influenza virus circulation was very low during the study period. The authors of Jacobs 2009 were unable to detect a difference in incidence of ILI of surgical mask wearing compared to no mask in healthcare workers in a Japanese hospital, possibly because of the study's lack of power. The cluster-randomised trial by Larson et al (Larson 2010) tested the addition of mask and hand sanitiser use to hand sanitiser use alone to nothing other than education which was common to all three arms. Given the many biases in the design and reporting the results are difficult to interpret: the hand sanitiser group was significantly more likely to report that no household member had symptoms (P = 0.01) but there were no significant differences in rates of infection by intervention group in multivariate analyses. Knowledge improved significantly more in the hand sanitiser group (P = 0.0001 As the data are all based on univariable analyses, they may be subject to confounding. We have separately tested how many of these measures were statistically significant in multivariable analyses (Table 1) . These data suggest that wearing a surgical mask or a N95 mask is the measure with the most consistent and comprehensive supportive evidence. Seven out of eight studies included masks as a measure in their study and six out of seven of these studies found masks to be statistically significant in multivariable analysis. Handwashing was also included in seven of the studies with four studies showing handwashing to be statistically significant in multivariable analysis. All other measures were shown to be statistically significant in multivariable analysis on only one or two occasions. Another case-control study from Hong Kong and Guangzhou hospital wards reported that a minimum distance between beds of less than one metre was a risk factor for transmission (Yu 2007) . Disaggregated data were not reported and therefore we did not pool this study in the meta-analysis. All studies selected cases from hospitals, except for one (Lau 2004a) ",

In a muchcited small experimental study, virucidal paper handkerchiefs containing citric acid interrupted the transmission of rhinovirus colds transmitted through playing cards: 42% of re-usable cotton handkerchief users developed colds compared with none using disposable virucidal tissues (Dick 1986) . Few identified studies reported interventions in the daycare setting, either in staff or patients. One staff educational programme on handwashing in a daycare centre for adults was effective over a four-year period in reducing rates of respiratory infection in daycare patients from 14.5 to 10.4 per 100 person-months to 5.7 (P < 0.001), with an accompanying decline in viral isolates. This seems to be more effective than the use of additional portable virucidal hand foam as an adjunct to handwashing (Falsey 1999) . This confirmed an earlier report of the effectiveness of a handwashing programme in reducing absenteeism for ILI in a primary school (Kimel 1996) . Two high risk of bias studies reported that education, a handwashing routine and encouragement for kindergarten children, parents and staff in correct sneezing and coughing procedure were effective, although there were considerable fluctuations in incidence of infections in the control and test centres (Niffenegger 1997); but the intervention was not effective in reducing absenteeism caused by ARIs (RR 0.79, P = 0.756) (Master 1997 A study found wearing a goggle-mask apparatus in healthcare workers visiting and caring for children aged up to five with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and symptoms of respiratory disease was effective (5% illness rate in goggle wearers against 61% in nogoggle controls) (Agah 1987). Rapid laboratory diagnosis, cohort nursing and the wearing of gowns and gloves for all contacts with RSV-infected children significantly reduced the risk of nosocomial RSV infection (OR 0.013 to 0.76) (Madge 1992), although another similar study reported no effect of adding the use of both gown and mask to the usual handwashing routine on the development of illness in personnel caring for infants with respiratory disease (4 out of 30 in the handwashing group alone compared to 5 out of 28 in the handwashing, gown and masking group, P > 0.20); although the authors described poor compliance with the barrier protocol (Murphy 1981 ",

Few attempts were made to obtain socio-economic diversity by (for example) involving more schools in the evaluations of the same programme (Dyer 2000). We were able to identify few studies from low-income countries where the vast majority of the burden lies, and where cheap interventions are so critical. Even in high-income countries, such as Israel, the dramatic fall in ARIs subsequent to school closure may have been related to that country's high child population (34%).",

The variable quality of the methods of these studies is striking. Hasty design of interventions for public health crises, particularly the SARS case-control studies, is understandable but less so when no randomisation -not even of clusters -was carried out in several unhurried cohort and before and after studies. Randomisation could often have involved minimal disruption to service delivery. Inadequate reporting especially made interpretation difficult of before-after studies. Incomplete or no reporting of randomisation (Turner 2004a), blinding (Farr 1988a; Farr 1988b) , numerators and denominators (Carabin 1999; Kotch 1994) , interventions, outcomes (White 2003), participant attrition (Makris 2000), confidence intervals (CIs) (Madge 1992) and cluster coefficients in the relevant trials (Carabin 1999) led to a considerable loss of information. Potential biases (such as cash incentives given to participants (White 2003)) were not discussed. Some trial authors even confused cohort with before-after designs to elaborate conclusions unsupported by their data (Makris 2000) . Methodological quality was sometimes eroded by the need to deliver behavioural interventions in the midst of service delivery (Niffenegger 1997). Nonetheless, even when suboptimal designs were selected, trial authors rarely attempted to articulate potential confounders. A commonly ignored confounder, specific to this area, is the huge variability in viral incidence (Heymann 2004; Isaacs 1991) . Sometimes this was addressed in the study design (Falsey 1999), even in controlled before and after studies (one attempted correlation between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) admissions and RSV circulating in the community) (Krasinski 1990) . Another attempted linking exposure (measured as nasal excretion) and infection rate in the pre-and post-intervention periods (Leclair 1987) . Inappropriate placebos caused design problems. In some studies the placebo probably carried sufficient intervention effect apparently to dilute the intervention effects (Longini 1988). Two valiant attempts probably failed because placebo handkerchiefs were impregnated with a dummy compound which stung the users' nostrils (Farr 1988a; Farr 1988b) . Some studies used impractical interventions. Volunteers subjected to the intervention hand cleaner (organic acids) were not allowed to use their hands between cleaning and virus challenge, so the effect of normal use of the hands on the intervention remains unknown (Turner 2004a; Turner 2004b) . Two per cent aqueous iodine painted on the hands, although a successful antiviral intervention, causes unacceptable cosmetic staining, impractical for all but those at the highest risk of epidemic contagion (Gwaltney 1980) . Compliance with interventions, especially educational programmes, was a problem for several studies despite the importance of many such low-cost interventions. Overall the logistics of carrying out trials in immigrant neighbourhoods or students' halls of residence are demanding and recognition should be given to all those who planned and carried out studies in very difficult circumstances (as in the middle of an epidemic).",

            "text": "The highest quality cluster-randomised trials indicate most effect on preventing respiratory virus spread from hygienic measures in younger children. Perhaps this is because younger children are least capable of hygienic behaviour themselves (Roberts 2000) , and have longer-lived infections and greater social contact, thereby acting as portals of infection into the household (Monto 1969). Additional benefit from reduced transmission from them to other members of the household is broadly supported by the results of other study designs where the potential for confounding is greater. The pooled case-control studies, which focused on the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV), suggest that implementing barriers to transmission, isolation and hygienic measures are effective with the use of relatively cheap interventions to contain respiratory virus epidemics. We found limited evidence of the superior effectiveness of devices such as the N95 respirator over simple surgical masks. This evidence is supported by a high quality hospital-based trial (Loeb 2009) which reports non-inferiority between face barriers. Overall masks were the best performing intervention across populations, settings and threats. More expensive and uncomfortable (especially if worn for long periods) than simple surgical masks, N95 respirators may be useful in very high-risk situations but additional studies are required to define these situations. It is uncertain whether the incremental effect of adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing actually decreased the respiratory disease burden outside the confines of the rather atypical studies, upon which we reported. The extra benefit may have been, at least in part, accrued by confounding additional routines. Studies preventing transmission of RSV and similar viruses appeared to be closer to real life and suggest good effectiveness. However, methodological quality concerns of the controlled before and after studies, mentioned previously, suggest benefits may have been due to population differences, especially virus infection rates. These were poorly reported in most studies. Routine long-term implementation of some of the measures assessed in this review would be problematic, particularly maintaining strict hygiene and barrier routines for long periods of time. This would probably only be feasible in highly motivated environments, such as hospitals, without a real threat of a looming epidemic. Most of the trial authors commented on the major logistic burden that barrier routines imposed at the community level. However, the threat of a looming epidemic may provide stimulus for their inception. A disappointing finding was the lack of proper evaluation of global and highly resource-intensive measures such as screening at entry ports and social distancing. The handful of studies (mostly conducted during the SARS epidemic) do not allow us to reach any firm conclusions. It is remarkable that despite a long lead time to the declaration of a pandemic, an international, prospective study to evaluate entry screening practices was not set up. The study by Cowling et al is a good contribution to our evidence base but no substitute for a well designed and conducted trial (Cowling 2010) . Finally, few studies reported harms from the interventions studied. Harms affect compliance, which may decrease even if the intervention is merely cumbersome (such as a mask) and the threat is unclear.",

RCTs with a pragmatic design, similar to the Luby et al trial, should be carried out whenever possible (Luby 2005). Nevertheless, this systematic review of the available research does provide some important insights. Perhaps the impressive effect of the hygienic measures aimed at younger children derives from the children's poor capability with their own hygiene. The variable quality and small scale of some studies is known from descriptive studies (Aiello 2002; Fung 2006; WHO 2006) and systematic reviews of selected interventions (Meadows 2004). More research is needed to evaluate the most effective strategies to implement successful physical interventions in practice, both on a small scale and at a population level. More attention should be paid to describing and quantifying the harms of the interventions assessed in this review and their relationship with compliance.",

ILI cases were given contact nurses phone numbers to record the illness and paid USD 25 to provide a throat swab. 368 participants had ILI and 94 of these had a throat swab analysed by PCR. 10 of these were positive for influenza (7 for A and 3 for B), respectively by arm 2, 5 and 3 using PCR, 7 using cell culture Safety: n/a Notes The authors conclude that \"These findings suggest that face masks and hand hygiene may reduce respiratory illnesses in shared living settings and mitigate the impact of the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic\". This conclusion is based on a significantly lower level of ILI incidence in the mask and hand sanitiser arm compared to the other 2 arms after adjustment for covariates (30% to 50% less in arm 1 compared to controls in the last 2 weeks of the study) Comparison with the ILI rate of the control arm may not be a reflection of the underlying rate of ILI because the intervention arm received instruction on hand sanitation and hand etiquette The play of adjustments is unclear. The intra cluster correlation coefficient is reported in the footer of Table 4 . Its very small size suggests lack of clustering within halls The role of the spring break is mentioned in the Discussion as are the results of this study compared to other studies included in our review (Cowling 2008 and MacIntyre 2009) The authors report that 147 of 1297 participants (11.3%) \"at baseline\" had ILI symptoms and were excluded from analysis. During the 6 weeks of the study 368 of 1150 participants (32%) had ILI. This averages out at about 5% per week. It is unclear what the term \"at baseline\" means. Presumably this means during the 2 to 3 weeks of participant enrolment. If this is so, the reason for the triggering of the interventions (tied to influenza isolation) are obscure as the trial is supposedly about ILI and an ILI outbreak was already underway \"at baseline\" Low risk Attrition is reported as follows: 9, 11 and 19 ineligible and 26, 52 and 21 lost to follow up (respectively by arm). This makes a total of 39 and 99 for each cause of attrition.

The authors conclude that social distancing did not reduce FRI and that environmental contamination rather than person to person transmission is the culprit in the spread of FRI. The method used for social distancing, however, did not exclude those that were little bit sick but did not require placement in the MCU.

Also, analysis of closed units according to the population size was not done and information about the location of the closed units (all over the centre or localised in certain (isolated) area) is lacking. Despite these clear limitations this pragmatic study's findings may be interpreted in a variety of different ways. Perhaps the most interesting interpretation is that environmental conditions are determinants of adenoviral infectivity but not entry and exit from a community. In other words virological and presumably bacterial agents persist in the environment, they are not \"brought\" in and do not \"arrive\" and do not directly and invariably cause one-on-one disease. This hypothesis challenges the current simplistic interpretation of the postulates of Henle-Koch (one agent = one disease and suggests that the presence of microorganism may only be one of the many variables which determine infectious disease. This interpretation is comforted by the relatively small number of isolates found in studies of ILI causes (so called pie studies) The corresponding author provided the following additional information: each week a new cohort of about 500 recruits arrives at the camp, all of whom arrive by Wednesday. On Thursday the recruits are assigned to 6 platoons (each platoon housed in its own large room -called \"housing units\" in the article). Each cohort's 6 housing units are numbered from 1 to 6, with no particular distinction between them. Each house is given approximately the same number of recruits. The placement of the recruits into the housing units is based somewhat on the order of their arrival to the camp, but otherwise there are no criteria for placement, although relatives and friends are allowed to be in the same platoon. The recruits at MCRD San Diego tend to be from west of the Mississippi. There is no particular order of arrival at the camp from different regions. The number of the closed housing unit assigned in each cohort varied. In the majority of cases it was 1 or 2",

Probable SARS cases were defined using the criteria by the China Health Ministry. Criteria for probable and suspected SARS cases included travel to a SARS epidemic area in the 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms or close contact with a probable SARS patient; fever of \u2265 38\u00b0C; chest X-ray abnormalities; normal or decreased leukocyte count; and no response to treatment by antimicrobial drugs.

The design and analysis are very similar to those of Ma 2004/Liu 2009 and the design also lacks focus. i.e. it does not test a defined hypothesis, but trawls through large numbers of variables looking for associations. There is no attempt at matching cases with controls and part of the design is prospective (IgG estimation).

The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the SAB sanitiser at reducing illness absenteeism in a school setting. Subjects were grouped by classroom without formal randomisation. 7 classes received the instant sanitiser, while the remaining 7 classes were assigned to the control group. Male-to-female ratios and age distributions of the 2 groups did not differ significantly Prior to study commencement all students participated in an educational programme about germs and the importance of handwashing to prevent illnesses. Children in the hand sanitiser group received a spray to use under teacher supervision to supplement normal, at-will handwashing with soap and water. The control group was instructed to wash hands with water and soap, and it was not supervised. Data were collected for 10 weeks. After this period, there was a 2-week wash-out period, during which neither group of students used SAB sanitiser. Then SAB sanitiser was distributed to the student group that had previously served as the control and the study proceeded for another 4 weeks Notes Risk of bias: medium Notes: the authors conclude that daily use of the SAB instant hand sanitiser with at-will handwashing using soap and water significantly decreased absences due to acute communicable illness. Use of the sanitiser reduced illness absenteeism by 41.9% (reduction in respiratory illnesses of 49.7% over the 10-week period of the study). The authors also described some limitations of the study, as limited socio-economic diversity in the study population, limitation to a single study site and lack of blinding. Further soapand-water washing was not monitored. Generalisability of the results is questionable as all participants underwent the educational programme Notes Risk of bias: low Notes: the authors conclude that the educational programme for staff was associated with an almost 50% decrease in the infection rate in daycare attendees. The programme was effective only in the last of the 4 years of the programme (rates of infection in daycare patients fell from 14.5 to 10.4 per 100 person-months to 5.7 per 100 person months, P < 0.001). This is a conclusion based on an ecological study of the incidence of ILI in 3 previous seasons which the authors report in the same paper, but which does not report numerators and denominators and was not extracted. The lower infection rate is likely to reflect the combination of interventions and education, which increased staff awareness and more broadly changed behaviour. There was no apparent additional benefit from the virucidal foam. This is one of the few identified studies reporting circulating viruses in the daycare setting, both in staff and patients. The decline in influenza-like illness episodes across the 4 study years is reflected in the decline in viral isolates, suggesting that aspecific measures such as handwashing are effective against the main respiratory viruses ",

Many of the families were enrolled, because one or more members worked at the State Farm Insurance Company; the remaining families were recruited from the Charlottesville community by advertisement in a local newspaper. Families were randomly assigned by the sponsoring company to receive boxes of treated tissues, placebo tissues or no tissues. The randomisation was performed by computer. Study participants and investigators were unaware of the type of tissues which each family was randomised to receive. Blinding efficacy was tested using a questionnaire: the mothers in each family were asked twice if she believed her family was using virucidal or placebo tissues Participants in the treated and placebo groups were instructed to use only tissues received through the study, while families in the additional control group without tissues were allowed to continue their usual practice of personal hygiene. Each family member kept a daily listing of respiratory symptoms on a record card. A nurse epidemiologist visited each family monthly to encourage recording Participants 186 families, 58 in the active group, 59 in the placebo group and 69 in the no tissues group. A total of 302 families were originally recruited, 116 families who did not comply with the study protocol, lost their surveillance cards, could not complete the protocol were excluded from the analysis Notes Notes: the authors conclude that virucidal tissues have only a small impact upon the overall rate of natural acute respiratory illnesses. The total illness rate was lower in families using virucidal tissues than in both of the other 2 study groups, but only the difference between active and placebo groups was statistically significant (3.4 illness per person versus 3.9 for placebo group, P = 0.04 and 3.6 for no tissues control group P = 0.2, and overall 14% to 5% reduction). The questionnaire results suggest that some bias may have been present since a majority of mothers in the virucide group believed they were receiving the \"active\" tissues. Another possible explanation of the low effectiveness of virucidal tissues is poor compliance by children in the use of virucidal tissues. A welldesigned and honestly reported study",

In order to define the population at risk of developing RSV infection it was determined the number of children under 2 years of age hospitalised on the 2 paediatric wards and the paediatric intensive care unit and the number they spent in hospital. For the next 2 winters (1987 to 1988 and 1988 to 1989) the same data were prospectively collected. In addition some interventions were made to try to reduce the incidence of hospital-acquired RSV infection. Children admitted with suspected RSV infection were nursed in a specific area until the result of an indirect immunofluorescent test. It was not possible to cohort babies on the paediatric intensive care unit. Staff were instructed on the importance of handwashing and this was reinforced on ward rounds. An educational leaflet was prepared and given to the parents of every child admitted with the infection Notes: the authors concluded that handwashing and cohorting reduced at least 66% in the number of hospital acquired infections due to RSV in the 2 intervention winters. One minor problem with cohorting was that babies could not remain in the accident and emergency department until a diagnosis of RSV was virologically confirmed. Hence they were cohorted on the basis of a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis. The authors also underline the importance of a more rapid antigen test for RSV. It is doubtful whether the non-exposed cohort is similar to its hospital peers, especially because there are several cardiac children in the exposed cohort. The biggest limit to this study is mentioned by the authors in the Discussion: the assumption that the circulation of RSV is constant throughout the study period. Exposure however is not the same in the 3 seasons and observed effect may be due to cohorting or to the different viral circulation ",

No significant differences were found between participating classes for size, male-female ratio, percentage of low-income students, or students with chronic health problems. Teachers were surveyed to determine classroom handwashing activities. The influenza season usually occurs during December and January. The handwashing programme was planned for presentation just prior to this time. The effectiveness of the programme was determined by comparing absentee rates among participants and non-participating classes (the control group). Absentee rates were determined by reviewing the computerised daily school absence logs. Entries that listed flu-like symptoms were counted. A take-home handwashing chart was also given to each student to encourage follow-through with handwashing at home Participants 199 children of kindergarten and first grade schools",

Knowledge improved significantly more in the Hand Sanitizer group (P,0.0001). The proportion of households that reported >50% of members receiving influenza vaccine increased during the study (P,0.001). Despite the fact that compliance with mask wearing was poor, mask wearing as well as increased crowding, lower education levels of caretakers, and index cases 0-5 years of age (compared with adults) were associated with significantly lower secondary transmission rates (all P,0.02). In this population, there was no detectable additional benefit of hand sanitiser or face masks over targeted education on overall rates of URTIs, but mask wearing was associated with reduced secondary transmission and should be encouraged during outbreak situations. During the study period, community concern about methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was occurring, perhaps contributing to the use of hand sanitiser in the Education control group, and diluting the intervention's measurable impact\".",

            "text": "Methods Open non-inferiority randomised, controlled trial carried out to compare the surgical mask with the N95 respirator in protecting healthcare workers against influenza. The trial was carried out between 2008 (enrolment started in September and follow up on 12 January 2009) and 23 April 2009 (when all HCWs were told to wear a N95 respirator for all HCWs caring for febrile patients because of the appearance of novel A/H1N1) . The trial trigger was the beginning of the influenza season defined as isolation of 2 or more viruses in a district in the same week. Following the 2003 SARS outbreak all Ontario nurses caring for febrile patients (38\u00b0C or more and new onset cough or SOB) had to wear surgical masks. The randomisation (carried out in blocks of 4 by centre) then consisted of either confirmation to same-maker surgical mask wear or N95 respirator wear. Investigators and laboratory staff were blind to allocation status, but for obvious reasons (the visible difference in interventions), participants were unblinded. \"The criterion for non-inferiority was met if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the reduction in incidence (N95 respirator minus surgical group) was greater than -9%\". So this is the non-inferiority margin. It is assumed that the \"minus surgical group\" means minus surgical mask group Surgical masks (as standard wear by the standard distributor) or fit-tested N95 respirator. All nurses wore gloves or gowns in the presence of a febrile patient Outcomes Laboratory RT-PCR paired sera with 4-fold antibody rise from baseline (only for unvaccinated) nurses Effectiveness: follow up (lasting a mean of around 97 days for both arms) was carried out twice-weekly on a web-based instrument. Nurses with new symptoms were asked to swab a nostril if any of the following signs or symptoms had developed: fever (temperature > 38\u00b0C), cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, headache, sinus problems, muscle aches, fatigue, earache, ear infection or chills The text defines influenza with laboratory-confirmation and separately reports criteria for swab triggering and a definition of ILI (\"Influenza-like illness was defined as the presence of cough and fever: a temperature > 38\u00b0C\"). But this is not formally linked to influenza in the text as it appears that primary focus was the detection of laboratoryconfirmed influenza (either by RT-PCR or serology) Additional outcome data sought were work-related absenteeism and physician visits for respiratory illness Secondary outcomes included detection of the following non-influenza viruses by PCR: parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3 and 4; respiratory syncytial virus types A and B; adenovirus; metapneumovirus; rhinovirus-enterovirus; and coronaviruses OC43, 229E, SARS, NL63 and HKU1 Audits to assess nurse compliance with the interventions were carried out in the room of each patient cared for. The text reports that 50 and 48 nurses in the surgical mask and N95 groups respectively had laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, indicating noninferiority. Interestingly non-inferiority seemed to be applicable both to seasonal viruses and nH1N1 viruses (as 8% and 11.9% were serologically positive to nH1N1). This finding is explained either by seeding or cross reaction with seasonal H1N1. Equivalent conclusions could be drawn for nurses with complete follow up. Non-inferiority was applicable also to other ILI agents identified. None of the 52 persons with positive isolates met the criteria for ILI All cases of ILI were confirmed as having influenza (9 and 2 respectively). This means that all the 11 cases of ILI had influenza but that most of those with a laboratory diagnosis of influenza did not have cough and fever. For example the text reports that \"Of the 44 nurses in each group who had influenza diagnosed by serology, 29 (65.9%) in the surgical mask group and 31 (70.5%) in the N95 respirator group had no symptoms\". By implication of the 88 nurses with antibody rises 28 had symptoms of some kind, i.e. two-thirds were asymptomatic. Absenteeism was 1 versus 39 episodes in the mask versus respirator arms. No episodes of LRTI were recorded. The number of family contacts with ILI were the same for each arm (45 versus 47). Physician visits were similar in both groups Safety: no AEs are reported",

Alternate 2-month gowning and no-gowning cycles were established in a 24-bed NICU for 8 months. One entire 4month cycle was repeated to eliminate the potential for seasonal variables and outbreaks. All the people entering into the NICU (physicians, nursing staff, ward clerks, families and visitors) wore gowns. During the no-gowning periods nursing staff wore hospitalissued pantsuit, washed at home through ordinary methods and worn from home. Ward clerks, physicians, hospital staff, families and visitors wore street clothes without gowns. Throughout the entire 8-month period, there was the recommendation for all staff and visitors to enforce initial 2-minute hand-scrub. Nails were cleaned before scrubbing, and a minimum 15-second handwash between infants or equipment was expected. Notes: the authors conclude that gowning did not protect NICU infants from any type of infection or affect mortality (1.21 versus 1.38/100 patient-days of gowning and nogowning periods respectively). Gowning procedures did not deter staff or visitors from entering the unit, since traffic was also unchanged between periods. Finally the results showed no change in handwashing patterns between periods. Besides the advantage of eliminating a potentially unnecessary ritual that may be perceived as a psychological barrier to families visiting their infants, other benefits to discontinuing gowning include saving staff time involved in various gowning procedures and costs. If gowns are eliminated, it is recommended to perform careful follow up. The study conclusions must be taken with caution given the likely selection bias introduced by the missing 17% of children ",

The study also aimed to describe the viral and bacterial contamination of common surfaces in the school classroom and to assess the impact of an environmental disinfectant on the presence of selected viruses and bacteria on these surfaces. Clustering was described as \"teams of 3-4 classes depending on the class year\" Participants A total of 363 students in 15 different classrooms were eligible to participate and received letters about the study. A total of 285 of these students provided written informed consent and were randomly assigned to the intervention group (146) or to the control group (139).

The intervention did not impact on absenteeism from respiratory illness. In addition, norovirus was detected less frequently on classroom surfaces in the group receiving the intervention. The study is good quality with low risk of bias. The authors checked compliance by counting discarded wipes. Reasons given for the apparent lack of effect against ARIs but good effect on GI illness are that disinfecting the classroom surfaces (daily at lunchtime with alkali) was important -as well as the alcohol wipes. The authors measured the norovirus concentration on surfaces and found this reduced. Other reasons may be that droplets are not affected by this method or that contamination of hands by respiratory infections is likely to be continuous (in orofaecal transmission is mostly at the time of defecation)",

However, no significant difference was observed against ILIs Study was well-conducted, blinding would have added to the validity of the results. In addition, the study was not powered enough to detect significant preventative effect against ILI The study demonstrated that in addition to handwashing, simple gargling even with simple water can reduce URTI but not ILI. However, during periods of endemic influenza, multiple inexpensive and simple modalities (handwashing, masks, gargling) can be utilised together to reduce infection and transmission. Overall, the reporting of the 2 combined studies together is highly confusing. In the first study (Satomura 2005) the main outcome is URTI defined as fever and arthralgia. The second study (which is a presentation of further data from the 2005 publication in the guise of a short report) introduces the outcome ILI with a definition similar to that of URTI in the first study but referring to the earlier outcome as common cold. Also of note is reporting of significance without confidence intervals. Overall this potentially important study should be repeated with a larger denominator Medium risk of bias because of confused reporting and absence of double-blinding",

This is a before-after design, with a multifactorial intervention carried out in one hospital Participants 6548 paediatric patients admitted at the University Children's Hospital in the period of study (2200 in 1999 to 2000; 2298 in 2000 to 2001; 1959 in 2001 to 2002 The authors conclude that the multi-factorial prevention strategy (early diagnosis, a strict cohorting and contact isolation policy, and prospective surveillance) probably contributed significantly to the reduced risk of nosocomial RSV infections in the hospital. In the pre-intervention period there were 39 cases (13.8%) nosocomial infections with an incidence density of 0.99/1000 patient-days; following the introduction of the surveillance and prevention policy there was a 9-fold decrease of the incidence (1.67 versus 0. 18/1000 patient-days) Notes: the authors concluded that organic acids commonly used in over-the-counter skin care and cosmetic products have substantial virucidal activity against rhinovirus. These preparations provided effective residual antiviral activity on the hands. The virucidal effect of these hand treatments resulted in a reduction in the incidence of rhinovirus infection in the treated volunteers (P = 0.025). The utility of this observation in the natural setting remains to be determined. The volunteers were not allowed to use their hands in the interval between the hand treatment and the virus challenge, so the effect of normal use of the hands on the virucidal activity of these organic acids is not known. Similarly, the virus challenge method used in these experiments may not simulate the natural setting in all aspects. The effect of nasal secretions that would be transferred with the virus in the natural setting on the activity of the acids or on the transmission of virus was not tested in the model We are unsure as to the practical significance of this study and the generalisability of its results to the real world.

Winnipeg, Canada, to assess the residual virucidal activity of a skin cleanser wipe and its effectiveness in preventing experimental rhinovirus colds. Subjects in good health and from 18 to 60 were recruited from Winnipeg and surrounding communities for participation The residual activity of a skin cleanser wipe containing 4% pyroglutamic acid formulated with 0.1% benzalkonium chloride was tested. The negative control treatment was 62% ethanol. Benzalkonium chloride had been previously tested and was found to have no virucidal activity. Volunteers were randomly assigned to use the control preparation or the active preparation. The study material was applied to hands with a towelette. Fifteen minutes later, when the fingers were completely dry, the fingertips of each hand of the control subjects and the volunteers in the active treatment group were contaminated with rhinovirus type 39. An additional volunteer in the active group were challenged with virus 1 hour after application and the final group of volunteers was challenged 3 hours after application. Viral infection was assessed by culture of nasal lavage specimens and blood samples The authors conclude that focusing quarantine efforts on persons with known or suspected exposure can greatly decrease the number of persons placed under quarantine, without substantially compromising its yield and effectiveness. This is an important study, as it implies that risk banding can increase effectiveness and efficiency of quarantine procedures. The risk of bias is high as most of the answers to the NOS items are clearly no, however it is very difficult to get answers to a question such as the effectiveness of quarantine using any other design ",

Record review for the retrospective part and prospective study for the 2 seasons following the introduction of infection control measuresParticipants HCW and patients in the special care baby unit Interventions From the 1984 to 1985 season the following were introduced: Active surveillance Extensive cohorting of patients and staff Respiratory precautions on suspicion of respiratory case Gown, mask and gloves used on contact Notes Risk of bias: high Notes: the authors conclude that there were 7 cases in the season \"before\" and no cases in the following seasons (no transmission per 1000 patient days in the post-intervention period compared 8 per 1000 patient-days in the pre-intervention period). No denominators are provided (hence no data can be extracted) and exposure is generically quantified by aggregate patient-days of exposure. It is unclear how the circulation of RSV outside related to the claimed success of the measures, as no information is provided Interventions Three masks, 2 without air filter and allowing external exhalation, 1 with manifold and air filter Outcomes Effectiveness: plume of droplets as observed and photographed: masks were poor at preventing droplet spread Somogyi 2004 (Continued) Notes Risk of bias: low Notes: the authors conclude that the mask with manifold and air filter did not allow dispersal of droplets and was far safer in an epidemic such as SARS to contain the spread.

The study aimed at assessing the effects of hand hygiene on URTIs and absenteeism. Allocation was by residence hall with 2 halls doing \"knowledge studies\" being allocated, one to each arm Participants 430 students aged around 18 mainly females were recruited but only 188 in the intervention cluster and 203 in the control cluster completed at least 3 weeks' follow up. Students were recruited with cash incentives. No reasons for attrition are givenInterventions Education programme and alcohol gel adjunct to handwashing in residence halls versus standard hygiene Outcomes Laboratory: in vitro testing of the antibacterial and antiviral properties of the hand rub Effectiveness: URTI (at least 2 symptoms with one of them lasting at least 2 to 3 days.

Weekly surveys were carried out before during and after the study Safety: N/A Notes Risk of bias: medium Notes: the authors conclude that the intervention resulted in significantly fewer symptoms (reductions of 14.8% to 39.9 %) and absenteeism (40% reduction). Unexplained attrition and unknown effect of cash incentives. Relatively unclear definition of illness with a hint of a sensitivity analysis in the footer to a The authors conclude that the integrated infection control strategy appeared to be effective in reducing the incidence of HCWs contracting SARS. Point estimates? 95% CIs. The advantages included rapid implementation without negative pressure isolation rooms, flexibility to transfer patients, and re-enforcement for HCWs to comply with infection control procedures, especially handwashing. The efficacy and low cost are major advantages, especially in countries with large populations at risk and fewer economic resources The authors conclude that environmental risk factors were significantly associated with the occurrence of a super spreading event (clustering of \u2265 3 cases) included minimum distance between beds of \u2264 1 m and performance of resuscitation in the ward. Use of BIPAP ventilation and use of oxygen were the significant risk factors associated with the host patient. Of the administrative factors, allowing staff with symptoms to work also increased the risk. Providing adequate washing or changing facilities for staff was protective As disaggregate data are not reported we did not extract numerator/denominator data ",
