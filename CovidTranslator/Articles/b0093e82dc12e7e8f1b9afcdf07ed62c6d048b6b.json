Collaborating effects of cross-reactive antibodies on YF immunogenicity. YF vaccination triggers upregulation of interferon-related genes, resulting in antiviral responses that can reduce virus uptake, replication and immunogenicity. However, with enhancing levels of cross-reactive antibodies, YF immune complexes formed can result in increased uptake via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) leading to prolonged viremia. In addition, coligation of the activating Fc\u03b3Rs by immune complexes under ADE conditions can lead to increased expression of inflammatory metabolites and semaphorins expression that may play crucial roles in antigen-presentation, resulting in eventual improvement in immunogenicity of YF vaccination.
