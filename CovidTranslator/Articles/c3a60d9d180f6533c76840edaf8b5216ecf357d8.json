We simulated the dispersion process of the droplets with initial diameter of 100 \u03bcm, 10 \u03bcm and gaseous contaminant in unidirectional ventilated protective isolation room and studied the droplets dispersion and cross transmission with different sizes. The droplets with initial size of 100 \u03bcm settle out of the coughing jet quickly after coming out from mouth and cannot be carried by the coughing jet to the human thermal plume affecting (HTPA) zone of the susceptible manikin. Hence, the larger droplets disperse mainly in the HTPA zone of the source manikin, and the droplets cross transmission between source manikin and susceptible manikin is very small. The droplets with initial size of 10 \u03bcm and gaseous contaminant have similar dispersion but different removal process in the UVPIR. Part of the droplets with initial size of 10 \u03bcm and gaseous contaminant that are carried by the higher velocity coughing airflow can enter the HTPA zone of the susceptible manikin and disperse around it. The other part cannot spread to the susceptible manikin's HTPA zone and mainly spread in the source manikin's HTPA zone. The results from this study would be useful for UVPIR usage and operation in order to minimize the risk of cross infection.",

Some existing study indicated that unidirectional ventilation system combined with an appropriate air filtration system could greatly decrease the cross infection risk and increase patient survival rate effectively (Storb et al. 1983 ; Barnes and Rogers 1989; Passweg et al. 1998; Schlesinger et al. 2009 ).",

            "text": "As discussed in previous study, although the unidirectional ventilated protective isolation room (UVPIR) is patient room in hospital, it has difference with airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) and operating theatre (OT) (Yang et al. 2015) . Hence, the research findings in AIIR and OT may not applicable in UVPIR. Laminar airflow system has been widely used in operating theatre to decrease rates of surgical site infections (SSI). In recent years, some scholars doubted the effect of laminar airflow on the reduction of wound infections. For example, Gastmeir et al. (2012) investigated the influence of laminar airflow on the surgical site infections and concluded that it would be a waste of resources to establish new operating room with laminar airflow system. James et al. (2015) reviewed the current literature for the use of laminar airflow operating theatre ventilation during total joint arthroplasty and examined the effectiveness of laminar airflow on preventing post-operative wound infection and found that there is no conclusive effect on the reduction of post-operative wound infections by laminar airflow system. The vertical laminar airflow system directs air from ceiling to floor. The airflow passes over the head and upper body of the surgeon and assistants to the surgical site. During surgical procedures, bacteria-laden dust particles, textile fibers, and respiratory aerosols may be released from the surgical team in to the air of the operating room. These bacteria may be carried by the downward airflow to settle on the surgical instruments or directly enter the surgical site and lead to surgical site infection (James et al. 2015; McHugh et al. 2015) . The key reason that the vertical laminar airflow may lead to surgical site infection is that the bacteria sources (the head and upper body of the surgeon and assistant) located at the upper area of the patient. The relative positions of patient and doctors or nurses are different in UVPIR and operating theatre. The vertical laminar airflow from the whole ceiling in the UVPIR will create an entire protective environment for the patient from being infected from doctors or nurses who may enter into the ward. The bacteria from the doctors or nurses will be carried by the downward airflow to the floor level and removed from the exhaust opening located at the bottom of the two sidewalls. Hence, using vertical laminar airflow system to decrease cross infection risk is more appropriate in UVPIR than in operating theatre.",

Olmedo et al. (2013) investigated the risk of airborne cross-infection between the two breathing thermal manikins in a room with vertical low-velocity ventilation. Nielsen et al.

Chao et al. (2009) measured the droplet size using the interferometric Mie imaging (IMI) technique. The droplet size distribution obtained by their study was more in line with the data obtained by Duguid (1946) . The geometric mean diameter of the droplets expelled from coughing and speaking was 13.5 \u03bcm and 16.0 \u03bcm, respectively from their study. The droplet concentrations were range from 0.004 to 0.223 cm \u22123 for speaking and 2.4-5.2 cm \u22123 per cough for coughing. The average number of droplets/particles emitted each sneeze and cough was 1 \u00d7 10 6 and 5 \u00d7 10 3 , respectively. Larger droplets may settle out of the airflow quickly and thus the cross transmission only happens when the individuals are close enough. Smaller droplets may hang in the air for longer time and spread for longer distance, thus will have higher risk of cross transmission between person to person (Riley 1974; Brachman 1990 ). Overall, existing research showed that the droplets of different sizes have different dispersion characteristics and cross transmission risk.",

Built upon this airflow model, we intend to simulate the dispersion process of the droplets with the following three initial sizes: large (100 \u03bcm), medium (10 \u03bcm), and small (represented by gaseous contaminant). Particles smaller than 2 \u03bcm were found to share the common dispersion and transport properties of air (Chen et al. 2006) . It is feasible to simulate the smaller particle with species transport model, but not for larger particles concerned in this study.",

The downward airflow directions are changed by the thermal plume from manikin and created two \"human thermal plume affecting zones\" (HTPA zones), which is defined as the vortex area affected by the human thermal plume (Yang et al. 2014) . The downward airflow near the manikin is pulled up by the manikin thermal plume and creates a vortex airflow around the human body. The existence of the HTPA zone has mixed effects. On one hand, the HTPA zone around the manikin can create a protective barrier and prevent the contaminant from entering the zone Fig. 3 The airflow field in the UVPIR and avoid contaminant cross transmission. On the other hand, if the contaminants are entrained into the HTPA zone, the upward airflow in the zone will carry the contaminant to the manikin's breathing zone and lead to cross transmission. The effective way to decrease cross transmission is to prevent contaminants from entering the HTPA zone of the susceptible manikin. The dispersion process of the droplets with initial diameter of 100 \u03bcm from coughing is shown in Fig. 4 . These droplets carried by the coughing jet can move forward for a very short distance (less than 0.3 m) before going downward, and mainly disperse in the HTPA zone of the source manikin after that. The droplets settle out of the coughing jet quickly after emitted from source manikin's mouth. Very few droplets remain in the UVPIR one minute after. Figure 5 shows the dispersion process of the droplets with initial diameter of 10 \u03bcm. Approximate 60% of the droplets carried by the coughing jet move forward for approximately 0.6 m, enter into and disperse in the HTPA zone of the susceptible manikin. The other parts of droplets (approximate 40%) remain in the HTPA zone of the source manikin and mainly disperse around the source manikin area. As shown in Table 1 , the peak coughing velocity can reach 9 m/s. Such high velocity coughing jet can easily break out the protective barrier and enter into the HTPA zone of susceptible manikin. However, after coughing, the source manikin respires via nose. The peak breathing velocity drops down to 2.9 m/s. During the respiration process, the breathing air cannot break out the protective barrier and enter the HTPA zone of the susceptible as shown in Fig. 5 . Hence, when the velocity of the coughing airflow is higher (much higher than 2.9 m/s), the droplets can be carried by the high Fig. 4 The dispersion process of droplets with initial diameter of 100 \u03bcm velocity coughing jet to the susceptible manikin's HTPA zone. But when the velocity of the coughing airflow is lower, the droplets cannot reach the susceptible manikin's HTPA zone. One minute after, most of the droplets are removed from the room.",

            "text": "The dispersion processes of the droplets with initial diameter of 10 \u03bcm and gaseous contaminant are similar from the comparison between Figs. 5 and 6. Figure 7 shows how the droplet sizes change with time for different initial size droplets. For the droplets with initial size of 10 \u03bcm, the size remains nearly the same in the first 2 seconds due to high relative humidity of the breathing air, and then decreases rapidly to 2.6 \u03bcm in the following 0.4 seconds. The droplets with initial size of 10 \u03bcm become droplet nuclei with size of 2.6 \u03bcm rapidly after entering into the room. Zhao and Wu (2005) proposed an indicator to judge whether the particle can be treated as passive transport or gaseous contaminant. By calculating, we found when the particle size is less than 10 \u03bcm, the indicators of the droplets/particles in UVPIR under 0.25 m/s air supply velocity are all lower than the upper limit (2.8E\u221202 s 2 ) suggested by Zhao and Wu (2005) . Based on this, if the size of the droplet nuclei is less than 10 \u03bcm (which corresponds to 30 \u03bcm initial size of the droplet from Fig. 7) , the droplet dispersion would be similar to that of gaseous contaminant. The droplets with initial size of 100 \u03bcm need 6 seconds to become the droplets nuclei with the size of 26 \u03bcm. For larger particles, the dispersion characteristics are of great difference than gaseous contaminant. Figure 8 shows the total quantity of droplets changing with time in the UVPIR. For the droplets with initial size of 100 \u03bcm and 10 \u03bcm, only 1% left in the room air after one minute. But for the gaseous contaminant, 15% of the contaminant left in the room air after one minute. Although the droplets with initial size of 10 \u03bcm and the gaseous contaminant have similar dispersion process in the UVPIR, their total quantities in the room air decay process are different. The reason is that the droplets deposit on the surfaces in the room during the transmission, not the gaseous contaminant. The quantity of the droplets with initial size of 100 \u03bcm has a rapid decrease in the first 5 seconds. The reason is that the droplets mainly disperse around the source manikin body surface in the first 10 seconds (as shown in Fig. 4) , which leads to a great chance of settling and over 10% of the droplets deposit onto the body surface. The quantity of the droplets with initial size of 10 \u03bcm also has obvious decay at the first 15 seconds, but both the amount and the rate of decay are much smaller than that of the droplets with initial size of 100 \u03bcm. For the decay process of the gaseous contaminant, the quantity of the gaseous contaminant remains unchanged at the first 10 seconds and decreases gradually after that. The total amount of the gaseous contaminant drops to 20% in 30 seconds, and the decay rate becomes quite small after that. One minute after, 15% of the gaseous contaminant remains in the room.",

From the discussions above, large droplets have larger settling velocity, so that the droplets settle out of the coughing jet quickly after coming out from mouth and cannot be carried by the coughing jet to the HTPA zone of the susceptible manikin. Hence, the larger droplets disperse mainly in the HTPA zone of the source manikin, and the droplets cross transmission between source manikin and susceptible manikin should be very small. But for small droplets/gaseous contaminants, part of them are carried by the higher velocity coughing Fig. 7 The size change with time of the droplets with different initial sizes Fig. 8 The total quantity of droplets change with time in the UVPIR Fig. 9 The schematic diagram of the dispersion process of the droplets in the UVPIR jet to the HTPA zone of the susceptible manikin and lead to cross transmission.
