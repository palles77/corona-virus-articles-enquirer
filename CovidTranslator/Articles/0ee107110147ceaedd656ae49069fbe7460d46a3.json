Nonetheless, our reported incidence of 5% is lower than the 10% to 20% incidence rates based on populations of young (,6-12 months) and/or premature infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis. 5, 6, 14, 15 It is also possible that the administration of RSV immunoprophylaxis to vulnerable populations has led to a decrease in the overall incidence of apnea.",

To our knowledge, an association between initial RR and apnea has not been previously described, and there is no clear explanation for these novel findings. Although clinicians would consider children with bronchiolitis and a RR .70 as ill, a RR of ,30 or 30-39 may be falsely reassuring.

Although the pathophysiology of apnea is unclear, Anas and colleagues 3 found that 5 infants with apnea had a higher alveolararterial gradient than 27 infants without apnea (170 vs 45 mm Hg, P , .01). Although others have not found an association between oxygenation and apnea, 6,13 we had a larger sample size and recorded oxygen saturation at both triage and throughout the preadmission visit. This methodology may have enabled us to identify this risk factor. Given that low pulse oximetry values are already used as a criterion Our virology results demonstrate that many viruses are associated with inpatient apnea during the bronchiolitis hospitalization. Multiple previous investigations of apnea associated with viral infections have focused exclusively on RSV, and several sources have perpetuated the notion that RSV specifically should heighten concerns of apnea in comparison with other viruses. 5, 24 However, according to our data, the risk of apnea does not significantly differ in infants with RSV and non-RSV bronchiolitis. These data suggest that using RSV status to drive admission decisions and admission locations (eg, ward, step-down unit, ICU) due to apnea concerns may be misguided. Supporting the lack of an association between virology and apnea is the finding that viral etiology was not linked with the acute severity of bronchiolitis (as measured by initial admission to ICU or the use of mechanical ventilation) in this same cohort. How-ever, it should be noted that we did find an association between viral etiology and hospital length of stay. 17 Exposure to various therapeutic agents (antibiotics, acetaminophen, and bronchodilators) during the week before admission appeared to have a \"protective\" association against apnea in unadjusted analyses. On multivariable analysis, however, none of these medications remained statistically significant, thereby confirming the presence of $1 confounding factors. Even though a recent study of 42 infants with apnea concluded that acetaminophen was protective against apnea, 25 we caution against using acetaminophen for this purpose; based on a much larger sample, our data do not support this inference.",
