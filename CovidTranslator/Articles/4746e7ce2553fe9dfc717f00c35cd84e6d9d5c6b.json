The increase in numbers of CD8 q cells persisted for three consecutive weeks. Serum immunoglobulins in infected pigs also increased by week 3 PI and up to 8 weeks PI.

We found in previous experiments that a double challenge one week apart with low doses of PRRSV generated a long-lasting and reproducible viraemia in infected \u017d . pigs data not shown . Our results effectively demonstrate that a long-lasting infection is consistently achieved, the infected pigs remaining viraemic for 5 to 6 consecutive weeks. As initially foreseen, all the PRRSV-infected pigs were viraemic when PRV immunizations were carried out, i.e. 14 days after the initial infection. At this time, it was assumed that the acute effects of PRRSV on the immune system of pigs had \u017d . disappeared see below . However, the virus was still present in the blood circulation, with possibly, additional incidence on the immune functions. The establishment of a persistent infection could result from the inability of the anti-viral defences to control the virus replication. In the present report, we confirmed that PRRSV is a poor and late \u017d . inducer of neutralizing antibodies see also Yoon et al., 1994 . Recently, Yoon et al. \u017d . 1996 established that virus neutralization in vivo requires a minimal titre of serum neutralizing antibodies. The log titre that efficiently neutralized the virus in vivo was estimated to be 2.8. Such a titre was achieved by a passive transfer of concentrated \u017d . PRRSV-specific IgG Yoon et al., 1996 . Since the neutralizing antibody titre in the sera \u017d . of convalescent pigs is generally lower maximum log titre was 1.49 in our study , it can be assumed that neutralization in vivo is not an effective immune response for controlling the virus infection. In contrast, low amounts of neutralizing antibodies have been shown to significantly enhance the duration and the level of viraemia in pigs or the \u017d . infection of alveolar macrophages in vitro Yoon et al., 1996 . In the present study, we have observed an increase of CD2 q and CD8 q cells at weeks 3 and 4 after PRRSV infection. Levels of CD8 q cells were still higher in PRRSV-infected pigs than in uninfected pigs, at week 5 PI. The increase of CD2 q cells is likely to be due to the increase in CD8 q cells, since the latter express both markers.",

Since PRRSV ( ) was not detected in the pig sera when the secondary anti-PRV response arose, we assume that PRRS acted, in some way, in up-regulating the degree of the primary response to PRV glycoproteins, leading subsequently to an enhanced secondary response. Although the anti-PRV antibody response and delayed type hypersensitivity were obviously not increased after PRV immunization, the concentration of serum immunoglobulins and the amount of WBC, CD2 q rCD8 q and IgM q cells were however enhanced in PRRSV-infected pigs. Therefore, it can be anticipated that PRRSV has stimulated at least one component of the immune response raised against PRV glycoproteins.

We assume that the effects of PRRSV on anti-PRV immune responses were not sufficient to provide supplementary protection against the PRV challenge. On the other hand, achievement of a better protection against this severe challenge would probably require the recruitment of other immune mechanisms such as CTLs.",

In contrast with PRRSV, PRV infection has led to pronounced effects on many immunological and clinical parameters. Our results with \u017d . PRV are in agreement with those of Page et al. 1992 . These authors demonstrated that PRV challenge resulted within 6 days in an increase of polynuclear cells and a pronounced lymphopenia. In addition, CD8 q cells and CD4rCD8 ratio decreased during the week after challenge. These alterations support a general immunosuppressive \u017d . effect of PRV, as reported elsewhere see review of Chinsakchai and Molitor, 1994 . Thus, PRV appears to be more detrimental than PRRSV for the immune system of pig. Interestingly, the incidence of PRRSV infection was similar on SPF and conventional pigs. However, total and differential WBC counts and anti-PRV antibody production were higher in conventional pigs compared to SPF pigs, whereas daily weight gains were lower. These discrepancies may result from the improved health status of SPF pigs for which the immune system is less reactive and the growth is generally better.",

The antibody production was not enhanced, immune cell distributions remained unchanged, immunization against PRV glycoproteins and subsequent disease resistance to a virulent PRV challenge was not adversely affected. Our study supports and extends previous findings which concluded that PRRSV had no effect on immune responses of pigs and subsequent disease \u017d . resistance to various microorganisms Cooper et al., 1995; Van Reeth et al., 1996b . The apparent increased disease susceptibility of PRRSV-infected pigs, as reported elsewhere \u017d . Galina et al., 1994; Van Reeth et al., 1996a , could be ascribed to the local disruption of the first lines of defence. This disruption could be due to the virus replication in ( ) alveolar macrophages and the consequent local inflammatory reaction. Recurrent secondary infections, observed in some herds, could be explained by successive phases of acute infection in new susceptible pigs, thus, facilitating the establishment, the proliferation and the dissemination of any opportunistic pathogens.",
