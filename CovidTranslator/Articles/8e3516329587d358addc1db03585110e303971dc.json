Previous investigations have shown that the MHV spike (S) protein is a critical determinant of viral tropism and pathogenicity in mice and rats. To understand the molecular basis of MHV neuropathogenesis, we studied the spike protein gene sequences of several neutralization-resistant variants of the JHM strain of MHV, which were selected with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the S protein. We found that variant 2.2-V-1, which was selected with MAb J.2.2 and primarily caused demyelination, had a single point mutation at nucleotide (NT) 3340, as compared to the parental JHM virus, which predominantly caused encephalitis. This site was in the S2 subunit of the S protein. In contrast, variant 7.2-V-1, which was selected with MAb J.7.2 and primarily caused encephalitis, had two point mutations at NT 1766 and 1950, which were in the Sl subunit. Finally, the double mutant 2.2/7.2-V-2, which was selected with both MAbs J.2.2 and 1.7.2, and was attenuated with respect to both virulence and the ability to cause demyelination, had a deletion spanning from NT 1523 to 1624 in the Sl and a point mutation at NT 3340 in the S2. We conclude that at least two regions of the S protein contribute to neuropathogenicity of MHV. We have also isolated a partial revertant of 2.2-V-1, which was partially resistant to MAb J.2.2 but retained the same neuropathogenicity as the variant 2.2-V-l. This revertant retained the mutation at NT 3340, but had a second-site mutation at NT 1994, further confirming that NT 3340 contributed to the pathogenic phenotype of MHV. By comparing these results with MHV variants isolated in other laboratories, which had mutations in other sites on the S gene and yet retained the demyelinating ability, we suggest that the ability of JHM viruses to induce demyelination is determined by the interaction of multiple sites on the S gene, rather than the characteristics of a single, unique site. Our study also revealed the possible presence of microheterogeneitv of S gene sequence, particularly in the Sl region, in these viruses. The sequence microheterogeneity may also _ contribute to the differences in their biological properties.",

            "text": "The S protein is cleaved into two 90-kDa glycoprotein subunits (Sl and S2). Its cleavage is carried out by a cellular protease and is probably required for the virusinduced cell fusion (Storz et a/., 1981; Yoshikura and Tajima, 1981; Sturman et al., 1985) . The S protein is translated from mRNA 3, which represents the transcript of the 4.2-kb gene (S gene), located at roughly 6-10 kb from the 3'-end of the RNA genome (Lai, 1990) . The complete sequence of the S gene has been reported for three strains of MHV, namely, A59 (Luytjes et a/., 1987) JHM (Schmidt et a/., 1987) , and MHV-4 (equivalent to JHM used in our laboratory) (Parker et a/., 1989 ). It appears that the S gene sequences of different MHV strains differ significantly, with various degrees of deletion and substitutions. Infection of the central nervous system (CNS) of rodents by MHV, particularly the JHM strain, has been used as a model system for studying human demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Parental JHM strain shows tropism for both neurons and glial cells, causing both encephalitis and chronic demyelination (Weiner, 1973) . The tropism of MHV is mainly determined by the properties of the S protein, since it is the outermost component of the viral envelope, which interacts with the cellular receptors, and it is also the immunodominant component which interacts with the host immune system (Sturman and Holmes, 1983) . The role of the other structural proteins in viral pathogenesis is less well understood; passive immunization with MAbs specific for N and M (membrane) proteins also changed viral pathogenicity (Fleming et a/., 1989; Nakanaga et a/., 1986) .",

While the parental virus caused encephalitis, the variants selected with one neutralizing MAb (J.2.2) had lower virulence and caused demyelination, and the variants selected with two MAbs (J.2.2 and 1.7.2) caused neither encephalitis nor demyelination (Fleming et al., 1986 (Fleming et al., , 1987 . Based on these studies, we hypothesized that MAb J.2.2 identified a specific encephalitis-determining site and MAb J.7.2 identified a specificdemyelination-determining site on the S protein. Alternatively, we considered the possibility that a single linear determinant might not be the necessary and sufficient cause of JHM-induced demyelination, and that demyelination would depend on several regions of S or even on other viral genes (Fleming et a/., 1987) . Our present sequence analysis indicates that the latter hypothesis is correct; that is, the neuropathogenicity of JHM depends on the characteristics of at least two sites on the S gene.

Since we were dealing with several viral isolates with presumably only minor differences in S gene, crosscontamination was a major concern. To avoid this problem, whenever possible, different pairs of primers were used in the cloning of different viral RNAs so that distinguishable gene fragments were obtained for each viral isolate. In cases where alternative primers were not available, new aliquots of reagents were used for each isolate. Another concern was that the enzymes used, namely, reverse transcriptase, Taq polymerase, and Sequenase may generate errors. To avoid this problem, clones from different cDNA synthesis events, different PCR events, and multiple clones were sequenced. For each isolate, the full-length sequence was initially obtained from two different DNA clones. Differences in sequence identified by this initial sequencing were further studied by sequencing more clones. Only consistent changes were considered as bona fide mutations.

To our surprise, 7.2-V-l did not have a deletion. Instead, there were two point mutations consistently detected downstream of the 2.2/ 7.2-V-2 deletion site, one at NT 1766, changing the codon from TCA to TTA (Ser to Leu) and the other one at NT 1950, changing the codon from AAG to AAT (Lys to Asn). All of these changes were localized around the hypetvariable region (de Groot et al., 1987; Parker et a/., 1989; Banner et a/., 1990) of the S protein. These results suggested that the mutations, including deletions and point mutations, in this region were most likely responsible for the viral resistance to MAb J.7.2. NT 3340 of 7.2-V-l remained as CTC, similar to that in JHM-DL, consistent with the fact that 7.2-V-l was directly derived from JHM-DL.",

Variant 2.2-V-l was passaged in DBT cells in the absence of any MAb, and viruses were randomly selected from plaques. Since the parental JHM-DL grew better than the neutralization-resistant variants (unpublished observations), we reasoned that the revertants would become a predominant population during serial viral passages in the absence of selection pressure. Indeed, most of the plaque-purified viruses isolated this way were partially sensitive to MAb J.2.2 (data not shown). Their titers were reduced by MAb J.2.2 by approximately 2.7 log,,,. However, none of the viruses examined (N = 7) completely reverted to the level seen in parental JHM-DL, whose titer was reduced by MAb J.2.2 by approximately 4 loglo (Fleming et al., 1986 (Fleming et al., , 1987 . Sequence analysis of multiple clones from all seven partial revertants showed that all of them have retained the sequence of 2.2-V-l at NT 3340, which was the only consistent difference observed between JHM-DL and 2.2-V-l. One of these revertants was chosen for complete sequencing; this virus had a consistent change at a second site at NT 1994, changing the codon from AAT (Asn) to AGT (Ser). Since none of the revertants completely restored the phenotype to that of the parental JHM-DL, the most logical explanation was that different regions of the S protein may cooperate to contribute to the resistance of the virus to neutralization by MAb J.2.2. The finding that NT 3340 mutation was retained in all of the partial revet-tants suggested that this site had a major contribution to the resistance to MAb J.2.2. Preliminary viral pathogenicity study by intracerebral inoculation in mice revealed that VlO had an LD,, of approximately 1 O3 PFU, similar to that of 2.2-V-1, but in contrast to JHM-DL, which had an LD,, of 4 PFU (Table 1) (Fleming et a/., 1986) . Similar to 2.2-V-1, the partially revertant virus primarily caused demyelination with little encephalitis. These results suggested that the second site mutation in the Sl region did not alter the pathogenicity of the virus and that the mutation at NT 3340 was most responsible for the neuropathogenicity of the JHM viruses.",

By contrast, when MAb J.7.2 was used to select mutants, point mutations or a deletion in Sl within NT 1500-l 950 were observed. Previous attempts at mapping the binding sites of these MAbs have failed (Weismiller eta/., 1990). Our study suggested that MAb J.7.2 would bind to Sl while MAb J.2.2 would bind to S2. These findings are consistent with a recent study measuring the direct binding of the MHV-specific MAb, which also indicated that J.2.2 bound to S2 (P. Talbot, personal communication). The binding site of J.2.2 is close to other 52 neutralizing epitopes identified in other laboratories (Luytjes et al., 1989; Routledge et al., 1991) . Interestingly, the mutation at NT 3340, which changed the coded amino acid from leu to phe affected one of the three amino acids which are critical for the fusion function of the S protein (Gallagher et al., 1991) . However, the variant 2.2-V-l induced fusion when grown on DBT cells (data not shown); this was expected since the loss of the fusion activity required the simultaneous mutations of all the three amino acids (Gallagher er al., 199 1) . Nevertheless, these findings show that this amino acid plays an important role in both fusion activity and neuropathogenicity of MHV. The region of Sl with deletion or point mutations in 2.2/7.2-V-2 or 7.2-V-l mutants corresponds to a previously identified hypervariable site on Sl (Parker et a/., 1989; Banner et a/., 1990) . This site underwent frequent deletions or point mutations upon viral passages in tissue culture or animals (Dalziel eta/., 1986; Banner et a/., 1990; Gallagher et a/., 1990) . Although the precise sites of deletion or point mutations were different among these variants, they were in the same general area, i.e., near the C-terminus of Sl Previously, Buchmeier's laboratory also has reported different types of mutation among the neutralization-escape MHV-4 variants, which were derived by use of a monoclonal antibody different from the one used in our study (Parker er a/., 1989; Gallagher et al., 1990) . All of these variants have either deletion or point mutations in this area of Sl These results together suggested that this region represented an immunodominant and highly variable site, although the binding site of MAb J.7.2 has not been directly determined.",

This result was consistent with the interpretation that the site on Sl was tightly associated with demyelination, while the site on S2 was responsible for encephalitis. However, this interpretation is unlikely, since other neutralization-resistant mutants with deletions in the same domain of Sl still caused demyelination (Dalziel et al., 1986; Gallagher et a/., 1990) . Thus, we hypothesize that the virtual inability of 2.217.2-V-2 to cause demyelination or encephalitis (Fleming et a/., 1987) was due to viral attenuation that occurred when both the Sl and S2 determinants were lost or mutated. Such an interpretation is consistent with the finding that the mutation in S2 of the variant 2.2-V-l and the mutation in Sl of other mutants (Dalziel et al., 1986) all led to a similar demyelinating phenotype. This is also consistent with our current understanding of the biological activities of the S protein.",

After intracerebral inoculation, parental JHM-DL rapidly gains entry to glia and neurons throughout the CNS and thus is able to cause fatal panencephalitis (Weiner, 1973; Knobler et a/., 1981) . By contrast, MAb-selected JHM mutants (2.2-V-1 and 2.2/7.2-V-2) are less able to spread to neurons, and virulence is thus drastically reduced (Fleming et a/,, 1986) . However, these viruses are able to infect glial cells of the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. Presumably the requirements of viral entry or replication in glial cells are less stringent than those for neuronal infection. This differential entry may reflect the presence of different receptors utilized by wild-type virus versus selected variants. In addition, the susceptibility of different neural cells to JHM is known to be affected by the developmental stages of different cell species and host factors (Pasick and Dales, 1991) . In the case of infection by JHM mutants, the immune response clears virus from the white matter by 12 days postinoculation but has the deleterious consequence of inducing myelin loss (Wang eT al., 1990) . Thus, the apparent increase in ability to cause demyelination shown by these and similar variants (Dalziel et a/., 1986; Wege et a/., 1988) is probably due to the unmasking of potentialities of the parental virus which are usually hidden by its virulence.",

The second site mutation which partially restored the MAb sensitivity of this virus was localized on Sl, in contrast to the original mutation on S2. This study suggested that two sterically separated sites (one in the globular portion, and the other in the heptad repeat region of the stalk portion according to the computer modeling [de Groot et al., 19871) on the two different S subunits could interact with each other. This effect has also been illustrated by the antibody sensitivity of 2.2/7.2-V-2 and 2.2-V-l. The former was roughly one loglo more resistant than the latter to MAb J.2.2 (Fleming eta/., 1987) , suggesting that the second mutation further altered the conformation at the first site (in S2). Interestingly, the partial revertant of 2.2-V-l retained the same pathogenic properties of the parent variant 2.2-V-l. Furthermore, 7.2-V-l variant retained the ability to cause encephalitis (Table 1) . These results suggest that the antibody binding and pathogenic properties of the S protein can be dissociated.",

            "text": "Our study also suggested the possible presence of sequence microheterogeneity in the MHVs (Table 3 and data not shown). All of these viruses were initially plaque-purified but had been amplified by limited passages to obtain sufficient virus titer before molecular cloning and sequencing. Some of these sequence variations were likely the results of PCR and cloning errors. However, several nucleotide variations were consis-tently noted in repeated PCR products. Furthermore, the sequence microheterogeneity was located mostly in the Sl hypervariable region (Banner et a/., 1990; de Groot et a/., 1987) , suggesting that the observed sequence variations represented variations in the RNA. Since the plaque-purified viruses need to be propagated for either biochemical or pathogenicity studies, this sequence microheterogeneity is likely an inherent property of any virus population. The possible contribution of the sequence microheterogeneity to viral neuropathogenicity is not clear at the present time. In conclusion, our studies suggest that at least two regions of the S gene play critical roles in JHM neuropathogenesis. These regions are near NT 1500-l 950 (Sl segment) and NT 3340 (S2 segment). Antigenic studies indicate that these sites may be closely linked on the S protein and may influence each other by spatial proximity or steric effects (Fleming et al., 1986) . Viruses with the parental JHM sequences may infect all cell types and regions of the CNS, resulting in fatal panencephalitis. When either site is altered, viral infection is limited to glial cells of the white matter, and subsequent immune attack (Wang et al., 1990) or virus-induced cytolysis will lead to demyelination. When both sites are affected, the virus shows very limited distribution and presumably is contained by the immune system at an early stage of pathogenesis. It is probable that other S domains may also contribute to the viral pathogenicity. In addition, although the S gene is considered to be the most important in influencing pathogenicity, other viral genes such as hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) (La Monica et a/., 1991, Yokomori et al., 1991) and those localized to the 3' portion of the genome (Lavi et a/., 1990) may also, to some extent, contribute to viral pathogenicity.",
