In a previously reported family cluster, most infected individuals had clinical symptoms, decreased lymphocyte counts, and abnormal chest CT images, and were positive for the virus on quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. 2,3 However, some of the family members had abnormal chest CT images and positive qRT-PCR results without any clinical symptoms. 3 Here, we report the clinical characteristics of a family cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this family of three, one 35-year-old man (patient 1) had clinical symptoms, a decreased lymphocyte count, abnormal chest CT images, and a positive result on qRT-PCR. By contrast, the other two family members-a 33-year-old woman (patient 2) and a 3-year-old boy (patient 3)-were both asymptomatic, with normal lymphocyte counts and chest CT images but positive qRT-PCR results (figure).",
