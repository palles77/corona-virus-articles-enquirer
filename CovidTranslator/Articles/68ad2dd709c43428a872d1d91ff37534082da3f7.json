Currently available SimEx materials lack an integrated health system perspective and have a limited focus on the quality of services delivered within the context of response to a public health emergency. to disease outbreaks. 1 Health workers were significantly more likely to be infected than the general population, with this increased risk largely attributable to the poor quality of infection prevention and control (IPC) practices and emergency preparedness. [1] [2] [3] Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone lost between 1.5% and 8.1% of their country's doctors, nurses and midwives to EVD, translating into significant reductions in the healthcare provision. 2 Ineffective surveillance systems enabled EVD to spread locally as well as across borders. 4 5 During an outbreak, as with any public health emergency (PHE), the resilience of a country's health system is tested in real time. The capacity to respond to an outbreak and maintain essential services creates a surge in demand for critical resources. Health system resilience has been defined as 'the capacity of health actors, institutions, and populations to prepare for and effectively respond to crises; maintain core functions when a crisis hits; and, informed by lessons learned during the crisis, reorganize if conditions require it.' 4 Resilient health systems protect human life and are linked with positive health outcomes during a PHE as well as in its aftermath. 4 A lack of health system resilience is associated with excess morbidity and mortality due to the PHE as well as from other causes, which can be at least partially attributed to a reduction in access to quality health services. [6] [7] [8] It has been estimated that a 50% reduction in access to healthcare services during the West African EVD resulted in increased child and maternal mortality as well as increased mortality from other infectious diseases. 6 8 These indirect deaths-10 623-were not insignificant. 6 Thus, it is critical that a mechanism exists to test and build resilient health systems in order to reduce excess morbidity and mortality from future PHEs.",

A limited number were identified that tested aspects of health system resilience or recovery (figure 2).

A few materials self-identified as testing health security or testing for contingency, and so warranted extra categories. The materials identified looked at aspects of health security across different geographical levels (international, national, regional and facility); they more frequently examined the regional/ district (43%) and facility levels (31.4%) ( figure 3) .

IPC was the most commonly tested service delivery function with adherence to case management guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOP) being a frequent focus of testing. 8 The quality of health services provided in the context of the response or measures of the maintenance of essential health services were lacking. Surge capacity was the most frequently tested function of health workforce, though a narrow approach was often apparent. Exercises tested aspects of surge capacity such as staffing, however, this was not addressed within other building blocks in relation to the invariable increased demands on services and supplies. A narrow approach to health information systems was also apparent, with three materials (out of 51) focusing on surveillance systems and only limited aspects of risk communication tested. Only one identified material tested the triggering of a response plan using a surveillance system. 12 Leadership and governance (from a security perspective) was the most frequently addressed building block, with many materials testing aspects of this building block such as response plans and roles and responsibilities of responders. However, alignment with national structures and guidelines was not apparent, nor was consideration given to decision in risk identification. While access to medicines and supplies was frequently alluded to, testing of access to mechanisms or supply chain resilience was infrequent. Financing was alluded to in only 17% of materials (n=51), but testing of mechanisms to access funding in the event of PHEs was not identified.",

Most materials tested activation of appropriate emergency response mechanisms and structures within the respective administrative levels tested, for example, a facility-level exercise testing activation of all appropriate response mechanisms within the health facility. Some materials tested activation across different levels within the system, for example, a health facility responding to an outbreak activating regional or national response systems. Emergency response systems were generally assumed to have been activated, without testing system triggering. As was apparent with the building block analysis, healthcare functions were generally not tested in an integrated way. For example, a mass dispensing drill had no regard for the parallel response structures with which they would have to integrate during a response. 13 Similarly, a facility response to a sarin attack failed to integrate with national response agencies. 13 14 Reporting of alignment with national command and control structures or response plans was limited as was evidence of consideration of the impact of the PHE on other health system-level facilities or management structures. Materials to test the impact of emergencies on primary healthcare (PHC) or its response were extremely limited and community resilience materials, where identified, failed to link with health systems. [15] [16] [17] The materials were limited in their focus on testing the quality of services delivered in the context of response to a PHE. Where present, measures tended to focus on clinical aspects of care rather than system and process measures. Measures to test the maintenance of essential services from a quality perspective were not identified in any of the eight selected materials.",

In reality, it is the same health system that provides routine healthcare, emergency-specific healthcare and response to a shock impacting public health.

Similarly, the approach to the analyses conducted required sufficient detail in the identified materials in relation to exercises or objectives, which led to the exclusion of a number of relevant materials as they were not present either with sufficient details or as a package (written narrative, scenario, injects and postexercise report). Both the academic literature and institutional materials were analysed using the same approach.

Despite evidence from EVD West Africa that community linkages can support health system response in the face of PHEs, the current global pool of SimEx materials were unlikely to link with community aspects and where community preparedness materials existed they rarely linked with health systems. 16 17 The importance of integrating private healthcare facilities into emergency preparedness and response capabilities was highlighted by the recent dengue outbreak in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2017. A private health facility, unfamiliar with emergency response protocols, failed to activate emergency response mechanisms in a timely manner.
