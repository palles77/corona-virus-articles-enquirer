Understanding the importance of respiratory viruses in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been limited because of challenges using clinic-or hospital-based diagnostic testing. We conducted a pilot study to assess feasibility of home self-(or parent-) collection of nasal swabs (NS). Methods. Cystic fibrosis patients aged 6-18 years with new respiratory illness participated. In clinic, a deep nasal flocked swab was collected by research staff and compared with an anterior foam NS obtained after instillation of saline spray. At home, up to 2 self-collections of paired foam NS (with and without saline) were collected and mailed for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Results. Paired swabs were collected from 28 patients: 18 sets in clinic (deep nasal vs saline foam NS) and 43 sets at home (saline vs dry foam NS) with 9 (50%) and 35 (81%) virus detections, respectively. Home-collected NS were obtained closer to illness onset, with a mean difference in symptom days of \u22122.3 between home and clinic collections (95% confidence interval [CI] \u22123.5, \u22121.2; P < .001). Rhinovirus comprised 73% of virus detections; the difference in mean PCR cycle threshold values for rhinovirus between swabs collected at home versus clinic was \u22123.8 (95% CI \u22126.8, \u22120.9; P = .014), indicating significantly higher viral load for homecollected swabs. Conclusions. Home-collected foam NS had a higher positivity rate compared with clinic-collected swabs, likely because collection was closer to illness onset. Home self-collection is feasible and well tolerated for timely respiratory virus diagnosis and provides a novel approach for clinical diagnostics and surveillance of respiratory virus infections among CF patients.",

In children, nasal swabs (NS) have been shown to have reasonable performance for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of most respiratory viruses [15] [16] [17] [18] . Communitybased studies have used parent-or self-collected swabs for respiratory virus research [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Although previous studies using self-collection have involved transport medium a and storage at 4\u00b0C, we have recently developed a simple, sensitive, and noninvasive method for self-collection of respiratory samples using foam swabs that does not require transport media or refrigeration [25] . Furthermore, we found that swabs collected with the use of saline spray were superior to swabs collected without the use of saline spray [25] . In the current study, we investigated the feasibility of home self-collection of NS in children with CF experiencing onset of new respiratory illness, with samples mailed to a central laboratory for respiratory virus detection by real-time PCR. Although the main objective was to assess feasibility, we also sought to study whether NS collected at home would compare favorably to swabs collected in clinic for detection of respiratory viruses, and whether foam NS collected with the use of saline spray would perform comparably to swabs collected without saline.",

This approach to using nasopharyngeal swabs to collect deep nasal samples was previously found to be well accepted by participants in a study of respiratory viruses in CF patients at our hospital [2] . Next, a polyurethane foam NS (Super Brush, LLC, Chicopee, MA; catalog No. 71-4541) was collected in the opposite naris after instillation of saline nasal spray. Nasal spray was used to closely replicate a standard nasal wash. In brief, 5 sprays of saline from a polyethylene metered bottle (0.1 mL/spray) were instilled into the naris, followed by NS insertion into the anterior naris as far as comfortably possible, and rotation of the swab while exhaling through the nose for 5-7 seconds. During the clinic visit, the research nurse instructed the patient regarding self-collection of foam NS, and either the patient or parent collected the swab while observed and directed by the research nurse, or the swab was collected by the research nurse as an opportunity to demonstrate the proper technique for collection to the patient and parent. Detailed written instructions regarding self-collection were reviewed at the clinic visit and were provided to the family for reference when swab collection at home was indicated (see Supplementary Material). Also provided were kits containing all supplies necessary for collection and mailing of foam NS to be obtained at home at onset of symptoms of a new respiratory illness. Subsequent collections at home consisted of foam NS collected either by the participant or parent with (\"saline\") and without (\"dry\") the use of nasal saline spray to evaluate whether the spray was essential to the procedure, as previously described [25] . Dry swabs were collected by inserting a foam swab into the anterior naris as far as comfortably possible, followed by slow rotation of the swab for 5-7 seconds while exhaling through the nose. For home collections, participants were asked to collect the dry swab before the saline swab.",

            "text": "Because of the small sample size of our study and limited diversity of virus types identified, we are unable to make conclusions regarding the sensitivity of the various swab methods used for collection, especially for viruses other than rhinovirus. The high proportion of swabs positive for rhinovirus may simply reflect the high frequency of rhinoviruses detected in nonmedically attended acute respiratory illness. However, it is important to note that the home-collected swabs did detect a variety of important respiratory viruses, in addition to rhinovirus. Although it is has been documented that children with CF shed respiratory viruses even in the absence of symptoms [2, 8, 14] , the increased detection of viruses in home-collected samples in the setting of new respiratory illness suggests that this method is useful to detect incident viral infections.",

            "text": "Because the majority of the virus detections were rhinovirus, and because the more than 100 rhinovirus serotypes do not amplify with the same efficiency using our RT-PCR assay, quantitative RT-PCR testing was not performed. Using RT-PCR C T values as a semiquantitative evaluation of viral load for rhinoviruses detected, we found a difference in viral load between swabs collected in clinic versus home. The nearly 3.8 C T difference between mean C T values likely represents at least a 10-fold greater viral load in home-collected compared with clinic-collected swabs. In summary, these results provide a unique method for larger studies of respiratory virus shedding and transmission among children with CF. Studies involving home self-collection of respiratory samples will provide more accurate data on the incidence of respiratory virus infections among children with CF and will help to elucidate the role of viral infections in chronic bacterial colonization and pulmonary function decline in CF lung disease. Because CF patients are generally followed at quarterly clinic visits, home sample collection could provide critical interim data regarding respiratory virus infections that might otherwise go undocumented. Home collection of samples could also prove useful for clinical management of patients with CF, providing more prompt recognition of these infections and potentially decreasing unnecessary or prolonged antibiotic use. Thus, we recommend this approach for future studies of respiratory illness and pulmonary exacerbations in patients with CF.",
