It was further observed that asthmatics admitted to hospital with influenza infection were less likely to die or require admission to intensive care compared with nonasthmatics [6, 8, 9] . In contrast, the presence of virtually all other chronic medical conditions was associated with an increased risk of death following hospitalisation [9] . The reasons why a diagnosis of asthma should be associated with less severe outcomes in hospitalised patients have not been examined. Possible explanations suggested include: 1) a lower threshold for hospital referral and admission, hence a milder illness at time of admission compared with nonasthmatics; 2) the occurrence of treatable influenza-induced exacerbations of asthma rather than influenza-related pneumonia prompting admission; and 3) the tendency for asthma to be the dominant risk factor in younger age groups in whom the case-fatality rate due to influenza is lower [9, 10] . Network (FLU-CIN) to undertake clinical surveillance of hospitalised cases of H1N1pdm infection. The aim of this study was to provide rapid information on the admission of cases to hospital and to improve the management of influenza. We used the abundant information from this study to examine the risk factors and outcomes of persons with asthma.",

Patients with ''severe outcomes'' constituted ''cases''. Potential confounding variables in the multivariable logistic regression were identified from both our previous work investigating risk factors for severe outcomes in the same cohort [11] and an a priori conceptual framework based on the descriptive analyses. The effect of the following covariates on the relationship between asthma and severe outcomes was independently assessed by introducing them separately, in turn, into the original model: age; comorbidities (using the Charlson index, excluding asthma cases) [14] ; immune compromise; season of admission; severity of illness at admission (severe respiratory distress; increased respiratory rate; oxygen saturation f92%; respiratory exhaustion; severe clinical dehydration or shock; altered consciousness; dyspnoea and C-reactive protein levels); pre-admission inhaled steroid use; time to hospital admission (from symptom onset); in-hospital antiviral use; in-hospital antibiotic use; and inhospital oral/intravenous corticosteroid use. Any covariate that modified the original unadjusted odds ratio by at least 10% towards a null association was then included in the final multivariable logistic regression model. If the association of asthma with less severe outcomes was fully explained by associated comorbidities or treatments, then the adjusted odds ratio of asthma with severe outcomes would be expected to approximate one in the final multivariate model.",

Instead, the proportions of patients with radiologically confirmed pneumonia were very similar in asthmatics and nonasthmatics (17% versus 16.6%). In addition, compared with nonasthmatics, asthmatics had features indicative of greater respiratory compromise at the time of hospital admission; the latter being reflected in higher rates of dyspnoea, severe respiratory distress, respiratory exhaustion, oxygen saturations f92% and need for supplemental oxygen.

However, the lack of peak flow data would not have affected the main analysis comparing asthmatics versus nonasthmatics. The effect of comorbidities on the association of asthma with severe outcomes was adjusted for using the Deyo adaptation of the Charlson index score, which is a weighted measure using International Classifiaction of Diseases-10 classification. However, no comorbidity score is perfect and residual confounding cannot be completely excluded in this observational dataset. Data on time from symptom onset to hospital admission were available in 1,083 (71.3%) patients. There was no systematic reason for missing data and patients with missing data were similar to other patients. Therefore, given the overall size of the FLU-CIN cohort and the strength of the associations examined, it is unlikely that the missing data resulted in significantly altered results. Pandemic influenza vaccination status was not reliably recorded in the medical notes for all patients in the FLU-CIN cohort. Asthmatics, being in the target group for vaccination in the UK, may have been more likely to have been vaccinated compared with nonasthmatics. As all patients in this study had laboratory-confirmed H1N1pdm infection, if any patient had received the pandemic influenza vaccination, it had not prevented occurrence of infection. The possibility that vaccination of asthmatics may have attenuated the severity of illness remains. However, patients with other comorbid illnesses (who would have been equally likely to receive early vaccination) were not observed to have fewer severe outcomes, as had asthmatics. Therefore, a protective effect from pandemic influenza vaccination is unlikely to explain the findings of the current study.",

The veracity of this view could not be explored within the current dataset. Patients with other chronic respiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, typically managed with inhaled and systemic steroids and were not observed to have a lower likelihood of severe outcomes. This may reflect differences in the degree of response to treatment according to severity and chronicity of underlying lung disease, with asthma generally being more responsive than other chronic lung diseases [17] . The association between inhaled corticosteroid use in asthmatics and improved clinical outcomes is supported by findings from large epidemiological studies. Using the Saskatchewan Health databases and a cohort of 30 569 asthmatics, SUISSA et al. [18] demonstrated that regular use of low-dose inhaled steroids was associated with a decreased risk of death from asthma and with reductions of 31% in the rate of hospital admissions for asthma [19] . Likewise, low adherence rates to asthma medication, particularly inhaled corticosteroids, are associated with poorer asthma outcomes [20, 21] . The benefits from inhaled corticosteroids are thought to relate to their effects on airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness and are not specific to any particular viral infection. Thus, although the current study focused on H1N1pdm infection, the observed benefit from inhaled corticosteroids on clinical outcomes in asthmatics would probably extend to other acute respiratory viral infections.",

            "text": "The relationship between asthma, in-hospital systemic corticosteroid use and clinical outcomes is more complicated. Some cohort studies of critically ill patients with H1N1pdm infection have reported an association of systemic corticosteroids with higher mortality or higher rates of hospital-acquired pneumonia [22] [23] [24] , while other studies have not identified any association between systemic corticosteroid use and severe outcomes [25] . None of these studies differentiated between asthmatics and nonasthmatics. In the current study, systemic corticosteroids were associated with a lower likelihood of severe outcomes in asthmatics, while in nonasthmatics, there was an association with an increased likelihood of severe outcomes. This reflects the substantially different indications for administration of systemic corticosteroids in asthmatics compared with nonasthmatics. The benefit of systemic corticosteroids in the acute management of exacerbations of asthma is well described and rests on a large evidence base [26] . The findings from this study support the principles of acute asthma management, including the use of systemic corticosteroids for asthmatics hospitalised with influenza infection. In contradistinction, for nonasthmatics, the role of systemic corticosteroids in the management of severe influenza infections remains unclear and may even be harmful [27, 28] . In this study, corticosteroid use in nonasthmatics may have been more frequent in severely ill cases and, therefore, its use may merely be a marker for severe disease. However, this explanation alone does not account for the finding by HAN et al. [24] that patients with H1N1pdm infection who were treated prospectively with corticosteroids as a fever suppressant suffered worse outcomes. An adequately powered randomised controlled trial is required to inform the current debate, taking into account the possibility that different clinical groups may have different types of disease and may either benefit from or be harmed by steroid therapy.",

Pre-admission use of inhaled corticosteroids and earlier admission to hospital (within 4 days) explained most of the observed association of asthma with less severe outcomes. This is consistent with the interpretation that a proportion of asthmatics, compared with nonasthmatics, were admitted because of a condition triggered by viral infection (i.e. virusinduced asthma exacerbation) rather than because of the severity of the infection itself and for which hospital treatment was more effective.",
