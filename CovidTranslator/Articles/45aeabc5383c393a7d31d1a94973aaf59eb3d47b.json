They are considered the most economically important respiratory viral diseases, and they threaten the poultry industry worldwide [1] . Mixed infection or co-infection with AIV and IBV has been described as a natural infection in different countries in Asia and the Middle-East [2, 3] . More, the IBV vaccine is used extensively in chicken farms in many countries worldwide where both IBV and low pathogenic AIV H9N2 are endemic [3, 4] . The H120 strain of IBV was one of the earliest live attenuated IBV vaccines to be developed and has continued to be use in most parts of the world. As with any live-attenuated IBV vaccine, the H120 vaccine strains must replicate in the respiratory tract if they are to stimulate protective immunity. It follows, therefore, that some damage to the epithelial layer of the respiratory tract will occur and a fine balance must be achieved between a strain that is so over-attenuated that it is unable to replicate sufficiently to stimulate immunity and one that is insufficiently attenuated so that serious damage may occur. The H120 virus meets these criteria well and is ideally suited for use in young, susceptible chicks [5] .",

They likely compete to infect target cells and replicate. It has been shown that many viruses require the presence of well defined cell surface proteins for cell entry. The cell surface receptor for AIV or IBV on the cell surface is the N-acetyl neuraminic acid (\u03b12,3-sialic acid-galactose) [6] . Such cell receptor also serves as a receptor protein determinant for primary attachment of group 3 corona viruses [7] , allowing fusion events and entry of both viruses. Huang et al. have described as it is unknown whether co-infections with AIV and IBV exacerbate clinical signs of the disease in infected birds or produce viral interference, masking infections by either virus [8] , even though it is reported that co-infection of IBV with AIV increased not only the severity of AIV-H9N2 clinical sings and gross lesions, but also the mortality rate with extended viral shedding period of AIV [9] [10] [11] .",

Indeed, infection of animals with AIV and IBV, following simultaneous, super-infection or vaccination, may lead to severe complications having bad effect on the animal health and the farmer expenses. Mixed infection of poultry with AIV and IBV induced complex clinical picture making identification and diagnosis of either one or both viruses' difficult [12, 22] . Still, questions remain regarding potential interactions between these viruses in co-infected bird [8] . So, it is worthy to better understand the in vivo interactions between these viruses for an efficacious disease control by adapting the vaccination programs (Kelli et al., 2010) .",

However, our study showed that the majority of chicks simultaneously infected with AIV (A/CK/TUN/145/12)-H9N2 and IBV-H120, did not show clear clinical signs, indicating low viral growth.

A significant lower amounts of viral gene copy numbers were then noted at 7dpi up to 20dpi, in either TC or CL swabs (p < 0.05), collected from simultaneously (Figs. [2] [3] [4] [5] . It can be inferred that the transitory inhibition of viral replication may have an effect on the severity of the disease; the induced clinical signs were not perceptible and only microscopic lesions were noticed.

They are consistent with previous study showing that AIV viral shedding happens mainly by the TC route (Costa-Hurtado, 2014). In addition, virus shedding was lower in all groups simultaneously or sequentially treated, as compared to single infected animals. Previous in vitro or in ovo experiments have shown similar results, in which simultaneous infections with a mixture of AIV and IBV induced inhibition of the replication of both viruses during the first 3 days of infection. In fact, using cell cultures or chicken embryos, co-infections with AIV and (Newcastle disease virus) NDV mixture have shown interference between both viruses, suggesting inhibition of the growth of one virus by the other [22] [23] [24] . Such early inhibition may be related to competition for virus receptors on the cell surface, leading to an attachment interference phenomenon. Interference could also be due to intracellular interference related to competition for replication sites or essential factors for viral replication, virus-induced interferon interference or ARN or defective interfering particles [25] .",
