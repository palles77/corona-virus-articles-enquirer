Here we examine assembly of virus capsids, focusing on hepatitis B virus and bacteriophage MS2, and formation of glycoproteins in the alphaviruses. These systems are structurally and biochemically well-characterized and are simplest-case paradigms of self-assembly. Published data suggest that capsid and glycoprotein assembly is subject to allosteric regulation, that is, regulation at the level of conformational change. The hypothesis that allostery is a common theme in viruses suggests that deregulation of capsid and glycoprotein assembly by small molecule effectors will be an attractive antiviral strategy, as has been demonstrated with hepatitis B virus.",

Many small viruses also have lipid envelopes studded with glycoproteins that can facilitate cell entry. Even a small virus is complex, yet its formation is a canonical example of self-assembly. Given the right conditions, the capsid proteins of many viruses will assemble to capsid-like structures, rapidly, in high yield, and with high fidelity (Table 1 ). This observation opens up two distinct fields of study: the process of self-assembly and regulation of assembly. The process of self-assembly is best described by physical chemistry; for example, self-assembly can be modeled by a system of differential equations or emulated with small molecules. Regulating assembly, on the other hand, is fundamentally biochemical and ultimately biological in nature. Consider our hypothetical virus where unregulated assembly would yield capsids that did not contain the viral genome and toxic accumulation of fusion protein. These spontaneous assembly reactions must be delayed until the right time and place. Regulation is likely to be at the level of allostery, which is defined as a conformational change in a molecule, usually a protein, that alters its activity, induced by an effector molecule. In addition to allostery, regulation could require viral or host factors. Regulation of the large event of virus assembly by a small reaction, such as inducing conformational change of a single protein, provides the leverage that allows virus replication in vivo. Disruption of regulation is an ideal target for antiviral therapeutics. Defining the regulation that directly controls the physical chemistry of assembly is a field in its infancy and the focus of this review.",

Both the capsid and glycoprotein are protein oligomers; from a physical-chemical perspective, their assembly is similar; from a biological perspective they demonstrably have similar elements of regulation. Though there are numerous experimental systems (Tables 1 and 2) , the discussion of capsid assembly will focus on hepatitis B virus (HBV) with significant references to retroviruses and bacteriophage MS2. Furthermore, small molecules that dramatically affect HBV assembly have demonstrable antiviral activity. The discussion on glycoprotein assembly will focus on the formation of the spike complex of alphaviruses as the spike is composed of two proteins which intricately interact and are required for viral entry. Finally, we will discuss potential steps in assembly that could be targeted for designing antiviral therapeutics.",

First, weak interactions are necessary to minimize errors and kinetic traps. Weak interactions also contribute to a defined nucleation step. Second, nucleation minimizes the initiation of assembly, decreasing kinetic trapping of intermediates due to depletion of AUs. Third, the initial kinetic phase where there is little capsid formation is due to the time required to build the steady state of intermediates that supports subsequent assembly.

Assembly of a concentration series of HBV core protein (left) compared to assembly simulations of a 30-mer model (right), where subunits have an HBV-like geometry and the nucleus is trimeric 1 . The protein concentration increases from 4 \u03bcM (red) to 10 \u03bcM (purple) in 1 \u03bcM increments. The calculation is parametrized to resemble HBV assembly. For the simulation, the bimolecular rates for nucleation (k nuc ) and elongation (K elong ) were 70 M \u22121 s \u22121 and a diffusion-limited 10 5 M \u22121 s \u22121 , respectively; the pairwise association energy was \u22123.8 kcal/mol. Probably the simplest way to describe assembly of a capsid of N assembly units (AUs) is as a progressive series of intermediates 100 . To quantify this description, one can assume that all contacts between assembly units have the same energy, energies are additive, microscopic forward rates are identical (subject to statistical considerations), and that backward rates are the product of forward rates, dissociation constants and statistical terms. The result is a series of rate equation each with terms for assembly and disassembly of n-mer and (n+1)mer, respectively. Two equations in the series are unique: the monomer equation references all intermediates and the final equation is a dead-end with only one build-up and one build-down term.",

Nucleic acid-regulated allostery is observed with bacteriophage MS2 and retroviruses, e.g. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). Retroviral Gag, the 'capsid protein' of immature retroviruses, is a multidomain protein. The elements of Gag that are most important for this discussion are the two-domain capsid (CA) segment (the primary mediator of Gag-Gag interactions), a spacer peptide that follows CA, and the RNA-binding nucleocapsid (NC) segment. The earliest suggestion of allostery in retrovirus assembly came from in vitro assembly studies using DNA oligomers and Gag 22, 23 . Gag dimerization was critical for assembly --HIV Gag would not assemble with very short oligos nor if the oligo had high affinity sequences separated by a low affinity sequence, suggesting that protein-protein interaction was required to activate assembly 24 . Replacing NC with a leucine zipper promoted dimerization of Gag and was sufficient to drive assembly in cells 25 , though other factors were required in vitro 26 . What transitions are driven by protein oligomerization and DNA-binding? Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) indicated that HIV Gag had a propensity to fold on itself 17 , thus, straightening might be a critical assembly transition. NMR studies have indicated that the spacer sequence C-terminal to Gag (in HIV and RSV) can refold 27, 28 . This refolding transition, driven by binding nucleic acid, might expose surfaces on CA to allow interaction 28 and generate a new, potentially helix-rich interaction between the spacer peptides 29, 30 . Recent tomographic studies of immature HIV demonstrate CA-CA interactions and spacer peptidespacer peptide interactions 30, 31 . Thus, it appears that Gag undergoes one or more conformational transitions to assemble into an immature lattice. These conformational transitions are involved in Gag assembly and are consistent with a regulatory effect, i.e. they prevent assembly by obstructing interactions 28 and this obstruction can be removed by binding a co-factor 26 .",

            "text": "In the RNA bacteriophage MS2, the role of allostery mediated by nucleic acid is unambiguous ( Figure 2 ). These phages are organized with T=3 quasi-symmetry; their capsids are comprised of 90 chemically identical dimers that fit into AB and CC environments 32 . B half-dimers cluster around icosahedral fivefold vertices, A and C halfdimers alternate around icosahedral threefolds (quasi-sixfolds). The A and C half-dimers are very similar, while a loop on the B subunits has a different conformation, suggesting a structural switch. Uhlenbeck and co-workers showed that a specific RNA stem-loop from the genome, TR, was necessary and by itself sufficient to induce capsid assembly 33, 34 . By NMR, TR-free dimer was shown to be symmetrical in solution, suggestive of a CC dimer, but TR-bound dimer was asymmetric 35 . Pure RNA-free dimers or pure TR-saturated dimers do not assemble rapidly, i.e. they appeared kinetically trapped 35 . Addition of the other form of coat protein to trapped species resulted in rapid assembly 36 . These results showed that both forms of dimer, symmetric and RNA-bound asymmetric, are needed for efficient assembly and that RNA was an allosteric effector. Non-TR RNA stem-loops also trigger these effects, although they are much weaker binders, implying that multiple RNA-coat protein interactions within the capsids also contribute to conformer switching 36, 37 . Normal mode analysis has suggested that the RNA-induced conformational change might be one of dynamics, rather than static dimer conformations 38 , and is consistent with the lack of sequence-specificity. Analyzing mixed assembly reactions by mass spectrometry has provided a clear example of assembly by one dimer at a time rather than via coalescence of oligomers 35 . Examination of assembly reactions with TR incorporated into a longer RNA have lead to the surprising conclusion that assembly might be directed by an RNA scaffold 36 , funneling the system along only a few of the very many possible assembly paths 36 . Thus, initiation by an allosteric event and limitation by allosteric responses to protein-RNA and protein-protein interaction gives MS2 assembly the appearance of following a deterministic path. Interestingly, recent theoretical studies suggest that only a relatively small number of intermediates will ever be used during assembly as a consequence of kinetic availability and thermodynamic stability 39 .",

Conformational differences between free Cp dimer and the same protein in the context of capsid are evident in the crystal structure of an assembly defective mutant (Figure 3b) 40 . Dimers from capsid are symmetrical about the dimer interface 41 , while free dimer is asymmetric. Comparison of the structures suggests a mechanical linkage of sub-domains connected to a central chassis; these sub-domains displace one another like so many molecular dominos, leading to movements of up to 9 \u00c5 and a conformation that is geometrically incompatible with an icosahedral structure. In comparison to the crystal structure, an NMR study under nonassembly conditions showed a symmetric dimer that was readily asymmetrized by interaction with a Cp-binding peptide 42 . Thus, the dimer is able to adopt multiple conformations, or families of conformations, tentatively categorized as assembly-active and assembly-inactive.",

This hypothesis leads to predictions about the nature of assembly and its allosteric activation. First, as per assembly models, a kinetic effect will be most evident in the nucleation step. Starting capsid assembly at an inappropriate time (e.g. without the viral genetic material) is likely to be bad for the virus. Second, faster kinetics indicate that effectors decrease the energy barrier to assembly, which can be best explained by invoking an effector-induced conformational change. The graphic of the HAP site in the context of free and the capsid conformations (Figure 3c ) supports this hypothesis. The key point is that only the nucleation step of an assembly reaction needs be affected to gain an overall enhancement of assembly kinetics (Figure 3d) . Thus, the few effectors needed for nucleation can be leveraged to consume many copies of Cp for the production of failed virus.",

Retaining the E3 protein until the trans-Golgi might serve to prevent premature fusion of the assembled spikes with membranes in the host cell secretory pathway. Thus, E3 is an effector of spike activity. At the plasma membrane the spikes are arranged in large hexagonal arrays 64 , creating a platform for virus budding. Host proteins have not been identified within the alphavirus glycoprotein array, suggesting lateral interactions between the spikes are important, in contrast to vesicular stomatitis virus 65 , HIV 66 , and influenza virus 67 which also bud from the plasma membrane. Though not usually described as such, pE2 acts as an effector of E1 activation at two different times, as a chaperone and by releasing E3 for activation. Similar to pE2, the flavivirus prM protein chaperones folding of the flavivirus E protein, and cleavage of the pr peptide is required to transition from the immature to the mature flavivirus.

            "text": "While targeting specific conformations is an attractive antiviral strategy, we further propose that one should consider the dynamic nature of virus assembly and that interfering with the environmental sensors and their targets could be equally beneficial. Both capsid and glycoprotein assembly are carefully orchestrated events requiring activation, by known and unidentified effectors. For example, we have learned from the HAP molecules that interfering with assembly is not equivalent to inhibiting assembly. In addition, weak interactions between protein subunits or glycoprotein complexes minimize production of misassembled spikes. Thus, altering the kinetics, misdirecting the intermediates, stabilizing an interaction to prevent disassembly are all viable options that disrupt a highly evolved set of reactions to achieve the same end goal: reduced virus propagation.",

            "text": "Assembly of a dodecahedron from pentagonal assembly units (faded colors) is more robust if regulated by nucleation. In nucleated assembly (top path), the initial association reactions are relatively slow, resulting in rare nucleation centers (brightly colored oligomer) and plenty of assembly units to allow completion of capsids. If assembly is unregulated (lower path), many partial capsids will form and very few assembly units will remain, kinetically trapping these intermediates. Of course, this trap might resolve if stochastic dissociation of some intermediates allows others to go to completion; alternatively, partial capsids can associate incorrectly, resulting in aberrant structures. (a) The T=3 capsid of MS2 has 60 AB dimers (blue and green, respectively) and 30 CC dimers (red), so that A and C subunits alternate around the quasi-sixfold axes. Icosahedral fivefold and quasi-sixfold (icosahedral threefold) vertices are shown in this representation. (b) The CC dimers are necessarily symmetric with an extended loop (highlighted in the open triangles) connecting the F and G \u03b2 strands at either end. Bound RNA, the TR stem-loop (in yellow), induces asymmetry in the AB dimers so that the FG loop of the B subunit (in the pentagon) adopts a unique conformation that allows it to pack around the fivefold vertices. (c) Pure CC dimers (red) or pure AB dimers (green and blue), with bound RNA, assemble rapidly when mixed, leading to the hypothesis that assembly proceeds in a stepwise reaction. The hexameric threefold cluster is one of the major complexes identified by mass spectrometry, suggesting a highly deterministic assembly path. This hypothesis has been strongly supported by further examination of RNA-driven assembly 98 . This figure was adapted from Ref. 35 . The HBV capsid is constructed from 120 dimers arrayed with T=4 icosahedral symmetry. One of the 60 icosahedral asymmetric units, an AB and CD dimer, are highlighted against on the 20 triangular facets that surface an icosahedron. Shown are two overlaid crystal structures of HBV (blue, PDB 2G33) and HBV with bound HAP1 assembly effector (red, PDB 2G34). More red is visible as HAPs cause the capsid to expand. Sixty HAPs are bound with high occupancy to a pocket in the C subunits (two are shown as white squares) 41 . (b) Dimers from the capsid (yellow) are symmetrical and identical. Asymmetric free dimers (blue, PDB 3KXS) are presumably in an assembly-inactive conformation. (c) A free dimer is color coded to show the chassis (blue) that is identical to the dimer from capsid and the three mobile subdomains (red, green, and orange). The subdomains are connected to the chassis by flexible joints, either Gly or Pro. Movement of one subdomain will force the others to shift their positions. A HAP molecule (magenta), modeled into its binding site, coordinates mobile subdomains with the chassis, facilitating the transition to an assemblyactive state 40 . (d) HAPs accelerate assembly, even without misdirecting the reaction. Assembly of 10 \u03bcM Cp initiated by ionic strength in the presence of 0 to 15 \u03bcM HAP1 9 . The inset micrographs show that 2 \u03bcM HAP1 yields spherical virus-like particles very fast, whereas higher HAP concentrations yield aberrant structures that scatter much more light. proteins. Four monomers of E1 have been fit into the cryo-electron microscopy density of the 9 \u00c5 resolution Sindbis map and are shown in yellow, blue, red, and green. The yellow monomers surround the icosahedral three-fold axis while the blue, red, and green monomers surround the quasi-three-fold axis. The density corresponding to the E1 proteins has been subtracted from the density of the entire spike. The remaining density, which corresponds to the E2 protein, is shown in gray. The E2 protein covers the E1 protein and makes up the top portion of the spike. Interactions between E2-E1 heterodimers, along with those within the heterodimer, are thought to stabilize the spike complex. (d) A model of the allosteric changes that occur during assembly of the viral glycoproteins. The polyprotein is cleaved by cellular proteases to the individual proteins (green, E3; blue, E2; red, E1; 6K is not shown for clarity). Dimerization of pE2 and E1 to (pE2-E1) is followed by trimerization of the heterodimer, (pE2-E1) 3 . Last, cleavage of E3 from pE2 leaves a fusion competent trimer, (E2-E1) 3 . Changes in color indicate conformational changes in addition to changes in aggregation state. Panels (a), (b), and (c) were adapted from Ref. 51 Tomography a The structures of most enveloped viruses, either entire particles or portions of the particle, have been determined using cryo-electron microscopy either by single particle averaging or tomography.",
