Information on potential exposures was typically collected for each of the preceding 14 days, but some cases had repeated exposures and our analysis explicitly allowed for the interval censoring in the exposure data. 14 In this analysis we could not include cases that reported recent live poultry exposure but could not recall the exact dates of exposures.",

Instead, here we chose to investigate the hospitalization fatality risk, i.e. the risk of death among hospitalized cases, for two reasons. First, mild infections are less likely to have been detected, both for A(H7N9) and A(H5N1), and therefore the risk of death among medicallyattended and laboratory-confirmed cases would be quite different, potentially by orders of magnitude, to the symptomatic case fatality risk (i.e. the risk of death among symptomatic cases of A(H7N9) virus infection). Second, mild cases identified through sentinel influenzalike illness surveillance or contact tracing should have a substantially lower risk of mortality than serious cases admitted with pneumonia, and a single estimated case fatality risk would misrepresent this heterogeneity. We therefore estimated the hospitalization fatality risk using a non-parametric approach that accounted for the competing risks of death or discharge, as well as right-censoring of the outcomes of patients still hospitalized. 18 We estimated 95% confidence intervals for the hospitalization fatality risk by using bootstrap estimates of the asymptotic variance with 1000 replications. 18 All statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.0.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).",

While both viruses are of avian origin, and neither has yet acquired the ability for sustained human-to-human transmission, there are stark differences in the epidemiology to date. 20 Whereas most confirmed A(H7N9) and A(H5N1) cases reported exposure to live poultry (Table 1) , the type of exposure was very different in urban and rural locations. This is clearly illustrated in Figure 3 , where the male:female ratio is much higher in urban than rural areas for both viruses. This observation is most consistent with sex-based differences in exposure rather than differences in immunity. In particular, the male:female ratio is highest for cases in Shanghai compared to other urban areas (data not shown), anecdotally this is the Chinese city where men may have the greatest frequent retail exposures to live poultry than women. 21 Our deduction has at least prima facie validity in that the age distribution of urban A(H7N9) cases is consistent with increasing exposure to retail poultry with age. 22, 23 Whereas some of the rural A(H5N1) cases have occurred in areas with low population density and were associated with exposure to backyard live poultry or handling of slaughtered poultry, 24 most of the rural cases of A(H7N9) occurred in people who live on the outskirts of urban areas and were exposed to retail poultry in live poultry markets; few A(H7N9) cases were exposed to backyard poultry ( Table 1 ). The preponderance of females among the rural A(H5N1) cases may be due to greater exposures to rearing, slaughtering and cooking backyard poultry. 7 The characteristics of A(H5N1) cases in China were similar to A(H5N1) cases in other countries in the region ( Table 4 ).",

[25] [26] [27] Of note, the present findings concur with those estimated by an entirely different method based on inference from the time series of cases. 28 The clarification of the incubation period distribution has important implications. Current case definitions should be updated since incubation periods as long as 8 to 10 days are very unlikely. Quarantine or medical surveillance for close contacts need not last longer than one week since more than 95% of cases would present within seven days of infection. Accurate estimates of the incubation period distribution can help estimate epidemic potential in the event an avian influenza virus emerges that is efficiently transmissible in humans.",

Because estimates of the laboratory-confirmed case fatality risk may misinterpreted as estimates of the symptomatic case fatality risk, although they differ substantially, we focused on the hospitalization fatality risk i.e. the risk of death among hospitalized cases. 19 We found the hospitalization fatality risk of A(H7N9) to be around 35%, much lower than for A(H5N1). The hospitalization fatality risk of 70% for A(H5N1) was similar to other reports from the region except for Vietnam (Table 4) , [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] and higher than estimates from Egypt perhaps because of differences in the viral clade or differences in speed of hospital admissions and levels of care. 35, 36 The longer average duration of hospitalization for A(H7N9) before death (Figure 4 ) may be a reflection of advances in medical care which can sustain life for longer, but could also indicate slower disease progression. However, we did not examine detailed clinical information in this report given a separate nationally-based effort already under way. The relatively long onset to admission intervals and onset to laboratory-confirmation intervals for A(H7N9) with respective medians of 4.2 days and 8.3 days currently (Figures 4B and  4C ) could be reduced in order to permit more timely thus more effective treatment with antivirals. 29, 31 If preliminary testing can indicate influenza A virus infection either by rapid point-of-care tests or by RT-PCR, this could permit early antiviral treatment before the subtype is known.",

Almost all laboratory-confirmed A(H7N9) cases had serious illness including pneumonia, and all A(H5N1) cases had pneumonia. Laboratory confirmation of a small number of A(H7N9) virus infections with mild to moderate disease is suggestive of a larger number of mild to moderate cases. 8 In addition, as of May 24, 17 A(H7N9) cases are still in hospital, and the current A(H7N9) outbreak may yet not have ended which could lead to some bias in the follow-up data. Second, our estimates of the incubation period are based on a subset of 32 cases with information on single or repeated exposures, while accurate and complete information on exposures can be difficult to ascertain. The lack of exposure data for some cases could have biased the estimates of the incubation period distribution.",

The differences in age distribution of laboratory-confirmed A(H7N9) and A(H5N1) cases are intriguing; presumably immunity associated with different histories of influenza virus exposures plays an important role in addition to differences in exposure patterns. While we have reported the hospitalization fatality risk, the symptomatic case fatality risk remains to be determined and it is possible that a large portion of the 'clinical iceberg' of infection has remained undetected to date. The warm season has now begun in China, and no new laboratoryconfirmed human A(H7N9) cases have been identified since May 8. If A(H7N9) follows a similar pattern to A(H5N1) ( Figure 2B) , it is possible that the A(H7N9) epidemic may reappear in the fall. This potential lull should be an opportunity for discussion of definitive preventive public health measures, and optimization of clinical management, as well as capacity building in the region given the possibility that A(H7N9) may spread outside China's borders.",

This is more consistent with exposure playing a major role in risk of infection, although we cannot rule out the possibility of differences in immunity or health care seeking behaviors. The majority of cases of both viruses reported recent exposure to poultry (Table 1) and there is good evidence of the low human-to-human transmissibility given extensive contact tracing efforts and very low numbers of potential secondary cases identified. Some of the epidemiologic parameters were similar for both viruses (Figure 4 panels A-C), while hospitalized cases of A(H5N1) had a higher risk of fatality (70% vs 35%) and more rapid disease progression ( Figure 4D ). Given the seasonal pattern in human infections with influenza A(H5N1) virus in China ( Figure  2B ), we must be prepared for A(H7N9) to reappear later this year. Average numbers of close contacts traced for laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) and A(H5N1) in mainland China with available data. Types of exposure were ordered by risk level and categorized to be mutually exclusive by excluding overlapping cases with higher risk of exposure. \"Exposure to poultry elsewhere\" includes exposure to backyard poultry. \u2020 Other contacts includes family and community contacts. Missing data were imputed by assumin the same ratio between healthcare and other contacts in the same category.",

Whereas A(H5N1) cases have been distributed across most parts of China, A(H7N9) cases in mainland China were initially concentrated in the Yangtze river delta in eastern China, with the most recent cases being detected radially away from the initial epicenter to the south and north (Figure 1).Ninety-three (72%) of the A(H7N9) cases occurred in residents of urban areas. In contrast, the incidence rate of the A(H5N1) cases peaked in 2006, and 24 (56%) of the cases occurred in rural residents(Figure 1, Figures 2A and 2C).
