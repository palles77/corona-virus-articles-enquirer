            "text": "Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) can cause neurological disease when inoculated intracerebrally (ic) into mice and rats. Specifically the JHM strain of MHV (MHV-JHM) generally causes an acute encephalitis when inoculated ic into 2-dayold Wistar Furth rats. In contrast, JHM generally produces a chronic demyelinating disease with resulting posterior paralysis when inoculated ic into lo-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, while JHM readily produces a productive infection in a mouse fibroblast cell line (L-2), it does not form syncytia or replicate well in a tissue cell line of glial origin (G26-24). We have isolated and characterized three MHV-JHM viral variants from the central nervous system of two Wistar Furth rats with a MHVJHM-induced demyelinating disease. The pattern of viral-specific mRNA for all three of these variants differed from what was observed for the wild-type parental MHV-JHM that had been passaged only in tissue culture. One of these variants, ATllf cord virus, which induced a chronic demyelinating disease in 2-or lo-dayold intracerebrally inoculated Wistar Furth rats, had a deletion in the coding region of the peplomer glycoprotein mRNA. In addition, this variant formed massive syncytia and replicated well in G26-24 cells. We have not detected this deletion in the other two JHM variants, ATllf brain virus and ATlIe brain virus. ATllf brain virus and ATlIe brain virus primarily produced an acute encephalitiswhen reinoculated into 2-or 1 O-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, these two variants did not form syncytia and had a reduced ability to replicate in G26-24 cells. o 1999Academic press, I~C.",

When 2-day-old Wistar Furth rats are inoculated intracerebrally (ic) with the JHM strain of MHV, most of the rats die within one week of inoculation with an acute encephalitis (Sorensen et al., 1980; Parham et a/., 1986) . In these rats, grey matter lesions generally predominate in the central nervous system (CNS). When Wistar Furth rats are inoculated ic at 10 days of age with JHM, they generally do not develop symptoms until 2-4 weeks postinoculation (Jackson et al., 1984; Parham et a/., 1986) . These rats develop a chronic demyelinating disease characterized by hind leg paralysis or paresis (Sorensen et al., 1980; Jackson et al., 1984; Parham et a/., 1986) . Those rats that survive for longer than 3 weeks postinoculation generally have predominately white matter lesions.",

This leader is encoded only at the 5' end of the genomic RNA (Lai et al., , 1984 Spaan et al., 1983) .

Recombinant virus also arises at a high frequency in mouse CNS tissue that is infected with a mixture of ts mutants of A59 and JHM (Keck eta/., 1988a) . We have previously reported a truncated version of the E2 glycoprotein mRNA is present in the CNS of Wistar Furth rats with a JHM-induced demyelinating disease (Jackson et al., 1984) . Further work demonstrated that JHM E2 glycoprotein can be detected in individual cells of JHM-infected CNS tissue; however, the ratio of detectable E2 antigen to nucleocapsid antigen in the total CNS tissue of infected rats is reduced by more than 13fold compared with JHM-infected tissue culture cells (Parham et al., 1986) . In these studies, virus was not isolated from these rats and characterized, and we did not explore the possibility that changes in the isolated virus could be correlated with the biological properties of this virus.",

At 14 days postinoculation, the rat was severely runted and developed hind leg paresis. Virus was recovered independently from the brain and spinal cord and designated ATllf brain virus and ATIIf cord virus, respectively. We thus could directly compare two virus isolates recovered from a single inoculated rat pup. A littermate of ATllf (designated ATlle) was also inoculated ic at 10 days of age with the same cloned stock of JHM virus. At 13 days postinoculation, rat ATlIe showed symptoms similar to those observed in ATllf and was killed. Virus was isolated from the brain of rat ATlle and was designated ATlIe brain virus. Results obtained with ATlle brain virus were generally similar to those obtained with ATIIf brain virus. MHV-JHM viral variants were isolated from the brain or spinal cord of the inoculated Wistar Furth rats using a modified procedure of Sorensen et al. (1980) . Specifically the tissue was minced into 1 X EMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum to form a 20% (w/ v) suspension. This suspension was homogenized with a motorized Dounce (G. K. Heller Corp., Floral Park, NY), and passed first through an 18-gauge needle, and then through a 28-gauge needle. The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 915 g for 10 min. The virus was then pelleted from the supernatant at 64,800 g for 1 hr. The pellet was resuspended in 1X EMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. ATllf cord virus was three times plaque purified.

However, ATllf brain virus, ATlIe brain virus, and wild-type JHM virus-infected oligodendroglioma cells (G26-24) resembled uninfected G26-24 cultures except individual cells \"rounded up\" and lifted off from the monolayer ( Fig. 1 ; data not shown for JHM virus). These infected cultures only rarely contained viral-induced syncytia. In contrast, ATIIf cord virus formed massive syncytia equally well in mouse L-2 and G26-24 cells (Fig. 1 ). Starting with a single stock of ATllf cord virus, the ratio of the titer in G26-24 cells to the titer in L-2 cells was 0.472 (Table 1) . However, the same ratio for ATllf brain virus was 0.008, for ATlIe brain virus was 0.011, and for wild-type JHM was 0.010 (Table 1) . Therefore, the ratio of the viral titer in G26-24 cells compared with L-2 cells was approximately 50fold higher for ATllf cord virus than for the brain virus variants and wild-type JHM (Table 1) .

Northern transfer analysis indicated that viral mRNAs 4, 5, 6 (El envelope glycoprotein), and 7 (nucleocapsid) comigrated for all the viral variants and JHM wild-type viruses ( Fig. 3 ; data not shown for ATlIe virus). However, the ATllf cord virus produced a truncated mRNA 3 (E2 envelope glycoprotein) with a molecular weight of 2.85 X 1 O6 Da; the ATIIf brain, ATlIe brain, and wild-type JHM viruses all produced E2 glycoprotein mRNA of 3.0 X 1 O6 Da which comigrate. In addition, ATllf brain and ATlIe brain viruses each produced two novel mRNA species (3.3 and 3.6 X 10\" Da). These mRNA species were distinct from the 4.0 X 10\" Da mRNA species seen with the wild-type JHM virus. We observed a uni- form deletion of approximately 1.5 X 1 O5 Da from the E2 glycoprotein and higher molecularweight subgenomic mRNAs of ATllf cord virus when compared with ATllf and ATlIe brain viruses. Because the E2 mRNA was the lowest molecular weight mRNA with a deletion and because of the nested set arrangement of the coronavirus mRNAs (Stern and Kennedy, 1980a,b; Cheley et al., 1981 a; Weiss and Leibowitz, 1983) one can conclude that the deletion occurred in the coding region of the E2 glycoprotein mRNA of the ATIIf cord virus. The genomic size RNA from wild-type JHM and JHM variants appeared to comigrate (Fig. 3) . Therefore no size change was detected in this RNA species. This result is in agreement with the JHM variants isolated from Lewis rats (Taguchi et a/., 1985) .",

Again the differences were confirmed by mixing experiments, this time between protein extracted from ATllf brain virus and ATIIf cord virus-infected cells (Fig. 4C) . The ATIIf cord virus thus had a deletion in its E2 mRNA of approximately 150,000 Da (Fig. 3) and a deletion of approximately 15,000 Da from the E2 protein (Figs. 3 and 4). These deletions corresponded to a loss of approximately 130 amino acids from the E2 glycoprotein and approximately 390 nucleotides from the E2 mRNA.

Furthermore, Keck and co-workers (198813) have shown that the replacement of A59 genetic sequences at the 5'end of the E2 glycoprotein gene with the fusion-negative MHV-2 sequences do not affect the fusion ability of the recombinant viruses. They thus suggest that the 3' end of the E2 glycoprotein may be crucial for the fusion-inducibility of the virus.

The virus isolated from the brain (ATllf brain virus) produced acute encephalitis when reinoculated ic into Wistar Furth rats, and the virus isolated from the spinal cord (ATllf cord virus) produced a chronic demyelinating disease with predominantly white matter lesions.

            "text": "In our experiments, the alterations in the mRNA of the variants occurred during the infection of the CNS by the virus and did not involve any in vitro selection by antibodies or other means. The major difference that was apparent between these variants was the deletion in the E2 glycoprotein mRNA that was present in the ATIIf cord virus. The ATIIf cord viral variant induced a chronic demyelinating disease in 2-or lo-day-old intracerebrally inoculated Wistar Furth rats. The other variants (ATllf brain virus and ATlIe brain virus) produced an acute encephalitis in either 2-or 1 O-day-old intracerebrally inoculated Wistar Furth rats. These results confirmed and expanded our previous results that the JHM RNA species present in the CNS of Wistar Furth rats with a JHM-induced demyelinating disease differ from what is seen in tissue culture cells infected with wild-type JHM virus (Jackson eta/., 1984) . Our earlier work also suggests that a truncated version of the JHM E2 glycoprotein mRNA is present in rats with a JHM-induced demyelinating disease (Jackson et al., 1984) . Work by Fleming uses monoclonal antibodies to the E2 viral glycoprotein to select antigenic variant viruses that escape neutralization in vitro (Fleming et a/., 1986) . Variants selected with one of the E2 monoclonal antibodies are highly virulent and causes an encephalitis in inoculated mice. A second selected variant predominantly causes a subacute paralytic disease clinically and extensive demyelinating histology. Thus the E2 glycoprotein appears to be important in determining JHM pathogenesis in different systems. However, one cannot rule out that other factors or undetected genomic changes could also be involved. Future work will investigate this question. ATllf brain virus and ATlIe brain virus produced two novel high-molecular-weight RNAs (3.3 X 1 O6 and 3.6 x 1 O6 Da) which were not present in the wild-type JHM. These RNA species might represent deletions in mRNA 2. However, since this mRNA codes for a nonstructural protein whose antiserum is not available, we have not been able to determine if the protein coded by mRNA 2 is altered. In addition, the nucieotide sequence of the coding region for mRNA 2 has not been published; when this information is available it will assist in determining the nature of the novel RNAs produced by the brain virus variants.",

            "text": "Polymorphism has been observed in the E2 glycoprotein of coronaviruses (Talbot and Buchmeier, 1985) . Sequencing analysis has revealed that 89 amino acids are present in MHV strain A59 but are absent in JHM (Schmidt et a/., 1987; Luytjes et al., 1987) . This difference is similar to the number of amino acids that are deleted from the E2 glycoprotein of the variant ATIIf cord virus when compared with either wild-type JHM or ATIIf brain or ATlIe brain virus. Since the E2 protein is involved in the adsorption of the virus to cells and the induction of cell to cell fusion (Collins et al., 1982; Siddell et a/., 1982; Fleming et al., 1983; Sturman and Holmes, 1984) it seems logical that changes in this protein could alter the ability of the virus to infect certain cell types. Since ATllf cord virus infection was associated with greater white matter involvement and chronic demyelinating disease, one would predict that the variant ATIIf cord virus would have an increased ability to infect glial cells when compared with ATllf brain and ATlIe brain viral variants. In fact, we observed that ATIIf cord virus showed a marked increase in syncytiogenesis in an oligodendroglioma cell line (G26-24). Furthermore, the ratio of the titer in G26-24 cells over the titers in L-2 cells was approximately 50-fold higher for ATllf cord virus than it was for ATIIf brain or ATlIe brain virus. Viral variants have also been recovered from Lewis rats with a JHM-induced acute encephalitis (Taguchi et al., 1985) . Taguchi and co-workers have reported that these variants produce mRNAs 2 and 3 which are approximately 500 bases larger than is reported for wildtype JHM. These variants also produce an envelope glycoprotein that is 15,000 Da larger than is seen with wild-type JHM. However, no alterations are detected in the genomic size RNA. The wild-type JHM and one of the variant viruses (~1-2) produce cell fusion in a continuous cell line of mouse origin (DBT). The titer for the wild-type virus was approximately 1 O-fold higher than for ~1-2. Both JHM and cl-2 produce acute encephalitis in intracerebrally inoculated rats; however, less infectious cl-2 virus is required to produce an acute encephalitis. Some similarities and differences can be seen between these experiments and those reported in this paper. OurJHM variants were isolated from a Wistar Furth rat with a viral-induced demyelinating disease instead of an encephalitis. Variant ATllf cord virus contains an apparent deletion in the coding region of mRNA 3 instead of an insertion of extra nucleotides. Curiously, the size of the insertion in mRNA 3 for the variant cl-2 is very similar to the size of the deletion in mRNA 3 for ATllf cord virus. The relative location of these alter-ations in mRNA 3 may help determine the significance of this observation. In addition, cl-2 and the variant viruses we have isolated all induce cell fusion and replicate well in continuous cell lines in which JHM also induces syncytia and produces a high titer of virus. However, we have extended these observations to show that ATllf cord virus can replicate much better in a cell line of glial origin (G26-24) than does wild-type JHM. CI-2 and ATllf brain virus and ATlIe brain virus do not contain deletions in their E2 envelope glycoprotein and produce encephalitis when injected into rats. In contrast, ATllf cord virus does have a deletion in the E2 glycoprotein and produces a demyelinating disease in rats. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a deletion in the viral E2 glycoprotein is associated with the ability of the virus to produce a demyelinating disease in rats. Further work with additional variants will be necessary to test this hypothesis. Finally, no alterations are detectable in the genomic size RNA produced by the variants isolated by both Taguchi and coworkers (Taguchi eta/., 1985) and ourselves; however, all of the variants produce alterations which are readily detectable in mRNA 3 and/or mRNA 2. The lack of detectable alterations in the genomic size RNA raises the possibility that the variants may not arise via a simple deletion or insertion of bases in the viral genome. The viral mRNAs are generated by a leader-primed transcription which involves the fusion of noncontiguous transcripts (Baric et a/., 1983; Makino et al., 1986) . Therefore, a possible mechanism for the generation of the variants involves an alteration in either the leader coding sequences or in one or more of the primer binding sites. Recent studies suggest that the binding of leader RNA to template RNA during the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA may not be precise even for wildtype JHM (Makino et a/., 1988) . Therefore, small alterations in either the primer or primer binding sites could result in changes in the size of subgenomic mRNAs. Nucleotide sequencing studies should help determine how these variants arise.",
