            "text": "Objectives: This study aims to describe the clinical and molecular epidemiology of HRV infections among HM patients. Study design: From April 2012-March 2013, HRV-positive respiratory specimens from symptomatic HM patients were molecularly characterized by analysis of partial viral protein 1 (VP1) or VP4 gene sequence. HRV LRTI risk-factors and outcomes were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: One hundred and ten HM patients presented with HRV URTI (n = 78) and HRV LRTI (n = 32). Hypoalbuminemia (OR 3.0; 95% CI, 1.0-9.2; p = 0.05) was independently associated with LRTI, but other clinical and laboratory markers of host immunity did not differ between patients with URTI versus LRTI. Detection of bacterial co-pathogens was common in LRTI cases (25%). Among 92 typeable respiratory specimens, there were 58 (64%) HRV-As, 12 (13%) HRV-Bs, and 21 (23%) HRV-Cs, and one Enterovirus 68. LRTI rates among HRV-A (29%), HRV-B (17%), and HRV-C (29%) were similar. HRV-A infections occurred year-round while HRV-B and HRV-C infections clustered in the late fall and winter. Conclusions: HRVs are associated with LRTI in HM patients. Illness severity is not attributable to specific HRV species or types. The frequent detection of bacterial co-pathogens in HRV LRTIs further substantiates the hypothesis that HRVs predispose to bacterial superinfection of the lower airways, similar to that of other community-acquired respiratory viruses.",

HRVs are classified taxonomically within the enterovirus (EV) group and subdivided into three species: A, B and C. Across the three species are more than 100 different serotypes. Since identification and designation of HRV-C species in 2006 [1] , several studies have demonstrated increased rates of asthma exacerbations and LRTIs among children with HRV-C versus HRV-A or HRV-B infections [2] [3] [4] . However, more recent data have failed to observe an association between HRV species and illness severity [5, 6] .",

We excluded patients with HM that was in remission and who had not received chemotherapy in the previous year. All hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients were included if transplant occurred within the previous 12 months and/or chronic graft-versus-host disease was present.

For the purposes of this study, patients testing positive for the HRV/EV target on the RP assay were assumed to have HRV infection, which was confirmed by molecular testing at Wadsworth. In addition to the RP, the following diagnostic microbiology studies were performed on BAL fluid from immunocompromised patients at NYP/WCMC using standard procedures: Gram stain and bacterial culture, calcofluor white potassium hydroxide stain and fungal culture, acid-fast bacillus stain and mycobacterial culture, PCRs for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis, Legionella direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) and culture, Pneumocystis jirovecii DFA, and Aspergillus galactomannan.",

Reverse transcription was performed on 10 l of RNA using the Quanta cDNA kit with random primers (Quanta, Gaithersburg, MD). The viral protein 1 (VP1) gene sequence of HRV was initially targeted using PCR primers designed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Unpublished, kindly provided by Dr. Dean Erdman). If this assay failed to produce a band for sequencing, a further assay with primers targeting a different region of the VP1 gene was used [7] . If the VP1 gene assays failed, the VP4 gene sequence was amplified with primers described in Coiras et al. [8] . PCR products were visualized on a 1.5% TAE gel, and purified using Affimetrix ExoZapIt on samples displaying the appropriate size products (Affimetrix Santa Clara, CA). Sequencing was performed using the PCR primers from each of the assays.",

Univariable analysis was conducted using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, as appropriate, for categorical variables; a P-value \u2264 0.05 was considered significant. Variables with a P-value \u2264 0.1 on univariable analysis were subsequently analyzed by multivariable logistic regression. Patients were followed for six months after the first HRV infection. Data were analyzed using STATA 12.1 (College Station, TX).

Table 3 illustrates the clinical and laboratory variables that were associated with HRV LRTI in patients without respiratory copathogens. As there were no significant differences in putative risk factors between proven and possible HRV LRTI, these cases were combined for analysis.

Consistent with our observed trend that HRV-B is less frequently associated with LRTI, Nakagome et al. demonstrated that HRV-B has lower and slower replication in cultured sinus epithelial cells, as well as lower cytokine and chemokine production as compared to HRV-A and HRV-C [27] .",

First, microbiologic data were captured at a single time point so we could not confirm that HRV infection preceded, and therefore, predisposed to cases of bacterial co-infection. Second, among patients with different HMs, there is considerable heterogeneity in host immunity due to underlying disease and chemotherapy that may have confounded our ability to isolate host factors associated with HRV LRTI. It is possible that the frequency of HRV was underestimated in our cohort given that most PCR assays are not able to detect all known HRVs [29] . Twenty (16%) respiratory specimens were not molecularly typed, usually due to low viral load. Additionally, despite the use of highly degenerate primers, extensive sequence variability in the regions targeted make universal typing of HRV challenging [30, 31] .",
