Here we report the presence of a class of discrete small SL RNA molecules that are derived from the genomic SL reiteration units of Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leptomonas collosoma. These small SL RNAs are 135, 105, and 95 nucleotides, respectively, and contain a 5'4erminal SL or SL-like sequence. Sl nuclease analyses demonstrate that these small SL RNAs are transcribed from continuous sequence within the respective SL reiteration units. With the exception of the SL sequence and a concensus donor splice site immediately following it, these small RNAs are not well conserved. We suggest that the small SL RNAs may function as a donor of the SL sequence in an intermolecular process that places the SL at the 5' terminus of many trypanosomatid mRNAs.",

            "text": "In the genome of Trypanosoma brucei, sequences encoding the SL are reiterated approximately 200 times and, for the most part, are organized in a large tandem array(s) of directly repeated 1.4 kb units, which each containing a single SL exon DeLange et al., 1983) . A few of these units, however, are orphons (Childs et al., 1981) -that is, they are dispersed from the tandem array Parsons et al., 1984c) . Given the occurrence of the SL on all VSG transcripts and the observation that sequences flanking the 5' side of the SL exon in the 1.4 kb repeat unit resemble eucaryotic polymerase II promoters, it has been proposed that the tandem array defines the 5' boundary of a unique VSG gene expression locus and serves as a multiple promoter, allowing high levels of VSG gene transcription (DeLange et al., 1983) . The presence of the SL on VSG transcripts, however, is but one example of its larger and more fundamental role in trypanosomatid gene expression. First, sequences homologous to the T. brucei SL are highly reiterated not only in the genomes of other species of Trypanosoma, for example the intracellular New World parasite T. cruzi, but also in other genera of the family Trypanosomatidae, notably the evolutionarily primitive insect parasite, Leptomonas collosoma DeLange et al., 198413) . Neither T. cruzi nor L. collosoma undergo antigenic variation, yet Northern analysis of RNA from these organisms reveals that their SL-like sequences are transcribed and are present on RNAs of diverse size (R. G. N. and M. S., unpublished data). In addition, the SL is heavily transcribed in T. brucei procyclic culture form cells (analogous to the insect midgut stage of the trypanosome life cycle) where VSG transcripts and VSGs are undetectable (De-Lange et al., 1983; Parsons et al., 1984c) . Second, we have isolated and characterized many different T. brucei non-VSG cDNA clones that contain the SL (Parsons et al., 1984a) . Individual clones identify discrete SL-containing transcripts; some of these are abundant or rare, constitutive or regulated, and are transcribed from single or multicopy genes. As is the case with VSG genes, the SL sequence is not encoded contiguously with, or detectably linked to, these structural genes. Based on the frequency of SL cDNA clones in bloodstream and procyclic culture form libraries, it seems likely that many, if not all, trypanosome mRNAs share this 35 nucleotide leader sequence. Thus the SL sequence is unique neither to African trypanosomes nor to VSG gene expression.",

We favor the hypothesis that the SL is added to these numerous transcripts by an intermolecular process, i.e., in trans. The two simplest mechanisms for such a process are primed transcription and post-transcriptional splicing/ligation In the first case, an SL transcript initiated in the SL reiteration unit would serve as a primer for the initiation of transcription from SL-utilizing genes. The second mechanism suggests that a similar SL transcript might serve as a substrate for intermolecular ligation to appropriate structural gene transcripts. Both models predict that a discrete SL-containing RNA is transcribed not only from the SL reiteration units of T. brucei, but from those of other trypanosomatid species as well.",

If the SL is located at the 5' end of the small SL RNAs of these organisms, one would expect the primer to be extended by 9 nucleotides in both cases. Small SL RNA-containing fractions were prepared by elution from polyacrylamide-urea gels and annealed with unlabeled 22-mer. The primer was extended with reverse transcriptase in the presence of all four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, one of which was 32P-labeled deoxycytidine triphosphate. Analysis of the reaction products is shown in Figure 2 . The major extension product obtained from the enriched small SL RNA fractions of T. brucei and T. cruzi indicated that the SL is located at the 5' end of the small SL RNAs of these organisms. The T. brucei small SL RNA extension reveals one major product of 31 nucleotides, the size expected for a 5'terminal location of the SL. Other less abundant extension products were also detected; these either represent size heterogeneity within the small SL RNA fraction or artifacts produced in vitro. Primer extension of the T. cruzi small SL RNA fraction also revealed one major extension product, indicating that the SL is located precisely at the 5' terminus of the small SL RNA (see Figure 26 ). Minor extension products were again detected, suggesting the existence of small SL RNA species that start either 5 nucleotides within the SL sequence or contain additional nucleotides 5' to the SL.",

The nine nucleotides 5' to the SL are identical in T. brucei and T. cruzi while L. collosoma shares seven of these nucelotides. On its 3' side, the SL sequence is immediately followed by a GT nucleotide pair in each of these organisms. This dinucleotide is identical with the invariant dinucleotide present in the concensus sequence of intron 5' splice sites (Lerner et al., 1980; Rogers and Wall, 1980) and, as discussed below, appears to be a functional donor splice junction. Putative transcription initiation and termination regions for each small SL RNA are also shown in Figure  5 . Approximately 30 bp 5' to the SL in T. brucei, an ATrich region has been noted as a possible RNA polymerase II concensus promoter (DeLange et al., 1983; Campbell et al., 1984a Campbell et al., , 1984b Dorfman and Donelson, 1984) . This concensus is not maintained in either of the other reiteration units, although an AT-rich region at -30 to -40 bp is found in each sequence. Immediately following the 3' end of the small SL RNAs in all three cases is a sequence very rich in thymidine residues. The role of this punctuated poly(T) tract is unknown but its conserved features and location suggest that it is a functional sequence element.",

A small region of homology to the SL is shared among the 5'-flanking regions of the three (non-VSG) target genes recently sequenced in our laboratory (S. Sather and K. Watkins, unpublished data). Blocks of 5, 6, and 10 contiguous nucleotides, complementary to all or part of the SL sequence pACAGTTTCTG, occur on the template strands just 5' to the acceptor splice sites of these three genes. It is not clear if this observation is pertinent to priming since the sites of transcription initiation have not been determined. Clearly if these or other SL target genes are initially transcribed as precursors containing excess 5' sequence, and preliminary evidence suggests this may be the case for one of the above mentioned genes (Parsons et al., 1984a) as well as for one VSG gene (Van der Ploeg et al., 1982) the putative primer recognition sequence should be located upstream from the 5' end of the primary transcript, not adjacent to the structural gene as in the above cases.",

However, unlike U RNAs the small SL RNA would function as a substrate consumed during the course of the reaction. The small SL RNA and precursor mRNA could be ligated end-to-end to produce a precursor containing a hybrid intron. This precursor could then be processed normally by splicing at the SL donor and target mRNA acceptor splice sites. On the other hand, the 3' end of the small SL RNA and the 5' end of the precursor mRNA may be thought of as parts of a discontinuous intron, which, if aligned properly, could undergo intermolecular splicing by conventional intramolecular mechanisms. Both variations of the splicing model require that the target mRNA is transcribed as a precursor containing at the least two additional 5' nucleotides (AG/) that comprise the acceptor splice site ( Figure 6B ).

In the case of influenza virus, small 5' capped oligonucleotides derived from hostcell mRNAs are used by a viral polymerase complex to prime viral transcription; no sequence homology between primer and template is involved in this process (Plotch et al., 1981) . Intermolecular RNA recombination (i.e., splicing/ ligation) occurring post-transcriptionally has been hypothesized in the putative origin and evolution of viroid RNAs from plant cell introns (Zimmern, 1982) .",
