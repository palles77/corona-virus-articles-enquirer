The gene encoding the IBV nsp2 N-terminal domain (residues 9-393 of the polyprotein) was cloned by PCR and inserted between the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-6p-1 plasmid (GE Healthcare). The forward and reverse PCR primers used for amplification were IBV-nsp2N-F (5 0 -CGGGATCCATGG-TATCTCCCAAACTAAGGG-3 0 ) and IBV-nsp2N-R (5 0 -CCGCTC-GAGTTAACTAAAAGAAGAGTAGATTG-3 0 ). The resulting construct was sequenced to ensure that no mutations had occurred during amplification. The double mutant was generated by using the PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method twice. The primers used to generate the nucleic acid mutant were IBV-nsp2N-Q132L-F (5 0 -CTGGATGCTCGTGCACTAACTCTTGATG-3 0 ), IBV-nsp2N-Q132L-R (5 0 -TGCACGAGCATCCAGTGTTTCTACA-3 0 ), IBV-nsp2N-L270F-F (5 0 -AAAATTTTCACTACATTTGCCTTCTTTA-3 0 ) and IBV-nsp2N-L270F-R (5 0 -TGTAGTGAAAATTTTAGCACCC-ATG-3 0 ). DNA sequencing confirmed that only the appropriate mutation was incorporated into the construct. The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and the cells were cultured in LB medium containing 0.1 mg ml \u00c01 ampicillin at 310 K until the optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) reached 0.6. 0.2 mM isopropyl -d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was then added and the cultures were induced for 16 h at 289 K. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 rev min \u00c01 for 10 min) and resuspended in PBS buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1.8 mM KH 2 PO 4 pH 7.3) supplemented with 1 mM DTT. After sonication at 277 K, the lysate was centrifuged at 15 000 rev min \u00c01 for 30 min at 277 K and the precipitate was discarded. The recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, namely the GST-nsp2 N-terminal domain, was obtained in the supernatant. The supernatant was then loaded onto 2 ml GST-glutathione affinity columns (GE Healthcare) and the GST tag was cleaved by Pre-Scission protease (GE Healthcare) to produce the nsp2 N-terminal domain. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed using Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare, USA) in 20 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT pH 6.0. The purified protein was concentrated to 20 mg ml \u00c01 by ultracentrifugation and was ready for crystallization screening.",
