In addition, based on the worldwide information from the Covid-19 pandemic, some characteristics of the population at higher risk for Covid-19 have been identified, such as being older people, those with hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and CVD, and patients with respiratory diseases or conditions.",

Initiating a sudden quarantine state implies a radical change in the lifestyle of the population. These lifestyles and behaviors in many cases include a certain level of physical activity (PA) and exercise to maintain an adequate health status (1), to counteract the negative consequences of certain diseases (2), such as diabetes, hypertension, CVD, respiratory diseases, or even simply to guarantee an active aging by reducing the risk of frailty, sarcopenia and dementia, as associated diseases in older people (3, 4) . Moreover, the psychological impact of quarantine has been recently reviewed (5) and negative psychological effects, including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger has been reported. The stressor factors suggested included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma.",

In fact, exercise has been considered the real polypill based on epidemiological evidence of its preventive/therapeutic benefits and considering the main biological mediators involved (1, 7, 9) . Special attention is deserved for the elderly population group, because in older people PA and exercise impact the mentioned benefits on many diseases but also has additional effects on hallmarks of aging and associated diseases (10) . In this sense, exercise in older people positively affects and prevents frailty, sarcopenia/dynapenia, risk of falls, self-esteem and cognitive impairment or decline (10, 11) . Therefore, to not totally interrupt or change the lifestyle of people during quarantine and to maintain an active lifestyle at home is very important for the health of the overall population but, especially, for those with additional risk factors and older people.",

Clearly, we would support the message of \"doing at least some exercise is better than nothing\", however, a more precise prescription and recommendation are needed to guarantee an appropriate J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f exercise program aimed to maintain or improve the principal health-related physical fitness components. Briefly, the reason to promote PA and exercise for improving physical fitness components is that these (cardiorespiratory fitness or CRF, muscular strength, coordination-agility) are directly related with the physiological functions of the main organ systems (respiratory, circulatory, muscular, nervous and skeletal systems) and indirectly implicated in the appropriate functioning of other systems (endocrine, digestive, immune or renal systems) (1) (2) (3) (4) 7, 9) . These relationships are even more interesting from the point of view of physiologic functional reserve of organ systems, for example, to increase the CRF is not only directly related with improvements in the circulatory and respiratory systems capacities but also with increases in its functional reserve. For all this, PA/exercise become especially essential for older people during quarantine because to maintain physiological function and reserve of most of the organ systems could contribute to the fight against the mental and physical consequences and severity of Covid-19.
