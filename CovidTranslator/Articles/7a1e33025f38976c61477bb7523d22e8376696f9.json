            "text": "The majority of the significant human pathogenic viruses have RNA genomes. Hepatitis C, influenza, measles, yellow fever, dengue, Lassa, and Ebola hemorrhagic fevers are but a few examples of diseases caused by RNA viruses that are responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. However, studies on the molecular biology of viruses with RNA genomes were hampered for many years by the inherent limitations imposed by the nature of the genetic material. For instance, RNA is biochemically more labile than DNA, and techniques to produce precisely defined nucleotide alterations directly on RNA molecules are not available. The history of RNA virus \"reverse genetics\" [now usually defined as the ability to recover or rescue infectious virus from complementary DNA (cDNA)I can be traced back just over 20 years to the report by Taniguchi et al. on recovery of an RNA bacteriophage, Qp, from cloned cDNA in 1978. This achievement was followed a few years later by the recovery of the first animal virus, poliovirus, from transfected cDNA by Racaniello and Baltimore (1981) . These viruses have positive-strand RNA genomes, and during the 1980s systems were refined so that reverse genetic studies on many other positive-strand RNA viruses were initiated, which revolutionized dissection of their replication processes. In contrast, the development of analogous techniques for negative-strand RNA viruses was slower, partly because neither genome nor antigenome RNA is infectious per se unlike positive-strand viruses. The negative-sense viral RNA is assembled with the viral nucleocapsid protein into a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, and it is the RNP that is the template for all RNA synthetic events and the initiation of infection; reconstitution of RNP complexes from isolated components proved to be technically demanding. A system to manipulate individual influenza A virus genome segments was reported in 1989 by Luytjes et al., although it was not until 1994 that the first negative-strand RNA virus, the nonsegmented rabies virus, was recovered entirely from cDNA (Schnell et al., 1994) . Since then a number of other negative-strand viruses have been rescued from cloned Thus we have reached an exciting stage in RNA virology in which reverse genetic systems are available for most major virus groups, and it seems appropriate to review the progress and applications of this technology. The articles in this section present overviews of the reverse genetics for different groups of RNA viruses, highlighting how their different replication strategies have shaped the particular reverse genetic approach developed. The first four articles are devoted to positivestrand RNA viruses. Ruggli and Rice describe the progress made with the Flaviviridae and emphasize particular problems encountered in constructing functional cDNA clones. Evans reviews progress in the picornavirus field, with recovery of virus from cDNA-derived RNA transcripts now being regarded as a \"standard technique in the molecular analysis of any picornavirus.\" In the third article in this section, Ball and Johnson describe how the relatively unknown nodavirus can be manipulated, with potential as an expression vector, and in the fourth article, Masters describes approaches used to manipulate coronavirus genomes, which are among the largest RNA molecules known in biology.",

Neumann and Kawaoka review the segmented genome negative-strand viruses; Roberts and Rose describe the manipulation of rhabdovirus genomes and their potential for vaccines and vaccine vectors; and Marriott and Easton review progress made with paramyxoviruses. These articles highlight the remarkable achievements made in understanding aspects of viral replication that were previously unattainable. Two articles deal with dsRNA viruses. Mindich discusses bacteriophage Q6, particularly the elegant studies on genome packaging, and Roner reviews progress made in manipulating dsRNA viruses of higher organisms, which for the reoviruses presents a severe challenge. Finally, Bendahmane and Beachy describe the practical application of reverse genetics for the control of plant virus infections. The authors provide comprehensive accounts of the state of play in reverse genetics of RNA viruses, which I hope will be the stimulus for further groundbreaking developments in the study of this class of pathogen.",
