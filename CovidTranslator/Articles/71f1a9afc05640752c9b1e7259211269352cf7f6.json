            "text": "The principal component analysis based on the physicochemical properties of amino acid residues is applied to DNA and RNA polymerases to assign the sequence motifs for the polymerization activities of these proteins. After the reconfirmation of the sequence motifs of families A and B of DNA polymerases indicated previously, it elucidates the sequence motifs for the polymerization activity of DNA polymerase III (family C) by the similarity to the polymerization center of multimeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases. This identification proceeds to clarify the sequence motifs for polymerization activities of primases; eukaryotic and archaebacterial primases carry motifs similar to those of family C, while the motifs of eubacterial primase fall into the category of the motifs in family B DNA polymerases such as K, N, O and II. This finding means that DNA dependent RNA polymerases are also divided into groups corresponding to three families, A, B and C, because the monomeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases in phages are reconfirmed to carry sequence motifs similar to those of family A DNA polymerases. Furthermore, the three families of polymerization motifs are found to fall within the variation range of polymerization motifs displayed by many RNA dependent RNA polymerases, suggesting a close evolutionary relation between them. The sequence motifs for polymerization activities of reverse transcriptase and telomerase seem to be the intermediate between family A DNA polymerase and some RNA dependent RNA polymerases, e.g., from Leviviridae. On the contrary, the sequence fragments similar to the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily including DNA polymerase L are not found in any RNA dependent RNA polymerase, suggesting their other lineage of polymerization motifs. \u00df 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

            "text": "Since the three-dimensional structure of the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I has been determined by X-ray di\u00a1raction analysis [1] , much attention has been paid to reveal the sequence characteristics responsible for polymerization activity as well as those for exonuclease activity. The simplest way for this purpose is to \u00a2nd conserved amino acid residues in the structure by the homologous alignment of polypeptide chains exhibiting a similar function. In the early trials along this line, sequence motifs similar to those in the Klenow fragment were found in the DNA dependent DNA polymerases from bacteriophages T7 [2, 3] and T5 [4] , as well as in DNA polymerases I from Thermus aquaticus [5] and Streptococcus pneumoniae [6] , leading to the proposal of the sequence motifs for polymerization activity of the \u00a2rst family of polymerases. As the second family, human DNA polymerase K has been indicated to carry sequence fragments similar to those in viral DNA dependent DNA polymerases [7] . The sequence similarity between DNA polymerase L and terminal transferase has also been proposed to constitute another family [8, 9] . Uni\u00a2cation of the sequence fragments responsible for polymerization activities of these families of DNA polymerases and some RNA dependent RNA polymerases was also attempted [10] , but this attempt only focused on the presence of aspartic acid residues in the two motifs A and C. In parallel, the sequence motifs for 3P-5P exonuclease activity of E. coli DNA polymerase I have also been characterized by comparison with other amino acid sequences exhibiting similar exonuclease activity [11] , and the conserved regions for 5P-3P exonuclease activity of E. coli DNA polymerase I are suggested from comparison with the amino acid sequences of DNA polymerases I from other species of eubacteria [12] .",

However, this classi\u00a2cation is mainly based on the sequence similarity scores evaluated with the use of the FASTA program developed by Pearson and Lipman [15, 16] . Recently, the determination of tertiary structures is extended to T7 bacteriophage DNA dependent RNA polymerase [17] and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase [18] , suggesting their structural similarity to the polymerization domain of DNA polymerase I, although a considerable similarity score is not counted between them by the FASTA program. In practice, the FASTA program is not sensitive to detect conserved sequence fragments such as the sequence motifs for polymerization activity, which are distributed with di\u00a1erent intervals in the primary structures of di\u00a1erent types of polymerases.",

The application of this method not only recon\u00a2rms the previously indicated sequence motifs for polymerization activities of families A and B of DNA polymerases but also assigns the sequence motifs for polymerization activity of DNA polymerase III by the similarity to the polymerization center of multimeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases. This assignment resolves the problem of an apparent di\u00a1erence between eukaryotic and eubacterial primases; the sequence fragments similar to polymerization motifs of family C are found in the smallest subunit of eukaryotic primase while the eubacterial primase carries the sequence fragments similar to family B polymerization motifs.

The values of these properties are listed for every kind of amino acid in Table 1 . The samples, for which the principal component analysis is carried out, are chosen to be polypeptide fragments, each consisting of \u00a2ve amino acid residues. Although 20 5 kinds of polypeptide fragments are generally considerable in this size of polypeptide fragments, it is su\u00a4cient for the present purpose to choose a data set of 36 205 polypeptide fragments that are collected from the amino acid sequences of 45 representative polymerases including four families A, B, C and X of DNA polymerases, multimeric and monomeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases, RNA dependent RNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases. Each of the polypeptide fragments thus obtained is numerically characterized by the four kinds of physicochemical properties, each property being taken as an average value over the \u00a2ve constituent amino acid residues. The correlation matrix of the four variables calculated for this data set, {x ij } (i = 1, 2, 3, 4; j = 1, 2, 3, 4), is shown in Table 2 . An eigenvalue problem is then solved for this matrix, and the eigenvalues and percentages of inertia thus obtained are listed in Table 3 . Because the percentage of inertia corresponding to the \u00a2rst principal component is 52.7%, a main feature of variation in the samples of used polypeptide fragments may be approximately represented by the \u00a2rst principal component. By this procedure, the coe\u00a4cients, with which the \u00a2rst principal component is expressed by a linear combination of standardized variables, are calculated to be a 1 = 0.6193, a [22] . b Cited from Nozaki and Tanford [23] . c Cited from Barker [24] . when the average polarity, hydrophobicity, volume and pK a values of the \u00a2ve amino acid residues constituting the fragment are inserted into the four variables x k1 , x k2 , x k3 and x k4 , respectively, in this equation. Here, the mean value and variance of each variable in the data set are: x 1 8X41, c 11 = 1.18, x 2 0X75, c 22 = 0.14, x 3 81X88, c 33 = 283.53, x 4 2X66 and c 44 = 3.69. Approximately, this representation gives a higher positive value of z 1 for the sequence fragment of hydrophilic amino acid residues and a negative value for hydrophobic residues. However, the most important advantage of this representation should be that it re\u00a3ects di\u00a1erent physicochemical properties and thus can predict active centers on the basis of more detailed structural properties than the hydropathy analysis. Such evaluation is made progressively for the successive polypeptide fragments of \u00a2ve sites overlapping by four from the N to the C terminus along a polypeptide chain. For homologously aligned sequences, z 1 values are each evaluated for each of the polypeptide fragments aligned homologously, and the standard deviation width around the average value of them is plotted against the middle sites of the respective fragments along the polypeptide chain. The narrower width of standard deviation means a higher degree of conservation of amino acid residues.",

In practice, this type of DNA polymerase consists of many subunits. For example, the DNA polymerase Recently, a third type of DNA polymerase III is found in cyanobacteria, but its available amino acid sequence of the K subunit from Synechocystis is highly similar to that of the K subunit of E. coli-type DNA polymerase III in sequence length as well as in individual amino acid residues. Thus, this sequence is also treated as E. coli type in the present study. The amino acid sequences of each type of subunit are aligned homologously, and the z 1 diagram is constructed. The comparison of the z 1 diagrams and of amino acid sequences ascertains the amino acid sequence fragments to be similar to those of Exo I, Exo II and Exo III iden-ti\u00a2ed in families A and B of DNA polymerases [11,28^30] in the O subunit of E. coli-type DNA polymerase III and in the region of the K subunit of B. subtilis-type DNA polymerase III, which follows the phosphoesterase domain in the N-terminal region of the K subunit indicated previously [31] . . Furthermore, at least \u00a2ve regions are found to carry amino acid residues highly conserved between E. coli and B. subtilis types of K subunits, and they are tentatively denoted by a, b, c, d and e. This is shown in Fig. 1a by the comparison of z 1 diagrams and in Fig. 1b by the homologous alignment of amino acid sequences. Although the amino acid sequence fragments identical to those in motifs A, B and C of families A and B of DNA polymerases cannot be found in any of the regions a, b, c, d and e, the amino acid sequence fragments responsible for polymerase activity must be contained in these conserved regions. In practice, our systematic similarity search \u00a2nds that these regions contain the amino acid sequence fragments conserved in the largest subunits of multimeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases. Thus, we will describe the amino acid sequence fragments conserved in the DNA dependent RNA polymerases before going into the assignment of the sequence fragments responsible for the polymerization activity of DNA polymerase III.",

Moreover, the largest subunit 1 shows considerable similarity to the AP plus AQ subunits of DNA dependent RNA polymerase in archaebacteria and the LP subunit of DNA dependent RNA poly- Amino acid residues conserved in both the O subunit of the E. coli type and the K subunit of the B. subtilis type correspond to the sequence motifs similar to those for 3P-5P exonuclease activity identi\u00a2ed in families A and B of DNA polymerases [11,28^30] . The other \u00a2ve regions, each of which contains the amino acid residues highly conserved in the K subunits of both types of DNA polymerases III, are denoted a, b, c, d and e, respectively. Identical and similar amino acid residues between the two types of DNA polymerases III are boxed and denoted by the category numbers, respectively. (c) Proposal of the sequence motifs for polymerization activity of DNA polymerase III by the similarity to the conserved regions among the largest subunits of multimeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases; LP subunit (RPOC) of E. coli RNA polymerase, Q (RPOG) and N (RPOD) subunits of Synechocystis RNA polymerase, largest subunits (RPA1, RPB1 and RPC1) of eukaryotic RNA polymerases I, II and III, AP (RPAP) and AQ (RPAQ) subunits of archaebacterial RNA polymerase. As for the homologous alignment of these RNA polymerases, see merase in eubacteria such as B. subtilis, M. genitalium, Mycobacterium leprae, E. coli and Pseudomonas putida. In the DNA dependent RNA polymerases from cyanobacteria (e.g., Synechocystis sp.), the two subunits, Q and N, correspond to the LP subunit, and such splitting of the largest subunit into two pieces is also seen in the DNA dependent RNA polymerase encoded in the chloroplast genome. These similarities to the largest subunits 1 are shown in Fig. 2a by comparing the z 1 diagrams of the respective types of polypeptide chains. As seen in this \u00a2gure, at least \u00a2ve regions are found to show high similarities between subunit 1, AP plus AP subunits, LP subunit, and Q plus N subunits, and these regions will be tentatively denoted as aP, bP, cP, dP and eP. The homologous alignment of amino acid sequences in each of these \u00a2ve regions is shown in Fig. 2b . Among the \u00a2ve regions, region bP contains the amino acid sequence fragment NADFDGDQ/EM that is suggested to be the polymerization active center of E. coli DNA dependent RNA polymerase [32] . Such an Asp-rich sequence fragment is also present in region b of the K subunit of DNA polymerase III, as seen in Fig. 1b . Moreover, considerable similarities of amino acid sequences are also found between regions c and d of the K subunit of DNA polymerase III and regions cP and dP of RNA polymerases, although no marked similarity is found either between regions a and aP or between regions e and eP. The direct comparison of the amino acid sequences in these regions is given in Fig. 1c , where the amino acid sequences of regions b, c and d of E. coli-and B. subtilis-type DNA polymerases III are aligned vertically relative to those of regions bP, cP and dP of RNA polymerases, respectively. In this comparison of amino acid sequences, it is found that the amino acid sequence fragments DFD-D are conserved in regions b and bP, G---G in regions c and cP, and L---D in regions d and dP. Although the third aspartic acid residue in region b of B. subtilis-type DNA polymerase III is replaced by an asparagine residue with a similar size of side chain, the presence of three aspartic acid residues in the \u00a2rst and third regions may be su\u00a4cient for forming the polymerization center suspending two metal ions, by analogy with the motifs indicated in families A and B of DNA polymerases. Thus, the amino acid sequence fragments in regions b, c and d will be proposed as the sequence motifs for the polymerization activity of the family C of DNA polymerases, being named as A C , B C and C C . In fact, the two aspartic acid residues, Asp-401 and Asp-403, in motif A C are also inspected to be the key residues in the active site for polymerization by the recent approach to the K subunit of DNA polymerase III from E. coli [33] , and more recently these aspartic acid residues and Asp-555 in motif C C are indicated to chelate magnesium ions by site-directed mutagenesis [34] . Furthermore, the amino acid residues R/K--G-H-GG conserved in motif B C of two types of DNA polymerase III seem to be comparable to the residues K------(-)YG in motif B of families A and B of DNA polymerases. The sequence motifs for polymerization activity of DNA dependent RNA polymerases may also reside in regions bP, cP and dP which are vertically aligned with motifs A C , B C and C C proposed for the polymerization activity of DNA polymerase III, although the residues conserved in the region corresponding to B C of DNA polymerase III are reduced to G^R/KG with the deletion of one site in DNA dependent RNA polymerases.

This comparison found that the eubacterial primases carry sequence fragments similar to the sequence motifs for polymerization activity of family B DNA polymerases. To illustrate this, the sequence pattern and amino acid sequences of eubacterial primases are compared with those of the polymerization domains of DNA polymerases N and K in Fig. 4a and b , respectively, where the three sequence motifs for polymerization activity identi\u00a2ed already in family B DNA polymerases are denoted by A B , B B and C B .

This type of bacteriophage RNA polymerase also shows high similarity to the monomeric DNA dependent RNA polymerase for transcribing the genes encoded in the mitochondrial DNA (e.g., an optimal score of 708 between bacteriophage T3 RNA polymerase and yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase). In practice, the homologous alignment of phage RNA polymerase and mitochondrial RNA polymerase is already carried out with the indication of 11 conserved domains, I^XI [44] . For the recon\u00a2rmation of these previous indications, z 1 diagrams are constructed for four species of bacter-iophages RNA polymerases, two species of mitochondrial RNA polymerases and seven species of DNA polymerase I. These diagrams are compared in Fig. 5a , and the homologous alignment of their amino acid sequences in the region which seems to be responsible for the polymerization activity is shown in Fig. 5b . In these \u00a2gures, the sequence motifs proposed for the polymerization activity of DNA polymerase I [2^6,10] are denoted by A A , B A and C A .

Although only two aspartic acid residues, one in motif AP and another in motif CP, were noted in the previous alignment of RNA dependent RNA polymerases from a few species to family A DNA polymerases [10] , our systematic comparison of much more sequence data reveals that RNA dependent RNA polymerases are full of variety encompassing the sequence motifs of three families A, B and C of polymerases; the number of aspartic acid residues varies from one to three in motif AP, one to two in motif CP, and categories 1 and 4 of amino acid residues, in addition to the conserved glycine, tend to appear in motif BP.

The amino acid sequences of now available RNA dependent DNA polymerases from viruses are classi\u00a2ed into three groups by the criterion of similarity scores of more than 200 evaluated with the FASTA program. These groups correspond to those from Caulimoviridae, Lentivirinae and Oncovirinae, respectively.

Although the z 1 diagrams of the three groups are considerably di\u00a1erent from each other, a careful comparison of these diagrams detects three regions, each of which shows a similar sequence pattern among the three groups.

            "text": "The sequence patterns of these three regions are compared between telomerase and the three groups of reverse transcriptases in Fig. 7a , and their amino acid sequence fragments are compared in Fig. 7b . As seen in Fig. 7b , the \u00a2rst, second and third regions contain conserved sequence fragments D, P-G and DD, respectively, in all groups of reverse transcriptases and telomerases. From the tertiary structure of reverse transcriptase from human immunode\u00a2ciency virus HIV-1 (Lentivirinae), the N-terminal aspartic acid residue in the \u00a2rst region and two aspartic acid residues in the third region are suggested to be stereochemically arranged to highlight the relative position of the`catalytic triad' accepting a divalent cation in a similar way to the polymerase active center of the Klenow fragment [48] . Moreover, Asp-530 in the \u00a2rst region of telomerase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is suggested to play an essential role in telomerase activity by mutational study [49] . However, it should be noted that the amino acid residues conserved in the third region are DD just like those in motif CP of RNA dependent RNA polymerases from most viruses, in contrast to HDE conserved in motif C A of family A DNA polymerases. The amino acid residues conserved in the second region are also di\u00a1erent from those conserved in motif B A of family A DNA polymerases. Thus, the amino acid sequence fragments in the three regions of these reverse transcriptases will be denoted as motifs AQ, BQ and CQ, respectively, in Fig. 7a and b, being distinguished from those of family A DNA polymerases. Motifs AQ, BQ and CQ all locate on the border from hydrophilic to hydrophobic parts, and, in this sense, the environmental structure of these motifs may be similar to that of DNA dependent DNA polymerases rather than that of RNA dependent RNA polymerases. Thus, reverse transcriptase may be an intermediate between RNA dependent RNA polymerase and family A of DNA dependent DNA polymerase. The similarity of sequence motifs for polymerization of nucleotides and deoxynucleotides has also been suggested for poly(A) polymerase, tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, DNA polymerase L and deoxynucleotidyltransferase [50] . In order to ascertain this suggestion, we constructed z 1 diagrams separately for eukaryotic poly(A) polymerases, eubacterial poly(A) polymerases, eubacterial and eukaryotic tRNA nucleotidyltransferases, archaebacterial tRNA nucleotidyltransferases, DNA polymerase L and deoxynucleotidyltransferase. These z 1 diagrams are compared in Fig. 8a , and the six types of amino acid sequences in the regions showing a similar sequence pattern are vertically aligned in Fig. 8b . Curiously, the largest number of identical and/or similar properties of amino acid residues are shared between eubacterial poly(A) polymerase and eubacterial tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. In fact, a high similarity score of 280 is counted between E. coli tRNA nucleotidyltransferase and B. subtilis poly(A) polymerase by the FASTA program, while the similarity of eubacterial poly(A) polymerase to eukaryotic poly(A) polymerase is not as high as the similarity between eubacterial and eukaryotic tRNA nucleotidyltransferases, e.g., the optimal score calculated between E. coli poly(A) polymerase and Candida albicans poly(A) polymerase is only 42. At any rate, several amino acid residues are found to be conserved in all available amino acid sequences of poly(A) polymerases and tRNA nucleotidyltransferases. Among them, we can \u00a2nd the three aspartic acid residues that are also conserved in DNA polymerase L and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. These three aspartic acid residues correspond to those indicated to be essential for the catalysis of mammalian poly(A) polymerase by mutational analysis [50] . In rat DNA polymerase L, Asp-190, Asp-192 and Asp-256 are indicated to suspend magnesium ions in site A and site B [51] . Thus, the two regions containing the two and one aspartic acid residues are denoted as motifs A X and C X , respectively, in Fig.  8a and b, according to the family name of DNA polymerase L.",

Certainly, these glycine and serine residues are conserved in terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferases as well as DNA polymerases L from di\u00a1erent species. However, the residues corresponding to Tyr-271 and Asp-276 are not found in DNA polymerases L from human and S. cerevisiae while Arg as well as Asn are conserved. In particular, it should be noted that Arg belongs to the same category as Lys. Thus, the sequence fragment TGS---N---R conserved in DNA polymerase L and deoxynucleotidyltransferase is denoted as motif B X in Fig. 8b . Although the arrangements of these three motifs A X , B X and C X as well as of the amino acid residues in motif B X are di\u00a1erent from those in other families of DNA polymerases, the tertiary structure of the polymerization domain of DNA polymerase L is known to be quite di\u00a1erent from the structures of families A and B of DNA polymerases, as will be discussed in Section 4.",

The 5P-3P exonuclease activity is known in the N-terminal fragments of eubacterial polymerases I [12] , 5P-3P exonucleases from T-phages and \u00a3ap endonuclease [52] . Furthermore, the N-terminal fragment of DNA polymerase I shows considerable similarity to exonuclease, DNA repair proteins, RAD2, RAD13, RAD27 and XP-G, and DNA damage inducible protein DIN7 as well as \u00a3ap endonuclease, all of which are called the XP-G/ RAD2 family [53] . The comparison of z 1 diagrams and the homologous alignment of these polypeptide chains show that the amino acid residues conserved in the six regions A^F of DNA polymerase I indicated previously [12] are also found in the XP-G/ RAD2 family. However, the conservation of amino acid residues is hardly observed in regions B and C, when the sequence comparison is advanced to the 5P-3P exonucleases of T-phages. Although regions C and F are suggested to be required for 5P-3P exonuclease activity from the mutations of DNA polymerase I defective in this activity [52, 54] , the present comparison of three groups of proteins strongly suggests that regions A, D, E and F are essential for 5P-3P exonuclease activity. In practice, the recent results of X-ray di\u00a1raction analyses on DNA polymerase I from T. aquaticus [55] and on 5P-3P exodeoxyribonuclease from bacteriophage T5 [56] indicate that the aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues in these four regions are associated with the suspension of manganese and zinc ions, although the number of suspended metal ions is reported to be three in DNA polymerase I in contrast to two in exodeoxyribonuclease.

            "text": "The structural similarity of polymerization domains between DNA dependent DNA polymerase, DNA dependent RNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase is already indicated for DNA polymerase I, T7 bacteriophage monomeric DNA dependent RNA polymerase and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase; motifs A (A A and AQ in our notation) and C (C A and CQ) form three strands of a L sheet and a short segment of K-helix within the core of the palm subdomain and motif B (B A and BQ) is located in the \u00a2ngers domain [18, 48, 57] . As ascertained in the present investigation, the polymerases showing a similar tertiary structure also carry similar sequence motifs for polymerization, although a considerable similarity score is not necessarily counted between them by the current method such as the FASTA program. Although T7 phage DNA dependent RNA polymerase carries extra 1 and 2 regions in comparison with DNA polymerase I, this may be reasonable because the DNA dependent RNA polymerase should be capable of sequence speci\u00a2c (promoter) DNA binding and template unwinding. The recently determined structure of bacteriophage RB69 DNA polymerase, which is considered to be homologous to DNA pol-ymerase K, also shows a similar palm subdomain containing motifs A (A B ) and C (C B ), but its thumb subdomain is topologically di\u00a1erent from that of family A polymerases and its \u00a2ngers subdomain is simpler [58] . In practice, the number of sites between motifs B B and C B is smaller in DNA polymerase K than in DNA polymerase I, and this is also the case in eubacterial primase. With this di\u00a1erence of tertiary structures, the similar sequence motifs for polymerization activities of families A and B of DNA Fig. 9 . Similarity relationships of DNA and RNA polymerases, mainly based on the similar amino acid sequences in the polymerase domains. The polymerases within the same box show the optimal score of more than 200 by the FASTA program, and carry almost the same sequence motifs for polymerization. Furthermore, DNA dependent RNA polymerases are also divided into four types according to their similarities to sequence motifs for polymerization activities of families A, B, C and X of DNA dependent DNA polymerases, i.e., monomeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases to family A, eubacterial primases to family B, eukaryotic and archaebacterial primases and multimeric RNA polymerases to family C, and poly(A) polymerases and tRNA nucleotidyltransferases to family X, although the FASTA program does not count a considerable similarity score between these DNA and RNA polymerases. The variety of sequence motifs for polymerization activities of RNA dependent RNA polymerases encompasses the polymerization motifs characteristics of family A, B and C polymerases as well as the sequence motifs for polymerization activities of reverse transcriptase including telomerase, while the sequence fragment similar to the family X polymerization motif is not found in any RNA dependent RNA polymerase. In contrast to the variation in sequence motifs for polymerization activities, the sequence motifs for 3P-5P exonuclease activity are mostly common to families A, B and C of DNA dependent DNA polymerases, and the sequence motifs for 5P-3P exonuclease activity present in DNA polymerase I are highly similar to those in the XPG/RAD2 family of proteins and those in 5P-3P exonucleases from bacteriophages. These similarity relations of sequence motifs for polymerization and/or exonuclease activities are represented by the connection with a straight line. Proteins surrounded by two dotted lines are those encoded in the genomes of free living organisms. polymerases have been proposed as an example of convergence [58] . However, this proposal seems too narrow to consider the evolution of polymerases. Although the study of crystal structure does not reach DNA polymerase III and multimeric DNA dependent RNA polymerase yet, it is true that the relative position of the three motifs is the same in the three families A, B and C of polymerases, reverse transcriptases including HVI-1 transcriptase show a similar sequence pattern to RNA dependent RNA polymerases and some of the RNA dependent RNA polymerases carry sequence motifs similar to those of family C polymerases. These facts seem to support the possibility that the polymerization domains of these three families of polymerases are homologous, because they could have diverged by insertion and/or deletion of some amino acid sequence fragments and some degree of substitutions. In this sense, the RNA dependent RNA polymerases as well as families A, B and C of DNA dependent DNA and RNA polymerases may be clustered as a superfamily of nucleic acid polymerase.",

            "text": "In contrast to the variation in the amino acid se-quence fragments responsible for polymerization activities, the sequence motifs for 3P-5P exonuclease activity are almost the same in all DNA dependent DNA polymerases of families A, B and C, although this activity is lost in DNA polymerase K and DNA polymerases I from many species of eubacteria except for E. coli and H. in\u00a3uenzae. The sequence motifs for 5P-3P exonuclease activity carried by DNA polymerase I are essentially the same as those in the 5P-3P exonucleases of bacteriophages and in the eukaryotic proteins clustered in the XP-G/RAD2 family. Thus, most processive DNA dependent DNA polymerases would have been generated by the fusion of 3P-5P and/or 5P-3P exonuclease domains to the polymerization domains after their di\u00a1erentiation into the three types. In practice, the editing 3P-5P exonuclease domain of T7 bacteriophage RB69 is homologous to that of E. coli DNA polymerase I but lies on the opposite side of the polymerization active site [58] . The presence of phosphoesterase in both the K subunit of DNA polymerase III and DNA polymerase L [31] may also be due to the result of domain fusion.",
