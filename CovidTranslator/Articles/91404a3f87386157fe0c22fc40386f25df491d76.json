            "text": "Ebola virus (EboV) belongs to the Filoviridae family of viruses that causes severe and fatal hemhorragic fever. Infection by EboV involves fusion between the virus and host cell membranes mediated by the envelope glycoprotein GP2 of the virus. Similar to the envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, the central feature of the GP2 ectodomain postfusion structure is a six-helix bundle formed by the protein's N-and C-heptad repeat regions (NHR and CHR, respectively). Folding of this six-helix bundle provides the energetic driving force for membrane fusion; in other viruses, designed agents that disrupt formation of the six-helix bundle act as potent fusion inhibitors. To interrogate determinants of EboV GP2-mediated membrane fusion, we designed model proteins that consist of the NHR and CHR segments linked by short protein linkers. Circular dichroism and gel filtration studies indicate that these proteins adopt stable ahelical folds consistent with design. Thermal denaturation indicated that the GP2 six-helix bundle is highly stable at pH 5.3 (melting temperature, T m , of 86.8 6 2.0\u00b0C and van't Hoff enthalpy, DH vH , of 228.2 6 1.0 kcal/mol) and comparable in stability to other viral membrane fusion six-helix bundles. We found that the stability of our designed a-helical bundle proteins was dependent on buffering conditions with increasing stability at lower pH. Small pH differences (5.3-6.1) had dramatic effects (DT m 5 37\u00b0C) suggesting a mechanism for conformational control that is dependent on environmental pH. These results suggest a role for low pH in stabilizing six-helix bundle formation during the process of GP2-mediated viral membrane fusion.",

            "text": "The transmembrane envelope glycoproteins of many viruses use simple a-helical bundle motifs to facilitate fusion between the virus and host membranes during infection. [1] [2] [3] (Historically, envelope glycopro-teins have been categorized according to structural features with a-helical bundle proteins comprising the so-called ''class I'' family. 2 ) In the general model for membrane fusion, folding of a six-helix bundle by the glycoprotein ectodomain provides the driving force for bringing the two bilayers together. [1] [2] [3] The prototypic six-helix bundle formed by the N-and Cheptad repeat (NHR and CHR) regions from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmembrane envelope glycoprotein gp41 has been particularly instructive for understanding this mechanism (Fig. 1 ). [4] [5] [6] The primary sequence of gp41 contains a hydrophobic N-terminal fusion peptide (FP), the ectodomain containing the NHR and CHR, and a transmembrane domain that anchors the glycoprotein to the virus. Following receptor binding by the surface glycoprotein (gp120), the FP of gp41 embeds in the membrane of the host cell giving rise to a transient trimeric intermediate known as the ''extended'' or ''prehairpin'' intermediate that spans both the virus and cell membranes and in which the NHR and CHR segments are exposed [ Fig. 1(A) ]. Next, folding of the NHR and CHR into the six-helix bundle forces the two anchored membranes into proximity, which promotes mixing and, ultimately, formation of a fusion pore. This process likely proceeds via a hemifusion intermediate, in which the outer leaflets are fused but the inner leaflets are not, and it is thought that the transition from this hemifusion intermediate to the fusion pore represents the rate-limiting step during entry. 1 Transmembrane glycoproteins from other viruses such as Ebola virus (EboV) (GP2) and influenza A virus Figure 1 . A: General mechanism of viral membrane fusion catalyzed by a-helical bundle containing ectodomains. In both HIV-1 and EboV, the prefusion assembly consists of a dimer of trimers containing a surface subunit (SU, gp120 for HIV-1 and GP1 for EboV) and the transmembrane subunit that contains the NHR and CHR regions (TM, gp41 for HIV-1 and GP2 for EboV). In both cases a ''trigger'' leads to insertion of the N-terminal fusion peptide (FP) into the cell membrane resulting in the extended or prehairpin intermediate in which the NHR (cyan) and CHR (blue) are exposed to the environment. Folding of the six-helix bundle juxtaposes the two membranes and ultimately leads to their coalescence. Agents that bind the extended/ prehairpin intermediate and prevent six-helix bundle formation have been shown to act as potent antiviral agents in HIV-1 (fusion inhibitors). B: Postfusion conformations of HIV-1 gp41 (PDB ID 1AIK) and EboV GP2 ectodomains solved by the Wiley (PDB ID 1EBO) and Kim groups (PDB ID 2EBO). The NHR and CHR elements are colored as in panel A; the Wiley GP2 construct contained an N-terminal trimeric GCN4 segment which is shown in green. The six-helix bundle of EboV GP2 is boxed on the structure reported by Kim and coworkers.",

The structure described by Kim and coworkers 9 was of a protease stable 74-residue fragment encompassing residues 557-630 (Zaire ebolavirus numbering, ''Ebo-74''). The structure reported by Wiley and coworkers 8 contained residues 552-650 of the ectodomain linked to a N-terminal trimeric GCN4 coiled-coil domain to promote solubility and stability (pIIGp2(552-650)). The GP2 ectodomain regions in these two structures were in good agreement and revealed several unique features of the ahelical bundle. The EboV GP2 six-helix bundle is much shorter than that of HIV-1 gp41, consisting of segments containing just three a-helical turns each in the NHR and CHR regions compared to seven turns for these regions in gp41. The region linking the NHR and CHR in GP2 contains a short helixturn-helix motif that is stabilized by an intramolecular disulfide bond. Interestingly, this motif is structurally similar to that found in the moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) glycoprotein postfusion core despite the fact that these viruses are not phylogenetically related. 8, 9, 13 Sequence homology suggests that analogous regions in the envelope glycoproteins of avian sarcoma/leukosis virus (ASLV) and human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1) adopt similar structures, and mutational studies suggest that a histidine residue in this region plays a role in pH-dependent ASLV viral entry. 14 In EboV GP2, the helix-turn-helix motif appears to contribute to overall stability as the native disulfide bond pairing is required for high thermostability. 9 Another feature of EboV GP2 is the presence of a ''stutter'' in the heptad repeat pattern in the NHR core, noted by both the Kim and Wiley groups. Typical a-helical bundle proteins contain a characteristic abcdefg repeat where a and d positions are occupied by hydrophobic residues (the 3-4 repeat). 15 In the NHR region of GP2, there is a stutter in this hydrophobic repeat at position T565 that results in a 3-4-4-3 repeat pattern; a similar stutter exists at the N-terminal end of the low-pH induced influenza A virus HA2 coiled-coil. 16 Finally, the central NHR coiledcoil contains an anion binding pocket that also appears to contribute to folding stability. These features make the EboV GP2 a-helical bundle an interesting system to study in the context of factors that are required to drive membrane fusion.",

[17] [18] [19] [20] Furthermore, appropriately designed protein mimics of the gp41 extended intermediate serve as targets for neutralizing antibodies and thus have potential as immunogens for vaccine discovery. [21] [22] [23] [24] In theory, similar approaches could be adopted for EboV GP2, given the similarity in their proposed fusion mechanisms. 25 Our goal was to design protein mimics of the a-helical bundle segment of EboV GP2 that could be used as model systems to study folding stability and potentially aid in development of inhibitors of EboV membrane fusion. To this end, we prepared model proteins consisting of the alternating NHR and CHR segments from EboV GP2 linked by short, flexible loops. Biophysical characterization reveals that these proteins adopt stable a-helical structures consistent with their design. Further analysis provided interesting insights into factors that influence stability of the EboV GP2 six-helix bundle.",

The GP2 postfusion structure is distinct from that of HIV-1 gp41 in that GP2 contains a relatively small six-helix bundle segment but a long, triple stranded core NHR coiled-coil; much of the GP2 postfusion outer layer consists of the helix-turn-helix and loop segments [the six-helix bundle is boxed in Fig. 1(B) ]. 8, 9 By contrast, the long, central NHR trimer of HIV-1 gp41 is surrounded by CHR a-helices of essentially equal length. 5, 6, [26] [27] [28] Previously, Wiley and coworkers 29 performed denaturation studies with pIIGp2(552-650) and found it to be highly thermostable (complete unfolding was not observed on heating to 98 C at pH 8). Kim and coworkers 9 performed denaturation studies with two GP2 ectodomain constructs, a larger 95-residue construct containing essentially the entire GP2 ectodomain (''Ebo-95''), and the protease-resistant Ebo-74. These proteins were also found to be thermostable (thermal midpoint, T m , of 88 C at pH 7.2 for Ebo-95 and 77 C at pH 4.5 for Ebo-74). We wondered what contributions were provided by the GP2 six-helix bundle segment alone (i.e., in the absence of the helix-turn-helix and loop segments). Analysis of folding energetics for sixhelix bundle constructs from HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) gp41 has previously been performed using short hairpin proteins (i.e., a single NHR and a single CHR segment linked by a short linker that form a trimer). 27, 28 However, such proteins typically display concentration-dependent behavior and therefore aggregation complicates thermodynamic analysis. We reasoned that a single chain construct consisting of the EboV GP2 a-helical NHR and CHR segments alone would provide a useful system to examine folding stability of the GP2 six-helix bundle.",

The ectodomain contains two glycosylation sites, these are indicated with an ''o.''

The CD signature (as judged by ratio of signal intensity at 208 and 222 nm) for both proteins was invariant across a 0.2-10 lM concentration range, indicating that a-helix formation was not driven by aggregation. Gel filtration analysis at mid-micromolar protein concentrations (80 lM for Ebo6H and 50 lM for Ebo5H) yielded molecular weight estimates consistent with monomer for each protein, although a small amount of aggregate was observed in both cases [ Fig. 3(B) ]. Ebo6H underwent a cooperative unfolding transition on heating when monitored by CD at 222 nm ( Fig. 3) with T m of 86.8 6 2.0 C at pH 5.3 and 77.8 6 1.6 C at pH 5.8. Ebo5H was less stable than Ebo6H at pH 5.3 (T m \u00bc 80.6 6 0.7 C); therefore, the additional CHR segment in Ebo6H provided 6.2 C of thermal stability under these conditions. The reversibility of unfolding was confirmed by cooling heated samples to room temperature over 5 min; we found the intensity of the 222 nm signal returned to initial values during this process (data not shown).",

For example, low pH triggers dissociation of the surface subunit (HA1) and HA2 subunits of influenza and extension of the central HA2 coiled-coil. 1,3 A pH-de-pendent coil-to-helix transition in the midsection of the HA2 coiled-coil effectively jackknifes the N-terminal FP from the center of the envelope spike out toward the cell membrane. 16, 33, 34 This rearrangement projects the FP into the cell membrane, leading to the extended intermediate. In the envelope glycorproteins of viruses such as alphaviruses and flaviriruses that contain mostly b-sheet structures (the ''class II'' envelope glycoproteins), similar pH effects destabilize the inactive prefusion conformation and promote oligomerization of fusion-active components. 35, 37 In EboV entry, proteolytic disassembly of GP1 by CatL and CatB, whose optimal catalytic activity is known to be at pH $5, is an essential step in early infection events. 10, 11 However, pH-dependent structural transitions have not been reported for GP1 or the GP2 ectodomain.

            "text": "We determined the effect of pH on a-helical bundle stability of Ebo6H and Ebo5H by performing spectroscopic analysis under various buffer conditions. In conditions above pH 6.5, both proteins were poorly behaved and prone to aggregation. However, in range of pH 4.8-6.1, we found that both proteins retained their wellbehaved, native-like properties. We performed thermal denaturation of Ebo6H and Ebo5H under several buffering conditions and found that the T m was lower at higher pH for both proteins (Fig. 4 and Table I ). The folding stability of small, globular proteins can be significantly influenced by pH; however, most proteins are most stably folded at neutral (physiologic) pH and become less stable in conditions below pH 6 (converse to the behavior observed here). 39 The effects of pH on T m were most pronounced in Ebo6H, where the T m differed by 37 C between pH 5.2 (T m \u00bc 86.8 6 2.0 C) and pH 6.1 (T m \u00bc 49.8 6 1.1 C), corresponding to a DDH vH of 7.8 kcal/mol over this range. In addition, heating to 100 C at pH 4.8 did not result in complete unfolding of Ebo6H [ Fig. 3(C) ]. Similar stability effects were observed for Ebo5H although they were less dramatic. The T m values ranged from 82.2 6 1.2 C at pH 4.8 to 72.6 6 1.9 C at pH 6.1; this corresponded to a DDH vH of Table I . 9.6 kcal/mol over this range. Both pIIGP2(552-650), the Wiley construct, and Ebo-95, the longer of the two Kim constructs, had high thermostability at neutral pH or higher. 9, 29 However, the shorter Ebo-74 construct was crystallized and characterized by CD at pH 4.5-4.6. 9 Ebo6H and Ebo5H contain even less of the ectodomain than does Ebo-74, therefore the a-helical stability of shorter constructs may be more sensitive to environmental pH. An examination of the six-helix bundle segment of the GP2 postfusion structure suggests that two side chain-side chain ionic interactions may be responsible for this pH-dependent behavior. On the CHR a-helix, an intrahelical i ! i \u00fe 3 interaction between D621 and D624 could destabilize CHR a-helix formation at neutral pH due to repulsion between the carboxylate anions [ Fig. 5(A) ]. In other short a-helical bundle systems, overall folding stability can be greatly influenced by propensity of individual segments to adopt ahelical fold. 40 Electrostatic i ! i \u00fe 3 interactions can strongly influence a-helix formation and therefore ahelical bundle formation in systems containing segments as short as the GP2 CHR (three a-helical turns). 41, 42 In addition, a repulsive interaction between E564 of the NHR and D629 of the CHR may disrupt interhelical association at neutral pH [ Fig.  5(A) ]. To test this hypothesis, we prepared an Ebo6H variant with the mutations D621N, D624N, and D629N on the CHR segments, and E564Q on the NHR segments (''Ebo6H-QNNN''). As Ebo6H contains a total of three NHR and CHR segments each, the GP2 NHR/CHR segments of Ebo6H-QNNN have 12 total substitutions relative to the analogous segments in Ebo6H. We found Ebo6H-QNNN to be a-helical by CD; thermal denaturation indicates that the T m s were similar at pH 4.8 and 5.3 [43.1 6 0.9 C and 46.2 6 1.0 C, respectively, Fig. 5(B) ] but was lower than Ebo6H under these conditions. Furthermore, unfolding transition for Ebo6H-QNNN was much broader that of Ebo6H. These differences may reflect the fact that aspargine has lower a-helical propensity in coiled-coil proteins than does aspartic acid and therefore the nine Asp ! Asn substitutions in the GP2 NHR/CHR regions have a cumulative effect on folding stability. 40 Ebo6H-QNNN had higher stability at pH 6.1 (T m \u00bc 53.5 6 1.1 C) than at the lower pHs. This behavior contrasts with that of Ebo6H, which was significantly more stable under acidic conditions than at pH 6.1. Furthermore, Ebo6H-QNNN had 3.7 C higher T m than did Ebo6H at pH 6.1, indicating that the ahelical fold of Ebo6H-QNNN is less sensitive to conditions near neutral pH. In addition, Ebo6H was much less stable than Ebo5H at pH 6.1 (T m s of 49.8 6 1.1 C for Ebo6H and 72.6 6 1.9 C for Ebo5H) suggesting that repulsive interactions within the additional CHR segment in Ebo6H substantially affects global a-helical bundle fold stability under these conditions. Taken together, these results suggest that anionic side chain-side chain interactions mediate pH-dependent a-helical bundle stability in Ebo6H.",

As the pKa of the imidazole side chain is approximately 6, it is possible that the histidine tags contribute to the pHsensitive behavior observed here. Unfortunately, attempts to isolate Ebo6H variants containing fewer than two histidine tags were unsuccessful and therefore we could not directly compare thermostability with and without these segments. However, increased cationic charge density by protonation of histidine tags at the N-and C-terminal ends is predicted to disfavor folding due to repulsion between the N-and Cterminal ends in a compact, globular state. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the histidine tags play a role in the pH-dependent stability of Ebo6H and Ebo5H, it seems unlikely that the observed effects could be explained by these regions alone. Although the pH range in which we see the most dramatic changes in Ebo6H and Ebo5H structural stability (pH 4.8-6.1) falls above the pKa of carboxylic acid side chains (pH $4), it is not unusual for side chain pKas to be elevated in situations where their deprotonation disfavors formation of a highly stable fold. [43] [44] [45] [46] Such phenomena have been documented in other a-helical bundle proteins as well. [43] [44] [45] [46] Conclusions and implications for membrane fusion Our analysis with Ebo6H and Ebo5H provide new insight into folding and stability for the six-helix bundle of EboV GP2. We found that Ebo6H, a designed protein mimic of the GP2 a-helical bundle, adopts a highly thermostable fold. Among class I viral membrane fusion glycoproteins, the central ectodomain core NHR trimeric coiled-coil of EboV GP2 and analogous proteins from the structurally related MarV, MoMLV HTLV-1, and ASLV are relatively short in length. 1, 2, 14 The core NHR trimers of influenza A virus HA2 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus S2 are longer than EboV GP2, but these ectodomains also contain loop or non-a-helical segments and therefore their six-helix bundle segments are also small in comparison to HIV-1 gp41. 3 Our studies demonstrate that even the small a-helical bundle of EboV GP2 (consisting of a-helical segments containing just three to four turns) provides a large amount of energy to overcome barriers associated with membrane fusion. Furthermore, we found that Ebo5H was less stable than Ebo6H (DT m \u00bc 6.2 C at pH 5.3) thereby demonstrating that a single CHR segment can enhance thermostability of the a-helical bundle by a significant amount. Similar designed 5-Helix proteins based on HIV-1 gp41 act as potent inhibitors of entry by sequestering the CHR segment on the extended intermediate during infection. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] We tested Ebo5H for entry inhibition using a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus containing the EboV GP in place of the native envelope glycoprotein (VSV-GP). We found that Ebo5H was not able to inhibit infection of VSV-GP (Miller and Chandran, unpublished results) , although this result is likely because the extended intermediate is exposed only in the endosome. 7 We recently reported that antiviral activity of peptides corresponding to the GP2 CHR segment (C-peptides) can be enhanced by inclusion of an endosome-targeting sequence. 25 Further studies indicated that the folding stabilities of Ebo6H and Ebo5H were pH sensitive. The ahelical bundle stability as judged by T m and DH vH values was significantly lower in buffering conditions closer to neutral pH than in acidic conditions. Analysis with Ebo6H-QNNN suggested that anionic side chain-side chain interactions mediate this pHdependent stability in Ebo6H; this feature of the GP2 six-helix bundle may have implications in control of the fusion reaction. In the prevailing model for viral membrane fusion, it is thought that the transmembrane subunit is prevented from adopting the thermodynamically stable a-helical bundle structure by interactions with the surface subunit in the prefusion conformation. 47, 48 Triggering events cause dissociation of the surface subunit and releases constraints on the transmembrane subunit ectodomain, allowing the eventual formation of the a-helical bundle that drives membrane fusion (the ''spring loaded clamp'' model). In HIV-1 and influenza A virus, the events that trigger release of the transmembrane subunits (gp41 and HA2) from the prefusion confor-mation are well established. For HIV-1, where membrane fusion is thought to occur at the cellular surface, a conformational change in gp120 on CD4 and coreceptor binding induces its dissociation from the spike. 49 In influenza A virus, which enters via the endosome, low pH destabilizes the prefusion conformation and leads to the extended intermediate.",

Comparison of the NHR and CHR segments in the prefusion GP1-GP2 assembly demonstrates that the protein segment corresponding to the long a-helical NHR coiled-coil is interrupted into three shorter a-helices in the prefusion structure. 7, 12 Electron density for the CHR segments was not observed in the prefusion structure, suggesting that this region is dynamic. 12 Recent mutational studies on the helix-turn-helix/loop segment of the ASLV transmembrane envelope glycoprotein (EnvA) have implicated a histidine residue in the pH dependence of EnvA-mediated viral entry. 14 Mutation of residues in the analogous segment in EboV GP2 have an effect on viral entry but, in the absence of a fusion assay directed at the cell surface, it is not possible to determine whether these residues are involved in pH-dependent structural changes that promote membrane fusion. 14 Furthermore, a recent report suggests that the fusion loop of GP2 also undergoes a conformational transition between pH 7 and 5.5 that activates fusogenic activity under the lower pH condition. 38 The results presented here suggest that pH-dependent ahelical bundle stability could also play a role in controlling the timing of membrane fusion. At neutral pH, the six-helix bundle is less stable and therefore the prefusion conformation is preferred. However, once the virus particle is taken up into an endosome that undergoes acidification, the postfusion six-helix bundle becomes more stable and therefore the postfusion state becomes preferred. The pH range in which we see the most significant changes in stability (pH 4.8-6.1) corresponds to the pH of late endosomes and correlates closely with the optimal pH for acid-dependent cysteine cathepsin activity. This proposed mechanism for conformational control is distinct from that of other endosomal viruses: in most cases, the pH change destabilizes the prefusion conformation rather than stabilizing the postfusion conformation. [1] [2] [3] [4] Further studies will be required to determine if this pH-dependent stability is relevant in the virus and whether other pH-induced structural changes occur.",
