            "text": "Objectives The objectives were to collect baseline data on the occurrence, testing and vaccination practices, and clinical outcomes of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in New Zealand Methods A cross-sectional survey of 423 veterinary practices in New Zealand was performed to collect data on FeLV and FIV testing and vaccination during the 2015 calendar year. Clinical records from 572 cats tested using a point-of-care ELISA at a first-opinion veterinary practice between 7 April 2010 and 23 June 2016 were also obtained and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to identify risk factors for test positivity. Survival times were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Results The survey was completed by 112 clinics (26.4%) of which 72 performed in-house testing. Of the 2125 tests performed, 56 (2.6%) were positive for FeLV and 393 (18.5%) were positive for FIV. Fewer than 1% of cats were vaccinated for FeLV, with veterinarians citing low perceived prevalence as the primary reason for not vaccinating. Being male compared with being female and having clinical evidence of immunosuppression were significant risk factors for both FeLV and FIV test positivity. The median survival times of FeLV and FIV test-positive cats were 10 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 0-16) and 650 days (95% CI 431-993), respectively. Conclusions and relevance Testing and vaccination for FeLV and FIV in New Zealand appears targeted towards high-risk animals, which may bias prevalence estimates. Baseline data should be monitored for changes in FeLV epidemiology now commercial vaccines are no longer available.",

            "text": "Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) are important pathogens causing clinical disease in domestic cats worldwide. 1 The prevalences reported in the literature vary widely depending on the geographical location and clinical characteristics of the study populations, 2 with infections less commonly reported in healthy cats and confined cats compared with clinically unwell cats and free-roaming cats. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Both viruses spread directly through bite wounds. 3, 9, 10 Sexual contact, vertical transmission and social interactions such as mutual grooming or shared food or water dishes are more important transmission pathways for FeLV than FIV. 11, 12 Unsurprisingly, cats that are aggressive, sexually intact, frequently in contact with other cats or observed fighting have been identified as being significantly more likely to test positive for either pathogen. 8, [13] [14] [15] Experimental studies have shown that susceptibility to FeLV decreases significantly with age, with almost 100% of newborn kittens developing persistent viraemia after inoculation vs only 15% of kittens over 4 months of age. 16, 17 Since there are currently no effective treatments for FeLV and FIV, 18 the cornerstone of disease management in clinical practice is preventing new infections through vaccination or segregation. 19 Many cats diagnosed with FeLV die or are euthanased within 2-3 years owing to clinical complications, 20 while FIV-positive cats can remain asymptomatic for many years. 21, 22 Diagnostic testing is therefore important for determining the infection status of cats to inform clinical decisions, 23 but may not be performed routinely in private practice. 24 FeLV and FIV are both endemic in the New Zealand domestic cat population, yet relatively little is known about their epidemiology. Two studies published in the early 1980s reported the prevalence of FeLV in cattery populations at between 4.4% and 11%, 25, 26 while another more recent study from 2013 estimated the national prevalences of FeLV and FIV at 5.5% and 10%, respectively, based on 200 blood samples submitted to a commercial diagnostic laboratory for routine haematological testing. 27 There has also been some recent work to characterise the molecular epidemiology of FIV in New Zealand to determine whether the commercially available vaccine is likely to be effective against the currently circulating subtypes. 28, 29 However, since vaccination against FIV is relatively uncommon in New Zealand, 30 and the last commercially available vaccine for FeLV was removed from the domestic market in March 2016 owing to low sale volumes, these tools are not currently being utilised to protect patient populations. Gathering better baseline data on disease occurrence, risk factors and clinical outcomes will be important for guiding discussions on how we can better manage these diseases moving forward.",

These results were markedly different from the 5.5% FeLV prevalence and 10% FIV prevalence reported in the previous cross-sectional study of random blood samples submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in New Zealand 27 but broadly consistent with estimates from Australia, which were obtained from demographically similar populations. 13, 32 There are several possible reasons for our higher observed occurrence of FIV. First, veterinarians who responded to our survey indicated that the majority of cats were only tested because there was a high index of suspicion for disease, such as the presence of compatible clinical signs, known exposure to infected animals and presentation for bite wounds. These have previously been identified as risk factors for FIV, 2,8,13 and we would therefore expect a higher occurrence of disease in this population compared with cats selected at random. Even though most cats were not retested for confirmation, previous research has demonstrated a good correlation between the presence of FIV antibodies on ELISA and the presence of proviral DNA on blood PCR, which is indicative of active infection. 33 Second, false-positive reactions can occur on the FIV antibody tests used in practice owing to previous FIV vaccination or the presence of maternal antibodies. [34] [35] [36] Although it is unlikely that veterinarians would have tested a known vaccinated cat, many patients present with an incomplete medical history and it is therefore possible that some of the tested cats were previously vaccinated. Third, in the free-text comments of our survey, several veterinarians indicated that they had stopped testing for FIV and FeLV in-house because clinical cases were rare in their practice regions. The study sample may therefore have been biased towards practices with higher clinical disease occurrence.",

            "text": "In guidelines published by the American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP), it was recommended that all cats be routinely screened for FeLV and FIV when they are first acquired, when they have compatible clinical signs and when they have high-risk lifestyles, which include known exposures to infected cats, evidence of bite wounds and access to the outdoors. 19 Previous research has documented that the majority of clientowned cats in New Zealand are free-roaming, 37 and at least 36% of cats from our first-opinion practice data had a known history of medical treatment for cat bite wounds, which would place them in the high-risk category. However, <2% of client-owned cats across New Zealand were tested for FeLV and FIV over a single calendar year. Similar low levels of compliance with testing guidelines have been reported in the USA, even when testing was offered at no cost to the client. 24 In the freetext comments of the national clinic survey, one veterinarian indicated that routine testing was not performed because a positive diagnosis was unlikely to change the management or clinical outcome for the patient, particularly since many clients were reluctant to confine their cats. To our knowledge, there has been little research to date in the field of FeLV and FIV epidemiology exploring client perceptions and responses to positive diagnoses. This could have significant implications on our ability to control these viruses at the population level and therefore warrants further investigation. Cats that tested positive for FeLV and/or FIV on the in-house ELISA frequently presented with lethargy, anorexia, weight loss and immunosuppression, which may have indicated that their retroviral diseases had progressed to an advanced clinical stage. Given that relatively few cats were retested for confirmation, we cannot rule out the possibility that these clinical signs were associated with other underlying disease processes. However, we speculate within the limitations of reviewing historical medical records that many of these cats would have been euthansed anyway, regardless of confirmation, owing to the poor clinical prognosis. This likely explains why the survival times for positive cats were significantly lower in our study compared with the [20] [21] [22] 38 Other factors that may contribute to lower survival times could include coinfection with both FIV and FeLV, 39 or other opportunistic pathogens, 40, 41 as well as differences in the potential virulence of common circulating strains in New Zealand compared with other countries. 42 The preliminary investigation into risk factors for FeLV and FIV found no evidence that previous bite wounds, known exposure to infected cats or being sexually intact increased the risk of test positivity, despite these being identified in other studies as important risk factors. 9,10,12 While we cannot rule out biases due to missing information in historical medical records or biases due to data only being obtained from a single practice, it is also possible that transmission dynamics in New Zealand are different from other populations owing to the majority of cats being free-roaming. For example, FeLV is traditionally considered a pathogen that requires prolonged close friendly contact like mutual grooming or shared water for transmission given the poor survivability of the virus in the environment. 43, 44 Housemates that are indoor-outdoor may have fewer close contacts. Similar to other studies from the USA, 8 Australia 32 and Germany, 2 we found that being male significantly increased the risk of FeLV and FIV test positivity. From a behavioural perspective, male cats have been shown to have more aggressive tendencies, leading to a greater risk of bite wounds. 24, 45 The majority of cats in our study were also already neutered, which may explain why this was not found to be a significant risk factor.",

Although vaccination rates were still low prior to March 2016 when the vaccine was removed, 30 our study found that FeLV vaccines were primarily administered to high-risk cats. It will be important to monitor how the epidemiology of the disease changes now that these cats can no longer be protected. Several practices declined to participate in the national survey because they were unable to easily query their practice data to obtain summary data on the number of feline patients and results from the diagnostic testing. New initiatives are currently underway in New Zealand to improve data capture from electronic medical records that will hopefully make these type of monitoring studies easier in the future. 46, 47 ",

Of the 112 respondents, 72 (64.3%) performed point-of-care FeLV and FIV tests in their practice during the 2015 calendar year with 51 (70.8%) using the IDEXX SNAP FIV/ FeLV Combo Test, 10 (13.9%) using the InSight FIV-FeLV Combi Rapid Diagnostic Test (Woodley Equipment), six (8.3%) using the FASTest FeLV-FIV test (Megacor Diagnostik) and five (6.9%) using the SensPERT FeLV Ag/FIV Ab Test (VetAll Laboratories). An estimated 2125 in-house tests were performed in a patient population of approximately 120,000 cats, meaning that <2% of cats were tested annually. The overall prevalence of FIV-positive tests was 18.5%, whereas the overall prevalence of FeLV-positive tests was 2.6%. Most veterinary practices (67.3%) used the test to check for FIV only rather than to screen for both diseases (31.2%) or to screen for FeLV only (1.6%). The primary reason for running the in-house test was because the patient was showing compatible clinical signs (60.2% for FIV and 71.4% for FeLV). A smaller percentage of tests were run for routine screening (22.7% for FIV and 24.1%",
