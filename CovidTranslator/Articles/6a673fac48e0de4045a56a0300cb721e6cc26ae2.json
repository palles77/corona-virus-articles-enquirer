The fear of infection or new, unknown tasks in an unfamiliar setting, for example, may complicate outbreak management. Aim: To gain insight into how healthcare organizations can prepare to meet the needs of their HCWs by capturing the experiences of HCWs with patients with suspected Ebola virus disease. Methods: We conducted 23 in-depth interviews with HCWs, of whom 20 worked in a Dutch university hospital and three worked in a regional ambulance service. We invited HCWs who cared for patients with suspected Ebola or who were on the team preparing for admission of such patients in the period 2014e2015. Findings: The HCWs were stressed and anxious, but most rated their overall experience as positive. We categorized the reported experiences in three main themes, namely, experiences related to: (i) the novelty of the threat, (ii) the risk of infection and fear of transmission, and (iii) the excessive attention. Our results underline the importance of a supportive working environment suitable for crises. Conclusion: The experiences of HCWs dealing with patients with suspected Ebola can direct improvements in generic preparedness for highly transmissible diseases.",

They may have to work extra shifts and perform tasks that do not belong to their daily routine in a different department, and they may have to work in a multidisciplinary team they are not accustomed to [2] . They must also deal with the unpredictability of their working schedule, which requires them to adjust their private and social life [3] . Most importantly, HCWs are at risk of exposure to highly infectious pathogens while they care for the patients. This may cause fear of being infected or being a source of infection for close contacts such as family members [2e4] . Such stressful events may have negative effects. For example, HCWs exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome or Marburg haemorrhagic fever experienced high levels of psychological distress as a result of temperature monitoring and reporting, and of quarantine [4, 5] . The consequences of distress may persist long after the outbreak and may result in depression or post-traumatic stress disorder [2,6e10] .",

On the basis of the reported experiences, we constructed a framework for preparedness that included crisis-specific themes.

When preparing for outbreaks, healthcare organizations focus mainly on the medical, hygienic, and organizational aspects, whereas the human factors are ignored [14] .

            "text": "One must bear in mind that in this study we interviewed professionals who worked in a well-organized and wellprepared healthcare system while caring for patients potentially infected by a highly contagious disease. Even in this well-controlled and relatively safe situation, we found many aspects that affect HCWs. The impact on HCWs working in less well-organized or less prepared organizations will likely be different. Healthcare organizations should plan and put mechanisms in place to capture the experiences of HCWs and channel them in order to improve the resilience of the HCWs, and, if need be, their families. There are many studies and guidelines that describe mental care in other contexts of major emergency situations, mass trauma events, or disasters [11, 15, 16] . In line with our findings, these documents acknowledge the importance of creating feelings of safety and connectedness, providing reliable information, and showing organizational involvement and facilitation of the exchange of experiences between those involved. However, they lack recommendations about the risk of infection and excessive attention that may arise during outbreaks. The results of these studies and guidelines are, however, difficult to translate to HCWs dealing with highly infectious patients for three reasons. First, most of the literature describes care for victims or patients but not for HCWs who are exposed to the pathogen because of their obligation to attend work [11,16e18] . Second, infectious disease outbreaks have a unique feature among mass trauma events: transferability of pathogens from person to person that may result in fear of containment. Third, an outbreak is not a sudden disaster; the severity may gradually increase, and infectious disease outbreaks may eventually last for months. This means that HCWs must work in a stressful environment for a long period. One other study took a step to gain insight into the experiences of HCWs regarding their mental state when they were working during the Ebola outbreak in a western country [19] . The reported experiences are similar to our findings. Our study, in addition, provides a systematic framework that may be helpful to healthcare organizations when they are preparing for outbreaks. The experiences related to the factor 'working environment' apply to all outbreaks, irrespective of whether they are new or highly infectious, or whether they create excessive attention. Healthcare organizations should first focus on these experiences when they begin preparing for outbreaks. 'Yes, you are just doing your job and the first time with the first patient and the first moments in the isolation room .. If there are a lot of people nearby, you think: just let us do our jobs. Because when you get out of the isolation room you are sweating like crazy and just want to recover.'",

This study can nevertheless be used as a basis for further research into this topic and gives enough items and opportunities for improving preparedness in the industrialized western world. Because we identified experiences, and not necessarily needs or shortcomings of healthcare organizations, it is difficult to provide extensive advice for healthcare organizations. One of the strengths of this study is the data synthesis. We used an iterative group process that led to the identification of patterns and themes across our data. Another strength is the diversity of the HCWs who participated in the interviews.
