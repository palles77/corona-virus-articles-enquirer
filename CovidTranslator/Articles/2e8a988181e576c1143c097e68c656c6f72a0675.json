However, the prevalence of subtler forms of neurocognitive dysfunction, which together with HAD are termed HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), continues to escalate in the post-cART era. The microgliosis, astrogliosis, dendritic damage, and synaptic and neuronal loss observed in autopsy cases suggest an underlying neuroinflammatory process, due to the neurotoxic factors released by HIV-infected/activated macrophages/ microglia in the brain, might underlie the pathogenesis of HAND in the post-cART era. These factors are known to induce the integrated stress response (ISR) in several neurodegenerative diseases; we have previously shown that BiP, an indicator of general ISR activation, is upregulated in cortical autopsy tissue from HIV-infected patients. The ISR is composed of three pathways, each with its own initiator protein: PERK, IRE1\u03b1 and ATF6.",

The neuroinflammation in HAND can be tracked to HIV-infected monocytes that differentiate into macrophages in the brain parenchyma after crossing the blood-brain barrier [8] . These infected macrophages constitute the viral reservoir in the brain; moreover, these infected macrophages are thought to lead to infection and/or activation of resident central nervous system (CNS) macrophages and microglia. While extensive studies have linked neuronal damage and death to the clinical presentation of HAND, neurones themselves lack the necessary co-receptors for HIV binding and entry and are therefore not directly infected by the virus [9] . Rather, infected and/or activated macrophages, astrocytes and neurones release a wide range of soluble neurotoxic factors, including viral proteins, cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species, and excitotoxins, into the extracellular milieu as part of the inflammatory response.",

            "text": "Several studies have shown that some of the soluble factors that are released as part of the HIV-induced inflammatory response, as well as HIV viral proteins themselves, are able to induce the integrated stress response (ISR) [endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, unfolded protein response], suggesting that the ISR may play a role in HAND [10] . The ISR orchestrates a multitude of cellular responses against a wide range of extra-and intracellular stresses by regulating intracellular Ca 2+ levels; ER chaperone genes; protein synthesis, folding and degradation; and the endogenous antioxidant response [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . A variety of insults can trigger the ISR, such as oxidative stress, hypoxia, toxins, nutrient deprivation and viral infection. In fact, many types of viruses actively regulate the ISR in their host cells, showing a great variety in the manners and mechanisms by which they do so, preventing components of ISR activity harmful to virus survival and replication and exploiting ISR components beneficial to the virus, and even showing cell-type specificity [15, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Further, a role for the ISR has been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease, as well as in CNS injury, such as brain trauma and ischaemia [13, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Importantly, while the primary purpose of the ISR is to promote cellular survival in the short term, chronic ISR activation in response to sustained injury/ insult or in cases of extreme insult can also lead to orchestrated cell death [15, 36, 38, 41, 42] . Thus, chronic ISR activation may provide a link between the inflammatory response to HIV infection in the CNS and neuronal dysfunction, damage and death in HAND.",

All three initiator proteins are ER transmembrane proteins and each is maintained in its inactive state by interaction of its luminal domain with the ER resident chaperone protein, BiP/GRP78 (immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein/glucose-regulated protein 78) , often considered to be the master regulator of the ISR [42] .

            "text": "Each initiator protein activates its path of the ISR via a distinct mechanism, allowing for a coordinated and well controlled three-pronged cellular stress response [10] . ATF6 is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that when freed from BiP translocates to the Golgi where it is cleaved into its active form, which then moves into the nucleus [43] [44] [45] [46] . Once in the nucleus, it binds the ER stress response element (ERSE) found in the upstream region of genes encoding proteins important for responding to the offending stresses, such as ER chaperone proteins and folding catalysts [47] . PERK and IRE1\u03b1 are both kinases that, when released from BiP, homodimerize and activate via autophosphorylation [10] . PERK then activates of its branch of the ISR by phosphorylating the \u03b1-subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1), causing a global inhibition of translation initiation, while simultaneously promoting the translation of certain stress response proteins, including activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) [17] . Like its family member, ATF6, ATF4 is a bZIP transcription factor that binds the ERSE, thereby transactivating stress response genes [48] . Interestingly, eIF2\u03b1 can be activated by other kinases in a stress-specific manner: general control non-depressible-2 (GCN2), which senses amino acid starvation; the protein activated by dsRNA (PKR), which is important for the cellular response to viral infection; and haem-regulated inhibitor, which senses haem deficiency in erythroid cells [49] . Autophosphorylation of the initiator protein IRE1\u03b1 activates its endoribonuclease domains allowing it to cleave the mRNA of its one known target, X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). Once cleaved to its mature form, XBP1 mRNA encodes yet another bZIP transcription factor capable of binding the ERSE [50, 51] .",

            "text": "While the three ISR pathways function via distinct mechanisms, they are all capable of activating the transcription of genes with the ERSE in their promoter regions, including the master regulator of the ISR, BiP, as well as others, such as CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) [18] . This means that BiP is not only a critical overseer of the ISR, but also a key indicator of activity of any of the three ISR pathways. In a previous report, we showed that BiP is increased in the grey matter of mid-frontal cortex of patients with HIV infection and with HIV-induced neurocognitive impairment, indicating that the ISR is indeed activated in the CNS of these individuals [52] . However, as BiP can be upregulated by all branches of the ISR [18] , our previous study did not determine which of the three pathways may be responding in this disease. It is important to note that, while BiP is implicated in the regulation of all three ISR pathways, the pathways do not necessarily exhibit concomitant, coordinated activation [53] [54] [55] , allowing a more precise functionality of the ISR than an all-or-nothing response. This phenomenon is especially likely to occur during viral infection, as many viruses exploit specific ISR pathways, while inhibiting others, to enable persistence/latency [28, 30, 31, 33, [56] [57] [58] . Thus, in the study presented here, we sought to more specifically characterize the activation of the ISR in the CNS of HIV-infected patients. Specifically, we used immunofluorescence (IFA) and immunoblotting to examine the levels of key players in the three prongs of the ISR in the grey matter of mid-frontal cortical autopsy tissue from HAND cases. Here we report that ATF6\u03b2 is increased in neurones and astrocytes in HIV(+) tissue and in HAND tissue over HIV(\u2212) and neurocognitively normal control tissue, respectively. We also show via immunoblotting that total ATF6\u03b1, another isoform of ATF6, increases in HAND tissue. On the contrary, via immunoblotting, we saw no significant change in IRE1\u03b1 across experimental groups, and that, if anything it showed a trend of decreasing in HIV(+) cases. Finally, in the PERK pathway of the ISR, we found that peIF2\u03b1 increases in HIV(+) cases when compared with HIV(\u2212) cases. Interestingly, although ATF4 increases in the cytoplasm of astrocytes in HAND cases over neurocognitively normal controls, total ATF4 as observed by IFA actually decreases. To expand our examination of the ISR further, we also examined two more ISR gene targets, CHOP and HSP70, via immunoblotting. Neither target changed significantly with either HIV infection or neurocognitive status, although CHOP showed a trend of decreasing in HIV(+) cases. Lastly, because of the significant increase in astrocytic BiP that we had observed previously [52] , we determined the astrocytic nuclear levels of ATF6\u03b2 and ATF4, which as transcription factors need to translocate to the nucleus to transactivate BiP. We found that ATF6\u03b2 increases in the nucleus of astrocytes in both HAND and HIV(+) tissue with respect to control tissue. While nuclear astrocytic ATF4 does not change, total ATF4 colocalized with DAPI, which is predominantly neuronal nuclear ATF4, actually decreases in HAND cases. These findings (summarized in Table 1 and Figures 11 and 12 ) suggest that the increase in astrocytic BiP that we reported previously is more likely due to the ATF6 branch of the ISR than to the IRE1\u03b1 or the PERK branches. Moreover, the data presented here demonstrate that the ISR activation that occurs in HAND and in HIV(+) tissue varies across cell types and is due to selective activation of the certain components of the ISR. Thus, further studies to uncover the nuances of ISR activation in this disease will be important to the development of potential therapies.",

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to phosphorylated PERK (pPERK) (Thr980, 1:1000; Cell Signalling Inc., Beverly, MA, USA), peIF2\u03b1 (pS52, 1:1000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), ATF4 (C-20, 1:600; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Z0334, 1:80; Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA), goat polyclonal antibody raised against ATF6\u03b2 (N-17, 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mouse monoclonal antibody to microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) (SMI-52, 1:200; Covance Research Products, Berkeley, CA, USA) were used at empirically defined dilutions. Antibodies are summarized in Table 4 . The tyramide amplification system (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) was used to detect the markers of ISR. To visualize staining, slides were incubated for 30 min with goat secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA) except for ATF6\u03b2, where a donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was utilized. The primary antibodies for ISR markers were detected by biotin-conjugated, secondary antibodies (1:200) for use with the tyramide amplification system, and were subsequently visualized using Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated Streptavidin (New England Biolabs). The GFAP and MAP2 primary antibodies were visualized by a Cy-5-conjugated, goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:200) and a Cy-3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:200), respectively, and DAPI was used to visualize DNA (5 mM, Invitrogen).

First, we examined the ATF6 pathway via quadruple-label immunofluorescent confocal microscopy (IFA) for ATF6\u03b2 protein levels.

In the current study, we found that total levels of ATF6\u03b2 increase in the mid-frontal cortex of HAND autopsy cases compared with levels in neurocognitively normal cases ( Figure 1A , B; summarized in Table 1 , Figures 11 and 12 ).",

These findings parallel our immunoblot data presented previously [52] . Next, we examined cell typespecific changes in ATF6\u03b2 expression by quantifying its colocalization with cell-type markers, MAP2 and GFAP, which mark the cytoplasm of neurones and astrocytes, respectively. Importantly, protein levels of these two markers frequently change in HAND patients due to the reactive astrocytosis (increased GFAP) and neuronal damage and loss (MAP2 loss) associated with this disease [5, 7, [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] . Thus, to ensure that any changes in cell type-specific ATF6\u03b2 levels were not due to an increase or decrease in the amount of the phenotypic marker present, we normalized colocalization values to total area of the phenotypic marker. Using this methodology, we found that ATF6\u03b2 is increased in the cytoplasm of both neurones and astrocytes in HAND cases and in HIV(+) cases as compared with that in neurocognitively normal and HIV(\u2212) cases, respectively (Figure 2A-D) . As a transcription factor, ATF6\u03b2 must move into the nucleus to perform its function in cellular stress mitigation. We found that ATF6\u03b2 was predominantly cytoplasmic in our staining, regardless of disease state; however, particularly in astrocytes, we did observe some nuclear staining, observed as colocalization with the nucleic acid marker, DAPI. Our initial analysis showed that total nuclear ATF6\u03b2 did not change significantly ( Figure 2E , F). Because we had previously seen an increase in BiP protein levels that reached significance in astrocytes, but not in neurones [52] , we sought to determine whether ATF6\u03b2 might be increasing in the nuclei of astrocytes specifically, and is therefore able to transactivate BiP expressly in this cell type. As we have been unable to find a cell type-specific nuclear marker that works for IFA, we had to manually determine astrocytic nuclei (see methods for details), a feasible task due to the relatively small number of astrocytes in each image. Our analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in astrocytic nuclear ATF6\u03b2 in HAND cases as compared with neurocognitively normal cases, which was also true for HIV(+) cases when compared with HIV(\u2212) cases ( Figures 1A and 2G , H). Unfortunately, the overwhelmingly large number of neurones in our confocal images prohibited us from performing similar analysis to specifically quantify neuronal nuclear ATF6\u03b2. However, given that astrocytes comprise only a small percentage of cells captured in each image, it is likely that quantification of total nuclear ATF6\u03b2 is indicative of neuronal nuclear ATF6\u03b2. Of note, while we detected the vast majority of ATF6\u03b2 staining in either MAP2-or GFAP-positive cells, we did observe small amounts of nuclear ATF6\u03b2 staining in cells that were neither MAP2-nor GFAP-positive.",

Further, the currently available XBP1 antibodies are not reliable for our assays. However, the E5 transforming protein of the high-risk human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) has been shown to not only downregulate levels of XBP1 mRNA, but also downregulate IRE1\u03b1 itself [24] . Thus, we were interested in whether a similar phenomenon might be occurring in cells from the cortex of HIV(+) individuals. Thus, via immunoblotting we examined levels of IRE1\u03b1 in mid-frontal cortical autopsy tissue from HIV(+) and HAND cases.

Because there is no reliable antibody for pPERK, we conducted IFA and immunoblotting for peIF2\u03b1, as a downstream target of pPERK, to examine the activation of this branch of the ISR. We found that peIF2\u03b1 increased in HIV(+) cases over HIV(\u2212) cases, as observed by both IFA (Figure 5A , C) and immunoblotting ( Figure 6A , C). Via immunoblotting, we also examined levels of unphosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 ( Figure 6 ), which when quantified showed no significant change across groups (data not shown). For quantification of peIF2\u03b1 via immunoblotting, we determined values for peIF2\u03b1/ total eIF2\u03b1 per sample ( Figure 6B -D). We found that peIF2\u03b1 increased in HIV(+) over HIV(\u2212) tissue, but not in HAND tissue over neurocognitively normal tissue ( Figure 6B -D). We observed similar trends via IFA. However, in addition to the significant increase in peIF2\u03b1 in HIV(+) tissue compared with HIV(\u2212) tissue, via IFA we also observed a significant increase of peIF2\u03b1 in HAND cases compared with neurocognitively normal cases ( Figure 5A -C), although this change was so small that it is questionable as to whether it is a meaningful change. Further, in our IFA study of peIF2\u03b1 we had access to a larger cohort of cases than for the other IFA studies presented here. Thus, we were able to conduct one-way anova between all three experimental groups. We observed a significant increase in the HIV(+) groups, both neurocognitively normal and HAND, when compared with HIV(\u2212)/neurocognitively normal controls ( Figure 5D ). When we examined peIF2\u03b1 colocalized with MAP2 using IFA, we found that this neuronal peIF2\u03b1 increased in HAND and in HIV(+) tissue over respective control groups ( Figure 5E , F). As with total peIF2\u03b1, neuronal peIF2\u03b1 increases were more striking in HIV(+) tissue than they were in HAND tissue, and when the three experimental groups were compared using one-way anova, both HIV(+) groups (neurocognitively normal and HAND) showed increased peIF2\u03b1 compared with HIV(\u2212) neurocognitively normal cases ( Figure 5G ). These data suggest that increased peIF2\u03b1 in mid-frontal cortex is associated with HIV infection, rather than with HIV-associated neurocognitive decline. Nuclear peIF2\u03b1 was not determined because, as a post-translational regulator, it is not expected to localize to the nucleus. Of note, we detected peIF2\u03b1 staining exclusively in MAP2-or GFAP-positive cells; however, unfortunately, GFAP staining was not of a quality and consistency to allow for quantification of colocalization using this marker. The cohort of tissue cases used for IFA of peIF2\u03b1 was different from that used for the other ISR proteins examined in this study and was supplied by different tissue banks. Thus, it is probable that some aspect of tissue processing differed between these brain banks that affected the staining of this marker.",

Interestingly, via IFA we found that total levels of ATF4 decreased in HAND cases as compared with neurocognitively normal cases ( Figure 7A , B). ATF4 staining was both nuclear and cytoplasmic and when we examined ATF4 that colocalized with DAPI we found that, like total ATF4 levels, nuclear ATF4 also decreased in HAND cases ( Figure 8E ). However, we saw no change in total ATF4 ( Figure 7C ) or total nuclear ATF4 levels ( Figure  8F ) in HIV(+) cases compared with those seen in HIV(\u2212) cases. Interestingly, when we examined cell type-specific levels of cytoplasmic ATF4, we found that, while neuronal cytoplasmic ATF4 levels show no changes with either neurocognitive status or HIV status ( Figure 8A , B), astrocytic cytoplasmic ATF4 actually increased in HAND cases over neurocognitively normal cases and in HIV(+) cases over HIV(\u2212) cases ( Figure 8C, D) .",

In this paper, we explore the nature of ISR activation in this disease, as we had previously reported an increase of BiP, an indicator of ISR activation, in the CNS of HIV(+) patients. While the ISR is largely a protective response, it can also culminate in a pro-apoptotic response under certain conditions, and thus our observations of ISR activation in HAND required further investigation to determine whether the ISR ultimately provides protection or causes neuronal death or perhaps a combination of both in this disease. The findings presented here and summarized in Figures 11 and 12 and in Table 2 demonstrate the nuanced nature of the ISR, showing that it is not an all-or-nothing response and that it can vary across cell types.",

This finding is in agreement with studies suggesting that ATF6 is upregulated at the transcriptional level by ISR activation in a positive feedback mechanism [68, 69] . Here we continued our examination of the ATF6\u03b2 response in HIV(+) cortical tissue using IFA. We first confirmed our previous data, showing via IFA that total ATF6\u03b2 increases in both HAND and HIV(+) cases when compared with neurocognitively normal and HIV(\u2212) cases, respectively. Importantly, IFA allows examination of protein levels as they vary across subcellular compartments and across different cell types. ATF6 is a transcription factor that has two forms, ATF6\u03b1 and ATF6\u03b2, that are both activated under stress conditions by translocation to the Golgi, followed by proteolytic cleavage, which allows its active, cleaved form to translocate to the nucleus and induce expression of target genes [65] [66] [67] . Manifestly, only nuclear ATF6 is able to perform its transcriptional function. In this report, we found that total nuclear ATF6\u03b2 did not change in HAND or HIV(+) cases compared with controls, although astrocytic nuclear ATF6\u03b2 did increase significantly in both HAND and HIV(+) tissue, suggesting that activation of ATF6\u03b2 may be an important contributor to the increased BiP protein that we had previously observed in astrocytes in HIV(+) tissue. However, despite our findings in astrocytes, it is interesting to note that the majority of the total ATF6\u03b2 staining was clearly non-nuclear. These findings likely suggest that even though ATF6\u03b2 is increased in HAND, it may not be efficiently moving into the nucleus to activate its target genes, particularly in neurones, although one must consider the caveat that some nuclear ATF6\u03b2 may not be observable by IFA due to protein complexes formed during its nuclear activities.",

This inhibition did not, however, inhibit ATF6 translocation to the Golgi [70] . Another study identified nucleobindin 1 as an endogenous inhibitor of S1P and found that overexpression of this inhibitor did not inhibit ATF6 localization in the Golgi, but prevented cleavage to its active, nuclear form [71] .

It would be interesting to conduct IFA in HAND cortical autopsy tissue co-labelling for ATF6\u03b2 and a Golgi matrix marker, such as GM130, to determine if ATF6\u03b2 is perhaps getting trapped in the Golgi in this disease. Alternatively, the hepatitis C virus NS4B protein is known to physically interact with ATF6\u03b2 [34], indicating the potential for this virus to modulate ATF6-meditated transcriptional activity and possibly to limit the subcellular mobility of this protein. This is of interest as HIV patients, particularly at the end of life, often suffer from many comorbidities, commonly including hepatitis C infection [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] .",

As mentioned previously, ATF6 has two forms, both of which are activated by stressors and are proteolytically cleaved to their active forms in the Golgi. The active form of ATF6\u03b1 is a stronger, yet much shorter-lived transcriptional activator than is ATF6\u03b2 [81, 82] . The roles of these two isoforms of ATF6 remain unclear. Some studies have suggested that ATF6\u03b2, when localized to the nucleus, is an inhibitor of ATF6\u03b1 transcriptional function [82] , suggesting that ATF6\u03b2 may function to regulate the strength and duration of ATF6\u03b1 activity [81] . Interestingly, ATF6\u03b2 undergoes N-glycosylation, which is necessary for its proteolytic cleavage, but is not necessary for its translocation to the Golgi [83] . This may allow for control in the timing of ATF6\u03b2 transcriptional repression of ATF6\u03b1 activity. As we see increased ATF6\u03b2 protein levels, but not high levels of nuclear ATF6\u03b2, particularly in neurones, it is possible that its N-glycosylation is being prevented to allow continued transcriptional activation of ATF6\u03b1 target genes.",

Taken together with the fact that the transcriptionally active fragment of ATF6\u03b1 is rapidly degraded, while that of ATF6\u03b2 is longer-lived, these findings that ATF6\u03b2 may not be a transcriptional repressor of ATF6\u03b1, but rather an activator of ER stress genes, suggest the possibility that ATF6\u03b1 may act as a strong immediate, but temporally limited, response to stress, while ATF6\u03b2 would be responsible for a lower-level, longer-lived response to chronic stress, such as that observed in HAND [81, 85] . The nature of the coordination between theses two isoforms of ATF6 is a highly interesting and widely applicable topic that warrants future investigations across numerous disease states.",

            "text": "Finally, we did observe a significant increase in ATF6\u03b2 in the nuclei of astrocytes, while this does not appear to be the case with neurones. These findings suggest that this pathway of the ISR shows definite differences between cell types in this disease. However, it is unclear whether its nuclear localization is prevented in neurones as a protective measure to avoid the apoptosis that can be associated with ISR activation, or whether nuclear localization of ATF6\u03b2 in neurones would be beneficial, but is failing in the CNS of HAND patients. Overexpression of a cleaved, and therefore nuclear and active, form of ATF6\u03b2 in neurones and astrocytes individually in in vitro and in vivo models of HIV-associated neurodegeneration would provide useful information in this regard. Interestingly, of the ISR proteins examined here, only ATF6\u03b2 appeared to localize to cells not positive for MAP2 or GFAP. Specifically, it appeared to show small amounts of colocalization with DAPI in cells whose nuclear morphology resembled that of oligodendrocytes, further implicating the ATF6 pathway as a contributor to BiP increases in HAND cortex [52] . Because the IFA protocols in this study were optimized to detect ISR markers in astrocytes and neurones as a follow-up to our previous report [52] , it is not improbable that other cell types express these proteins, but that they were simply not detectable by protocols used here. Future in vivo and in vitro studies designed to examine the ISR in other cell types in HAND cortex would be enlightening. Viral activation and utilization of the IRE1\u03b1/XBP1 pathway of the ISR is well documented, in particular among the neurotropic RNA flaviviruses, such as West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and dengue virus [28, 86, 87] , as well as the RNA alphavirus, Semliki Forest virus [88] . Here, unable to analyse XBP1 mRNA levels due to the nature of human autopsy tissue processing, we report that total IRE1\u03b1 protein levels do not change significantly in HIV(+) cortex or in HAND cortex compared with respective control groups. However, unexpectedly, it seems to trend towards a decrease in HIV(+) tissue. Interestingly, several viruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, the hepatitis C virus, and the human cytomegalovirus, known to activate certain components of the ISR, have also been found to either not activate the IRE1\u03b1/XBP1 arm [33] or actively inhibit it at some level [30] [31] [32] . Further, HPV-16 E5 protein has been shown to downregulate not only spliced XBP1, but also IRE1\u03b1 itself [24] . In vitro models of HIV infection of the CNS, as well as in vivo animal models, are critical to further elucidate the role of the IRE1\u03b1/XBP1 pathway in the brain in this disease, particularly because analysis of XBP1 splicing is key to fully understanding this pathway, and thus systems which allow harvest of mRNA are needed.",

Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 inhibits its function in the initiation of translation causing a general suppression of the translation of new proteins [89, 90] . However, the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 actually increases the translation of a subset of proteins that include an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in their 5\u2032untranslated region [91] , such as ATF4. Importantly, eIF2\u03b1 is the target of several other kinases in addition to PERK, including double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and GCN2 [49] . As mentioned previously, the ISR possesses both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic roles [92] , and peIF2\u03b1 is capable of both [93] . In particular, one study suggested that the timing of phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 may determine whether it is pro-survival or pro-apoptotic in its function, and further, this study suggested that the nature of the role of peIF2\u03b1 in a given stress response may be influenced by the kinase that phosphorylates it under any given stress [93] . While all kinases known to target peIF2\u03b1 do phosphorylate it on its serine 51 (S51), these kinases themselves are differentially regulated and perhaps the timing of their activation or the identities of their other target proteins affect whether peIF2\u03b1 will play a pro-survival or a pro-apoptotic role. Interestingly, while we examined eIF2\u03b1 as a part of the PERK pathway of the ISR, one must consider that another kinase could potentially phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 in the cortex of these patients. Of particular interest is PKR, given that it responds to double-stranded RNA, as well as to interferon [49] , and also considering that the increase of peIF2\u03b1 was more striking in HIV(+) tissue over HIV(\u2212) tissue, than in HAND tissue over neurocognitively normal controls. Muaddi et al. [93] show data suggesting a pro-survival role for PERK and PKR, and a pro-apoptotic role for GCN2, although other studies have suggested that PKR often has pro-death function.",

In contrast, we found that ATF4 levels do not change in the cytoplasm of neurones and actually increase in the cytoplasm of astrocytes. These apparently contradictory findings are reconcilable when one takes into account that ATF4 in the cytoplasm of astrocytes makes up a very small amount of the total observed ATF4 and also that several neuronal cells show very strong ATF4 nuclear staining, which is not surprising given that ATF4 is a transcription factor. Interestingly, we did not see any change in nuclear ATF4 in astrocytes, even though we observed an increase in cytoplasmic ATF4 in these cells. This finding strongly suggests that ATF4 is not contributing to the increased BiP levels we had observed previously in HAND [52] .",

            "text": "One possible explanation for the general overall decrease in ATF4 levels despite an increase in peIF2\u03b1 levels relates back to the multiple functionality of peIF2\u03b1. Conceivably, in HIV(+) tissue and in HAND, eIF2\u03b1 may function mostly to inhibit global protein translation and may not promote the specific expression of ATF4 protein. Additionally, the increases of peIF2\u03b1 staining were far more apparent in HIV(+) tissue than they were in HAND tissue compared with respective controls, while total and nuclear ATF4 decreases are seen in HAND tissue, but not in HIV(+) tissue, suggesting an alternate method of regulation of ATF4 expression in this case. Interestingly, although ATF4 is usually discussed as a translationally regulated protein, there is evidence that it is transcriptionally regulated as well. In particular, another study found that phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 failed to increase expression of ATF4 in their model, and that, rather, ATF4 was regulated at the transcriptional level by TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF)mediated signalling through toll-like receptors 3 and 4 [94] . Further, a recent study suggests a stimulus-dependent transcriptional regulation of ATF4 that alters the amount of ATF4 mRNA available for translational upregulation by peIF2\u03b1 [95] . Finally, another study showed that, under conditions of oxidative stress, retinal pigment epithelial ARPE-19/ HPV-16 cells demonstrate transcriptional regulation of ATF4 [96] . This study is particularly interesting in the context of viral infection of the brain because the cells studied in this paper are transformed with the HPV-16 DH5 protein; another study has shown an HPV-16 transforming protein, E5, capable of downregulating components of the ISR [24] . Whether the alteration in ATF4 expression we observed in the study presented here represents a failure of the ISR to protect in HAND or whether it is actually a regulatory mechanism functioning to protect cells from the pro-apoptotic side of the ISR is unclear, but could be examined in an in vitro model of HIV-induced neuronal degeneration.",

We saw no significant change in either of these proteins, and surprisingly, CHOP even trended towards a decrease. As the tissue used in these studies is from the end stage of disease, it is certainly possible that most cells that expressed CHOP have already died, and thus are not contributing protein to lysates harvested from the cortical autopsy tissue. Alternatively, in ISR activation associated with viral infection, not all target genes are equally activated. Specifically, hepatitis C virus, an RNA virus, increases BiP, but not CHOP [29] . Additionally, African swine fever virus, a DNA virus, actively inhibits induction of CHOP [23] . While this property of active inhibition of apoptosis seems to be more common of DNA viruses than of RNA viruses, it is not inconceivable that HIV could employ a similar mechanism. That HIV does not productively infect neurones and astrocytes makes this scenario less appealing, but it still may warrant future investigation.",

            "text": "Here we present the initial studies designed to characterize the nature of the ISR response in HAND. Our findings clearly show that the ISR does not respond in an all-or-none fashion in HAND, but rather demonstrates a nuanced activation pattern in this disease, as summarized in Figure 11 and in Table 1 . In particular, our finding that ATF6 increases in the nuclei of astrocytes while ATF4 does not, implicates the ATF6 pathway of the ISR as a more likely candidate than the PERK pathway for the increases in BiP levels in astrocytes that we had observed previously [52] (summarized in Figure 12 ). Of note, the neurovirulent Moloney murine leukemia virus, which causes a syndrome in mice similar to the immunodeficiency and neurodegeneration seen in HIV-infected patients, also induces ISR activation in astrocytes [97] . That ISR activation is increased in astrocytes in these viral infections is interesting. While increases in protective ISR proteins such as BiP are likely beneficial to astrocytes, chronic astrocytic activation of other components of the ISR might eventually contribute to neuronal toxicity in this disease. Specifically, the xCT subunit of the cysteine/ glutamate exchange transporter (xC) is a downstream gene target of the ISR through transactivation by the bZIP transcription factor Nrf2 [98, 99] . xC plays a critical role in the production of glutathione, an important component of the cellular antioxidant response; however, to do so, it exports astrocytic glutamate into the extracellular milieu, potentially contributing to an excitotoxic environment and ultimately to neuronal death [100, 101] . The data presented in this paper compose an important novel foray into the characterization of the ISR response in HAND, which will be necessary if we are to understand whether this catch-all stress pathway is merely unsuccessful in its attempts to protect neurones from death in the toxic environment of the HIV-infected CNS and should thus be supported in its function via therapeutic intervention or whether the ISR is actively destroying neurones in this disease and should therefore be inhibited by any potential therapeutic interventions. Alternatively, it may be the case and is likely that some aspects of the ISR are protective in this disease while others are apoptotic. Mechanistic in vitro studies and animal models of HIV infection, such as SIV-infected macaques, will be invaluable in gaining a full understanding into the nuances of ISR activation following HIV-infection, which is vital to the development of therapies to prevent progression to HAND and to treat patients already suffering from this devastating disease.

Coomassie staining of the PVDF membrane was used as a loading control for normalization of protein levels for quantification and statistical analysis as shown in B-D. #P < 0.05, compared with control, Student's t-test for two-way comparisons and one-way anova for three-way comparisons and Mann-Whitney U post-hoc analysis. Groups were compared using one-way anova and HIV(+) cases, both neurocognitively normal (n = 6) and HAND (n = 7), were found to increase significantly over HIV(\u2212) cases (n = 4). HAND cases, n = 7; neurocognitively normal cases, n = 10; HIV(+) cases, n = 13; HIV(\u2212), n = 4. Values are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM.

The third panel shows higher magnification images of astrocytes, which are denoted by asterisks [HIV(\u2212) control] or arrowheads [HIV(+) cases]. (B and C) ATF4 protein levels from confocal images (five per case) were quantified by determining integrated pixel intensity using Metamorph 6.0 software.
