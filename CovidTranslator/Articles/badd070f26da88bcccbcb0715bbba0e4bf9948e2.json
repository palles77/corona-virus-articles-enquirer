Dengue fever (DF), dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) are progressively more severe clinical manifestations of dengue infection caused by four, single-strand RNA flaviviruses known as DEN-1-4.

The virus replicates in lymph nodes, spleen, liver and mononuclear phagocytic cells in other tissue systems.",

            "text": "In the Americas, the transition from DF to DHF and DSS occurred in Cuba in 1981, when an Asian genotype virus (DEN-2) was introduced into a DEN-1-immune population 2 . By contrast, when the American genotype DEN-2 infected a DEN-1-immune population in Iquitos, Peru, only mild disease resulted 3, 4 . Differences in the outcome of secondary infection seem to be due to the high level of cross-neutralization between DEN-1 antibodies and the DEN-2 virus 5 . It is hypothesized that Asian dengue strains that successfully circulate in highly dengue-immune populations have lost cross-reactive epitopes, as a mechanism of immune escape. Important for the development of DHF/DSS is enhanced viral replication during the early stage of infection 6 , which is apparently mediated by non-neutralizing antibodies that are residual from an earlier dengue infection and is known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) 7 . So, early infection, the time interval between first and second infection 8 , virus strain and host genetic factors are involved in severity of the disease outcome. Plasma leakage, the main patho-physiological feature of DHF, seems to be particularly correlated with blood concentrations of cytokines (such as IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1) and infected cell lysis, owing to dengue-specific T lymphocytes 9 . The ultimate causes of haemorrhage due to vasculopathy, platelet reduction or dysfunction and prothrombin-complex deficiency are even less clear, although plateletactivating factors and, potentially, platelet-destroying mechanisms have been described 10, 11 .",

Circulating antibodies to human SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and/or animal SARS CoV-like virus were detected in 17 serum samples collected from 938 healthy adults in 2001. The authors speculate that the viruses circulating in 2001 are antigenically closer to the animal SARS CoV-like virus than the human SARS Co-V and failed to adapt successfully to a human host.
