A reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was developed assay to amplify the genome of RSV subgroups A and B, in order to improve current diagnostic methods for RSV infection. The primer sets for RT-LAMP were designed using highly conserved nucleotide sequences in the matrix protein region of subgroups A and B, and were specific for each subgroup. The RT-LAMP efficiency was compared to virus isolation and a commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for RSV detection (BD Directigen EZ RSV test TM ), using nasopharyngeal aspirates from 59 children with respiratory tract infections. The RT-LAMP was specific for RSV and could not detect other respiratory pathogens. 61% (36/59) of children were positive by RT-LAMP, 34% (20/59) by viral isolation, and 56% (26/46) by EZ RSV. Of 16 specimens that were negative by both antigen detection and virus isolation, 12.5% (2/16) were RT-LAMP positive. These results suggest that the RT-LAMP is more sensitive than other methods used to detect RSV. The RT-LAMP assay developed in this study may be useful for diagnostic and epidemiological studies of RSV infection.",

            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) belongs to the genus Pneumovirus in the subfamily Pneumovirinae of the family Paramyxoviridae, and is a major causative agent of respiratory tract infections in children worldwide. Children born preterm or with underlying cardiopulmonary disorders are at especially high risk of developing severe and lethal RSV respiratory tract infections (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003; Girard et al., 2005; Saijo et al., 1993 Saijo et al., , 1994 . Elderly and immunocompromised individuals are also susceptible to severe respiratory diseases, highlighting the importance of preventing nasocomial and in-house RSV infections in hospitals and care centers for the elderly (Englund et al., 1988; Falsey and Walsh, 2000) . Palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody with neutralizing activity against RSV, was developed recently and made available commercially as an effective prophylaxis against disease (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003) . Thus, precise diagnostic and epidemiological tests are important for the prevention of RSV infections. The diagnosis of RSV infection is generally undertaken by virus isolation and/or antigen detection using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Dayan et al., 2002; Falsey et al., 2002; Reina et al., 2004) . However, because of the thermolability of RSV, the rate of isolation is dependent on conditions such as sample collection and cold chain from sample collection to cell inoculation. EIAs are useful as bed-side diagnostic tools in clinical settings, however their sensitivity and specificity are generally between 70 and 90%, suggesting that misdiagnosis of RSV infection is common (10-30%) (Grondahl et al., 2005; Ohm-Smith et al., 2004; Wren et al., 1990) . In addition, it is difficult to detect RSV antigen in nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from adults, since only a small amount of RSV antigen can be found (Casiano-Colon et al., 2003; Falsey et al., 2002; Falsey and Walsh, 2000) . The development of more sensitive and specific detection methods is therefore essential for more precise diagnoses of RSV. As a result, molecular methods such as reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative real-time RT-PCR have been developed for the detection of RSV (Falsey et al., 2002 Gilbert et al., 1996) .",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was developed recently to amplify specific nucleic acid sequences using a designated primer set (Nagamine et al., 2002; Notomi et al., 2000) . Amplification by LAMP is simple, since the reaction mixture is incubated at a single temperature for less than 1 h, and specificity is high because at least six specific primer region sequences are required for construction of the LAMP primer set (Nagamine et al., 2002; Notomi et al., 2000) . The amplified product level can be monitored in a real-time quantitative manner by measuring turbidity since nucleic acid amplification results in the precipitation of magnesium pyrophosphate (Mori et al., 2001) . The LAMP assay can also be used with RNA templates by combining reverse transcription reactions with LAMP (RT-LAMP) (Notomi et al., 2000) . Genetic diagnosis by RT-LAMP has been developed for infections caused by RNA viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile encephalitis, and Dengue fever (Hong et al., 2004; Parida et al., 2004 Parida et al., , 2005 . Ushio et al. (2005) recently developed RT-LAMP for detection of the RSV genome and the primers used in their method were designed according to the nucleotide sequence of the nucleoprotein region. Highly conserved sequences of the nucleotide sequence are located in the matrix protein region of RSV isolates, suggesting that this region was a suitable target for designing LAMP primers. In the present study, a RT-LAMP method was developed in which the LAMP primers were designed from the matrix protein gene, and the competence of this assay was compared to virus isolation and EIA.",

            "text": "RSV infections are usually detected by virus isolation or EIAs. The virus isolation method, however, is only able to detect infectious virus. RSV is thermolabile and the quantity of infectious particles depends on sample preparation and storage conditions. Thus, isolation of RSV can be difficult and RSV infection runs the risk of being overlooked if this is the only method used. EIA kits do not require infectious viral antigens for detection and can be carried out easily in a short time (approximately 15 min), and are considered useful for general clinical diagnosis of young children (Ohm-Smith et al., 2004; Wren et al., 1990) . However, misdiagnosis can occur in 10-30% of RSV infections when the EIA kit is used alone (Grondahl et al., 2005) . RSV is not detected easily in specimens from adult patients using either virus isolation or the EIA kit, because neutralizing antibodies maintain the virus titer low (Casiano-Colon et al., 2003; Falsey et al., 2002; Falsey and Walsh, 2000) . Molecular diagnostic methods can detect viruses as long as genomic sequences exist, regardless of the integrity of the virus particle. As a result, molecular diagnostics method should be undertaken for definitive diagnosis of RSV. The LAMP assay is simpler and quicker than RT-PCR (Hong et al., 2004; Parida et al., 2004) , and results can be obtained by viewing fluorescence or determining turbidity values without opening the sample tubes, minimizing concerns about contaminating amplified products. In addition, expensive fluorescent probes and detection instruments that are required for real-time PCR, are unnecessary for the LAMP assay. Therefore, the LAMP assay is useful for qualitative detection of RSV, and RT-LAMP can be used to amplify quantitatively the virus genome in real-time (Hong et al., 2004) . The RT-LAMP assay may be useful not only for diagnostic tests but also for prognosis. In this study, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children with respiratory tract infections, and RT-LAMP was able to detect the RSV genome. The RT-LAMP assay developed in this study also detected RSV genomes in samples that were negative by virus isolation and EIA, suggesting that RT-LAMP is a more sensitive assay for the detection of RSV antigens and is more useful in diagnosing RSV infections than classical methods. The RT-LAMP assay may also be used for diagnosing RSV infections in adults, although further studies are required to test this. In this study, supernatants of nasopharyngeal aspirates were used to detect RSV using the RT-LAMP assay. Since some paramyxovirus virions are cell associated (Wechsler et al., 1985) , this assay may be even more sensitive if the cells are not spun out.",

However, the specificity of this method of RSV detection was only tested against three influenza virus strains. In contrast, we examined the specificity of the RT-LAMP technique against multiple respiratory pathogens, including metapneumovirus, influenza viruses, human coronaviruses, adenoviruses, and bacteria, and found that they were not amplified. When clinical specimens were tested using the RT-LAMP primer set described above and that described by Ushio et al. (2005) RSV genome detection was comparable. Thus, the sensitivity of our RT-LAMP assay described is equivalent to Ushio's method (2005) . Since RSV is a negative strand RNA virus that develops frequent mutations, two or more primer sets may be preferable for diagnosis. The RT-LAMP assay presented in this report should aid laboratory diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance of RSV infection.",
