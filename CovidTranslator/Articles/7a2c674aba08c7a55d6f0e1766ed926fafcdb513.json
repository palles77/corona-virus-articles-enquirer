            "text": "H ealth officials meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, in March 2006 for a 4-day conference on emerging infectious diseases discussed the increased incidence of animals serving as the leading source of new human diseases and issued a warning that more trained professionals and resources will be needed to combat them. Lonnie King, acting director of a new U.S. research office for studying such diseases, is reported as noting that three-quarters of all new human diseases in the past 3 decades and 80 percent of microbes considered among the most dangerous possible bioterrorist weapons originated in animals. 1 Among these diseases are such global public health threats such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian flu, and, now, the little-known chikungunya, a virus originating in monkeys. Since the beginning of 2006, chikungunya, a crippling mosquito-borne disease, has shown an explosive emergence in nations in the Indian Ocean area. An increased incidence of the disease was reported first in February of the previous year in the French island of La R\u00e9union, with sporadic but regular cases being reported until December. During the next month, however, the incidence increased considerably, causing concern in Paris, where Minister Baroin held a news conference to announce that French authorities were sending military troops to the island to reinforce efforts of 2800 health care workers, administrative staff, and other personnel who were working to eradicate the virus. 2 This article provides a review of the recent emergence and current epidemic and a brief description of the disease.",

            "text": "The first epidemic of the disease was recognized in East Africa in 1952 to 1953. 3 Between 1954 and 1986, the chikungunya virus was implicated as the cause of epidemics in Asian countries, including the Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, India, Burma, and Sri Lanka. Although the disease later all but disappeared in India, Sri Lanka, Burma, 4 and Bangkok, 5 outbreaks and sporadic cases continued to occur in Thailand and the Philippines. Epidemics were documented in the Philippines in 1954, 1956, and 1968. 6,7 Serosurveys suggested that virus activity occurred in the central and southern part of the archipelago. 8 Between 1982 and 1985, the virus spread into Indonesia for the first time, with outbreaks occurring in South Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Timor, Nusatengarra, and the Mollucas Islands. 9 In 1986, three cases of chikungunya fever were diagnosed among U.S. Peace Corps volunteers stationed in the Republic of the Philippines. The three cases, the first ones reported from the Philippines since 1968, were diagnosed using an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. One case occurred in Mindanao, one of the southernmost islands of the archipelago; the second occurred on Cebu, one of the islands in the central portion; and the third case occurred on the island of Masbate, also in the central part of the country but north of Cebu. 10 Three epidemics have been reported in Senegal, in 1966, 11 1982, 12 and 1999. 13 Between 1972 and 1999, 178 chikungunya virus strains were isolated from mosquitoes caught in Kedougou. Four major sylvatic occurrence of chikungunya virus were observed in 1975, 1979, 1983 , and 1992. The major sylvatic vectors (Aedes furcifer, Aedes taylori, and Aedes luteocephalus) are the same as those for yellow fever virus. The sylvatic form (Aedes aegypti formosus) does not appear to be involved in transmission because no strain of the virus has ever been isolated from it. The only domestic vector of yellow fever identified, Aedes aegypti (Figs 1A and B) , is also the only mosquito species found associated with chikungunya virus in human habitats of Senegal. Researchers also observed periods of 3 or 4 years during which no viruses were isolated, except for the 1987 to 1992 period. In all of Senegal, 185 strains of the virus were isolated from 13 mosquito species. 13 More recently, 24 distinct outbreaks of probable chikungunya etiology were identified in Indonesia between September 2001 and March 2003. These outbreaks, 13 of which were based on clinical observations alone and 11 confirmed by serological/virological methods, were the first incidences after almost 20 years. The incidences in Bogor and Bekasi, where the rates were 2.8/100 and 6.7/100, respectively, occurred during the rainy season after reported increased densities of A. aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes ( Fig. 2A and B). 14 During this same period of time, incidents were reported in Southeast Asia, where in 2001 many countries neighboring Malaysia had outbreaks of human infections. At that time, outbreaks had not occurred in Malaysia since the one that occurred between December 1998 and February 1999, although concern was expressed that the disease might be reintroduced into the country by the movement of migrant workers. 15 The 1999 outbreak had involved 51 confirmed cases in a densely populated urban area. 9 That same year (2001), the first surveillance conducted in India since the previous epidemic of 1971 revealed widely circulating lowvirulent chikungunya virus in A. aegypti mosquitoes as a possible explanation for an epidemiological pattern of the disease in that region. 16 The first documentation of epidemic transmission in Yogyakarta, Indonesia since 1982 was reported in 2004. 17 Similarly, a 39-year period without any isolation of the virus was broken by a resurgence of incidence in 2004 in Kinshasa Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the virus was isolated in sera from nine patients with clinical symptoms. 18 ",

            "text": "An extensive outbreak of chikungunya fever was reported first on the French island of La R\u00e9union, where between March 28, 2005, and January 15, 2006, an estimated 10,750 suspected cases were reported and 2424 were confirmed by laboratory analysis. A limited peak first occurred in mid-May 2005, the number of cases then decreasing with the onset of the southern hemisphere winter. 19 From mid-July, the incidence remained stable for longer than 3 months before rising again, initially moderately, at the beginning of October and increasing exponentially in December. In addition to the increased incidence, as of January 27, 2006, 15 cases of meningoencephalitis had been reported, 12 of which were microbiologically confirmed. Six of the cases were newborns, with mother-to-child transmission strongly suspected. Six adult cases also were reported and confirmed by the national reference center in elderly patients. 20 Despite the spraying of pesticides that had been performed throughout the French island of R\u00e9union, 15,000 persons were afflicted in the last week of January, and 20,000 more came down with the disease during the first week of February. By February 8, 2006 , French officials had reported that approximately 70,000, nearly one in 10, inhabitants of the island had been infected, and 300 French soldiers were being sent to get the outbreak under control. 2 On February 26th and 27th, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin visited the island and promised further health research would be implemented, but despite all the efforts exerted, the epidemic continued spreading without so much as slowing (Fig. 3) . 21 By the first week of April, the entire island was affected, with particularly high activity occurring in the southern parts. Approximately 236,000 cases were estimated to have occurred, although the weekly number was beginning to decline. 22 By the first week in March, the virus had spread to the islands of Seychelles, Mauritius, and Mayotte (French). In Seychelles, approximately 2500 cases were reported during January and the early part of February, with the number doubling each week. By the first week in March, that number had jumped to more than 8800 suspected cases. 23 Mauritius, the closest neighbor of R\u00e9union, had reported more than 2500 cases by March 7, 22 the day that Lee Jong-Wook, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), went to Mauritius to meet with Mauritian government officials to discuss how the United Nations (UN) agency could assist in fighting the epidemic. 23 By March 17, that number had increased to 6000 suspected cases and 1200 confirmed cases. 23 On the island of Mayotte, the outbreak did not start until late January, but within 6 weeks 1000 cases had been registered. 21 The number of suspected cases had increased to 2833 on March 10, 2006. 23 The governments of both islands initiated harsh measures, with spraying and fogging machines and some 100,000 liters of insecticides being ordered from abroad once the epidemic spread, but the disease only continued to spread.",

The outbreak, thought to have started sometime in February, was concentrated on the eastern coastal city of Toamasina. Concerns were raised that it might spread across the island and find a permanent refuge there, thereby rendering the eradication of the virus from the Indian Ocean region close to impossible. 21 In Andhra Pradesh state of India, a mixed outbreak of chikungunya with sporadic cases of dengue has been reported. Between December 1, 2005, and February 17, 2006, 5671 cases of fever with arthralgia were reported. A high density of A. aegypti mosquitoes also was observed. During the first 2 weeks of March, more than 2000 cases of chikungunya were reported from the Malegaon town in Nasik district, Maharashtra state, India. Another 4904 cases of fever associated with myalgia and headache were reported between February 27 and March 5, 2006 in Orissa state, India. All of the signs are consistent with an arbovirus outbreak. 23 Malaysia also reported the first outbreak since 1999, when 27 people were infected in Port Klang, Selangor. In March 2006, the Health Department of Malaysia was alerted by a general practitioner concerning 30 people who were found to have symptoms similar to those of chikungunya infections. Laboratory tests confirmed that the cases were chikungunya, and fogging, cleaning, and other public health strategies were implemented. 24 The first ever case of chikungunya in Hong Kong SAR was reported on March 31. The case of a 66-year-old Chinese man was seen in the Prince of Wales Hospital Infectious Diseases clinic on March 24, after returning from a 1-week stay in Mauritius. The case was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing at the Public Health Laboratory Centre. 25 \"Imported \" cases also have been reported in France, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, China, and French Guyana.",

            "text": "It is related most closely seriologically to o'nyong-nyong virus and is a member of the Semliki Forest antigenic complex. Two distinct strains, one from Western Africa and the other from southern and Eastern Africa, as well as Asia, have been delineated. The different genotypes of the latter strain exhibit differences in their transmission cycles: in Asia, the virus appears to be maintained in an urban cycle with A. aegypti mosquito vectors, whereas transmission of the virus in Africa involves a sylvatic cycle, primarily with Aedes furcifer and Aedes africanus mosquitoes. Phylogenetic trees demonstrate that the virus originated in Africa and subsequently was introduced into Asia. 29 It has been shown to be distinct from o'nyong-nyong virus. 29, 30 In 2002, the complete genomic sequence of chikungunya virus was determined: the complete genome was 11,805 nucleotides in length, excluding the t' cap nucleotide, an I-poly(A) tract and the 3= poly(A) tail; it comprised two long open reading frames that encoded the nonstructural (2474 amino acids) and structural (1244 amino acids) polyproteins. 30 Hosts Chikungunya virus is able to replicate in a broad spectrum of vertebrate species. Newborn mice, hamsters, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and kittens all have been infected by subcutaneous inoculation of field strains of the virus. Neutralizing or hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies to chikungunya have been recovered from sera obtained from ungulates. Verbet monkeys and baboons are infected readily, and rhesus monkeys infected by intravenous and intramuscular inoculation had viremia titers in excess of 10 7 mouse LD 50 . Subhuman primate populations are affected in epizootics that involve large numbers of the susceptible population, followed by disappearance of the virus. Hence, chikungunya virus possibly is maintained in wildlife populations by its constantly moving epizootic activity, much as respiratory and enteric virus infections are maintained in humans. 31 Human acquisition occurs typically by the bite of an infected A. aegypti mosquito, although other competent mosquito vectors exist. 27 Epidemics are sustained by human-mosquito-human transmission. 28",

Clinical diagnosis can be made based on the prevalence of the disease in the area and on clinical signs noted above. Differential diagnosis includes the viral causes of dengue fever syndrome. Although the symptoms of chikungunya are similar to those of dengue, distinct differences exist: chikungunya infections are shorter in duration; a terminal maculopapular rash, arthralgia or arthritis, and conjunctival infection are more common; and hemorrhagic phenomena rarely occur. 31 Treatment Currently, no vaccine is available. Treatment is symptomatic only and includes nonsteroid antiinflammatories and anonsalicyclic analgesics. Bed rest is advised during the febrile period, with provision of antipyretics or cold sponging to keep the body temperature less than 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F). Mild sedation may be required to control pain. Febrile convulsions should be treated with Phenobarbital given intravenously or orally and continued until the temperature returns to normal. Severe or intractable convulsions may respond to intravenous diazepam. Children who cannot take oral fluids may need intravenous rehydration. Patients with severe hemorrhagic phenomena should be examined for underlying hemostatic disorders. 31 ",

Mosquito repellent based on a 30 percent DEET concentration is recommended. For children younger than 3 months, repellents are not recommended; instead, insecticide-treated bed nets should be used. 22 A. aegypti mosquitoes deposit their eggs in any outdoor container that can hold water (Fig. 4a-c) . These containers include large uncovered jars for drinking water and refuse receptacles such as bottles and food tins. Hence, measures to be taken at the community level include reducing the prevalence of mosquito breeding sites by removing all open containers with stagnant water in and around buildings and/or treatment with larvicides. The quickest way to effectively reduce the mosquito population and to interrupt the transmission to use space spraying application, which knocks down the mosquitoes instantly. Aerial spraying with insecticides may be required in certain areas. The WHO recommends applying the appropriate products in intervals that are shorter than the incubation period of the pathogen in the vector and in accordance with the generation cycle of the vector. 22 Measures must be taken four to five times at 5-day intervals during the \"attack phase.\" This approach ensures that the full generation cycle of the mosquitoes is broken. Thereafter a maintenance program (larvicide and periodical space spraying) should be followed to keep the mosquito population under control. 32 ",
