            "text": "This paper follows up an unexpected finding from a community survey that identified drinking and smoking as the most important tuberculosis (TB) risk factor, far ahead of ones commonly associated with TB such as poverty, overcrowded living conditions, and HIV-positive status. It reports perceptions of drinking and smoking from a three-phased study of the stigma associated with TB, consisting of a qualitative pilot study using focus-group discussions (2006), a larger-scale community survey (2007), and followup group discussions (2009). The community attitude survey was conducted with a sample of 1,020 adults living in a low-income township in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The study found that the moral and the biomedical understanding of TB risk are intertwined. In the community survey, perceptions of drinking and smoking as TB risk were predicted by fear of contracting TB and being a self-reported born-again Christian. In the follow-up study, heavy drinking and smoking in shebeens (unlicensed township liquor outlets) was associated with a risky lifestyle that can spread both TB and HIV. The paper discusses the similarities and differences in the roles of church and shebeen in providing social support to township dwellers to cope with problems of daily life. It is tentatively concluded that the stereotypical shebeen 'drinkers and smokers', alternatively pitied and maligned by moral society, might serve as the scapegoat that deflects pollution from the 'new' TB linked to the AIDS epidemic.",

Some experts speak of 'three' epidemics. The 'first' refers to the resurgence of tuberculosis in the early 1980s. HIV-related V. M\u00f8ller (&) \u00c1 I. Erstad \u00c1 D. Zani Institute of Social and Economic Research, Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa e-mail: v.moller@ru.ac.za TB is known as the 'second' epidemic. The surge of multi-drug resistant TB is designated the 'third' epidemic (Maurya et al. 2002) . The Eastern Cape province of South Africa, where our study site is located, has been hit by all three epidemics. The first epidemic was introduced to the Eastern Cape by migrant workers returning home from the gold mines (Packard 1992) . With regard to the second epidemic, currently an estimated 58.8% of TB cases in the Eastern Cape are co-infected with HIV (SAIRR 2008:435) . The 'third' epidemic arrived in 2006, when cases of extremely drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) were first detected in neighbouring KwaZulu-Natal province, and then in all other South African provinces, including the Eastern Cape. The study reported here aimed to examine the role of stigma in undermining the control of tuberculosis in a region that has experienced the three TB epidemics in succession. Our study focuses on drinkers and smokers as a possible stereotype or ostracised group in society that is blamed for spreading TB.",

Known as the 'white' plague, tuberculosis was brought to South Africa around the turn of the nineteenth century by British and European immigrants seeking their fortunes on the Witwatersrand. Many passed TB onto African men working on the goldmines who were susceptible due to the overcrowded and generally poor working and living conditions in the compounds. Miners too sick to work were sent back to their rural homes. The worst hit by the epidemic was the Eastern Cape, one of the largest reservoirs of mine workers (Packard 1992) . Today tuberculosis is endemic in the Eastern Cape. Eight of the 21 TB hospital centres operating countrywide are in the Eastern Cape. One of these hospitals is in Grahamstown East/Rhini, Makana Municipality, the site of the present study. The province's multiple-drug-resistant TB hospital is located in the nearest coastal city, some 130 km away.",

Stigmatised individuals are variously shunned, isolated, ridiculed and coldshouldered. The consequences of stigma are remarkably similar in different health conditions and cultures (van Brakel 2006) . Stigma is known to delay treatment and to lead to non-adherence to treatment of various diseases, particularly self-inflicted ones.

Given the high incidence of twin infections, it can be expected that the stigma related to HIV also impacts on the control of TB. Until recently, the ruling African National Congress government denied that the HI-virus is the cause of AIDS-ostensibly so as not to project South Africans as a promiscuous people-and the health minister advocated a regimen of beetroot and garlic instead of treatment with antiretrovirals. The stigma related to AIDS has been fuelled by this denialism. It was only in 2004 that the government consented to the rollout of antiretrovirals in public health clinics. Over 300,000 unnecessary deaths have been attributed to the delay (Chigwedere et al. 2008 ).",

African studies have found that HIV and TB are seen to be closely linked and highly stigmatised (Gelaw et al. 2001; Godfrey-Faussett et al. 2002) . However, several international studies, as well as our own, have found that a lesser stigma is commonly associated with TB than with HIV/AIDS mainly owing to the mode of transmission (Nichter 1994; Balabanova et al. 2006; Macq et al. 2006; Mak et al. 2006; Daftary et al. 2007; M\u00f8ller and Erstad 2007) . Sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV tend to be associated with an immoral lifestyle that underpins stigmatisation. A Russian study found that TB was known as a 'clean' disease; HIV/AIDS as a 'dirty' disease (Balabanova et al. 2006) . A study conducted in Hong Kong that compared the public stigma related to AIDS, TB and SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) found AIDS was associated with the most stigma, followed first by TB, then by SARS (Mak et al. 2006 ).",

In the South African context, the government's denialist stance towards the AIDS epidemic has served to increase the fear and stigma associated with HIV-infection, that in turn has spilled over onto TB. Daftary et al. (2007) observed that co-infected South African TB patients used a strategy described by Goffman (1963) in his classical study of stigma as 'covering'. A person with several discreditable attributes 'covers' the dominant stigma with a less damaging one. In the South African study, individuals co-infected with TB and HIV/AIDS preferred to disclose TB rather than HIV as it was seen to be less stigmatising. AIDS as the dominant stigma was associated with personal blame and immoral behaviour while TB was less likely to be perceived as being morally reprehensible (Daftary et al. 2007) . Other examples in the literature demonstrate that members of marginal groups may adopt an identity that defines them in opposition to a stigmatising label (Collins et al. 2008; Lichtenstein 2008 ).",

According to Deacon's (2005) extensive literature review, disease stigma can be understood as a problem of fear and blame rather than as a problem of ignorance. Importantly, stigma may consist of beliefs that are part of a social process that differentiates against those with a Drinking, Smoking, and Morality 219 disease in negative social as well as biological terms. Stigma as it is portrayed in Goffman's (1963) classical description attributes blame, shame and abhorrence, particularly to marginalised groups. People gain an illusion of control by attributing risk-enhancing behaviour to the 'other' (Crawford 1994) . Attributing medical conditions to lack of personal responsibility helps to distance the 'moral majority' from risk (Deacon 2005) . Thus, stigmatisation can be seen as a protective response to a threat or adverse situation (Gilmore and Somerville 1994) .",

The specific behaviour expected of morally upright citizens may differ according to the cultural setting (Alonzo and Reynolds 1995; Link and Phelan 2001; Lichtenstein 2008) . Typically, marginal groups are blamed for engaging in a lifestyle which involves risky behaviour that results in infection, then for perpetuating the epidemic by defaulting on treatment due to these habits (Ware et al. 2005) . The second TB epidemic has often represented AIDS as divine punishment for transgressing religious or moral principles (Gilmore and Somerville 1994) . Throughout history, people with infectious diseases have been turned into scapegoats that ritualistically expel 'evil' from a community or society. According to Gilmore and Somerville (1994) the scapegoated person must be human enough to carry away the 'sins' of the community. The scapegoat must also be dehumanised in order to be isolated, ostracised, or in some way separated from the scapegoating community so it can expel those 'sins'. Historically, the ritual of scapegoating involved two goats, a good and an evil one. One was sacrificed to the gods, the other exiled into the desert. Schmidt (2008) notes that for centuries, TB has been linked anecdotally with environmental risk factors that go hand in hand with poverty such as indoor pollution, tobacco smoke, malnutrition, overcrowded living conditions and excessive alcohol use. Empirical studies of attribution have found that drinking and smoking are popularly considered a risk factor for TB. For example, a community study conducted in rural India identified addictions such as smoking, alcohol and drug use as a cause of TB and found an association between TB and sexual experience (Atre et al. 2004 ). Nichter's (1994) study of illness semantics in the Philippines found that excessive habits of smoking, drinking and sex were thought to place one at risk of TB by weakening the general state of health.",

In the scale developed by van Rie et al.

A major problem is that drinking and smoking tend to go hand in hand so it is difficult to disentangle the effects of the two habits (Schmidt 2008) . Social gatherings where drinking and smoking take place are common sites for TB transmission (Zuger 1999) and alcohol consumption and smoking may be proxies for frequenting locations that put one at raised risk of close contact with infectious individuals (Harling et al. 2008) . In their review of the medical literature, Maurya et al. (2002) found only 16 studies published between 1956 and 2002 that included the keywords 'smoking' and 'tuberculosis'. The evidence from these 16 studies suggested that smoking should be considered an important risk factor for TB. The reviewers note that authors expected most drinkers to be in the TB group because of the known association between drinking and smoking: most drinkers were also smokers (Maurya et al. 2002) . More recently, the multilevel analysis of South Africa's TB epidemic by Harling et al. (2008) concluded that alcohol abuse, cigarette smoking, and low body mass index each independently provided a risk factor for TB even after adjusting for the socio-economic status.",

            "text": "A pertinent question in the South African context of TB-HIV co-infection is whether there is an association between drinking, smoking and HIV-infection. South Africa has a double burden of HIV and alcohol abuse (Morejele et al. 2006 ). Some 5.5 million in a population of approximately 48 million are HIV positive. The amount of alcohol consumed per adult is among the highest in the world (Parry 2005) . Problem or binge drinking is strongly associated with the number of sexual partners a person has had and with unprotected sexual activity (Raj et al. 2009 ). Several recent South African studies support the link between alcohol consumption, alcohol outcome expectancies and sexually risky behaviour that are related to HIV transmission risks (Kalichman et al. 2006 (Kalichman et al. , 2007 . However, other studies suggest youthfulness and sensation-seeking (Greene et al. 2000) and drug use (Ehrenstein et al. 2004 ) may need to be factored into the equation. Alcohol use before sex is consistently related to sexual risk practices and should be considered a marker for sexually transmitted infections and HIV risks (Kalichman et al. 2007) . A qualitative study of bar and shebeen patrons in an urban South African setting in Gauteng Province by Morojele et al. (2006) recorded the attitudes and behaviours of drinkers and smokers in taverns and township shebeens, the licensed and unlicensed premises where liquor is sold. Fieldworkers observed that many casual sexual encounters occurred while men were drinking. Cross-generational relations between older men, so-called 'sugar daddies', and younger women were common in that setting. However, heavy drinking seemed to exacerbate rather than cause the sexual risk behaviours in question (Morojele et al. 2006) .",

A unique feature of the pilot study was that the facilitators were instructed to avoid explicit mention of AIDS and stigma. Nonetheless, participants in each focus group spontaneously identified stigma as a factor that discouraged individuals to present for and complete treatment. The study found that the stigma associated with TB had come full circle in the Eastern Cape. Apparently, TB was stigmatised in the past when it was known mainly as an incurable 'Xhosa disease'. TB lost its stigma when a cure was found, only later to be re-stigmatised as a marker of AIDS in what the literature calls the 'new' epidemic. Uncertainty surrounding the diagnosis and cure of TB for persons co-infected with HIV contributed to prejudice. By consensus, AIDS was characterised as a 'killer' disease. In line with public health messages, TB was projected as a curable and therefore less serious disease if the prescribed course of treatment was completed (M\u00f8ller and Erstad 2007) . Although most discussants thought anyone could be infected with TB, there was consensus that people who drink and smoke were more at risk than others. TB was regarded as self-inflicted in the case of drinkers and smokers. The resurgence of TB in the province was often linked to human failure: ''If precautions are adhered to, TB would be curable''. ''It's good behaviour, taking care of ourselves. Because if people were to take care and behave, the [number of] cases would have dropped by now''. A common perception was that the disease could be fatal in the case of patients not 'following instructions' when undergoing TB treatment and 'enjoying life', meaning that they engaged in irresponsible behaviour such as excessive drinking and smoking. ''The treatment doesn't go well with drinking'' declared the out-of-school youth. Non-compliant cases were almost always discussed in terms of what the disease stigma literature calls the immoral 'other' category. The out-ofschool youth associated alcohol with TB and repeat infections. ''He liked drinking a lot and so TB attacked him again. Most of the people that I see with TB are the ones that like drinking a lot''. Similarly, the health workers also linked smoking and drinking to health relapses: ''Some resort to bad behaviours of drinking and smoking after completing treatment''. Apparently, according to the health workers, it was more difficult to get men to take the TB test. ''They are very much anti-clinic because they have fears that they smoke and this might be linked to TB''. Male participants confirmed their reluctance to visit health clinics where they were reprimanded by health workers: ''We liquor drinkers are spoken badly to in front of everyone''.",

At the beginning of the interview, respondents were asked to identify the characteristics of people most at risk of TB. The item aimed to explore whether layers of stigma might be associated with TB. Sixteen response options were offered from which respondents could choose four (Table 1) . Options included both social and environmental factors considered to be relevant in a high TB prevalence setting: HIV-co-infection, poverty, overcrowded living conditions, low social status indicated by lack of education and employment, and a tainted character or lack of social respectability indicated by non-conformist or socially discredited behaviour such as laziness, promiscuity, not going to church regularly, frequenting shebeens, and excessive drinking and smoking. Table 1 shows that over four rounds of responses, the highest proportion of respondents identified people who 'drink and smoke a lot' to be at the greatest risk of TB. With 71%, the 'drink/smoke' option was endorsed by far the highest proportion of voters, followed by exposure to dust (59%), HIV-positive status (50%), and poor living conditions (48 and 34%, respectively).

The focus-group results described the 'irresponsible', non-compliant TB patient as one who drinks and smokes. In the community survey, the association of TB with drinking and smoking seems to epitomise moral deficiency. Judging from the results of the regression analysis, 'drinking and smoking a lot' is more often associated with TB by churchgoers-possible representatives of the moral majority (see Lichtenstein 2008)than by treatment supervisors.

Drinking, Smoking, and Morality 231 The above findings suggested that 'drinkers and smokers' might constitute a stereotype, a form of 'othering' as described in the literature on stigma, that serves to distance the community from contamination with moral pollution and a health threat. The pilot study that informed the sample survey had already suggested that drinkers and smokers might belong to a maligned or marked group akin to the scapegoat that is burdened with the ill in society. A second set of follow-up focus-group discussions was conducted to shed more light on this idea.",

The follow-up focus-group study suggests this is the case. Discussants vacillated between describing smokers and drinkers as different or as 'one of us'. There was no consensus among focus-group discussants on whether drinkers and smokers who contracted TB or HIV were blameless victims of poverty (Farmer 1996; Erstad 2006) or had chosen a risky lifestyle of their own free will. The youth made a distinction between 'fun' drinkers and 'stress' drinkers, who drank to forget their problems. The semantic differential outcome suggested that drinking and smoking, including 'stress' drinking, is not exclusive to the poor and unemployed; drinkers and smokers included a mix of generations and social strata. The churchgoing discussants tended to regard drinkers and smokers as lapsed Christians. Drinkers and smokers were often portrayed as having strayed from the exemplary moral behaviour prescribed by the church. According to our discussants, the local churches condemned drinking and smoking but extended charity to drinkers and smokers in the hope of winning 'sinners' back to the fold. However, it was considered unlikely that drinkers would change their lifestyle, even with the support of others.",

If the church and the shebeen represent the sacred and secular poles of township morality, the two institutions also share a number of commonalities. Historically, the African churches and the township shebeen share a proud track record of defiance. The older generation of charismatic churches of Africa were established as independent centres of worship (Centre for Enterprise and Development 2008). It is telling that many go by the name of 'Ethiopian' 6 -the only African country that never experienced colonial rule. With reference to shebeens, Parry (2005: 426) notes that the growth of illegal liquor outlets in the second half of the twentieth century served as a form of resistance to apartheid policies instituted to repress the black majority, as did the destruction of the government-run beerhalls in the 1970s. Both church and shebeen offer fellowship and refuge to people experiencing personal and social problems. Hymn-singing and alcohol have the power to transport to another sphere where everyday anxieties fall away.

Township folk are offered only two choices on how to conduct their lives: you either drink and smoke or you abstain, there 4 Grahamstown has 52 churches of numerous denominations, gaining it the nickname of City of Saints. 5 Personal communication, crime intelligence official, South African Police Service (SAPS), Grahamstown, 17 June 2009. 6 Three churchgoers among the follow-up focus-group discussants identified their denominations as Ethiopian. Drinking, Smoking, and Morality 233 is no in-between. 7 According to this belief, the church represents salvation; the shebeen the work of the devil. Drinkers must be saved from damnation. Clues to why drinkers and smokers are maligned in a society that knows no moderation in its drinking habits, is provided by Steinberg's (2008) insightful inquiry into resistance to HIV testing in Eastern Cape villages. His research found that church people recommended a cleansing process, that involves abstaining from drinking and smoking, to attain purity in body and soul, and to redeem society from ill in the time of HIV/AIDS. Steinberg was puzzled that a self-appointed HIV-counsellor, a devout Christian, who accompanied many of the people in her village to the health clinic to check their status, advised her charges to quit drinking and smoking before going on antiretroviral (ARV) treatment (2008: 167-181). Steinberg established that there was no sound medical motivation to prohibit all ARV users from drinking. Although drinking while on medication for chronic illness was undoubtedly unadvisable, it did not impede the drug's work nor aggravate the side effects (Steinberg 2008:180) . One of the medical experts Steinberg consulted on the origin of the injunction against drinking and smoking for patients on antiretroviral treatment, spoke of a prejudice against drinkers. He intimated that AIDS counsellors were creating an exclusive church (sic) around ARVs that excluded many, particularly unemployed men, from benefiting from ARV treatment. According to the medical expert, ''it is important for people to believe they are part of a club, perhaps even a church. It is a sense of ubuntu. 8 If you want to create a club, you must create rules'' (cited in Steinberg 2008:181, first emphasis added). Steinberg speculates about the significance of these rules. Apparently, it is an article of faith among many South Africans that those who smoke or drink while taking ARVs will die. He reasons that to belong to the 'church' created by the treatment campaigners one ''must submit one's powers of discipline and restraint to the public test'' (Steinberg 2008:181) . Thus treatment is a redemption of sorts as is ''cleansing your contaminated body of smoke and drink'' (Steinberg 2008:182) . The sharp accusation of those who drank and smoked while on ARV treatment is akin to announcing that they died of contamination. Steinberg notes that ''perhaps it is hard to cleanse and to heal in the absence of an enemy or a scapegoat''. (Steinberg 2008:182, emphasis added) .",

It is possible that the drinker and smoker stereotype is a product of the South African social setting in which poverty and discrimination has driven the politically and economically oppressed to find solace and an independence of spirit in either the church or the shebeen. It is therefore recommended that further research be conducted in a range of settings using the bio-medical or sociological approach or a combination of both.",
