Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is known to be the most common cause of severe lower respiratory infections (LRI) in infants in the first year of life. RSV infection is more severe than influenza infection in infants resulting in high rate of hospitalization 1, 2 . However, for more common but less severe upper respiratory tract infection (URI), there has been less information on the spectrum of causative viruses in young infants. Availability of molecular techniques has increased the sensitivity of viral diagnostic testing and allows studying of broad spectrum of viruses including relatively new viruses. Recent published studies on birth cohorts followed longitudinally for acute respiratory symptoms have come from Europe and Australia 3,4,5 but not the United States. Further understanding of viral epidemiology of respiratory infections will be the basis of development of new interventions for treatment and prevention of infections in this vulnerable population.",

The subjects were evaluated as soon as possible after URI onset and followed for AOM complication. At the initial URI visit, otoscopic examination and tympanometry were performed and nasopharyngeal specimens were collected for bacterial and viral studies; a follow-up visit was provided a few days later. Telephone calls were made weekly for follow-up of possible AOM symptoms within 4 weeks after URI onset. Parents were encouraged to bring the subject for examination by the study group anytime they suspected the infant might have an ear infection. AOM diagnosis was made based on presentations of acute symptoms (fever, irritability, otalgia), signs of tympanic membrane inflammation (intense redness, bulging, opaque tympanic membrane) and presence of middle ear fluid as documented by pneumatic otoscopy and/or tympanometry.",

The spectrum of viruses affecting our infants did not change throughout the 31-month pre-, during and postpandemic periods. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the impact of the influenza pandemic on changes in viral epidemiology of both URI and LRI among healthy infants in the first year of life in the United States. The data do not support our original hypothesis on the effect of the pandemic on viral epidemiology of respiratory infections in this age group.

The sensitive molecular diagnostic methods, therefore, contribute to detection of multiple viruses, including the pathogen as well as persistent viruses.

Third, the use of influenza vaccines, both pandemic and seasonal in our population may help protect the infants although only about half of our eligible infants were vaccinated. Lastly, maternal immunity and immunization may have also played a role in protection of these infants. Our findings on low impact of the pandemic on our infants are supported by results from a recent study from the United Kingdom; in a cohort of 150 prematurely born infants followed longitudinally, hospitalization rate for pandemic influenza was low and similar to that of term-born infants in the same geographic area 2 . Influenza activities in Galveston area always mirror those in Houston and the state of Texas. Our initial peak of the influenza pandemic was in May and June and a second peak was between September and November, 2009. Our increased research visits coincided with the community peaks.

Therefore, we could not accurately calculate the incidence of URI and LRI in the entire first year of life. Furthermore, while we relied on parent reports of the respiratory symptoms, bi-weekly telephone interview, monthly home visits and comprehensive chart review; milder cold symptoms may have been missed. This may explain why during the pandemic, with more awareness and concern of parents, there was a surge in parent-initiated visits due to respiratory symptoms, even if mild. Another limitation was that only about half of documented URI episodes, with or without LRI were studied for viruses. We have shown, however, that the URI episodes with study samples paralleled in time with the episodes without study samples.
