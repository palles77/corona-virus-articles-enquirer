            "text": "Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved transport pathway required for the degradation of long-lived proteins and organelles and thus is essential for the maintenance of cell homeostasis (Levine and Klionsky, 2004; Shintani and Klionsky, 2004; Mizushima et al., 2008) . Autophagy is characterized by the formation of double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes that sequester cytoplasmic components and deliver them into lysosomes (Levine and Klionsky, 2004; Kawamata et al., 2008) . Autophagy is active at basal level in every eukaryotic cell and can be enhanced by several cellular stresses, including nutrient starvation (Kroemer et al., 2010) or pathogen invasions (Levine et al., 2011) . Autophagosome biogenesis is orchestrated by the autophagyrelated (ATG) proteins, which have been subdivided in functional clusters of genes mainly based on physical interactions (He and Klionsky, 2009) . One of them is the ULK complex, which consists of the ULK1 (or ULK2) kinase, ATG13, FIP200, and ATG101, and it is at the terminus of several signaling cascades that positively or negatively regulate autophagy (Wong et al., 2013) . Stimulation of ULK1 activity initiates the assembly of the autophagy machinery at the site where autophagosomes will emerge, which is often in close proximity of the ER (Axe et al., 2008) . This assembly involves the recruitment of additional functional clusters of proteins, including ATG9A and an autophagy-specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex class III (Yang and Klionsky, 2010) , that generates phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate on autophagosomal membranes, promoting the Autophagy is a catabolic process regulated by the orchestrated action of the autophagy-related (ATG) proteins. Recent work indicates that some of the ATG proteins also have autophagy-independent roles. Using an unbiased siRNA screen approach, we explored the extent of these unconventional functions of ATG proteins. We determined the effects of the depletion of each ATG proteome component on the replication of six different viruses. Our screen reveals that up to 36% of the ATG proteins significantly alter the replication of at least one virus in an unconventional fashion. Detailed analysis of two candidates revealed an undocumented role for ATG13 and FIP200 in picornavirus replication that is independent of their function in autophagy as part of the ULK complex. The high numbers of unveiled ATG gene-specific and pathogenspecific functions of the ATG proteins calls for caution in the interpretation of data, which rely solely on the depletion of a single ATG protein to specifically ablate autophagy.",

Although a block of autophagy was not altering virus replication in most of the tested infections, a considerable number of single protein depletions inhibited or enhanced the replication of one or more viruses. As a proof of principle, we examined the role of ATG13 and FIP200 in picornaviral infection and demonstrated that these proteins control the replication of members of this virus family outside the context of the ULK complex. Moreover RNA-sequencing analyses highlighted potential proteins and cellular pathways through which ATG13 and FIP200 could influence picornaviral infection independently of autophagy. Altogether, our results reveal that an unpredicted large number of ATG genes have an unconventional function and therefore strongly challenge the current notion that depletion of an ATG gene leads principally to a specific block of autophagy.",

To avoid cell-specific functions, which could explain some of the inconsistent results in the literature Chakrabarti et al., 2012; Tabor-Godwin et al., 2012) , and focus on key proteins relevant to the virus life cycle in all cell types, we performed the siRNA screen in two cell lines: HeLa and U2OS cells. We chose HeLa and U2OS cells because they originate from diverse tissues, i.e., cervix and bone tissue, respectively (Scheffner et al., 1991; Landers et al., 1997) . For the whole screen, we used HeLa cells expressing the mCeaCam1 surface protein, which is required to allow efficient infection by MHV . For the same reason, HEK293T cells expressing mCeaCam1 were used instead of U2OS cells as the second cell line for the screen with MHV.",

We found that the number of p62 puncta per cell was increased in the majority of the ATG-depleted cells in both HeLa and U2OS cell lines ( Fig. 1 B and Table S5 ), indicating that autophagic degradation is blocked. ATG7 and ULK1 depletions were among the strongest increasers of p62 puncta , whereas p62 depletion led to a decrease in p62 puncta per cell. To reinforce this finding, we also measured endogenous LC3 puncta number and area ( Fig. 1 D and Fig. S1 A; Klionsky et al., 2016) . Consistently with the literature, these analyses revealed two populations of ATG proteins that upon deletion lead to either a reduction or increase of LC3 puncta formation ( Fig. 1 D, Fig. S1 A, and Table S5 ). Proteins such as ATG5, ATG12, or WIPI2 that are known to be involved in LC3 recruitment onto autophagosomal membranes reduce LC3 puncta formation (Mizushima et al., 2001; Polson et al., 2010) . Conversely, we found an increase in LC3 puncta number in cells lacking proteins like WIPI4 and ATG2 that lead to an accumulation of autophagosomal intermediates positive for LC3 (Lu et al., 2011; Velikkakath et al., 2012) . Altogether, these verification experiments confirmed that our siRNA library and the used screening protocol are effective in blocking the autophagy function of the targeted genes in both cell lines.",

In contrast to the autophagy measurement in which an accumulation of p62 puncta was detected in the large majority of the samples (Fig. 1, B and D; and Table S5 ), we did not observe a uniform redistribution of the changes in replication in both tested cell lines in any of the examined viruses (Fig. S1 B and Fig. S2 ), even if HSV-1 replication was to some extent reduced in 75% of the tested ATG protein knockdown cells. Our data in particular showed that autophagy does not play a role in either inhibiting or promoting the replication of EMCV, IAV, and MHV (Figs. 1 D, S1 B, and S2). The results for VaV and SFV, however, differed from the ones obtained with the other viruses. We observed an almost uniform increase in viral replication upon ATG gene depletion in HeLa cells, suggesting a possible function of autophagy in repressing VaV and SFV infection. In contrast, VaV and SFV replication was almost uniformly decreased upon ATG gene knockdown in U2OS cells, indicating a beneficial role of autophagy. The prominent cell-specific differences in the VaV and SFV replication-autophagy interaction could explain some of the discrepancies in the literature about the role of autophagy in specific types of infections and highlight the importance of using more than one cell line when studying this relationship.",

Unlike the other ULK complex components, its depletion caused a significant increase in EMCV replication (Fig. 1, C and D) . We first determined the efficiency of ATG13 knockdown at the mRNA and protein level by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. ATG13 was completely depleted from cells by at least three out of four single siRNA probes composing the pool used in the screen (Fig. S3 , A and B; and Table S3 ). We then reassessed the replication of the studied virus in both U2OS and HeLa cells with the siRNA that was very efficiently depleting ATG13 (i.e., probe 4) to exclude possible off-target effects of a mixture of probes. We also included another member of the picornavirus family, coxsackievirus B3 (CV; member of the Enterovirus B species), which has a pathological impact on human health (Muehlenbachs et al., 2015) . In agreement with the screen results ( Fig. 1) , replication of HSV-1, IAV, VaV, and SFV were not affected by ATG13 depletion, whereas EMCV was enhanced ( Fig. S4 ). Interestingly CV replication was significantly augmented in both cell lines upon ATG13 depletion (Fig. S4 ). Enhanced CV and EMCV replication was confirmed in immortalized ATG13 \u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) complemented or not with a plasmid carrying ATG13 (Hieke et al., 2015; Fig. 2 , A-C). We also measured an increase in IAV replication in ATG13 \u2212/\u2212 MEFs, but this is very likely a cell line-specific effect, because it was not observed in U2OS or HeLa cells (Fig. 2 A) .",

Z-scores of p62 puncta measurements are presented in a scatterplot, where the data obtained in HeLa cells are ranked on the x axis and those acquired in U2OS cells are on the y axis. (C) The combined Z-scores of viral replication measurements (y axis) for all viruses and cell lines are plotted on a single graph. The dotted black lines indicate the location of the measurements that are significantly different in comparison to the control. Arrows highlight the results for two examples of genes known to be essential for virus replication (ATP6V1A for IAV and PI4KA for EMCV) and ATG13, a newly found replication suppressor for EMCV. (D) Heatmap of the siRNA screen where the combined Z-scores of both cell lines for the viral replication and p62 puncta measurement are indicated as well as the Z-scores for LC3 puncta in U2OS cells. Red indicates an enhancement in viral replication, p62, or LC3 accumulation in puncta, whereas blue underlines inhibition of viral replication or a decrease in the number of p62-or LC3-positive puncta (n = 4 for viral infection and LC3 puncta assessment; n = 3 for p62 puncta quantification). whether, as indicated by the screen results ( Fig. 1) , the rest of the subunits do not affect the replication of EMCV and CV. We first selected single siRNAs that were efficiently knocking down ULK1, ULK2, FIP200, and ATG101 and ATG7, a key autophagy protein (Mizushima et al., 1998) that is not part of the ULK complex by quantitative real-time PCR and/or Western blot (Fig. S3 ). This examination revealed that the levels of these proteins were reduced to a similar extent in both tested cell lines. However, we observed differences in the knockdown efficiency in the tested cell lines when analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR in samples treated with the siRNA pool targeting FIP200. This difference in knockdown efficiency within cell lines might also add to the variation in virus replication observed in the screen for some genes. As documented previously (Mizushima et al., 1998; Chan et al., 2007; Hara et al., 2008; Hosokawa et al., 2009; Jung et al., 2009; Ro et al., 2013) , depletion of these proteins blocked autophagy. We measured the autophagic flux block using the long-lived protein degradation assay and accumulation of endogenous p62 puncta (Fig. 3) . This result proved that all used single siRNAs effectively block the canonical function of the targeted proteins in autophagy under the knockdown conditions used to test viral replications.",

We also confirmed that knockdown of the ULK complex components had no effect on EMCV and CV replication, with the exception of FIP200 (Fig. 4, and Fig. 5 , A and C), which already displayed higher, but not significant, EMCV replication in the screen (Fig. 1 D; see Table S5 ). We also corroborated these results in HEK293T cells in which the knockdown of ATG13 and FIP200 enhanced the number of CV infected cells whereas that of ATG7 did not (Fig. 6 , A and B). Furthermore, overexpression of ATG13 or FIP200 in doxycycline-inducible stable HEK293T cells (Fig. 6 , F, G, I, and J) reduced the number of CV-infected cells. Although nutrient starvation increased phosphorylation of ATG13 by ULK1, which elicits autophagy stimulation (Hieke et al., 2015) , there were no changes in ATG13 phosphorylation upon infection with EMCV or CV (Fig. 4 G) . The notion that the ULK complex is not activated during EMCV and CV infection was reinforced by analyzing the activity of mTORC1 using S6 protein phosphorylation as the readout (Wong et al., 2013; Fig. 4 H) . Importantly, EMCV and CV infections in the presence or absence of ATG13 did not influence mTORC1 activity (Fig. 4 H) . Altogether, these results demonstrate that ATG13 and FIP200 are involved in the control of EMCV and CV replication, whereas the ULK complex, and generally autophagy, are not required for this function. retrovirally transformed with either an empty vector or one expressing HA-ATG13 were infected with the indicated luciferase expressing viruses for 6 h before measuring luciferase expression (n = 4). (B) ATG13 \u2212/\u2212 MEFs retrovirally transformed with either an empty vector or one carrying HA-ATG13 were infected with EMCV or CV, cells were stained using antibodies against viral proteins, and the number of infected cells was determined by automated counting of immunofluorescence images (n = 3). (C) ATG13 \u2212/\u2212 MEFs retrovirally transformed with either an empty vector or one expressing HA-ATG13 were infected with luciferase-expressing EMCV or CV for 2, 4, 6, and 8 h before measuring luciferase expression (n = 6 for EMCV and n = 8 for CV). (D) EMCV and CV titer was determined in ATG13 \u2212/\u2212 MEFs retrovirally transformed with either an empty vector or one expressing HA-ATG13 using the tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) assay (n = 3).

Picornaviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses, and their replication within the cell starts from their genomic viral RNA (Baron and Baltimore, 1982) . Depletion of ATG13 significantly increased EMCV and CV replication from their transfected viral RNA compared with the control (Fig. 7 , A and C), indicating that it is unlikely that ATG13 has a role in virus entry. Upon specific inhibition of EMCV and CV genomic RNA replication with GPC-N114 (van der Linden et al., 2015) and guanidine hydrochloride (De Palma et al., 2008) , respectively, no difference in luciferase levels was observed, indicating that depletion of ATG13 does not affect viral RNA translation. To further rule out that ATG13 depletion modifies internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent (Muthukrishnan et al., 1975) or cap-dependent translation (Pelletier and Sonenberg, 1988 ), we measured IRES-and cap-dependent luciferase-based reporter activity in control and ATG13-depleted cells (Fig. 7 , E and F). We did not observe a general enhancement of cap-dependent protein translation or IRES-mediated translation upon ATG13 depletion (Fig. 7 , E and F). We thus concluded that ATG13, and by extension FIP200, are directly involved in EMCV and CV genome replication.",

As expected, ATG13 and FIP200 were binding the other subunits of the ULK complex (Behrends et al., 2010) in infected and uninfected cells, as well as known interactors such as ATG9A (Suzuki et al., 2015b) and components of the C9orf72-SMCR8-WDR41 complex recently found to regulate autophagy (Sullivan et al., 2016; Fig. S4 F) . Importantly, we did not find an interaction between either ATG13 or FIP200 with any of the CV proteins, or main changes in the interactome of ATG13 and FIP200, upon infection ( Fig. S4 F and Table S6 ). In addition, a distribution analysis of ATG13 and FIP200 during CV and EMCV infection in U2OS cells by immunofluorescence showed no colocalization between these two proteins with the viral replication complexes (unpublished data). Furthermore, depletion of ATG13, FIP200, or ATG7 did not change the localization of either EMCV or CV replication complexes compared with the control cells (Fig. S5, A-D) . We also did not observe differences in the morphology of the CV replication structures upon ATG13 depletion compared with the control by electron microscopy (Fig. S5, F and G) . This type of analysis, however, showed that there are more cells displaying typical CV replication structures, which appear late in CV life cycle (Fig. S5 E, category 1; Limpens et al., 2011) , confirming the finding that ATG13 depletion accelerates the infection by this virus (Fig. S5 E) . Altogether, these results strongly suggest that ATG13 and FIP200 regulate picornavirus replication through a process that does not directly interfere with viral components.",

To identify genes and pathways that are differentially regulated in ATG13 and FIP200 knockdown cells, but not in those depleted of ATG7, we extracted the genes that were differentially expressed in ATG13-and FIP200depleted cells compared with control cells and furthermore did not display expression changes in the absence of ATG7. We categorized these genes as up-regulated and down-regulated, separating uninfected and CV-infected cells (Fig. 10 A) . The RNA-sequencing analysis revealed, in uninfected cells, that 83 genes were up-regulated and 142 down-regulated by ATG13 and FIP200 depletion in an autophagy-independent manner. In CV-infected cells, we identified 32 up-regulated and 36 down-regulated genes (Fig. 10 A) . Most of the identified genes are involved in transcriptional regulation, transport, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and ubiquitin conjugation (Fig. 10 B) . Accordingly, Gene Ontology analysis showed that most of the genes localized to the nucleus and the cytoplasm, but others also localized to endomembranes such as the ER and mitochondria. In line with our data (Figs. S4 and S5), we did not observe an enrichment of genes involved in the antiviral IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response in CV-infected cells. Collectively, our RNA-sequencing results point to several processes involving ATG13 and FIP200 outside the context of autophagy, and one or more of them might play a role controlling picornavirus infection.",

To investigate the contribution and relevance of this process in specific situations, one of the most frequently used approaches has been and still is the depletion of ATG proteins. Large parts of the studies rely on the ablation of only one ATG protein, which is sufficient to inhibit autophagy. An emerging number of studies, however, are revealing that ATG proteins have also functions that are not related to their role in autophagy (Bestebroer et al., 2013; Subramani and Malhotra, 2013) . As a result, it could be that some of the processes that have been associated with autophagy are not linked with this pathway but simply connected with one or more of these unconventional functions of the ATG proteins, as recently shown for neutrophil-mediated immunopathology during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Here, ATG5 has a unique autophagy-independent role in protection against the pathogen and not as previously assumed as partof the autophagy machinery (Kimmey et al., 2015) . Similarly, ATG12 has a potentially distinct function from autophagy in pro-opiomelanocortin-expressing neurons because, in contrast to that of ATG5, its specific deletion in these cells causes an acceleration in weight gain upon a high-fat diet and disrupts the energy balance in mice (Malhotra et al., 2015) . These studies clearly show that key ATG genes such as ATG5 and ATG12 fulfill unconventional functions beyond autophagy. Furthermore, there are also unconventional functions of ATG proteins in the complexes involved in autophagy initiation such as ULK1/2, which, for example, functions in ER-to-Golgi trafficking (Joo et al., 2016) .",

We performed our screen in two different cell lines to exclude cell line-specific functions. The importance of this approach is reflected by the results we obtained with VaV and SFV. We observed clear opposite effects on VaV and SFV replication upon ATG proteome depletion depending on the cell line. This result could explain some of the discrepancies in the literature, such as the one for EMCV in which depletion of autophagy genes in different cell lines was either beneficial or unfavorable for the virus Chakrabarti et al., 2012) .",

In contrast, we have found that 16 out of 44 tested ATG proteins (36%) might have unconventional functions, and this number increases to 20 out of 44 ATG proteins (45%) if we also include those ATG proteins that are exclusively found to be relevant for HSV-1 replication.

Very little is known about the involvement of autophagy in the SFV and VaV life cycles. Although it seems that, upon SFV infection, there is an accumulation of autophagosomes caused by a block in this pathway, the virus titer is unchanged in ATG5 \u2212/\u2212 MEFs (Eng et al., 2012) . VaV appears to block autophagosome formation upon infection, but in this case, the virus titer is unaffected in ATG3 \u2212/\u2212 and ATG5 \u2212/\u2212 MEFs or BEC LIN1 \u2212/\u2212 embryonic stem cells (Zhang et al., 2006; Moloughney et al., 2011) .

            "text": "To validate our screening approach and identify unconventional functions of ATG proteins, we focused on ATG13, because its depletion markedly enhanced EMCV replication, whereas knockdown of other ULK complex components (such as ULK1, ULK2, or ATG101) did not. A detailed analysis confirmed that not only ATG13 but also FIP200 decrease EMCV replication independently of their function in autophagy (Fig. 10 C) . Although FIP200 was not among the significant hits in the screen, EMCV replication was strongly up-regulated upon its depletion. In contrast to what was found for UVR AG during IAV infection (Pirooz et al., 2014) , ATG13 and FIP200, possibly in complex, control not virus cell entry but rather virus replication. Interestingly, the unconventional function of ATG13 and FIP200 is not restricted to EMCV but also controls more members of the picornavirus family, i.e., CVB3, CVA21, and EV71. It has been shown that picornaviruses induce autophagy upon infection, and this is beneficial for both enterovirus 71 (Huang et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2014; Fu et al., 2015) and CV (Wong et al., 2008; Kemball et al., 2010; Alirezaei et al., 2012 Alirezaei et al., , 2015 Tabor-Godwin et al., 2012) , whereas it is still a matter of debate whether autophagy has also a proviral role for EMCV Chakrabarti et al., 2012) . Based on the conclusions of these studies, one would expect that depletion of any ATG protein that blocks autophagy should inhibit the picornavirus life cycle as well. Although we blocked autophagy by ATG13 and FIP200 depletion, we did not observe impairment in picornaviral life cycles. On the contrary, viral replication and subsequent viral particle production were strongly enhanced in the absence of these two proteins, even in cells where ATG7 was simultaneously depleted. It has previously been indicated that autophagy is essential for picornavirus infections mostly through the use of pharmacological autophagy inhibitors but also through BEC LIN1, VPS34, LC3, and ATG7 knockdown (Wong et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2011; Delorme-Axford et al., 2014) . Pharmacological inhibitors or BEC LIN1 and VPS34 depletion affects specific endosomal functions, and this could also have an impact on picornaviral infections, depending on the cell type. We confirmed, to a certain extent, the inhibitory effect of ATG7 knockdown (Figs. 4, 5, 7, and 8) , which would suggest that this protein, like ATG13 and FIP200, influences picornavirus infection through an unconventional role in a different pathway. Alternatively, the fact that picornaviruses can exploit more than one pathway for replication, including autophagy (Alirezaei et al., 2015) , could explain the relevance of ATG proteins in specific cell types, as was shown for pancreatic acinar cells, in which ATG5 deletion reduces CV replication as well as pathogenesis (Alirezaei et al., 2012) .",

The overlapping areas indicate genes that are differentially expressed in both ATG13-and FIP200-depleted cells. Genes whose transcription is also altered in ATG7depleted cells were not considered, because their differential expression is very likely linked to one or more functions of autophagy.
