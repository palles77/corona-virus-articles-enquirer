Several dozen new antibodies are currently undergoing different stages of clinical trials, and some of them will soon be added to the list of immunotherapeutic drugs. Most of these antibodies have been generated using hybridoma technology or a phage display. In recent years, new methods of obtaining human monoclonal antibodies have been actively developing. These methods rely on sequencing immunoglobulin genes from B lymphocytes, as well as on the creation of antibody-secreting stable B-cell lines. The term next-generation antibody-discovery platforms has already been established in the literature to refer to these approaches. Our review focuses on describing the results obtained by these methods.",

With the development of transgenic mouse strains carrying human immunoglobulin genes [2] , it became possible to obtain purely human antibodies. Despite being a rather old invention, the hybridoma technique remains the principal method of mAb production. However, this method has certain important shortcomings, the most significant of which is the low probability of hybridization between partner cells (10 \u22124 to 10 \u22125 ). As a result, the efficiency of obtaining hybridomas for weakly immunogenic proteins is poor. In addition, the use of transgenic mice carrying Ig genes is subject to strict regulation and rather expensive.",

They are based on the analysis of vast Ig gene libraries. The most popular technique, phage display, has already been successfully employed to obtain several mAbs used in clinical immunotherapy, in particular, adalimumab, which inhibits the binding of tumor necrosis factor to its receptor [3] . However, compared to the hybridoma technology, this approach has been just moderately successful. The principal shortcoming of the combinatorial methods is that the resulting antibodies do not undergo selection in vivo. Furthermore, this method frequently generates antibodies with nonphysiological pairing of Ig chains, i.e., a pairing that never occurs in natural immune response. From this point of view, agents obtained using combinatorial techniques can be considered as antibody mimetics, which are likely to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies in patients during long-term administration [4, 5] .",

After the corresponding Ig genes were sequenced and expressed, it was found that the immune response was mediated by at least 50 independent clones that targeted different regions of gp120.

B cells of volunteer donors vaccinated against influenza virus were sorted into plate wells, one cell per well. During reverse transcription, cDNA was labeled with bar code sequences specific to each well. Following PCR, specimens were combined and analyzed using NGS. Those VH and VL sequences that carried the same bar code corresponded to the physiologically correct pairing of the light and the heavy Ig chain. mAbs against influenza virus antigens were obtained based on the expression of the most frequently occurring physiological pairs of Ig gene sequences. A more sophisticated approach was employed by DeKosky et al. [28] , who used the so-called paired VH-VL analysis. Blood B cells were sorted by one per well using flow cytometry. Each well also contained paramagnetic particles carrying poly(dT) molecules for mRNA binding. Following cell lysis, particles from different wells were combined, and emulsion RT-PCR was performed so as to amplify cDNA from each particle in an individual drop of emulsion. Amplification was performed with overlapping primers in order to obtain a single PCR product containing gene sequences for the heavy and light Ig chains fused via a short linker. In this way, it was possible to detect the expression of Ig genes of antibodies broadly presented in the immunological repertoire, as well as those that correspond to rare B-cell clones. If the sequence data obtained by NGS overlap insufficiently, mass spectrometry-based proteomic methods can be additionally employed to determine amino acid sequences of variable Ig domains [29, 30] .",
