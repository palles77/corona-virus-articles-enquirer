A binding domain that mediates the attachment of the virus to its receptor has been identified in the S1 protein of prototype IBV strain M41. In this study, we identified this binding domain in a different strain, as well as the cellular proteins that interact with it. First, we expressed the S1 N proteins (residues 19-270) of M41 and another isolate, SCZJ3, and compared the binding capacities of recombinant S1 N -M41 and S1 N -SCZJ3 to host tissues. Protein histochemistry showed that both S1 N -M41 and S1 N -SCZJ3 could bind to lung and kidney, and that recombinant S1 N -SCZJ3 displayed a distinctive staining pattern in the proventriculus. Recombinant S1 N -SCZJ3 was then employed to purify binding-associated proteins in lung, kidney, and proventriculus. Using an affinity chromatography assay, two common bands of about 60 kDa and 70 kDa were obtained from the total tissue proteins. These protein bands were identified by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Finally, infection of chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells by SCZJ3 was found to be inhibited by anti-HSP70 but not anti-PDI polyclonal antibody. These data indicate that HSP70 is part of the receptor complex of IBV and might help to understand the mechanism of S-mediated cell entry of IBV.",

Certain residues in the RBD are critical for binding activity, and single mutations may abolish or change the binding activity of the virus [6] . In the case of IBV, the N-terminal portion of S1 (residues was mapped as the binding domain of the Mass type strain M41 [7] . However, the S1 subunit is highly variable, and mutations have been found in S1 of different genotypes [8] . These mutations may influence the binding activity of RBD to host tissues. Thus, we attempted to identify the receptor-binding domain of a different genotype. Z. Zhang and X. Yang contributed equally to the research.",

Sialic acid and heparan sulfate have been reported to be involved in IBV infection. Removal of sialic acid can abolish the binding of S1 to respiratory tissues [12, 13] . However, sialic acid is present on cells that are not sensitive to IBV, indicating that sialic acid is not the only molecule that binds to IBV [4] . Heparan sulfate was identified as a binding molecule only for the cell-adapted strain Beaudette, with the binding sites located within the S2 subunit (residues 686-691) [14] . Up to now, there has been little study of the protein involved in the binding process of IBV. In studies of SASR and 229E, RBDs showed specific binding to host receptors and showed higher binding activity than full-length S1 [15, 16] . This binding activity has been utilized to define the receptor of virus [17, 18] . In the present study, an affinity chromatography assay was used to isolate proteins that interacted with S1 N -SCZJ3 [19] . Using an infection inhibition assay, we found that HSP70 is part of the receptor complex of IBV.",

Distinctive binding of S1 N -SCZJ3 to mucous membrane epithelial cells was detected in the proventriculus (Phyre2).

However, the amino acid sequence from aa 19 to 36 is highly variable, and mutations may lead to conformational changes in S1 N -SCZJ3 to S1 N -M41. Two amino acid changes at the N-terminal spike protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus result in the loss of enteric tropism [25] . In the case of SARS coronavirus, the structure of the RBD has been analyzed. The receptor-binding motif (RBM) that makes contacts with ACE2 has been identified at residues 424 to 494, and mutations in the RBM are critical for affinity or infectivity [26] .

Surface-displayed HSP70 has been reported to be part of receptor complex in the case of dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus [17, 28] . HSP70 is a kind of stress protein that mainly induce ATP binding, and hydrolysis regulates its affinity for polypeptides. HSPs are important for folding of viral proteins [29] . b Fig. 2 (A) Isolation of S1 N -SCZJ3 binding-associated proteins by affinity chromatography. Total proteins of lung (L), kidney (K), and proventriculus (P) were incubated with S1 N -SCZJ3-coupled Ni-NTA resins. The chromatography eluates were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Four bands were obtained (as indicated) and identified as 14-3-3 protein (27 kDa), tropomyosin (45 kDa), protein-disulfide isomerase (60 kDa), and heat shock protein 70 (70 kDa) by LC-MS/ MS. (B) Blocking of binding by chromatography eluates. SCZJ3 (10 3 EID 50 ) was pre-incubated with affinity chromatography eluates of lung (L), kidney (K), proventriculus (P) and PBS as virus control (VC). Subsequently, CEK cells were infected with 1 ml of these preparations and the viral loads were determined by real-time PCR.",
