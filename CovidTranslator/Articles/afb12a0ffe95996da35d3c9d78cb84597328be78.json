            "text": "The eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) emerged from the United Nations (UN) Millennium Declaration in 2000, and are arguably the most politically important pact ever made for international development. 1 They identify specifi c development priorities across a very broad range, including poverty, education, gender, health, environment, and international partnerships. These goals have substantially shaped development dialogue and investment; some development agencies judge all their activities on the contribution to achievement of the MDGs. 2 Overall, progress towards the MDGs has been described as \"patchy\" 3 and \"uneven\". 4 The broad conclusion is that few goals are entirely on track globally, and those that are show substantial variation, with least progress in Africa and often south Asia. Whereas MDG 1 (eradication of extreme poverty and hunger) is on course to be achieved and \"remarkable improvements\" have been made regarding aspects of MDG 6 (combating of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases), insuffi cient progress has been made towards achievement of MDG 2 (provision of universal primary education), MDG 4 (reduction of child mortality), and MDG 5 (reduction of maternal mortality). 4, 5 Steps towards MDG 3 (promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women) have been labelled \"sluggish\"; \"alarmingly high\" rates of deforestation are hampering MDG 7 (ensuring of environmental sustainability); and Africa is \"short-changed\" by the aid fl ows included under MDG 8 (development of a global partnership for development). 4 Moreover, the global economic crisis has accentuated the urgency of the discussion, and progress is being jeopardised because of new fi nancial constraints. 6 As we approach the two-thirds mark for the achievement of these goals in 2015, attention is focused on acceleration of progress, and on whether these goals are the right model for international development after 2015. So far, analysis of the MDGs as models for international development has taken two forms. The fi rst involves sector-specifi c assessment of progress towards individual MDGs, largely by sectoral experts. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The second involves broader analysis of the MDGs as instruments of development, largely by international development specialists. 3, 12, 13 We believe that an understanding of the MDGs and future improvements in goal setting benefi ts from consideration of all goals together, because they are so interconnected and because their individual implementation has identifi ed many common issues. The purpose of this report is to identify challenges that have emerged in delivery of the MDGs that are common to diff erent goals and to suggest how future goal setting can be improved to avoid these diffi culties. We do not undertake to present a verdict on the MDGs, or a balanced assessment weighing advantages and disadvantages. We focus deliberately on problems with the MDGs to identify See Online for webappendix better future approaches. We will not propose specifi c changes in MDGs after 2015, but will suggest a set of principles that might guide future goal development. This Commission is intended for a broad readership interested in all MDGs and for a more health-focused readership, who we hope will gain an improved understanding of the important relations between health and other MDG targets.",

The Commission was codesigned with The Lancet, coordinated by LIDC, and prepared by experts in three LIDC member institutions: the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Institute of Education, and School of Oriental and African Studies, and their research partners in South Africa, Zambia, Malawi, India, and Thailand. This team brought specifi c, individual expertise with MDGs 1-7, from diff erent development perspectives and backgrounds. To build a team approach, each expert was asked with her or his partners to write a critique of their MDG and to contribute ideas arising from this analysis towards the design of future development goals. All participants read these papers as preparation for a 2-day facilitated workshop that identifi ed issues and challenges that cut across the MDGs and built a consensus about future development goal setting. During four subsequent, smaller workshops, this consensus was developed into a fi nal document. Although overseas partners could participate only in the fi rst main workshop, all contributed towards subsequent development and have made contributions to the fi nal version, including specifi c case studies.

They represent the latest eff ort in a long process of development goal setting which had antecedents in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Development Decade of the 1960s, and the many UN summits of the second half of the 20th century that set specifi c goals to reduce hunger, improve health, eradicate diseases, and school children. 14 The immediate antecedent of the MDGs was the Millennium Declaration, presented in 2000 at the UN Millennium Summit. 15 The Millennium Declaration presented six values that were considered to be fundamental to international relations in the 21st century: freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature, and shared responsibility. Seven key objectives were identifi ed to translate these shared values into actions: peace, security, and disarmament; development and poverty eradication; protection of our common environment; human rights, democracy, and good governance; protection of vulnerable people; meeting of the special needs of Africa; and strengthening of the UN. The second objective, development and poverty eradication, was translated into eleven resolutions, presented as development targets. Many of these targets had legacies that predated the Millennium Declaration and had arisen from sector-specifi c UN-sponsored and other world conferences and summits during the previous decades. Most had appeared as international development targets in the report of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Shaping the 21st century: the contribution of development cooperation. 16 The OECD's international development targets were particularly infl uential in the determination of the relevant text of the Millennium Declaration. With the addition of a few more targets, particularly for environmental sustainability, these became the MDGs. In turn these targets were linked post hoc with indicators, for the purposes of measurement, and with goals, for the purpose of conceptual simplicity. By 2001 the MDG framework comprised eight goals, 18 targets, and 48 indicators. 17 A few more targets and indicators were added later, creating the set presented in panel 1.",

Several recent analyses have provided a useful insight into how the MDGs represent an integration of diff erent international development strategies and initiatives emerging over recent decades. Hulme, 19 for instance, suggests that the MDGs developed through an interaction between, on the one hand, a US-led, neo-liberal ideology (one that promotes economic growth based on free trade and markets) linked to results-based management and, on the other hand, a development approach of some other wealthy countries, multilaterals, and non-governmental organisation (NGOs) that focused on multidimensional For more on the London International Development Centre see http://www.lidc. org.uk human development-eg, health, education, and gender equity, treating these as both development goals and development means. The emerging goals are biased towards a human development approach-\"fi ve and a half of the eight MDGs are about enhancing human capabilities\" 19 -and there is a strong emphasis on basic needs. However, they also incorporate neo-liberal thinking about economic growth into their important poverty goal (MDG 1), and their overall results-based framework focused greatly on international development partnerships. Manning 3 observes how the early neo-liberal leanings of the goals were tempered by recognition of the need for buy-in by developing countries and by NGOs, leading to the inclusion of goals more focused on human welfare and development, such as health and education.",

Gore 13 suggests that in tempering earlier neo-liberal approaches to development with human development objectives, the MDGs represent a switch from a \"procedural conception of international society\" to a \"purposive conception\". The former involves \"an association of States joined together through their common respect for a set of rules, norms and standard practices which govern the relationships between them\" whereas the latter involves \"an association of States joined together in a cooperative venture to promote common ends\". 13 With this target focus came an important shift from maximalist views of development (in which development involves poorer countries achieving aspirations of equality with richer countries) to minimalist standards (of proportions of people crossing poverty thresholds or accessing particular services or avoiding mortality or morbidity); and from societal and national change to changes for individuals within nation states. The emphasis on specifi c and minimalist targets, and the way in which it narrowed the development agenda and placed particular responsibilities on developing country governments, has generated many of the challenges facing implementation of the MDGs.",

For the most part, the MDGs constitute an assembly of often very narrowly focused and sector-specifi c development ideas and campaigns from the 1980s and 1990s. Their targets are often so narrow as to neglect important development issues in the same sector-eg, tertiary education, reproductive health, and a range of gender issues. At their conception, therefore, the MDGs were not a plan derived bottom-up from a broad, intersectoral conceptualisation of development and prioritisation of development needs, although superfi cially they might seem to have been. These summaries also show that progress has varied between goals and between targets. Although some goals were set up with a range of targets and indicators, subsequent attention and monitoring for any goal has usually focused on a subset of these targets and indicators, sometimes only one. This narrowing process could be an indication of diff erences in ease of target implementation and monitoring, and in the level of ownership by international and other institutions, with little ownership or overlap in ownership reducing progress. Generally, eff orts to improve MDGs by adding new targets at a later date have not been very successful, owing to the complexity of these targets and their indicators or to limited ownership, or both.",

In table 1 we show some diffi culties relating to conceptualisation and execution, drawn from our individual analyses of the MDGs presented in the webappendix. This list is illustrative and not meant to be comprehensive. Problems with the conceptualisation and execution of the MDGs arise at the goal, target, and indicator levels. This feature is shared by diff erent MDGs, and some goals have problems at more than one level. Broadly speaking, problems associated with the level of goals seem to relate to their being too narrow and fragmented, leaving gaps in which other important development objectives are missing. Problems at the target level often relate to their being incomplete or partial relative to the ambition of the goal, imprecise, or without a process of delivery. These problems tend to amplify the vertical nature of some goals, widening the gaps between them and reducing connectedness. Between 2005 and 2008, MDGs 1, 3, and 5 added targets aimed specifi cally at fi lling such gaps. Problems with indicators tend to be associated with measurement, ownership, or leadership. New indicators added during the course of the MDGs are especially prone to these problems.",

The elements taken into the MDGs were in fact the specifi c targets associated with only one objective of the Declaration, that of development and poverty eradication. Some of these goals, being themselves derived from specifi c targets, were very narrow in conception: education goals focused mainly on primary education, whereas health goals focused only on three aspects of health associated with maternal mortality, child mortality, and specifi c diseases. For goals that were more broadly defi ned, such as poverty reduction, gender, or environmental sustainability, the few targets assigned to them did not capture their breadth. The consequences of building goals around targets were two-fold. First, very substantial gaps existed in the coverage of goals, with targets failing to address important development needs for that sector.

Did this leave us unprepared for the food price crisis of 2007 and the need to make food security a global agenda? The focus of MDG 2 on primary education and enrolment has led in some countries to a so-called policy myopia, and a neglect of both learning level achievement and of secondary and post-secondary education, with important implications for economic growth. MDG 3's very narrow scope failed to capture several intrinsic women's rights issues such as freedom from violence and adult literacy, which are two areas of extreme inequality.

Although investment in vertical health programmes could bring resources, such as new health centres, that benefi t health systems overall, their focus on particular diseases means that other national needs might be unsupported. For example, a study in Mali found that a campaign to treat neglected tropical diseases disrupted basic health services at health centres because of staff absences; and in 14 of 16 health centres staff were overburdened by the additional requirements of the campaign. 35 Similarly, vertical programmes bring investment in accounting and procurement services that could strengthen national health systems generally, but which could in practice be limited to servicing specifi c disease programmes, running in parallel to weak national systems. In countries where human resources are scarce, such as most low-income countries, staff move to where salaries, incentives, and working conditions are best.

For example, the Mid-day Meal programme reaches 120 million primary school children every school day in India and provides a cooked meal. The introduction of this nutrition programme has greatly raised school attendance 43 and, in conjunction with agricultural services, can stimulate farm input and output markets and agricultural development. Environmental sustainability should be a cross-cutting goal with potentials for synergy across sectors. However, MDG 7 targets 7A and 7B are not expressed in a way that links them to human welfare and development, making such linkage diffi cult. This shortcoming could be addressed with the concept of ecosystem services, whose development in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment paralleled the implementation of the MDGs. The role of ecosystems services is refl ected in the need for sustainable provision of water, soil, and biodiversity services to support agriculture and achievement of MDG 1 targets, and the importance of environmental factors to improved health. For example, 24% of the global disease burden is estimated to be associated with environmental factors, and 25% of all deaths in developing countries are linked to environmental risks. 44 The fragmentation of the MDGs has probably resulted in several lost opportunities to improve development outcomes. At its heart, of course, is the longstanding fragmentation of most human knowledge and activity into so-called sectoral \"silos\"-such as health, education, environment, etc-and even into separate silos within sectors, as seen clearly with health targets spread across MDGs 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. At the intergovernmental and intragovernmental level, this isolation is reinforced by a long tradition of institutional ownership and disciplinary identities that are embedded in professional qualifi cation systems, societies, and journals. By simply gathering together established goals and targets of these diff erent development communities, the MDGs could not hope to achieve the desired integrated approach that is appropriate to complex problems in international development. Worse, by fostering traditional and institutional ownership of diff erent MDG goals, the MDGs reinforced their isolation.",

A focus on measurable MDG results does, however, mean that indicators are selected that capture neither the complexity of the target, because of the need for parsimony, nor the qualitative nature of much development progress. As indicated in the review of individual MDGs (webappendix) and table 1, this problem is common to many MDGs. MDG 2 provides a particularly clear example of how specifi c targets can be met without achieving their full intent. For this goal, the measurable target identifi ed for achievement of universal primary education is to ensure that, by 2015, all boys and girls are able to complete a full course of primary schooling. This target is accompanied by three indicators, of which only the fi rst, the net enrolment ratio, has been consistently measured, because the others are more diffi cult to assess. Hence progress on MDG 2 has been represented by changes in this ratio. However, this measure entails a very narrow view of primary education.

This criticism might seem rather severe-specifi c targets and indicators were never meant to measure all progress against a complex goal. Rather, they were meant to be indicative of progress.

Many of the same sectors covered in the MDGs appear in China's 5-year plan for 2006-11, yet the targets diff er. For example, ambitions include average education for citizens to be increased to 9 years, and 100 million rural residents to be provided with access to safe drinking water. 60 The MDGs are an irrelevance to China's own development strategy.

Each MDG, apart from MDG 8, has a global target to be achieved by 2015, usually set as a relative level of progress from the level in 1990 based on historical global trends. These global targets are also set without adjustment as country-level targets. They were never intended as national targets, but they have been consistently applied in this manner, ignoring local context and the intercountry diff erence in technical feasibility and fi nancial aff ordability. The application of global goals to poor African countries which were never expected individually to meet them generates defeatism and negativity locally, and \"Afropessimism\" on an international scale. 24 The linear extrapolations on which several MDG targets are based might possibly fi t the averaging that is inherent in setting global goals, but they could be entirely inappropriate as a measure of national progress. For example, the capacity to reduce child mortality rates in any country is more likely to be S-shaped than linear. 69 Initial eff orts in the presence of high mortality rates need much eff ort for modest improvements. Then as services in health systems are established, there is a phase during which substantial improvements are possible with rather less input. Finally, there is a phase in which much greater eff ort and resources are needed to make further improvements. The assumption that a similar eff ort in any country will produce a similar reduction in child mortality was naive, since experience with child mortality reduction shows that for most African countries to achieve MDG 4 will be almost impossible.",

The diffi culties for teachers in using the curriculum to question and change these assumptions are compounded by employment practices, which often make it diffi cult for women, who make up a large part of the teaching profession, to gain promotion. 51 Although the HIV epidemic off ered many opportunities for schools to engage in refl ection on questions of sex and gender, and some creative engagements emerged, it was often very diffi cult to challenge deeply-held assumptions. Many studies identify practices of gender-based violence in schools or associated with teachers and the policy challenges that these entail.

Inequity is usually described in economic terms, most frequently as wealth quintiles, based on possessions owned by the household. 71 This is a convenient approach that can be applied to information such as the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data to analyse income or consumption. In many settings, wealth quintiles eff ectively indicate other inequities within a society. They draw attention to diff erences in key markers of access and outcome between those who do and do not have material assets, which provide a mechanism to examine diff erences between countries in terms of how these assets are distributed. Some specifi c measures of inequalities in wealth have been developed, such as the Gini coeffi cient which measures the extent to which distribution of wealth is uneven. Other measures are the ratio of the incomes of the richest 10% or 20% of the population compared with the poorest 10% or 20%. 72 The use of wealth quintiles as a means to measure equity has featured explicitly in only one MDG target, MDG 1 target 1A, for which indicators include measurement of a poverty gap ratio (between lowest and highest wealth quintiles) and the share of the poorest quintile in national consumption. However, wealth quintiles have been used extensively in analyses of healthrelated MDGs undertaken by the World Bank, UNICEF, and others, 73,74 and very recently in work into the distribution of education enrolment rates. 9 But wealth, income, or consumption are not the only features of inequity. Factors such as geography and ethnic origin might be more important in identifi cation of inequities, both in access and outcome of health interventions. 75 In rural Papua New Guinea and Ethiopia, the most important determinant of access to health care, and health outcomes, may be geography. Asset indices do not always predict health outcomes. In some settings, geography, ethnic origin, or other factors might be more dominant factors. But the absence of measures that capture these other factors across diff erent societies means that these features of inequity in distribution are overlooked.",

The outcome of such an emergency, especially when children are involved, is strongly aff ected by the extent of women's empowerment within a community. 76 Several studies in high-income countries show that inequality is often associated with other social ills.

Preservation of inequity or lack of distribution for some, while addressing suffi ciency or better for others, is not the way to maximise benefi ts for a society. Many of the targets associated with the MDGs focus on improving conditions for some, but not addressing wellbeing for all. This inequity is the case for all targets that focus on changing the proportion of people experiencing a particular hardship-eg, reducing the maternal mortality ratio or the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day. Even when these MDG targets are achieved, a proportion of the population would remain below a line of adequacy and the inequities within a society would not be resolved. Reduction of the number of people living on $1 a day or less will relieve some people from extreme poverty, but only just. If action is directed only at those near the threshold, the eff ect might be to increase inequity, pulling those accessible populations across the poverty line, thereby widening the gap between them and those still below the threshold. The fundamental inequities in income distribution will remain and will continue to erode the foundation of society.",

For example, in India in 2005, children achieved an average 7\u00b75 years in school, nearly completing a cycle of primary and elementary education. Children from the richest quintile, both boys and girls, completed on average 11 years of schooling, whereas boys from the poorest quintile completed 5 years of schooling, and girls completed only 3 years. 9 Thus, although India was on track to meet the MDG 2 target, inequities in educational opportunities were being perpetuated between diff erent population groups, and between the sexes. For MDG 7, improvements in access to improved sanitation are substantial, but are also strongly associated with the wealthiest quintiles of the population. 4 Health interventions associated with MDGs 4, 5, and 6 are mainly applied through established health services, tending to favour the same individuals who have been covered by previous interventions. They might live near the road or the health post, have relatives who have been trained as health workers, or have access to information. Those who are both geographically and socially far away from the rest of the population do not receive the intervention. A district level study 80 of child mortality in Tanzania since 1988 draws attention to the fact that in a poor African country that has made admirable progress towards child survival, there is substantial variability in the progress made, and the districts that were doing well in 1988 improved at a greater rate than did the poorer districts. Thus the improved child survival that Tanzania has recorded has been at the expense of worsening geographical inequity. 80 In education, many countries have expanded access to primary education through abolishment of school fees (eg, Mozambique, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya); however, this intervention has not always meant that all costs associated with schooling are lifted from poor parents or that high-quality education is delivered. Indeed, in many countries the poorest children have the least qualifi ed and supported teachers. Often the language of instruction at school used by teachers is not the same as that which children speak at home. Families struggle to meet the hidden costs of schooling-eg, costs associated with clothing, transport, or additional tuition. 9 Free education is not necessarily associated with improved equity since other factors, such as attitudes of blame,",

These interventions have been assisted by good weather and high tobacco prices, and high political will to implement pro-poor programmes.

[82] [83] [84] Thus the MDGs promote an approach that might systematically exclude individuals at highest risk, achieving improvements on indicators by focusing on those populations that are easiest to reach. This is not a new occurrence. Even before the appearance of the MDGs, for example, most countries that made substantial gains in child survival between the 1980s and the 1990s achieved these gains at the expense of increasing inequity, since successive interventions targeted and excluded the same groups of children as before. 85, 86 The approach underpinning the MDGs and their targets for poverty, education, gender, health, and the environment is the attainment of a specifi c minimum standard for a proportion of the world's people. There are other possible approaches that would be more equitable. For example, the target might be fully adequate provision for all, taking account for particular heterogeneities, or it might be narrowing of the gap between the most privileged and the most deprived, ensuring that no group is below a level of adequacy. A deliberate, pro-poor or human rights approach can be taken, actively addressing inequities and realising rights for the poorest people. Some countries, such as Peru, have deliberately adopted a pro-poor approach to child-survival strategies. 87 Unfortunately, such countries are the exception.",

Hence we focus on what might come after the MDGs, in view of the MDG experience. This is not to belittle in any way the importance of trying to achieve the existing MDGs in the next 5 years. Our premise is that, whether or not present MDGs are continued, modifi ed, or replaced after 2015, we should move forward having learned the lessons of the previous 15 years, and addressed any weaknesses that have become apparent in MDGs. In part 1, we examined individual MDGs and identifi ed their specifi c challenges, which we used in part 2 to draw out common challenges that cut across the goals. We found that the core challenges relate to reducing gaps and fragmentation in the MDGs, enhancing their integration, improving targeting and indicators, and ensuring equity and ownership. The reasons for fragmentation, incoherence, and gaps in the existing MDGs lie in their origins; although they included goals from a range of sectors, a common, cross-sectoral vision of development was not the basis for their formulation. Rather, as we have noted in part 1, the specifi c goals that emerged from the MDG formulation process were largely targets established in independent, earlier sectoral initiatives, grouped together and edited for political sensitivity, to maximise broad international support. Looking forward, we consider that any project after 2015 should be built on a coherent and shared approach to development, which can guide action across diff erent sectors including, but not confi ned to, addressing poverty, inequity, and environmental degradation, and improving gender equity, education, and health.",

Particularly striking has been the progress made towards achievement of universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS for all those who need it. By the end of 2008, 200 435 adults were estimated to be receiving antiretroviral drugs, representing 66\u00b73% of the estimated need. 63 However, although the prevalence of HIV fell slightly to 14\u00b73% in 2007 64 compared with 15\u00b76% in 2002, 65 the results of the 2009 epidemiological synthesis study suggest continued transmission of infection, with 1\u00b76% of the adult population becoming newly infected every year. 66 This fi nding implies that to get close to attainment of the 2015 targets there needs to be a renewed focus on prevention of new infections. The National Prevention Strategy articulates the key drivers of the epidemic in Zambia and will guide the prevention eff orts in the next 5 years. 67 Overall, the 2008 National Progress Report on the MDGs suggests that, with the exception of MDG 7, the country is likely or potentially likely to attain the MDGs by 2015. 68 However, continued reliance on external donor support implies that the sector is vulnerable to the global economic climate, as has been experienced in 2009. The ability to maintain any gains in health indicators after 2015 needs planning that will target the long-term sustainable development of the economy. and means. Hence, we are seeking to make operational some of the ideas that Amartya Sen outlines in The Idea of Justice. 95 Sen's argument is that elaboration of a vision of global justice at the present moment, when there are no appropriate institutions to deliver this vision, might be deemed an exercise in ideal theory; however, it is nonetheless important to focus on the choices that are actually on off er in a globally inter-related world, the plurality of principles and inter pretations that might play a part in view of the diff erent histories and contexts of people, and the permissibility of partial resolutions (ie, that making some things a bit better rather than waiting for the best resolution) could be an important step. Sen also emphasises public reasoning and attention to assessment of human lives in terms of capabilitiesie, reasoned values and the signifi cance accorded by these factors.",

This conceptualisation needs brief elaboration. There are many elements of wellbeing and increasing published work on its application and measurement. 92, 96, 97 Sen views wellbeing as a combination of the aspiration that \"human lives can go much better\" and an understanding that improvement can be brought about through a strengthening of human agency, a person's capability to pursue and realise things that he or she values and has reason to value. 98 Unlike conventional economics that equate wellbeing with happiness, Sen's capability approach suggests that aspects of wellbeing have to consider the things that we really value (whether they make us happy or not) and levels of deprivation, whether or not people report they are happy despite severe want. By suggesting that wellbeing is linked with capabilities-that is the freedom to enjoy various combinations of beings and doings-Sen draws attention to the signifi cance of how diff erent people necessarily have need of and make use of resources in diverse ways. 97 To consider heterogeneity as part of any evaluation of the freedom people have is therefore crucial. Social arrangements for development are thus to be assessed not in the space of resources (inputs) or of outcomes (happiness) but in relation to wellbeing, agency, and capabilities-that is the freedom to promote and achieve functionings that people value. In adoption of an understanding of wellbeing that derives from Sen's ideas, we defi ne wellbeing as the freedoms and capability to make choices and act eff ectively with respect to, for example, health, education, nutrition, employment, security, participation, voice, consumption, and the claiming of rights. For each of these elements of wellbeing, there are important considerations of quality and quantity of achievement, of diversity in aspirations between diff erent communities, of equity, and in some of these aspects (most notably those concerned with material consumption) of the need to recognise satisfaction from suffi cient (as opposed to maximised) achievement, as diminishing marginal returns to consumption are overtaken by increasing marginal costs (including social costs). This approach helps access to improved wellbeing to be both equitable and sustainable. In this section we will discuss the nature and implications of equity and sustainability, but note here their importance as intrinsic features of our development notion.",

The classifi cation of services provided by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 99 is particularly useful, since it makes a distinction between moderating (or regulating), provisioning, supportive, and cultural services. This typology has wider applicability beyond the provision of The printed journal includes an image merely for illustration ecosystem services by natural capital (eg, forests, soils, wetlands, oceans). Thus physical capital (eg, infrastructure and equipment), human capital (eg, knowledge, skills, labour), and social capital (eg, institutions, relationships) all generate moderating (or regulatory) services that provide stability, promote resilience, and reduce systems' sensitivity to change. Similarly, these diff erent types of capital also generate provisioning or productive services (producing goods and services for direct or indirect consumption), supporting services (supporting conditions necessary for and underpinning systems' existence and functioning), and cultural services (which provide communicative, aesthetic, recreational, or spiritual benefi ts). Finally, development has to be explicitly and fundamentally seen as a dynamic process of change. This view involves a plurality of perspectives with several stakeholders, who interact as individuals within and between households, organisations, communities, and nations, with diff ering resources and aspirations. Embedded and emergent properties in systems operating at these diff erent scales mean that changes and transformations within them are interdependent and highly complex. 93 This conceptualisation of development extends beyond that implicit in the MDGs, for which MDGs 1-6 in particular are focused on poverty reduction and the achievement of limited, indeed minimalist, standards of welfare, 13 with little emphasis on wider notions of development or on the condition of people who are not affl icted by extreme poverty. Our notion addresses issues that need commitment and action across countries of low, middle, and high income. In view of the arbitrary nature of the cutoff points in many classifi cations of poor and non-poor people, and the moral arguments that all people have an equal right to aspire to much more than escape from narrow and arbitrarily defi ned levels of poverty, we believe that development goals should extend beyond, but include, minimalist poverty reduction and survival goals.",

This approach will not be easy, but several development issues make the MDGs' focus on a set of goals aimed at increasing the material consumption of poor people less tenable. We draw attention to, for example, a growing acceptance of the need to address population growth, to recognise and restrict the environmental eff ect of human activities, and to understand the limitations of growth based on capitalism and neo-liberalism as a system for delivery of sustainable development. These issues have been ones for which comprehensive agreement is diffi cult to obtain from states with diff erent ideologies and political systems, but they can no longer be avoided. Unterhalter and Carpentier 101 set out this challenge in terms of a so-called development tetralemma faced in the pursuit of mechanisms and systems that simultaneously promote equity, growth, democracy, and sustainability (in which a tetralemma is defi ned as analogous to a dilemma, but involving a set of four crucially important options for which each is necessary but not suffi cient for sustainable development, and they cannot all be achieved together). Almost all present political and economic mechanisms and systems can only achieve some of these at the expense of others; hence they are compromised even in their initial achievements. Experience of the Copenhagen negotiations in December, 2009, on climate change targets and measures shows the diffi culties in getting international agreements on complex and politically sensitive issues aff ecting international and intergenerational investments and concerned with countries' diff ering and evolving domestic aspirations and perceptions of rights and responsibilities. 102, 103 Guiding principles for development goals",

Sen has argued that aspects of equality, whether these are related to rights to hold property, vote, or earn the same level of income, are a core component of ideas about justice in the contemporary world. 105 Although diff erences might exist with regard to what type of equality is valued or emphasised, equality in some space is a central aspiration, and the notion of equity distils the types of social relations entailed in ensuring this aim. Drawing on changing meanings of the word equity in English from the 14th century, Unterhalter 106 has identifi ed three diff erent levels of equity comprising equity from above, which needs a fair system of institutional arrangements; equity from below, which entails processes of participation and discussion; and equity from the middle, which ensures the effi cient fl ow of services, information, and investment.

Ensuring equity of opportunity is often associated with putting in place the institutional arrangements for managed provision of health, education, or employment services. In an economy, these services and opportunities provide employment or provide credit for investment in producing goods to generate income. In education, they include providing appropriately sited schools, making universal opportunities for school attendance, and access to the curriculum through an appropriate language policy and training suffi cient teachers. In health, provision of these services means building suffi cient health facilities, training staff , and ensuring a supply of drugs. For the environment, it means providing access to clean water and air, and harvestable natural resources resulting from the Equity of outcome provides an alternative assessment of whether personal heterogeneities have been considered in relation to health, education, or poverty elimination. Processes that can help to secure this entail attention to participation in the evaluation of services, concern with aff ordability, and adaptability of services to meet diverse circumstances. A principle of equity in development goal settings needs, therefore, to address equity of both opportunity and outcome. Achievement of a level of wellbeing for all people will need the development of a more equitable world, built on more equitable societies in which there are adequate fl ows of information, understanding, resources, training, and respect to enable diverse individuals to attain a decent quality of life.

Sustainable action should be a practice of all stakeholders who have power over the resources a system uses, and it will apply to all scales (eg, from households to nations, from fi elds and small stream catchments to river basins). Such sustainable action is hard to achieve, but is made easier when diff erent services can substitute for each other to improve sustainability. For example, the sustainability of nutrition as an element of wellbeing can be supported by development of improved agricultural and environmental systems, by improved trade and the equitable distribution of foodstuff s, or by changes in personal livelihoods or behaviour that give individuals more reserves to survive periods of want.

            "text": "A broad but clear understanding of the role of productivity is crucial to understand sustainability. Productivity needs to be defi ned in terms of a system's delivery of the provisioning, supportive, regulating, and cultural services that we discussed earlier. Not only does productivity have to be viable in material terms (not depleting resources below stocks needed for the system to operate), it also has to be both viable and acceptable in social and economic terms. Therefore, all stakeholders with (formal or informal) control over resources need to have the ability and incentives to support the maintenance of the system. We draw attention to two implications from this tenet. First, growth in productivity is crucial for the sustainability of many systems, but not a necessary feature of all systems, and the nature and rate of growth needed in a system will vary with the aspirations of stakeholders, changing pressures on systems, and socioeconomic structures and relations. Thus increasing population and aspirations for substantial improvements in wellbeing for poor people makes strong demands for productivity growth, but economic growth associated with increases in material consumption will not be as important for some advanced economies and their sustainability. This notion brings us back to our discussion in part 2 of this report of targets and the important, but widely misunderstood, distinction between global and national targets. Although the sustainability of the planet needs substantial reductions in productivity growth globally, the poorest countries might need to achieve high productivity growth to raise the incomes of the poorest. Second, both equity and ownership are needed in the management of systems and the returns that they off er to diff erent stakeholders. Failure of crucial stakeholders to perceive that they or others benefi t fairly from a system will lead to their withdrawal of resources from that system and its eventual collapse. The requirements of sustainability are therefore inextricably linked with our other principles of holism, equity, ownership, and global obligation.",

However, when applied nationally, results based on wealth quintiles do not always seem to make sense. Sometimes this situation arises because the key drivers of inequity are factors other than economic poverty, so economic poverty might understate the disparities that exist. At other times they point to fundamental problems with the data itself, such as systematic under-reporting. In some African countries, reported levels of neonatal and infant mortality are substantially lower in the poorest quintiles than some of the wealthier ones. 119 This eff ect is almost certainly due to systematic under-reporting in the poorest and most marginalised groups, who are likely to be suspicious of young data collectors coming from the cities.

Furthermore, the cash must be accessible for the person taking care of the sick individual-eg, a mother taking care of her child, or a woman needing ongoing treatment for a chronic disease. Too often women do not have access to cash. Thus, gender becomes an important determinant of inequity. Systematic disempowerment of women is a pervasive barrier to development in all areas, most particularly health and education.

Simple methods are needed to enable countries to decide which factors are most important for them, and to monitor inequities in health, education, and other areas by monitoring one or more of the key determinants, as interventions are being implemented. Monitoring of inequities in both opportunities and outcomes will enable countries to understand whether existing or future programmes are reducing or indeed increasing inequity. For example, in some countries, a detailed analysis of factors associated with child mortality would likely show that, although socioeconomic factors have a role, with low risk recorded in the wealthiest quintile, a more important determinant of mortality risk is living in an area with no eff ective health services. On the basis of such an analysis, the government might then elect to monitor intervention coverage and mortality in a representative sample of such areas to ensure that as mortality is reduced nationally, the equity gap between the highest risk and lowest risk groups is also narrowed.

Here the costs of reaching remote areas with fi xed services can be particularly high, as refl ected in the wide quintile gaps seen for delivery care compared with immunisation, for example. 121 Short of 100% coverage, there are no absolutes. A country might be faced with a real choice of either spending the available funds trying to get 100% coverage, or accepting that 80% is quite good, and electing to use the available funds to introduce a new vaccine, such as that for rotavirus. The utilitarian approach would argue that the net benefi ts are greater if the new vaccine is introduced into the 80% of people already covered, whereas the rights-based approach would argue that the 20% of children have a right to routine vaccines and should be the fi rst priority.

District health systems serve as a close-to-client service hub that is accessible to the vast majority of rural poor people, as refl ected in various indicators: 98% coverage of antenatal care that facilitated rapid nationwide scaling up of the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV programme within a year in 2001, 73% prevalence of modern contraceptive use, and 98% immunisation coverage of DTP3 (third dose of diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and pertussis vaccine). 127 Universal access results in very small rich-poor and urban-rural gaps of use of maternal and child health services, 128 which is a key contributor to MDG 4 and MDG 5.

The same support would help nations to develop their own, most eff ective and appropriate indicators and methods to monitor progress.

We suggest that more attention needs to be focused on the interactions between wealthy and poor countries that constrain poor countries from improving their own health outcomes. These interactions include addressing patterns of training and employment of health workers internationally that leaves poorer countries paying for training of health workers who then settle in wealthier countries. They also include strengthening of science and innovation systems in poorer countries so that they might play a more equitable part in developing and benefi ting from new health services and technologies. This support for developing countries might mean a greater local role in public-private partnerships for medicines development, particularly in the use of local natural resources and indigenous knowledge for development of new treatments. Or it could mean strengthening disease surveillance systems and their ownership by poorer countries to reduce their disproportionate burden of infectious diseases while improving global health security to prevent future disease pandemics.",

The Taskforce undertook a much more comprehensive costing, and estimated a 2005 cost of $54 per head for scaled up services in 2015, with around $9 to come from external fi nancing on the assumption that donor countries lived up to their commitments to development assistance. 33, 34, 132 Both sets of analyses made assumptions on desirable levels of domestic support to health that greatly exceed present levels of government health expenditure. In view of present rates of economic growth and continuing population expansion, sustained development assistance for health and considerable additional domestic fi nance are needed if we are to move towards the collective national and international aspirations for health even over the next decades. Most health expenditure in low-income countries still comes from private, mostly out-of-pocket payments (mean of $13 per head in 2006), with domestic government budgets contributing an average of $12, and development assistance making a smaller but important contribution of $6. 33 The goal of the above health intervention and system strengthening initiatives is to plan, design, and build an effi cient, equitable, and responsive health system without the distorting eff ects and special pleading of particular interest groups. Sector-wide approaches to fi nancing encourage all interested partners, both domestic governmental and external investors, to pool their resources so that one health plan can be implemented, monitored, and reported upon. The challenge that has arisen in some countries is that when domestic budgets are tightened, and external donors do not meet their expected contributions, there are not enough resources for all. In this situation the fi xed recurrent costs, particularly salaries, still have to be met, and as a result funds for services and commodities are unavailable, leading to shortages and stock-outs even for those activities that are seen as key priorities within the plan. Thus, proponents of specifi c interventions-such as vaccination for children, or completion of tuberculosis treatment to prevent emergence of costly drug resistance-have good grounds to advocate for protected funding for a few key programmes. And so we rapidly fall back into the same discussion of disease-specifi c programmes in tension with broader system-wide strengthening of the building blocks of the health system.",

A strong case can be made for disproportionate and unsustainable investment if there is a realistic chance that in the longer term such investment will lead to eradication of a disease and consequent gains in wellbeing (and reductions in ongoing costs). The eradication of smallpox from the world and the recent success in elimination of severe acute respiratory syndrome from human populations are notable triumphs led by WHO. However, expensive campaigns against poliomyelitis that disrupt community health services have seen recent set-backs, and the shift from control to elimination of malaria has been argued in Africa to be \"at best irrelevant and at worst counterproductive\". 133 For HIV there are ambitious mathematical models suggesting that major investment in testing and early treatment could lead to overall savings in the future by reducing transmission. 134 Thus sustainability for infectious diseases might have a diff erent tenor to sustainability for health in general, for which we need to plan for ongoing and expanding costs that can be met only by a concerted and planned eff ort to draw on both domestic and external fi nance, including from innovative sources. 34 This is especially the case as the non communicable disease burden rises as the epidemiological transition proceeds.",
