Is4 As part of our ongoing program to isolate new antiviral compounds from marine organisms we collected a sample of HuIimeda tuna, the crude extract of which showed significant in-vitro activity against murine coronavirus strain A5Y.5 We report here the isolation and structure elucidation of halitunal(l), the major antiviral constituent of this extract.",

A 54 gram sample of thawed wet alga was extracted twice with 3:1 methanol:toluene and the extracts combined to give 131 mg of crude material after solvent removal. The crude solids were partitioned between water and n-butanol. The butanol fraction, which contained the antiviral clearly estabished the presence of partial structure A (Figure 1 ) in 1. Aside from partial structure A, a total of seven degrees of unsaturation remain to be accounted for in the molecule, of which 5 are required by the remaining 8 olefinic carbon atoms and aldehyde group. Thus the remaining portion of the molecule must contain two rings. Due to the numerous remaining quaternary centers and limited amount of pure compound, we utilized an HMBC experiment\" to establish the remaining connectivities. HMBC cross peaks were observed from H17 to Cl, C6, C7, and from Hl to C17, Ch and C3.",

HMBC correlations from H4 to C3, Cl6 , C5 and C6 along with correlations from H5 to C3, C4, C6, and C2 establish the cyclopentadiene partial structure C in Figure 1 . A 3-bond HMBC correlation from Hl to C3 necessitates attachment of Cl to C2. A C7-C6 bond is indicated by a 3-bond HMBC correlation from HI7 to C6, thus completing the fusion of partial structures B and C. The attachment of partial structure A at C7 can be made due to HMBC correlations from H8 to C7 (two bond), Cl7 and C6 (both three-bond). This completes the overall connectivity assignment, which is shown in Figure 2 with all HMBC correlations observed. A straightforward biosynthetic pathway giving rise to 1 can be envisioned starting from the known diterpenoid tetra-acetate 2 , previously reported as a major metabolite of Halimda tuna.2 As shown in Figure   3 , cyclization of enol acetate 2 results in ati intermediate 2, which, after loss of two molecules of acetic acid, rearrangement and hydrolysis, yields 1.
