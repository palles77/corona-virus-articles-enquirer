            "text": "Antibody Paramyxovirus P/V mutant P/V gene substitutions convert the non-cytopathic paramyxovirus Simian Virus 5 (SV5), which is a poor inducer of host cell responses in human tissue culture cells, into a mutant (P/V-CPI\u2212) that induces high levels of apoptosis, interferon (IFN)-beta, and proinflammatory cytokines. However, the effect of SV5-P/V gene mutations on virus growth and adaptive immune responses in animals has not been determined. Here, we used two distinct animal model systems to test the hypothesis that SV5-P/V mutants which are more potent activators of innate responses in tissue culture will also elicit higher antiviral antibody responses. In mouse cells, in vitro studies identified a panel of SV5-P/V mutants that ranged in their ability to limit IFN responses. Intranasal infection of mice with these WT and P/V mutant viruses elicited equivalent anti-SV5 IgG responses at all doses tested, and viral titers recovered from the respiratory tract were indistinguishable. In primary cultures of ferret lung fibroblasts, WT rSV5 and P/V-CPI\u2212 viruses had phenotypes similar to those established in human cell lines, including differential induction of IFN secretion, IFN signaling and apoptosis. Intranasal infection of ferrets with a low dose of WT rSV5 elicited~500 fold higher anti-SV5 serum IgG responses compared to the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant, and this correlated with overall higher viral titers for the WT virus in tracheal tissues. There was a dose-dependent increase in antibody response to infection of ferrets with P/V-CPI\u2212, but not with WT rSV5. Together our data indicate that WT rSV5 and P/V mutants can elicit distinct innate and adaptive immunity phenotypes in the ferret animal model system, but not in the mouse system. We present a model for the effect of P/V gene substitutions on SV5 growth and immune responses in vivo.",

            "text": "Members of the paramyxovirus family of negative strand RNA viruses employ a diverse range of mechanisms to circumvent host cell antiviral responses, including limiting cytokine and type I interferon (IFN) synthesis, blocking IFN signaling pathways and inhibiting apoptosis (reviewed in Conzelmann, 2005; Garcia-Sastre, 2001; Goodbourn et al., 2000; Horvath, 2004) . Many of these mechanisms for counteracting cellular responses have been attributed to products of the P/V gene which typically encodes both the phosphoprotein P subunit of the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (Kolakofsky et al, 2004) and the V protein which counteracts antiviral responses (Didcock et al., 1999a,b; Parisien et al., 2001) . For some paramyxoviruses, the P/V gene also encodes the family of multifunctional C proteins that are involved in suppressing antiviral responses and in controlling viral gene expression and virion release (Devaux and Cattaneo, 2004; Garcin et al., 2001; Lamb and Parks, 2007) . For Simian Virus 5 (SV5), accurate transcription of the P/V gene results in mRNA that codes for the accessory V protein. The P mRNA is identical to the V mRNA except for the addition of two nontemplated G residues that are inserted by the viral polymerase at a precise location in the P/V transcript (Thomas et al.,1988) . Thus, the SV5 P and V proteins are identical for the 164 amino-terminal residues (the shared P/V region), but differ in their C-terminal sequences. The P and V proteins have unique C-terminal domains, with the V protein encoding a highly conserved cysteine-rich (cys-rich) zinc-binding domain that is required for many V-associated functions Paterson et al., 1995) .",

Mutational analyses have identified amino acid differences in the P/V region between WT SV5 and CPI\u2212 that are responsible for defects in targeting STAT1 for degradation (Chatziandreou et al., 2002) . We have previously engineered a recombinant rSV5 mutant (P/V-CPI\u2212) to encode these same six CPI\u2212 P/V substitutions in the background of the WT rSV5 genome . Our analyses have shown that in human cells, these P/V gene substitutions converted WT rSV5 into a mutant that could not induce loss of STAT1 as expected, but the P/V mutant was also found to be a potent inducer of IFN and proinflammatory cytokines Young et al., 2006) .",

During serial passage of SV5-infected mouse tissue culture cells, a viral isolate was identified (mci-2) which had gained the ability to block IFN signaling (Young et al., 2001) .

Our panel of SV5 variants represents viruses that are poor inducers (WT rSV5 and P/V-N100D) and potent inducers (P/V-CPI\u2212) of antiviral pathways. Given the role of IFN as an adjuvant (Bracci et al., 2006; Braun et al., 2002; Fink et al., 2006) , we hypothesized that SV5 variants that induce higher levels of host cell responses would elicit higher adaptive immune responses, such as anti-SV5 antibodies. However, given the role of IFN as an inhibitor of virus replication (Didcock et al., 1999a; Goodbourn et al., 2000) , an alternative hypothesis was that the variants which elicit higher levels of host cell responses would be restricted for growth, which could in turn lead to lower antibody titers (Atmar et al., 2007; Braciale et al., 1976; Mak et al., 1982) .",

Together, these data support previous reports (Young et al., 2001 ) that mouse cells infected with the P/V-N100D virus are defective in response to IFN, but extend those findings to show that the P/V-N100D mutant blocks STAT1 phosphorylation by a mechanism that does not include targeted degradation.",

To test the hypothesis that infection with these viruses induced IFN, CL7 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter gene plasmid under control of the IFN-beta promoter and infected at high moi with the viruses indicated in Fig. 3A . Levels of luciferase were determined at 15 h pi. Infection with the two viruses encoding a WT P/V gene (rSV5-WT and rSV5-GFP) resulted in a~2-3 fold increase in IFN-beta promoter activity, whereas cells infected with the P/V-CPI\u2212 virus showed nearly a 10 fold increase. By contrast, cells infected with the P/V-N100D mutant showed luciferase levels that were indistinguishable from those seen with mock-infected cells. These results were supported by ELISA data, in which levels of secreted IFN-beta and IFN-alpha were determined at 24 h pi. As shown in Fig. 3B , the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant induced slightly higher levels of IFNbeta than either the rSV5-WT or rSV5-GFP viruses. However, the P/V-N100D mutant was a poor inducer of IFN-beta.

As predicted by these properties, the P/V-N100D virus grew in CL7 cells to titers that were approximately 2 logs higher in multi-step growth assays (Fig. 4A ). Unexpectedly however, the P/V-CPI\u2212 virus grew to higher titers than rSV5-GFP (Fig. 4B ), despite being a more potent activator of IFN responses.

Infected animals showed no clinical signs of illness and pathological lesions in the nasal cavities were mild, consisting of infiltration by mixed type inflammatory cells, superficial epithelial injury and edema (data not shown). At the days pi shown in Fig. 5 , sera were collected and used in an SV5-specific ELISA to determine the titers of IgG 1 and IgG 2a . These isotypes were chosen because they are indicative of the CD4+ TH cell response to virus infection (Finkelman et al., 1990) , and therefore provide an internal control to our experiment that would ensure we were not missing any portion of the antibody response because of a missing TH1 or TH2 population. There was a dose-dependent increase in the anti-SV5 IgG 1 (Fig. 5A ) and IgG 2a (Fig. 5B ) isotype response following i.n. infection of mice with doses between 10 4 and 10 6 pfu, and the highest dose of virus yielded final titers that were nearly 100-fold higher than the low dose of virus. A dose of 10 7 pfu did not significantly increase responses over that seen with 10 6 pfu. Most importantly however, there was no difference in antibody titers elicited with the WT rSV5 parental virus and P/V-N100D virus. Similarly, there was no difference in the antibody responses elicited by rSV5-GFP compared to the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant (data not shown).",

As shown in Fig. 8A , ferret cells infected with the rSV5-GFP virus showed very little CPE similar to that seen with mockinfected cells. By contrast, ferret cells infected with the P/V mutant virus showed extensive CPE. Cell viability assays (Fig. 8B) showed that cell cultures infected with rSV5-GFP had very little loss of viability. P/V mutant-infected fibroblasts showed a time-dependent loss of viability starting at~48 h pi, and by 72 h pi very few viable cells were detected. The loss of viability in P/V-CPI\u2212 infected ferret cells correlated with increased levels of annexin V staining. This is evident in Fig. 8C , where rSV5-GFP infection resulted in a very low percentage of cells that were positive for annexin V staining. By contrast,~65% of ferret cells infected with the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant were positive for annexin V by 48 h pi. Taken together, the above data indicate that infection of primary cultures of ferret lung fibroblasts with WT and P/V mutant SV5 reproduces a number of phenotypes of infected human cells, including multi-step growth kinetics and differential activation of IFN pathways (Fig. 7) , and apoptosis (Fig. 8) . Antibody responses to respiratory infection of ferrets with WT rSV5 and P/V mutant Based on the above in vitro data in primary ferret fibroblasts, we tested the hypothesis that i.n. infection of ferrets with these viruses would elicit different antibody titers. Ferrets had no detectable preexisting antibodies that recognized SV5 in ELISAs (not shown). Groups of three ferrets each were infected i.n. with increasing doses (10 4 , 10 6 or 10 8 pfu) of purified rSV5-GFP or P/V-CPI\u2212 virus and boosted with an equivalent amount of the homologous virus on day 28 pi. Infected animals showed no clinical signs of illness, and pathological lesions in the nasal cavities included minimal submucosal edema and small amounts of luminal hemorrhage. Significant lesions were not found in the lung or brain (data not shown). Thus, infection of ferrets with SV5 doses as high as 10 8 pfu was well tolerated. 9 . Antibody response and viral titers elicited by intranasal infection of ferrets with rSV5-GFP and P/V-CPI\u2212. A and B) ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers. Groups of 3 ferrets each were infected i.n. with 10 4 , 10 6 , or 10 8 pfu of rSV5-GFP or P/V-CPI\u2212. At day 28 pi, serum was collected and ferrets were boosted with an equivalent amount of homologous virus. Levels of anti-SV5 antibodies in serum from day 28 and d14 post boost (panel A) and neutralizing titers in d28 and d14 post boost serum (panel B) were determined as described in Materials and methods. Each symbol represents data for an individual ferret with the horizontal bars indicating the mean value for the group. Results are representative of two independent experiments. C) Viral titers. Ferrets were infected i.n. with 10 4 pfu of rSV5-GFP or P/V-CPI\u2212, and viral titers in the upper trachea of animals were determined at the indicated days pi. Each symbol represents the titer for one experimental animal, and the bar represents the mean value for the group. Sera that were collected before boosting on day 28 pi and on day 14 post boost (pb) were assayed for levels of SV5-specific IgG by ELISA as described in the Materials and methods. As shown in Fig. 9A , ferrets that received the P/V-CPI\u2212 virus showed a dose-dependent increase in anti-SV5 antibody titers following the primary infection (left panel, open boxes), with mean titers reaching~10 4 at the dose of 10 8 pfu. By contrast, ferrets that received rSV5-GFP (closed diamonds, Fig. 9A ) showed the highest mean anti-SV5 titers with the lowest dose of virus in the primary infection (10 4 ). With increasing doses of rSV5-GFP there was a slight decrease in titer that was statistically significant (p = 0.001). Most importantly, at the lowest dose of virus (10 4 pfu), rSV5-GFP elicited a mean antibody titer that was~500 fold higher than that elicited with the P/V-CPI\u2212 virus, and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0002). With increased doses of 10 6 and 10 8 pfu, the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant elicited higher antibody titers, whereas rSV5-GFP elicited lower titers. Mean antibody titers to rSV5-GFP and the P/V mutant at 10 6 and 10 8 pfu were not statistically different. Thus, in the primary infection, a low dose of rSV5-GFP is more effective than the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant at inducing anti-SV5 antibody responses. At higher doses, there is an increased response to P/V-CPI\u2212 and a slightly decreased response to rSV5-GFP such that the antibody responses are now equivalent.",

This hypothesis was based on our previous work showing that: 1) the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant was more effective than WT rSV5 at activating innate responses in cell culture , and 2) human DC infected with the P/V-CPI\u2212 virus are more effective at activating T cell functions in vitro than DC infected with WT rSV5 (Arimilli et al., 2006) . Likewise, it has been proposed that viruses encoding defective antagonists of antiviral responses would be more effective vectors for eliciting adaptive immunity (Talon et al., 2000; Valarcher et al., 2003) . Here we show that primary cultures of ferret lung fibroblasts reproduce many of the in vitro human cell culture properties of WT SV5 and P/V-CPI\u2212 described previously, including differences in STAT1 degradation, induction of IFN synthesis and signaling, and CPE. Most importantly for our hypothesis, low dose intranasal infection of ferrets with WT and P/V mutant SV5 elicited different antibody responses, and different levels of virus were recovered from the ferret trachea. By contrast, in the mouse model system WT and P/V mutants showed differences in their ability to counteract IFN responses in tissue culture cells, but intranasal infection of mice with these mutants did not result in differences in either virus growth or antibody responses at any dose tested. Together, these data support the proposal that ferrets represent an excellent animal model system for in vivo analysis of SV5 growth and immune responses.",

In our primary cultures of ferret cells, WT SV5 efficiently targeted ferret STAT1 for degradation, whereas the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant which is defective for this property in human cells is also defective in STAT1 degradation in ferret cells. Furthermore, our results show that the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant virus induced higher levels of IFN-beta mRNA than WT rSV5, consistent with this mutant virus being defective in limiting IFN induction in ferret cells. The inability to limit IFN induction and signaling pathways likely contributes to the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant virus having attenuated low moi growth in ferret cells compared to WT SV5, a property also seen during infections of human tissue culture cells (Wansley et al., 2005) .

Ferrets are highly susceptible to a number of experimental viral respiratory infections, including influenza virus (Zitzow et al., 2002) , canine distemper virus (CDV; Hoover et al., 1989; Svitek and von Messling, 2007) , and SARSassociated corona virus (Martina et al., 2003) .

In our studies, infection of the ferret respiratory tract with WT SV5 or the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant resulted in no overt indication of illnessanimals remained playful with no changes in either body weight or temperature. Likewise, analyses of respiratory tract tissues did not provide any evidence of virus-induced pathology (data not shown). These results are consistent with previous work examining the pathology of the bone fide CPI virus in ferrets (Baumgartner et al., 1989 , and with a mouse model system in which SV5 was only pathogenic under conditions in which immune responses were severely compromised, such as in STAT1-deficient mice Randall and Young, 1991) .",

For both WT and P/V mutant SV5, virus was detected in tissue from the ferret upper trachea, but there was no detectable virus in tissues from the lung or lower trachea as described previously for CPI infections of ferrets . Importantly, at a low dose of 10 4 pfu the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant elicited~500 fold lower anti-SV5 antibody response than that seen with the same dose of WT virus. In addition, the antibody response to P/V-CPI\u2212 infection increased as the dose was increased between 10 6 and 10 8 pfu, whereas this was not seen with WT rSV5. Finally, with P/V-CPI\u2212, the anti-SV5 antibody titer was increased by~1 log following a secondary infection, whereas anti-SV5 responses were not altered following a booster infection with WT rSV5. Future work will focus on whether there is also a dose-dependent difference in cellular immune response to these two viruses, but this will require the development of appropriate ferret-specific reagents for cellular immunology.",

            "text": "Why is the antibody response to low dose infection with the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant so much lower than that elicited by the WT SV5 virus? One of our original hypotheses was that the P/V-CPI\u2212 virus, which induces DC maturation and is defective in limiting cytokine induction and counteracting IFN, would elicit higher-than-WT levels of antibodies, possibly due to the positive effects of innate cytokines on adaptive immune responses (Bracci et al., 2006; Braun et al., 2002; Fink et al 2006) . As an alternative hypothesis, the induction of innate responses to P/V-CPI\u2212 could limit virus replication, which in turn could limit the antibody responses. Our results are consistent with the second hypothesis, since i.n. infection with the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant elicited lower antibody titers than that seen with WT rSV5 and lower levels of virus were recovered from the ferret respiratory tract. At higher doses of both viruses, we hypothesize that there is an increase in either the number or type of infected cells. In the case of the P/V mutant, this could overcome limitations in viral replication seen at the lower doses, resulting in higher antibody titers. With WT rSV5, we have shown that higher doses elicited slightly lower anti-SV5 antibodies, possibly due to different cell types being infected. Future work will focus on directly determining the levels of viral antigen and replication following infection with different doses of WT and P/V mutant SV5.",

            "text": "It is possible that ferret dendritic cells (DC) play a role in the antibody response to SV5 infection, since DC play a critical role in linking the innate and adaptive arms of the immune response to pathogens (Palucka and Banchereau, 1999) . Our previous cell culture studies have shown that apoptosis is induced in human immature dendritic cells infected with WT rSV5, but not with the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant (Arimilli et al., 2006 (Arimilli et al., , 2007 . Likewise, DC infected with the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant are more effective activators of T cell functions than DC infected with WT rSV5 (Arimilli et al., 2006) . The role that DC plays in different ferret antibody profiles elicited by WT SV5 and the P/V mutant has not yet been evaluated. Anti-SV5 responses could be the result of DC acquiring antigen by direct infection or by crosspresentation. In the former case, differences in dose-dependent antibody responses to WT and P/V mutant SV5 could be explained by ferret DC being more readily infected in vivo at high rather than at low doses of virus. In the case of the P/V mutant, higher doses could lead to more infected DC and to a higher anti-SV5 response. In the case of WT SV5, higher doses could lead to virus-induced apoptosis of infected DC, and this could contribute to the slight decrease in antibody responses compared to the P/V-CPI\u2212 virus. Further experimentation is required to test this proposed mechanism involving ferret DC.",

Alternatively, levels of anti-HN or -F antibodies elicited by the P/V mutant may be low, but could be superior in their capacity for neutralization compared to higher levels elicited by rSV5-GFP, perhaps due to the adjuvant effect of cytokines elicited by the P/V mutant.

Unexpectedly how-ever, the P/V-N100D virus was found to be a poor inducer of IFN synthesis. Thus, the change of asparagine residue 100 to aspartic acid in the P and V proteins confers two new phenotypes on WT rSV5: a block in IFN signaling as shown by Young et al. (2001) and lower induction of IFN secretion. More detailed work is needed to uncover the mechanism by which the N100D mutation alters the ability of SV5 to limit IFN production. For the purposes of this study, our cell culture work identified a panel of WT and P/V mutants with decreasing ability to limit murine IFN induction and signaling pathways: N100DNWT rSV5 N P/V-CPI\u2212.",

Following i.n. infection of mice, anti-SV5 antibody responses were similar between WT SV5 and each of our P/V mutants at all doses tested. Likewise, there was no detectable difference in levels of virus recovered from mice infected with any of the SV5 viruses. These data indicate that there are restrictions on virus growth in the murine respiratory tract that are not evident in our cell culture system, and that they are independent of any differences in P/V mutations. It is unlikely that these restrictions are due exclusively to IFN, since the growth of WT SV5 and P/V-CPI\u2212 in mice deficient in the IFN receptor (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice) was very similar and was not significantly enhanced over normal mice (data not shown). In this regard, there may be species specific restrictions in SV5 replication in murine cells, since the yield of SV5 progeny from CL7 mouse tissue culture cells is~100-1000 fold lower that that typically seen with human cell lines in vitro. Kraus et al. (2008) have recently reported a transgenic mouse system in which WT rSV5 can induce STAT1 degradation and block IFN signaling. In these human STAT2 transgenic (hSTAT2 Tg) mice, WT rSV5 grows to~100 fold higher titer in the respiratory tract compared to normal control mice (Kraus et al., 2008) . Why is virus replication enhanced in the case of WT SV5 infection of hSTAT2 Tg mice compared to normal mice, but the N100D mutant, which is a poor inducer of IFN and blocks IFN signaling, grows to titers that are similar to WT rSV5? One possibility is that there may be added benefit to virus replication by degrading STAT1 in the case of WT rSV5-infected hSTAT2 Tg mice versus blocking STAT1 phosphorylation as our data indicate for the P/V-N100D mutant. In this regard, there is evidence that STAT1 may serve as a constitutive transcription factor for basal expression of some cellular genes (reviewed in Horvath, 2000) , and virus replication in vivo may be enhanced when this function is eliminated due to STAT1 degradation. A second possibility is that lymphocytes recruited to the site of infection in hSTAT2 Tg mice may differ in their capacity to mount antiviral responses compared to control normal mice. An analysis of the effector functions of lymphocytes in the hSTAT2 Tg mouse and P/V-N100D systems may shed light on this proposal.",
