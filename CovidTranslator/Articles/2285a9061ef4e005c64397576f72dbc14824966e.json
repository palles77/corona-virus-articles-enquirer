            "text": "In this study, we report the complete genome sequence of two contemporary human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) strains detected in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Comparative genetic analyses of the circulating strains and the prototype HCoV-OC43 strain (ATCC VR759) were performed. Remarkably, a lower than expected similarity is found between the complete genomes and more in particular between the spike genes of the BE03 and BE04 strains. This finding suggests the existence of two genetically distinct HCoV-OC43 strains, circulating in Belgium in 2003 and 2004. Spike gene sequencing of three additional 2003 and two additional 2004 HCoV-OC43 strains, and subsequent phylogenetic analysis confirm this assumption. Compared to the ATCC prototype HCoV-OC43 strain, an important amino acid substitution is present in the potential cleavage site sequence of the spike protein of all contemporary strains, restoring the N-RRXRR-C motif, associated with increased spike protein cleavability in bovine coronaviruses. We here describe specific characteristics associated with circulating HCoV-OC43 strains, and we provide substantial evidence for the genetic variability of HCoV-OC43. D",

Until now, five types of human coronaviruses have been described: HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, the recently characterized HCoV-HKU1 and the causal agent of the SARS outbreak, the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). HCoV-OC43 (ICTVdb code 19.0.1.0.006) and HCoV-229E (ICTVdb code 19.0.1.0.005) were isolated in 1967 from volunteers at the Common Cold Unit in Salisbury, UK. HCoV-OC43 was initially propagated on ciliated human embryonic tracheal and nasal organ cultures (OC) (McIntosh et al., 1967) . HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E are responsible for 10 to 30% of all common colds, and infections occur mainly during the winter and early spring (Larson et al., 1980) . The incubation period is 2 to 4 days. During the 2002 -2003 winter season, a new human coronavirus, HCoV-NL63, was isolated in The Netherlands (van der Hoek et al., 2004) . The frequent detection of HCoV-NL63 in patient samples worldwide indicates that HCoV-NL63 can be considered as a new important etiologic agent in respiratory tract infections (Arden et al., 2005; Bastien et al., 2005; Mo\u00ebs et al., 2005) . Coronaviruses infect all age groups, and reinfections are common. The infection can be subclinical and is usually mild, but there have been reports of more severe lower respiratory tract involvement in infants and elderly people (Gagneur et al., 2002; Vabret et al., 2003) . Unlike HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV and also HCoV-NL63 appear to be associated with more severe respiratory symptoms like pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Only recently, a fifth human coronavirus type, HCoV-HKU1, has been discovered in two patients with pneumonia, and based on genomic analysis, HCoV-HKU1 was proposed to be a distant member of group 2 coronaviruses (Woo et al., 2005) .",

We demonstrated a high rate of similarity with bovine coronaviruses, and we postulated that both viruses diverged from each other (Vijgen et al., 2005a) . Molecular clock analysis situated the most recent common ancestor of both viruses around 1890. The evolutionary rate of the HCoV-OC43/BCoV pair was estimated in the order of 10 \u00c04 nucleotide substitutions per site per year (Vijgen et al., 2005a) , which is in the same range as reported for other RNA viruses (Domingo and Holland, 1988) . The prototype HCoV-OC43 strain is, however, a laboratory strain, that since its isolation in 1967 was passaged seven times in human embryonic tracheal organ culture, followed by 15 passages in suckling mouse brain, and an unknown number of passages in human rectal tumor HRT-18 cells and/or Vero cells. During the passage history, it is likely that a number of mutations have accumulated. Recently, St-Jean et al. (2004) reported the complete genome sequence of a HCoV-OC43 clinical isolate, designated Paris. A high degree of genetic stability was stated for HCoV-OC43 since only 6 nucleotide variations in the whole genome could be observed in comparison to the HCoV-OC43 ATCC strain, with isolation dates 34 years apart. Based on evolutionary analyses, we demonstrated that this finding seems unlikely, and we suggested that the HCoV-OC43 Paris isolate might have been a result of cross-contamination with the ATCC HCoV-OC43 strain (Vijgen et al., 2005b) . In this study, we present the complete genome sequence data of two contemporary non-cell culture adapted HCoV-OC43 strains. The HCoV-OC43 BE03 strain (isolate 87309) was detected in 2003 from a 2-year-old girl suffering from bronchiolitis, and the HCoV-OC43 BE04 strain (isolate 19572) was detected in 2004 in a 1-year old boy, who presented with rhinitis, bronchiolitis and coughing. Both patients were hospitalized at the University Hospital in Leuven, Belgium. Spike gene sequence data are also determined for three additional 2003 and two additional 2004 HCoV-OC43 strains. Phylogenetic and comparative sequence analyses of these data are performed, providing closer insights in the HCoV-OC43 genetic variability.",

Complete genome sequence comparisons to the HCoV-OC43 ATCC prototype strain sequenced by St-Jean et al. (AY585228) and the Paris isolate (AY585229) show similar results: 99.0% identity is found between the BE03 strain and the ATCC strain (AY585228) as well as between the BE03 strain and the Paris isolate. For the HCoV-OC43 BE04 strain 98.9% similarity with the complete genome sequences of both the ATCC strain (AY585228) and the Paris isolate is found. The genetic divergence between the prototype and each of the contemporary HCoV-OC43 strains roughly corresponds to an evolutionary rate of about 2.7 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 nucleotide substitutions per site per year. The 2003 and 2004 HCoV-OC43 strains show 99.4% similarity throughout their complete genomes. When comparing the genome sequence data of the HCoV-OC43 ATCC (AY391777) and contemporary strains, several nucleotide deletions and insertions are observed in the 3Vpart of the genome (Fig. 1) . Some of these nucleotide deletions and insertions are common for both contemporary strains in reference to the prototype strain, while others are observed in only one of the strains compared to the prototype strain. Similarity percentages between the HCoV-OC43 BE03 and BE04 strains, the ATCC prototype strain and the HCoV-OC43 Paris isolate are calculated for the major open reading frames (ORFs) and their proteins (Table 1 ). In the 2003 strain, the lowest percentage of identities with the other HCoV-OC43 strains is found for the envelope protein (E) gene and the corresponding amino acid sequence. However, the low rate of similarity is not due to a high number of mutations but to a 6 nucleotide deletion at the 3Vend of the HCoV-OC43 BE03 E gene leading to the deletion of a stop codon. The ORF is thereby elongated until the next stop codon, which is present 14 base pairs (bp) downstream. The HCoV-OC43 BE03 E protein is therefore 4 amino acids longer than its HCoV-OC43 ATCC, BE04 and Paris counterparts. Sequencing of the E gene of the other HCoV-OC43 2003 strains demonstrated the same elongation of the E ORF.",

SimPlot analysis of the complete genomes of the HCoV-OC43 BE03 and BE04 strains, the Paris isolate and the HCoV-OC43 ATCC strain (AY585228) in reference to the ATCC prototype strain (AY391777), also demonstrates for the BE03 and BE04 strains that the highest variability is found in the genome region containing the spike gene (Fig. 2 ). Most remarkably, the spike genes of the BE03 and BE04 strains, with detection dates only one year apart, show only 97.2% nucleotide and 96.9% amino acid similarity which corresponds to a total of 93 nucleotide variations leading to 34 amino acid changes, 15 nucleotide (or 5 amino acid) insertions in the BE03 strain spike gene and 9 nucleotide (or 3 amino acid) insertions in the BE04 strain spike gene. Out of 93 polymorphic nucleotides, 60 are located in the S1 subunit and these include 29 synonymous substitutions and 31 nonsynonymous substitutions leading to 23 amino acid changes. Nucleotide insertions and deletions are also exclusively found in the S1 subunit, which codes for the fragment of the spike glycoprotein that binds to its cellular receptor. The putative N-glycosylation pattern of the spike proteins of the contemporary strains also differs slightly between both strains and in comparison to that of the HCoV-OC43 prototype spike protein. There are 15 Fig. 2 . SimPlot analysis of complete genome sequence data of the HCoV-OC43 BE03, BE04, Paris, and ATCC (GenBank accession number AY585228) strains in reference to HCoV-OC43 ATCC strain GenBank accession number AY391777. Each point plotted is the percentage genetic distance within a sliding window of 600 bp wide, centered on the position plotted, with a step size of 100 bp. Each curve is a comparison between the genome of one of the strains and the reference genome of the ATCC HCoV-OC43 strain (AY391777). Among the strains sampled in the same year, a high degree of conservation is found in their spike genes: no more than 0.15% difference between the 2003 strains, and no more than 0.05% between the 2004 strains. A multiple sequence alignment of these sequence data and spike gene sequence data of HCoV-OC43 and of other group 2 coronaviruses, available in Genbank, is performed. Based on this alignment, a neighbor joining phylogenetic tree is constructed and evaluated by 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates (Fig. 3) . In the HCoV-OC43 branch, three phylogenetic clusters can clearly be demonstrated: the ATCC cluster, containing all ATCC strains as well as the Paris isolate, a second cluster containing all HCoV-OC43 BE03 strains, and a third cluster, in which all HCoV-OC43 BE04 strains are found. Molecular clock analysis is performed using the spike gene sequence data of HCoV-OC43 and BCoV strains for which the sampling date is known (Table 2) . A likelihood ratio test indicates that the molecular clock hypothesis, which assumes that the evolutionary rate is roughly constant among lineages, cannot be rejected for these serially sampled data (P = 0.62). Using a Bayesian coalescent approach, the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the HCoV-OC43 2003 and 2004 strains is estimated in 1971 with a 95% highest posterior density interval of 1962-1979. The evolutionary rate is estimated to be 3.5 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 substitutions per site per year (95% highest posterior density interval of 2.6 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 -4.5 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 ).",

            "text": "Human coronaviruses are an important cause of respiratory tract infections. Before the SARS outbreak coronaviruses have been somewhat neglected in human medicine, although they have always played a significant role in animal virology. Only recently, we reported the complete genome sequence of the prototype HCoV-OC43 strain (ATCC VR759; GenBank accession number AY391777) (Vijgen et al., 2005a) . This strain, however, has been passaged several times in organ culture, suckling mouse brain and cell culture, and the presence of culture-related polymorphisms is likely. In this study, we screened a collection of RSV-negative bronchiolitis samples in order to identify contemporary HCoV-OC43 strains and we determined the full-length genome sequence of two circulating strains (HCoV-OC43 BE03 and BE04) detected in 2003 and 2004, respectively. When comparing the complete genome sequence of the contemporary strains to that of the ATCC prototype strain and to the HCoV-OC43 Paris isolate, we found similarity percentages of 98.9% to 99.0%. The genetic divergence between each of the circulating strains and the ATCC strain corresponds roughly to an evolutionary rate of about 2.7 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 nucleotide substitutions per site per year. This value is consistent with the previously estimated evolutionary rate of the BCoV/HCoV-OC43 pair, and that of other coronaviruses (TGEV and SARS-CoV) (Salemi et al., 2004; Sanchez et al., 1992; Vijgen et al., 2005a) .",

            "text": "In reference to the prototype strain, in frame nucleotide insertions and deletions are present in the HE, S and E genes of the contemporary strains, leading to variability in their predicted protein lengths. HE, S and E proteins are expressed at the surface of the virus particles and host immune pressures can attribute to the occurrence of variations, insertions and deletions in their genes. Deletion of a stop codon at the 3Vend of the HCoV-OC43 E gene of the BE03 strain elongates this ORF with 12 bp or 4 amino acids. The same elongation of the E ORF by deletion of a stop codon is also present in the other HCoV-OC43 strains Whether this E protein elongation has a functional significance remains to be elucidated. The spike gene and protein are the most polymorphic when comparing the major ORFs of the prototype and contemporary HCoV-OC43 strains. The spike glycoprotein is the major coronavirus antigen and plays an important role in attachment of the virus to cell surface receptors and induces the fusion of viral and cellular membranes (Spaan et al., 1988) . Host immunity escape mechanisms, variation in host range and tissue tropism of coronaviruses are largely attributed to variations in the spike glycoprotein (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001) . Interestingly, the similarity between the spike genes and proteins of the 2003 and 2004 circulating HCoV-OC43 strains is lower (97.2% and 96.9%, respectively) than would be expected based on the HCoV-OC43 evolutionary rate. The observed spike gene variability provides evidence for the existence of several genetically distinct HCoV-OC43 strains with different temporal and possible geographical circulation patterns. Spike gene sequencing of the additional 2003 and 2004 HCoV-OC43 strains reveals more characteristics of the HCoV-OC43 strains circulating in 2003 and 2004. All BE03 strains have a 4092-nt spike gene coding for a 1363-amino acid protein, while the spike gene of all BE04 strains is six nucleotides shorter encoding a 1361-amino acid protein. The HCoV-OC43 BE04 spike gene is of the same length as the HCoV-OC43 ATCC prototype strain spike gene, but shows a different nucleotide insertion and deletion pattern. Strain-specific nucleotide variations, insertions and deletions are present among all samples of the same year of detection. Phylogenetic analysis of spike gene sequences of these four Belgian BE03 and three Belgian BE04 HCoV-OC43 strains, of the HCoV-OC43 Paris isolate spike gene, and of all ATCC strain spike sequence data, confirms the existence of genetically different HCoV-OC43 strains. Three distinct phylogenetic clusters can be demonstrated: the ATCC cluster, containing all ATCC laboratory strains as well as the Paris isolate, a second cluster, containing all HCoV-OC43 BE03 strains, and a third cluster, in which all HCoV-OC43 BE04 strains are found (Fig. 3) . The HCoV-OC43 Paris isolate clusters with all ATCC strains and not with the contemporary strains, implicating that this isolate might not be a circulating strain, but rather a result of cross-contamination with the ATCC HCoV-OC43 strain (Vijgen et al., 2005b) . At a certain time in history the HCoV-OC43 2003 and 2004 circulating strains diverged from each other, and based on molecular clock analysis of spike gene sequence data, their most recent common ancestor can be dated back to 1971 (95% highest posterior density interval: 1962 -1979) . According to this molecular clock model, an evolutionary rate of 3.5 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 nucleotide substitutions per site per year is estimated (95% highest posterior density interval: 2.6 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 -4.5 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 ), a value consistent with our previous findings (Vijgen et al., 2005a) . The existence of two different HCoV-OC43 strains circulating in Belgium in 2003 and in 2004 is also supported by the difference in length of the E protein, which is four amino acids longer in the BE03 samples, while this elongation of the E ORF is not present in the BE04 samples.",

This cleavage process is believed to play an important, although not obligatory role in the fusion activity and viral infectivity of BCoV and MHV (Stauber et al., 1993; Storz et al., 1981) . In all BE03 and BE04 HCoV-OC43 strains, a glycine to arginine variation compared to all spike protein sequences of the ATCC HCoV-OC43 strain and the Paris isolate is present in this proteolytic cleavage site. This observation might have possible important functional consequences, as the cleavage site sequence is RRSRG in the ATCC strains and these have been reported to have an uncleaved spike protein (Hogue and Brian, 1986; K\u00fc nkel and Herrler, 1993) . All 2003 and 2004 contemporary strains, however, have a G to R amino acid change in the last position, leading to an RRSRR motif, identical to that of BCoV-Mebus, which therefore might lead to an increased cleavability compared to the ATCC prototype HCoV-OC43 spike protein. This amino acid change is also present in two HCoV-OC43 strains described by K\u00fc nkel and Herrler (1996) (OC43-CU and OC43-VA), which have been shown to be cleaved to an extent of nearly 40% in infected cells. Analysis of the spike gene of these two strains in comparison to the ATCC prototype HCoV-OC43 strains and to BCoV-Mebus reveals a closer relationship to BCoV than to the ATCC HCoV-OC43 strains.",

In both contemporary HCoV-OC43 strains, the I gene encodes a 207-amino acid protein, as is also observed in BCoV, PHEV and MHV (Fischer et al., 1997; Lapps et al., 1987) . In the HCoV-OC43 prototype strain, however, an early stop codon is present in the I coding region leading to two potential coding regions of 60 amino acids and 115 amino acids. The occurrence of this early stop codon is due to a single nucleotide variation, which probably occurred during cell culture passaging.",

The forward PCR primer in the 5V-terminal sequence (OC43F1: 5V-GATTGTGAGCGATTTGC-3V) was based on the HCoV-OC43 5VUTR partial sequence (Wu, H.Y., Guy, J.S., Yoo, D., Vlasak, R. and Brian, D.A., University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, unpublished; GenBank accession number AF523847). To generate RT-PCR products containing the exact 3V-terminal sequence, we used oligonucleotide OC43R74 (5V-TTTTTTTTTTGTGATTCTTCCA-3V) based on the conserved 3V-end sequence of all known group-2 coronaviruses. Using 150 sequencing primers, sequencing in both directions was performed on an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using the BigDye terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit. Chromatogram sequencing files were inspected with Chromas 2.2 (Technelysium, Helensvale, Australia), and contigs were prepared using SeqMan II (DNASTAR, Madison, WI).",
