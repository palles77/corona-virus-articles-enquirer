The last major international assessment of these impacts was made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1999. Here, a comprehensive updated assessment of aviation is provided. Scientific advances since the 1999 assessment have reduced key uncertainties, sharpening the quantitative evaluation, yet the basic conclusions remain the same. The climate impact of aviation is driven by long-term impacts from CO 2 emissions and shorter-term impacts from non-CO 2 emissions and effects, which include the emissions of water vapour, particles and nitrogen oxides (NO x ). The presentday radiative forcing from aviation (2005) is estimated to be 55 mW m \u00c02 (excluding cirrus cloud enhancement), which represents some 3.5% (range 1.3-10%, 90% likelihood range) of current anthropogenic forcing, or 78 mW m \u00c02 including cirrus cloud enhancement, representing 4.9% of current forcing (range 2-14%, 90% likelihood range). According to two SRES-compatible scenarios, future forcings may increase by factors of 3-4 over 2000 levels, in 2050. The effects of aviation emissions of CO 2 on global mean surface temperature last for many hundreds of years (in common with other sources), whilst its non-CO 2 effects on temperature last for decades. Much progress has been made in the last ten years on characterizing emissions, although major uncertainties remain over the nature of particles. Emissions of NO x result in production of ozone, a climate warming gas, and the reduction of ambient methane (a cooling effect) although the overall balance is warming, based upon current understanding. These NO x emissions from current subsonic aviation do not appear to deplete stratospheric ozone. Despite the progress made on modelling aviation's impacts on tropospheric chemistry, there remains a significant spread in model results. The knowledge of aviation's impacts on cloudiness has also improved: a limited number of studies have demonstrated an increase in cirrus cloud attributable to aviation although the magnitude varies: however, these trend analyses may be impacted by satellite artefacts. The effect of aviation particles on clouds (with and without contrails) may give rise to either a positive forcing or a negative forcing: the modelling and the underlying processes are highly uncertain, although the overall effect of contrails and enhanced cloudiness is considered to be a positive forcing and could be substantial, compared with other effects. The debate over quantification of aviation impacts has also progressed towards studying potential mitigation and the technological and atmospheric tradeoffs. Current studies are still relatively immature and more work is required to determine optimal technological development paths, which is an aspect that atmospheric science has much to contribute. In terms of alternative fuels, liquid hydrogen represents a possibility and may reduce some of aviation's impacts on climate if the fuel is produced in a carbon-neutral way: such fuel is unlikely to be utilized until a 'hydrogen economy'",

The introduction of biofuels as a means of reducing CO 2 impacts represents a future possibility. However, even over and above land-use concerns and greenhouse gas budget issues, aviation fuels require strict adherence to safety standards and thus require extra processing compared with biofuels destined for other sectors, where the uptake of such fuel may be more beneficial in the first instance.",

Over the last 15 years or so, there has been considerable activity investigating aviation's effects on the global atmosphere in national and international research programmes, including dedicated efforts for the IPCC (1999) report. Shortly before the completion of the IPCC (1999) assessment, Boeing announced that it no longer intended to pursue development of a large supersonic aircraft, largely on grounds of economics and noise impacts. In addition, the aeronautics program at NASA was folded into the space shuttle program. The pioneering dedicated research programmes by NASA into effects from both potential future supersonic fleets and subsonic aviation were terminated.",

These programmes include: PartEmis, NEPAIR, TRADEOFF, INCA, AERO2K, METRIC, SCENIC and CRYOPLANE (see Appendix I). The bulk of the efforts of these programmes were directed at subsonic effects/technology, with the exception of SCENIC and minor components of TRADEOFF. CRYOPLANE focussed on the potential for future liquid hydrogen (LH 2 ) powered aircraft. In addition, a number of other related European Fifth Framework Projects were initiated studying the nitrogen budget in the upper troposphere from natural sources, especially lightning (LINOX, EULINOX, TROCCINOX), which have been summarized by Schumann and Huntrieser (2007) . European Commission research efforts into aviation effects have continued through the Sixth Framework Integrated Project 'QUANTIFY', which runs until 2009. By convention, the interest in aviation's impacts on climate change and ozone depletion are thought to date back some 40 years to the late 1960s when the US and UK were developing ideas for supersonic aircraft and concerns were raised over stratospheric O 3 depletion (Johnston, 1971) . However, there is evidence dating back to the early 1960s of awareness that air traffic might modify climate through contrails (condensation trails) (Osmundsen, 1963) . The possibility that aviation might affect tropospheric O 3 and climate appears to have been first considered during the early stratospheric assessments undertaken in the US, UK and France in the early to mid 1970s (e.g. the CIAP, COMESA and COVOS programmes) with the increasing recognition that tropospheric O 3 was a climate warming gas (Ramanathan and Dickinson, 1979; Wang et al., 1980; Lacis and WuebblesLogan, 1990) . The earliest paper that identifies aircraft NO x increasing tropospheric O 3 is not clear but early literature includes , Hidalgo and Crutzen (1977) and Widhopf et al. (1977) following earlier recognition of a 'cross-over' from O 3 production from NO x in the troposphere to O 3 destruction in the stratosphere by Johnston and Quitevis (1974) .",

Subsequently, much research has been focussed over the last 10 years on contrails and cirrus cloud enhancement. The IPCC (1999) report pointed out that the potential contribution from subsonic aviation for a range of 2050 scenarios could be between 3 and 7% of total radiative forcing, excluding cirrus cloud enhancement (Chapter 6; Prather et al., 1999) . The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report considered aviation but only briefly: Working Group 1 (IPCC, 2007a) provided a short overview of literature on contrails and cirrus cloud enhancement (Chapter 2; Forster et al., 2007a) and Working Group 3 (IPCC, 2007b) reviewed technological mitigation potential (Chapter 5; Kahn-Ribeiro et al., 2007) .",

These may undergo condensation in the young plume leading to volatile aerosol particles and volatile coating of soot. Such particles, if large enough, may themselves act as condensation nuclei or may interact with soot to form condensation nuclei. The liquid droplets formed may freeze homogeneously and soot may act as nucleus for heterogeneous ice nucleation, and hence has an important role in the formation of contrails and perhaps even cirrus clouds. The ice nucleation properties of soot are sensitive to sulphuric acid coating (M\u00f6 hler et al., 2005) . Therefore, condensable gases present in a young exhaust plume are of considerable interest. Whereas contrail formation is insensitive to the particles and trace gases emitted (Schumann, 1996; Gierens, 2007a,b) , the optical properties of the contrails and the resultant cirrus changes are expected to depend on particle and trace gas emissions .",

All studies, including older ones (e.g. Spicer et al., 1994) have found that HC emissions are a strong function of engine power, decreasing with increasing thrust. At ground conditions, Yelvington et al. (2007) found that HC emissions decreased with increasing ambient temperature (range approximately 11-30 C). Measurements in engine exhaust have identified that HC emissions comprise a range of relatively light HCs (C 2 -C 6 ), including alkanes and alkenes, and formaldehyde, methanol, ethylene, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, benzene, toluene, phenol, styrene, naphthalene and methylnaphthalenes (Slemr et al., 2001; Knighton et al., 2007; Yelvington et al., 2007) . The EIs for the HC species measured tend to be quite variable even for the same approximate thrust conditions, depending upon engine and ambient temperature. There seems to be some evidence for a shift of speciation with thrust condition of the engine from a predominance of light HC species at lower thrust to heavier (C 4 plus) species at higher thrust (Anderson et al., 2006) . Knighton et al. (2007) report a scaling of speciation with thrust but they measured mostly higher (C 4 plus) HCs so that this result is not necessarily at odds with those of Anderson et al. (2006) . Some of the low volatility hydrocarbons are thought to be involved in aerosol formation and even more pronounced in aerosol growth on existing particle nuclei (Yu and Turco, 1999) . Low volatility hydrocarbons, including oxygenated hydrocarbons and organic acids have been identified (Kiendler et al., 2000a,b; Petzold et al., 2005a; Sorokin and Arnold, 2006) . The importance of condensable organic matter for particle growth was deduced from the large volume of volatile aerosol found in aircraft plumes even when the aircraft burned fuel with very low sulphur content (K\u00e4 rcher et al., 1998a; Yu and Turco, 1999; Schumann et al., 2002) .

Ground measurements sampling directly behind an engine show that primary NO 2 (i.e. directly emitted) represents up to 80% of the total NO x emissions for a modern engine at low powers, but this fraction decreases to 7% at the highest thrust setting . A study of airport operations indicated values of 28-35% (Herndon et al., 2004) but these values are subject to uncertainties of NO to NO 2 conversion in the plumes and an undefined range of operations at the airport. At cruise, a best-estimate of 0-15% was derived, and this value seems to be engine dependent (Schulte et al., 1997) . A combustion modelling study indicated that primary NO 2 may be of the order 25-50% for idle, and 1-9% for higher thrust conditions of take-off and climb out (Garcia-Naranjo and Wilson, 2005) .",

Most OH formed in the combustor is consumed by selfreaction or reactions with NO etc. before reaching the engine exit (B\u00f6 ckle et al., 1999) . The emission index of OH has been deduced from measured HONO, HNO 3 , NO, and NO 2 concentrations in exhaust plumes using a chemical model including plume dilution for a limited number of aircraft during the POLINAT campaigns , see Table 2 . The data include two cases of encounters with plumes of B747s at cruise, which were studied in detail by Tremmel et al. (1998) for which OH emission indices of 0.32-0.39 g kg \u00c01 (fuel) which corresponds to an OH concentration at the combustor exit of 9.0-14.4 ppmv or 0.3-0.7 ppmv at the engine exit: these are similar to previous results obtained by measurements in the plume of a Concorde and ER-2 (Hanisco et al., 1997) . Direct measurements of OH were made behind an engine simulator rig in the European PartEmis project using laser induced fluorescence (LIF) but yielded much lower values w2 \u00c2 10 10 molecules cm \u00c03 (1.2 ppbv) than implied by the plume encounters. This large discrepancy may be caused by consumption of OH already between the combustor and the engine exit. This difference is important since the OH radical is indirectly involved in aerosol formation by producing gaseous H 2 SO 4 (Gleitsmann and Zellner, 1999; Starik et al., 2004) , which is an efficient aerosol precursor; and, the formation of HNO 3 and HNO 2 are the principle sink terms in the plume for emitted OH. Thus, estimates of the initial conversion of SO 2 to H 2 SO 4 and the initial fraction of NO z (HNO 3 , HNO 2 , PAN etc.) are dependent upon initial assumed OH emissions. This latter aspect may have implications for studies that attempt to estimate regional/global O 3 production, accounting for initial conversion of NO x in the plume (e.g. Kraab\u00f8l et al., 2000a Kraab\u00f8l et al., ,b, 2002 since ppm levels of OH were assumed.",

Measurements of SO 2 in aircraft exhaust plumes have been found to be consistent with average fuel sulphur contents Schumann et al., 1998; Hunton et al., 2000) . According to models, fuel sulphur is oxidized mainly to SO 2 in the combustor (Brown et al., 1996) . In the turbine, a small fraction, 3, of SO 2 experiences further oxidation by O atoms leading to SO 3 . Additional SO 2 oxidation via OH radicals takes place downstream of the combustor exit but mostly still upstream of the engine exit plane (Tremmel and Schumann, 1999) . Via reaction with water vapour, SO 3 becomes converted to gaseous H 2 SO 4 mostly at plume ages of less than 10 ms (Reiner and Arnold, 1993) . The consequences of more recent findings on the SO x kinetics has still to be evaluated (Blitz et al., 2003; Somnitz et al., 2005; Yilmaz et al., 2006; Hindiyarti et al., 2007; Rasmussen et al., 2007) . Gaseous H 2 SO 4 has a very low vapour pressure and likely represents the most important aerosol precursor. Hence, the conversion fraction of fuel sulphur to H 2 SO 4 is an important parameter. Gaseous H 2 SO 4 was detected in fuel combustion experiments in the laboratory and in jet engine exhaust at groundlevel (Frenzel and Arnold, 1994) and during combustor testing within PartEmis . Direct measurements of H 2 SO 4 in aircraft exhaust plumes at cruising altitudes were performed using a chemical ionisation mass spectrometry instrument (Curtius et al., 1998 . The various measurements yielded values of 3 between 0.3 and 3.3 AE 1.8% Schumann et al., 2002; Katragkou et al., 2004; Petzold et al., 2005a) .",

A small fraction of the SO 3 is formed in the combustor but most is formed inside the engine between the combustor and engine exit (Starik et al., 2002; Sorokin et al., 2004) . The H 2 SO 4 is formed mainly at the end and outside of the engine. A budget analysis of S-containing species in particulate matter emitted from the PartEmis combustor yielded a partitioning of 97% SO 2 , 2.7% gaseous H 2 SO 4 , and <0.3% chemisorbed at soot particle surface (Petzold et al., 2005a) . Upper bounds of 3 of about 1.8-10% (depending on engine and the fuel sulphur content) can be derived from a combination of these direct measurements with aerosol measurements and models .

Details are engine dependent (Brundish et al., 2007; Dakhel et al., 2007) . Larger agglomerates may grow up to sizes larger than 100 nm in diameter. Soot emissions from aircraft engines are specified by ICAO in terms of smoke number measurements, which is a filter stain reference method. Correlations between smoke number and soot mass concentration were used to estimate the mean mass emission index of black carbon by the globally aircraft fleet in 1992 to be 0.04 g kg \u00c01 (Petzold and D\u00f6 pelheuer, 1998; Petzold et al., 1999) . More modern engines such as the CFM56-3B1 on a B737 emit much less, 0.01 g soot kg \u00c01 fuel. The average black carbon (BC) emission factor decreases with altitude from about 0.08 g kg \u00c01 at altitudes near take-off and landing to 0.02 g kg \u00c01 at 16 km . The 2002 fleet average computed from such correlations in AERO2K results in 0.025 g kg \u00c01 . Of the order of 10 14 -10 15 kg \u00c01 soot particles are emitted depending on engine type and power setting (Petzold et al., 1999) . In total, improvement of aircraft engine technology from 1960s technology to today results in a decrease of soot mass emissions by a factor of 40, see Fig. 1 .",

For take-off conditions, this fraction may increase up to > 90%, while for idle conditions it may be as low as 10% .

The specific surface area of the microporous soot was 75 m 2 g \u00c01 for combustor soot, and 64 m 2 g \u00c01 for a laboratory prepared kerosene soot. Different from graphitic black carbon, combustor soot particles appear to be hydrophilic before reaching water saturation and may therefore serve as nuclei for water condensation without prior activation (Chughtai et al., 1999; Popovicheva and Starik, 2007) . A joint analysis of hygroscopic growth measurements , chemical analysis and cloud condensation activation measurements obtained during PartEmis quantifies the increase in soot particle activation to cloud condensation nuclei from pure soot acting almost like an insoluble graphitic particle towards easily activated sulphuric acid coated particles (Petzold et al., 2005a,b) . A sulphur coating of 3% by volume of soot particles reduces the diameter required for cloud condensation nuclei activation by a factor of 2 compared with pure graphite particles. The relationship between soot particle emission index and fuel sulphur content from a number of aircraft campaigns in contrail situations is shown in Fig. 2 .",

The model assumes that the number of CIs available determines the number of volatile particles formed. The amount of sulphuric acid (depending on fuel sulphur content and the conversion efficiency, 3) and the amount of condensable organic matter together control the size of the particles formed. Coagulation and dilution control the time scales of particle growth. Using this model, the measured apparent emission indices can be normalized to a given plume age (3 s), emission index of low volatility hydrocarbons (20 mg g \u00c01 ), and cut-off size of the particle counters (5 nm).",

The positive and negative CIs can be very massive (exceeding 8500 atomic mass unit), even for nearly sulphur-free fuel (2 mg g \u00c01 ) . The fractional abundances (in the range 0.2-0.7) of CIs with mass numbers >8500 atomic mass unit were found to increase with fuel sulphur content and to be larger for negative CIs than for positive ones. Probably the growth of these CIs involves organic trace gases. If composed mostly of an H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O mixture, a CI with a mass number of 8500 would have a diameter of about 3 nm, which is comparable to the size-detection limit of present condensation nucleus particle counters.

Gridded inventories are usually calculated for the purposes of providing input to chemical transport models (CTMs) or combined CTM/Global Climate Models (sometimes referred to as Chemistry Climate Models or CCMs). In addition, such inventories may be used for more policy-oriented analyses such as the calculation of allocation of international emissions under different assumptions (e.g. Lee et al., 2005; Owen and Lee, 2006) . The emissions calculated may include NO x , CO 2 , SO 2 , particles, H 2 O, CO and HCs. In addition, gridded distance flown may be calculated as an input to contrail/ cirrus models. Emissions of NO x , CO and HCs do not scale directly with fuel usage and specific fuel-flow correlation algorithms are applied. For NO x , the commonly used method is either the DLR-2 fuel flow method (Deidewig et al., 1996) or the Boeing Fuel Flow Method-2 (Baughcum et al., 1996) . Whilst some inventories calculate CO and HCs, these have been shown to be unimportant for chemical impacts in the UT/LS, since the magnitude is so small compared with other sources (Hayman and Markiewicz, 1996) .",

There are a number of reasons for this: the core data for movements for all inventories is the OAG ('Official Airline Guide', www.oag. com) database of scheduled movements -non-scheduled movements need to be either estimated or calculated from 'real' (flight plan, radar) data. However, this is not a straightforward task, neither is the subtraction of the scheduled data from the total data. For regions where neither flight plan nor radar data are available, non-scheduled data are often estimated Kim et al., 2007) . For some regions where there is significant aviation activity, e.g. Russia and China, there is anecdotal evidence that schedules are under-reported. Inventories may, or may not, include some estimation or explicit calculation of non-idealized routing, or simply use great-circle distances. The incorporation of the wide range of aircraft is often simplified, so that one aircraft may represent a number of others; for others, data may simply not be available. General aviation is usually excluded (i.e. small aircraft flying under visual flight rules). Comparative exercises are currently underway between the SAGE, FAST, AERO2K and AEM (a EUROCONTROL model) under the auspices of the activities of the International Civil Aviation Organization's Committee for Aviation Environmental Protection (ICAO-CAEP) and it is proving difficult to identify and quantify these sources of uncertainty. CAEP is attempting to provide a unified aircraft movements database (the Common Operational Database), as somewhat surprisingly, ICAO does not appear to quantify/record global aviation movements. However, even compiling the Common Operational Database is proving to be a challenge because of the sheer volume of data that need to be checked and verified.",

The only published estimation of a time-series of aviation emissions dating back to the beginning of significant aviation activities (1940) is that of Sausen and Schumann (2000) , whose estimations were also used in the IPCC (1999) assessment. Sausen and Schumann (2000) used International Energy Agency (IEA) statistics of kerosene fuel sales; this was recently updated from 1995 to 2005 by Lee et al. (2009) . A comparison of IEA data with 'bottom up' inventory methodologies reveals a discrepancy which indicates a systematic underestimation of emissions by the inventories, which is the result of a number of assumptions and systematic biases, outlined above. This underestimation has been known for some time (Schumann, 1994) but it remains difficult to reconcile all the known differences . Nonetheless, it is critical that total historical CO 2 emissions are used in RF calculations, such that usage of the IEA data remains most suited to this purpose.",

The scenarios developed for HSCTs represent a technology that does not yet exist but one that might yet be developed and thus represent a quite different set of assumptions from other long-term scenarios, which only consider continued development of a subsonic fleet. For this reason, the range of emissions, fleet size, and cruise altitude covered by supersonic scenarios was larger than for subsonic aircraft. More recently, research has been initiated by a number of manufacturers to develop a supersonic business jet (SSBJ) although no prototype has yet been produced and concrete plans are scant in detail.

The interaction of atmospheric transport and chemistry plays a crucial role in determining the impact of aircraft emissions. At mid-latitudes, aircraft fly in the UT/LS region, where the general circulation transports air masses predominantly downwards into the troposphere on a timescale of weeks, with a pronounced seasonal cycle. The enhanced convective activity in summer largely reduces the turnover time of species in the upper troposphere. At lower latitudes, the Hadley circulation impacts the dispersion of emitted compounds, i.e. into the lower troposphere in the subsidence region and to higher altitudes in the convergence zone. In the subsidence region, clear sky-conditions enhance photochemistry, whereas the upwelling areas are characterized by deep convective clouds, where large fractions of soluble species are washed out.",

            "text": "An understanding of the transport pathways of aircraft emitted species is important since they determine where compounds accumulate and hence control the chemical fate of species. Danilin et al. (1998) compared results from 2-D and 3-D global models, simulating an artificial 'aircraft-fuel' tracer, having an e-folding loss rate of 5 days in the troposphere. Rogers et al. (2002a) similarly investigated the transport characteristics of inert tracers localized in various UT/LS regions among models to understand better transport related model differences. Both studies indicated a large variability amongst the models. Schoeberl and Morris (2000) applied an experimental set-up comparable to that of Danilin et al. (1998) but applied a non-diffusive Lagrangian transport scheme. They concluded that a large fraction of the disagreement among models might arise from numerical diffusion by the transport scheme. Especially, a perturbation of the stratosphere above the emission region, i.e. in the 'middle world' 3 was not found. This finding was confirmed by Grewe et al. (2002a,b) , who applied a Lagrangian transport scheme in a global chemistry-climate model. In this modelling study, 10,000 particles in the main aircraft emission region were released and showed that the predominant transport pathway is directed downward and an impact on the middle world was only found for trajectories directed towards the tropics followed by uplift. However, transport timescales were found to be greater than those of washout, implying a negligible impact from subsonic aircraft emissions upon the stratosphere. It has been shown by a number of model developers that detailed vertical model resolution is necessary in order to capture gradients of measured species in the UT/LS satisfactorily (Brasseur et al., 1998; Land et al., 2002; Roeckner et al., 2006) . O'Connor et al. (2005) compared different vertical resolutions of a Eulerian CTM with measurements and demonstrated an improvement with better resolution; a Lagrangian scheme was also utilized but was not without its own problems and required a representation of mixing to reproduce the measurements. Similarly, Grewe et al. (2002a,b) showed that a sufficiently high model resolution at tropopause altitudes was necessary to maintain correct ozone gradients at the tropopause. With the higher vertical resolution, no stratospheric perturbation from subsonic aircraft emissions was found.",

They found that 'streamers' (a filament of low-latitude air from a breaking Rossby wave event) and low specific humidity events were better represented at higher horizontal resolutions with a slightly improved vertical representation of O 3 profiles. A study of lightning NO x chemistry and transport in the UT/LS similarly showed that a good representation of cross-tropopause transport was important for chemical budgets (Grewe et al., 2004) . In a study of sensitivities to vertical and horizontal resolutions of the ECHAM5 climate model, Roeckner et al. (2006) found improvements from both changes and suggested that these should be made on a consistent basis. These aforementioned studies, although not applied to aircraft emissions, have potentially important implications for chemical budgets of perturbations brought about by such emissions.",

An increase in concentrations of NO x of 30-40% is found in the main flight corridors (for other model results see below). The additional NO x in these regions lead to an enhancement of reaction (4). Hence, HO 2 decreases in that area, whilst O 3 production increases. Because of the greater insolation, the maximum O 3 production is shifted towards lower latitudes. Ozone production is also shifted to lower altitudes with respect to the NO x changes, because HO 2 abundance, as one factor for O 3 production (eq. (3)) decreases with height between the UT/LS region and w500 hPa. The shift in the HO x partitioning towards OH from reaction (4) also leads to a decrease in the O 3 loss via reaction (6), which is not compensated by reaction (5). Both effects, i.e. the increase in O 3 production and the decrease in O 3 loss, lead to an increase of the net O 3 production rate resulting in an O 3 increase of approximately 3% in the Northern Hemisphere, which in turn leads to an increased O 3 loss rate via reactions (6) and (7). This secondary effect is visible especially in the lower atmosphere ( Fig. 10) . Hence, three different regimes (R) may be distinguished with respect to air traffic induced O 3 changes (Grewe et al., 2002a,b) : RNO y , where O 3 production is controlled by increased NO x and reaction (4); RHO 2 , where O 3 loss is decreased due to a decrease in HO 2 via reaction (6) and RO 3 , where O 3 loss is increased due to an increase in O 3 concentrations via reactions (5) and (6) Stevenson et al. (2004) point to a fourth regime close to the Earth's surface, where the additional HO 2 reacts with NO from other sources to form HNO 3 , which is easily washed out. This reduces the O 3 production (Region RPO 3 ).",

Their signal is too low compared with natural variability to be detected through measurements. However, for some circumstances, e.g. a stagnant high pressure system, the identification of air traffic induced ozone changes might be possible, since dispersion is reduced (Schlager et al., 1999) . Note that the lifetime of atmospheric chemical perturbations depend on the times of the chemical modes excited by the perturbing species and not by the lifetime of that species (Prather, 1994 (Prather, , 1996 .

In general, 2 types of ACMs are in use: CTMs, which are driven by meteorological data from forecast systems, and CCMs which calculate meteorological parameters by solving the primitive equations.

(2006) and Waugh and Eyring (2008) within the Chemistry-Climate Model Validation (CCMVal) Activity for WCRP's (World Climate Research Programme) SPARC (Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate) project. Stevenson et al. (2006) compared output from 26 models with ozone sonde data showing that the mean model results closely resembled the observational data with a slight overestimation of O 3 in the northern hemisphere winter resulting in an underestimation of the amplitude of the northern hemisphere seasonal cycle. Brunner et al. (2003 Brunner et al. ( , 2005 utilized measurements from aircraft campaigns, integrated in the ETHmeg database (http://www.megdb.ethz.ch/), for a direct point-by-point (in time and space) comparison with CTM model output. For the North Atlantic, the model results ( Fig. 11) showed an underestimation of some species, e.g. NO. The overall correlation is around 0.7. However, models performing well in comparison with a certain campaign often failed with another campaign and vice versa (Brunner et al., 2005) . This implies that whilst a single model may legitimately be used to calculate impacts of this nature, an ensemble of models will give more reliable results for an assessment (such as that of IPCC, 1999; Gauss et al., 2006; Stevenson et al., 2006) . Similarly, the assessment of stratosphericresolving CCMs (Eyring et al., 2006; Waugh and Eyring, 2008) shows that there is variability in the ability of CCMs to simulate different key processes, which may have ramifications for any assessments of HSCT scenarios requiring stratospheric models.",

Clearly, the NO x frequency distribution differs, since smaller-scale NO x enhancements are not represented in coarse model distributions. However, the seasonal cycle of NO x and O 3 is reproduced well by the E39/C model, with a broader distribution and the most frequent occurrence at larger mixing ratios.

The IPCC showed that global O 3 increases scaled almost linearly with increasing NO x emission rates (from different emission scenarios). Rogers et al. (2002b) showed this phenomenon, with some evidence of a decline in pO 3 with greater emission rates. This behaviour was also in evidence, where pO 3 vs. NO x emission was examined by latitude band showing that pO 3 increased at a much greater rate in low background NO x environments. Grewe (2007) analysed a transient model simulation from 1960 to 1999 with increasing air traffic emissions along with changing background conditions, i.e. increasing background NO x levels. The increase in O 3 relative to the air traffic emissions scaled almost linearly. However, a reduction in O 3 production efficiency can be observed (Fig. 13b ), when comparing model simulations for different time horizons for consistent emission values. Table 6 gives a comparison of such model approaches (Isaksen et al., 2001; Grewe et al., 2002a,b; Grewe, 2007) , by taking the 1990s ratio between O 3 increase and air traffic NO x emissions on a relative basis Table 5 Tropospheric ozone budget derived from a multi model analysis (Stevenson et al., 2006: S06) and from the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR), IPCC (2001) . STE inf describes the ozone influx from the stratosphere derived by STE inf \u00bc L \u00fe D \u00c0 P. The TAR best estimate of STE based on observations was much less than the model mean. a Note that this is the budget lifetime of CH 4 in the participating models and note the residence time of a CH 4 perturbation, which is estimated to be 12 yr.",

This efficiency in enhancing O 3 mass depends on the O 3 production efficiency and the O 3 lifetime. Grewe (2007) analysed the tropospheric O 3 lifetime between 1960 and 1999 and found a decrease from 30 to 26 days, which does not explain the low enhancement efficiency in the 1960s (Table 6 ).

            "text": "It should be noted that the O 3 lifetime is not constant throughout the troposphere and can vary widely with latitude, season, and altitude. It could shorter in other models or future simulations (Table 5) , which may lead to 25% larger OPEs. However, the general picture is unchanged. Fig. 13 shows the OPE for the various model experiments. The TRADEOFF simulations show an OPE in the range of 12-18 molecules of O 3 per emitted NO molecule. In the transient simulation from 1960 to 1999 (Grewe, 2007) a clear increase in the OPE from 11 molecules of O 3 per emitted NO molecule in 1960 to around 55 molecules around 1992 was observed. Afterwards, a clear decrease occurred, i.e. each additionally emitted NO molecule produced fewer O 3 molecules. The total O 3 production is largely determined by the background NO x levels (Lin et al., 1988; Grooss et al., 1998; Jaegl\u00e9 et al., 2000) . With respect to global mean values, Fig. 14 shows a sketch of the relationship between NO x concentration and net O 3 production with an inflexion around 1992. The 2050 values are still below the maximum O 3 production. 5.3.2.5. Seasonal effects. Some models show a 'double peak' structure in the air traffic O 3 perturbation, with maximum impacts in early summer (May) and autumn (October), whereas others only show one of those peaks (Hoor et al., 2009; Berntsen et al., 2003; K\u00f6 hler et al., 2008) . Mid latitude air traffic emissions have a weak maximum in summer/autumn and a minimum in winter (Schmitt and Brunner, 1997; Eyers et al., 2005) . However, the accumulation of NO x emitted by air traffic is largely reduced in summer because of intense vertical mixing (convection), which helps to explain the nature of the double peaks. Since the interaction between transport and chemistry varies amongst the models, these peaks are simulated differently. The atmospheric transport study of Rogers et al. (2002a) offers an explanation for these model differences: the model with the weakest vertical mixing for mid latitude emissions (their 'case T2', TOMCAT model) shows larger accumulations of NO x during summer and hence maximum air traffic induced ozone changes in October, compared with the model with the largest vertical mixing (E39/C), which shows the peak in late spring. 5.3.2.6. Interannual variability. Natural climate variability also has an impact on atmospheric mixing, oxidation capacity, and chemical transformation rates, which leads to variations in the pattern of the O 3 increase from air traffic. However, only the impact on global O 3 has been analysed in more detail. Grewe et al. (1999) calculated an inter-annual variability of AE6%, AE8%, AE12%, AE16% for the O 3 response in 1992, 2015, and 2050 (low and high emission scenario) applying the ECHAM3/CHEM model. The revised model version E39/C led to lower values of around AE2% for 1992 and 2015 (Grewe et al., 2002a,b) . 5.3.2.7. Impact of non-methane hydrocarbon and acetone chemistry. A number of studies have shown that the inclusion of NMHC chemistry in global models can significantly modify the net O 3 Fig. 13 . Globally integrated ozone response [DU] relative to aircraft NO x emissions (Tg N yr \u00c01 ) for a number of model simulations (A) and, the ozone production efficiency (OPE, the number of ozone molecules produced per emitted NO x molecule) (B).

Since individual tropospheric ozone lifetimes were not available, this was assumed to be 28 days for all models (see discussion in text).",

Results from the OsloCTM2 are based on Isaksen et al., 2001 . Results for ECHAM/CHEM are based on Grewe (2007) for the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s; Grewe et al. (2002a) production rates in the lower and free troposphere (e.g. Roelofs and Lelieveld, 2000) . Two effects are important with regard to NMHC chemistry: firstly, NMHC compounds react with OH and O 2 and enhance HO 2 formation ( Fig. 9 ) and hence O 3 production. Secondly, the counteracting effect of peroxyacetyl radicals (from photolysed higher oxygenated NMHC compounds) is to react with NO 2 to form PAN, which can be transported over long distances in the upper troposphere until it subsides and thermally decomposes. Therefore, NO x is converted into PAN, which reduces O 3 production via reaction (4). Br\u00fc hl et al. (2000) showed in box model simulations for the North Atlantic Flight Corridor that acetone concentrations significantly enhanced O 3 production induced by aircraft NO x emissions. The consequences on global scales were investigated by Kentarchos and Roelofs (2002) by applying the climate chemistry model ECHAM4-CBM4, which in principle confirmed the findings of Br\u00fc hl et al. They investigated the effect of the inclusion of NMHC chemistry on the calculated impact of current aircraft NO x emissions on tropospheric O 3 levels. In the upper troposphere they found a decrease of NO x owing to the formation of PAN and consequently an increase in HO 2 of 20%, which leads to a lower background O 3 formation since less NO 2 is produced via reaction (4). Globally, they concluded that when NMHC chemistry was included in their model chemistry, the aircraft-induced O 3 perturbations were greater by w12% in summer and the aircraft-induced O 3 production efficiency per NO x molecule increased by w20% compared with a simulation without higher hydrocarbon chemistry. Thus, future evolution of surface NMHC emissions may have an impact on UT O 3 production from aircraft NO x (Kentarchos and Roelofs, 2002) .",

Because of the very small size of aircraft-generated particles and since emissions mostly occur at mid-latitudes, the relevant heterogeneous reactions are essentially hydrolysis of N 2 O 5 and BrONO 2 (Meilinger et al., 2002) . The main effect of these two reactions is twofold: (a) NO x enhancements by NO x aircraft emissions are partly counterbalanced by additional heterogeneous conversion of NO x into HNO 3 on these particles in the flight corridors; (b) this reduced NO x enhancement tends to increase the amount of reactive Cl and Br in the mid to high latitudes UT/LS region, since less Cl/Br can be stored into Cl and Br nitrates, which enhances O 3 depletion via catalytic Cl and Br cycles.",

Direct particle emissions are estimated to account for 4-15% of the overall aircraft emitted sulphur (Curtius et al., 1998; Fahey et al., 1995) . However, in these older studies much larger values of 3 were estimated than are believed to be correct from more recent measurements and modelling studies (see Section 3.2). These direct particle emissions do not significantly change aerosol mass and extinction but may substantially increase surface area density (SAD) in the Northern Hemisphere UTLS. Release of gas phase SO 2 , on the other hand, may increase the net production of H 2 SO 4 , thus enhancing the sulphate mass in the accumulation mode and consequently, the direct RF. It also may increase the gas phase contribution to SAD, in the range of 25% of the change produced by direct plume particle emission (Pitari et al., 2002b; Weisenstein et al., 1998) . Pitari et al. (2002b) quantified the subsonic aircraft impact on UT/LS H 2 SO 4 aerosol SAD and its subsequent impact on aircraft induced O 3 perturbation. The calculated zonal mean aircraft SAD had a maximum of approximately 0.6-0.8 mm 2 cm \u00c03 at current subsonic cruise altitudes and poleward of 30 N. This change is roughly consistent with that calculated by K\u00e4 rcher and Meilinger (1998) under comparable conditions, i.e. assuming an average background SAD of 3 mm 2 cm \u00c03 (Thomason et al., 1997) , scaling their EI-SO 2 to 1.1 g kg \u00c01 , and assuming a 25% additional aircraft contribution to SAD from gas phase SO 2 emissions; this results in an SAD of 0.7 mm 2 cm \u00c03 . The model predicted a SAD increase above the source region which was qualitatively consistent with the results of the tracer fuel experiment described by Danilin et al. (1998) .",

Both models showed O 3 increases from air traffic NO x emissions when gas phase chemistry and background heterogeneous chemistry were considered only. The inclusion of heterogeneous reactions on aircraft-induced aerosols led to O 3 losses in the lowermost stratosphere of about \u00c04 to \u00c06 ppbv, as an annual average at approximately 14 km altitude and poleward of about 50 N, and to a reduction of the upper tropospheric O 3 increase (by about 2 ppbv). Pitari et al. (2002b) concluded that the lower stratosphere O 3 losses were caused by a decrease in NO x via heterogenous reactions on aircraft perturbed SAD, followed by an increase in Br and Cl radicals, increasing O 3 destruction. The reduced O 3 levels were then transported downwards compensating to some extent the O 3 increase from aircraft NO x emissions.",

Reichardt et al. (1996) noted low O 3 levels associated with mid-latitude tropospheric ice clouds. Peterson and Honrath (2001) made measurements of destruction of O 3 in snowpack interstitial air and suggested that this might be in operation in cirrus clouds. However, the general impact of these reactions on background O 3 can serve as an indicator as to how important these reactions may be. This was estimated by Von Kuhlmann and Lawrence (2006) , who applied the CTM MATCH. They estimated a maximum O 3 reduction of 4% and 7% in the tropical upper troposphere in a case in which Langmuir theory was applied and a maximum HNO 3 uptake scenario (extreme case), respectively. However, in the region where maximum air traffic O 3 changes occur, those values were reduced to 3-5% O 3 reduction, implying that the impact of heterogeneous reactions on ice particles is likely to be of minor importance to air traffic O 3 changes. However, this depends critically on the distribution and abundance of cirrus clouds and this should be examined more carefully.",

Global atmospheric chemistry models have a spatial and temporal resolution that does not resolve chemical processes in the wake vortex and subsequent dispersion regime of an aircraft plume. Air traffic emissions are therefore treated as being instantaneously dispersed in a grid cell in global models. However, in reality, emitted species are confined in the plume and the composition may evolve differently. In order to account for this difference two approaches have been taken. Box or Gaussian plume models have been used to calculate either effective emissions indices (e.g. Karol et al., 1997; Petry et al., 1998) or emission conversion factors (Kraab\u00f8l et al., 2000a,b; Meijer, 2001; Plumb et al., 2003) . In the first approach, factors are applied to the emission inventory to mimic concentration changes that occur resulting from the difference between a simulation with a plume model and one with instantaneous mixing. In the second approach, all relevant species (not only emitted once) experience changes which depend on the emission strength, atmospheric conditions (e.g. stability, shear, temperature, time of day etc.). These changes are pre-calculated as in the first approach with Gaussian plume models.",

            "text": "In general, the high OH concentrations in the plume lead to faster conversion into HONO and HNO 3 , so that all applied plume models emit less NO x and more HONO/HNO 3 . Kraab\u00f8l et al. (2002a,b ) estimated a decrease in the O 3 perturbation of 15-18% locally. Globally integrated (e.g. as in Fig. 13a ), this leads to an O 3 decrease of around 10%, whereas in a similar approach, Plumb et al. (2003) found a decrease of less than 3%. However, it is not clear whether Plumb et al. (2003) accounted for initial plume chemistry, as their results refer to 'background atmosphere' effects. Meijer et al. (1997) reported similar plume impacts on aircraft induced O 3 perturbations to Kraab\u00f8l et al. (2002a,b) ; however, when they included O 3 conversion factors, i.e. similar to Kraab\u00f8l et al. the changes were reduced to 0-5% in January and \u00c05 to 10% in July such that an increase in O 3 was found in summer. Hence, all studies concluded that the inclusion of plume processes reduce the annual and global mean O 3 increase from air traffic by maximum of approximately 10%. Where detailed chemical models are used (or data from underlying studies that use such models), the assumed initial emissions concentrations of OH are of the order 10 ppm (e.g. K\u00e4 rcher, 1996; Tremmel et al., 1998) . The emission of OH will strongly control the initial conversion of NO x to NO y species in the plume, particularly HNO 3 . However, more recent measurements (see Section 3.2.3 and Wilson et al., 2004) do not support such large OH concentrations and suggest levels of the order 1-10 ppb. This will have an influence on the global model studies that attempt to account for this factor, probably reducing the O 3 reduction. 5.3.2.10. Impact of background emissions. As has been outlined above, background emissions (e.g. industry, lightning, etc.) have a large impact on the tropospheric NO x concentrations and hence overall O 3 production since the chemistry is non-linear, as shown from measurements (e.g. Jaegl\u00e9 et al., 1998) . Grewe et al. (2002a) used surface NO x emissions of 31.1 Tg N for 1992 and updated the surface emissions by using 40.0 Tg N for 1992, which increased the aircraft induced ozone perturbation by 50%. Similar sensitivities have been found previously with regard to both strength and regional pattern of background emissions. This indicates the importance of accurately simulating the background atmospheric conditions. In the TRADEOFF and QUANTIFY projects, the emission scenarios were constrained for all models, which led to considerably lower model-to-model differences than for other multi-modelling studies (e.g. AEROCHEM2). Lightning emissions of NO x are estimated to have a magnitude of the order 5 Tg N yr \u00c01 (e.g. Schumann and Huntrieser, 2007: 5 AE 3 Tg N yr \u00c01 ; Boersma et al., 2005: 1.1-6.7 Tg N yr \u00c01 ) with large uncertainties (Labrador et al., 2005) . However, they also partly occur, like air traffic emissions, in the UT, where they have a larger impact on O 3 than surface emissions of NO x . Modelling studies suggest that an increase in lightning emissions from 5 to 10 Tg N yr \u00c01 (the upper end of this range may be unrealistic), decreases the air traffic O 3 perturbation by between 15 and 50% Brasseur et al., 1996) from the lower OPE at greater background levels of NO x . Moreover, in a number of studies, it has been found that the type of parameterization and vertical lightning emission profile also has an impact on the O 3 perturbation (e.g. Tie et al., 2002; Grewe et al., 2002a,b; Labrador et al., 2005) , which was found to be of the order 20% by Grewe et al. (2002a,b) but larger by others (Labrador et al., 2005) . 5.3.2.11. Climate-chemistry interactions. Two aspects are of interest with regard to climate-chemistry interactions. Firstly, aviationinduced changes in the chemical composition lead to changes in radiative forcing and climate parameters, which in turn may change the aircraft-induced chemical perturbations. However, these changes are too small to produce a significant feedback on the perturbations . Note that this may change in the case of supersonic transport (see below). Secondly, future climate change (warming of the atmosphere) will alter atmospheric characteristics and may change the impact of aviation emissions: climate change is likely to result in greater H 2 O and hence OH concentrations, but also different HNO 3 wash-out patterns and strengths (e.g. Johnson et al., 1999; Grewe et al., 2001) . However, these results are affected by the climate sensitivity assumed . Grewe et al. (1999) found that if the effects of climate change were included in a simulation, a decrease in air traffic (year 2015) induced O 3 perturbation of 10-15% resulted, mainly because of more efficient HNO 3 formation and removal. 5.3.3. Impact on methane 5.3.3.1. General impact. Emissions of NO x lead (see Fig. 9 ) to a repartitioning of HO x via reaction (6) in favour of OH, which enhances the oxidation of hydrocarbons, especially CH 4 by the reaction:",

            "text": "The effective residence time of O 3 and CH 4 perturbations differ considerably: one month vs. a decade. Therefore, the temporal evolution of O 3 and CH 4 changes due to air traffic emissions is very different. Stevenson et al. (2004) investigated the impact of an artificially magnified air traffic pulse emissions of 1-month-duration. The O 3 increases were found to be quite rapid, but declined in the third month (Fig. 15 ), whereas the CH 4 decrease was more persistent because of its longer lifetime. Stevenson et al. (2004) found that after approximately 6 months, O 3 changes were negligible but the CH 4 decreases persisted. This implies that less O 3 precursors are available and that the O 3 production decreases via reaction (4) leading to a slight O 3 decrease (Fig. 15 ). Table 7 gives a summary of the RF arising from changes in O 3 and CH 4 from aircraft NO x emissions. Since model studies were based on different emission scenarios with differing total emissions, the specific RF is highlighted, i.e. that relative to the annual aircraft NO x emissions, which focuses on the model's sensitivity between emission and RF rather than differences arising from different emission scenarios. The results show a specific RF of 36.9 AE 10.4 (mW m \u00c02 )/(Tg N yr \u00c01 ) for O 3 and \u00c023.2 AE 7.2 (mW m \u00c02 )/(Tg N yr \u00c01 ) for CH 4 , i.e. the standard deviation amounts to 30%. For all models, the absolute O 3 RF was larger than that for the CH 4 RF. The ratio is 1.65 AE 0.36 and shows a much smaller standard variation of around 20%, compared with individual forcings. Note that this number is dependent on the 3-D distribution of air traffic emissions and that regional changes could change this relationship. Specific RFs from the IPCC (1999) may be readily calculated, yielding 39.4 (mW m \u00c02 )/ (Tg N yr \u00c01 ) for O 3 and \u00c024.0 (mW m \u00c02 )/(Tg N yr \u00c01 ) for CH 4 with an absolute O 3 /CH 4 ratio of 1.64 (all 1992 conditions). The picture is somewhat complicated by the evident non-linearity of response, since future scenarios (2015, 2050) yield different results, with a declining rate of response for O 3 with higher NO x emissions, as might be expected. Results from the TRADEOFF project yielded 38.5 (mW m \u00c02 )/(Tg N yr \u00c01 ) for O 3 and 15.8(mW m \u00c02 )/(Tg N yr \u00c01 ) for CH 4. It appears that the specific RF for O 3 has decreased slightly over the last 10 years with model improvements; however, there is much variability in the results presented here (Table 7 ). In terms of specific forcing, O 3 RF from all sources (using IPCC, 2001 emissions and RF) is 6.7 (mW m \u00c02 )/ (Tg N yr \u00c01 ) for O 3 . Fig. 16 shows the impact of regional normalized emissions of NO x on O 3 and CH 4 RF; both show a clear latitudinal gradient with larger absolute RFs in the tropics . However, O 3 RF peaks for emissions in the upper troposphere, whereas CH 4 peaks in the mid troposphere. The ratio shows a maximum in the upper troposphere, with lower values at higher latitudes (Fig. 16c ). Surface emissions of NO x may even lead to a cooling (Wild et al., 2001) , which is indicated by values <1 in Fig. 16c . Since future air traffic is expected to increase at a greater rate in tropical regions, e.g. South East Asia, the ratio may increase.",

The use of annually varying meteorological analyses led to an inter-annual variability in the modelled transport of aircraft-emitted NO x and H 2 O from the North Atlantic flight corridor.

The zonal mean background distribution of N 2 O, used as a dynamical tracer, at an altitude of 32 km was studied by Rogers et al. (2000) as a function of the meteorological year (Fig. 18 , panel A). It should be noted that this altitude corresponds to the region of maximum potential O 3 loss from supersonic aircraft emissions. Large N 2 O values indicate regions of ascent (e.g. tropics), while smaller N 2 O values indicate regions of descent (e.g. high latitudes). Fig. 18 (panel A) shows the inter-annual variability of the N 2 O distribution revealing the variation in dynamical circulation between different meteorological years such that larger N 2 O values in the tropics suggest periods of stronger ascent. Stronger descent at the Poles was revealed by smaller N 2 O values. As expected, periods of strong Polar descent are, in general, accompanied by large Polar O 3 values, from the transport of O 3 -rich air from aloft. The zonal mean background distribution of NO y , a dynamical tracer, at an altitude of 32 km is studied as a function of the meteorological year. The change in NO y , from future supersonic aircraft, shows a pattern somewhat similar to that observed in the background N 2 O distribution with increases in NO y in the tropics particularly during 1994 meteorological conditions (Fig. 18, panel B) . This study therefore suggests that the stronger ascent observed in the tropics for the meteorology in 1994 produced an enhanced upward The RF values at a certain pressure level and latitude refer to a sustained emission of 1 Tg N yr \u00c01 at that location. transport of aircraft emissions from the lower stratosphere (Rogers et al., 2000) . The resulting increase in NO y (and hence NO x ) in the middle stratosphere leads to reduced O 3 concentrations in the region where NO x dominates the O 3 destruction.",

The study of Baughcum et al. (2003) evaluated the effect of fleet size, cruise altitude, NO x emission levels, water vapour emissions and sulphate emissions on O 3 . In their study, a two-dimensional model was used to evaluate parametrically the O 3 impact of supersonic aircraft as a function of fleet fuel use at cruise altitudes, EINO x , and cruise altitude. In Baughcum et al. (2003) the sensitivity of the O 3 impact calculated with the CSIRO model (Randeniya et al., 2002) was evaluated as a function of the choice of reaction rate constants. The version of the model using the JPL 1997 chemical kinetics assessment (DeMore et al., 1997) predicted larger O 3 perturbations than did calculations presented by IPCC (1999). These differences arose both from changes in the model transport and the use of the updated JPL reaction rate coefficients and photolysis cross-sections. This resulted in a greater sensitivity of O 3 depletion to NO x emission levels than in the previous assessment. Updating the reaction rate constants and photolysis cross sections in line with the JPL 2000 assessment of chemical kinetics (Sander et al., 2000) , resulted in an increase the calculated O 3 dependence on EINO x , because of the greater accumulation of exhaust emissions and the NO x being transported to higher altitudes where NO x chemistry dominates the O 3 removal process. The partial update to the JPL 2002 recommendations (Sander et al., 2003) resulted in a further increase in the impact, but not as large as that for the change from JPL 1997 to JPL 2000 chemistry (Fig. 19a) .",

The black line with the symbol ''\u00fe'' in Fig. 19 represents the SLIMCAT model calculation with updated reaction rates (Sander et al., 2000) . This result contrasts with the IPCC assessment, which suggested that the impact of supersonic aircraft on the atmosphere was primarily through the role of water vapour emissions both on atmospheric O 3 and climate change. This significant difference results from the inclusion of new kinetic data in SLIMCAT atmospheric chemical transport model. With the inclusion of the updated rates, an increase in the EINO x has a significant effect on the O 3 column, with a reduction in the Northern Hemisphere O 3 column of \u00c03.2% for an EINO x of 15. The reason for the large dependence of the column O 3 on the EINO x can be seen by considering that in the IPCC (1999) assessment, a crossover point in the O 3 chemical production and destruction terms from NO x chemistry, could be seen at an altitude of w20 km. With the new kinetic data, the cross-over point is at a much lower altitude in the SLIMCAT calculations. With the injection of supersonic aircraft emissions at w18 km almost all NO x and H 2 O emissions now take place in the region of O 3 chemical destruction. This has resulted in an O 3 decrease throughout the stratosphere and therefore in the O 3 column. This conclusion underlines the potential impact of a fleet of supersonic aircraft on the atmosphere and emphasises the necessity to continue to develop low NO x combustion engines for the future, as well as the importance of maintaining state of the art kinetic data and updating assessments of impacts.",

They concluded that aerosol emissions in a projected future (2050) 'mixed fleet' of subsonic and supersonic aircraft are likely to increase stratospheric O 3 above 20 km in altitude, because of a lowered loss from NO x . This midstratospheric O 3 increase was found to be larger than the O 3 decrease below 20 km, because of the reduced O 3 production from NO x and more O 3 depletion by increasing ClO and BrO. However, the net effect of aircraft aerosol emissions on the O 3 column can be highly model-dependent, being a function of the NO x removal efficiency from the aircraft emission region by large-scale transport (Rogers et al., 2002a) . The faster is the removal rate, the larger is the mid-stratospheric impact on O 3 .",

Microphysical simulations using domain-filling trajectories were performed in order to investigate the influence on Artic PSC formation and the properties of enhanced concentrations of HNO 3 and H 2 O, caused by aircraft emissions in year 2015 scenarios. The results showed that increased concentrations of HNO 3 and H 2 O, of the order of 5-10%, emitted from a combined fleet of subsonic and supersonic fleet, would have a direct influence on the thermodynamic threshold temperatures for the existence of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT), super-cooled ternary solutions (STS), and ice in the Northern Hemisphere Polar stratosphere (Fig. 20) . This may cause the frequency of occurrence of temperatures below these thresholds to increase by 2-5% and may enhance Type 1b PSC equilibrium volumes by about 10%. Increased concentrations of water vapour, caused by stratospheric aircraft emissions, imply higher freezing temperatures for ice in PSC particles, required for the formation of solid type of PSC particles. These results show that the 'supersonic' aircraft emission-induced formation of solid type PSC particles may significantly increase the denitrification rate and lead to even larger relative increases in dehydration.",

The model results indicated an enhanced heterogeneous ozone depletion during Antarctic spring arising from a longer period in which PSCs can form. In the northern hemisphere polar vortex, ozone depletion during arctic spring was unaffected by the water vapour increases, because of the lesser PSC activity. Pitari et al.

They found that atmospheric tracers are significantly affected by H 2 O and O 3 radiative feedbacks on the stratospheric circulation; one consequence is that dynamically driven O 3 changes have to be taken into account along with chemically produced ones. The spatial distribution of stratospheric H 2 O and O 3 (as well as other long-lived tracers) was determined by the stratospheric residual circulation, which could be perturbed by upsetting the latitudinal gradients of radiatively active gases. This is the case of lower stratospheric in situ H 2 O emissions from future supersonic aircraft: an increase of approximately 10% at Northern mid to high latitudes was predicted when treating H 2 O as a passive tracer (see also IPCC, 1999) . The consequently larger H 2 O latitudinal gradient increases the pole-toequator gradient of long-wave heating rates. Consequentially, the net effect may be that of a slight reinforcement of the stratospheric Brewer-Dobson circulation with enhanced tropical upwelling and mid-latitude subsidence. This change perturbs the O 3 distribution as well, producing more tracer accumulation in the extra tropical lowermost stratosphere. The globally averaged column O 3 change, was found to increase from \u00fe0.05% in the fixed circulation case to \u00fe0.6% in the radiatively interactive case. This net O 3 increase is a consequence of the enhanced mid-latitude downwelling branch of the Brewer-Dobson circulation, which transports more O 3 close to the tropopause, where the chemical loss is slower than at higher altitudes.",

They found a reduction in H 2 O accumulation at the tropical lower stratosphere, due to the above discussed stratospheric circulation reinforcement. This produced a significant reduction of the HSCT H 2 O climate forcing. A different conclusion was reached in the SCENIC project when the E39/C CCM was used: in this case the stratospheric accumulation of H 2 O from supersonic aircraft was found to increase when the radiative feedbacks were included, because of a tropical tropopause layer (TTL) warming produced by the supersonic aircraft emissions net RF (a warming not predicted by . These findings support the earlier conclusions of Rind and Lonergan (1995) that the magnitude of the direct climate forcing produced by an HSCT aircraft fleet is sufficiently large that it is important to consider the effect of the feedbacks when estimating the climatic/dynamic response to such aircraft emissions.",

The range of resultant forcings from the same emissions scenario can partly be explained by the variability in the differently simulated total water vapour increase: the CTM2, ULAQ and SLIM-CAT models show the same response with 0.37 AE 0.02 mW m \u00c02 Tg \u00c01 , whereas the E39/C model shows 0.28 mW m \u00c02 Tg \u00c01 : this smaller response is likely to have resulted from the larger H 2 O background in the E39/C model, leading to saturation effects (Forster et al., 2001) . The ULAQ radiation scheme showed a factor of 2 higher values than the E39/C model, employing the same H 2 O perturbation and background field (Table 8) . These results are consistent with previous findings (IPCC,1999) , which showed an uncertainty of a factor of two in the calculation of the water vapour related RF, with lower values derived with E39/C model, compared with a narrow band model (Forster and Shine, 1997) .",

For the aerosols, both the direct forcing (i.e. scattering and absorption of incoming solar radiation) and indirect forcing produced by changes of chemical species (i.e. O 3 ) affected by heterogeneous chemical processes on the surface of aerosol particles were calculated. The direct impact of aircraft SO 4 aerosols on RF was negative from scattering of solar radiation; the direct RF in the long-wave spectrum, on the other hand, was found to be negligible because of the small size of these particles. The RF from supersonic aircraft emissions of SO 4 aerosols ranged from about \u00c04 to \u00c023 mW m \u00c02 . Black carbon aerosols, on the other hand, normally give a positive RF since they effectively absorb incident solar radiation (the single scattering albedo is close to 0.7, whereas it is unity for SO 4 particles). As in the case of SO 4 , the small size of aircraft particles produced a negligible RF in the long-wave spectrum. The calculated RF from aircraft emissions of BC from supersonic aircraft ranged from about 0.4 to 11 mW m \u00c02 . Fig. 21 shows the (S6-S4) net global RF per component.

It is well known that aircraft emissions (either of the existing fleet or of potential future fleets) may affect ozone, cloudiness and aerosols (see sections 5 and 7, respectively). Although the underpinning mechanisms are well understood, quantification of these effects is still difficult because of the effects of other atmospheric processes (chemical or dynamical) which act in parallel. Similarly difficult is the prediction of these effects for future atmospheres. Once the changes in the aforementioned atmospheric factors (clouds, ozone and aerosols) are known, the calculation of changes in UV radiation levels at a given location and time is straightforward, through the use of radiative transfer models (RTMs). Such calculations have been made in the past (IPCC, 1999 -see Ryan et al., 1999) , showing that surface erythemal irradiance around the middle of the 21st century may increase by less than 1% at all latitude bands as a result of introducing supersonic aircraft in the future fleet. Without supersonic aircraft the erythemal irradiance was predicted to decrease, also by less than 1%. Finally, the IPCC (1999) report concluded that the uncertainties in the calculated irradiance are in the range \u00c02% to \u00fe3%. Whilst the focus of the IPCC (1999) report was to assess the impact of changes in the future fleet with respect to the present situation, this work presents estimates of the surface UV changes due to changes in the composition of the fleet under the predicted atmospheric conditions around the middle of the 21st century. The UV calculations were based on predictions from the ULAQ CCM which was run for the SCENIC project emission scenarios, specific for future supersonic aircraft emissions . The ULAQ CCM provided ozone columns and profiles, profiles of aerosol optical properties (optical thickness and single scattering albedo), and temperature profiles for 2050, representing the average of simulations for the period 2046-2055. These estimates were used as inputs to the Libradtran RTM (Mayer and Kylling, 2005) to calculate the daily erythemal irradiance changes between different scenarios under cloud-free conditions. The effect from possible changes in cloudiness has not been considered since, presently, the aviation-induced changes in cirrus clouds could not be distinguished from changes arising from natural variability, climate change or other anthropogenic effects (IPCC, 2007a,b) . The calculated monthly changes in erythemal UV irradiance at local noon for 6 scenarios relative to the base scenario, which includes only subsonic aircraft (SUB), are shown in Fig. 22 . The changes are averaged over the extra-tropical latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, where the bulk of the aircraft emissions occur. In all cases these changes are positive and smaller than 1%.",

The 'best' option would then be when both bars are minimal. With a constant RPK, the P4 (reduced speed) and the P6 (reduced cruise altitude) options offer the minimal impacts. The P5 scenario (range increase) also has a smaller impact for the combined effect (temperature and O 3 layer) than the base case. However, the increase in range leads to more air routes to South East Asia, which results in more emissions in the tropical tropopause layer and therefore a more intense transport of emitted NO x into the stratosphere, so that O 3 destruction is enhanced in the scenario P5, compared with the base case. The error bars indicate the minimum and maximum values that can be obtained including all uncertainties discussed in the previous sections, such as model-dependent chemical perturbation, RF calculations and climate sensitivity. Accounting for this uncertainty, the scenarios P4 and P6 both minimize the environmental impact. Both measures can be combined by calculating the product (green bars), which better visualizes the results.",

Contrails are line-shaped cirrus produced when the hot and moist air from the aircraft exhaust mixes with ambient air that is below a critical temperature determined by the Schmidt-Appleman criterion (Schmidt, 1941; Appleman, 1953; Schumann, 1996) . Contrail-cirrus is defined here as the cirrus formed from contrails after shear and/or uplift and mixing causes an increase in the areal extent of the contrail. The increase in areal coverage compared with that from contrails may be quantified by a 'spread factor'. 'Soot cirrus' is defined here as cirrus clouds induced by (or perhaps altered by) the addition of heterogeneous ice nuclei from aviation. Cirrus optical depth can decrease if heterogeneous nuclei are added to a region that is dominated by homogeneous ice nuclei (which require higher supersaturations to form ice). The formation of these cirrus clouds would typically have smaller ice number concentrations than those formed on homogeneous ice nuclei. Alternatively, if heterogeneous ice nuclei are added to a region where heterogeneous ice nuclei Fig. 22 . Monthly changes in surface erythemal irradiance (percentage) for different emission scenarios defined in SCENIC (see Table 4 ) relative to the base scenario. already dominate ice formation, cirrus ice number concentrations can increase, similar to the ''first indirect effect'' in ambient water clouds (Penner et al., 2001) .",

            "text": "Aircraft produce persistent contrails in the upper troposphere in ice-supersaturated air masses and these are routinely observed to shear and spread, producing additional cloudiness termed contrailcirrus, often forming 'fall streaks' (Heymsfield et al., 1998; Atlas et al., 2006) . Contrails are thin line-shaped cirrus clouds, which reflect solar radiation and trap outgoing terrestrial radiation. The latter effect is expected to dominate for thin cirrus (Stephens and Webster, 1981; Hartmann et al., 1992; Meerk\u00f6 tter et al., 1999) which results in a net positive RF value for contrails. Persistent contrail cover has been calculated on a global basis from meteorological reanalysis data or by using a modified cirrus cloud parameterization in a GCM (Ponater et al., 2002; Marquart et al., 2003) . Calculations of contrail cover depend upon the extent of supersaturated regions in the atmosphere. This extent is poorly known, but the probability of ice supersaturated regions has been characterized in regions where aircraft typically fly using data from MOZAIC by Gierens et al. (1999a,b) and a global climatology of ice-supersaturated regions has been developed using data from both MLS 5 and AIRS 6 (Spichtinger et al., 2003; Gettleman et al., 2006) . Differences between these climatologies and the MOZAIC data are thought to be due to the characteristic sampling volumes for the satellite data as well as the inability of MLS to distinguish adequately between water vapour and thin cirrus. The recent extension of ice supersaturation in the ECMWF integrated forecast system allows the possibility of future assessments based on analysed data or forecast systems (Tompkins et al., 2007) .",

The large number of small ice crystals that are present in contrails may be heated by long-wave radiation from the ground, causing an instability that leads to uplift and causes further supersaturation with the consequent formation of additional cloudiness . Alternatively, the regions of depleted supersaturation in the contrail core may mix with supersaturated regions outside the contrail, allowing further growth of the contrail particles and their eventual precipitation out of the region, followed by further mixing of supersaturated areas and areas of the contrail core (Heymsfield et al., 1998) . The ratio of the areal coverage of such cloudiness to that from line-shaped contrails, termed the 'spread factor', was estimated to be 1.8 by Minnis et al. (2004) . The estimate of Mannstein and Schumann (2005) should no longer be cited since a similar increase in cirrus coverage with air traffic density has been estimated using the ECHAM4 climate model with natural cirrus only (Mannstein and Schumann, 2007) . Estimates of the radiative effects of this additional cloudiness have also been attempted based upon trends in cirrus cloudiness (see Section 7.3 - Boucher, 1999; Fahey et al., 1999; Zerefos et al., 2003; Minnis et al., 2004; Stordal et al., 2005; Stubenrauch and Schumann, 2005; Eleftheratos et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "Estimates of contrail RF are available from a number of studies Marquart and Mayer, 2002; Marquart et al., Fig. 23 . Changes in global mean surface temperature for the year 2100 (solid bars) and for O 3 (dashed bars) for constant revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) of the total fleet (blue) and constant HSCT RPK (red). The product of both factors is added (green) for constant HSCT RPK. For each bar an uncertainty range is given, which represents minimum and maximum values. No bars are added when only one model has calculated chemical perturbations. In those cases the same uncertainty range has been assumed as for P4 for the calculation of the uncertainty of the product . 5 Microwave Limb Sounder, an instrument aboard the NASA Aura satellite. 6 Atmospheric Infrared Sounder. 7 The expression 'contrail cirrus' appears to have been first used by Nicodemus and McQuigg (1969) , and has subsequently fallen into more popular usage, e.g. Schumann: 'Contrail Cirrus. Invited paper, Cirrus-Topical Meeting, Optical Society of America, Baltimore, October 6-8, 1998', and Schumann (2002). 2003; R\u00e4 del and Stuber and Forster, 2007 ) that use coverage calculated either externally (e.g. Sausen et al., 1998) or internally within a GCM. Whilst the earliest studies assumed a specified optical depth of the contrails (e.g. Minnis et al., 1999) , the most recent parameterizations within GCMs have allowed contrail optical depth to be predicted (Ponater et al., 2002) , although some recent studies still prescribe an optical depth (e.g. Stuber and Forster, 2007; R\u00e4 del and Shine, 2008) . Marquart et al. (2003) used this predicted optical depth within the ECHAM GCM to determine a radiative forcing in 1992, 2015, and 2050 of 3.5 mW m \u00c02 , 9.4 mW m \u00c02 , and 14.8 mW m \u00c02 , respectively. These estimates did not include diurnal variations in traffic density but an estimate of this effect resulted in a 10% decrease in the net forcing for 1992. Other studies, however, have shown that the daily cycle of air traffic can be quite important (Meerk\u00f6 tter et al., 1999; Myhre and Stordal, 2001; Stuber et al., 2006; Stuber and Forster, 2007) . For example, Stuber and Forster (2007) found that 60% of the global annual mean forcing is associated with night flights, even though only 40% of the distance travelled by aircraft is during the night. Myhre and Stordal (2001) used the Sausen et al. (1998) contrail coverage distribution and the diurnal variation from Schmitt and Brunner (1997) to estimate a reduced forcing of 9 mWm \u00c02 compared with their estimate of 11 mW m \u00c02 when diurnal variations were not included. Stuber and Forster (2007) used the ECMWF forecast fields to predict contrail cover (outside of the Bakan et al. (1994) region to which all studies tuned their predicted cover) and found an estimated forcing for 1992 of 2.0 mWm \u00c02 (and 2.4 mWm \u00c02 without the diurnal cycle) (Stuber and Forster, 2007) . Both Myhre and Stordal (2001) and Stuber and Forster (2007) assume the contrail optical depth (0.3 and 0.1, respectively) whereas the optical depth in Marquart et al. (2003) is predicted. Contrail optical thickness has been found to be greater over the United States than over Western Europe (Palikonda et al., 2005; Meyer et al., 2002; Ponater et al., 2002) , a feature that is captured in the Marquart et al. (2003) simulations.",

            "text": "The average effect of contrails on the earth's radiation budget, on RF and climate, depends in particular on their global coverage and mean optical thickness. Both quantities are not well known, although model-derived values of contrail cover seem to be similar. This, however, is a consequence of the adjustment of the modelled contrail cover to an observed value in the region 35-75 N and \u00c030 W to 30 E (Bakan et al., 1994) . Unfortunately, this observation (based on visual inspection of satellite scenes) is itself rather uncertain. Most striking is the decrease in contrail coverage between the periods 1979-1981 and 1989-1992 over Western Europe in that study, despite the increase in air traffic. The observed annual cycle has a maximum in spring/summer which is contrary to expectations based on the annual cycle of upper tropospheric relative humidity and is contrary to results from automatic contrail detection (Mannstein et al., 1999) . Bakan et al. also reported a considerable interannual variability with root mean square values of contrail cover of the same magnitude as the average values themselves. The reported averages are often taken to refer to a base year of 1992, but actually, they are some mixture of base years one decade apart, over which period air traffic increased substantially. Later studies (e.g. R\u00e4 del and Shine, 2008) considered more recent years and accounted for the air traffic increase when using the Bakan et al. value for adjustment. However, even if the annual growth factor were known, it is not clear from which year onwards one should apply the growth factor. Last, but not least, visual inspection is a highly subjective method. Mannstein et al. (1999) found that contrail cover derived by various trained observers differed by a factor of 2. Meyer et al. (2007) studied contrail cover over Europe and South East Asia (Thailand and Japan) from AVHRR 8 images and compared the results with contrail cover from the GCM ECHAM4 (Ponater et al., 2002) , which was adjusted to the Bakan et al. value. While the GCM has twice as much contrail coverage over Europe than the contrail detection algorithm gives, the situation is the opposite over South East Asia where the contrail detection algorithm sees more than 50% greater contrail coverage than the GCM. Although part of this discrepancy is due to the different base years of the satellite observations and the GCM simulation, this shows that the normalization factor is not constant over the globe or that the GCM algorithm does not capture the correct regional variation. Gierens et al. (1999a,b) showed that the adjustment factor depends on whether fuel consumption or flown distance is used as a measure of air traffic. When flown distances are used instead of fuel use, the computed contrail coverage showed large regional differences from \u00fe15% over USA to \u00c050% over SE Asia compared with the fuel-based parameterization.",

The latter has values from 10 to 100 mm in the literature for contrails older than 30 min. From this assumption, Meyer et al. (2002) derived a range of 0.1-0.2 for the average optical thickness of contrails over Europe; contrails over USA are on the average optically thicker.

Cirrus clouds come in a variety of forms, ranging from optically thick anvil cirrus, closely associated with deep convection, to optically thin cirrus layers frequently observed near the tropopause. Thick anvil cirrus is created by the detrainment of condensate from cumulus updrafts. After the convection diminishes, the remaining detached anvil can evolve to form optically thin cirrus layers as the ice crystals with large radii precipitate out of the anvil (Prabhakara et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1996) . The formation of thin cirrus layers can also occur resulting from the synoptic scale uplift of a humid layer (Jensen et al., 1996 (Jensen et al., , 2005 Heymsfield and McFarquhar, 1996; Winker and Trepte, 1998) .",

However, the impact of aircraft particles on ambient cirrus depends upon the type of ice nuclei present in the ambient atmosphere without aircraft emissions. The particles that initiate ice formation include externally mixed sulphate aerosols, which may homogeneously freeze if temperatures are less than 235 K and supersaturations are greater than 45% with respect to ice (Koop et al., 1998) . Heterogeneous nucleation involves aerosol particles that serve as some kind of substrate that matches the crystalline structure of ice. Heterogeneous mechanisms include direct deposition from vapour to ice on a suitable nucleus (deposition nucleation) and freezing of previously condensed supercooled cloud or haze droplets, with the freezing initiated either by contact of a nuclei with the cloud or haze droplet (contact nucleation) or by a nuclei immersed within the cloud or haze droplet (immersion nucleation). Condensation nucleation, where water freezes as it condenses on a particle is also possible. There is still a lack of data on the concentrations and properties of heterogeneous ice nuclei (IN) in the upper troposphere. Measurements during the NASA CRYSTAL-FACE mission confirmed that mineral dust and metallic particles are common heterogeneous IN (Sassen et al., 2003; DeMott et al., 2003a; Cziczo et al., 2004) . Analyses of ice nucleating aerosols collected in the upper troposphere during the Subsonic Aircraft: Contrail and Cloud Effects Special Study (SUCCESS) showed that carbonaceous and crustal particles dominated the number fraction of IN (Chen et al., 1998) .",

Heymsfield and Miloshevich (1993) and Jensen and Toon (1994) concluded that homogeneous nucleation of supercooled drops is responsible for the occurrence of ice. However, DeMott et al. (1994) argued that even a small number of heterogeneous IN can initiate ice formation earlier at lower RHI, suppressing homogeneous nucleation, and changing cirrus cloud properties. DeMott et al. (1997) showed that if insoluble particles were at least 10% of the total number concentration and updrafts were less than 20 cm s \u00c01 , they would determine the ice number concentration. On the other hand, Hoyle et al. (2005) demonstrated that the high ice crystal number concentrations (0.1-50 cm \u00c03 ) measured in cirrus clouds during the SUCCESS mission could only be explained by taking small-scale temperature fluctuations into account (which produce larger cooling rates equivalent to larger updrafts) and assuming that the freezing of ice occurs homogeneously. The formation of a tropopause cirrus cloud layer observed during CRYSTAL-FACE was reproduced using a model with ice nucleation via homogeneous freezing of sulphate aerosols that included the observed temperature perturbations (Jensen et al., 2005) . It seems likely, based on the analysis of the Interhemispheric Differences in Cirrus Properties From Anthropogenic Emissions (INCA) project measurements of RHI, which show less frequent observation of RHI above about 130% outside of clouds in the Northern Hemisphere compared with the Southern Hemisphere, that a heterogeneous freezing mode occurs at least in some Northern mid-latitude cirrus clouds (Haag et al., 2003, see Fig. 24 ). Heterogeneous IN have a non-linear impact on the cirrus occurrence, optical extinction, and the fraction of clouds that are subvisible, due to the competition between the homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation mechanisms (Haag and K\u00e4 rcher, 2004) .",

In regions where homogenous freezing of solution droplets is the dominant formation pathway for cold cirrus without aircraft emissions, the addition of heterogeneous IN would be expected to decrease ice number concentrations or, possibly, to increase cirrus cloud coverage. But, if the ambient atmosphere is dominated by heterogeneous IN from sources other than aircraft, the addition of more heterogeneous IN would be expected to increase ice number concentrations . The former effect could lead to either a positive, or a negative RF. A negative RF would result if the areal coverage of cloud ice water path were undisturbed, but ice number concentrations were decreased, while a positive RF may result if ice coverage increases. An increase in ice number concentrations, with no change in areal coverage of ice water path, would be expected in regions dominated by heterogeneous ice nucleation and would lead to a positive RF.",

Nucleation-mode aerosol concentrations are important, since these particles may determine the total aerosol number concentration and are able to grow to sizes that would act as homogeneous nuclei for cirrus formation through coagulation and condensation. Over the Pacific Ocean, Clarke and Kapustin (2002) found evidence of nucleation-mode (Dp > 3 nm) particles (z10,000 cm \u00c03 AE 25,000 at STP) when refractory particle concentrations were small relative to volatile concentrations. Some models that include binary nucleation of sulphate aerosols from gas phase H 2 SO 4 capture the trends in these data, but with somewhat higher concentrations at some locations (Spracklen et al., 2005) , while others predict smaller concentrations by about a factor of 10 (Lauer et al., 2005) . By contrast, the nucleation-mode (Dp > 5 nm) measurements by Minikin et al. (2003) near Punta Arenas in the Southern Hemisphere and near Scotland in the Northern Hemisphere and in the Southern Hemisphere LACE campaign were significantly smaller (median: 350 cm \u00c03 with a 25 and 75 percentile range from 180 to 830 cm \u00c03 and median: 1400 cm \u00c03 with a 25 and 75 percentile range from 450 to 15,000 cm \u00c03 , in the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere INCA campaign, respectively, and median 800 cm \u00c03 with a 25 and 75 percentile range from 400 to 1100 cm \u00c03 at STP in the Northern Hemisphere European LACE campaign).

Thus, it is only a small fraction of the ambient soot aerosol that acts as ice nuclei. Kristensson et al. (2000) report a decrease in effective diameter of 10-30% in cirrus clouds perturbed by aircraft, a finding which is not observed at temperatures warmer than \u00c030 C. This finding may imply that aircraft BC act as effective heterogeneous IN (i.e. at lower relative humidities than those required for ice formation on sulphate) in ambient cirrus that also form on IN or that the cirrus found in these corridors are aged contrail cirrus, where conditions are known to be such that aircraft soot does act as an IN.",

This is consistent with the report by Seifert et al. (2003) that scavenging ratios (fraction of ambient particles included in crystals) were <1% in the INCA campaign. Seifert et al. also showed that the ice crystal number density is dominated by residual particles with diameters of less than 0.1 mm, and, in this size range, high interstitial number concentrations are not necessarily associated with high ice crystal number concentrations.

Unfortunately, the numbers of particles with sizes below 100 mm could not be reliably counted in these early experiments. Table 10 provides a summary of ice crystal concentrations and sizes for experiments since 1990. The microphysical properties of cirrus clouds have been studied by using satellite (Ou et al., 1998) , groundbased remote sensing (Intrieri et al., 1993; Mace et al., 1998) , and in situ measurements (Str\u00f6 m and Heintzenberg, 1994) . However, only a few measurements have attempted to quantify total ice crystal number in cirrus clouds, and the number of small particles is still controversial, since particle shattering within the inlet of airborne probes may cause over-counting (Korolev and Isaac, 2005; McFarquhar et al., 2007) . Available measurements of ice crystal number concentrations (N i ) have been made with a variety of instruments that do not always agree (Heymsfield and McFarquhar, 2002) and the temporal and spatial scatter of observed values is large. Measurements of ice crystal number concentration in cirrus clouds published since 1990 are summarized in Table 10 . Notably, Gayet et al. (2004) found that the number concentration and size distribution of crystals in the Northern Hemisphere differs from that in the Southern Hemisphere.

            "text": "We note that if ice nuclei concentrations are high enough (>10-50 cm \u00c03 ) most of the observed ice crystal concentrations must be produced as a result of homogeneous nucleation on volatile particles (e.g. DeMott et al., 1997) . Even if only a small fraction of soot aerosols act as heterogeneous IN, nucleation on these IN may determine ice concentrations in many of the clouds with lower number concentrations. Model-predicted ice crystal number concentrations are within the ranges reported above (e.g. Lohmann et al., 2004; Hendricks et al., 2005) , but the observed variability precludes distinguishing a dominant role for homogeneous nucleation versus heterogeneous nucleation. Penner et al. (2009) have implemented an off-line calculation of two recently developed physically-based ice nucleation parameterizations K\u00e4 rcher et al., 2006) to calculate the ice crystal number concentration. Both parameterization methods are able to represent the competition between homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation pathways, and to link the N i to aerosol properties, thus allowing a nucleation simulation that accounts for the effects of different aerosol types (sulphate, soot, and mineral dust). This calculation requires assumptions regarding the small-scale velocity perturbations responsible for forming regions with supersaturation, but a probability distribution for these updrafts, with a mean of 0 cm s \u00c01 and a standard deviation of 0.33 cm s \u00c01 seems a reasonable choice (Haag and K\u00e4 rcher, 2004; K\u00e4 rcher and Str\u00f6 m, 2003) . This off-line calculation did not include any feedbacks to the climate system, so does not provide any measure of the change in cloud coverage due to soot aerosols. Results show that changes in aerosol species can lead to large changes in ice number concentration (wAE5 cm \u00c03 ) and in effective radius. Results using two versions of the aerosol model were also estimated. In the first version, the sulphate number concentration from binary homogeneous nucleation and growth from the nucleation mode to the Aitken and accumulation modes was predicted. In the second version, only aerosol mass was predicted. In the latter model, aerosol number concentrations were diagnosed from the predicted sulphate and soot aerosol mass concentrations using an assumed size distribution whilst in the former, only soot size distributions were assumed. Since pure sulphate aerosol is highly soluble, it was assumed that it forms ice through homogeneous freezing after deliquescence. Soot particles are assumed to be efficient heterogeneous IN, with a freezing threshold RHI of w130% in and w140% in K\u00e4 rcher et al. (2006) . Fig. 25 shows the annual mean values of in-cloud ice number density N i at 140 hPa and 190 hPa. The two parameterization methods produced quite similar N i patterns indicating good agreement between the two parameterization methods, but the K\u00e4 rcher parameterization (KL) has higher ice number concentrations in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere since ice nucleation is dominated by homogeneous nucleation in this region. The Liu and Penner (LP) parameterization has lower ice concentrations at these levels since lower RHI must be achieved for heterogeneous nucleation to activate in the LP parameterization. In both parameterizations, homogeneous ice nucleation produces higher N i and is a dominant mechanism for ice nucleation at high altitudes because of the very low temperature and high RHI there. At lower altitudes, heterogeneous ice nucleation becomes important and produces generally lower N i . The higher N i towards lower altitudes from the KL parameterization than those from the LP parameterization is caused by the higher freezing RHI threshold value for heterogeneous IN used in the KL parameterization.",

Aerosol concentrations were calculated from the coupled aerosol and climate models with present-day and pre- industrial emissions. An analytical formulation relating the ice effective radius (r e ) to ice volume mean radius (r v ) was derived using combined ice crystal size distributions (a gamma distribution for length less than 20 mm and a power-law distribution for larger particles) (Wyser, 1998) . The ice crystal shape was assumed to be hexagonal columns. The global statistics of N i and r e occurrence probability with different emission scenarios were examined. There are two modes in the probability distributions for N i and r e , one at larger ice number concentrations, which is associated with homogeneous nucleation, and one at smaller ice number concentrations, which is associated with heterogeneous nucleation. These are shifted by adding anthropogenic soot: for the mode where homogeneous nucleation dominates (with higher N i and lower r e ), an increase in the heterogeneous IN (soot) inhibits the ice formation through homogeneous nucleation, lowers N i and increases r e . However, for the mode where the heterogeneous nucleation dominates (with lower N i and higher r e ), an increase in soot particles increases N i and lowers r e . Thus, the combined effects narrow both the N i and r e probability distributions. The addition of anthropogenic sulphate (through homogeneous ice nucleation) has little effect on N i and r e except in the Southern Hemisphere.",

            "text": "Changes to the ice crystal effective radius can have important implications for both the short-wave (SW) and long-wave (LW) radiation in cirrus clouds. Penner et al. (2009) estimated the RF at the top of atmosphere (TOA) arising from anthropogenic aerosols (see Fig. 26 ). The net RF (SW plus LW) of anthropogenic aerosols through effects on cirrus cloud ice number and effective radius can be both positive (i.e., LW forcing dominates over SW forcing), or negative (i.e., SW forcing dominates over LW forcing). SW and LW forcing in the tropics is particularly sensitive to aerosol changes because of the low temperatures in the upper troposphere and high cirrus cloud fractions there. In many regions of the tropics and in the South Pole where homogeneous ice nucleation dominates, the net forcing from anthropogenic soot is negative because of a reduction of ice number by adding soot. In other regions where heterogeneous ice nucleation dominates, a net positive forcing is expected because of an increase of ice number, and a reduction of r e . The global mean net TOA forcing ranges from \u00c00.01 to \u00fe0.04 W m \u00c02 from total anthropogenic sulphate for the KL and LP parameterizations, respectively and from \u00c00.4 to \u00c00.3 Wm \u00c02 for soot from surface sources, and from \u00c00.16 to \u00c00.12 Wm \u00c02 for aircraft soot . Calculated values based on the KL parameterization are shown in Fig. 26 . These values were estimated using the version of the IMPACT model that predicts sulphate aerosol mass and number, but uses assumed size distributions for the other aerosol particles. When the version of the model that does not predict sulphate aerosol number concentration resulting from binary nucleation of H 2 SO 4 vapour is used or when the relative humidity at which soot particles activate to form heterogeneous IN changes, the forcing may change. For example, the forcing associated with aircraft soot becomes positive (but near zero) when the mass only version of the model with the LP parameterization is used. Clearly, there is a need to refine these values and to understand the effects of changing aerosol concentrations on ice number concentration and size.",

Nevertheless, IPCC (1999 -see Fahey et al., 1999) used the difference in trend in cirrus coverage from surface-based observations (which are smaller than those from the then-current ISCCP data) inferred by Minnis et al. (2001) [proceedings referenced in Zerefos et al. (2003) ] in regions predicted to have contrail coverage >0.5% (as inferred by Sausen et al., 1998) compared with the trend in regions predicted to have contrail coverage <0.5%, to place constraints on the forcing by the so-called 'aircraft-induced' cloudiness. The trend difference over land (where 84% of contrail coverage was expected) was 1.6%/decade for the period from 1971 to 1991, which implies an increase of 4.8% if extended over 30 years. This amounts to an increase of about 0.2% in total cirrus cloud cover. Assuming optical properties similar to those for contrails (i.e. optical depth 0.3, as assumed in IPCC (1999)), then the RF was estimated to be 40 mW m \u00c02 .",

            "text": "The first analysis of cirrus formation induced by aviation made since the IPCC (1999) estimate was that of Zerefos et al. (2003) . They used the ISCCP D2 data set over 1984-1998 to estimate changes in cirrus cloud cover. They first used regression analysis to remove the influence of ENSO, the QBO, the NAO, and any linear trend associated with tropopause temperature. This resulted in somewhat larger trend differences for ISCCP data for the same period as that based on Minnis et al. (2001) (as first reported in Fahey et al., 1999) in regions with high and low contrail coverage over land, but smaller differences over ocean regions (which were not statistically significant). These trend differences over land are decreased to 2.2%/decade when considering the extended time-period 1984 to 1998. However, this trend is still larger than that reported by Fahey et al. (1999) for surface-based observations, which may indicate an increase in the forcing due to these changes in cloud coverage of up to 55 mW m \u00c02 (i.e. 0.2/ 4.8 \u00bc X/6.6 to give the change in cirrus, and 0.04 mW m \u00c02 \u00c2 X/0.2 to give the increase in forcing) associated with increasing cirrus cloudiness associated with air traffic. Minnis et al. (2004) also used the ISCCP D2 data, but relied on a longer time period to determine the trends in cloud cover. Data from the surface network cirrus trend relative to the air traffic increase was used to derive a spreading factor for trends in cloud cover relative to the trends inferred for linear contrails from the model study of linear contrail cover of Sausen et al. (1998) . They excluded areas with significant changes in relative humidity at 300 hPa, which was expected to correlate with changes in natural cirrus cloud cover. This only left the United States as a possible study area. Applying the spreading factor to the estimated linear contrail cover from Sausen et al. (1998) , and reducing the optical depth to between 0.15 and 0.25 from that assumed in IPCC, and considering an increase in the pressure at which contrails are considered from 200 to 225 hPa lead to a range in forcing of from 15.3 to 25.5 mW m \u00c02 . They also applied the spreading factor of 1.8 to the forcing estimate for linear contrails from Marquart and Mayer (2002) of 3.2 mW m \u00c02 to obtain a lower bound for the total cirrus cloudiness forcing from aircraft of 6 mW m \u00c02 . Stubenrauch and Schumann (2005) used data from TOVS Path-B satellite which provides an estimate of both temperature at 25 hPa intervals and precipitable water column between 300 and 100 hPa. These data allowed them to estimate relative humidity between 9 and 15 km as well as a criterion for the relative humidity in this layer associated with clear sky, general cirrus formation, and potential contrail formation. The difference in the trends in effective cloud amount (emissivity \u00c2 coverage in percentage) in regions with potential contrails, and all situations or between regions with potential contrails and cirrus regions therefore allowed them to determine those trends specifically associated with air traffic. Weighted by the frequency of potential contrail occurrence (which is 7% and 5% for Europe and the North Atlantic flight corridor, respectively), they deduced an increase in cloud cover associated with air traffic of 0.2-0.25% decade \u00c01 over Europe and an increase of 0.08-0.24% decade \u00c01 over the North Atlantic flight corridor during the period 1987-1995. The authors considered these to be minimum values since TOVS is not sensitive to clouds with optical depth <0.1 in the visible. Stordal et al. (2005) revisited the trends in cirrus associated with the ISCCP D2 data set from 1984 to 2000. They noted difficulties in determining trends using ISCCP because the different viewing angles can introduce discontinuities in the detection of high cloud and cloud trends. Moreover, the ISCCP algorithm is only sensitive to high clouds with optical depth >0.3. They attempted to minimize such problems by examining trends only in the regions seen by the METEOSAT satellites. The estimated trend in high cloud cover associated with air traffic density (distance flown per km 2 h \u00c01 ) in 2000 was estimated as 0.23% with a lower limit of 0.07% and an upper limit of 0.41%, giving a trend in cirrus of 1-2% decade \u00c01 . Mannstein and Schumann (2005) also correlated the trend in cirrus cloud cover with air traffic density, but using 2 months of cirrus data from METEOSAT and actual air traffic data from EURO-CONTROL. For relating cirrus cover C and traffic density D they used an approach that takes overlapping of contrails and saturation effects (e.g. finite size of ice-supersaturated regions) into account: C tot (D) \u00bc C 0 \u00fe C pot [1 \u00c0 exp(\u00c0D/D * )], where C 0 is cover of natural cirrus, C pot is the potential coverage of contrails and contrail cirrus , and the term in square brackets is the fraction of C pot that is actually covered by contrails. D* denotes the mean air traffic density that would lead in an ice-supersaturated region to a total coverage by cirrus clouds without any overlap. It was shown that the relation between additional cirrus coverage and air traffic density indeed followed roughly the exponential model. The main result of this study was that over Europe aviation was determined to be responsible for additional cirrus coverage of 3% (consistent with the result of Stordal et al.) . This implies that the mean coverage of contrail cirrus over Europe exceeds the corresponding mean coverage of linear contrails by one order of magnitude. However, Mannstein and Schumann (2007) point out that the correlation found in Mannstein and Schumann (2005) was also found in some model simulations of natural cirrus, implying that the increase in cirrus with air traffic density is affected by spurious correlations of air traffic and natural cirrus coverage. Krebs (2006) extended the study of Mannstein and Schumann, by analysing cirrus coverage and air traffic of 11 months in 2004, for Europe, North Africa, and the North Atlantic. Over this extended region he also found a significant correlation between cirrus coverage and air traffic density. The air traffic induced cirrus cover was smaller than that found in the Mannstein and Schumann (2005) study, namely 0.6 AE 0.2% as regions with essentially no air traffic, of course, leading to smaller mean additional cirrus coverage have been included. Krebs also investigated the effect of the additional cirrus on the radiation budget of the earth based on satellite data. He found a warming of 1.1 W m \u00c02 for the region of interest, a value that is more than eight times larger than the value estimated by Boucher (1999) . As noted above, it is currently not clear how much of the correlation in this work between air traffic and cirrus cloudiness is actually due to a causal relationship. Hence the determination of the RF from contrail cirrus is fraught with very large uncertainties; studies to resolve the differences and to constrain the error margins are certainly needed.",

It is of course difficult to prove a causal relationship from correlation statistics because of a number of factors, e.g natural variability, other climate change effects and cyclical influences (e.g. NAO). These other influences may be of the same magnitude or larger than the possible aviation effect. Some of the aforementioned studies have attempted to reduce the uncertainties arising from other factors by screening the data for them (e.g. Zerefos et al., 2003 Zerefos et al., , 2007 . Nonetheless, any correlation-type study will encounter such difficulties and it may be the case that little more can be learned from observational studies in the absence of process-type modelling that can be used to support the analysis. For example, a potentially serious limitation to the above studies that utilize data from the ISSCP project are artificial trends in the data set, e.g. due to changes in the satellite viewing geometry, as discussed by Evan et al. (2007) .",

The underlying Chapter 6 of the 1999 assessment presented a new measure, the radiative forcing index (RFI) for aviation, which was derived from the ratio of total instantaneous RF to that from CO 2 alone. Unfortunately, some commentators have misunderstood this as an emission metric, i.e. that total RF can be related directly to an annual rate of emissions of CO 2 -this is erroneous. The use of RFI for other sub-sectors would lead to nonsensical results. For example, dirty coal-fired power plants or maritime shipping is likely to have a zero or negative RFI in their first decade of growth because the direct and indirect cooling from the sulphate aerosols will offset the effect of CO 2 emissions, although the CO 2 will eventually emerge as the dominant RF. For this and other scientific reasons (Wit et al., 2005; Forster et al., 2006 Forster et al., , 2007a Fuglestvedt et al., 2009 ) this report rejects RFI as a suitable emissions index.",

Firstly, the RF used in the ratio is the instantaneous RF and the history of aviation's forcing of climate evolves with CO 2 , as it accumulates in the atmosphere, becoming relatively more important over time. The relationship between RF and global mean surface temperature change only applies in steady-state, when the RF is constant, and thus aviation's 1992 instantaneous RF is neither a measure of the climate change attributable to aviation up to 1992 nor that in the future. Secondly, the IPCC (1999) assessment of the aviation sector included non-Kyoto greenhouse gases. An equivalently thorough assessment of other sectors has not been performed until recently.",

RF is useful as a first-order metric to quantify climate impacts because of its relationship to global mean surface temperature change through the linear equation (1). Nevertheless, this relationship is often misinterpreted since the studies that relate RF to global mean surface temperature are steady state: i.e., the RF is held fixed for more than a century as the climate system responds. Unfortunately, the RF from aviation is an increasing, evolving mix of components: CO 2 emissions accumulate in the atmosphere and its RF builds up while the RF from O 3 , CH 4 , aerosols, and contrails are in a quasi steady-state, reflecting only more recent emissions. The timescale for most of these atmospheric perturbations is less than a year, except for the 12-year response time of CH 4 (Stevenson et al., 2006 ; see also Table 5 , IPCC, 2001 chapter for CH 4 feedback is needed here). For CO 2 , the range of time scales reflect the equilibration times with the different carbon reservoirs and the history of its emissions needs to be taken into account. For example, 1940 can be considered the beginning of significant aviation activities (Sausen and Schumann, 2000) , whereas significant shipping emissions began in the late 19th Century (Eyring et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2007) . The climate response to changes in RF has its own time scales. Even short-lived RF perturbations, such as that caused by Mt. Pinatubo, have decadal or longer impacts on climate. Thus, the complete history of RF, which includes shifts in the relative apportionment of different causes (e.g., O 3 vs. CO 2 ), is needed to attribute climate change both at present and in the near future.",

Thus, whilst a short-term forcing response may be removed quickly by cessation of the activity or emission, e.g. contrails, the climate response in terms of DT will only decay on much longer timescales if the atmosphere has been subjected to that forcing for some time. When the climate response timescale is coupled to the long lifetime of CO 2 , this means that if the emission source were removed the temperature response from past emissions would actually increase after the cessation of emissions before damping very slowly. This phenomenon was illustrated for aviation CO 2 and O 3 effects by Sausen and Schumann (2000) , and the concept of residual future warming from past emissions is often referred to as unrealized or committed warming (e.g. Hansen et al., 1985; Friedlingstein and Solomon, 2005; Meehl et al., 2005) 9 . This is illustrated in two ways in Fig. 27 using a simple model that treats all the aviation forcing components Lee et al., 2009) . Panel A of Fig. 27 shows the RF responses of CO 2 , non-CO 2 effects and total RF to the historical development of aviation emissions to year 2000, after which, emissions are 'switched off' in the model simulation. The non-CO 2 RF goes negative after the cessation of emissions because of the lifetime of CH 4 , whilst the CO 2 RF decays only slowly, in line with carbon sink timescales. The equivalent temperature responses of CO 2 and non-CO 2 forcing agents from aviation are shown in Fig. 27 panel B: here, because of the inertia of the climate system, the temperature response of the non-CO 2 forcings decay slowly, and the CO 2 temperature response decays even more slowly because of the timescales of response of carbon sinks, coupled with the response time of the climate system. Fig. 27 panel C shows an idealized pulse response case of RF, where a global aviation emissions are released for a year in proportion to those from the current-day fleet and the temperature decay response is followed (Fig. 27, panel D) , showing the longer decay time for CO 2 vs. non-CO 2 forcings and the negative temperature response for the non-CO 2 forcings being driven by CH 4 , switching to a positive long-term temperature response (many centuries) from the CO 2 forcing. The decay time for a metric like DT is extended because of the thermal inertia of the climate system, and even the total non-CO 2 short-lived RF shows the decadal-timescale decay time of the climate system.",

Aviation-specific efficacies have only been extensively studied with the ECHAM climate model (Ponater et al., 2006) , see Table 11 . However, since r i is a ratio, it should be relatively constant across different climate models. However, in the recent summary of results from the 2007 IPCC WG1 assessment (Forster et al., 2007a) this is not obvious and consistent values of r i for aviation forcings are still undemonstrated. Simple climate models (SCMs) are often used to analyse changes in mean global surface temperatures, which has been undertaken for aviation (e.g. Sausen and Schumann, 2000) and the transport sector as a whole and its components (Fuglestvedt et al., 2008) . It is possible to incorporate aviation-specific efficacies into such modelling. However, whilst the usage of SCMs is instructive and can provide analyses not possible with GCMs, they have the serious disadvantage that they operate on global mean forcings and temperature responses. For aviation, as is the case for other sectors, some of these forcings may be positive and some negative (e.g. shipping, see Eyring et al., 2009) . This can give the spurious impression of a net zero RF having no temperature impact. The most obvious example for aviation is the positive O 3 RF and negative CH 4 RF arising from NO x emissions. For this example, IPCC (1999) showed that these forcings, although arising from the same emission, operated across different spatial scales and made the point that ''.the latitudinal distribution of the radiative imbalance from these two perturbations does not cancel.'' and that ''The response of the climate system to such geographically non-homogeneous forcing is unknown.'' (IPCC, 1999 -Prather et al., 1999 . Some work has subsequently been undertaken over issues of non-homogeneous forcings in general. Forster et al. (2000) applied a range of idealized forcings with an intermediate GCM (IGCM) and found that forcing of the Northern Hemisphere (>30 N) gave a 40% greater climate sensitivity than at latitudes <30 N. In a study of climate sensitivity, Boer and Yu (2003a) found that the spatial structure of the temperature response to long-lived GHG (LLGHG) and sulphate forcings did not resemble the structure of the forcings, but the temperature response structure is rather driven by localized feedbacks. Boer and Yu (2003a) also note that forcings that occur in regions of positive feedbacks will produce comparatively large responses both locally and globally. However, elsewhere, Boer and Yu (2003b) also note that the global mean temperature response is proportional to global mean RF, broadly independent of the nature and pattern of the forcings in their simulations of LLGHG and 9 However, it should be noted that the usage of the term 'unrealized or committed warming' is very different to the concept of 'committed' scenarios in the 2007 IPCC assessment, in which CO 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions are continued at a trajectory that maintains constant abundances.",

The issue of aviation forcings involving both positive and negative forcings and that some of them are heterogeneous in pattern makes the additivity -specifically the cancellation of climate impacts -a critical uncertainty in developing climate metrics to discuss control or mitigation strategies. There is added complexity for the impacts from NO x , aerosols, and clouds in that these depend on the location and even conditions (day-night) of the flight path (Shine et al., 2005a Bernsten et al., 2006) ",

Aviation traffic grew in terms of RPK by 22.5% over the period [2000] [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] with an increase in fuel usage of 8%, resulting in an increase in aviation RF of 14% (excluding AIC). Lee et al. (2009) estimated that total aviation RF (excluding induced cirrus) in 2005 was w55 mW m \u00c02 (23-87 mW m \u00c02 , 90% likelihood range), which was 3.5% (range 1.3-10%, 90% likelihood range) of total anthropogenic forcing. Including estimates for aviation-induced cirrus RF increased the total aviation RF in 2005-78 mW m \u00c02 (38-139 mW m \u00c02 , 90% likelihood range), which represents 4.9% of total anthropogenic forcing (2-14%, 90% likelihood range). These estimates are adopted for this assessment. Lee et al. (2009) also estimated the RF for two SRES-based aviation emission scenarios (Owen and Lee, 2006, see also Fig. 6) were also calculated (A1 and B2), which adopted the same NO x technology variants as did the IPCC (Henderson et al., 1999) in their 2050 scenarios, 'technology 1' and 'technology 2' (technology 1 assumes business-as-usual improvements in NO x control technology, whereas technology 2 places more emphasis on NO x control at some modest expense of fuel flow improvements: see Henderson et al., 1999) . The results are presented in Table 12 and represent an increase in overall aviation RF in 2050 from 2000 for scenarios A1 and B2 by factors of 4 and 3, respectively, and represent 4-4.7% of total RF (excluding induced cirrus) for the matching SRES background scenarios. Note that this analysis differs to that of IPCC (1999), who calculated a range of aviation scenarios against a single background scenario (IS92a). A wider range of aviation scenarios for analysis is currently under preparation within the EU QUANTIFY project (Owen, personal communication) .",

(2009) , there is not a uniquely correct way to do this, but it depends upon the goals of a particular climate policy. In the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC it was decided to use the GWP with a 100-year time horizon (GWP 100 ) for this purpose (see Fuglestvedt et al., 2009 , for definition and discussion of the GWP and other metrics). Recently Shine et al. (2005b Shine et al.

Note that the confidence interval for 'Total NO x ' is due to the assumption that the RFs from O 3 and CH 4 are 100% correlated; however, in reality, the correlation is likely to be less than 100% but to an unknown degree (see text). The geographic spatial scale of the radiative forcing from each component and the level of scientific understanding (LOSU) are also shown on the right .",

Also, indirect effects through modifications of clouds are not included in the metric values. The CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 eq) emissions are illustrated for the 2005 assessment of emissions, based on an IEA fuel usage for that year and using various recent emission indices from the literature. In the case of the NO x GWP and GTPs -actually the sum of the positive short-term O 3 effect, long-term negative O 3 effect, and CH 4 negative effect all divided by an appropriate CO 2 emission AGWPthere is large uncertainty arising from the small number of studies available and the disparate results, in particular, one study by Stevenson et al. (2004) which provides a negative NO x GWP 100 . For contrails and aviation-induced cloudiness (AIC), they are referenced to CO 2 emissions as a proxy. It is known that fuel (CO 2 ) is not necessarily a good proxy or scalar for contrails and AIC as the former are physically related to movements, not fuel usage. However, detailed assessments of contrail forcing with movements rather than fuel have not yet been undertaken and validated; the relationship between aviation operations and AIC is as yet, unknown.",

Technological solutions generally have a long research and development lead time to being available to airlines (and the fleet has a turnover time of approximately 20-25 years), but new operational procedures may provide an additional possibility to reduce the climate impacts of aviation. The latter may become effective in the shorter term, although infrastructural changes can also have significant lead times, depending upon the complexity of the proposed changes, (ACARE, 2001) for a more environmentally friendly future air traffic system. The ACARE goals, for instance, comprise technology development that would result in emission reductions of 50% CO 2 per passenger km and even 80% for NO x relative to year 2000 standards (although the 80% quantification is less clear as to what it refers). These are challenging objectives. Although they are principally achievable within the laws of physics, it requires important technological breakthroughs and new concepts of operation. It has been suggested that for the improvements in CO 2 , 40% will come from the airframe, 40% from the engine and 20% from improved operations. Similarly, technology objectives with regard to environmental performance of aircraft have been published for the United States (Anonymous, 2007) . In this, near term (<5 yr), mid-term (5-10 yr) and far term (>10 yr) goals and objectives have been set. In terms of fuel performance, the reference airframe/engine combination is a B737-800 with CFM56/7B engines, representative of 1998 entry into service technology: for NO x , these are referenced against the CAEP2 NO x standard. The relevant goals and objectives are presented in Table 14 . It should be noted that these are extracted from a much wider set of energy and environment R&D objectives and goals; the fuel efficiency and NO x standards are presented for comparison with the relevant ACARE Goals.",

These show the results of an exercise to project what may be possible in the future for the medium term (2020) and the long-term (2050) in terms of NO x reductions. Although such targets as described above have been set, very little work has been done on determining the impacts of such technology developments, either in terms of fleet emissions, or atmospheric impacts, other than the technology scenario variants of IPCC (1999 -see Henderson et al., 1999) within the body of that report. The turnover time of the global aviation fleet is of the order of 25 years and so any technology improvements are only taken up slowly. If airlines purchase new cleaner technology before the useful operable lifetime of the aircraft is over, these aircraft are generally sold on (commonly to developing nations or to be converted into freighters) rather than retired from the fleet. Also, the context of growth needs to be considered: in determining the emissions impact, the essential question is whether technology improvements can keep pace (or outpace) with growth in the fleet -IPCC (1999) was pessimistic over this issue, stating ''Although improvements in aircraft and engine technology and in the efficiency of the air traffic system will bring environmental benefits, these will not fully offset the effects of the increased emissions resulting from the projected growth in aviation.'' (IPCC, 1999, Summary for Policy Makers) . This issue needs to be addressed in the future to properly quantify environmental benefits: initial work was presented by Sausen and Schumann (2000) , using the IPCC (1999) scenarios (Henderson et al., 1999) , and some limited work has been performed on the CAEP MTTG/LTTG goals (Owen, personal communication) and is in progress on the ACARE targets (Lee, Schumann, personal communication) .",

This means that tradeoffs have to be considered (e.g. less NO x and fewer contrails could require higher fuel consumption, i.e. CO 2 emission). Calculating these tradeoffs is by no means simple, either technologically or in the atmospheric context. For the atmosphere, these effects occur over very different timescales (see Section 8). Examples of technological tradeoffs include: a higher bypass ratio to reduce fuel consumption and aircraft noise implies greater engine weight and diameter, which at some point will increase fuel consumption once more, moreover this makes NO x control more difficult because of the higher temperatures and pressures at the combustor inlet. New operational procedures, e.g. a deviation to avoid an ice-supersaturated region for contrail avoidance, may increase travel time and fuel consumption. However, tradeoffs are also inherent in atmospheric physics and chemistry (e.g. flying in the stratosphere will reduce contrail and cirrus formation but the residence time of emissions will increase).",

            "text": "Contrail avoidance strategies have recently been reviewed by Gierens et al. (2008) . Contrail formation is determined almost exclusively by principles of thermodynamics and the atmospheric conditions in which engine emissions are released. The theory of contrail formation can be cast into a simple equation, known as the Schmidt-Appleman criterion (Schmidt, 1941; Appleman, 1953) . The validity of the Schmidt-Appleman theory has been demonstrated and confirmed on various research flights (Busen and Schumann, 1995; K\u00e4 rcher et al., 1998a; Jensen et al., 1998b; IPCC, 1999; Schumann, 2000) . This validation proves that thermodynamics is the controlling factor for contrail formation, not the physico-chemistry of the emitted particles. An in-depth derivation of the Schmidt-Appleman theory has been given by Schumann (1996) . The Schmidt-Appleman criterion only determines whether a contrail will form or not. It does not account for contrail persistency or whether a contrail can spread out into extended contrail cirrus. Persistency is only possible if the ambient air is supersaturated with respect to ice, which means that once ice crystals are formed in the plume they can grow until either the air becomes eventually subsaturated or until the ice crystals fall (due to their weight) into lower subsaturated atmospheric layers where they will then evaporate.",

Gierens (2007a,b) showed that it would be necessary to produce a soot coating with a threshold water saturation ratio of about 1.4 for water condensation in order to decrease the maximum temperature allowing for contrail formation by 4 K. Unfortunately, this would be balanced by changes in the overall airframe propulsion efficiency expected by 2050.

One possibility is to cool the exhaust air with an additional heat exchange unit (cooled by bypass air) such that water vapour can condense in the unit. In this way the emission index of water vapour can be substantially reduced which helps to suppress contrails . A fraction of the condensed water can be injected into the combustion chamber in order to reduce NO x production. Haglind (2008) has investigated the idea to temporarily reduce the overall propulsion efficiency by using variable guide vanes in the engine fan when the aircraft flies through regions where persistent contrails are likely to form. Such a measure could decrease the threshold temperature for contrail formation by about 1.5 K, corresponding to a vertical distance of about 300 m, or 1000 ft (one flight level). In order to keep the price of such a contrail mitigation strategy low (increase in fuel consumption), such a method would have to be combined with operational measures as discussed below. Other technical possibilities to reduce contrail formation are discussed by but most of these are speculative and tend to ignore the overwhelming influence of the ambient atmosphere in contrail formation.",

Cryoplane contrails are predicted to have 1-2 orders of magnitude fewer ice crystals than contrails from equivalent kerosene-fuelled engines (Str\u00f6 m and Gierens, 2002) . Ice crystals in cryoplane contrails are predicted to be 4-6 times larger (linear dimension) than those in kerosene contrails, which renders them optically thinner and of lower duration.

Because of the variation in the tropopause height by latitude, there is no universal solution. In the mid-latitudes a solution would be to fly slightly higher, namely in the extratropical lowermost stratosphere, which is generally too dry for contrail persistence (Schumann, 2005) . Flying higher in the tropics would increase contrail formation . Charactericstic NO x of in-service engines according to CAEP NO x regulatory parameter, Dp/foo (g NO x /kN thrust at static sea-level test conditions) vs overall pressure ratio of engine. The CAEP medium term (MT) and long term (LT) technology goals are shown as lines. Fichter et al. (2005) conducted a parametric study using a climate model to determine potential responses to RF from changes in flight altitudes. Displacing overall cruise altitudes downwards, the global annual mean contrail coverage was reduced up to a maximum decrease of w45% for a 6000 ft lower cruise altitude. The global mean radiative forcing by contrails was reduced almost proportionally to the contrail coverage, with strong seasonal and regional variability. R\u00e4 del and showed that shifting the air traffic away from the most sensitive layers (10-12 km altitude) to either higher or lower levels would reduce the radiative impact from contrails. Reducing flight levels generally leads to an increase in fuel consumption, an effect that seems to be smaller for cryoplanes than for conventional planes due to different fuel storage configurations . found that relatively small changes in flight level can avoid a substantial fraction of contrails and contrail induced cirrus, due to the shallowness of the ice-supersaturation layers (which are the regions where contrails persist and spread into contrail-cirrus). A 14-month dataset of ice-supersaturated layers and their thickness distribution is shown in Fig. 30 . New developments in the capability of meteorological models, such as the ECMWF operational model, to predict ice supersaturated regions (Tompkins et al., 2007) are required to realise such a flexible strategy. Equipping a number of commercial airliners with humidity probes that are designed especially for use in the upper troposphere (including AMDAR; Aircraft Meteorological Data Reporting to the weather centres) would help aviation weather forecasts to more accurately predict ice-supersaturated regions. The analysis of was based upon an analysis of upper air in a single region of Germany, for which the majority of ice-supersaturated layers were approximately 510 m in thickness (with a standard deviation of 600 m). Other radiosonde-based studies of ice-supersaturation layers (Treffeisen et al., 2007 for Svalbard, Sweden; R\u00e4 del and Shine, 2007, for southern England) found larger average thicknesses of ice-supersaturated regions (about 1 km), despite peak values of 100-200 m in their thickness distributions. Currently, a general conclusion that only minor changes in height are necessary to avoid contrails may be inappropriate and certainly this aspect requires further and more extensive data and investigation.",

However, radical changes in aircraft design are necessary to achieve substantial reductions in CO 2 , e.g. laminar- Fig. 30 .

However, open rotor engines (sometimes called 'unducted fans') have issues over safety (blade breakage) and noise impacts that would also have to be addressed. Thermal efficiency, however, can only be improved at the expense of increased NO x production in the absence of additional efforts in combustor design. Fuel savings are also possible when long-haul flights are done in a series of stages, which would allow a reduction in the amount of fuel required to be loaded.

It is notable that the ACARE targets call for reductions in fuel consumption and NO x , such that it should not necessarily be inferred that reduced NO x always results in increased fuel: this is a tendency, rather than an inevitable fact. It will take quite some years for these novel technologies to come into service. Moreover, there is no reason that they would voluntarily be introduced by the sector in the absence of any regulatory pressure or financial incentive. Potential operational options to reduce the effects of NO x (instead of reducing NO x itself) have also been investigated. The EC project TRADEOFF investigated two kinds of options, rerouting of a part of the flights to the far north (where the tropopause is low and flights are mainly in the lower stratosphere; additionally, during polar night there is no photochemistry) and displacing the traffic up or down (\u00fe2000 ft, \u00c02000 ft, \u00c04000 ft, \u00c06000 ft).

They first performed a model simulation without aviation, then added aviation corresponding to year 2000. A comparison of these simulations showed that inclusion of aviation leads to a globally averaged increase in the ozone column (expressed in Dobson units, DU) of 0.34 DU (base case), or 0.39 DU when military aircraft operations are considered as well. Most of the increase (about 90%) occurs in the troposphere. These changes provided a base case around which sensitivity studies were conducted, changing routes and lower/higher flight levels. The additional changes in O 3 column relative to the base case of most of these scenarios was of the order 0.01-0.03 DU (positive and negative), that is, at least ten times smaller than the effect of aviation itself, and even smaller than the effect of military operations. These relations are even more pronounced when the view is on the northern hemisphere only (see Gauss et al., 2006, their Table 3 ). Flying polar routes does not have an ozone penalty; during winter times when photochemistry is reduced or absent it even brings environmental benefits, cf lower latitude flights. The operational measures discussed would nevertheless cause spatial shifts in aircraft induced O 3 production with possible consequences for radiative forcing, since O 3 is a greenhouse gas with short lifetime. Preliminary studies indicate weak radiative effects. Hence we may conclude that, according to current knowledge, O 3 effects from aircraft NO x emissions do neither favour any particular operational change in flight routings and altitudes, nor do they exclude them when for any reason (e.g. contrail avoidance) flying at different altitudes or Polar regions would turn out to be beneficial. Enhancing polar routes might have adverse climate effects for other reasons. The low tropopause at polar latitudes implies that a substantial fraction of emissions occur in the stratosphere where residence times are much longer than in the troposphere. Gauss et al. (2006) show how reactive nitrogen gases (NO y ) accumulate much more in the atmosphere when more polar routes are selected than with every other scenario investigated. As a large fraction of NO y is HNO 3 , which can be washed out by rain and falling ice crystals, such an effect can only be exploited by flying within the troposphere. Grewe et al. (2002b) found that if overall cruise altitudes were reduced, then NO x emissions increasedhowever, less O 3 was formed because of increased rates of chemical removal and washout of NO y species.",

At low power conditions, the combustion of alcohols produces organic acids and aldehydes, with attendant air quality health hazards (Saynor et al., 2003) . Nevertheless, ethanol blended Jet-A fuels show marked reductions in CO 2 , NO x , and soot formation with increasing blend rates (Eiff et al., 1992) .

For this purpose one has to firstly make a selection of potential fuels for aviation.",

Aviation kerosene has a demanding specification because of safety requirements. The possibility of using biofuels as 'blends' with either conventional kerosene or synthetic fuels has been examined recently by Daggett et al. (2006 Daggett et al. ( , 2008 . These authors note some of the difficulties associated with biofuels for kerosene blends, i.e. its lower freezing temperature at normal cruise conditions, its poorer thermal stability characteristics and storage stability over time. However, none of these difficulties were considered insurmountable. Suitable biofuels would require a large fraction of oil content, such as sunflower, soybeans or rapeseed. Daggett et al. (2006) illustrate that large areas of agricultural land would be required in order to supply demand on this basis, e.g. for a 15% biofuel kerosene blend, citing the US fleet consumption (year unspecified) of 13.6 \u00c2 10 9 US gallons, which at 15% blend would require 34 million acres of soybean production, approximating to the size of Florida State. They point out that cellulose-type feedstocks for ethanol for ground transportation purposes are far more efficient in yield per unit area.",

Wardle (2003) has also considered the usage of biofuel blends for aviation usage in a much broader context of feasibility, price, land-use, and ethics. Wardle argues that the potential large usage of agricultural land in developing nations would hamper development in terms of local agriculture and food supplies, thus bringing the ethics of a carbon-neutral flight vs. food supplies into question (see also Lovett, 2007) .

In fact, the cross-over point in the O 3 chemical production and destruction terms from NO x chemistry is at altitudes of approximately 16 km, somewhat lower than deduced for the IPCC (1999) calculations. If NO x and H 2 O supersonic emissions take place in the region of O 3 chemical destruction, this causes an O 3 decrease throughout the stratosphere and therefore in the O 3 column.

Contrails are initially linear and may result in an increase of cirrus cloud cover if they are persistent, depending upon the traffic density, and cause a local and global change in RF. The warming effect of persistent linear contrails exceeds the solar albedo (cooling) effect. The occurrence of contrails may be predicted with good accuracy. However, contrail coverage is still poorly quantified since the calculations of coverage involve normalization to observations by satellites, which do not 'see' contrails below a certain optical depth. Unfortunately, this normalization factor does not seem to be equal in all areas of the globe. Estimates of contrail RF indicate smaller values than the IPCC presented but this is largely a function of optical depth which has been reduced from 0.3 to 0.2, or less. Although some recent models compute the optical depth from the available IWC in contrails, it is prescribed in others.

Thus, a causal relationship cannot be established but a number of independent studies (that sometimes use the same underlying data) have indicated that there is an increase in cirrus cloud coverage in regions of heavy air traffic. However, recently, the usage of ISSCP data for long-term trend studies has been called into question, and if the data are corrected, studies on long-term trends in cirrus attributable to aviation should be repeated.

However, heterogeneous ice nucleation may also occur, e.g. from aviation soot in the UT/LS and there is evidence of this from field campaigns and measurements comparing 'clean' cirrus with 'polluted' cirrus. The results from one modelling study were unequivocal in that both warming effects and cooling effects may theoretically occur but the 'real' occurrence is simply unknown. There is a lack of fundamental understanding over the mechanisms that are in operation in the atmosphere. Two physically-based ice-nucleation parameterizations have been developed and implemented into a global model. The two parameterizations provide good agreement with each other in terms of ice crystal number concentration. However, similarly to a previous study, the results may produce either positive or negative RFs (10-80 mW m \u00c02 and \u00c0140 to \u00c0160 mW m \u00c02 ), depending upon the effects of aerosol concentrations on ice number concentration and size.

It has been found in some idealized GCM integrations that the global mean temperature response to the same O 3 forcing varies by latitude and altitude. More generally, some GCM experiments have shown that the pattern of temperature response to either homogeneous or heterogeneous forcing is dissimilar to the forcing and depends primarily on local feedbacks. However, forcings in these areas where local feedbacks operate may amplify the temperature response. The issue of quantification of the effects of homogeneous and heterogeneous aviation-induced forcings is an important area of work which requires further work.

            "text": "10.1. Aircraft emissions -what are the principal effects on climate and ozone depletion, and have any 'new' effects been identified?C The scope of current subsonic aviation effects on climate remain the same as those outlined in the IPCC(1999)report: positive RF (warming) arises from emissions of CO 2 , soot, H 2 O, NO x as an O 3 precursor, contrails and cirrus cloud enhancement from spreading contrails; negative RF (cooling) arises from fuel S converted to sulphate particles and NO x emissions that result in reductions of ambient CH 4 . 'New' effects being investigated include the potential RF from 'soot cirrus' (i.e. seeding of new clouds from particles or the alteration of existing cirrus properties) which may have a positive or negative radiative effect. Current subsonic aviation is considered not to contribute towards O 3 depletion in the stratosphere. C A future supersonic aviation fleet would overall cause a positive RF through emissions of CO 2 and H 2 O, and the RF of the latter would dominate in magnitude. Emissions of NO x result in either destruction or increases in O 3 , depending critically upon the height of the emission. If O 3 destruction occurs, this will also result in a negative RF. What is new since IPCC is that the destruction of O 3 from supersonic emissions of NO x appears to be more likely, since chemical reaction rates have been revised that result in the 'cross over' point between formation and destruction occurring at lower altitudes, approximately 16 km. Supersonic aircraft are unlikely to cause significant contrail formation or cirrus cloud enhancement except in the tropics. 10.2. What is the overall present-day and potential radiative forcing from subsonic aviation? C Current-day (2005) traffic has been re-evaluated over the previous estimate for 2000. This has shown an increase in traffic (in RPK) of 22.5% with an increase in fuel usage of 8.4% and RF of 14% over the period 2000-2005 (excluding AIC), Total aviation RF (excluding induced cirrus) in 2005 was w55 mW m \u00c02 (23-87 mW m \u00c02 , 90% likelihood range), which was 3.5% (range 1.3-10%, 90% likelihood range) of total anthropogenic forcing. Including estimates for aviationinduced cirrus RF increases the total aviation RF in 2005-78 mW m \u00c02 (38-139 mW m \u00c02 , 90% likelihood range), which represents 4.9% of total anthropogenic forcing (2-14%, 90% likelihood range). Calculated future 2050 aviation RF for SRES scenarios B2 and A1, show an increase of RF (excluding cirrus) by factors of 3-4 over 2000 levels, representing 4-4.7% of total RF (excluding induced cirrus) for the relevant background scenarios. 10.3. How have individual estimates of forcing changed since the IPCC Aviation Special Report? C The RFs from CO 2 , H 2 O, BC have increased with traffic growth and increased fuel usage. Estimates of RF from O 3 have not grown in proportion with traffic increases because the models have improved substantially and they predict a lesser",
