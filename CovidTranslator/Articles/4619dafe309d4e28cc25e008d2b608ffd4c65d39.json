Recently we have shown that a set of nine synthetic antimicrobial peptides, four originating from thrombin-induced human platelet-derived antimicrobial proteins named PD1-PD4 and five synthetic repeats of arginine-tryptophan (RW) repeats (RW1-5) demonstrate antibacterial activity in plasma and platelets. Using WR strain of vaccinia virus (VV) as a model virus for enveloped virus in the present study, we tested the same nine synthetic peptides for their antiviral activity. A cell culturebased standard plaque reduction assay was utilized to estimate antiviral effectiveness of the peptides. Our analysis revealed that peptides PD3, PD4, and RW3 were virucidal against VV with PD3 demonstrating the highest antiviral activity of 100-fold reduction in viral titers, whereas, PD4 and RW3 peptide treatments resulted in 10-30-fold reduction. The EC 50 values of PD3, PD4 and RW3 were found to be 40 g/ml, 50 g/ml and 6.5 M, respectively. In VV-spiked plasma samples, the virucidal activity of PD3, PD4 and RW3 was close to 100% (90-100-fold reduction). Overall, the present study constitutes a new proof-of-concept in developing peptide therapeutics for vaccinia virus infections in biothreat scenarios and as in vitro viral reduction agents.",

            "text": "Ever since their discovery, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been gaining attention as an important therapeutic intervention alternative in the field of disease prevention and care against a number of microbes (Brogden, 2005; Hancock and Sahl, 2006; Oyston et al., 2009; Zaiou, 2007) . This can be mainly attributed to the rising microbial drug resistance, associated toxicity and higher production costs involved with conventional antimicrobial drugs. As a result of intense research in this field over the last decade, approximately 20,000 AMPs have so far been listed in the AMPs database (Brogden, 2005; Hancock and Sahl, 2006; Oyston et al., 2009; Zaiou, 2007) . These peptides are either derived from nature (from microbes, vertebrates including humans) or are synthetic forms (Brogden, 2005; Hancock and Sahl, 2006; Zaiou, 2007) . Each AMP could demonstrate their antimicrobial property either on a single class of organisms i.e., anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-parasitic, anti-fungal or on multiple classes of pathogens. The mechanism of action of many AMPs include either direct microbicidal activity or indirect action by blocking or inhibiting an important pathway in the microbial life cycle (Brogden, 2005; Chan et al., 2006; Hancock and Sahl, 2006; Oyston et al., 2009; Zaiou, 2007) .",

            "text": "Though most of the currently reported AMPs are known to be either anti-bacterial or anti-fungal peptides, the number of antiviral peptides is slowly going up. Some of the AMPs that have been shown to be effective antivirals have been against viruses such as influenza A virus, severe-acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), West Nile Virus (WNV), and other viruses (Bai et al., 2007; Basu et al., 2009; Chu et al., 2008; Daher et al., 1986; Guo et al., 2009; Oyston et al., 2009; Zaiou, 2007) . Interestingly these antiviral peptides were originally either elicited due to an immune response by the host to the viral infection or virus-encoded (Bai et al., 2007; Basu et al., 2009; Chu et al., 2008; Daher et al., 1986; Guo et al., 2009; Oyston et al., 2009; Zaiou, 2007) . Besides \u2423defensins two other classes of AMPs are produced by mammalian cells: \u2424-defensins and cathelicidins (Gallo et al., 2002; Harder et al., 1997) . Between the two, cathelicidin represented by LL-37 is the most famous antimicrobial peptide that has demonstrated potent anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-fungal properties (Dorschner et al., 2001; Howell et al., 2004) . The \u2423-defensins are known to inhibit replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and influenza A virus (Daher et al., 1986) . The mechanism of action of these peptides has been suggested to involve disruption of the microbial membrane and/or penetration of the microbial membranes to interfere with intracellular functions (Brogden, 2005; Harrison and Ramshaw, 2006; Howell et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2002) . So far, the \u2424-defensins, cathelicidins (LL-37), caragenins (synthetic AMPs), peptide mimetics of \u2425-interferon, the broad spectrum antiviral EB and peptide aptamers have been shown to possess antiviral activity against vaccinia virus (VV) (Ahmed et al., 2005; Altmann et al., 2009; Harrison and Ramshaw, 2006; Howell et al., 2004 Howell et al., , 2007 Howell et al., , 2009 Saccucci et al., 2009) .",

The structure and mechanism of action of PD and RW peptides has been elucidated previously in detail and these peptides are also known to be noncytotoxic and non-hemolytic (Chan et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007; Yeaman et al., 2007; Yeaman and Bayer, 1999) . Because vaccinia virus has been used as a model to test methods of decontaminating blood products, and it has been found to be relatively resistant to solvent/detergent inactivation methods, we selected this virus to evaluate the antiviral activity of PD and RW peptides (Lin et al., 2005; Remington et al., 2004; Roberts, 2000; Wu and Snyder, 2003) . In the present study we evaluated the same PD and RW peptides that were previously evaluated against bacteria (Mohan et al., 2009a) for their antiviral activity against VV as a model virus for enveloped viruses and observed that PD and RW peptides do demonstrate antiviral activity on VV in cell culture as well as in spiked plasma.",

Final concentration of the PD peptides was at 100 g/ml whereas RW peptides were diluted to a 10 M final concentration. The inoculum was then added to B-SC-1 cells maintained in 12-well plates.

At the end of incubation period the agar overlay was removed and cell monolayer was stained with crystal violet for enumeration of virus plaques. Results were expressed in plaqueforming units (pfu)/ml. Similarly, effect of PD and RW peptides on B-SC-1 cells was analyzed by individually treating cells with each of these peptides for 2 h at the same concentrations as above. Following incubation the peptide mixture was aspirated and cells washed once with fresh DMEM.

Ideally, to be the most useful, any antimicrobial agent has to exhibit a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity viz. anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-fungal and anti-parasitic. Hence, in the present study we evaluated the efficacy of the same AMPs against vaccinia virus reduction in experimentally infected plasma. Though current virus inactivation procedures are considered highly efficient and the transmission risks due to viruses is said to be minimal, the possibility still does exist. In order to address this hypothetical but possible occurrence we selected vaccinia virus as a model virus as it poses considerable challenge in being the most resistant virus to solvent/detergent inactivation methods (Lin et al., 2005; Remington et al., 2004; Roberts, 2000; Srinivasan et al., 2006; Wu and Snyder, 2003) . Of the nine AMPs tested, three peptides (PD3, PD4 and RW3) exhibited virucidal activity against vaccinia virus. The same three peptides also exhibited potent bactericidal activity in plasma and platelets stored in plasma (Mohan et al., 2009a) . The mechanism of action of these Fig. 4 . Antiviral activity of PD and RW peptides against VV in spiked-plasma samples. Human plasma samples spiked with 10 2 pfu of VV-WR virus were incubated with PD3, PD4 and RW3 peptides individually for 2 h and tested for antiviral activity by infecting B-SC-1 cells and measuring virus titer by performing the plaque assay as described in the pre-infection experiment. Note that PD3, PD4 and RW3 treatment results in 90-100-fold reduction of viral titers (p < 0.05, indicated by *). AMPs on bacteria is well known but their mechanism of action on viruses is not yet clearly understood (Liu et al., 2007; Yeaman and Bayer, 1999) .",

The precise mechanism of action of the various AMPs is similar in some and different between other viruses. These AMPs could even have a stage-specific action on different viruses such as some may act on the extracellular virus, some may do so on the intracellular form, and some at the time of virus release (Bai et al., 2007; Basu et al., 2009; Chu et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2009 ). Our analysis of the PD and RW peptides indicate that all three peptides exhibit their antiviral activity on the virus during in vitro conditions. These peptides do not have any effect once the VV is bound to the cell membrane or during post-infection. More interestingly, pre-treatment of B-SC-1 cells with PD and RW peptides did not adversely affect virus titers suggesting that these peptides do not affect virus entry and may not be able to penetrate the cell as reported with some of the recently tested AMPs (Snyder and Dowdy, 2004) .",

While one would argue that a peptide that provides a 10fold reduction in VV titers is not an effective therapeutic agent, it could make a difference in blood transfusion settings where blood donor deferral takes care of the high titer symptomatic individuals and inadvertently collected blood from an asymptomatic individual (i.e. with very low titers). In this scenario a reduction of \u223c100 VV particles to less than 10 or, 10 particles to 0 would certainly make a difference, if the peptide can achieve a 10-fold reduction of the virus.",

Regardless of whether there is substantial risk of acquiring VV by blood products or not, the demonstration of anti-vaccinia properties of these AMPs in plasma samples is very promising. The antiviral potency of these AMPs may have potential applications, as observed with Caragenins, for topical therapy of poxviral infections (Howell et al., 2009) . Interestingly, the Caragenins are synthetic antimicrobial compounds designed to mimic the structure and function of endogenous AMPs (Howell et al., 2009) . Future application of these AMPs in other potentially challenging scenarios include treatment of various microbial infections, especially the drug-resistant ones, through systemic administration (Groneberg et al., 2004) . More pertinently, small animal testing of these AMPs would provide further evidence of such an application for these peptides and additionally reveal peptide clearance or safety aspects of these AMPs in vivo. The distinct advantage of the PD and RW peptides is that these are non-immunogenic, non-cytotoxic and non-hemolytic and thus have very minimal safety concerns. Additionally, since these AMPs are synthetic they are easy to produce in large quantities with a good product consistency. A more comprehensive analysis using these AMPs on some of the more recently emerging viruses such as H1N1, West Nile virus (WNV), SARS Co-V, CMV could bring about the value of these AMPs in virus inactivation/intervention strategies in general.",
