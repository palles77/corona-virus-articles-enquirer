This increase may be due to the persistence of virus in the CNS in the absence of B cells. In mice lacking antibody receptors or complement pathway activity, virus did not persist yet demyelination was similar to parental mice. In infected RAG1 \u00a1 /\u00a1 mice, moderately sized, typical demyelinating lesions were identi ed. Therefore, demyelination can occur in the absence of B and T cells.

Demyelination can rst be detected 6 days postinfection (d.p.i.) as very small lesions in the presence of an active infection. Large demyelinating lesions develop by 20 d.p.i. and peak around 30 d.p.i., at which time points infectious virus is undetectable although viral RNA is still present (Lavi et al, 1984b; Das Sarma et al, 2000) .

Lymphocyte-de cient SCID, RAG knockout, and irradiated mice infected with MHV-JHM rarely have even small lesions 7 to 15 d.p.i., despite high levels of virus (Wang et al, 1990; Fleming et al, 1993; Houtman and Fleming, 1996; Wu et al, 2000) . These data suggest that lymphocytes are required for robust acute demyelination. A recent reconstitution study suggests that CD4 C or CD8 C T cells can mediate MHV-JHMinduced demyelination . However, in nude mice that lack CD4 C and CD8 C T cells, demyelination still occurs . If T cells are not absolutely required for demyelination, the question remains whether B cells, the other major lymphocyte population, are important effectors in the mechanism of demyelination. Antibody production by B cells is implicated in CNS demyelination in other models of demyelination (Schluesener et al, 1987; Mastaglia et al, 1989; Ozawa et al, 1989; Lucchinetti et al, 2000) .",

MHV-A59 intracerebrall y (i.c.) in 20 \u00b9l. Demyelination was assessed in luxol fast blue-stained transverse sections by quantifying either the percent of spinal cord quadrants containing lesions or by a visual assessment of the area of white matter involved in demyelinating lesions (the scale was as follows: 1-only very small lesions detected, no larger than areas of perivascular cuffing; 2-obvious discrete lesions involving more area than in 1 and less than in 3; 3-total lesions occupy 25%-50% of the white matter in a transverse section; 4-total lesions occupy more than 50% of the white matter). By either assessment, demyelination occurs robustly in the absence of B cells (Figure 1 ). Initial demyelination was very similar to that observed in parental C57BL/6 mice. At 30 and 60 days postinfection (d.p.i.) CNS demyelination was actually signi cantly more severe in B-cell-de cient mice than in parental mice ( Figure 1 ). However, we have shown that infectious virus persists until at least 60 d.p.i. in the CNS of the muMT mice (Matthews et al, 2001) . Therefore, while the increased severity and prolonged presence of demyelinating lesions could be due to the absence of some protective mediating effect of B cells, it could also be due to direct pathologic effects of the persistent virus.",

These mice are unable to develop mature B cells and T cells. Normally, MHV-A59 infection of RAG-1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice results in death within 15 days of infection (n D 5). In one RAG-1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mouse, which was evaluated after death at 11 d.p.i., 25% quadrant demyelination was observed, although the lesions were small as would also be the case at 11 d.p.i. in a parental C57BL/6 mouse (data not shown). To enable the mice to survive to the point of maximum demyelination (20-30 d.p.i.), we treated them at the time of infection with a single dose of mouse hyperimmune serum (HIS) injected intraperitoneall y (i.p.). HIS was raised in C57BL/6 mice against MHV-A59 and was partially puri ed by 45% ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialysis against PBS. The neutralizing titer (NT) of HIS was determined by incubating serial dilutions of serum antibody with 500 p.f.u./ml A59 in DME-10 for 30 minutes at 37 \u00b1 C. NT50 was calculated as the dilution at which plaque numbers were reduced by 50%. For protection, 1 ml of HIS (NT50 of 1:5000, equivalent to the neutralizing activity found in 1 mouse 3 weeks after i.p. infection) was injected i.p. at the time of infection. Treatment with HIS enabled the mice to survive to 25 d.p.i. or later without actually clearing the virus. Antibody treatment at the time of infection has been previously shown to improve survival (Buchmeier et al, 1984) .",

To determine more precisely the nature of these lesions, spinal cords were embedded in Epon and sections were stained with toluidine blue. Compared to normal tissue ( Figure 3A) , lesions revealed active primary demyelination characterized by ballooning myelin sheaths around intact axons ( Figure 3B , C). The presence of naked axons in some of these lesions ( Figure 3D , E) is also indicative of primary demyelination. In addition to the lesions characterize d by primary demyelination, there were also multiple small round lesions characterize d by necrosis that were found predominantly in the white matter but also less frequently in the grey matter (average of 8:71 \u00a7 8:06 necrotic lesions in white matter in six of seven mice, 2:14 \u00a7 2:91 necrotic lesions in the grey matter in three of seven mice).

(Wu and Perlman, 1999) . In our studies, polyclonal antibodies from MHV-A59 immune serum were used to control the initial viral infection and thus it is possible that this could contribute to the following disease. However, the half-life of MHV-speci c monoclonal antibodies in uninfected mice has been determined to be between 8 and 13 days . Antibody in the presence of its antigen should have an even higher turnover rate. Therefore, it is unlikely that much antibody persists after acute infection. Also, transferring additional antibody during days 13-20 after infection of RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice did not result in any increase in demyelination, suggesting that antibody does not exacerbate lesions as it does in some models of EAE (Linington and Lassmann, 1987; Schluesener et al, 1987; Litzenburger et al, 1998) . In MHV-JHM-infected mice, antibody treatment at injection resulted in mice that developed symptoms but not detectable demyelination 23-47 d.p.i. (Wu and Perlman, 1999) . Therefore, we suggest that the presence of antibody at the time of infection was not responsible for the presence of demyelination seen in our experiments with RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice.",

We attempted to circumvent this problem by testing downstream mechanisms of antibody activity using transgenic mice lacking some of the pathways through which antibody normally mediates its function. Speci cally, antibody can lyse infected cells or destroy virus by (1) activating the complement pathyway; (2) inducing antibody-dependen t cell cytotoxitiy (ADCC); or (3) serving as a signal for phagocytosis. Complement activation has been implicated as the mechanism through which antibodies mediate demyelination in other models of demyelination (Linington et al, 1989; Ozawa et al, 1989; Piddlesden et al, 1993) and in MS (Lucchinetti et al, 2000) , and therefore was a pathway of particular interest. In addition, recent work has demonstrated that antibody can enhance macrophage phagocytosis of myelin in vitro (Van der Goes et al, 1999) , suggesting that FcR and opsonization could be crucial for macrophage mediated demyelination.",

The Fc\u00b0R subchain-de cient mouse (C57BL/6 background; C57BL/6JMTac-[KO]Fc\"r1\u00b0,Taconic) lacks Fc\u00b0R-I and III and therefore lacks ADCC.

The FcR double knockout (DKO) (only available on C57BL/6 \u00a3 129 background; (C57BL/6 \u00a3 129)-[KO]Fc\"r1\u00b0-[KO]Fc\u00b0R2, Taconic) also lacks the other IgG receptor, Fc\u00b0R-II, and therefore is incapable of opsonizing antibody coated cells or virus. We rst tested these mice for viral clearance and determined that at 30 d.p.i. virus is cleared from brain and liver in all 3 strains (n D 6-10 mice per group). Therefore, unlike the situation in the B-cell-de cient mice, there is no confounding factor of viral persistence in the C3-and FcR-de cient mice. Demyelinatio n was assessed by luxol fast blue staining. All three strains of mice exhibited obvious demyelinating lesions. When demyelination was quanti ed, there was no statistically signi cant difference in demyelination in any group compared to parental C57BL/6 mice ( Table 2 ). Even though demyelination in the FcR DKO mice appears lower than in wild-type mice this is not a statistically signi cant difference ( P D 0:1113 for percent quadrants demyelinating, P D 0:056 for surface area involved).

Similarly, in C57BL/6 mice, none of whom had detectable viral titers 60 d.p.i., remyelination was detected in four of four mice. When the total number of remyelinating lesions was quantitated, no signi cant difference was detected (an average of 3.8 remyelinating lesions in muMT mice, 5.5 in C57BL/6 mice, P D 0:2148). Although it would be ideal to carefully measure and compare the areas of white matter involved in remyelination versus demyelination, muMT mice maintain active demyelination at 60 d.p.i. and have markedly more demyelination than C57BL/6 mice at this time point, frustrating such a comparison. We conclude from the previous data that persistent infectious MHV is not suf cient to inhibit CNS remyelination, nor does remyelination decrease markedly in the absence of antibody, although the onset of remyelination may be delayed.",

We infected\u00b0\u00b1 T cell-de cient mice with 50 pfu MHV-A59 i.c. (n D 4) and determined that these cells are also not required for demyelination (48% spinal cord quadrant demyelination).",

In this study we determine that B cells are also not required for demyelination, nor do antibodies detectably enhance demyelination in persistently infected RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice. In complementary data, we determined that neither complement nor FcRs are necessary for robust demyelination. We have also demonstrated here the novel nding that MHV-A59 in the absence of lymphocytes can also cause demyelination, an observation that not only may account for the enhanced demyelination in B cell de cient mice but also adds another layer of complexity to the mechanism of demyelination in MHV-A59-induced disease. Therefore, although acquired immune responses and/or innate immune responses may play a role in early demyelination",
