Clinical data from nine children and their 14 families were collected, including general status, clinical, laboratory test, and imaging characteristics. All the children were detected positive result after their families onset. Three children had fever (22.2%) or cough (11.2%) symptoms and six (66.7%) children had no symptom. Among the 14 adult patients, the major symptoms included fever (57.1%), cough (35.7%), chest tightness/pain (21.4%), fatigue (21.4%) and sore throat (7.1%). Nearly 70% of the patients had normal (71.4%) or decreased (28.6%) white blood cell counts, and 50% (7/14) had lymphocytopenia. There were 10 adults (71.4%) showed abnormal imaging. The main manifestations were pulmonary consolidation (70%), nodular shadow (50%), and ground glass opacity (50%). Five discharged children were admitted again because their stool showed positive result in SARS-CoV-2 PCR. COVID-19 in children is mainly caused by family transmission, and their symptoms are mild and prognosis is better than adult. However, their PCR result in stool showed longer time than their families. Because of the mild or asymptomatic clinical process, it is difficult to recognize early for pediatrician and public health staff.",

Then the pathogen was isolated soon and named the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) on 12 January 2020 [1] And on 11 February, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced that its official classification is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus spread very fast in Wuhan. Even more unfortunate, as the Chinese Spring Festival is approaching, aggregation of large numbers of people flow caused it to spread quickly across the country and even spread to more than 100 countries [2] . The current case reports are mainly concentrated in Hubei Province and adults, but cases of children outside Hubei Province are rare. Meanwhile, the clinical characteristics of cases in Hubei Province and other provinces were significantly different. Here, we report the clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimen of nine SARS-CoV-2 infected children and their families in Jinan, Shandong province to increase awareness of this disease, especially in children.",

Sample collection and pathogen identification after admission to the hospital, respiratory tract samples including sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the patients, which were tested for influenza, avian influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia, along with routine bacterial, fungal, and pathogenic microorganism tests.

Aa an enveloped RNA virus, Cov is ubiquitous in humans, other mammals, and birds, which can cause respiratory, digestive, liver and nervous system disorders [5, 6] . To date, six CoVs have been known to cause human infection [7] . Among them, two zoonotic viruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were responsible for serious outbreaks: in China in 2002-2003 [8, 9] Of particular concern, our observations found that all the children were diagnosed after their families, which indicated that they were infected by the household contact. However, after an epidemiological investigation, we found that six adults (42.9%) had a definite or suspicious contact history and six families (42.9%) contacted them were infected, while the other two patients (14.3%) denied any epidemiological history. Among them, the father of case 9 did not contact anyone who came back from Wuhan or Hubei, but also denied contact with any person with respiratory symptoms. At the same time, through official investigations, they did not find that someone was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection on the vehicle he was travelling on, prompting the virus to spread. In addition, from the official information, more and more patients can't find the clue of infection and more and more cluster outbreak showed that no contact, no close communication and even never go out the door. So, we think that these phenomena maybe suggest that: (1) the virus spreads very strongly and the transmission of the virus may not be limited to contact, droplets and airborne transmission, and aerosol transmission may also exist, which was similar to SARS [11] . (2) the virus may be carried asymptomatically after infecting the human body but can infect other people.",

            "text": "In China, the SARS outbreak of 2003 is still impressive, because the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak infected 8422 individuals leading to 916 deaths in eight affected areas [12] . During the SARS outbreak, there were less children patients and the symptoms are significantly milder in children than in adults [13] [14] [15] [16] . Similarly, the official data to date suggest that children infected with the SARS-CoV-2 are relatively rare too [17] , and their overall symptoms are significantly mild. The main reasons for this phenomenon may be: (1) the range of activities for children is relatively small, they are mainly infected by their adult families. And, as an RNA virus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus maybe also is prone to mistakes in replication, mutating, and surviving without recognition by the immune system, but can also cause a decline in virulence. So, children are infected with second or third generation or even fourth generation virus and they get milder symptoms; (2) it may be because of differences in the immune responses of children compared to adults. One hypothesis is that the innate immune response, that is the early response that is aimed broadly at groups of pathogens, tends to be more active in children. The innate immune system is the first line of defense against pathogens. Cells in that system respond immediately to foreign invaders. The adaptive immune system, by contrast, learns to recognize specific pathogens, but takes longer to join the battle. If the innate immune response is stronger in children exposed to SARS-CoV-2, they may fight off infection more readily than adults, suffering only mild symptoms. Other coronaviruses, including SARS and MERS, also show this pattern [18] . (3) The number or function of ACE2 receptors in children is not as good as in adults. Recently, one studies had investigated the role of the ACE2 receptor and found that the SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-coronavirus receptor ACE2 and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for entry into target cells [19] . As we know, the distribution of ACE2 receptors in different organs and populations is different. Therefore, it may be that different receptor levels or functions in children and adults lead to different severity of illness. (4) Other reasons: such as children have fewer basic diseases, children smoke less, and children have strong self-healing capabilities and so on.",

(2) Viruses coexist with humans and have seasonal onsets, such as flu influenza viruses. The first is the best outcome of the current situation, but the second possibility is very large. If, as we analyzed above, many people, especially children with mild or no clinical symptoms carry the virus but do not develop the disease, however, the virus spread very strongly, it may lead to the silent spread of the disease and leading to major losses. Therefore, the Chinese government will face greater risks after school starts and work resumes. And, clinicians, especially pediatricians, need to be vigilant to prevent widespread spread of the disease.
