However, the mechanism of bile acid-dependent PEC replication is unknown. Understanding of bile acid-mediated PEC replication may provide insight into cultivating related human noroviruses, currently uncultivable, which are the major cause of viral gastroenteritis outbreaks in humans. Our results demonstrated that while uptake of PEC into the endosomes does not require bile acids, the presence of bile acids is critical for viral escape from the endosomes into cell cytoplasm to initiate viral replication. We also demonstrated that bile acid transporters including the sodiumtaurocholate co-transporting polypeptide and the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter are important in exerting the effects of bile acids in PEC replication in cells. In summary, our results suggest that bile acids play a critical role in virus entry for successful replication.",

            "text": "Calicivirus is a non-enveloped virus with a diameter of 27-35 nm and possess a single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome of 7-8 kb. The family Caliciviridae consists of five genera: norovirus, sapovirus, lagovirus, vesivirus and nebovirus (Carstens, 2010) . Noroviruses and sapoviruses cause gastroenteritis in humans and animals, whereas lagoviruses and vesiviruses mostly infect animals causing a variety of diseases (Green et al., 2001) . Norovirus infection usually occurs as epidemic gastroenteritis outbreaks and affects 10-21 million people in all age groups in the U.S. each year (CDC, http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/trends-out breaks.html). Therefore, norovirus is recognized as the major etiological agent of foodborne and waterborne infections in humans. Human noroviruses have remained uncultivable to date, and it has been a major hindrance to research on viral pathogenesis and development of vaccines and antivirals for norovirus infection. Cultivable caliciviruses include murine norovirus (MNV) (Wobus et al., 2004) , porcine enteric calicivirus (PEC) , feline calicivirus (FCV) and Tulane virus (primate calicivirus) (Farkas et al., 2008) . PEC was first isolated in primary porcine kidney cells ) and subsequently in continuous porcine kidney cell line (LLC-PK cells) in the presence of the intestinal content (IC) (Parwani et al., 1991) . Later it was found that bile acids in IC were responsible for PEC replication . The requirement of IC or bile acids in virus replication in cell culture is a unique phenomenon for PEC and implies that biologically important interactions may occur between bile acids and PEC in the intestines . Bile acids were also shown to play important roles in the replication of some viruses propagating in the bile rich organs, such as the liver and the intestines. Bile acids were reported to promote hepatitis B and C virus replication (Chang and George, 2007; Chhatwal et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2010; Scholtes et al., 2008) but to inhibit rotavirus replication (Kim and Chang, 2011) . Unlike these viruses which are cultivable without addition of bile acids, PEC replication is completely dependent on the presence of bile acids in the medium. While it was previously reported that protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and/or innate immunity elicited by IC or bile acids is involved in supporting PEC replication in LLC-PK cells (Chang et al., 2002 , the detailed mechanism of bile acids in supporting PEC replication is yet to be determined.",

Bile acids are the active constituents of bile and essential for solubilization and absorption of dietary lipids in the digestive tract (Johnson, 1998) . In addition to their role in lipid absorption, bile acids are also involved in various metabolic processes, such as cholesterol and lipid homeostasis, and inflammatory process by acting as signaling molecules (Schaap et al., 2014) . Primary bile acids, such as cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugates, are synthesized in the liver and excreted into the intestinal tract (Johnson, 1998) . Subsequently, secondary bile acids, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugates, are produced by intestinal bacteria (Johnson, 1998 2 to 30 mM in the small intestines (Dowling, 1973; Northfield and McColl, 1973) , and majority of bile acids are reabsorbed in the small intestines and returned to the liver (enterohepatic circulation) (Johnson, 1998) . PEC replicates primarily in the proximal intestinal tract (duodenum and jejunum) where bile acid concentrations are high. In LLC-PK cells, any bile acid, with the exception of hydrophilic ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and its conjugates, support PEC replication . Among them, glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) and taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) support PEC growth at concentrations as low as 50 mM .",

The viral RNA levels in the cells incubated with GCDCA increased steadily from 4 h to 12 h PI (Fig. 1A) . However, there was no indication of virus replication over time in the cells without GCDCA. Viral titers determined by the TCID 50 method at each time point were in line with the viral RNA levels in all samples ( Fig. 1A ): viral titers were comparable in the cells incubated with or without of GCDCA up to 4 h PI, but viral titers increased from 4.8 to 6.04 log 10 TCID 50 /ml at 8 and 12 h PI, respectively, only in the cells incubated with GCDCA (Fig. 1A ). In line with these results, extensive CPE started to appear at 12 h PI, and progressed to 490% of cells at 16 h PI only in the virus-infected cells incubated with GCDCA. At 16 h PI, virus titers of PEC-infected cells incubated with GCDCA further increased to 7.5 log 10 TCID 50 /ml, while those of virus-infected cells lacking GCDCA remained low at 3.2 log 10 TCID 50 /ml (Fig. 1B) .

At 1 h PI, little immunofluorescence staining for PEC was observed in the cells incubated with GCDCA under confocal microscopy ( Fig. 4A ). However, positive staining for PEC was observed in the cytoplasm in the cells incubated without GCDCA, or cells incubated with GCDCA and chloroquine at 1 h post-transfection (Fig. 4A ). In these cells, confocal microscopy analyses demonstrated colocalization of virus with rab7, a late endosomal marker (Fig. 4A , panels h and p). At 4 and 6 h PI, viruses colocalized with rab7 were still observed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4B ). In the next experiments focusing on the first one hour following virus infection, we observed that fluorescent virus particles gradually decreased over time during 5-60 min PI in the cells incubated with GCDCA (Fig. 4C ). ImageJcolocalization (MBF) analysis and JACoP plugin was used for colocalization analysis. The thresholds were set by the Costes' Auto threshold method and the thresholded Mander's split colocalization coefficients were determined. The split coefficient for colocalization of virus particles (green) with rab7 (red) in the confocal images were found to be 40.90 for all experiments indicating a high degree of colocalization of viral particles with rab7. These results demonstrated that PEC is able to reach the late endosomes without the help of bile acids, but viral escape from the late endosomes requires the presence of bile acids. Our finding on the negating effects of chloroquine in bile acid-supported PEC replication was confirmed by virus titration of the cells treated with chloroquine (data not shown).",

            "text": "Enteric caliciviruses are important diarrheal agents in humans and animals. In humans, norovirus, an enteric calicivirus in the Norovirus genus, is responsible for the majority of diarrheal outbreaks of food-and water-borne viral gastroenteritis (Green, 2007). However, inability to grow human norovirus in cell culture has been a major obstacle in vaccine and antiviral drug development. PEC is an enteropathogenic calicivirus which requires IC as a supplement in the medium for virus culture Parwani et al., 1991) . It was previously reported by our group that bile acids are the active factors in IC essential for PEC replication . The effects of bile acids in enhancing or inhibiting the replication of some viruses in the bile-acid rich organs, such as hepatitis B and C viruses and rotavirus, have been reported, suggesting that bile acids may act as important factors in modulation of viral replication (Chang and George, 2007; Chhatwal et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2010; Kim and Chang, 2011; Scholtes et al., 2008) . However, absolute requirement of bile acids for viral replication in cell culture is unique for PEC. In this study, we investigated the effects of bile acids on the replication cycle of PEC by time-of-addition study, gene knockout and agonists study, and confocal microscopy. First, one-step PEC replication kinetics with high MOI of virus and bile acids was established for virus entry and the time-of-addition studies (Fig. 1) . The time-of-addition study showed that the critical time points when bile acids are most effective are the early stages of virus replication (Fig. 2) , demonstrated by the increase in viral RNA levels and viral proteins when CDCA or GCDCA was added within 2 h following virus infection. The following PEC RNA transfection study showed that bile acids are not required at the virus replication steps subsequent to the release of virus genome into the cytoplasm, suggesting that bile acids are involved in the very early stages of virus replication cycle (Fig. 3) . It is of note that we previously observed that transfection of LLC-PK cells with PEC RNA did not result in the detection of virus replication when the transfection was performed without bile acids . We speculate that the discrepancy between the previous and current results may have arisen from different experimental condition. In the previous study, low virus RNA level and multi-cycle virus replication (up to 120 h PI) allowed virus detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) only in the cells incubated with bile acids through subsequent multi-cycle virus replication. In this study, higher virus RNA concentrations and a single round of virus replication were used to determine which virus replication steps require the presence of bile acids. When we repeated the transfection study using low RNA concentrations, we found that virus in the transfected cells incubated without bile acids failed to propagate through multi-cycle virus replication. The results from our single-round virus replication study using PEC-transfected cells suggest that bile acids are not required after virus genome is released into the cytoplasm.",

            "text": "Since our observation indicated that bile acids are involve in the early virus replication steps preceding virus replication in the cytoplasm, we then studied virus trafficking in PEC-infected LLC-PK cells incubated in the presence or absence of GCDCA by confocal microscopy at various time points following virus infection. Without GCDCA in the medium, PEC was observed to remain in the late endosome even at 6 h PI. In contrast, PEC gradually disappeared from the late endosome during the first hour of virus infection (Fig. 4A-C) . We did not track the fate of the trapped virus particles in the cells incubated without GCDCA at more than 6 h PI, but it seems that the trapped viruses remain infective for at least 2 h PI, based on our time-of-addition study. Nonetheless, viruses that remain in the late endosomes until they fuse with lysosome would be degraded. We also found that inhibition of endosomal maturation by chloroquine abolished the effects of bile acids in PEC replication, as observed with a confocal microscope (Fig. 4A , panels m-p). This result indicates that endosomal low pH is indispensable for the function of bile acids in PEC escape from the late endosome. Inhibition of endosomal acidification by chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 in cell culture supplemented with bile acid led to significantly reduced PEC replication (at MOI of There are numerous reports that viruses entering the host cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis must escape from the endosomes before fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes occur. This endosomal escape is critical in the viral entry process and virus replication, and viruses utilize different mechanisms to translocate to the cytoplasm or other cellular compartments to initiate viral genome replication (Grove and Marsh, 2011; Gruenberg and van der Goot, 2006; Marsh and Helenius, 2006) . Many enveloped viruses that utilize host cell's endocytic pathway, such as influenza viruses, coronaviruses and alphaviruses, have a fusion protein which is activated at a low-pH environment of the endosomes and undergoes fusion with the endosomal lipid membranes (Grove and Marsh, 2011) . In addition to a low-pH in the late endosomes, some viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Ebola virus also require their fusion proteins to be cleaved by cellular proteases residing in the endosomes, such as cathepsin L and B, to expose a putative fusion domain (Chandran et al., 2005; Cote et al., 2011; Grove and Marsh, 2011) . Non-enveloped viruses do not undergo fusion but have distinct but less known mechanisms for endosomal escape. For reovirus, endosomal cathepsin activity is important during virus entry, since it removes the outer-capsid protein s3, exposing the viral membrane-penetration protein M1 for uncoating and endosomal escape (Baer et al., 1999; Ebert et al., 2002 Ebert et al., , 2004 Johnson et al., 2009) . For parvovirus, a lipolytic enzyme (phospholipase A2, PLA2) at the N-terminus of virus structural protein VP1 is implicated in catabolization of phospholipid in the endosomal membrane, leading to translocation of viral genome in the cytoplasm (Farr et al., 2005; Zadori et al., 2001) . In this study, our results suggest that bile acids play a crucial role in the endosomal escape of PEC. This is the first report that bile acids are involved in virus trafficking during the entry events.",

The LLC-PK cells we used in this study for PEC infection originated from porcine renal proximal tubular cells and support PEC replication in the presence of bile acids. This cell line expresses mRNAs of NTCP and ASBT, two important sodium-dependent bile acid transporters, and we found that gene silencing of either transporter mRNA led to a significant reduction in PEC replication (Fig. 5A) . NTCP and ASBT are expressed in various cell types such as hepatocytes, intestinal enterocytes, renal proximal tubular cells and function to maintain the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids in the body (Dawson et al., 2009; Trauner and Boyer, 2003) . These bile acid transporters reside on the cell plasma membrane and recycle back to the cell surface once internalized (Alpini et al., 2005; Grune et al., 1993; Mukhopadhayay et al., 1997; Reymann et al., 1989) . Previously, our group reported that PKA signaling pathway is important in bile-or IC-mediated PEC replication (Chang et al., 2002 . Since recycling of bile acid transporters is regulated by cAMPdependent PKA pathway (Alpini et al., 2005; Grune et al., 1993; Mukhopadhayay et al., 1997; Reymann et al., 1989) , it seems plausible that the importance of cAMP-dependent PKA pathway in bile acid-mediated PEC replication stems from its involvement in recycling of bile acid transporters in the cells. However, further study is required to clarify the roles of PKA pathway in bile .5 labelled goat-anti-rabbit antibody (red) and FITC labelled goat-anti-swine antibody (green). Nuclei were stained with sytox orange (5 mM) (pseudo colored blue), and merged images for PEC and Rab7 were prepared. In the merged images, colocalization of PEC (green) and Rab7 (red) appears in white by using ImageJ.",

In addition to acting as a bile acid transporter, NTCP is also identified as a functional receptor for human hepatitis B and D viruses (Seeger and Mason, 2013; Xiao et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2012) . We found that NTCP and ASBT do not function as receptors for PEC, since silencing of these genes did not abrogate the internalization of PEC into LLC-PK cells. We also found that the effects of bile acids in supporting PEC replication is not mediated by bile acid receptors FXR or TGR5. FXR or TGR5 are important mediators of various biological functions elicited by bile acids, including bile acid homeostasis, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, innate immunity, and inflammation (Dawson et al., 2009) , and FXR was reported to be involved in the replication rotavirus (Kim and Chang, 2011) . Based on our findings, we propose a model for bile acidmediated PEC replication (Fig. 6 ). In this model, PEC enters the cells through endocytosis and travels to the late endosomes, from where virus or virus genome must escape with the help of bile acids to initiate replication. In the absence of bile acids, virus fails to exit the late endosomes and is degraded later. The mechanism of endosomal escape of PEC and the roles of bile acids in the process remain to be elucidated with further study. This model does not exclude the potential direct or indirect effects of bile acids during later stages of virus replication cycle and host-virus interactions (such as innate immunity). In summary, we demonstrated for the first time that bile acid-supported PEC replication is associated with viral endosomal escape. This novel finding may provide insight into mechanisms of endosomal escape for caliciviruses and other viruses.",
