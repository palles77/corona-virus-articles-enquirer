            "text": "The objective of this study was to evaluate morbidity and mortality in preweaned dairy heifer calves based on different health, feeding, and management practices, as well as environmental factors. This study was conducted as part of the calf component of the National Animal Health Monitoring System's Dairy 2014 study, which included 104 dairy operations in 13 states. The calf component was an 18-mo longitudinal study focused on dairy heifer calves from birth to weaning; data were collected on 2,545 calves. The percentage morbidity for all calves enrolled in the study was 33.9%. Backward elimination model selection was used after univariate screening to determine which management practices and environmental factors significantly affected morbidity and mortality. The final morbidity model included birth weight, serum IgG concentration, ventilation type, and average temperature-humidity index (THI) during the preweaning period. After controlling for other independent variables in the model, calves born at a higher birth weight had a lower predicted risk of morbidity than calves with a lower birth weight. An increase in serum IgG concentration was associated with decreased morbidity. Calves housed in positive-or cross-ventilated systems had a 2.2 times higher odds of developing disease compared with calves housed in natural ventilation systems. Average THI during the preweaning period was inversely correlated with morbidity; as THI increased, the predicted morbidity risk decreased. The percent mortality for all calves enrolled in the study was 5.0%. The final mortality model included birth weight, serum IgG concentration, amount of fat/day in the liquid diet, and morbidity. After controlling for other independent variables in the model, calves born at a higher birth weight had a lower risk of mortality. An increase in serum IgG concentration decreased the risk of mortality. The odds of mortality were 3.1 times higher in calves fed \u22640.15 kg of fat/d in the liquid diet compared with calves fed \u22650.22 kg of fat/d. The odds of mortality were 4.7 times higher in calves that experienced any disease throughout the preweaning period than in calves with no disease. In summary, morbidity and mortality were both associated with birth weight and serum IgG concentration. Additionally, morbidity was associated with ventilation type and average monthly THI, and mortality was associated with amount of fat per day in the liquid diet and morbidity.",

            "text": "The preweaning phase of dairy heifer calves represents a critical period in the life of replacement females, as they are very susceptible to disease and death. Calves are at the greatest risk of dying during the first 21 d of life (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986; USDA, 1994; Wells et al., 1996 Wells et al., , 1997 . Overall, the health status of a preweaned dairy heifer can greatly affect lifelong production, including growth, reproductive efficiency, and milk production. An association between calfhood bovine respiratory disease complex and decreased milk production, reproduction, and early culling has been demonstrated (Stanton et al., 2012) . Furthermore, morbidity, disease treatment, and mortality in preweaned calves result in a forfeiture of genetic potential for future herd improvement (Wells et al., 1997; Swali and Wathes, 2006) . The economic loss of replacing a dairy heifer due to disease and death is significant. Although raising a dairy heifer is expensive, this cost generally does not surpass the cost of purchasing a springing heifer (McGuirk, 2008) . Therefore, understanding relationships between management practices and calf health is essential for minimizing morbidity and mortality and enhancing future production.",

Colostrum and blood samples were shipped together on ice to USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories (Ames, IA). Blood samples were centrifuged at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories and serum was separated. Serum and colostrum samples were then accumulated and shipped in bulk to the Saskatoon Colostrum Company (Saskatoon, SK, Canada) for testing. Colostrum samples were tested for IgG concentration using radial immunodiffusion and Brix score using a digital Brix refractometer. Serum samples were tested for IgG concentration using radial immunodiffusion and for total protein and Brix score using a digital Brix refractometer. Blood samples collected within 24 h of birth or after 7 d of age were excluded from this analysis. A complete description of the methods used for Brix scoring and IgG determination can be found in Shivley et al. (2018) .",

This is likely due to changing temperatures and possible inclement weather, which results in a calf spending more time outside its thermoneutral zone. Wiseman et al. (1976) showed that the incidence of pneumonia increased during inclement weather events. Additionally, harsh weather events that include rain, snow, and high levels of moisture have been shown to increase the susceptibility of calves to diarrhea (Perez et al., 1990; Larson and Tyler, 2005; Carroll and Forsberg, 2007) . Calculated incidence rates demonstrated that most calves developed digestive signs at approximately 2 wk of age. Diarrhea at 2 wk of age is often seen in at-risk calves, given that the infectious causes of diarrhea, such as bovine rotavirus and coronavirus, have a short incubation period and tend to cause diarrhea in calves to peak at 1 to 2 wk of age (Steele et al., 2004; Dhama et al., 2009) . Additionally, calves developed respiratory signs that peaked at approximately 5 wk of age. Respiratory disease seen at this age is common in at-risk calves, because viral and bacterial agents, such as respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza type 3, associated with pneumonia in calves are normally found in calves over 4 wk of age (Lorenz et al., 2011) .",

It is recommended that calves be fed through the course of the diarrheic event to help maintain caloric intake and to add fluid volume and electrolytes to supplemental fluid administration (McGuirk, 2008) .

Previous studies reported that calves with a birth weight that deviated from the mean (i.e., both heavy and light calves) were more likely to have digestive disease (Par\u00e9 et al., 1993; Fallon et al., 1987) . In the current study, calves were required to live beyond 24 h to be enrolled in the study; therefore, it is possible that calves with severe dystocia due to heavy birth weights that could be at a higher risk for morbidity and mortality were excluded from the study. Nonetheless, for low-birthweight calves, the majority of fetal growth is determined by the maternal uterine environment (Penrose, 1952) . Thus, low birth weight could be due to a restricted supply of nutrients available to the developing fetus, which may occur due to maternal age and body condition at the time of conception and maternal nutrient supply during the gestation period (McCrabb et al., 1991; Bauer et al., 1998; McMillen et al., 2001; Osgerby et al., 2003a,b) . Wolfenson et al. (1988) demonstrated that heat stress in dams resulted in calves with lower birth weight. Additionally, the size of the placenta may inhibit fetal growth, especially in late gestation, when maximal fetal growth occurs (McMillen et al., 2001; Mellor and Stafford, 2004) . Low birth weight due to intrauterine restrictions of nutrients and space may be a potentiating factor to increase morbidity and mortality in smaller calves. A post-uterine factor associated with low-birth-weight calves that may increase the likelihood of morbidity and mortality is a greater body surface-area-to-mass ratio. This greater ratio allows increased heat dissipation and increases energy requirements directly after birth, resulting in a compromised ability to acquire passive transfer (Par\u00e9 et al., 1993; Mellor and Stafford, 2004; Monteiro et al., 2014) . However, management interventions, such as drying off all calves at birth, providing dry housing, and immediately providing high-quality colostrum, may mitigate most environmental risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality in low-birth-weight calves. Nonetheless, ensuring that cows are healthy throughout the gestation period and providing high-quality nutrients will promote healthy newborns with decreased morbidity and mortality and increased lifelong production measures, such as fertility and milk production (Linden et al., 2009) .",

            "text": "Although birth weight is a difficult variable to control on the farm, serum IgG, which was directly associated with morbidity and mortality, can be controlled through the implementation of a quality colostrum feeding program (DeNise et al., 1989; Donovan et al., 1998; Furman-Fratczak et al., 2011) . Because calves are born agammaglobulinemic, they rely on consumption and absorption of maternal immunoglobulins via colostrum to fight infections, especially during the first few weeks of life (Gulliksen et al., 2008) . Absorption of colostral immunoglobulins can be measured via serum IgG concentration. In this study, as serum IgG concentration increased, the likelihood of disease and death decreased. Several other studies support this result, demonstrating that calves with a serum IgG concentration \u226510g/L had decreased morbidity and mortality during the preweaning period (Arthington et al., 2000; Gulliksen et al., 2008; Godden et al., 2009) . Calves with a serum IgG concentration <10 g/L are considered to have failure of passive transfer and are at a higher risk of disease and death. However, survival analyses of morbidity and mortality by serum IgG concentration in this study demonstrated that serum IgG concentration has a dose-dependent effect. Therefore, increasing the minimum serum IgG concentration target to 15 g/L may reduce morbidity and mortality, compared with the current 10 g/L industry standard. Additionally, serum total protein level and serum Brix score, which act as on-farm proxies for serum IgG concentration, also demonstrated a dose-dependent effect in the survival analyses for morbidity and mortality. Thus, if the industry standard for serum IgG concentration is increased, it is recommended to increase the target of serum total protein to 5.4 g/dL and serum Brix score to 8.6%. Housing ventilation was another significant predictor of morbidity. Calves housed in ventilation systems other than natural ventilation were more likely to develop disease. Previous research associated enzootic pneumonia with poorly ventilated housing conditions, because poor ventilation can increase pathogen density (Nardell et al., 1991; Callan and Garry, 2002) . Additionally, Lago et al. (2006) demonstrated that factors related to ventilation, including air changes per hour, were associated with the prevalence of calf respiratory disease, and decreased ventilation was associated with increased alleyway bacterial counts. Ultimately, increasing natural ventilation rates and providing a hygienic environment with decreased pathogen loads, regardless of the provided ventilation type, will help reduce morbidity, especially in regard to respiratory disease.",

Averaging THI throughout the calf's preweaning period allowed us to better account for seasonal variability across the United States. Because the THI was an average per month throughout each calf's preweaning period, extremely high or low temperatures outside the thermoneutral zone (and likely resulting in heat or cold stress) were not observed. However, past research demonstrated that both cold stress and heat stress affect the immune and stress responses of the body, specifically elevating pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, ACTH, and cortisol (Frank et al., 2003; Hangalapura et al., 2006; Dahl et al., 2016) . Additionally, Godden et al. (2005) demonstrated that calves were more likely to receive treatment for clinical signs in the winter and summer months. Nonnecke et al.

Research has demonstrated the importance of adipose tissue in mammalian survival-it provides energy, a source of heat and water, and thermal insulation (Young, 1976) . Furthermore, early research regarding milk replacers in dairy calves demonstrated that higher fat replacers produced a lower incidence of scours and improved rates of gain (Lister, 1971; Leaver and Yarrow, 1972; Appleman and Owen, 1975) . Thus, it would be expected that calves with limited fat intake would have lower energy levels available to fight infections, such as scours, and be at greater risk for cold and heat stress, and more likely to die during the preweaning period.",

Additionally, most calves were tested for Cryptosporidium and Giardia; however, there was no association between the enteric protozoa and morbidity.

However, areas for improvement remain, including properly treating calves with antibiotics, feeding calves through scours events, and classifying causes of death. To continue reducing morbidity and mortality, the minimum serum IgG concentration target should be increased to 15 g/L compared with the current industry standard of 10 g/L. Additionally, more research should be conducted on factors that were shown to affect morbidity and mortality in this study, especially birth weight, housing ventilation, THI, and amount of fat fed per day in the liquid diet.",
