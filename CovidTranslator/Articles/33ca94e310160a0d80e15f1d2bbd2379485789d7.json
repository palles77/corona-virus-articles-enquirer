The book also introduces George MacDonald's model of malaria transmission and Australian scientist Frank MacFarlane Burnet's insights about certain shortcomings of a classical medical education. Burnet published \"Biological Aspects of Infectious Disease\" after recognizing that MDs trained in the first half of the 20th-century often lacked knowledge of zoologic and environmental factors contributing to human infections.

That's a difficult one.\" \"What about bats-considering the deadly viruses they sometimes carry?\" \"In the course of researching the book I spent time with bats, helping people like John Epstein and Aleksei Chmura trap and handle them, look for bat-roosts. It gave me more empathy. The one thing I regret [in \"Spillover\"] is that I didn't more clearly and explicitly say: 'Look, dear readers, do not demonize bats. Bats are enormously important and perform important ecosystem services.'\" \"What are your thoughts about eradicating infectious diseases?\" \"There's an absolute-ness about eradication that I distrust, that makes me uneasy . . . In the case of zoonoses, of course, we can't eradicate unless we cure or eradicate the reservoir host. We don't want to pave this entire planet to make it cleaner and safer for humans because it will be not only un-helpful, it will be boring, lonely, and ugly.\" \"I do have sympathy for people who say: we've eradicated smallpox from the human population, now let's eradicate polio. How can you not be in favor of that? But zoonoses are much more complicated. As Rick Ostfeld [of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Milbrook, NY] once said to me: 'Infectious disease is inherently an ecological system.'\" \"What was your scariest moment researching the bookand your most poignant?\" \"The scariest moment was when-about a-third into it-I started waking up in the middle of the night thinking: how am I going to do this? I've signed a contract; my editor and my agent are counting on me to deliver an encyclopedic and entertaining treatment of zoonotic diseases, including AIDS and Ebola. How in the world am I going to get access? Then, someone said: 'Do you want to go with me to southern China and look for SARS?' 'Do you want to go to Bangladesh and draw blood from macaques?' . . . and the moment passed. Then it was just a matter of, well, don't fall off the roof.\" \"The most poignant moment was when I went back to that village in the Congo with Prosper Balo and he told me the story of when Ebola struck his village. Balo [an expert gorilla tracker] was off working in the forest where gorillas were dying; meanwhile his wife [whose sister, two brothers, and child died of Ebola] was being shunned, people wouldn't touch her money, wouldn't sell things to her. He lost members of his gorilla family; then he went back to his compound where he lost members of his human family. At that moment I thought: here is a complete human being. And I am completely interested in his story.\"",
