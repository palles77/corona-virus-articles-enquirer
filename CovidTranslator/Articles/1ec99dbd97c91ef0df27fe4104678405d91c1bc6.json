The nucleotide sequence encoding the entire N gene open reading frame (ORF) of Chinju99 was 1326 bases long and encoded a protein of 441 amino acids with predicted M r of 49 kDa. It consisted of 405 adenine (30.5%), 293 cytosine (22.1%), 334 guanines (25.2%) and 294 thymines (22.2%) residues. The Chinju99 N ORF nucleotide sequence was 96.5% and 96.4% homologous with that of the CV777 and Br1/87, respectively. The Chinju99 N protein revealed 96.8% amino acid identity with that of Br1/87 and CV777, respectively.

On the other hand, nucleocapsid (N) protein (55\u00b158 kDa) is known as a basic phosphoprotein associated with the genome [1, 3, 8, 9] , which can be the target for the accurate and early diagnosis of PEDV infection by molecular techniques.

In the present study, the N gene of the PEDV Chinju99 was cloned and sequencing was done for the cDNA clones. The resulting sequence data showed a single ORF of 1326 nucleotides encoding a protein of 441 amino acids with M r of 49 kDa predicted by PEPSTATS program. Chinju99 N gene also had 96.8% amino acid sequence identity with that of CV777 and Br1/87 [10] , although there were 14 amino acid mismatches recognized. Therefore, the Chinju99 N protein revealed the same features for the nucleotide and putative amino acid sequences in the CV777 and Br1/87, although PEDV N protein is known to possess M r of 55\u00b158 kDa by polyacrylamid gel electrophoresis [8, 9] .",

Trials were done to analyze the nucleotide and putative amino acid sequences of the Chinju99 N gene comparing to those of other PEDVs. However, we could elucidate molecular properties of the N gene by mere comparison to those of CV777 and Br1/87, because the full-length nucleotides of the PEDV N gene have been determined only in these strains. Nevertheless, it was recognized that Chinju99 N gene has the minor differences in the structural features of putative protein compared to those of CV777 and Br1/87. This can be the feasible information for the development of genetically engineered N protein for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of PEDV infections in Korea. Moreover, the genetic information gained from the Chinju99 N gene can be used for diagnostic work such as PCR and nucleic acid hybridization. To our knowledge, this is the first published report on the full-length nucleotides and molecular characteristics of the N gene of Korean PEDV isolates. and Br1/87 [10] : Only the amino acids of CV777 and Br1/87 which mismatched the Chinju99 sequence were included; *, translation termination; seven potential threonine (T)-or serine (S)-linked phosphorylation sites by protein kinase C were underlined; seven potential T-or S-linked phosphorylation sites by casein kinase II were denoted in italic.",
