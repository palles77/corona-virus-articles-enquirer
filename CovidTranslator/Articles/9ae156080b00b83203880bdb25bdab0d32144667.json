            "text": "Using feminist political economy, this article argues that companions hired privately by families to care for residents in publicly funded long-term care facilities (nursing homes) are a liminal and invisible labour force. A care gap, created by public sector austerity, has resulted in insufficient staff to meet residents' health and social care needs. Families pay to fill this care gap in public funding with companion care, which limits demands on the state to collectively bear the costs of care for older adults. We assess companions' work in light of Vosko's (2015) and Rodgers and Rodgers' (1989) dimensions for precariousness. We discuss how to classify paid care work that overlaps with paid formal and unpaid informal care. Our findings illuminate how companions' labour is simultaneously autonomous and precarious; it fills a care gap and creates one, and can be relational compared with staffs' task-oriented work.",

            "text": "In 2003 there was a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Toronto so serious that it made international headlines. During the outbreak, all hospitals and long-term care (LTC) facilities enacted quarantine measures and visitors were restricted entry. Privately paid 'companions' hired directly by families and estates to provide one-on-one care were not permitted on site because they were classified as visitors, not staff, even though the facility was their work site. Before the crisis, LTC management had not paid attention to how many companions worked directly for residents; however, companions became highly visible during the quarantine. At one facility companions were lined up outside the large atrium windows unable to get in, while the residents were seated in wheelchairs inside the atrium unable to get out. It was particularly remarkable because the size of the companion workforce rivalled the paid staff complement. According to a physician who worked at the LTC facility during the quarantine, nearly half of its 'workforce' had disappeared. At the time, this facility was atypical amongst peer organizations for its heavy reliance on companion labour as well as for the public way in which this shadow workforce was revealed. SARS pushed facility management to 'see' this otherwise invisible workforce. Management subsequently enacted policies, training, and quasi-staff-like requirements and hired a companion coordinator; yet despite these changes, the facility held no liability for companions' working conditions such as hours, rates of pay, and holiday time or their rights to workers' compensation in the case of illness or injury. Companions remained privately paid employees doing much of the same work as the care aides employed in this publicly funded and unionized facility, but without the same protections or benefits.",

Most of the 120+ residents are cared for by a companion for at least a few hours per day, and some residents have 24-hour companion care to augment or replace the facility's publicly funded care. However, much has changed at other facilities across the city because the ubiquity of companion care has increased. The rise of this form of care has occurred in the context of under-staffing, the key challenge in Ontario's LTC sector as identified by a wide variety of stakeholders (Banerjee et al., 2012; Daly and Szebehely, 2012) . Some families with financial means have chosen to employ companions to overlap with facility care as one strategy to address the care gap resulting from the under-staffing of publicly funded care.",

Work is performed in people's 'homes', which are formal workplaces and places where families and volunteers perform informal care work. In this article we use the example of companion care provided in LTC to highlight in-between, liminal and invisible labour because their labour is juxtaposed between the public, market and household spheres, is privately paid care provided in publicly funded settings, and is care provided mostly in private behind closed bedroom doors in quasi-domestic conditions (e.g. informal payment, lack of benefits).",

Following the literature review and the method and methodology section describing the studies, we present findings about the content and conditions of companions' care work. We draw on a regional and an international study to address the following questions: Who are companions and why do families employ them? What work is performed by companions? In what ways is companions' work precarious or liminal? What are the risks of companion care? We assess companions' work in light of Vosko's (2015) and Rodgers and Rodgers' (1989) dimensions for precariousness. We discuss how the setting (e.g. in private homes, in LTC, in short-term hospital) and the funding (e.g. public or private) contexts affect the work. We also discuss how we should classify care work that is paid but overlaps with formal and informal care. Our findings illuminate how companions' labour is simultaneously autonomous and precarious, lucrative and under-paid, liminal, invisible and permanently transitional.",

            "text": "The concept of precarious employment is widely used, though its meaning and measurement are heavily debated (Kachi et al., 2010) . Thus, precarity has been called 'shadowy and contested' (Vosko et al., 2009: 1) . Vosko (2011: 194) notes that it is 'work for remuneration characterized by uncertainty, low income, and limited social benefits and statutory entitlements'. Despite on-going debate, Vosko (2015) notes that the term can refer to a host of employment security deficiencies, and it is increasingly understood as labour market insecurity that extends beyond older debates about a precarious-secure jobs dichotomy to include multiple forms of labour market insecurity that can define any job (Vosko, 2015) . Precarious employment is defined by gender, nationality, race, ethnicity, (im)migrant status, (dis)ability and age inequalities (Bakan and Stasiulis, 1997; Vosko et al., 2009; Zeytinoglu and Muteshi, 2000) . As Cranford and colleagues note, '\u2026 the growth of precarious employment is gendered and racialized ' (2003: 6) . Building on Rodgers and Rodgers' (1989) work, Vosko (2015) argues that four key dimensions are central to measuring precarity. 'Degree of certainty' captures the impacts of short-term contracts, short-term employment relationships, and risk of termination. 'Regulatory protection' considers whether workers are protected by labour standards, statutory and social employment benefits, and whether regulations are enforceable. 'Control over the labour process' reflects the work organization and its execution. Finally, 'income level' measures the total direct and indirect income that workers receive, including their wages and payment as well as government transfers and government-and employer-sponsored benefits. Measurement of precarious labour requires documenting and contextualizing labour force conditions, including part-time, temporary and agency work. The ways in which precarious work is experienced in different sectors requires on-going scholarly attention.",

Invisible work may become visible in LTC because it juxtaposes the public and private realms. The liminality construct presents interesting conceptual room to examine invisible work, private work performed in public work spaces, and publicly funded work performed in private work spaces. For instance, Zadoroznyj (2009) examines the position of publicly funded 'mothercarers' going into private homes to provide care, while Daly et al. (2015) examine privately funded companions going into publicly funded facilities to provide care to residents. Zadoroznyj refers to these workers as 'strangers' who are welcomed by some new mothers for the anonymity they afford when providing intimate care such as laundry after the birth of a baby, and unwelcome by others for not being as familiar as family in these intimate family spaces. Daly et al. (2015: 260) focus on how companions occupy a place that is within the 'blurry lines between formal and informal, paid and unpaid care work' in LTC.",

            "text": "Over a hundred years ago, liminality was used by ethnographer Van Gennep (1909) to discuss ancient cultures' transitional periods or rites of passage. Turner (1969) re-cast its usage to involve any period of change, but especially those involving rites of passage. Contemporaneous scholars have drawn on Turner's concepts to refer to spatial and temporal transitions. For instance, Shortt (2015) uses liminality to show how hairdressers use 'transitional' work spaces such as lifts, door-ways, stairwells, toilets and cupboards because these spaces have been neglected in the literature. A small number of cross-disciplinary scholars have re-introduced liminality to refer to subjects who are in spaces that are between two worlds, whether through choice, circumstances or a combination of the two (Daly et al., 2015; Giladi, 2010; Sweeney, 2009; Zadoroznyj, 2009 ). Sweeney (2009: 570) , in referring to student tree planters, notes that '[l]iminality denotes a time/space where subjects are \"betwixt and between\", neither \"in\" nor \"out\" and separated from familiar space, routine, temporal order or hegemonic social structures'. Indeed, as Daly et al. (2015) argue, liminal work as a construct can link formal and informal, paid and unpaid care work. In a similar way, Baines (2006) notes how paid care workers in the social services sector often perform unpaid work -in an 'endlessly stretchable' way -to meet an under-funded organization's needs. Deserving of more attention are the blended and messy ways in which care work is at once formal and informal, paid and unpaid.",

We conducted 203 key informant interviews with staff (including managers, nurses, personal support workers, housekeepers and dietary aides), family, volunteers, students and paid companions. Work observations occurred (7 a.m. to 11 p.m.) on LTC units; field notes captured sights, smells, sounds and events. Interviews were verbatim transcribed. Field notes and interviews were coded with what Boyatzis (1998: 184) describes as thematically 'encoding qualitative information' and feminist political economy theory (Armstrong et al., 2001; Mutari, 2000) with a focus on the intersections between paid and unpaid work, the work's gendered assumptions, and the experiences of providing and paying for care. We generated a broad theme list after the interviews were completed, based on the literature and our field observations, and added themes that surfaced in the data.",

This positioning created serious tensions and sometimes toxic relations between companions and staff while it secured companions' employment, but it did little to affect their liminal status in a workplace that was not formally their own. Companions also protected their positions by ensuring they chose their own replacements while on holidays or days off.

Our findings show that companions are paid privately to work in places where they are not employees, in publicly funded workplaces that are also private households. Their work bridges a gulf between informal and formal care because they are paid by families to work for a single resident to perform care that extends the limits of the publicly funded care on the one hand, but that duplicates the staffs' formal care work on the other. It is both a replacement and a substitute, much like the work of the 'mothercarers' described by Zadoroznyj (2009) . Informal unpaid care is performed by families, but the same activities are also performed by companions paid to extend the reach of familial care. Interestingly, companion care also overlaps with the paid work of the staff, but unlike staff, companions are not normally a part of the formal care team. As Lyon and Glucksmann (2008) note, the contemporary study of work must look at the same labour activity and analyse how it is formal and informal, paid and unpaid. Paid companion care overlaps with unpaid and informal family care and with paid formal staff care. We argue that paid companions' labour is performed in the spaces between formal and informal care, or even at the margins of informal care.",

Like most precarious work, it is done without even the most basic of labour protections, but it is curiously carried out with high degrees of autonomy. It is often invisible and is not counted because it is performed behind closed doors in places that are both public and private spaces. We found that insufficient staffing and austere public funding led to a care gap that differed depending on the jurisdiction, which in turn created both families' desire for paid care and paid staff's tolerance of companions.

We also found that companions performed emotional and social care, like family would, and engaged families with photos and phone calls that also served as a bulwark against job insecurity. But families also imposed on companions to 'feel' as though they were family and pressured them, for example, to devote precious holiday time to aid in the service of the resident. Therefore, our study found that unlike staff, companions had few workplace protections, enjoyed greater autonomy and performed care work at a much slower pace and in a more relational manner. Most companions had more than one client during the week, so as to retain access to the building following a resident's death -an indicator of companions' precarious position.",

            "text": "In what ways is companions' care work liminal and invisible? Based on our findings, and using feminist political economy as our theoretical framework, this study found that companions' labour was both liminal -situated between formal and informal care -and largely invisible, like most domestic labour. In some places more than others this liminal and invisible labour force redressed the paid staff care gap due to state austerity measures. The concept of liminality captures the contradictions inherent in companions' invisible positioning between the public, the household and the market spheres (Clement and Vosko, 2003; Mutari, 2000) . The space occupied by companions also highlights the limits of state, private household and market roles in care. Families' use of companion labour limits the state's responsibilities to collectively bear the costs of care for older adults, which further individualizes this work to families, shifts the work organization and the conditions of work for paid staff, and creates more care inequality between residents. Companions lack power while working in places where they are not employed; yet they also retain power because families are reliant on their presence to watch over staff. Overall, their work is highly autonomous despite occurring in a sector that is prone to heavy regulation (Daly et al., 2015) . There is demand for the work because it fills a care gap, but it also de-stabilizes the sector because it removes pressure to risk sharing the costs of better staffing by the public sector. It also removes pressure to improve working conditions and lessen precarity for parttime or contract care aides who desire full-time work and benefits.",

Furthermore, in jurisdictions, especially in North America, where care aides' work is highly task oriented, companions can provide relational care for the individual. Hiring companions to work in public, often unionized, facilities but under the table and outside of the reaches of state protections makes this work permanently transitional, liminal, invisible and precarious. As a result, there are risks for companions, families, staff, facilities and, importantly, for the residents with whom they work.",
