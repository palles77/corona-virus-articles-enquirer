In the United States, respiratory diseases account for 75% to 80% of all acute morbidity. Viral infections are the greatest contributors to this morbidity rate, causing approximately 80% of respiratory illness. Many of these infections produce mild, selflimited symptoms of the upper respiratory tract. Lower respiratory tract illness (LRI), particularly that associated with the presence of crackles or wheezes on physical examination or as parenchymal disease on a chest radiograph, accounts for the majority of severe disease. One third of children develop LRI in the fi rst year of life. 1 Childhood asthma may be initially diffi cult to discriminate from LRI in some patients; indeed, both conditions can be present simultaneously.",

            "text": "Although 60% or more of LRIs are primarily viral 2 (Table  33 -1), the concern often remains as to whether bacterial infection is present, as either a primary problem or a complication of viral infection. Of the bacteria, Streptococcus pneumoniae is by far the most common, followed by Haemophilus infl uenzae and Staphylococcus aureus. Clinical features that suggest these causes include an abrupt onset or a change in symptoms over a few to several hours, toxicity, and radiographic fi ndings of parenchymal consolidation, pleural effusions, or both. White blood cell counts are of variable help, but extreme leukocytosis (>20,000 cells/mm 3 ) or increased neutrophil band counts (>1500 cells/mm 3 ) suggest possible bacterial involvement. However, such fi ndings are not absolute; severe viral infections can produce leukocytosis and variable shifts to the left. Conversely, overwhelming bacterial pneumonia can present with ominous leukopenia. The magnitude of fever is thought by some to be helpful in determining the possible presence of a bacterial infection, but viral LRI can also provoke high fevers, which may persist for several days or longer. Serum levels of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein have shown the most promise to date in distinguishing serious bacterial infection from virus-caused disease, but these fi ndings remain untested in respiratory diseases. 3, 4 Other nonviral agents include Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, deep mycoses, and Pneumocystis jirovecii. C. trachomatis pneumonia is most common among infants between 2 weeks and 6 months. Characteristically, the onset of respiratory symptoms is insidious over several days, the infant is usually afebrile, and air trapping with interstitial infi ltrates is often apparent on chest radiographs. Symptomatic M. pneumoniae infections are uncommon in children younger than 5 years; however, they frequently cause pneumonia among children in the 5-to 19-year age group. 5 C. pneumoniae infections appear to follow clinical and agespecifi c patterns similar to those of M. pneumonia infections, but more data are needed before such a comparison can be confi rmed. 6 Tuberculosis and deep mycoses should be considered when the symptoms and radiographic abnormalities insidiously progress over days to weeks. Finally, P. jirovecii infections are suggested in patients who have progressive hypoxemia (often without signifi cant hypercarbia), alveolar infi ltrates, and signifi cant risk factors such as congenital or acquired immunodefi ciency, malignancy, and severe protein malnutrition.",

Initially described in patients with LRI in the Netherlands, 10 hMPV has now been identifi ed in pediatric and adult patients with LRI worldwide. hMPV is in the same subfamily of Paramyxoviruses as RSV and displays the same syncytial formation in cell culture. Although comparative prevalence studies are diffi cult to evaluate due to differences in sensitivity of detection methods, hMPV certainly appears to cause a signifi cant portion of LRI worldwide. In one prospective 25-year study, hMPV prevalence was 12% in nasopharyngeal samples from patients with LRI, compared with 15% RSV, 10% parainfl uenza virus, and 5% infl uenza virus. 11 Infection usually occurs during childhood, causing hMPV seropositivity in up to 52% of 24-month-old infants and 100% of 5-year-old children. 12, 13 Like RSV, hMPV has a seasonal pattern, causing its greatest impact in the winter months. Coinfection with hMPV and other respiratory viruses occurs and appears to increase the severity of illness. 14 Clinically, hMPV infection is similar to RSV disease and includes mild upper respiratory tract disease, infl uenza-like symptoms (including fever, myalgia, and vomiting), croup, pneumonia, and, most commonly, bronchiolitis. 11,13 Patients typically present with symptoms commonly seen with RSV but, in general, have less severe signs of respiratory distress (Table 33 -2).

Nasal congestion, cough, and subsequent respiratory distress often do not appear until a day or two after the onset of systemic symptoms. Although the mean overall duration of the acute illness (3 to 7 days) is somewhat shorter than with RSV or parainfl uenza viruses, the convalescent phase often lasts several weeks, and rapid deterioration as a result of bacterial superinfection can occur at any time in the course. Rarely, patients may develop a rapidly progressive, overwhelming viral pneumonia resulting in death within 2 to 3 days after the initial onset ( Fig. 33-3) . Pandemic infl uenza has occurred three times in the past century, causing unusually severe, hemorrhagic pneumonia and millions of deaths. The pathogenicity of these pandemics appears related to a lack of neutralizing serum immunity against the pandemic strain, presumably due to antigenic drift of its hemagglutinin antigen. 20,21 Diagnosis and basic management are similar to those described for RSV and parainfl uenza viruses. Oral amantadine hydrochloride is somewhat effective in treating infl uenza A but is ineffective against infl uenza B. If begun within 24 to 48 hours of onset and continued for 5 to 7 days, it may reduce the duration of fever and systemic symptoms and result in a more rapid improvement of peripheral airways function. 22 It also has use as prophylaxis in high-risk children during infl uenza A outbreaks. A related drug, rimantadine, is also effective and appears to produce fewer adverse effects than amantadine. 22, 23 The rapid development of viral resistance to both amantadine and rimantadine has been observed, particularly when either medication is used in households for the simultaneous treatment of symptomatic infection and contact prophylaxis. 24 The neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir and oseltamivir) can also signifi cantly reduce duration and symptom severity of infl uenza, if begun within 30 hours of onset.

Initial symptoms of fever and malaise develop and reach maximal severity over the fi rst 12 to 24 hours and are followed by additional respiratory symptoms.

Infl uenza A (H5N1) infection in humans is characterized by fever, severe respiratory symptoms, lymphopenia, and a high risk of death. 27 In 2004, at least 44 persons were infected and 32 died; most had direct contact with infected poultry. However, a probable case of person-to-person transmission 28 raises fears of an impending pandemic because few humans will have any immunity against this strain. Chemoprophylaxis with the neuraminidase inhibitors appears to have some benefi t, but concerns about emerging viral resistance may limit their use. Thus, such preventive measures as vaccine discovery and prospective poultry screening and culling are critical. Unfortunately, only a few countries have developed infl uenza pandemic plans and even fewer have the economic and social resources to pursue vaccine development and antiviral stockpiling. Perhaps the greatest impact so far has been the fi nancial reality of domestic poultry destruction in those countries hardest hit by this virus. 29",

Fortunately, they produce LRI only occasionally and sporadically. Adenoviral pneumonia, most commonly caused by types 3, 5, and 7, initially progresses much like the pneumonia described for RSV and parainfl uenza viruses (see Fig. 33-1) , but the illnesses can be extremely severe and can last for several weeks. Adenovirus types 3 and 7 have been associated with epidemics of LRI. 30 Risk factors for severe, potentially lethal disease include immunocompromise, congenital heart disease, and protein-calorie malnutrition. During the acute phase, chest radiographs often reveal extensive consolidation, particularly in perihilar areas ( Fig. 33-4) . These fi ndings, along with a frequent occurrence of high fevers, leukocytosis, and multisystem involvement, can make it diffi cult to discern such infections from bacterial conditions. Other systemic manifestations that sometimes develop are hepatic dysfunction (including Reye's syndrome 31 ), encephalopathy, coagulopathies, measles-like exanthems, and diarrhea. 32 The diagnosis is confi rmed best by the detection of the virus in tissues such as lung aspirate or biopsy specimens. Because asymptomatic shedding from the throat or gastroin-testinal tract is common in young children, isolation of the virus from the throat must be regarded as diagnostically supportive but not confi rmatory, and isolation from stools or rectal swabs needs to be interpreted even more cautiously. Serologic studies of paired acute and convalescent sera obtained at least 2 weeks apart may further aid in confi rming the diagnosis. Rapid detection has been used, including immunofl uorescence and immunoenzyme assays. Such methods are generally quite specifi c, but sensitivity ranges between 30% and 60%.",

In addition, 29% of 51 acute respiratory episodes experienced by the siblings of these patients were also associated with HCoV.

Respiratory symptoms begin 2 to 7 days after the prodrome and initially include a dry, nonproductive cough and mild dyspnea, accompanied by lung high-resolution CT fi ndings of ground-glass consolidations. Further progression occurs 8 to 12 days later and ranges from a \"mild cough variant\" with persistent intractable cough to the more common \"moderate to severe variant\" with hypoxia and dyspnea. Ten percent to 20% of hospitalized patients will require intubation and mechanical ventilation, often heralded by subtle, progressive decreases in oxygen saturation. Recovery begins approximately 14 to 18 days after onset of symptoms. 43, [46] [47] [48] Diagnosis of SARS-CoV is available by use of culture and RT-PCR, although the sensitivity of culture is lower than RT-PCR. Specimens obtained 10 days from symptom onset are associated with the highest yield, correlating with the timing of peak virus load. Serologic assays for SARS-CoV include immunofl uorescent assays, ELISA, and Western blot assays; however, none is sensitive early enough in the disease course to be useful for rapid diagnosis and thus should be used for paired acute and convalescent-phase serologic diagnosis. 43 Treatment of SARS remains largely supportive and aimed at those patients who develop respiratory failure. Barotrauma appears to be a frequent complication of SARS-CoV infection, leading to pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum in 20% to 34% of ventilated patients. 49 Thus, a \"lung protective\" ventilation strategy is recommended for those patients on mechanical ventilation. Other therapeutic interventions have included use of ribavirin, interferon \u03b1, lopinavirritonavir, and such immunomodulatory therapies as corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasma exchange. 43 However, no controlled trials have demonstrated benefi t in outcome or mortality related to these. Despite the high mortality and devastating impact of SARS-CoV in 2002, the story of its emergence serves to describe a victory due to the worldwide public health measures used successfully to bring the outbreak under control.",

CMV pneumonitis commonly presents as a primary pulmonary process characterized by fever, tachypnea, and progressive pulmonary distress. Diffuse, bilateral pulmonary infi ltrates are generally seen on chest radiographs. The diagnosis can be made by culture of the virus from bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid or from lung tissue, although detection of increased viral load by nucleic acid detection methods in the setting of LRI is strongly suggestive. The advent of prophylaxis with intravenous ganciclovir or oral valacyclovir in high-risk patients has greatly reduced the incidence of CMV during the fi rst 3 months after bone marrow transplantation. 62 Ganciclovir is less effective in treating CMV pneumonitis in patients after disease is clinically apparent.",

VZV is spread by aerosolized respiratory secretions, and the initial round of viral replication occurs in the lungs. A primary wave of viremia then occurs and is followed by further viral replication in lymphatic tissue. Characteristic cutaneous lesions erupt after a secondary viremia. Varicella pneumonitis generally develops 2 to 5 days after the outbreak of a rash. 63 The clinical and radiographic manifestations vary. Asymptomatic miliary lung lesions (especially in adult varicella) may later become apparent as calcifi ed foci. In others, a mild interstitial pneumonia is present, which may be overshadowed by a severe bacterial pneumonia caused by such organisms as group A streptococci or S. aureus. These are often accompanied by effusions and empyemas and can be extremely difficult to treat. Varicella alone can cause a progressive, lethal pneumonia in immunocompromised patients.",

Transplacental transfer of maternal antibody specifi c for VZV is minimal if the onset of illness occurs fewer than 5 days before birth. Thus, if maternal varicella develops within 5 days before to 2 days after delivery, systemic disease and pneumonitis can develop in the neonate, with an estimated case-fatality rate of 5%. 64 The diagnosis of varicella in normal hosts is generally made by clinical observation. Culture or immunofl uorescence staining of vesicular lesions is important in immunocompromised hosts to rule out disseminated herpes simplex infections. Serologic antibody tests are useful for assessing immune status. \u03b3-Globulin preparations containing high titers of anti-VZV activity are effective in preventing varicella if given soon after exposure. Neonates and immunocompromised children are candidates for this treatment. 64 Acyclovir and other related agents are the drugs of choice in treating high-risk patients and reduce the severity of illness if administered within 2 days of the outbreak of a rash. Fortunately, a live VZV vaccine has resulted in a signifi cant reduction of primary varicella and its complications. 65 Like the other herpesviruses, EBV produces life-long infections and causes a variety of clinical syndromes, including infectious mononucleosis, central nervous system illnesses, malignant lymphoproliferative diseases, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Pneumonitis, pneumonia and pleural effusion can occur as part of primary EBV infection but are uncommon, although perhaps underdiagnosed. In a group of 113 normal children with documented EBV-induced mononucleosis, 6 children, all younger than 4 years, developed pneumonia during the illness. 66 Pneumonia was selflimited in all cases. The diagnosis of primary EBV infection is made on clinical grounds in conjunction with serologic tests for heterophil antibody or IgM anti-VCA antibody.",
