In recent years, several co-signaling pathways have been identified [12, 13 ]. An explosion of research into costimulation has resulted in incredible growth in the understanding of the molecular structures involved, and has provided the basis for further understanding of T cell costimulatory pathways and the subsequent development of therapeutic interventions. This review describes in detail the structure of co-signaling molecules in the context of their function and therapeutic application. Predictably, as research progresses, gradually increasing understanding of the structure of costimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules will provide further impetus to the study of the biological function of costimulatory pathways, and encourage their therapeutic application.",

Surprisingly, it has become evident that T cells also take part in regulating innate immune responses during the early phases of infection [14] . A review by Tong Hong and Fu Yangxin entitled \"A new role for T cells in dampening innate inflammatory responses\" [15] provides us with a new perspective on T cells. This review cites evidence suggesting that conventional T cells temper acute innate inflammation, and elaborates upon the recent finding that effector and memory T cells dampen the hyperactive inflammasome during the late phase of the primary response or upon secondary challenge. These unexpected results suggest that T cells within the adaptive immune arm regulate innate responses; thus, shedding new light on the evolution and interplay between the innate and adaptive immune systems [16] . Further understanding of the underlying mechanisms will facilitate the clinical diagnosis and treatment of various infectious and inflammatory diseases.",

Many excellent Chinese immunologists have emerged over recent years and have produced remarkable work in the field, including the structural basis and mechanisms of immune recognition, immunological therapy, influenza, and inflammasomes. The work on Toll-like receptors, which mediate both innate and adaptive immune responses by recognizing molecules expressed by invading pathogens and eliciting immune responses, has greatly enhanced our understanding of inflammation [18, 19] . Studies of influenza have also helped the fight against the threat of flu [20] [21] [22] [23] .

However, constantly increasing input and increased attention means that immunology in China should experience a leapfrogging in terms of development in the near future. We hope that this special focus on immunology in this issue of SCIENCE CHINA Life Sciences will help to achieve this.",
