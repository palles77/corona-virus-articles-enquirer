To develop standard WNV diagnostic tools that can differentiate WNV from Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to WNV envelope (E) protein were produced and characterized by isotyping, reactivity with denatured and native antigens, affinity assay, immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and epitope competition, as well as cross-reactivity with JEV. Two of the MAbs (6A11 and 4B3) showed stronger reactivity with E protein than the others (2F5 and 6H7) in Western blot analysis. 4B3 could bind with denatured antigen, as well as native antigens in indirect ELISA, flow cytometry analysis, and IFA; whereas 2F5 showed highest affinity with native antigen. 4B3 and 2F5 were therefore used to establish an antigen capture-ELISA (AC-ELISA) detection system. The sensitivity of this AC-ELISA was 3.95 TCID 50 /0.1 ml for WNV-infected cell culture supernatant. Notably, these MAbs showed no cross-reactivity with JEV, which suggests that they are useful for further development of highly sensitive, easy handling, and less time-consuming detection kits/tools in WNV surveillance in areas where JEV is epidemic.",

However, neither a specific treatment for WNV infection nor a preventive vaccine is available at present. In nature, WNV exists in an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and birds, with birds being the principal amplifying host (Glaser, 2004) . The rapid spread of WNV is most likely caused by the migration of infected wild birds after contact with pools of Culex mosquitoes (Malkinson et al., 2002; Rappole et al., 2000) . As the clinical symptoms of WNV infection are non-specific compared to those of other encephalitis viruses, diagnosis relies mainly on laboratory tests.",

Three days after the last boost, the titer of polyclonal antiserum was assessed using indirect ELISA (described below) with EDIII as antigen. The mouse with the highest titer was chosen to harvest splenocytes. Separated splenocytes were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells at a ratio of 5:1 using 50% (w/v) polyethylene glycol, according to a previously described protocol (Kohler and Milstein, 1975) . The hybridoma cells were obtained and subsequently cloned by limiting dilution. The cell lines that produced specific antibodies were subcloned successively 3-5 times by limiting dilution to ensure monoclonality and stability. Positive clones that secreted high-titer EDIII-specific antibodies in indirect ELISA were further identified. The immunoglobulin subclass was determined using SBA Clonotyping System/AP kit (Southern Biotechnology Associates). Four positive cell lines (6A11, 4B3, 2F5 and 6H7) were used to generate ascites in BALB/c mice and MAbs were purified by protein A or protein G chromatography, according to manufacturer's protocols (Pharmacia). The concentration of purified MAb was determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce Biotechnology).",

Many methods have been developed for WNV diagnosis, in which serological testing is the primary method (Dauphin and Zientara, 2007) . However, the cross-reactivity of the antibody response against flaviviruses limits the specificity of these tests (Calisher et al., 1989; Niedrig et al., 2007) . As JEV is endemic in Southeast Asia, the cross-reactivity between WNV and JEV should be considered in WNV surveillance. MAbs with strong and specific reactivity to WNV antigens are the most attractive option for the development of standardized diagnostic tools. WNV EDIII-reactive MAbs have been reported by several groups Oliphant et al., 2005; Sanchez et al., 2005; Throsby et al., 2006) . Beasley and Barrett (2002) have described four MAbs that reacted with recombinant EDIII protein in a non-reducing Western blot assay and one of them bound to JEV. However, there is no further investigation of these MAbs expect for the neutralization activity. Furthermore, a panel of EDIII-specific MAbs has been identified by ELISA and neutralization assay, but the cross-reactivity of these MAbs with JEV has not been examined (Throsby et al., 2006) .",

The reason that 6H7 lost its specific reactivity with EDIII protein in indirect ELISA after purification may have been caused by the low pH of the elution buffer during purification, which probable destroyed the antigen binding site of this antibody. The binding affinity of MAb 2F5 (1.8 \u00b1 0.3 nM) was comparable to that of MAb E16 (3.4 nM) and CR4353 (6.5 nM) (Throsby et al., 2006) , however, 4B3 and 6A11 showed a much lower K D (407.1 nM for 4B3 and 692.5 nM for 6A11). One reason is that the SPR analysis was performed by using refolded EDIII protein. The binding activity of 2F5 to refolded EDIII was higher than 4B3 and 6A11 in other assays, so the lower K D of 4B3 and 6A11 is reasonable. 4B3 and 6A11 seemed to bind with overlapping epitopes in competitive ELISA, but they showed different binding ability with the same antigen for denatured EDIII or E protein, as well as for native E protein or intact WNV particles. This may be explained by the different binding affinity constants of 4B3 and 6A11 with EDIII. It is interesting that 4B3 could bind to both denatured and native antigens. Crystal structural analysis of EDIII protein (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2003; Nybakken et al., 2005; Volk et al., 2004) has shown that EDIII is an Ig-like domain with seven \u2424-strands, which constitute its main structure. Single \u2424-strand is linear in native as well as in denatured protein. If 4B3 happens to recognize one of the seven \u2424-strands, it is highly likely that 4B3 shows reactivity with both denatured and native antigens. This needs further investigation. In the present study, none of the MAbs showed protective activity in microtiter-based neutralization assays (data not shown). One possible reason is the natural scarcity of EDIII-specific neutralization antibodies. This is comparable with other study. In the 119 WNV-specific MAbs that have been cloned from three WNV-infected patients, only 10 exhibited neutralizing activity, and as few as two targeted domain III (Throsby et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "Of the many techniques developed for the rapid diagnosis of viral infections, the AC-ELISA is a sensitive and specific method that is capable of large-scale screening in surveillance programs. It also offers advantages over more traditional antigen detection methods, such as isolation in cell culture and plaque titration, which rely on the inoculation of samples into cells, or RT-PCR, which is expensive and prone to contamination. The availability of MAbs with strong reactivity to the target antigen is a crucial component for AC-ELISA development. Because of the possible presence of both conformational and linear antigens from live viruses or denatured samples, the recognition of the two forms of antigens by MAbs is extremely important for successful detection (He et al., 2007) . To obtain the strongest signal for WNV detection by the AC-ELISA, different combination of MAbs were evaluated. It was found that a combination of MAbs 4B3 and 2F5 gave the highest signal. This is reasonable because, among the four MAbs, 4B3 showed the strongest reactivity with denatured antigen, and 2F5 had the highest affinity with native antigen. Therefore, the combination of MAbs 4B3 and 2F5 might contribute greatly to the sensitivity of the AC-ELISA. The detection limit was 3.95 TCID 50 /0.1 ml for WNV-infected cell culture supernatant in the present study. This sensitivity is comparable with that for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Che et al., 2004; Shin et al., 2006) , and higher than some AC-ELISAs for other arboviruses (Hall et al., 1987; Hildreth and Beaty, 1984) . Sensitivity comparisons with other previously published AC-ELISAs for flaviviruses are difficult to make, because previous studies have used plaque forming units as endpoints to assess infectivity level (Hunt et al., 2002; Tsai et al., 1987) .",
