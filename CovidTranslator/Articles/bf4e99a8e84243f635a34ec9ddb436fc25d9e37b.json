Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, average degree of substitution of mannose (DSM) 4)/siRNA complex had the potent RNAi effects in both NR8383 cells, a rat alveolar macrophage cell line, and JAWSII cells, a mouse dendritic cell line, through adequate physicochemical properties, mannose receptor (MR)mediated cellular uptake, and efficient phagosomal escape of the siRNA complex. In addition, cytotoxic activities of the siRNA complexes with \u03b1-CDE (G3, DS2) and Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4) were almost negligible up to a charge ratio of 100 (carrier/siRNA).

For example, siRNA can be condensed into nanoparticles, which protect it against premature degradation, transport it across cell membranes, and facilitate its escape from the endolysosomes, leading to the effective release of siRNA to the cytoplasm of target cells, where it can enter the RNAi pathway (6, 7) . In terms of delivering the nanoparticles to the proper target cells, receptor-mediated delivery is a promising approach for achieving target specificity and avoiding non-specific interactions (8) . The mannose receptor (MR), a transmembrane protein of the C-type lectin family, is exclusively expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs; macrophages, dendritic cells) and liver endothelial cells, etc. (9) . MRs can undergo high-affinity binding to infectious agents containing terminal mannose residues, triggering their transport into endocytic pathways, and resulting in MHC presentation and subsequent T cell activation (10) . This receptor system can bind to mannose-appended nanoparticles, leading to their rapid internalization within membrane-bound vesicles (11) . The introduction of mannose to various non-viral delivery carriers, such as polyethyleneimine (12) , lipid (13) , gelatin (14) , and chitosan (15) , have been shown to provide an APCtargeting ability and high transfection efficiency.",

            "text": "Cyclodextrins (CyDs) have recently been applied to gene transfer and oligonucleotide delivery (16) (17) (18) . CyDs are cyclic (\u03b1-1,4)-linked oligosaccharides of \u03b1-D-glucopyranose containing a hydrophobic central cavity and hydrophilic outer surface, and they are known to be able to act as novel host molecules (19) . The most common CyDs are \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-CyDs, which consist of six-, seven-, and eight-D-glucopyranose units, respectively. We previously reported the potential use of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) starburst dendrimers with CyD, i.e., of three CDEs with \u03b1-, \u03b2-, or \u03b3-CyD, PAMAM dendrimers (generation 2, G2) functionalized with \u03b1-CyD (\u03b1-CDE (G2)) showed luciferase gene expression approximately Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1208/s12248-014-9665-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. 100 times higher than for the unfunctionalized dendrimer or for non-covalent mixtures of the dendrimer and \u03b1-CyD, probably due to the high endosomal escaping ability through the cooperative effect of a proton sponge effect of dendrimer and the inclusion ability of \u03b1-CyD with phospholipids in endosomes (20) . Of various \u03b1-CDEs, \u03b1-CDE (G3) with the average degree of substitution (DS) of 2.4 was revealed to have the highest transfection efficiency in vitro and in vivo with low cytotoxicity (20, 21) . In addition, we recently reported that the lactosylated \u03b1-CDE (G3) (Lac-\u03b1-CDE (G3)) has the potential to be a hepatocyte-specific siRNA carrier through asialoglycoprotein receptor-mediated endocytosis (22) . Previously, we designed mannosylated \u03b1-CDE (Man-\u03b1-CDE (G2)) as an APC-selective DNA vaccine carrier (23) . Man-\u03b1-CDE (G2) provided high transfection efficiency, compared with \u03b1-CDE (G2), even in the presence of serum. However, Man-\u03b1-CDE (G2) did not show enough MRmediated internalization to APC, probably due to (1) a short distance of the spacer which linked mannose to the dendrimer of Man-\u03b1-CDE (G2) and (2) poor flexibility of spacer composed of phenylisothiocyanate. Therefore, in the present study, to solve those problems, we newly designed thioalkylated mannose-modified \u03b1-CDE (Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3), Fig. 1 ), having not only longer spacer but also higher flexibility compared with the Man-\u03b1-CDE system, and evaluated the in vitro RNAi effect of the siRNA complex with Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3). The mechanisms by which Man-S\u03b1-CDE (G3) enhanced the RNAi effects were investigated in the view of cellular association, cytotoxicity, the binding to mannose lectins, and physicochemical properties of the siRNA complexes.",

To confirm the complex formation of Man-S-\u03b1-CDEs (G3) with siRNA, we performed an agarose electrophoretic analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 , the bands derived from siRNA in both \u03b1-CDE (G3, DS2) and Man-S-\u03b1-CDEs (G3) systems were charge ratio-dependent and became thin, and it completely disappeared at higher than charge ratios of 5 and 10-20, respectively. At lower charge ratios, the bands derived from siRNA were observed, because a net charge was negative. As the charge ratio increased, the fraction of free siRNA to carriers decreased due to the complex formation with cationic carriers, and then the band disappeared, when siRNA completely formed complexes with cationic carriers (no free siRNA), because the net charge was shifted from negative to positive. These results suggest that the electrostatic interaction of Man-S-\u03b1-CDEs (G3) with siRNA is weaker than the \u03b1-CDE (G3, DS2) complex, and it decreases with the increase of the DSM value. Next, we determined the particle sizes and \u03b6-potential values of the carriers/siRNA complexes (Table I) . The mean particle diameter of the \u03b1-CDE (G3, DS2)/siRNA complex was approximately 240 nm; on the other hand, that of the Man-S-\u03b1-CDEs (G3)/siRNA complexes showed approximately 130-340 nm at a charge ratio of 50, which was the optimal charge ratio in the in vitro transfection study. The mean particle diameter of \u03b1-CDE (G3, DS2)/ siRNA complex significantly increased as the DSM value increased.

In addition, TRITC-Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4) also localized in cytoplasm after transfection with siRNA complex in NR8383 cells (Electronic supplementary material Fig. 3) . Importantly, we revealed that TRITC-labeled Man-S\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4) did not localize in endolysosomes (Fig. 8b) , indicating endosomal escape of Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4) after transfection with siRNA complex in NR8383cells.

            "text": "Recently, Sahay et al. reported that the particles in size of tens of micrometers to several hundred nanometers are internalized by phagocytosis (33, 34) . The mean particle diameters of \u03b1-CDE (G3, DS2)/siRNA and Man-S-\u03b1-CDEs (G3, DSM4, 12, 16)/siRNA complexes were approximately 230 and 130-320 nm, respectively, at a charge ratio of 50 (Table I) . Therefore, Man-S-\u03b1-CDEs (G3, DSM4, 12, 16)/ siRNA complexes possessed preferable particle diameters to be phagocytosed. In addition, the results of polydispersity index indicated that the width of particle size distribution in Man-S-\u03b1-CDEs (G3, DSM4, 12, 16)/siRNA complexes was smaller than that in \u03b1-CDE (G3)/siRNA complex, suggesting that the mannose residues of Man-S-\u03b1-CDEs (G3, DSM4, 12, 16) may inhibit the aggregation of the complex, at least in part, due to their steric hindrance and hydrophilicity. However, the detailed structures of the submicron particles of Man-S-\u03b1-CDEs/siRNA complexes are still unknown. Hereafter, further evaluation of their structures using Charge ratio (carrier/siRNA) * \u2020 * \u2020 * \u2020 * \u2020 Fig. 9 . Cytotoxicity of siRNA complexes with various carriers in NR8383 cells. Cells were incubated with carriers/siRNA complexes for 24 h. The concentration of siRNA was 100 nM. Cell viability was assayed by the WST-1 method. Each point represents the mean\u00b1 SEM of three to four experiments. *p<0.05, compared with PEI/ siRNA complex transmission electron microscope, atomic force microscope, and molecular dynamics simulation will be necessary. Also, the \u03b6-potential value of Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4)/siRNA complex showed a weak positive charge at a charge ratio of 50. The positive charge of the carrier/siRNA complex often causes non-specific adsorption with the serum proteins such as albumin, fibronectin, immunoglobulin, and complement factors and leads to shortening of the half-life in blood as well as decreasing of the RNAi effect in target cells through a nonspecific endocytosis of the carrier/siRNA complex. Collectively, \u03b6-potential of Man-S-\u03b1-CDEs (G3)/siRNA complexes may be involved in the potent RNAi effect and target cell-selectivity advantageously.",

            "text": "The spacer between target ligands and carriers is known to play an important role in recognition by the receptors of target cells (12) . In our previous report, Man-\u03b1-CDEs (G2, G3) were not recognized by mannose-binding lectin (23), meanwhile Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4) showed MRmediated cellular uptake (Fig. 7) . The reasons for this were contributed to (1) the length of spacer and (2) the mobility of the mannose molecules in carriers. It is reported that, of the eight C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs) in MR, CTLD4 and CTLD5 locate in the depth and strongly interact with mannose (35) . Actually, Galustian et al. reported that the mannose recognition ability of DC-SIGN, one of mannosebinding lectins, was enhanced as the spacer becomes long (36) . From the analysis using ChemDraw software, the length of spacer in Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4) having thioalkyl groups was approximately 9.5 \u00c5 and was longer than that in Man-\u03b1-CDE (G3) having phenylisothiocyanate groups (approximately 7.4 \u00c5), suggesting that the recognition ability of Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4) to MR is likely to be improved through not only an increase of the length of spacer, but also a decrease of the steric hindrance by \u03b1-CyD. In addition, based on the chemical structure of spacers, the mobility of mannose residues in Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4) having thioalkyl groups was superior to that in Man-\u03b1-CDEs (G2, G3) having phenylisothiocyanate groups in the recognition of mannose-binding lectin.",

Taken together, these results suggest that Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4) has the potential for a novel APC-selective siRNA carrier. For further experiments, in vivo treatment efficacy of the siRNA targeted for NF-\u03baB p65 (sip65) in lipopolysaccharide-induced fulminant hepatitis caused by MR-expressing Kupffer cells is undergoing after intravenous injection of Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4)/ sip65 complex.",
