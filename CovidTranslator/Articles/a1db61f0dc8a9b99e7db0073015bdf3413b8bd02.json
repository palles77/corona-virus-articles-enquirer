Using these primers, the genome RNA from twelve strains of the various serotypes were reverse-transcribed to cDNA and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). With all strains, 400 base DNA was amplified, indicating that there were no apparent insertions or deletions in this region. However, the amplified DNA showed different cleavage patterns by the restriction enzymes. These 12 strains were classified into 5 groups. The strain typing based on a comparison of the cleavage patterns was consistent with the previous serological typing. This study thus provides a simple and rapid method for typing of IBV.",

Natural outbreaks of IBV are controlled through the use of a vaccine. However, infectious bronchitis (IB) occurs occasionally even among vaccinated flocks. Various strains which have been isolated from these flocks are serologically unrelated to previous strains [14, 19, 23] . Appearances of antigenic variant of IBV thus cause a major problem in poultry industry.",

The present study indicated that the 1-97 and A-5968 strains are relatively close to each other, and thus belong to group III. The 1-609 strain, being distinct from the other two strains, was classified as group IV. The C-78 strain is prevalent in Japan (Y. Kudou, unpubl, data) and is serologically unrelated with previously isolated strains (Y. Kudou, unpubl, data). Attenuated C-78 is currently used as a vaccine strain in Japan. The RFLP data showed that both C-78 and K-79 belong to group V, which is far from other groups. These data were consistent with the serological classification ( Table 1) .",

The distances and branch lengths of this tree indicate the evolutionary relationships among the test strains. It showed the origin of new variant IBV strains causing outbreaks of infectious bronchitis.The ON strain was shown to derive from the Gray type virus. The C-78 and K-79 strains, isolated in 1978 and 1979 respectively, are neither serologically nor genetically related to any other strains, but were shown to derive from a common origin. The PCR-RFLP method thus provides a very useful system for surveying IBV strains in the field and to estimate the origin of an outbreak strain.",

Firstly, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody was found to bind to S 1 glycopolypeptide [29] . Secondly, the urea-released $1 gtycopolypeptide was found capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies [-10] . Therefore, the epitopes of strain-specific neutralizing antibodies were thought to locate on $t glycopotypeptide [12] . It was unclear why the RFLP results in the N terminal region of $2 glycopolypeptide were Probably, genetic mutation in the $2 region occurred at the same rate as that in the region involved in the serotypespecific neutralizing antibody epitopes, probably on the S1 glycopolypeptide. The mechanisms behind the high rate of new variant strain generation in IBV are yet unknown. Although it may be explained by a misreading of viral RNA polymerase in the replication [3, 26] , no other coronavirus was reported to have such a high frequency of new variant appearance as seen in IBV. Another mechanism may therefore exist in addition to the reading error of the RNA polymerase.",

A reaction volume of 50 gl was obtained by the addition of distilled water. After heating at 90 \u00b0C for 5 rain, 30 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Seikagaku Kogyo Co. Japan) were added to the reaction mixture. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, a half volume (25 gl) of alkaline solution (150 mM NaOH, 40 mM EDTA) was added and incubated at 65 \u00b0C for 1 h. After neutralization with 25 gl of 1 N HC1, 25 lal of 1 M Tris-HC1 (pH 8.0) was added to the reaction mixture. Then, cDNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl-alcohol (50:48:2), ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in 10 ~tl of distilled water (cDNA solution).",
