Methods: Based on the relative toxicities of different inorganic metals and inorganic nonmetallic compounds against murine and chicken eF cells, mechanistic estimations were performed based on transcriptomic analyses. Results: lead (ii) acetate induced preferential injuries in the chicken eF and mechanistic analyses using transcriptome revealed that chemokine receptor-associated events are potently involved in metal-induced adverse actions. as an early sentinel of metal exposure, the precision-cut intestine slices (PCiS) induced the expression of chemokines including CXCli1 or CXCli2, which were potent gut-derived factors that activate chemokine receptors in reproductive organs after circulation. Conclusion: eF-selective metals can be estimated to trigger the chemokine circuit in the gut-reproductive axis of chickens. This in vitro methodology using PCiS-eF culture could be used as a promising alternate platform for the reproductive immunotoxicological assessment.",

Some heavy metals that are widely distributed in aqueous and soil environments, such as inorganic arsenic (ias), are potent human carcinogens. The gastrointestinal tract is the first line of exposure to metals in food and drinking water. lead potently suppresses feed efficiency and growth performance in chickens via downregulation of major nutrient transporter genes during oxidative stress responses in the small intestine 4 . Moreover, barrier injuries such as epithelial cell death or leakage as a result of junctional disruption allow more exposure to luminal hazardous xenobiotics, including metals, in the intestine and subsequent translocation to other target organs [5] [6] [7] [8] . in particular, adverse impacts of non-essential heavy metals including lead on reproductive organs have been extensively addressed in mammals and fish 9, 10 . in addition to the toxic effects of lead on gametes and suppressed spermatocyte production, ovarian development is retarded, resulting in a decreased number of oviposited eggs, increased interspawn periods, and suppressed embryo development [10] [11] [12] . Moreover, egg production is decreased in hens receiving lead in feed from the day of hatch and after they have reached sexual maturity 13 .",

Therefore, eFs are often used as feeders of embryonic stem cells. Moreover, induced pluripotency in chicken eF can generate germ cells and facilitate their optimal survival and migration to embryonic gonads via the chemokine receptor-linked pathway 19, 20 . in addition to impacts on egg development, eF can play key roles in the innate immunological recognition and tissue repair following infection and inflammatory insults to the reproductive organs [21] [22] [23] . in the present study, eFs were used to compare the relative toxicities of inorganic heavy metals, which are known to contaminate mammalian and avian diets as well as drinking water. Changes in gene profiles in chicken embryonic fibroblasts exposed to metals was potently associated with early gastrointestinal exposure. The approach described herein will provide new insight into alternative models for estimation of coupling adverse events between early exposure and target organ toxicity using the in vitro transcriptome-based platform.",

Cellular gene expression was assessed in DF-1 cells after exposure to iC20 doses of lead or arsenite for 24 h. after integrating both lead-and arsenite-induced gene expression profiles, functional categorization was evaluated in DF-1 cells. among the various type of gene-linked functions, the category of chemokine-chemokine receptor interaction showed the highest value of probability of involvement (Figure 2a ). in particular, analysis of the gene revealed that the CC subfamily or CXC subfamily genes were involved in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway through the Kegg pathway ( Figure 2B ). CXCr1, CX3Cr1, and CCr6 were up regulated by the chicken eF-toxic metals. along with induced CXCr1, coupling ligands such as CXCl6 were also elevated by the metals. Moreover, geometric distribution analysis of the integrated gene profile indicated that oviduct-located genes are most frequently altered by treatment with lead and arsenite, followed by spleen-and brain-associated genes ( Figure 2C ). Based on a cutoff of a 2-fold increase, nineteen genes were commonly upregulated by both lead and arsenite treatment in DF-1 cells ( Figure 2D ). Taken together, analyses of gene profiles revealed that chemokine receptor-associated events are potently involved in metal-induced adverse actions in reproductive organs, including the ovary, embryo and oviduct.",

The impact of lead on gut tissues was assessed using precision-cut intestine slices (PCiS) since the tissue culture model may simulate the relatively intact tissue contexture in response to luminal xenobiotics. Chicken PCiS produced a highly reproducible and regular morphology of chicken intestine ( Figure 3a) ; therefore, it represents a mini gut model that was well suited for studying luminal exposure in toxicological research because it contains all of the cells of the gut, including mucosal immune cells, while maintaining intracellular and cell-matrix interactions 24 . Chicken PCiS-based chemokine gene expression was assessed based on the assumption that luminal xenobiotics may trigger chemokine release from the early exposure site (gut). as a positive xenobiotic agent, the effects of Fusarium-producing deoxynivalenol (Don) were also evaluated because this fungal toxin is a representative gut barrier disruptor capable of strong pro-inflammatory insult that is found in feed and foodstuff worldwide 25, 26 . in the chicken small intestine, lead induced production of chemokine CXCli1 or CXCli2 in a time-dependent manner, and this occurred only slightly later than the induction by Don ( Figure 3B ). When compared with the chemokine induction in the small intestine, lead and Don had more influential effects on CXCli2 than CXCli2 ( Figure 3C ). The induction of CXCli2 (corresponding to human interleukin 8, CXCl8) was initiated early and maintained for 12 h in the large intestine following exposure to lead or Don. in response to chemokine induction in the exposure site (gut), Don also enhanced CXCr1 as the receptor for CXCli1/2 in chicken eF cells ( Figure 3D ). gastrointestinal exposure to metals, including lead, causes reproductive disorders such as reduced egg production and infertility. The organ-to-organ interaction was mechanistically estimated by the culture-based gene analysis. Therefore, the present culture-based estimation of the chemokine-chemokine receptor circuit during xenobiotic exposure provides a potent alternate platform for assessment of the effects of exposure and target events in chickens.",

For this migratory behavior of germ cells and guidance in the oviduct, chemokines and their receptor-linked messengers must regulate and facilitate the process of reproduction. Chemotactic molecules guide directional migration toward gonadal somatic cells, whereas chemorepellent-expressing somatic cells forcibly repel migrating germ cells or indirectly induce disruption of chemoattractant signals in the surrounding somatic cells. Chicken germ cells passively migrate from the central to the anterior region, then actively move toward the germinal crescent 32 . in the second migratory phase, chicken germs cells were shown to penetrate developing blood vessels and circulate until they finally settled into the genital ridges 33 . in particular, g-protein-coupled chemokine receptors (CXCr4 and CXCr6) were found to facilitate germ cell migration 34 .

Mechanistically, metal-disrupted chemokine homeostasis would be detrimental to embryonic programming via (i) activation of the inflammatory cell stress response, which alters optimal gene profiling with lasting impacts on developmental trajectory, (ii) epigenetic modification-induced permanent changes in phenotypes and (iii) inflammation-induced cytotoxicity (apoptosis, necrosis, and pyroptosis) and loss of tissue components. even small perturbations in blastomere number and inner cell mass/trophectoderm allocation in the blastocyst could influence later growth trajectory of the fetus and offspring 39 . lead-induced chemokine and chemokine receptor pathways would account for disorganization of the wound healing processes in reproductive organs [40] [41] [42] . in terms of risk assessment, PCiS-based monitoring provides an easy methodology for screening of gut-derived factors in the chicken exposure model. PCiS is a culture system for differentiated intestinal epithelial lin-ings surrounded by submucosa, muscularis, and serosa that is similar to the gut luminal exposure system. originally, PCiS was used for physiological measurements of the mucosal barrier similar to an Ussing chamber. PCiS has also been used to evaluate drug metabolism and transport in mammalian systems [43] [44] [45] . in terms of the mucosal immune system, this chicken PCiS system can be used as an alternate avian infection model since it includes the intestinal lymphoid tissues for defense 46 . in the present study, both the chicken small intestine and colon were sliced to assess early events following gastrointestinal exposure to metals and Don under the assumption that these xenobiotics frequently contaminate the diet and drinking water. This monitoring using PCiS can support alternate immunotoxicological assessments for detection of early gut-derived factors, which can account for chemokine-linked immunological or developmental distress in reproductive organs ( Figure 4B ).",

Moreover, as a readout of early exposure, gut-derived chemokines including CXCli1 or CXCli2 were induced in the intoxicated gut using PCiS. Metal-induced gut chemokines are promising triggers of target-specific disorders in the reproductive organs via interactions with the chemokine receptors. This in vitro methodology using a PCiS-eF-based tiered platform in the gut-to-oviduct/embryo axis could be incorporated as a new simplified alternate platform of animal reproductive immunotoxicological assessment.
