Although, the virus closely resembles with the prototype vesiculovirus, Vesicular Stomatitis Virus, it could be readily distinguished by its ability to infect humans. Studies on Chandipura virus while shed light into distinct stages of viral infection; it may also allow us to identify potential drug targets for antiviral therapy. In this review, we have summarized our current understanding of Chandipura virus life cycle at the molecular detail with particular interest in viral RNA metabolisms, namely transcription, replication and packaging of viral RNA into nucleocapsid structure. Contemporary research on otherwise extensively studied family member Vesicular Stomatitis Virus has also been addressed to present a more comprehensive picture of vesiculovirus life cycle. Finally, we reveal examples of protein economy in Chandipura virus life-cycle whereby each viral protein has evolved complexity to perform multiple tasks.",

An outbreak of severe febrile encephalitis in Malaysia with reports of human deaths in 1998-99 was associated with Nipah virus (Chua et al. 2000) . Coronavirus associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) posed a threat of epidemic in 2003 with rapid spread across the eastern Asia (Marra 2003) . In another recent outbreak, a deadly strain of avian flu virus H5N1 spread across the parts of three different continents from 2004 to 2006 through poultry trading as well as migratory birds (Ducatez et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2005 ).

Therefore, further investigations are required to obtain evidences that supports the principles forwarded by Koch's postulates to unequivocally establish CHPV as an emerging human pathogen (Nature Reviews Microbilogy editorial 2006; Van Ranst 2004) . Nonetheless, isolation of CHPV from sand flies earlier in 1967 (Dhanda et al. 1970 ) and also during the recent epidemic (Rao et al. 2004) lead to suspect sand fly as a potential vector for this viral pathogen.",

Viruses belonging to this family owe its name rhabdo, meaning rod-shaped in Greek, to the typical bullet shaped morphology and include human pathogens such as CHPV (Fig. 1a) or rabies.

            "text": "Vesiculovirus life cycle can be divided into discrete steps, namely, adsorption of virus particle, penetration of virus into cell, uncoating and release of core RNP into the cytosol from late endosomal vesicles, transcription of the genome by viral polymerase, translation of viral mRNA, post-translational modifications of viral proteins, replication of viral genome, assembly of progeny particles and finally budding of mature virion. Entire vesiculovirus life cycle within infected cell is cytosolic (Banerjee 1987a) . Genome RNA enwrapped with Nuleocapsid protein N acts as a template for sequential transcription starting from 3\u00a2end of the genome to synthesize short leader RNA and five monocistronic capped and poly adenylated viral mRNAs. Viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is composed of Large protein L, the catalytic subunit and phosphorylated form of Phosphoprotein P that acts as a transcriptional activator. Translation of viral mRNAs results in accumulation of viral polypeptides within infected cells and set up stage for the onset of genome replication (Banerjee 1987a; Barr et al. 2002) . During replication, the same polymerase switches to replicative mode to copy entire genomic template into an exact polycistronic complement that acts as replication intermediate to produce many more copies of (-) ve sense genomes upon further rounds of replication. Progeny (-) ve sense genomes are also subjected to transcription, referred to as secondary transcription. Notably, virus specific genomic analogues, and not mRNAs, always remain encapsidated by N, while, it is believed that progressive encapsidation of nascent genome RNA during its synthesis is necessary for replication and/or protecting replication product from cellular RNases (Banerjee 1987a;  a P N b Fig. 1 (a) A schematic presentation of bullet shaped Chandipura virus with glycoprotein G protruding out of the viral envelope. (b) A proposed view of Chandipura virus genome RNA encapsidated with Nucleocapsid protein. Nucleocapsid protein binds to viral RNA to enclose it in a disc like structure. This disc like structures stacks on each other to generate a helical assembly, as depicted, to form core nucleocapsid. Phosphoprotein P and Large Protein L remain associated with N-RNA Barr et al. 2002) . Below, we will discuss individual components of Chandipura virus and their role in viral life cycle.",

            "text": "Ming Luo and his colleagues have recently reported that bacterial co-expression of N and P protein resulted in a complex with 10 molecules of N, 5 molecules of P and \u00e3 90 nt long RNA of bacterial origin. A low salt treatment readily dissociated P to obtain a decamer N complex associated with RNA. Electron micrograph of decamer N revealed a disk-like appearance (Green et al. 2000) with disk size simlar to one turn of helix in viral nucleocapsid particle (Thomas et al. 1985) . Single particle electron microscopy revealed that RNA molecule is closely associated with inner surface near the top end of such highly symmetrical disc (Chen et al. 2004 ). Accordingly, it was proposed that this disc-like particle assembles into a helical structure by stacking on each other to form viral nucleocapsid (Fig. 1b) . Finally, crystal structure of these N discs associated with RNA was solved to reveal that the RNA is tightly bound in a cavity at the interface between two lobes of the N protomer, with nine nucleotides of RNA associated with each N polypeptide. RNA binding cavity within N molecule was considerably positively charged. Residues that are involved in direct association with phosphates of RNA are spread across the N protein. Out of six residues that contact phosphates, four are conserved among different rhabdoviruses, implying a similar mode of RNA binding. Tyr 21, which apparently stacks against nucleotide 1 of the bound RNA, is substituted in CHPV-N by phenylalanine, another aromatic amino acid. An extensive network of interactions between neighboring N molecules was also revealed with each N monomer contact with three other N monomers. A hinge region between two lobes of N protomer was proposed to provide necessary flexibility such that RNP can adopt alternative conformations at different stages of maturation.",

How could viral polymerase possibly read sequences during transcription while genome RNA is enwrapped by N? Based on chemical probing experiments it was suggested that bases are available on the surface of the nucleocapsid for polymerase recognition (Iseni et al. 2000) . However, crystal structure of the nucleocapsid-like particles revealed that out of 9 nt associated with each N monomer, bases in position 5, 7 and 8 are completely shielded by N thus conceivably prevented from forming RNA duplex during transcription ). Therefore, it was postulated that viral RNA is temporarily dissociated from N protein within the active polymerase complex during transcription, a possibility also suggested by Banerjee (1987a, b) . Reports of similar structure for rabies virus nucleoprotein-RNA complex (Albertini et al. 2006 ) and identification of disc-like appearances for CHPV-N (Majumdar et al. 2004 ) allowed us to built up a conceptual framework towards understanding conserved pathways for rhabdoviral nucleocapsid assembly (discussed later). Nonetheless, nucleocapsids are subjected to further state transitions, presumably involving M protein, from an undulating ribbon to tightly coiled helix before packaging within mature virus (Thomas et al. 1985) .",

CHPV-N gene codes for a 422 amino acid polypeptide with no reports for any significant post-translational modifications. Comparison of rhabdovirus and paramyxovirus N proteins revealed a region with significant identity at the center of the polypeptide (Masters and Banerjee 1987 ) that has been implicated for N-N association (Banerjee 1987a) . Recent crystallographic data on VSV-N protein indicated that this central region forms constituents of both N-and C-terminal lobe and thus probably instrumental in maintaining overall architecture of the protein Fig. 2 A Schematic depiction of specific yet processive encapsidation of Chandipura virus genome RNA by Nucleocapsid protein N. The picture describes self-assembly of N protein monomer into oligomer that binds to leader RNA or unrelated RNA. Dissociating detergents such as deoxycholate disrupts those oligomer into monomer units and also prevents further oligomerisation. Phosphoprotein P associates with N to keep N protein in a monomer form. This monomer N is able to recognize specific sequence present on leader chain in the nucleation step (I) and is recruited to the viral RNA with concomitant release of P. Subsequently, additional N molecules associates with RNA bound N monomers in the elongation phase (II). N polymerization mediates a conformational change, thus, generates broad specificity within RNA binding interface of N protein and allows for progressive encapsidation to enclose RNA into a helical conformation. This model posit important role of N polymerization on its RNA binding specificity and encapsidation. A proposed stem-loop structural element within leader sequence has also been depicted",

Native viral protein obtained after dissociating from RNA (Blumberg et al. 1984) or recombinant protein obtained by over-expressing within eukaryotic cellular milieu (Sprague et al. 1983 ) forms aggregates.

Transmission electron microscopy of homogenously purified CHPV-N removed from detergent revealed similar disc-like appearances (Majumdar et al. 2004 ) as obtained for VSV N-P complex. Subsequent studies revealed a role for osmolytes in preventing further aggregation of this oligomer N (Majumder et al. 2001) . P was identified as a N specific chaperone that prevented N aggregation in vitro and in vivo independent of its phosphorylation status (Majumdar et al. 2004) . One important difference between N preparations described for CHPV and those reported by Green et al. was the absence of detectable amount of bacterial RNA in CHPV-N (Majumdar et al. 2004; Bhattacharya et al. 2006) . Rather, purified CHPV-N was shown to interact with RNA of viral or nonviral origin in vitro (Majumdar et al. 2004; Bhattacharya et al. 2006; Majumder et al. 2001) , substantiating the conclusion that N preparation was not saturated for RNA binding. Considering a high degree of sequence homology, these apparent contradictions were striking and may arise from high salt purification protocol used to obtain CHPV-N, which could potentially dissociate bound RNA (Bhattacharya et al. 2006; Majumder et al. 2001 ). However, it seems possible that N rapidly polymerizes as soon as it is synthesized thus were unable to enclose RNA into the disc like structures, when expressed alone in bacteria (Bhattacharya et al. 2006; Majumdar et al. 2004 ). Whereas, co-expressed P prevented such self-assembly and allows for defined polymerization of N protein on RNA chain. Based on their study in VSV, Green et al. (2000) predicted a transient yet indispensable role for P in appropriate assembly of N into a nucleocapsidlike particles, whereas, absence of P would result in an aggregated N that is incapable of RNA binding. Therefore, studies on CHPV suggest existence of additional possible mechanisms for rhabdoviral N protein assembly in a P independent manner (Majumdar et al. 2004) .",

How does N maintain a dual status, i.e. its ability to recognize specific sequence on nascent RNA (nucleation) and still progressively encapsidate RNA of diverse sequences (elongation)? While, VSV-N crystal structure provided insight into the molecular interactions present within mature nucleocapsid, recent studies on CHPV-N described a dynamic model for Nmediated nulcleocapsid assembly (Bhattacharya et al. 2006) . In their experiment, Bhattacharya et al. used a dissociating detergent deoxycholate to disrupt oligomeric disc structure of bacterially expressed N protein to obtain monomer N. Furthermore, they removed the detergent from N preparation in presence of Phosphoprotein to reveal that P prevents re-assembly of N into oligomer and maintain it in a monomer form, in vitro. Subsequently, they compared RNA binding specificities of monomer N and its oligomeric counterpart. These course of studies strikingly revealed that monomer N could recognize specific sequence present within the first 21 nucleotides of (+) leader RNA whereas oligomer N shows a compromised RNA binding specificity. Finally, viral minigenome length RNA sequestered N from its P bound monomer form to initiate appropriate encapsidation into a nuclease resistant structures.",

In the nucleation step, monomer N that poses an intrinsic RNA binding specificity recognizes viral sequences on nascent leader RNA to initiate nucleocapsid assembly. Subsequent N-N association during elongation phase results in subtle conformational change to allow for compromised binding specificity so that newly polymerized N on RNA molecule can bind to heterogenous sequences. While, a fast reversible interaction between N and P protein ensures supply of additional N monomers, N-N as well as N-RNA association, traps N from N-P complex within encapsidation complex during elongation.

Previous studies with VSV-defective interfering (DI) particle revealed that the 5\u00a2terminal 36 nucleotides and 3\u00a2terminal 51 nucleotides of the genome are sufficient for replication, encapsidation and budding (Pattnaik et al. 1995) . In vitro assembly assay with synthetic nucleocapsid identified the first 19 nt from the 5\u00a2end of the (+) sense RNA as necessary component for encapsidation (Moyer et al. 1991) . Moreover, a heterologous sequence when fused downstream to the first 19 nt sequence from viral RNA, supported encapsidation, thus confirming a compromised specificity in the ensuing encapsidation process (Moyer et al. 1991) . Also, a large network of N-N interactions was shown to stabilize nucleocapsid assembly, therefore, consistent to the need for association between N proteins in enduring encapsidation. N protein expressed in bacteria or in mammalian cell in absence of P assembles into aggregate Majumdar et al. 2004 ). This oligomeric N was shown to form RNase resistant complexes with leader RNA ), but was unable to encapsidate longer VSV RNA in vitro (Moyer et al. 1991) . Oligomeric N of CHPV once formed was only able to loosely associate with RNA instead of forming true encapsidation complex (Bhattacharya et al. 2006) . Finally, complex formation with P was proposed to suppress non-specific RNA binding ability of N, therefore, channel N protein towards viral specific sequences within infected cells (Masters and Banerjee 1988a ). Our current model, consistent to this observation, proposes that N protein maintained in monomer form through its association with P would exhibit such RNA binding specificity.",

VSV expression system allowed N to form 2:1 complex with P and therefore it appears that stoichiometry of N-P complex plays a critical role in RNA binding specificity. Such suboptimal level of P would result in a trimeric assembly with two N molecules and one P protein, while, N-N association within those complexes may allow for non-specific RNA binding. However, N-P complex with one monomer from each protein provides RNA recognition specificity of N.

Proposed conformation alterations due to N-N association also need to be investigated. As N protein lacks any well-characterized RNA binding motifs; most striking aspect of this proposal is an intrinsic RNA binding specificity that is hardwired within N molecule. If true, this may allow for development of small molecule inhibitors of nucleation as potential antiviral agents. Further mutagenic analysis on N protein to dissect oligomerisation, P binding and RNA binding will shed light on Chandipura virus nucleocapsid assembly pathways.

Except for G/L junction, the gene junctions are highly conserved between CHPV and VSVind serotype indicating that a general mechanism is employed by vesiculoviruses to regulate gene-expression. While, for VSVind, G/L junction still has a dinucleotide in the intergenic space, VSVnj or CHPV contains 20 and 21 nucleotide in between G and L transcription units, respectively (Marriott 2005) . However, direct investigations to identify cis-acting signals required for CHPV gene-expression has been impeded due to lack of reverse genetics system. Recently, a minigenome-based replicon of Chandipura virus was constructed and efforts are currently underway to reveal sequence codes for transcriptional initiation and termination (A.

Determination of relative molar ratios of different viral mRNAs within infected cells revealed that their abundance decreased with increasing distance from the 3\u00a2 promoter in an order N>P>M>G>L, thus implying a mechanism that also ensures polar transcription (Villarreal et al. 1976, Iverson and .

In this model, subsequent to single site entry at the beginning of leader gene, viral polymerase sequentially transcribes the genome with progressive attenuation at each gene boundary to result in decreasing amount of transcripts for genes that are distant from the entry site. Each termination event may lead to the polymerase to fall off from the template or may allow for re-initiation at the downstream promoter. Therefore, transcription from downstream genes is dependent on termination of upstream genes and reinitiation. This proposal explained observed polarity during transcription, while, anti-termination by polymerase at the gene boundaries results in synthesis of replication product (Banerjee a, b,) . Consistent to single site entry model, VSV polymerase was able to predominantly produce ppAC dinucleotide representing 5\u00a2 dinucleotide of the leader RNA in an incomplete in vitro transcription reaction that was supplemented with only ATP and CTP and not ppAACA tetranucleotide that represents beginning of a mRNA, (Emerson 1982 ).",

While, this model lacks supports of experiments done on wild type virus, it was also unable to explain experimentally observed polar transcription in vesiculoviruses.

            "text": "A unique feature of VSV mRNA synthesis is involvement of L protein in 5'end modification of the nascent mRNA that includes methylation and capping. However, unlike cellular guanylyltransferase, L protein incorporates GDP rather than GMP in the capped structure as Gp(alpha)p(beta)-p(alpha)A. The 5\u00a2end modification events were proposed to be successive to transcription initiation, whereby, nascent mRNA termini maintains contact with transcribing polymerase until modified (Stillman and Whitt 1999) . Notably, leader RNA lacks 5\u00a2 cap structure. This may have resulted from the lack of a consensus trinucleotide sequence at the 5\u00a2end of leader RNA that is otherwise present in the other mRNA species; or may reflect requirement for a minimum transcript length for capping. Addition of poly(A) tail to the viral mRNA is also attributed to the L protein, where, polymerase slippage during transcription termination at U7 tract is believed to add A residues at the 3\u00a2end of mRNA (Barr et al. 1997) . A protein kinase activity was also found to be associated with the purified VSV-L that has been termed as L associated kinase, LAK. It is still not clear, if the protein kinase activity is intrinsic to the L polypeptide or reflects a co-purified cellular kinase (Banerjee 1987a, b) . Nevertheless, L protein remains associated with translation elongation factor, EF1; while, EF1-bc complex was proposed to constitute LAK activity, EF1-a may participate in the capping by virtue of GTP/GDP binding activity (Das et al. 1998 ). Therefore, it seems likely that L protein in conjunction with Phosphoprotein P and other cellular components, synthesize viral mRNA within infected cells and offers for mechanisms that could be potential drug targets, such as its unique capping or RNA dependent RNA polymerase activity. Nevertheless, a recombinant expression system to study structure and function of CHPV-L is yet not available and is required for additional analyses.",

            "text": "Successful in vitro reconstitution of Chandipura virus transcription with purified components by Chattopadhyay et al. (1997) was an important step towards developing mechanistic insight into transcription. To this end, RNP particle obtained from detergent disrupted virus was treated with high salt buffer to dissociate N-RNA from L and P. Subsequently, N-RNA collected on the glycerol cushion or released L and P protein collected from the top of the gradient was further purified following rigorous biochemical protocol. When, purified L protein was incubated with N-RNA in a reaction mixture that allows for in vitro transcription, it was unable to synthesize viral mRNA. However, addition of viral P protein along with L, and not P alone, allowed for viral mRNA synthesis. These studies confirmed a role of Phosphoprotein as an activator of viral transcription (Chattopadhyay et al. 1997 ) and this proposed function was consistent to the observations made in VSV (Banerjee 1987b) . Chattopadhyay and Chattopadhyay (1994) cloned Phosphoprotein gene of CHPV to express in bacteria and used purified recombinant protein to understand importance of post-translational modifications of P. P, a 32.5 kDa protein when analyzed on SDS-PAGE shows anomalous migration with apparent molecular weight of 50 kDa. Studies with recombinant P protein critically showed that negatively charged N-terminal domain was responsible for such anomalous migration. However, when viral P was substituted with its bacterially expressed counterpart, it failed to support transcription from N-RNA template, implying requirement for additional modifications for P protein function (Chattopadhyay et al. 1997) . P of both VSVind and VSVnj serotypes was extensively phosphorylated within infected cells at multiple sites (Hsu and Kingsbury 1982; Banerjee 1987a; Clinton et al. 1979 ). Accordingly, a role for host derived kinases was proposed in modifying P at specific residues (Barik and Banerjee 1992a; Clinton et al. 1982) . Casein Kinase II (CKII) was shown to be responsible for phosphorylating P of both VSV serotypes (Banerjee 1987b; Barik and Banerjee 1992a) . Studies with recombinant CHPV-P revealed CKII, indeed similarly phosphorylates P in vitro (Chattopadhyay and Chattopadhyay 1994) , although, CHPV-P exhibited less than 20% homology with P protein from other vesiculoviruses (Masters and Banerjee 1987) . Further investigations identified serine-62 at the N-terminal acidic domain of CHPV P protein was specifically modified by CKII (Chattopadhyay et al. 1997) . Only CKII phosphorylated form of recombinant P could effectively substitute P protein purified from virus to support transcription from nucleocapsid template in vitro (Chattopadhyay et al. 1997) . A mutated version of P protein with alanine substituted for serine 62 , when tested in vivo was unable to activate transcription and rather inhibited viral mRNA synthesis in a trans-dominant manner . Therefore, CKII mediated phosphorylation appeared to be indispensable for P to act as a transcriptional activator. The C-terminal domain of P was proposed to associate with N-RNA template during transcription, thus tethers polymerase with its template and provide processivity during transcription (Gao and Lenard 1995) .",

This sequential phosphorylation event was proposed to modulate transcriptional activation property of VSV-P ( Barik and Banerjee 1992a, b; Banerjee 1987b; Chattopadhyay and Banerjee 1987) . Mutational analysis identified serine 62 in CHPV-P as single phophorylation site in vivo to suggest existence of only P0 and P1 forms ).

Phosphorylated P forms dimer (Chattopadhyay et al. 1997 ) and N-terminal 46 amino acids were proposed to be responsible for phosphorylation-mediated dimerisation (Raha et al. 2000) . Accordingly, a critical role for phosphorylation mediated dimerisation was proposed that regulate P protein function in transcription via efficient polymerase interaction (Gao and Lenard 1995) . However, large zone gelfiltration technique was employed to reveal gradual appearance of dimer and tetramer species within unphosphorylated P protein pool in a concentration dependent manner. This observation was further substantiated by measuring sedimentation coefficient of those different oligomer species using analytical ultracentrifugation technique and measuring hydrated diameter by dynamic light scattering ). Furthermore, Ding et al. (2006) has recently reported crystal structure for dimerisation domain of VSVind P protein, first of its kind for any vesiculovirus P. Intriguingly, such analysis indicated that a central domain, spanning 107-177 residues, mediate dimer assembly of the P protein in its unphosphorylated form. This central domain is composed of a a-helix surrounded by two b-hairpins. While, a-helix forms dimer, two b-hairpins from each P protein engages into domain swapping to form four stranded b-sheet and provides stabilizing force. In light of Chandipura research, it seems possible that N-terminal domain of P may provide additional stabilizing interactions by exposing coiled-coil motif upon phosphorylation (Raha et al. 1999 (Raha et al. , 2000 , although, such domain is probably not required for dimerisation per se. Whereas, central domain assembles P into a dimer even in its unphosphorylated form. Therefore, dimerisation alone was not sufficient to explain transcription activation property of phosphorylated P.",

Indeed, a complex from VSV-infected cells composed of L, P and N protein was isolated that showed replication activity, in vitro (Gupta et al. 2003 ). Phophorylation of P was shown to be dispensable for the activity of this proposed tripartite replicase complex, thus, separating it from the classical L-P1 transcriptase complex. Accordingly, it was postulated that the integration of de novo synthesized N protein into a replicase complex resulted in differential promoter recognition by polymerase to initiate replication phase. Although, such model could not satisfactorily explain generation of leader RNA during viral RNA synthesis . In this proposal, abortive replication attempts by polymerase resulted in accumulation of leader RNA within cells. However, in vitro transcription with Chandipura virus nucleocapsid resulted in synthesis of leader RNA . Even as replication byproduct, presence of discrete leader RNA species within virus-infected cells implies a strong attenuation signal for polymerase at the leader-N boundary, that needs to be suppressed for productive replication. Also this model was proposed based on studies on an engineered version of VSV that can substantially differ from wild type virus in nucleocapsid conformation, thus, may allow for observed internal entry of the polymerase.",

One possible explanation was provided in studies with Influenza virus, where a direct interaction between RNA bound N proteins and polymerase was proposed (Biswas et al. 1998 ). In VSV, encapsidation was proposed to oppose polymerase pausing at the geneboundaries to bring about anti-termination. However, clear biochemical evidence for such proposal is still missing (Banerjee 1987a) . Chandipura virus, when allowed to multiply within cells with a preformed pool of N-P1 complex, showed negligible enhancement in replication, implying existence for additional mechanism in catalyzing transcription-replication switch (unpublished observation). Also, a stoichiometric amount of N is required to encapsidate viral RNA to protect it from RNase action and stabilize the single stranded genome within nucleocapsid core. Therefore, it could be questioned if N is actually required for the onset of genome replication (catalyzing replication) or its role is confined in protecting replication product from degradation (stoichiometric role). It seems possible that a major role for N in providing protection to progeny genome RNA may have resulted in an over-estimation of its function in the onset of replication.",

On the other hand, C-terminal basic residues of VSV P protein was shown to be required for transcription and not for replication .

            "text": "However, Basak et al. subsequently presented another intriguing observation that connected a role for P0 in viral replication with events on nascent leader RNA chain. In their study, CHPV-P protein was shown to specifically bind with leader RNA in its unphosphorylated form, whereas, CKII mediated phosphorylation abrogated its RNA binding ability . Leader RNA-P0 interaction was distinct from N-mediated encapsidation of viral RNA. Moreover, oligomeric status of P0 was shown to partly alter its RNA binding pocket thus fine-tunes P0 assembly on leader chain ). Accordingly, a new model was proposed to explain Chandipura virus genome replication . In this proposal, recruitment to nascent leader chain allows P0 to interact with transcribing polymerase in the vicinity and alters polymerase conformation in a manner that enables read-through at the geneboundaries (Fig. 3) . Consistently, structural differences between activation domains of P0 and P1 was reported in CHPV (Raha et al. 1999) . Theoretical analysis of prokaryotic transcription also revealed that a transcriptional activator may acts as a repressor by mediating differential contact with polymerase (Roy et al. 1998) . Therefore, this model predicts that such differential contact may enable anti-termination by mammalian virus RNA polymerase during transcription. Nonetheless, progressive encapsidation of nascent RNA by N maintains processivity of replicase complex to allow for synthesis of~11.1 kb (+)ve sense genome. Progeny (+)ve sense genome, however, lacks transcription termination elements, thus, exclusively acts as template for replication to synthesize more copies of (-)ve sense genome RNA. M2-1 phosphoprotein of human respiratory syncytial virus, a paramyxovirus, was shown to bind leader RNA whereby binding affinity was reduced upon phosphorylation (Cuesta et al. 2000) . Similar phosphoregulation of RNA binding of P protein was also reported for Rinderpest virus, another paramyxovirus, to postulate a conserved function of leader RNA-P0 interaction in mononegavirus life-cycle (Raha et al. 2004a) . Notably, the proposed mechanism for Chandipura virus to read-through its gene-boundaries during replication bears remarkable similarity to the N mediated anti-termination strategy employed by bacteriophage k (Rees et al. 1996; Oppenheim et al. 2005) . It also constitutes an example of protein economy, whereby; a single protein in two different forms has been used in two distinct steps of viral RNA synthesis. Chandipura virus P protein posses a consensus CKII site enclosing serine-62 (-Ser-Glu-Glu-Asp-), as discussed earlier. CKII, being a ubiquitous kinase raises a question of possible existence of unphosphorylated P protein within virus infected cells. However, Basak et al. has recently postulated a phosphatase activity that is induced upon Chandipura virus infection within BHK-21 cells and capable of dephosphorylating P protein . Induction of this phosphatase activity remarkably coincides with the onset of genome replication. Curiously, recent studies identified a conserved Glu64Asp mutation within P protein in all epidemic isolates . In light of proposed function of unphosphorylated P protein in boosting up viral replication, functional consequences of such mutations in viral life-cycle need to be tested.",

Reverse genetic tools need to be employed along with biochemical experiments for further characterizing CHPV pathogenesis at molecular details. While retaining general academic interest for mechanism of RNA synthesis in rhabdoviruses, future Chandipura research should also focus on development of potential anti-viral therapeutic interventions that allows for specific inhibition of viral growth without any pleotropic effect on cellular metabolism.

Matrix protein M, beside its role in viral assembly, is also used for interfering with host cellular metabolism. Nucleocapsid protein N has multiple targets whereby it interacts with both P protein and viral RNA to form precise nucleocapsid template. Phosphoprotein P in its distinct phosphorylated state can act as either transcriptional activator or an anti-terminator. We propose that fragility of single stranded RNA molecule and replicative advantage of compact genome due to shorter replication cycle imparts constrain on Chandipura virus genome length.
