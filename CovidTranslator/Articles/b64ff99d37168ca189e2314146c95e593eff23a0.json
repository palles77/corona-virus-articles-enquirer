Serological assays for MERS-CoV have also been developed, but they are not widely available and have not been fully validated; case confirmation has relied predominantly on molecular detection methods.",

Invitations principally targeted one responsible laboratory in each country; for three countries, two laboratories were included as they were both tasked with MERS-CoV testing. Survey responses were not verified for accuracy. Table 1 . The survey was completed by 19 laboratories in 16 countries of the Western Pacific Region. The majority of participating laboratories (15/19) were National Influenza Centres (NICs) or located within an institution housing an NIC, highlighting the role of the pre-existing GISRS network in MERS-CoV testing.",

All countries indicated that they had national-level laboratories with the necessary materials for MERS-CoV testing on-site or employed international referral. It is important to continue strengthening the apparatus for MERS-CoV detection in the Region, in particular ensuring testing proficiency by EQA participation, and enhancing referral mechanisms and IATA certification where needed. National-level capacity is a key asset provided that it is well connected with the public health system at the subnational level. In-country referral capacity must therefore also be in place. WHO and its partners will continue to provide technical support to countries to address these issues. In conclusion, while there proved to be sufficient time to build laboratory capacity for the detection of MERS-CoV before its entry into the Western Pacific Region, we may not be so fortunate for future emerging infectious diseases. Thus, maintaining and further strengthening the public health laboratory system is a critical undertaking.",
