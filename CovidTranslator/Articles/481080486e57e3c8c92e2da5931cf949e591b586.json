A second was to focus on the nucleic acid genome as the primary criterion for classification. Viral genomes take a variety of forms: DNA or RNA, double stranded or single stranded, segmented or not, plus (\u00fe) or minus (\u00c0) polarity, circular or linear. The smallest genomes have a few thousand nucleotides (kb) containing genes for a structural protein and a few essential enzymes. Other larger viruses have genomes of more than 200 kb that include complex regulatory elements. The overall taxonomic system identified four characteristics to be used in the classification of all viruses: nature of the nucleic acid in the virion; symmetry of the capsid; presence or absence of an outer lipid envelope; dimensions of the virion and capsid.",

Species designations are not capitalised or italicised. The following represents an example of the full formal taxonomic terminology: order -Mononegavirales; family -Paramyxoviridae; sub-family -Paramyxovirinae; genus -Respirovirus; species -parainfluenza virus type 3. Comparative sequencing data identifies genotypes or clades. The many criteria used to group viruses into this hierarchical classification system may be found on the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) website. 1 Summary Following the boom in respiratory virology in the 1960s, species of rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, parainfluenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were added to influenza and measles viruses as causes of respiratory tract infection. In restricted patient groups, such as the immunocompromised, members of the family of herpesviruses including herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus and human herpes virus 6 have also been associated with respiratory disease. This list of pathogens was extended last year with the discovery of a novel virus, the human metapneumovirus. More than 200 antigenically distinct viruses have been documented as causes of sporadic or epidemic respiratory infections in infants, children and adults. However, this varied and diverse group can be divided among six distinct families. Understanding some of the basic biology of these families gives an insight into possible strategies for diagnosis, control and therapy. \u00df 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of part of the G gene followed by restriction enzyme digestion analysis is a rapid technique that has been used by Cane et al. to screen samples to obtain an estimate of the genomic variability within an epidemic. 5 Each epidemic was found to be made up of a number of different genotypes and could be considered as an aggregate of separate concurrent epidemics. Genotypes circulating in the UK are very similar to those found in other parts of the world. 6 There is evidence that certain genotypes are more pathogenic than others. 7 The genetic maps of the PIVs have some similarity to that of RSV encoding N, P, M, F and L proteins that have distantly related functional counterparts to the same proteins in RSV. However, the human PIVs lack NS1, NS2, SH and M2 proteins, and the PIV P gene gives rise to additional accessory proteins.

Pre-determined changes in the nucleotide sequence can be introduced into infectious virus by way of the cDNA intermediate. 9 By using this technology, it may also be possible to create a chimeric vaccine strain that has genes, for example, for several different paramyxovirus F proteins.",

Major antigenic shift is not seen in influenza B or C because these viruses only infect humans. The antigenic differences of the HA and NA glycoproteins provide the basis of the classification of influenza sub-types. The practical importance of this classification is that no cross-immunity is conferred between different sub-types and the antigenic differences are vital for monitoring epidemics across the world and in vaccine production. Currently, a total of 15 distinct HAs have been recognised among the influenza A viruses. 13 Antigenic differences also occur in the NA antigen of which nine sub-types have been identified among humans and avian species. It is technically possible to refer to a laboratory influenza isolate as either A or B, followed by the place of isolation, the laboratory number, and the year of isolation; followed by the sub-type designation in parentheses.

Intranasally administered, live attenuated vaccines may be more acceptable for children and provide longer lasting immunity. Studies are currently underway to assess the additional benefit of these vaccines over inactivated vaccine in high-risk populations. Two approved anti-viral drugs, known as neuraminidase inhibitors, are available for treatment and prevention of both influenza type A and B infections in older children and adults. 16, 17 Zanamivir is given by inhalation and oseltamivir is given orally. Controversy surrounds the use of these drugs because clinically significant side-effects are not tolerable in the treatment of mild self-limiting infections, and treatment should be initiated within 24-36 h of initial symptomatology. The rational use of neuraminidase inhibitors depends to a large extent on the availability of rapid diagnostic tests. 18 Point-of-care testing (near-patient testing) is available in kit-form utilising enzyme-immunoassay-based technology. Tests are performed at room temperature with no specialist equipment by non-laboratory personnel. These assays will detect virus antigen in 15-30 min but with a sensitivity and specificity range from 60 to 95% and 52 to 99%, respectively. RT-PCR is the most sensitive diagnostic test allowing the use of minimally invasive specimens. However, these tests take hours to complete in their current format and are not likely to play a role in the decision to initiate anti-viral therapy or to institute control of infection procedures.",

This polyprotein is cleaved in a highly specific manner by proteases to produce both structural molecules and proteins involved in viral replication. The non-enveloped capsid consists of a densely packed icosahedral arrangement of protomers, each consisting of four polypeptides; VP1, 2, 3 and 4, all derived from cleavage of the original protomer VP0.The viral particle is small (hence pico-RNA), 27-30 nm in diameter, while the length of the genome is $2500 nm and consequently tightly packed into the capsid. 19 The human rhinoviruses include more than 100 serotypes in two main groups based on their cellular receptors. Over 90% of rhinovirus serotypes use the intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) as the cell receptor for attachment. Approximately 10% of the serotypes attach by the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. A review of rhinoviruses is found in the article by Savolainen in this issue.",

A review of EVassociated respiratory illness found that 45% of cases presented with upper respiratory tract infections, 13% with respiratory distress, 13% with pneumonia and 12% with otitis media; others presented with bronchiolitis, croup and sore throat. 20 Initially, EVs were allocated four species on the basis of their pathogenesis in humans and in experimental animals; poliovirus (PV), coxsackievirus A and B (CVA and CVB) and echovirus (E). Through the use of serotype specific sera, enteroviruses were further classified into 64 serotypes (e.g. PV1-3; CV A1-24; CV B1-6; E1-33). Biological and sequence analysis has indicated that two picornaviruses, echovirus 22 and 23, have a number of important features that distinguish them from all other picornaviruses. They have highly divergent sequences and show major differences in capsid proteins. On this evidence, E-22 and E-23 were classified in a new genus, Parechovirus, where they were designated human parechovirus 1 and 2, respectively.",

Ishiko et al. have developed a rapid and reliable method based on RT-PCR and sequencing of the VP4 region to place clinical isolates into one of the five species. 21 EVs, like other RNA viruses, have a high mutation rate because of the lack of proofreading activity during genome replication. It is estimated that approximately one mutation is generated per newly synthesised genome and that EVs have a mutation rate 1 million times higher than that of the human genome. Ishiko et al. state that this higher mutation rate is advantageous for phylogeny-based classification because it enables detailed molecular epidemiological studies even using a short region of the genome (207 base pairs of complete VP4).",

In a double blind, placebo-controlled trial, 180 patients aged 14-65 years received either 200 mg of pleconaril three times per day, or placebo. Those receiving pleconaril had a 2-day shorter duration of headache and a 2-day faster resolution of all symptoms of aseptic meningitis. 22 The question remains as to whether the benefits of such a drug are worthy of widespread use. 18 However, the control of picornavirus infections is most likely to be achieved by the anti-viral approach rather than by vaccination. X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed very precise three-dimensional structures of the picornavirus capsid and the way they interact with cell receptors. On the basis of such studies, drugs such as pleconaril have been designed to block viral attachment to host cells; other similar drugs will follow.",

The viral particles are comparatively small (80 nm) non-enveloped icosahedrons, which are stable to low pH, bile and proteolytic enzymes. The molecular biology of these viruses is understood in great detail. Unlike the RNA respiratory viruses that have been discussed so far, viral DNA replication proceeds with a much higher level of fidelity. Viral DNA polymerases possess an intrinsic exonuclease, which preferentially excises mismatched nucleotides from duplex DNAs. Recent experiments have shown that mutations that impair the exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase greatly increase the rate of mutation of the viral genome. 27 The classification of human adenoviruses is now based on nucleotide sequence differences between genomes from distinct viruses. These viruses also display a characteristic G-C content in their DNA which has been exploited by using the enzyme SmaI that cleaves specifically at 5 0 CCC GGG. By running the digested DNA on agarose slab gels, it is possible to obtain patterns unique to each of six species (Table 3) . This technique provides an efficient means of identification and classification of unknown strains. Other methods to differentiate the six species include G-C%, haemagglutination patterns, oncogenicity and serotype. 28 Adenovirus infections have, for many years, been successfully controlled among young military recruits in the USA, using live enteric-coated oral vaccines against serotypes 4 and 7. Their use was associated with a 50-60% reduction in overall respiratory illness and a 95-99% reduction in adenovirus-specific illness rates in recruits. 29 The use of this or similar vaccines among the paediatric population has not been investigated.
