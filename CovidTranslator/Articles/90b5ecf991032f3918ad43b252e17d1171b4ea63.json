For example, influenza viruses survive longer on surfaces or in droplets in cold and dry air -increasing the likelihood of subsequent transmission. Thus, it is key to understand the effects of environmental factors on the ongoing outbreak to support decision-making pertaining to disease control.

Our proxy for R, designated as R proxy , is a constant that maps cases occurring from time (t) to time (t + d) onto cases reported from time (t + d) to time (t + 2d); where d is an approximation of the serial interval (i.e., the number of days between successive cases in a chain of disease transmission).

Our measure is considered only a proxy for R because it does not use details of the (so far poorly defined) serial interval distribution, but instead, simply calculates the multiplicative increase in the number of incident cases over approximately one serial interval. Such proxies are at least approximately monotonically related to the true reproductive number and cross 1 when the true reproductive number crosses 1 (8) . After computing these proxy values over a variety of subsequent moving time windows, a mean value was obtained and utilized as our estimated reproductive number R for each province. To minimize potential inclusion of imported cases in our analysis, R estimates were calculated after the closure of Wuhan on January 23rd, 2020.",

Our estimates of the observed R proxy across locations were calculated using available and likely incomplete reported case count data, with date of reporting, rather than date of onset, which adds noise to the estimation. In addition, the relatively short time length of the current outbreak, combined with imperfect daily reporting practices, make our results vulnerable to changes as more data becomes available. We have assumed that travel limitations and other containment interventions have been implemented consistently across provinces and have had similar impacts (thus population mixing and contact rates are assumed to be comparable), and have ignored the fact that different places may have different reporting practices. Further improvements could incorporate data augmentation techniques that may be able to produce historical time series with likely estimates of case counts based on onset of disease rather than reporting dates. This, along with more detailed estimates of the serial interval distribution, could yield more realistic estimates of R. Finally, further experimental work needs to be conducted to better understand the mechanisms of transmission of the COVID-19. Mechanistic understanding of transmission could lead to a coherent justification of our findings.",
