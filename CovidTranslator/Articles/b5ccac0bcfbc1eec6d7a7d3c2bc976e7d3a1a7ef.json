At least equally daunting is the need to be familiar with the evergrowing list of specific ocular syndromes, the correct identification of which has huge significance in terms of therapy and prognosis. There are many examples in which a perfectly adequate description and general morphologic diagnosis will nonetheless fail to communicate the appropriate prognostic or therapeutic information, simply because the clinician reading the report cannot make the connection between the histologic description and the specific clinical syndrome as outlined in clinical reference texts.",

Even with a globe obtained within minutes of death or surgical removal, improper handling of the specimen frequently results in a section of poor quality. The globe can be speedily and gently removed by grasping the third eyelid with forceps and applying traction to the globe while making a circumferential incision at the fornix. Blunt curved scissors inserted through this incision may be used to sever the extraocular muscles and optic nerve, and allow the globe to be removed from the orbit. All orbital fat and extraocular muscles should be gently removed from the sclera to permit rapid penetration of fixative to the retina.",

Formalin has the advantage of ready availability, ease of shipment, little danger of overfixation, and adequate preservation of color and macroscopic detail for photography. Also, it permits localization in the bisected globe of lesions identified ophthalmoscopically, and the use of electron microscopy should such examination be warranted by the findings of light microscopy. However, formalin penetrates the sclera slowly, and there are postmortem changes, including retinal detachment, even in globes fixed immediately after death or surgery. Injection of formalin into the vitreous (0.25 mL for a dog or cat, 2.0 mL for a horse) greatly improves retinal fixation and helps prevent the almost inevitable retinal detachment that follows routine formalin fixation. Rapid-penetrating fixatives, such as Zenker's, Davidson's, or Bouin's, are preferred for globes in which preservation of histologic detail, especially retinal detail, is paramount. All render the globe and its refractive media opaque and less suitable for macroscopic assessment and photography than does formalin, but they also make the globe more rigid and therefore much easier to trim in preparation for histologic processing. All require strict attention to the duration of fixation.",

Anomalies are usually multiple, which reflects the stepwise induction and interdependence of the various parts of the developing eye. Without proper consideration of ocular embryology, any discussion of the lesions found in anomalous eyes threatens to be just a catalog of observations rather than a roadmap to understanding that such lesions are all predictable results of a relatively small number of errors in organogenesis. It is also important to recognize the differences in normal ocular structure among the various species, and the different rates at which mature form is attained. For example, the retina of carnivore eyes continues to develop for ~6 weeks postnatally, whereas that of ruminants and horses is mature at birth. Thus a condition such as retinal dysplasia is necessarily an in utero event in ungulates, but may be in response to early postnatal injury in carnivores. In the globes of carnivores, the terms congenital and developmental are therefore not synonymous.",

Surrounding the optic cup is a mass of mesenchyme, derived from neural crest, which will form the vascular and fibrous tunics of the eye (iris and ciliary body stroma, corneal stroma and endothelium, choroid and sclera) under the induction of the differentiating neuroectoderm (Fig. 5-2) .

Virtually all globes with primary microphthalmos have multiple ocular anomalies, including anterior segment dysgenesis, persistent embryonic vasculature, and cataract, and not just \"miniaturization.\" Most examples of clinically diagnosed sporadic microphthalmos are probably not primary developmental anomalies, but responses by the fetal or neonatal globe to traumatic or other injuries that result in a cessation of development or even regression.

Proper maturation of the RPE and in particular, the normal acquisition of pigmentation, appears to be critical to the induction of normal mesenchymal migration and maturation. Failure by the developing RPE to induce proper mesenchymal maturation results in such varied anomalies as choroidal hypoplasia, segmental or diffuse iris, and ciliary hypoplasia (known clinically as iris coloboma), and even microphthalmia.

Failure of closure of the fissure may occur anywhere along its length, but the channel persists most frequently as a notch-like defect of the caudal pole at, or just ventral to, the optic disc. Its exact location can vary substantially. Such defects are known as colobomas (\"congenital missing parts\"). When they occur as the result of a failure of closure of the most posterior portion of the optic fissure, they are known as \"typical\" colobomas, and are lined by an outpouching of dysplastic neuroectoderm. If the defect is sufficiently large, the outpouching of neuroectoderm induces a similar bulge in the sclera, termed scleral ectasia . Occasionally, such ectasias are so large as to form a retrobulbar cyst as large as the globe itself (Fig. 5-7) . Regardless of size, the lining of the scleral coloboma is formed by neuroectoderm that bulged through the defect in the optic cup. Abortive neurosensory differentiation within the cyst wall is common and permits definitive identification of the retrobulbar cyst as being a coloboma. Segmental defects in the development of uvea or sclera occurring in sites other than the optic fissure are known as \"atypical\" colobomas and have a separate pathogenesis related to improper induction of uveal and scleral maturation by defective neuroectoderm (Fig. 5-8A, B) .",

At the anterior edge of the optic cup, one or more waves of mesenchymal invasion form corneal endothelium, corneal stroma, and the anterior half of the transient perilenticular vascular network, including the pupillary membrane. The posterior half of this perilenticular vascular tunic is formed by invasion of mesodermal endothelial cell precursors and supporting perivascular mesenchyme through the optic fissure to form the extensive but transient hyaloid artery system (see Fig. 5 -2). Another mesenchymal wave accompanies the ingrowth of the neuroectoderm at the anterior lip of the optic cup to form the iris stroma, although it is unclear which layer acts as the primary inducer. Its peripheral portion later atrophies to form the porous filtration angle of the anterior chamber, a process that may not be completed in carnivores until 6-8 weeks after birth. The choroid and sclera are induced by the developing RPE to form from the mesenchyme surrounding the caudal half of the optic cup. Anomalies of mesenchyme may result from defective ingrowth or differentiation, as with choroidal and iris hypoplasia, incomplete atrophy of the tunica vasculosa lentis or hyaloid artery system, or incomplete remodeling of the filtration angle to cause primary glaucoma.",

Much more commonly, the error in remodeling is less profound, and the lesion is seen as a continuous sheet of iris stroma (therefore resembling an abnormally solid pectinate ligament) that separates the anterior chamber from a relatively normal trabecular meshwork. This more common lesion is usually referred to as pectinate dysplasia . For a more complete discussion, see Glaucoma.",

Of these, the one most frequently reported (perhaps just because it is the most spectacular and significant) is persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. In people, this rare anomaly is typically unilateral and is accompanied by microphthalmos, microphakia, retinal detachment, shallow anterior chamber, and embryonic filtration angles. The many reports of this anomaly in dogs have described a unilateral or bilateral retrolental vascular or fibrovascular network, usually without any other reported anomalies other than the expected posterior polar cataract. Such lesions are better described as persistent posterior tunica vasculosa lentis. In Doberman Pinschers, Bouviers, and Staffordshire Bull Terriers, the classification as hyperplastic primary vitreous is more credible. In these breeds, the defect is inherited and forms a spectrum that includes persistent pupillary membrane, cataract, lenticonus, and microphthalmos as well as persistence of variable amounts of primary vitreous and posterior tunica vasculosa lentis . The defects are detected as early as gestational day 30, at which time hyperplasia of posterior tunica vasculosa lentis is already obvious.

It is an important structure clinically because it is the origin for most of the inflammation, pigmentation, scarring, and vascularization that characterize most severe corneal diseases. The limbus is not a precise line but a region characterized by transition from conjunctival to corneal epithelium, and by transition from the disorganized and vascularized connective tissue of the sclera to the nonvascular and highly regimented stroma of the cornea.

However, the efficacy of cyclosporine, which acts primarily by suppression of T-helper cells, in reversing canine lacrimal adenitis provides evidence for such a pathogenesis.

Biopsy is rarely warranted, but when taken during the acute disease may show epithelial changes ranging from erosion to hyperplasia to squamous metaplasia, with eosinophils around dilated subepithelial blood vessels and percolating throughout the epithelium. Eosinophils are much more likely to be identified in cats than in dogs, a species difference that is also true of allergic skin disease in general.

It has 3 histologic layers; physiologically, there is a fourth and most superficial layer of precorneal tear film, but that is not visible histologically. The most superficial layer is 10-15 layers of stratified squamous nonkeratinized epithelium sitting on a thin basal lamina. That epithelium has limited regenerative capacity, forms a hydrophobic barrier via tight junctions between the horizontal cell membranes, and is anchored to the underlying stroma by hemidesmosomes with anchoring fibrils that penetrate through the basal lamina and into the superficial stroma. That epithelium has a turnover time of approximately 2 weeks, and the germinal basal cells are continuously replenished by centripetal migration of cells from the permanent replicative population that resides in the bulbar conjunctiva at the limbus. The middle layer, and always the thickest layer, is the corneal stroma. It resembles modified sclera, with the collagen fibers being particularly thin and regular, stretching the entire diameter of the cornea without interruption and lying parallel to the corneal surface. The stromal fibrocytes, known as keratocytes, are inconspicuous. There are no blood vessels, and there are no visible leukocytes within the normal corneal stroma.

Without this understanding, corneal disease simply becomes a list to be memorized and diagnosed only if the lesions match pictures and descriptions already contained in various textbooks. This is not fruitful because the range of diseases is seemingly infinite, and the lesions hardly ever match perfectly with published photographs! Fortunately, there are only 3 fundamental concepts required to truly understand 95% of all corneal diseases. 1. The cornea begins its embryologic life as skin, and seems to harbor a secret desire lifelong to return to being skin! It is able to survive postnatally as an avascular, cell-poor, transparent cornea only because it is afforded a moist and massive deposition of hyalinized fibrin and a diffuse scattering of mononuclear leukocytes. The defect is seen in dogs with congenital (and probably inherited) plasminogen deficiency, resulting in the excessive persistence of fibrin that is presumably being generated as part of almost any type of inflammatory disease. The specificity of the diagnosis does not reside in the character of the inflammation, but in the abnormal persistence of the fibrin once it is generated. Only one report included postmortem evaluation of other tissues, and there were similar fibrin deposits below other mucous membranes, as well as in epicardium and endocardium. Conjunctival lesions can be successfully treated with topical plasminogen. Feline lipogranulomatous conjunctivitis is probably the feline counterpart of canine chalazion. The lesion occurs almost exclusively in the lamina propria of the palpebral conjunctiva adjacent to the margin of either the upper or lower eyelid. The histology is very repeatable, consisting of a nodular accumulation of clear lipid lakes intermingled with large foamy macrophages and a few small or mononuclear leukocytes . Although the original report contained no mention of adjacent Meibomian lobules, the similarity between this entity and canine chalazion is impossible to ignore (see Fig. 5 -22B). ",

Dugan S, et al. Clinical The cornea exists in a privileged environmental niche, bathed in the nurturing and antimicrobial saline of the tear film and protected from other irritation by the movable eyelids. Within this protected niche, the cornea does therefore not require the protective attributes of skin (keratinization, leukocytes, blood vessels) to protect itself from the harsh external environment. If there is rapid deterioration in any component of this protective environment, the cornea is most likely to respond with ulceration and subsequent wound healing. If, on the other hand, the shift is of gradual onset, then the more likely response is adaptive metaplasia in which the cornea reaches into its embryologic cutaneous heritage and becomes skin-like.",

If the epithelial or endothelial defect is focal, the resultant edema is limited to the stroma adjacent to the defect. The edematous cornea is clinically opaque, and may be up to 5 times its normal thickness. At least experimentally, edema subsequent to endothelial damage tends to be more severe than edema secondary to epithelial injury. Edematous stroma stains less intensely than normal, and collagen lamellae are separated into a fine feltwork of pale-staining fibrils by excessive hydration of the glycosaminoglycan ground substance (principally keratan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate). These sulfated glycosaminoglycans have different water-binding capacities, and differences in glycosaminoglycan distribution within different layers of the corneal stroma may explain why corneal edema is sometimes more obvious at one level of the stroma than others (Fig. 5-25B ).

Because the cornea has no resident blood vessels or leukocytes, it cannot undergo true inflammation, and so there is no such thing as primary \"keratitis.\" Almost all lesions interpreted clinically as keratitis are actually the result of corneal injury and repair. Only in the event of cutaneous metaplasia, with the acquisition of blood vessels, can the cornea undergo true inflammation. Virtually every globe submitted by a veterinary practitioner for histologic assessment will have some type of corneal injury, varying from acute ulceration to more chronic manifestations of post-ulcerative wound healing.

Shallow defects in the superficial stroma may become filled by a thickened plaque of epithelial cells that create an epithelial facet. Deeper defects that include more than the outer third of stroma will usually require rebuilding of the damaged stroma before epithelial sliding and regeneration can occur, but this is not invariable. The quality of the stroma seems to be more important than the quantity of stroma when it comes to determining whether wound healing will occur just by epithelial sliding, or whether the stroma itself must be rebuilt as a prelude to successful epithelial healing. Even very deep corneal ulcers sometimes heal almost exclusively with epithelial sliding and subsequent replication, with no apparent effort to rebuild the stroma . What determines the exact pattern of wound healing is probably the mixture of cytokine growth factors produced in response to corneal injury. The list of growth factors and their origins seems almost endless, and the confusion is perpetuated by our inability to accurately transfer in vitro experimental information into an in vivo clinical situation.

Viable stromal cells (keratocytes) adjacent to the wound undergo fibroblastic cannot claim that the initial depth alone is the deciding factor, because even very deep wounds will sometimes heal just with epithelial sliding and eventual mitotic rebuilding, as long as the epithelium is satisfied with the quality of the underlying stroma. The sliding begins within a few hours, initially from wing cells from the immediately adjacent, viable cornea. Migration by basal cells rapidly follows. The sliding is preceded by lysis of the hemidesmosomes. Adhesion of the sliding epithelium is initially to adhesion molecules such as fibronectin and laminin deposited along the exposed stromal surface. Reformation of the hemidesmosomes and their anchoring filaments may take weeks or even months, during which time epithelial adhesion remains precarious. Healing of shallow, uninfected corneal ulcers by sliding epithelium is rapid, 1 mm per day; restoration of the basal lamina and hemidesmosomes may take up to ~6 weeks.",

Such cells, when recruited for corneal wound healing, may retain a conjunctival phenotype that includes pigmentation and a tendency to form rete ridges. The exact chemical signaling that determines whether the migrating epithelium retains a conjunctival phenotype or becomes truly corneal is not known, but epithelium that is migrating into an environment of persistent desiccation or superficial irritation will typically remain \"conjunctival,\" and is often referred to as cutaneous metaplasia (see . The regenerating epithelium always seems to produce its own new basement membrane even if pre-existing basement membrane still seems available, so thickening of the basement membrane is one of the histologic clues by which we identify recurrent ulceration. If the injurious stimulus disappears, the conjunctival character of the epithelium slowly fades, being replaced within 4-6 weeks by a normal corneal epithelial configuration. Epithelial adhesion to the underlying stroma remains fragile for 6-8 weeks until the hemidesmosomal attachments of epithelium to basal lamina and stroma can rebuild. In the interim, the cells adhere to a mixture of fibrin and fibronectin derived from the inflamed conjunctival vessels via the tear film or from the injured cornea itself. In many cases, the only evidence of previous shallow ulceration is a sepsis). This influences the exact intermingling of all the chemical and cellular ingredients involved in this wound healing. Large gaping wounds commonly fill with a mixture of prolapsed iris and fibrin that will usually resolve into permanent iridocorneal adhesions known as anterior synechiae ( Fig. 5-28A ). The migrating corneal epithelium will commonly use the iris as a \"substitute stroma,\" growing across its surface to seal the corneal defect while leaving the iris permanently incorporated into the corneal stroma ( Fig. 5-28B ). Perforating injuries that disrupt Descemet's membrane and corneal endothelium stimulate repair of that endothelium as described previously, but in many cases, there is also a plaque of fibrous tissue that forms in the deep stroma and in the anterior chamber adjacent to that injury. The fibroblasts, most of which are probably derived from stromal keratocytes but which may also evolve via endothelial fibroblastic metaplasia, tend to grow along the posterior surface of Descemet's membrane to form what is known as a retrocorneal fibrous membrane. Eventually, the corneal endothelium may regain continuity on the posterior surface of this membrane, secrete a new Descemet's membrane, and result in a cornea with 2 separate Descemet's membranes separated by persistence of this retrocorneal fibrous membrane. metaplasia and secrete large amounts of sulfated ground substance, particularly chondroitin sulfate. Most of the new stroma is produced by fibroblasts recruited from the limbus. Their ingrowth is always accompanied by a similar ingrowth of new blood vessels ( Fig. 5-27C ). This ingrowth begins ~4 days after substantial corneal injury, and migrates from the limbus centrally at a maximal rate of ~1 mm per day. This 4-day lag time is, presumably, a period of grace in which small or shallow defects can heal with epithelial regeneration alone, without the visual impairment that inevitably follows stromal fibroplasia. Once the epithelium seals the defect, there is immediate cessation of neutrophilic influx and, presumably, a similarly abrupt drop in the production of fibroblastic/ angioplastic stimulatory cytokines. The scarring and vascularization that are the manifestations of stromal rebuilding are permanent, even though the fibrous tissue gradually becomes less cellular, the collagen fibrils reorient to resemble more closely the parallel arrays of normal stroma, and the ground substance gradually reverts from an embryonic configuration dominated by chondroitin sulfate to the normal predominance of keratan sulfate. Complete restitution of normal stroma, however, never occurs, although the residual scar may be subtle and better detected by clinical examination than by histology. Undesirable though such scarring may be, it is certainly better than the alternative of ineffective corneal healing and inevitable corneal rupture.",

The defect appears not to be in epithelial healing per se, because sliding and mitotic activity are normal in affected dogs, and all of the adhesion molecules and growth factors seem to be present. Keratectomy specimens reveal poorly adherent hyperplastic epithelium at the ulcer margins, usually with multiple clefts separating epithelium from stroma even in areas distant from the obvious ulcer. The basal lamina is usually not visible with light microscopy, and the epithelium appears to be attempting to adhere to a thin zone of hypocellular, pale-staining stroma that could correctly be interpreted as a very shallow sequestrum qualitatively similar to what was described previously in cats ( Fig. 5-31A , B). The observation of pyknotic and lytic keratocyte nuclei within this superficial zone suggests that the basic defect is degeneration of the superficial stroma, so that epithelial hemidesmosomes and anchoring collagen fibrils attempting to reform after ulceration have no substrate in which to anchor. Very chronic cases usually acquire superficial stromal granulation tissue appropriate to any chronic ulceration, but its onset is much delayed in comparison to infectious or traumatic ulcers. The fact that epithelial adhesion and wound healing will be successful following the use of any technique that either removes the superficial sequestrum or punches multiple holes through it to allow deeper stromal granulation tissue to reach the wound healing surface strongly supports the notion that the barrier to wound healing lies in the presence of the devitalized stroma itself (Fig. 5-31C ).",

Such lesions more likely reflect an unexplained exaggeration or persistence of the normal superficial stromal degeneration that occurs as a prerequisite for wound healing following superficial corneal ulceration of virtually any pathogenesis. commonly in dogs, however, the desiccation is not absolute (at least initially), and the epithelial response is protective cutaneous metaplasia without prior ulceration. Keratinization, marked hyperplasia with rete ridge formation, and pigmentation are commonly seen. Stromal inflammation and vascularization are usually superficial, resulting in a lesion very similar to pannus keratitis. Squamous metaplasia may also occur in the bulbar conjunctiva. The conjunctivitis that clinically is the earliest lesion of keratoconjunctivitis sicca is rarely available for histologic examination. The lesions following corneal desiccation from any other pathogenesis (in histology specimens, most commonly related to incomplete eyelid closure in dogs with ocular enlargement from glaucoma) resemble those of any other acute superficial ulceration, with the notable exception that the ulceration is not usually accompanied by edema or any substantial neutrophilic infiltration simply because there is no tear film to contribute the fluid or the neutrophils.",

The most common causes are desiccation or trauma, but there are a few very specific bacterial and viral pathogens that seem capable of colonizing and injuring even the normal cornea. Regardless of cause, the loss of epithelium initiates a predictable series of corneal reactions caused by absorption of water and neutrophils from the tear film, local production of inflammatory mediators and cytokines, and opportunistic microbial contamination of the wound. Imbibition of water causes superficial stromal edema below the ulcer and is followed by migration of neutrophils from the tear film and, later, from the limbus. The leukocytes, although somewhat protective against opportunistic pathogens, also add their collagenases, proteases, and stimulatory cytokines to the wound and thereby may inadvertently contribute to its progression. Epithelial and stromal repair proceeds as already described for corneal wound healing, but the repair fails in those cases in which microbial contamination is well established or in which the cause of the initial ulceration has not been corrected. Common examples of the latter are found in dogs in which corneal trauma by misdirected cilia or facial hair, or desiccation resulting from lacrimal gland dysfunction (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), persists.",

Ulcers contaminated by Pseudomonas and Streptococcus spp. are particularly prone to rapid liquefaction because of the potent collagenases and proteases produced by these organisms. Pseudomonas ulcers have been extensively investigated because of the devastating liquefaction of cornea that commonly accompanies this infection. The bacteria themselves produce numerous proteases and other toxins that may be important in the establishment of the early infection, but most of the characteristic stromal malacia results from the action of proteases originating from leukocytes, reactive corneal epithelium, or injured stroma.

Almost all diseases listed in clinical textbooks as examples of keratitis are in fact diseases characterized initially by ulceration or by cutaneous metaplasia, and most of the changes clinically interpreted as inflammation would be better interpreted as essential parts of normal wound healing or adaptive metaplasia.

Eosinophils may be less conspicuous on histologic examination of keratectomy specimens, perhaps because most seem determined to emigrate through the epithelium and into the tear film rather than remain within the tissue. Instead, the stromal lesion is a mixture of macrophages, plasma cells, fibroblasts and, unpredictably, mast cells and at least a few eosinophils. The latter are least frequent in older lesions, either because of time alone or because older lesions are more likely to have received a lot of corticosteroid therapy.

Acquired immunity alters the manifestations of the disease and results in different lesions predominating in different age groups.

For whatever reason, the typical equine eye enucleated for mycotic keratitis has an intense neutrophil-rich deep stromal keratitis with several characteristic features: neutrophils are karyorrhectic, inflammation is most intense immediately adjacent to Descemet's membrane, and frequently there is lysis of the normally resistant Descemet's membrane with spillage of the corneal inflammation into the anterior chamber. Fungi are numerous within the malacia of the deep stroma and within Descemet's membrane itself, but rarely, if ever, are seen within the anterior chamber ( Fig. 5-35A , B). When they occur within the anterior chamber, they are always anchored to the nearby Descemet's membrane.

Moraxella is found within degenerate epithelial cells, but it is not known whether invasion is necessary for subsequent cellular destruction. In field epizootics, the earliest lesion is bulbar conjunctival edema and hyperemia, followed in 24-48 hours by the appearance of a shallow central corneal ulcer. The ulcer is a small (<0.5 cm) focus of epithelial necrosis that may appear as erosion, vesicle, or full-thickness epithelial loss. In untreated animals destined to develop the full clinical expression, the ulcer enlarges, deepens, and frequently attracts enough neutrophils to qualify as a corneal abscess. Stromal liquefaction ensues, probably as a result of neutrophil lysis, which is itself initiated by Moraxella-derived leukotoxins. By the end of the first week, there is extensive stromal edema and vascularization extending from the limbus. As with any severe ulcerative keratitis, the subsequent progression or regression of the lesion varies with each case as modifications by therapy, opportunistic bacterial and fungal contamination, trauma, inflammation, and immunity interact.

Nonpiliated, nonhemolytic strains predominate in healthy cattle and are probably part of the normal conjunctival flora.

The pathogenesis of the cataract has traditionally been ascribed to the excessively high level of glucose within the aqueous. Glucose is normally the major energy source for lens fibers, with most of it used to fuel the Embden-Meyerhof pathway of anaerobic glycolysis. When the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway, hexokinase, is saturated with glucose, the backup of glucose is shunted to alternative metabolic pathways. Chief among these is the sorbitol pathway, activated in the rabbit lens by glucose concentrations of >5 mmol/L (>90 mg/dL). In this pathway, the excess glucose is converted by an aldose reductase to the polyalcohol, sorbitol, which is then slowly reduced to a D-fructose, a ketohexose. Because this second reaction is much slower than the first, sorbitol may accumulate to very high concentrations within the lens and osmotically attracts water even to the point of hydropic cell rupture. Under experimental conditions at least, the early cataract may be reversed if aqueous sugar levels are reduced to normal, but the later cataract is irreversible.",

Sunlight-induced cataract has been described several times in farmed fish, but not yet for other domestic animals as a naturally occurring phenomenon. Absorption of UV or near-UV wavelengths by lens epithelium nucleic acids or lenticular aromatic amino acids results in photochemical generation of free radicals and peroxidative damage to numerous structural components of the lens. A similar pathogenesis probably explains the development of cataract in animals irradiated as part of cancer therapy. In one study, 28% of dogs receiving megavoltage X-radiation for nasal carcinoma developed diffuse cortical cataract within 12 months of irradiation. In people, the risk of cataract is dose related, and reaches virtual certainty with dosages of 800-1,500 centigrays (cGy) or rads, whereas rodents require at least twice that dosage. The dogs in the study cited previously received 3,680-5,000 cGy.

Even after total destruction of the lens fibers, the durable capsule will be found somewhere in the anterior or posterior chamber as a curled eosinophilic mass, often encapsulated in fibrous tissue probably derived from surviving lens epithelium or from injured ciliary epithelium.

Hematogenous ocular mycosis is found almost exclusively in dogs, except for cryptococcosis, which is more common in cats. Blastomyces and Cryptococcus are more likely to invade the eye in the course of generalized infection than are Coccidioides or Histoplasma, and occurrence in nonendemic areas is strongly linked to prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy.

Much more common than this classic retinochoroiditis, however, is lymphocytic-plasmacytic anterior uveitis with serologic evidence of active Toxoplasma infection. The role of toxoplasmosis in feline anterior uveitis is controversial (see Idiopathic lymphonodular uveitis of cats). Retrospective histologic studies list the majority of such cases as idiopathic and are presumed to be immune mediated, with antigen or antigens unknown. In the several large published studies, there has not been a single case confirmed by observation of merozoites or cysts in the eye; even serologic evidence in these studies pointed to toxoplasmosis in only 1-2% of cases. In contrast, one study reported evidence of anterior uveal production of Toxoplasma-specific antibody in 32 of 69 cats with anterior uveitis, and another report confirmed that anterior uveitis is indeed the most frequent manifestation of toxoplasmosis in cats, seen in 60% of cats with confirmed toxoplasmosis. Nonetheless, evidence remains less than conclusive about the role of T. gondii in the prevalent and enigmatic syndrome of anterior uveitis in this species. It may be that the local production of Toxoplasma antibody in cats with uveitis is merely the result of nonspecific recruitment of Toxoplasma-sensitized lymphocytes into the chronically inflamed uvea, and that lymphoid aggregates in such eyes are producing a whole range of antibody quite irrelevant to the original cause of the uveitis.",

During the acute viral stage of the disease, viral replication within endothelium and stromal phagocytes of the uvea results in a primary mild nonsuppurative uveitis that usually is clinically undetected. Inoculation of field virus into the anterior chamber of dogs and foxes may result in viral inclusion bodies within corneal endothelium and subsequent edema, but edema is not a feature of the active stage of naturally occurring disease. During the convalescent phase of the disease, or 6-7 days after vaccination with a modified live virus, a small percentage of dogs develop anterior uveitis, endothelial damage, and corneal edema (\"blue eye\") that is a manifestation of type III hypersensitivity to persistent viral antigen, in which complement fixation attracts neutrophils. The proteases of neutrophils are responsible for the cell injury. The histologic lesion is bilateral but not usually of equal intensity, thus clinically apparent disease may be unilateral. Corneal edema results from diffuse hydropic degeneration of corneal endothelium and secondary stromal edema. In a small percentage of affected dogs, the damage is so persistent as to cause interstitial keratitis and permanent fibrosis. Whether this sequel results from unusually persistent antigen, unusually severe endothelial damage or age-dependent variation in endothelial regenerative ability is unknown. Intranuclear inclusion bodies of adenovirus type may be seen in a few degenerate endothelial cells.

The unilateral granulomatous fundic lesions are caused by a single wandering larva, and are relatively common in children but have rarely been described in nonhuman subjects despite the rather common occurrence of ascarid-induced granulomas in canine kidneys, lungs, or livers. The paucity of reports may not reflect the actual prevalence of disease in specific canine populations. One large survey of working sheepdogs in New Zealand recorded a 39% prevalence of lesions attributed to visceral larva migrans, contrasted to a 6% prevalence in similar dogs living in urban environments. The active lesions were lymphocytic and granulomatous uveitis, nonsuppurative retinitis, and peripapillary nontapetal retinal necrosis. Inactive lesions involved chorioretinal scars and multifocal chronic retinal separations in dogs older than 3 years. Larvae most compatible with T. canis were seen in sections of some acutely affected eyes. The high prevalence in these dogs was tentatively ascribed to the feeding of uncooked frozen mutton that may have contained T. canis larvae as part of a dog-sheep-dog life cycle. A report of similar lesions in Border Collies in the United States was associated with the feeding of raw pork.",

This \"immune deviation\" begins with the continuous presence of immunomodulating cytokines within the aqueous, vitreous, and subretinal space (notably but not exclusively transforming growth factor-\u03b2 [TGF-\u03b2]) that alter endogenous and exogenous intraocular antigens interacting with antigen-presenting cells resident within the trabecular meshwork and elsewhere in the uvea. Those antigen-presenting cells then leave the globe, enter the spleen, and specifically induce a population of splenic lymphocytes that will return to the globe as immune effector cells with very specific functional limitations. These splenic-origin B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocytes have impaired complement-fixing ability, little ability to induce a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, yet unimpaired antigen-specific cytotoxicity and production of non-complement-fixing antibody. In short, the immune response to intraocular antigenic challenge is specifically altered to limit those types of immune responses that typically have a lot of \"collateral damage,\" and to favor those very precise cytotoxic responses that typically have little bystander injury. Anterior segment immune deviation seems designed to dampen the significance of the \"day to day\" leakage of autoantigens and low-level exogenous antigens into the globe and is a critical component of immune tolerance to retinal and lens antigens. It is not effective if there is a break in the bloodeye barrier that allows large amounts of exogenous antigen into the globe, or if there is any intraocular disease that counteracts the immunosuppressive effect of the constitutive intraocular cytokines or increases the release of autoantigens. Failure of anterior segment immune deviation therefore allows entry into the globe by immunocytes capable of activating complement and triggering delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions that are unacceptably damaging to the globe. Without proof, we assume that most of the clinical and histologic manifestations of \"idiopathic\" lymphocytic uveitis are manifestations of a failure in this immune deviation.",

Edema accompanies the newly formed vessels. The chorioretinitis may be sufficiently exudative to cause multifocal retinal separation. As these severe uveal lesions regress during clinically quiescent periods, they leave behind characteristic residual changes. Relatively early in the disease, there is the development of perivascular lymphoid aggregates in the iris and ciliary body that persist and may even form true lymphoid nodules (Fig. 5-47 ).

The most compelling single candidate for an etiologic agent is Leptospira interrogans serovar pomona, which can induce the syndrome after experimental introduction of bacteremia by subcutaneous inoculation. Leptospiral antigens or DNA have been repeatedly demonstrated within the globe of 50-70% of horses with classic clinical and histologic changes of equine recurrent uveitis. The problem, however, is that not all cases can be blamed on this agent. Various studies in various parts of the world have implicated other leptospiral serovars; various other bacterial, viral, protozoal, and other infectious agents; or even reaction to endogenous antigens. For most, the evidence is not compelling. Over the years, interest in pursuing the cause of the initial uveitis has faded as our collective interest in understanding the recurrent and progressive nature of this disease has focused more on the probability that the persistent disease is not caused by persistence of leptospiral or other infection as much as by the triggering of autoimmunity by impairment of anterior segment immune deviation or increased production of autoantigens. There is cross-reactivity between leptospiral antigens and equine corneal endothelial, lenticular, and retinal antigens. Horses with recurrent uveitis have intravitreal antibody and CD4+ T cells directed against numerous retinal antigens, and at least some of those antigens will stimulate uveitis when injected into the equine vitreous. They also have an increase in MHC II antigen-presenting cells within the choroid. The predominant cells within the anterior uvea of horses with chronic equine recurrent uveitis are CD4+ T cells, implying a Th1 inflammatory reaction. All of this points to the probability that the initial uveitis substantially alters the character of the intraocular environment so that immune privilege no longer exists, and the globe becomes susceptible to the potentially injurious effects of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous antigens unrelated to what caused the initial uveitis. At least in the case of leptospirosis, some of the persisting inflammation may represent humoral and cellular reaction to retinal and other autoantibodies that cross-react with leptospiral glycoproteins.",

Phacolytic uveitis is a mild lymphocytic-plasmacytic anterior uveitis that occurs in response to the leakage of denatured lens protein through an intact lens capsule, which occurs regularly in the course of maturation of cataracts toward total liquefaction. Some degree of phacolytic uveitis is assumed to occur in virtually all animals with cataract.

Even in adult dogs, the disease in unpredictable, so owners' questions about the risk of phacoclastic uveitis as the justification for surgical removal of a perforated lens cannot be answered with certainty.

In the cornea, increased aqueous pressure injures the corneal endothelium, resulting in diffuse edema and eventual fibrosis and vascularization. If buphthalmos occurs, corneal stretching results in rents in Descemet's membrane, visible clinically as corneal striae (Fig.  5-54 ). These are relatively most frequent in horses and least prevalent in cats with glaucoma. Failure of lids to cover the enlarged globe permits corneal desiccation and eventual ulceration with all its sequels.

Cataract is usual, presumably the result of stagnation of aqueous humor and subsequent lens malnutrition. Iris and ciliary body undergo bland atrophy, most obvious as thinning and flattening of ciliary processes. Collapse of the ciliary cleft and trabecular meshwork itself is frequent and makes evaluation of these structures for possible goniodysgenesis very difficult.

The large, open network of cords occupying most of the ciliary cleft is the uveal trabecular meshwork; anterior and external to it is a more compressed network called the corneoscleral trabecular meshwork. Ordinarily, aqueous humor produced by the ciliary processes passes through the pupil, through the pectinate ligament, and then through the uveal and corneoscleral trabecular meshworks en route to the scleral venous plexus that will return the aqueous to the systemic circulation (Fig. 5-57) . Improper development or acquired obstruction of any part of this drainage pathway may result in glaucoma, but one must remember that the ciliary cleft extends 360 degrees around the iridocorneal angle. Blockage of most of it is required for the development of glaucoma, and this assessment is virtually impossible with 2-dimensional histologic examination. It is quite common to encounter dog eyes (~3% of aqueous outflow) reliance on alternative outflow pathways. In dogs, alternative drainage routes account for 15-25% of all outflow. The existence of these alternative routes may explain the absence of glaucoma in some eyes (especially in horses) in which the angle changes would ordinarily have resulted in glaucoma, and may even explain the presence of glaucoma in eyes with apparently normal angles but lesions affecting portions of these other potential drainage routes.",

Although, theoretically, primary glaucoma may have no visible angle lesion (which is frequently the case in humans), in dogs there is almost always a readily detected maldevelopment. The one exception is primary open-angle glaucoma in Beagle dogs, in which there is no visible antecedent lesion. The broad term goniodysgenesis encompasses all developmental defects of the filtration angle, of which 2 types account for most canine cases. The most prevalent is continuation of mature iris stroma across the most anterior face of the trabecular meshwork to insert into the termination of Descemet's membrane. Some consider this an example of dysplasia of the pectinate ligament, alternatively known as imperforate pectinate ligament. The band is much thicker than pectinate ligament and lacks the appropriate perforation to allow the drainage of aqueous humor. The trabecular meshwork posterior/exterior to this broad mesenchymal band often seems normal, although that is quite variable (Fig. 5-58A ). It is seen as a breed-related and thus presumably inherited defect in Bouvier des Flandres, Basset Hounds, American Cocker Spaniels, Dandie Dinmont Terriers, Siberian Huskies, Samoyeds, Chows, and numerous other breeds. The defect, and the resultant glaucoma, is occasionally seen in mixed-breed dogs. The pectinate dysplasia is usually bilateral but not necessarily of equal extent, perhaps explaining why the glaucoma is often present initially only in one eye. The prevalence of pectinate dysplasia is much higher than the prevalence of glaucoma, and even in dogs with very extensive dysplasia that should seemingly eliminate almost all aqueous drainage, the onset of glaucoma is not until several years of age. It is not unusual to have cases in which clinically detected glaucoma was delayed until 8-10 years of age. Age-related changes in outflow resistance within the alternative routes of aqueous outflow have been postulated as the explanation, as develop glaucoma subsequent to episodes of mild uveitis or ocular trauma that might cause some additional degree of aqueous outflow obstruction simply by accumulation of red cells, fibrin, or leukocytes.",

Continuing to breed dogs with abnormal angles increases the prevalence of glaucoma within that line. It may be that the goniodysgenesis that is visible clinically and histologically is not the direct cause for the glaucoma, but a marker for some other defect in trabecular development that is the real cause of the glaucoma.

Many horses with glaucoma have a clinical history of previous uveitis, but histologic assessment of the glaucomatous globe usually reveals very little evidence of that inflammation and no obvious connection between the inflammation and the development of glaucoma. In those horses with glaucoma in which the membrane had not apparently crossed the pectinate ligament, glaucoma may have been caused by obstruction of alternative uveal routes of aqueous outflow, which are more important in horses than in dogs or cats. of the lens, so iridolenticular adhesion from pre-iridal fibrovascular membrane or even just fibrin alone is always a risk. The most common stimuli for the development of pre-iridal fibrovascular membranes are retinal detachment, intraocular neoplasia (particularly iridociliary tumors), corneal angiogenesis, and chronic uveitis. All result in increased circulating levels of vascular endothelial growth factor within the aqueous humor. Less prevalent than pupillary block caused by pre-iridal fibrovascular membrane (at least in histologic specimens) is posterior synechia caused by fibrinous effusion from the iris in the course of any anterior uveitis. With pupillary block of any cause, the continued production of aqueous humor in the presence of pupillary obstruction results in characteristic forward bowing of the iris known as iris bomb\u00e9 (Fig. 5-60A ). Subsequent to the development of iris bomb\u00e9, the glaucoma is therefore caused not only by the initial pupillary obstruction but also by peripheral anterior synechia as the forward bulging of the iris effectively seals the iridocorneal angle. Anterior synechia occurring independently of iris bomb\u00e9 is an occasional cause of secondary glaucoma. Because the iris does not normally contact the cornea, anterior synechia unrelated to iris bomb\u00e9 is frequent only as a consequence of corneal perforation, in which case the iris flows forward as an iris prolapse to seal the defect and may then adhere diffusely to the corneal endothelium ( Fig. 5-60B) .",

Posterior migration by corneal endothelium to cover the anterior face of the pectinate ligament and iris is seen quite frequently and may represent an important mechanism for the development of secondary glaucoma, even though the cause for the endothelial migration is usually not obvious. It may be particularly important as a trigger for the still unexplained delayed onset of glaucoma in adult dogs with lifelong goniodysgenesis.

Greater than 80% of glaucoma in cats can be attributed to 1 of 2 diseases: diffuse iris melanoma and chronic idiopathic lymphonodular uveitis.

Although no actual data are published, most animals with encephalitis do not, in fact, have concurrent retinitis. Retinal inflammation is most often the result of spread from choroid or across the vitreous from anterior uvea. Degenerations are much more common than inflammations and are not usually accompanied by inflammatory reaction.

Even the fetal retina has poor regenerative capacity, as evidenced by the prevalence of retinal dysplasia following prenatal or neonatal retinal injury.

The accumulation of outer nuclear layer axons and inner nuclear layer dendrites forms the outer synaptic or plexiform layer. The inner nuclear layer contains the nuclei of the bipolar, horizontal, amacrine, and glial (Muller) cells. The bipolar cells receive impulses from the photoreceptors and relay them to ganglion cells. The bipolar cells also stimulate the horizontal cells, which transmit the impulse horizontally to excite adjacent bipolar cells. Amacrine cells counterbalance the bipolar cells in that their stimulation releases an inhibitor of ganglion cell excitation. The glial cells are primarily structural support cells, whose processes traverse the retina to form the retinal scaffold, and their anterior and posterior terminations fuse to form the inner and outer limiting membranes. The axons of the bipolar and amacrine cells, dendrites of ganglion and horizontal cells, and glial processes form the thick inner synaptic or plexiform layer. The ganglion cell layer is the thinnest and innermost of the neuronal layers. Large, granular neurons form a single and often sparse layer, supplemented by a few astrocytes, which become bilayered in the area centralis to accommodate the marked increase in photoreceptor density. The density of ganglion cells predicts, in a general way, visual acuity. They are most closely packed in animals requiring fine visual discrimination (most birds, predatory fish, many reptiles). In contrast, they are sparse in ungulates who do not feed by sight but who flee at anything that moves.

Carnivores, ruminants, and swine have large venules and smaller arterioles radiating from the optic disc to the peripheral retina. The horse has ~60 thin, short vessels extending from the disc for ~5 mm into surrounding retina. In dogs and cats, the major vessels lie within the deep half of the nerve fiber layer and the ganglion cell layer. In ruminants and pigs, the vessels are very superficial and bulge into the vitreous, covered only by a thin layer of nerve fibers and basal lamina. The retinal vessels form an end-artery circulation that supplies the inner layers of the retina. The photoreceptors and outer nuclear layers are avascular and receive nutrients primarily by diffusion from choroid. Such dependence cannot be absolute (except in horses) because degeneration of these outer layers is surprisingly slow (weeks to months) following retinal separation. In contrast, occlusion of a retinal vessel results in focal infarction of the inner retina within <1 hour.",

Saline extracts of retina yield the retinal S antigen, and the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein between RPE and photoreceptors, by contraction of a cyclitic membrane, or by the subretinal leakage of liquefied vitreous through retinal tears.

The credibility of the diagnosis is greatly enhanced by the presence of subretinal exudates or cyclitic membranes, but in their absence, the diagnosis rests upon the observation of photoreceptor outer segment degeneration, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of pigmented epithelium, and the development of marked edema in inner nuclear, ganglion cell, and inner plexiform layers (Fig. 5-63A-C) . Hypertrophy of the RPE is the most rapid change, occurring within a few hours of separation. The edematous changes are visible with the light microscope as early as 3 days following experimentally induced separation in owl monkeys. Coalescence of the edema creates a virtual cleavage of inner from outer retina, called retinoschisis. The cleavage is spanned by the radial Muller fibers, which seem the only anchors holding the retina together. Photoreceptor degeneration is slower to appear under the light microscope, with loss of outer segments (probably the most subtle change that can be unequivocally diagnosed with routine light microscopy) visible by ~14 days after experimental saline-induced \"exudative\" retinal detachment. It is probably much faster than that when the exudate is full of noxious byproducts of cell necrosis and inflammation, but no precise figure is available. Inner segments and the cell bodies of the outer nuclear layer are almost unaffected and may remain so for months, suggesting that their maintenance is not so intimately linked to the pigment epithelium as is the case with the outer segments. This temporal hierarchy of change permits reasonably accurate aging of retinal separations, sometimes a necessary or at least interesting assessment in eyes enucleated after numerous clinical examinations or manipulation. The outer retinal membranes are seen with chronic detachments and originate from RPE or Muller cells. The RPE retains mitotic ability. When injured, these cells respond with hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and fibrous metaplasia. The presence of pigment in the neuroretina is frequent in instances of retinal atrophy, most probably derived from migration of retinal pigment epithelial cells into the adjacent retina.",

The axons travel within a preformed neuroectodermal tube formed by the primary optic stalk to reach the optic chiasm and then the lateral geniculate body. The neuroectoderm lining the optic stalk induces the surrounding mesenchyme to form the 3 meningeal layers, similar to and continuous with those of brain itself. Later differentiation of neuroectoderm produces astrocytes and oligodendroglia that, together with the ganglion cell, axons, and fibrovascular septa from pia mater, form the substance of the optic nerve. The optic disc is the intraocular portion of the nerve and is the only portion available to ophthalmoscopic examination. It is formed by the convergence of ganglion cell axons prior to their exit via the lamina cribrosa. The axons of the nerve fiber layer are unmyelinated, and at what point (relative to lamina cribrosa) the axons become myelinated determines the ophthalmoscopic appearance of the optic disc. Histologically, the disc is unmyelinated in most domestic species except the dog, contains abundant glia, and may have a small paracentral excavation-the physiologic cup-from which Bergmeister's papilla originates. A few pigmented cells are commonly seen, as are small neuroblastic clusters, both probably minor anomalies of retinal differentiation but of no significance.

Pathologists get a very biased view of the relative importance of neoplasia overall within the world of veterinary ophthalmology simply because virtually every globe containing a neoplasm is going to be submitted for histologic assessment. At least in dogs and cats, which are the species from which we are most likely to receive histologic specimens for assessment, neoplasia is second only to glaucoma as a cause for enucleation. Primary ocular tumors may arise from the eyelids and adnexa, from optic nerve, or from within the globe. Those arising within the globe may originate from any of the tissues, but only those from uveal melanocytes and iridociliary neuroectoderm are anything other than rare. Most primary intraocular tumors have negligible potential for metastasis. Dogs and cats are most frequently affected; primary intraocular neoplasms are inexplicably rare in other domestic species.",

In cattle, in which this disease is of greatest significance, the prevalence is highest in the \"white-faced\" Hereford breed and in the high-altitude regions of the Canadian and American West. It also occurs in other breeds of cattle, as well as Indian water buffalo, sheep, and cattalo. Variation in prevalence in different lines of Herefords, even in the same region, has led to speculation that other genetic factors within the breed, other than facial pigmentation, may influence susceptibility. The question of etiology has been further widened by demonstration of papillomaviruses in some of the papillomatous precursor lesions that eventually transform into squamous cell carcinoma. Similar papillomaviruses, as well as being the causative agents of cutaneous warts, have been demonstrated in bovine alimentary papillomas in Scotland, and viral DNA persists in the squamous cell carcinomas that arise from these papillomas in cattle grazing pastures that contain bracken fern. It remains to be determined whether or not there is any relationship between a viral component of the ocular carcinoma and the fact that, in many cases, the tumor regresses after immunotherapy. At least at the moment, no viral particle or viral genome has been consistently demonstrated in ocular squamous cell carcinomas in any species.

It is inexplicably rare in cats, and virtually nonexistent in other domestic species. It is comparable in many respects to sebaceous adenomas found elsewhere in the skin. However, these tumors originate specifically from Meibomian gland and not from other eyelid sebaceous glands, and have several distinctive histologic features that distinguish them from \"ordinary\" sebaceous adenomas. The similarities, however, are stronger than the differences. Like sebaceous adenomas elsewhere, they are has not been correlated with histologic criteria, but there is a correlation between site of origin and subsequent behavior. Most surveys in cattle identify the bulbar conjunctiva of the limbus as the most frequent site of origin, estimated at ~70% of all occurrences. Some surveys consider nictitating membrane as next most frequent, with palpebral conjunctiva of the true eyelid as third. Other reports claim nictitans origin to be uncommon, and eyelid tumors to be as common as those of limbic origin. Tumors arise only very rarely from the cornea because of the limited mitotic capability of that tissue. Apparent corneal tumors are almost always extensions from tumors arising at the limbus. Tumors arising at the limbus are confronted by the dense and poorly vascularized connective tissue of sclera and peripheral cornea, which retards metastasis to extraocular sites. Invasion of corneal stroma and sclera occurs slowly, but intraocular invasion is very uncommon (Fig. 5-73 ). Tumors arising from the nictitans extend to the root of the membrane and then to the cartilage and bone of the orbit and internal nares. Metastasis probably will eventually occur in all instances, with parotid lymph node the initial site. Wide dissemination to thoracic and abdominal organs has been reported and is probably limited only by the limited longevity of the target animals. Squamous cell carcinoma of the equine eye is much less thoroughly documented, but is quite common. In contrast to cattle, the preferred site is the edge of the third eyelid, followed by limbic bulbar conjunctiva. This targeting is, again, inversely correlated with the presence of protective melanin pigmentation, and is positively correlated with those factors causing increased exposure to UV radiation. In some reports, heavy draft horses are predisposed, but all breeds may be affected. The mean age of affected horses is ~9 years. Bilateral involvement is seen in 15-20%. The same range of precancerous lesions occurs in horses as in cattle. Prognosis is strongly influenced by therapy, but even the untreated neoplasm is slow to metastasize, and even then it is usually only to local lymph nodes. Retrospective studies document 10-15% of equine ocular squamous cell carcinomas to have regional or distant spread, but the data do not consider duration of the disease prior to therapy.",

Their prevalence increases dramatically in geographic regions with a lot of sunlight. They usually arise in the very superficial subepithelial vascular plexus. There is virtually no metastatic risk regardless of cytologic and histologic criteria of malignancy, but postoperative recurrence is common, probably because of de novo tumors forming from precancerous lesions elsewhere in the irradiated conjunctiva ( Fig. 5-77) . Behaviorally malignant examples seem more prevalent in horses, where more than half of the reported cases are solid hemangiosarcomas with very aggressive local infiltration and, usually, distant metastasis. They are easily mistaken A B formed by a purely expansile population of sebaceous lobules populated by variable proportions of germinal basal cells and more mature sebaceous cells (Fig. 5-75A ). There is no prognostic significance to the wide range in the relative proportions of these 2 populations, and therefore no justification for dividing these very common tumors into Meibomian adenoma versus Meibomian epithelioma (the latter referring to those tumors with a \"higher\" proportion of basal cells). Behavioral malignancy is exceedingly rare. Features that are distinctive for Meibomian adenoma that are not seen in sebaceous adenomas elsewhere include the presence of lipid lakes and foamy macrophages around the periphery of the tumor, and papillary hyperplasia of the squamous epithelium at the eyelid margin overlying the tumor (Fig. 5-75B ). Both of these secondary phenomena may actually be more prominent than the tumor itself. The accumulation of macrophages and lipid is known as chalazion. The macrophages may form multinucleated giant cells, and they contain distinctive clear split-like cytoplasmic inclusions that are unique to chalazion and not seen in the granulomatous reaction that may occasionally surround sebaceous adenomas found elsewhere in skin.

The syndrome was originally described as a bilateral but asymmetrical massive pigmentation of the uveal tract of Cairn Terrier dogs that seemed to be causing glaucoma. Histologically, the anterior uvea and even the choroid are thickened by a heavy, diffuse accumulation of large plump cells histologically indistinguishable from those of ordinary canine anterior uveal melanocytoma. The syndrome has been described in a few other breeds in association with glaucoma, but the syndrome remains controversial because one can encounter equally heavy pigmentation in clinically normal globes from breeds that typically have very heavy pigmentation, such as Kerry Blue Terriers, Scottish Terriers, black Labradors, and others. The causal relationship between the pigmentation and glaucoma therefore remains somewhat controversial. Some would prefer to refer to the disease as \"canine diffuse uveal melanosis,\" or even as diffuse uveal melanocytoma. Original claims that these accumulating cells are abnormal melanocytes have been challenged by recent electron microscopy, sclera, peripheral cornea, and ciliary body. The tumor cells are notoriously pleomorphic, and are apt to be misdiagnosed by those pathologists not aware of this disease as malignant lymphoma or anaplastic metastatic malignancy. Tumor cells vary from spindle-shaped cells to multinucleated epithelioid cells (Fig. 5-79B-D) . Pigmentation often is light, and the cytoplasm may be foamy and eosinophilic. Balloon cells with foamy cytoplasm and very distinct cell boundaries are frequent in some tumors. The accurate prediction of tumor behavior is compromised, in all published studies, by the low percentage of affected cats available for follow-up. Metastasis has been correlated with large tumor size and intrascleral spread. There remains a substantial gap between the prevalence of clinically significant metastatic disease and the presence of metastatic foci as detected by imaging or postmortem. It appears that the tumor foci within lung or other distant sites usually grow just as slowly as did the primary uveal tumor, and these cats rarely develop clinical signs of metastatic spread. There is no proof that early enucleation influences the risk of metastatic spread or the risk of metastatic disease. indicating that the majority of the accumulating cells are melanin-laden macrophages. That is perhaps not surprising, and it does not rule out the possibility that this is indeed a melanocytic proliferative disorder that, over time, has had a lot of leakage of melanin and thus a lot of macrophage recruitment.",

Most of these tumors appear to be fibrosarcomas, but some have a mixed epithelialmesenchymal phenotype, and elaborate basement membranetype matrix as well as express vimentin strongly.

Medulloepitheliomas may originate from any portion of embryonic neuroectoderm and may show differentiation into any neuroectodermal derivative, that is, retina, ciliary epithelium, vitreous, or neuroglia ( Fig. 5-81A , B). The typical neoplasm is a loose network of branching cords of small basophilic neuroblasts resembling those of embryonic retina. Mitotic figures are numerous. The neuroblasts may form cords reminiscent of ciliary processes, or form primitive rosette-like structures around a lumen of fibrillar hyaluronic acid matrix reminiscent of vitreous. Many tumors also contain foci of cartilage, skeletal muscle, or brain tissue and are classified as teratoid medulloepitheliomas. Metastases are very rare, despite many of these being classified histologically as \"malignant.\" A B metaplasia is quite common. Metastasis appears to be extremely infrequent.",

Depending on the species, 3-5 rows of outer hair cells overlie the basilar membrane, all extending the length of the cochlea and representing 75-80% of the sensory cell population in the cochlea. Between the inner and outer hair cells is the inner tunnel (tunnel of Corti) formed by the inner and outer pillar cells. These cells align such that they have interlocked heads nearest the tectorial membrane but broader feet that are in contact with the basilar membrane, forming a triangular tunnel. These cells contain networks of microtubules conferring a region of rigidity. The inner edge of the inner pillar cell is in close apposition to the spiral osseous lamina and is the functional fulcrum for basilar membrane deflection. Outer hair cells align adjacent to the outer pillar cells and have basal support from outer phalangeal cells (Deiters' cells) containing structural microtubules and microfilaments that provide rigidity. Outer phalangeal cells fittingly have a phalangeal process that provides support to outer hair cells through apical tight junctions. Several other epithelial and supporting cells function in part to facilitate potassium recycling through gap junctions and also via tight junctions to maintain the electrical and potassium potential in endolymph. Outer hair cells have a fraction of the afferent nerve fibers relative to inner hair cells but receive significant efferent innervation. Fluid-wave deflections lead to depolarization of outer hair cells as described previously, but are directly related to tectorial membrane movement within which outer hair cell apical stereocilia are embedded. Unique to the outer hair cells is the ability to lengthen and shorten through voltagedependent conformational change of a membrane protein, prestin, related to binding or release of chloride anions. This size variation is termed electromotility, whereby outer hair cells are essentially small cellular motors that fluctuate their linear length. Inner hair cells and vestibular hair cells lack this electromotility. Functionally, outer hair cells are part of a feedback loop. Sound-induced afferent neural traffic to the brainstem trapezoid nuclei return efferent signals to modify outer hair cell shape and responsiveness, serving to amplify or dampen sound detected by inner hair cells and help acoustically tune incoming sound to the appropriate region of the cochlea.

Initially, permeability was increased, but with chronicity, the permeability decreased. In swine, suppurative otitis media most commonly caused by \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci resulted in neutrophilic infiltration of the cochlea, sacculus, and utriculus, but lacked widespread infiltration into the osseous labyrinth. Canine distemper virus has been implicated as a cause of labyrinthitis that likely penetrates the membranous labyrinth via a hematogenous route. Inclusion bodies are observed in the cells in the middle and internal ear. Rarely, fungal infections, such as Cryptococcus spp., have been associated with feline labyrinthitis. A single case of disseminated canine protothecosis with BAER-confirmed deafness reported abundant Prototheca zopfii in the cochlea, along with a prominent plasmacytic infiltrate. Reported disruptions to the spiral organ were likely artifacts related to tissue processing.

Doberman Pinschers, Beagles, English Cocker Spaniels, German Shepherd dogs, Akitas, and Asian cat breeds (Siamese, Tonkinese, Burmese) develop vestibular disease early in life, in which spontaneous nystagmus is usually absent and central compensation over time lessens signs.

Postganglionic neuronal axons pass through the tympanic bulla along the ventral surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone and possibly join the tympanic plexus, a group of parasympathetic preganglionic axons of the glossopharyngeal nerve. In small animals, otitis media can lead to sympathetic postganglionic neuronal axon dysfunction, leading to the hallmark signs of Horner syndrome, namely, miosis, enophthalmos, narrowing of the palpebral fissure, and protrusion of the third eyelid. Horner syndrome associated with otitis media is more commonly seen in cats than dogs. Otitis media in horses and other farm animals does not affect these sympathetic postganglionic neurons, likely reflecting anatomic differences.

In cats, amikacin exerts its effects almost exclusively on the cochlear hair cells, whereas gentamicin more specifically caused hair cell damage to vestibular maculae.

Penetration into the internal ear may occur via the internal acoustic meatus or lytic necrosis of the petrous portion of the temporal bone as cranial nerve neoplasms expand and compress. A cranial nerve hamartoma involving CN VIII has been reported in a single dog. Intracranial meningiomas are the most commonly reported tumor in dogs, leading to vestibular signs. The expansile growth and compression of portions of the brain and ear important for vestibular function are the reason for clinical signs of dysfunction. Lymphosarcoma of multiple CNs has been reported in a Persian cat with associated vestibular signs. Holland CT, et communication with the perilymph of the scala vestibuli of the basal portion of the cochlea. The facial canal (Fallopian canal) initially branches from the internal acoustic meatus, following a path that resembles a Z-shape, with the facial nerve emerging caudal to the EAM through the stylomastoid foramen. Midway through the canal, the facial nerve is exposed to the tympanic cavity, lacking a complete bony shell known as the facial canal foramen (see Fig. 5-85 ). Through this opening emerges the tendon of the stapedius muscle that attaches to the head of the stapes. The stapedius muscle originates from the stapedius muscular fossa, a shallow depression within the facial canal. Tympanic cavities represent the middle ear air-filled compartments. Ventrally, this cavity is demarcated by the typically bulbous bony appendage known as the tympanic bulla. Tympanic bullae in cattle, goats, camelids, and pigs are septate, composed of numerous air-filled compartments with numerous interconnected bony septa. In dogs, cats, and sheep, tympanic bullae are large, typically singular, air-filled cavities surrounded by bone. In both the dog and cat, there is a central bony cleft, known as the septum bulla, which is incomplete in the dog and nearly complete in the cat. The horse has the shallowest bullae of all domestic species, and they are difficult to visualize externally. Short bony clefts span the bullae and subdivide them into several small, dished, bony cavities resulting in a partially septate tympanic cavity.",

The malleus has its longest appendage, the manubrium, embedded in the pars tensa of the tympanic membrane; is firmly articulated with the incus; and is anchored dorsally in the epitympanic recess. The long crus of the incus articulates with the head of the stapes via its terminal lenticular process. Sound-induced tympanic membrane vibrations result in piston-like oscillation of the stapes anchored in the vestibular window by the stapedial annular ligament. Inherent to transducing sound energy from air (low impedance) to cochlear fluid (higher impedance) is the need for impedance matching; otherwise, much of the sound energy would be reflected. Impedance transformer function of the middle ear is achieved in 3 ways. First, tympanic membrane surface area is far greater than the surface area of the foot plate of the stapes in the vestibular window, ~20:1 in the cat. Second, the long crus of the incus is much shorter than the manubrium of the malleus, resulting in a lever action that increases the force at the stapes, ~2:1 in the cat. The net effect is a maximal middle ear amplification of 43 in the cat. Third, air in the tympanic cavity provides stiffness with respect to sound vibrations across the tympanic membrane. As external sound frequencies decrease, the stiffness or acoustic impedance of the middle ear increases. Thus low-frequency sounds are more apt to be reflected away rather than transduced into cochlear waves and sound detection. However, as the volume of the middle ear cavity increases, the stiffness decreases in an inverse relationship. Therefore animals with larger tympanic bullae have reduced stiffness and a greater ability to hear a lower range of sound frequencies.",

Initially referred to as primary secretory otitis media (PSOM), in which Cavalier King Charles Spaniels were over-represented, more recent evidence points to a disease entity that is mostly silent clinically and therefore has greater similarities with OME. The tympanic membrane becomes opaque without evidence of rupture, and the pars flaccida may bulge laterally into the external acoustic meatus.

In sheep, cattle, dogs, cats, rabbits, and foxes, the face, particularly the ears, feet, and dorsum, may develop erythematous papules and pustules with crusts. Histologic features include intraepidermal pustular dermatitis, and superficial perivascular dermatitis and folliculitis. Surface crusts are typically thick and have alternating layers of keratin and suppurative exudate, referred to as palisading crusts. Canine leproid granuloma. First reported in Boxer dogs and Bullmastiffs, it has now been reported in a number of breeds. Affected animals, typically short-coated, large-breed dogs of any age or either sex, have one to multiple, wellcircumscribed, mildly painful, frequently ulcerated, firm papules, plaques, or nodules ranging from 2 mm to 5 cm in diameter. The pinna is most commonly affected, mostly on the convex surface or near the base.

Infections are thought to be the result of percutaneous inoculation of saprophytic organisms into wounds or by arthropods. Lesions are most commonly recognized during the warmest months of the year. Bacteria remain localized to the skin, with no reports of nodal or internal organ involvement. Lesions are localized, do not spread, and do not recur.",

The plane of section may be ventrodorsal through an opened tympanic bulla, with the blade directed through to the inner surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, or mediolateral, with the blade directed toward the external acoustic meatus. Either technique will allow assessment of most of the ear compartments in a single section.",

Instead of formic acidcontaining demineralization solutions, buffered, cold ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) solutions are used to slowly removed calcium from the otic capsule, a process that takes several months as opposed to days or weeks. Paraffinembedding is replaced with celloidin, and the process requires several steps that make use of chloroform. On average, nearly a full year after the temporal bones are collected, stained slides are available for histologic examination. The entire block is sectioned, and every tenth slide is stained. Complete assessment of all turns of the cochlea, the vestibular system, the middle ear cavity and associated structures, and the portion of external ear present encompasses more than 30 glass slides. The final product is absolutely gorgeous, with exquisite retention of detail of the spiral organ and vestibular membrane. This process is impractical for routine veterinary diagnostic laboratories.",

            "text": "Dyorho . Unlike most other papillomavirus infections, aural plaques are never observed in horses <1 year of age, and they do not spontaneously resolve or regress. Additionally, these pinnal lesions are primarily reported in the Northern Hemisphere and are believed to be associated with or spread by aural irritation by biting flies, especially blackflies (Simulium vittatum, S. argus).Epithelial tumors. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has long been associated with ulcerated, crusted, and bleeding lesions affecting the tips or caudal edges of the pinnae of cats. Reported as the most common neoplasm affecting the pinnae of cats and representing 2% of tumors in cats, the largest study to date determined that 95% of cases were in white or partially white cats, and the median age was 12 years. The vast majority of cases are bilateral-one reason this lesion is strongly correlated with prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Greater than 80% of pinnal SCC in cats overexpressed p53 protein. Morphologic features are typical for SCC. Complete resection of the pinna had the longest reported median survival times. The worst prognosis is reported in cats with concurrent pinnal and nasal planum involvement. Neoplasms can be locally invasive, involving other compartments of the ear or spread via lymphatics of the head and neck to the lungs.In sheep, precancerous lesions involving the ear typically begin as inflamed, highly proliferative lesions that may deform the entire ear. Papillomavirus most closely related to bovine papillomavirus 2 (BPV-2) transform into squamous cell carcinoma. Australian shepherds refer to this simply as \"ear cancer.\" Lesions may arise in regions of a previous ear-mark. An epizootic of aural papillomas was reported in a Polled Hereford herd involving one or both ears because of the presumptive spread of papillomavirus arising in the tattoo sites. Some lesions took 8 months to resolve.Either the base of the ear or pinna represents a common site for several epithelial growths mostly seen in dogs and cats. These include trichoblastomas, trichoepitheliomas, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, sebaceous gland adenoma, apocrine cysts, apocrine adenomas, and basal cell carcinomas. Malignant phenotypes of these tumors may also be recognized in this location. Epitrichial sweat gland tumors are benign neoplasms that commonly affect the pinna in horses. Viral-induced papillomas may also involve the pinnae in younger dogs.Common mesenchymal tumors of the ear. Similar to folliculosebaceous tumors indicated previously, mast cell tumors, histiocytomas, and plasmacytomas have a tendency to involve extremities, such as pinnae or the base of the ear.Aural melanoma (Angora goats, cats). Pinnal-associated melanomas can be classified into 3 broad groups: (1) congenital melanomas (cattle, swine), (2) feline dermal melanomas, and (3) dermal melanomas of Angora goats.Congenital neoplasms are rarely reported in domestic animals. There are even rarer case reports documenting dermal melanomas with pinnal involvement. One report documents a male, red Sindhi calf with a congenital pinnal melanoma that was discovered at birth, prompting curative pinnal amputation. One earlier report involved the root of the ear in a Japanese black bovid and 2 different cattle with left mandibular expansive masses that extended to include the ear canal or squamous temporal bone.Congenital melanocytic neoplasms have been documented as common in swine; however, most authors report the head but do not specifically list pinnae as a predilection site.",

            "text": "Raillietia spp. are tiny, blood-feeding mites that parasitize the deepest portions of the EAM and external surface of the tympanic membrane affecting cattle, goats, and buffalo in the Americas, Australia, Great Britain, Europe, and the Middle East. Infestations frequently go undetected because host species display no clinical disease, or tiny mites deep in the EAM remain obscured from otoscopic view because of thick plugs of exudate. External ear lesions include mild to moderate, suppurative otitis media, mild parakeratotic hyperkeratosis, and acanthosis, with an inflamed but typically intact tympanic membrane. Infrequently, tympanic membranes become perforated with mites also infesting the tympanic cavity, and animals develop suppurative otitis media as well as suppurative bulla osteitis, resulting in signs that may include ataxia, head tilt, circling, and inability to right themselves.In cattle and buffalo, Raillietia auris has been associated with transmission of a rhabditiform nematode, Rhabditis bovis. A link between Raillietia caprae infections in goats and concurrent Mycoplasma spp. isolated from the ears has been made, either related to acquisition through blood ingestion or possibly by transovarial or trans-stadial transmission. Finally, various other bacterial and fungal infections may be concurrently cultured from ruminants infected with Raillietia spp.Described as the most common parasite associated with otitis externa in dogs and cats, Otodectes cynotis is associated with severe pruritus and a dark otorrhea likened to ground coffee representing cerumen, keratin, exudation, and mite waste. It is estimated that >50% of feline otitis externa is related to O. cynotis infestations compared with 5-10% in dogs. These mites reside deep in the EAM and instigate intense epidermal irritation (Fig. 5-92 ). Mites feed on lymph and whole blood, resulting in introduction of salivary antigens and sensitization. Thus intensity of pruritus may be related to an underlying immediate-type or Arthus-type reaction. Protective immunity may develop in cats. Infestations are typically bilateral, and the mites are extremely contagious, often traveling from dam to nursing young. Histologic lesions include epidermal hyperplasia with mixed hyperkeratosis and crusts. Ceruminous glands are both hypertrophied and ectatic. A mixed infiltrate is present in the dermis, including lymphocytes and macrophages. Animals may develop auricular hematomas, otitis media, and vestibular dysfunction, and convulsions may occur with severe, long-standing infestations.There are several Psoroptes spp.; however, only P. cuniculi are found to preferentially infest ears of goats, sheep, horses, and rabbits. In some regions, coinfection with Raillietia spp.Dermal melanocytic neoplasms frequently affect dogs, and most are benign. In cats, melanomas are far less common, reportedly accounting for 0.5% of feline cutaneous neoplasms. Based on several studies, dermal melanomas in cats most frequently involve the head, and head tumors are most often pinnal. There is conflicting evidence in the literature regarding biological behavior of these aural tumors, with 2 large studies strongly asserting that pinnal melanomas are nearly uniformly benign, whereas a third retrospective study found 12% of aural melanomas were malignant.The final group involves ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced melanomas in Angora goats. The Angora breed is described as brown-eyed, white-skinned goats with dense pale mohair except for the ears, nose, and perineum. Prevalence rates are much higher in goats that graze in low latitudes, such as northern Africa, India, New Zealand, and Australia, where there is high solar UV exposure. The anatomic sites with the least protection from UV radiation include the dorsal, convex surface of the pinnae, base of the horn, and the perineum.Young goats in Australia were observed to develop lentigines (sharply circumscribed regions of epidermal hyperplasia confined to the epidermis) beginning at 3 months of age and peaking by 2 years of age. These benign proliferations remained unchanged in appearance and number between 2-3 years of age. Lentigines are considered possible but not obligate melanoma precursors.Malignant melanomas develop in older goats, with a peak age of 4-5 years of age. They are considered by many to be highly malignant, commonly spreading via lymphatics and blood vessels to regional lymph nodes, liver, and lungs as well as other parenchymal organs. Tumors tend to be multiple, dermoepidermal, or subcutaneous and black. Microscopic features include large, anaplastic epithelioid melanocytes mixed with spindle cells that are variably pigmented. Mitotic figures are numerous and frequently bizarre.Uncommon pinnal mesenchymal tumors. A small number of reports document uncommon causes of pinnal neoplasia in cats. Rhabdomyoma has been reported in a series of 4 cats as discoid, well-circumscribed, nonulcerated masses affecting the convex surface of the ear. Histologic features included whorls and bundles of spindle-shaped cells with cross-striations and rare mitotic activity. All cats were white and 6-7 years of age. Excision was curative in all cases.Cutaneous hemangiosarcomas are infrequently reported in cats. With a mean age of 12.5 years, 50% of reported cases affect the pinnae. Neoplastic endothelial cells displayed variable anisokaryosis, chromatin patterns, and mitotic index. Solar elastosis, acanthosis, ulceration, and hemorrhage were reported in several cases. Most of the affected cats were white.Rarely, fibromas and fibrosarcomas have been reported in cats and dogs, and a single case of a fibroleiomyoma was reported in a pig. Sarcoids may involve any location in horses and cats but have been reported to commonly involve the head and pinnae of cats.",
