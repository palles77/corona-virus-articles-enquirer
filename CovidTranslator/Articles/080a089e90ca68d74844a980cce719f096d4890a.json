To determine the possible role of common enteric pathogens in this disease, 40 veal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis (cases) and 25 dairy calves diagnosed with enteric infection (control) were investigated. The veal calves were negative for several known enteric pathogens except for pathogenic Escherichia coil isolates that expressed multiple virulence attributes. To determine whether such isolates have a significant association with hemorrhagic enteritis in veal calves, we compared the prevalence of pathogenic E. coli in the 40 veal calves with the prevalence of similar E. coil in the dairy calves that were diagnosed with colibacillosis within the same season of the year. Escherichia coil isolates from the two groups of calves were tested for several properties orE. coil related to pathogenicity, i.e. production of verotoxins, heat-stable enterotoxin (STa), heat-labile enterotoxin, enterohemolysin, K99 fimbrial antigens, hemagglutination activity, and attachment to Hep-2 tissue culture cells. Escherichia coil that produce ST a were more commonly isolated from veal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis (45%) than from dairy calves with enteritis (12%) ( P < 0.05 ). Various patterns of attachment of E. coil to Hep-2 tissue culture cells were studied. The E. coil that demonstrated aggregative patterns of attachment were more commonly represented in veal calves (32%) than in dairy calves (8%). We observed that there was no correlation between STa production and K99 pill expression among the enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) isolates that were recovered from veal calves.",

            "text": "A fatal syndrome of veal calves which often includes hemorrhagic diarrhea has recently become a major concern of the veal calf industry in the midwestern United States. This disease has many synonyms including 'hemorrhagic veal calf disease', 'bloody scours', 'bloody calf disease' etc. The disease is characterized in the live calf primarily by anorexia, fever, diarrhea with mucus-containing stools which become bloody in the later stages, and hemorrhagic diathesis on the conjunctival surface of the eyes and the mucus surfaces of the mouth and nose (Espinasse et al., 1973; Harrison, 1978) . Although no epidemiological surveys have been completed, this syndrome potentially is a source of considerable economic loss to veal calf producers. Until 1989, the Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (ADDL), Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, had examined veal calves with the signs and symptoms of generalized hemorrhagic disease. No specific etiologic agents which may relate to the condition were identified except the isolation of Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD) virus from three cases (18%). According to the reports of the virology section of the ADDL (Dr. C. Kanitz, personal communication, 1992) , in over 70% of tissue specimens and fecal samples submitted from cattle and calves, BVD virus had been demonstrated by fluorescent microscopic examination of tissue culture inoculated with these specimens. Moreover, a large number of serum samples can be found positive for BVD virus. However, such demonstration of BVD virus clues could only be significant when suggestive lesions are recorded or a significant rise in serum titer is measured from paired sera. Calf scours is a disease complex and a number of different organisms have been associated with its etiology. The most common organisms are enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Salmonella sp., Campylobacter sp., rota, corona, and BVD viruses, as well as some parasitic agents such as Cryptosporidium (Acres et al., 1977; Smith and Linggood, 1972 ) .",

The disease strikes healthy calves 7-10 days after entry to the farm. It was described as an initial febrile condition with a temperature of 39-41 \u00b0C, yellow loose stools which become bloody in the later stages, variable appetite during the course of illness, dehydration and cachexia at the terminal stage of the disease. The morbidity rate of this syndrome was estimated to be 30% with a case fatality rate approaching 80%. All the calves on this farm were male Holsteins purchased at an average weight of 45-52 kg from different markets and were kept in individual stalls with replacement on an all-in all-out basis. Feeding and the feeding schedule was supplied by the Real Veal Co., (Ixonia, WI) an important supplier of veal calf formula in the area. Bovitec (Lasolicid) was given as a routine feed medication. The following antibiotics and antibacterial agents were used in the treatment of affected calves as well as prophylactically on healthy calves during the 2 week period of the disease outbreak: Neomycin, Penicillin, Oxytetracycline, Nitrofurazone, Furazolidone, Sulfamethazin, and Sulfamethaxazole. Several drugs on this list were used on several occasions by the farmer without veterinary advice. All treatments failed to alter the course of the disease.",

The 40 diarrheic and dehydrated Holstein calves comprised two groups. Each group was chosen from a barn to include the 20 calves that were most recently identified as having the disease. The estimated age of these animals was 2 weeks (only estimation of the ages of auction-purchased calves was possible).

The diagnosis of colibacillosis in these cases was confirmed by microbiologic testing for the absence of other major bacterial, viral, and parasitic etiologies that are often associated with calf scours. Only 25 such animals were identified throughout the period of the study. These criteria for selection of control calves were chosen after the conclusion that the strains of E. coli that were isolated from the 40 veal calves (cases) expressed multiple virulence factors.

These samples were submitted to the clinical pathology laboratory for hematologic analysis (total protein, fibrinogen, hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), total count of white blood cells (CWBC), differential white blood cells count, platelets count, and morphologic examination of the blood cells) and for determination of selenium and vitamin E levels. Based on previous cases of veal calf hemorrhagic enteritis that were investigated by the ADDL, no specific viral etiology was identified. However, the paired sera collected from the five calves were tested for serum neutralization titers to BVD, corona and rota viruses. Fecal and/or rectal swab samples collected from the 40 veal calves and from the 25 dairy calves (E. coli cultures from cases of colibacillosis were stored and maintained by the ADDL according to a collaborative project between the ADDL and the Department of Veterinary Pathobiology at Purdue University), were processed for common enteric bacterial pathogens following standard procedures (Nagy et al., 1976; Moon et al., 1977; Carter and Cole., 1990) . Ten well isolated smooth colonies with an appearance typical of E. coli were chosen from MacConkey plates. Selection was made by placing the plate on a paper grid; two colonies were picked from each quarter that showed discrete colonies of bacterial growth. With the size of the grid used, most of the areas of discrete bacterial growth were covered. The rectal swabs or fecal samples were also inoculated on Campy-Bap medium containing 5% sheep blood and antibiotic supplementation (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, MD) and incubated in an anaerobic jar with a Campy-Pak (BBL Microbiology Systems). The jars were sealed and incubated at 42 \u00b0C for 48 h. The plates were examined for Campylobacter organisms following standard procedures. For Salmonella isolation, each rectal swab or fecal sample was inoculated into a tube with 10 ml of Selenite enrichment broth and incubated at 42 \u00b0 C for 24 h. Samples from each tube were streaked onto Brilliant Green agar plates with and without Novobiocin. After 24 h incubation at 37 \u00b0 C, the plates were examined for suggestive Salmonella growth and if positive were confirmed by standard biochemical and serologic methods. All E. coli isolates from both veal calves and dairy calves were subcultured on Minca Isovitalex agar plates and tested for K99 fimbrial antigen (Guinee et al., 1977) . Escherichia coli growth on this medium was also tested for hemagglutination (HA) as described by Evans et al. (1980) . Testing ofE. coli for enterotoxin production was performed by growing the isolates on casamino acid-yeast extract (CAYE) medium for the production of heat-stable enterotoxin (STa) and heat-labile enterotoxin (Guerrant et al., 1974; Saeed et al., 1984) , on Trypticase Soy Broth (BBL Microbiology Systems) for verotoxin (VT) production and testing as described by Karmali et al. ( 1985 ) . Escherichia coli isolates were tested for enterohemolysin as described by Beutin et al. (1988) . The test for attachment to Hep-2 cells was performed as described by Cravioto et al. ( 1979 ) and interpreted according to Nataro et al. (1987) . Five pools of E. coli colonies (two colonies per pool) for each fecal swab or sample were tested from each veal and dairy calf in this study. Positive test results by any pool were included in the overall classification ofE. coli isolates from the respective calf. However, the profile presented belonged to the single bacterial pool that expressed the largest number of virulence factors. The association of the virulence factors with E. coli isolates from veal calves and dairy calves was tested by univariate analysis using X 2 statistics (Fleiss, 1981 ) . The association of virulent E. coli with hemorrhagic enteritis in veal calves and enteritis in dairy calves was also tested by X 2 analysis (ol = 0.05 ). Three veal calves that were showing typical signs of hemorrhagic disease were necropsied before death by the veterinarian on the farm.",

            "text": "The microbial etiology of the recently described veal calf hemorrhagic enteritis has yet to be identified. However, calf scours is known as a disease complex with multiple etiology. This multiple etiology may include infectious agents, stress factors, lack of a protective level of serum immunoglobulin, and the disturbances of the intestinal microflora. Escherichia coli infection is considered to be the most important disease of young calves (Smith and Halls, 1968; Moon et al., 1978; Morris and Sojka, 1985) . Veal calves are reared on a complete liquid diet such as milk replacers and other feeds that are often supplemented with several antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents at subtherapeutic levels. Such practices were always suspected of selecting for some drug resistant enteric bacterial pathogens by disturbing the intestinal microflora of these young animals. These calves usually originate from a large number of farms and are marketed at approximately 1 week of age (Webster et al., 1985; Visser et al., 1987) . Mixing large numbers of susceptible animals and subjecting them to stress prior to rehousing in intensive systems creates favorable conditions for the spread of infectious agents and the development of disease (Fisher et al., 1975 ) . In this study we have investigated E. coil isolates from veal calves with clinical manifestation of hemorrhagic enteritis (cases) and from dairy calves diagnosed with E. coli enteritis (controls) for the expression of several virulence factors related to pathogenicity. The experimental induction of diarrheal disease in newborn calves using E. coli whole culture (Smith and Halls, 1968 ) and by pure STa has been reported (Saeed et al., 1986) . We have noted that large doses of pure STa can cause hemorrhagic enteritis in challenged calves (Saeed et al., unpublished observations, 1984) . We identified STa production among 45% of the E. coli isolates from veal calves manifesting clinical signs of hemorrhagic enteritis but among only 12% of the dairy calves with non-hemorrhagic diarrhea. Most E. coli strains produce fimbrial adhesive antigens (K99) which attach the pathogen to the intestinal mucosal epithelium (Orskov et al., 1975; Guinee et al., 1977; Smith et al., 1985) . Adherence brings the bacteria into close association with the intestinal villous cells, allowing colonization and facilitating the effect of enterotoxin on the secretory cells. That more E. coli isolates from veal calves than from dairy calves had aggregative attachment suggests that expression of these virulence factors by some strains of E. coli could have a role in the pathogenicity of the disease. In most previously described K99-positive strains of ETEC, a positive correlation between ST~ production and the presence of K99 antigen has been established (Orskov et al., 1975; lsaacson et al., 1978; Moon et al., 1978) . Our results indicate a lack of correlation between these two virulence factors in E. coli isolates from diseased veal calves. It is possible that some virulent ETEC failed to express K99 antigen or that K99-negative virulent ETEC may produce other types of pili which facilitate colonization. Adhesion and colonization by K99-positive ETEC can be blocked by K99 antibody produced by the K99 pilus vaccines which are extensively used in cattle. However, K99 antibodies could lead to the emergence of K99-negative ETEC in vivo (Mainil et al., 1987 ) . The enterotoxigenic aggregative adhering E. coli may be opportunistic organisms in some circumstances. Verotoxin was produced by 22.5% of total and 44% of STa-producing ETEC from veal calves. Verotoxins (which by definition are cytotoxic for vero cells in vitro ) are produced by some E. coli strains such as the hemolytic uremic (O: 157, H:7 ) and other strains that have been identified as playing important roles in human hemolytic uremic syndrome and hemorrhagic colitis. This toxin can be also produced by some Salmonella and Shigella strains in association with a variety of disease conditions (Gonzalez and Blanco, 1985; Karmali et al., 1985; Boppet al., 1987 ) . However, the role of VT in the pathogenesis of veal calf hemorrhagic enteritis is not clearly defined. In this study, VT production in association with ST a could be an important factor in the causation of hemorrhagic enteritis. The importance and prevalence of the aggregative type of attachment ofE. coli should be assessed further. Several combinations of virulence factors could be described among E. coli isolates from this study. This may further expand the nomenclature of E. coli that express multiple virulence attributes. Possible limitations of this study are:",
