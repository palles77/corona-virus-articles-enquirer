As most clinicians and researchers are aware, a wide range of breakthroughs derived from animal studies have saved countless lives. One recent example that is highly relevant to neurology is the development of contemporary immunomodulatory treatments for multiple sclerosis based on preliminary studies in a CNS autoimmune disorder induced experimentally in animals. 4 Continuing identification of innovative therapies using animal models is anticipated in the future as a result of increasingly sophisticated molecular genetic, stem cell, and epigenetic research programs. 5 Animal research continues to be critical for protecting patients from premature approval of potentially deleterious drugs. The tragedy of birth defects caused by thalidomide might have been prevented had more animal research been mandated. Most of the birth defects occurred in Europe, where thalidomide was prescribed to control morning sickness in pregnancy. 5, 6 The United States was largely spared thalidomide-related birth defects due to the vigilance of the US Food and Drug Administration in deferring approval of this drug's use pending investigation of its effects in pregnant animals. 5, 6 Vaccines, which have been the most successful and cost-effective public health intervention ever introduced, have depended on animal research for their development. For example, the polio vaccination program that began 60 years ago could not have been achieved rapidly or safely without animal research. Effective control of more recent infectious disease threats, including Legionnaires' disease, HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and avian flu, have also depended on animal research. Timely response to newly emerging infectious agents (influenza pandemics, hemorrhagic fevers) will also depend on animal research.",

            "text": "Sometimes the misinformation distributed maligns specific researchers. Dr. Sharon Juliano, a researcher at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, has had \"WANTED\" posters placed with her name, picture, and home address, stating \"WANTED FOR MURDER-FOR CRUELTY-FOR DECEIT-FOR CRIMES AGAINST ANIMALS.\" In another harassment strategy, Dr. Juliano's telephone number has been placed in classified ads claiming that she offers condoms as a public service free to callers. 7 Other scientists have had similar experiences. Shortly after Dr. Michael Podell published a major article on feline AIDS, an animal model of human AIDS, he was the target of threatening telephone calls and e-mails encouraged by Internet postings of local and national animal rights groups. 8 After several death threats, he left his funded research project in midstream to undertake private practice veterinary medicine. 8 Dr. Dario Ringach halted his funded vision research after his photograph, home address, telephone number, laboratory address, laboratory telephone number, e-mail, and other contact information were posted on Animal Liberation Front (ALF)-related Web sites, and activists began protesting at his home and distributing inflammatory leaflets to his neighbors. 8 ALF also took credit for delivering a \"Molotov cocktail\" to another researcher, which in error was delivered to an elderly neighbor. Fortunately, it did not detonate. 9 In England, Dr. Colin Blakemore, a vision researcher, received threats regarding the kidnapping of his children as well as bomb threats. 8, 10 Telephone and e-mail harassment, vandalism (broken windows, flooding), home invasion, and firebombing have all been documented as methods of intimidating scientists engaged in animal research. 4 In January 1990, the University of Tennessee received a letter from anti-animal research extremists threatening to assassinate a veterinary dean within 12 months. One month later, the dean of the veterinary school at the University of Tennessee died as a result of a gunshot wound received while on his private farm. His assailant remains unknown. 8, 11 The most threatening acts we have described typically targeted researchers studying primates, cats, or dogs. However, investigators studying rodents increasingly require protection from harassment. 12 University scientists are not the only ones affected. The Chief Executive Officer of Novartis had his mother's ashes stolen, the graves of his family desecrated, and his vacation home burned by animal activists. 13 Activists' efforts to impede transport of research animals (described below) affect a range of stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry. 14,15 \"Animal rights\" groups have attacked other industries. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) was responsible for disrupting the Westminster Dog Show at Madison Square Garden in New York in recent years, 16 and activists have adversely interacted with various stakeholders in the food industry. 17 The centralized activities of the major public organizations are relatively easy to track, but the organizational structure of individuals involved with terrorist acts is considerably more difficult to trace. Activities such as posting personal information or false information about researchers are also difficult to trace and typically are not prosecuted. 3, 5, 8 However, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)'s characterization of these activities as terrorism 17 has assisted efforts toward prosecution. All extremist activities are destructive to scientific dialogue and disruptive to the pipeline of research yielding new therapies for both human and veterinary patients. The Animal Research War by P. Michael Conn and James V. Parker is a thorough resource for additional information regarding this subject. 3, 5, 8, 18, 19 Financial support of the anti-animal research activists.",

Funding for the more \"mainstream\" organizations opposing the use of animals in research can generally be traced. Activists involved in more violent activities are typically from smaller fringe groups not requiring large amounts of funding, and their sources of funding are more difficult to track. PETA is the largest organization against animal research. In fiscal year 2012-2013, PETA was reported to have an annual budget exceeding $35,000,000, 20 mostly from individual donations, with some individual and foundation donations exceeding $1,000,000. 21 These contributions are allocated to fundraising, advertising campaigns, and protests. Despite promoting its efforts in the exploration of alternatives to animal research, only about 2% of the PETA budget is actually allocated toward research into alternatives to animal research. 22 Larger and more public groups have avoided being visibly associated with more aggressive forms of activism, but Internal Revenue Service filings reveal that members of the highly aggressive ALF and the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) are recipients of PETA funds. 18 The FBI has described ALF and ELF as \"the most active criminal extremist elements in the United States.\" 18, 23 As noted above, financial data are not readily available for these affiliated organizations.",

The budgets for the larger, more public organizations, such as PETA, increased over that period. 28 However, the US Department of Justice's recognition of such activities as domestic terrorism 11 may have slowed the rate of increase in such activities in more recent years. The increased regulatory requirements to justify numbers of animals used in research projects have been accompanied by a steady reduction in the numbers of animals of all types used annually for research in the United States, 29 so the increase in anti-animal research activities cannot be attributable to increased use of animals in research.

This act produced large protests in support of biomedical research. 31 Despite threats, the organization continued to grow, finally ending its operations in 2011 after successful construction of the Biomedical Research Facility. 31 More recently, 700 supporters joined University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) researchers who faced harassment from anti-animal research activists to call for an end to the intimidation and threats as part of the UCLA Pro-Test. 32 Current information about how to support animal research and organizations advocating for animal research is available through Americans for Medical Progress at www.raisingvoices.net.

Attacks on animal researchers led to the establishment of Best Practices generated by the Committee on Animals in Research (CAR) of the Society for Neuroscience (SfN). The genesis and motivation for the formation of CAR was the UCLA Task Force's document in response to multiple attacks at their institution (available at the SfN Web site). 33 This document focuses on how universities can best respond to attacks on their scientists and should be presented to the university leadership before an attack occurs. It should be distributed to all universities and research institutions and the plans implemented to preempt attacks and respond to threats. Assistance to members under attack is included in the guidelines. 33 In the future, researchers would be afforded better protection if university leaders provided explicit public affirmation of their support for animal research and adequate resources for security and appropriate law enforcement. Universities should also advocate for legislative protection for the future of research. The role of the university in the protection of researchers is further reviewed by Kordower. 34 The neurologist's response. In response to anti-animal research extremist activities, neurologists and neuroscientists are in an enviable position to be proactive in educating the general public, patients, and students. Educational brochures are available from the AAN to help in this regard. At every opportunity, we should make clear how development of new treatments and breakthroughs are accomplished. We should discuss how unexpected translational breakthroughs often result from basic science research for which no obvious clinical implications were initially apparent. Subsequent research typically involves animals. The public should be made aware that strict rules and regulations already exist to protect the welfare of research animals, prevent mistreatment and undue pain, and ensure optimal care. Every animal study performed at a research institution in the United States is subject to approval by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. This committee requires that the investigator identify alternatives to the use of animals, provide statistical defense of the number of animals needed to perform the studies in order to minimize the number of animals used, and review the procedures to minimize distress and maximize care for the animals. Approval by this committee is also required for funding of grants involving animals by the NIH and most other public and private funding sources that support academic research. The Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care also requires external review of the animal care facilities and their policies and procedures.",
