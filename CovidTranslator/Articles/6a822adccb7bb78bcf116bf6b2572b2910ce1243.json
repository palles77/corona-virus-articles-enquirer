PBCA-Tp5-NP was prepared by nanoprecipitation methods. Dialyzing membrane method was employed to examine the in vitro release of PBCA-Tp5-NP in PBS, and Tp5 samples in the release medium were detected by HPLC. The cell proliferation test ( 3 H-thymidine) was conducted to verify the PBCA-Tp5-NP bioactivity in vitro. The pharmacodynamical studies were performed on preimmunoinhibited rats and in flow cytometer. The size and the entrapment efficiency of PBCA-Tp5-NP were 178 AE 39 nm and 92.21 AE 1.08%, respectively. In vitro release data show that less than 60% Tp5 was released from lyophilized PBCA-Tp5-NP while 80% Tp5 was released from the colloidal PBCA-Tp5-NPs in 48 h. The proliferation test showed that PBCA-Tp5-NP had the similar effect as Tp5. The in vivo data showed that oral PBCA-Tp5-NPs had similar function as what intravenous Tp5 did. The oral bioavailability of Tp5 could be enhanced by PBCA nanoparticles. PBCA-Tp5-NP had the property of sustained-release and the efficacy of Tp5 was not changed after formulation. \u00df",

Then 100 mL of cell suspension above was added into each well and mixed, then kept at 378C, 5% CO 2 for 72 h. 3 H-TdR (1 mCi) was added into each well 14-16 h before the end of culture. Free 3 H-TdR was washed out by distilled water for 20-30 times, and the samples were collected onto the glass microfiber filter and detected by liquid scintillation counter system.
