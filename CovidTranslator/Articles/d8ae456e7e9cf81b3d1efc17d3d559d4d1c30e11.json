It induced the formation of syneytia in primary pig kidney cell cultures, caused hemadsorption and hemagglutination using chicken, turkey, rat and mouse erythrocytes. In growth curve experiments, infectious virus was produced intracellularly starting at 6 hours after inoculation and was followed by rapid release of the virus from the infected cells. The virus contains ribonucleic acid, is ether sensitive and has a size between 100 and 220 nm. At 37 ~ C, the infectivity titer decreased about 2 lOgl0TCIDs0 per 24 hours. The viral population was heterogeneous as indicated by the rate of inactivation by U.V. irradiation and acid pH. Some hemagglutinating activity was left after complete loss of infectivity by ether-, temperature-and U.V. treatment. The VW 572 isolate is antigenically related if not identical to isolates from Canada, U.S.A. and England which were classified as a porcine eoronavirus.",

Direct hemagglutination (i.e. without pretreatment of the virus) and hemadsorption have been described for a human coronavirus, strain OC43 (19, 20) . The host range of agglutinated and adsorbed erythrocytes as well as gradation in sensitivity and optimal temperature for agglutination of tested erythrocytes with the OC 43 strain are similar to the results obtained with the VW572 hemagglutination and hemadsorption experiments. On the other hand, since hemadsorption kept stable after twofold washing of the adsorbing cell sheet, it is thought not to be a \"pseudohemadsorption\", due to accumulation of newly formed virus particles at the external cell surface, as described by B~CK~ALL et al. (4) . The occurrence of hemadsorption may be an indication for an altered structure of the cell membrane, as proposed by ME~'GELING et al. (22) .",

However, no respiratory signs or constipation, as described by ME~GELI~e (23) and CAt~TWt~mltT (5) were observed. The present isolate appeared to be quite virulent for pigs up to one month of age since all inoculated animals, except one, became typically ill. The mortality rate could not be examined in the present work since all pigs were killed for further examination prior to death. From field cases, however, it can be said that practically all affected young pigs eventually die whereas older pigs with clinical signs remain unproductive. The clinical disease described with the VW572 isolate is different from most of the Canadian descriptions of hemagglutinating encephalitis in which acute signs of encephalitis are mainly observed (1, 11) . MITCHELL, however, reported outbreaks in Canada with signs of vomition and wasting in older pigs (26) . During serological examination of several Canadian HEV isolates, G~m et al. (14) found one isolate to be somewhat different from the others. It is, therefore, possible that at least two variants of HEV exist with some difference in pathogenicity pattern.",

At 18 hours, CPE had developed in almost 50 per cent of the monolayer but syneytia had started to fall off the glass. At 24 hours, approximately 50 per cent of the cells had detached.
