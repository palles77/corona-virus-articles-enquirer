In the US, the primary fate of processed sewage sludge (class B biosolids) is application to agricultural land as a soil amendment. To characterize and understand infectious risks associated with land application, and to describe the diversity of viruses in human populations, shotgun viral metagenomics was applied to 10 sewage sludge samples from 5 wastewater treatment plants throughout the continental U.S, each serving between 100,000 and 1,000,000 people. Nearly 330 million DNA sequences were produced and assembled, and annotation resulted in identifying 43 (26 DNA, 17 RNA) different types of human viruses in sewage sludge. Novel insights include the high abundance of newly emerging viruses (e.g. Coronavirus HKU1, Klassevirus, and Cosavirus) the strong representation of respiratory viruses, and the relatively minor abundance and occurrence of Enteroviruses. Viral metagenome sequence annotations were reproducible and independent PCR-based identification of selected viruses suggests that viral metagenomes were a conservative estimate of the true viral occurrence and diversity. These results represent the most complete description of human virus diversity in any wastewater sample to date, provide engineers and environmental scientists with critical information on important viral agents and routes of infection from exposure to wastewater and sewage sludge, and represent a significant leap forward in understanding the pathogen content of class B biosolids.",

Sewage sludge has a high potential for pathogen diversity due to its source of concentrated human waste from thousands to millions of humans, and all known viral pathogens can be excreted by humans in to wastewater collection systems. The ultimate fate of particleassociated viruses contained in raw sewage and secondary wastewater clarifiers is sewage sludge. In the U.S., the majority of biosolids (stabilized sewage sludge) are applied to agricultural land and approximately 75% of these are of class B status 7 . While class B biosolids are known to contain pathogens, the full pathogen content has not been fully described, especially for viruses 8, 9 . The independent identification of viral pathogen diversity in sewage sludge would represent a significant advance in the science of sewage sludge management. More broadly, viral pathogen diversity data can assist in making rational regulatory and treatment design decisions in a variety of environmental scenarios including the assessment of human exposure routes to viruses in wastewater effluents, transport of reclaimed wastewater viruses through the subsurface, wastewater source tracking, and tracking the efficacy of virus removal from a variety of water and wastewater treatment schemes, including point of use devices 10, 11 .",

Even though MG-RAST predicted that over 90% of all sequences coded for proteins, only 19.7% (81,265 contigs) had significant hits to known sequences in the MG RAST database ( Figure 1A ). The failure to annotate contigs demonstrates the limitations of viral diversity (especially for bacteriophages) represented in genome databases. Our experimental efforts to remove contaminating nucleic acids and also the low rRNA gene identifications in MG-RAST annotation ( Figure 1A ) suggest that contamination by non-viral nucleic acids was minimal. The majority of contigs annotated by tBLASTx searches ( Figure 1B) were bacteriophages, followed by non-human eukaryotic viruses. Human pathogens comprised 0.1% of all contigs.",

The N50 sequence length of these human pathogen contigs was 630 bp (Figure S1 inset) . The most abundant potential human pathogen, with the majority of annotated contigs, belonged to the taxonomic family Herpesvirus. Of the other viral pathogen annotations, 32 contigs were identified as DNA viruses of non-Herpesvirus origin (Table S3 ) and 25 contigs were identified as RNA human viral pathogens (Table S4) The relative abundances and occurrence of viral pathogens are presented in Figure 2 . The relative abundance of pathogen-annotated contigs in each specific sample represents the log 10 transformed number of reads within a sample that map to a specific pathogenannotated contig, normalized by the number of sequences in that sample. These values are not quantitative on an absolute (i.e. per mass) basis; thus, reliable estimates of pathogen removal through the digester cannot be performed. Figure 2 results demonstrate that the most abundant and ubiquitous viruses identified by metagenomics were the DNA viruses. Adenovirus, Herpesvirus, Papillomavirus, and Bocavirus were found in more than 90% of the samples. RNA viruses with occurrence greater than 80% of samples were Coronavirus, Klassevirus, and Rotavirus ( Figure 2 ). Relative abundance was linked with occurrence, with the most abundant regions the figure (darkest shade) corresponding to highest occurrence. Variations of up to four orders of magnitude in normalized relative abundance were also observed in pathogen annotations between samples. To observe variations between influent and effluent viral populations for the different locations, viral pathogen populations are presented in a principle coordinate analysis using the Sorensen similarity index (Figure 3 ) 16 . The Sorensen similarity index is a pair-wise measure of sample similarity based on presence-absence data. Using this method of visualization, the normalizing impact of treatment was apparent, as effluent samples grouped with each other and were distinct from the influent samples.",

The occurrence and relative abundance values in this study reveal the gaps in approaches such as using fecal coliforms as an indicator of pathogen content in biosolids. As an example, limitations in the indicator approach can be viewed in a comparison of sample BE versus EE, where fecal coliforms are greater in the EE sample than the BE sample, but occurrence of viruses (Figure 2 ) was 40% for EE versus 75% for the BE sample.",

For all viruses considered in this validation, metagenome sequencing under-represented human viruses compared to PCR. A lower degree of under-representation was associated with the higher relative abundances of human viruses identified through metagenomics, suggesting that these disagreement are likely due to insufficient sequencing depth, which ultimately results in higher method detection limits for human viruses. Adenovirus and Norovirus are notable examples. While PCR measures absolute presence/ absence, regardless of the abundance of non-target nucleic acids such as those from bacteriophages or other sewage-derived viruses, metagenomics measures only a relative abundance, meaning that even in cases when a pathogen has a high absolute abundance, the identification may be obscured by even higher concentrations of other viruses (bacteriophages or non-human eukaryote viruses). Based on the virus extraction efficiency and fraction of eluted RNA or DNA used in the PCR reaction, detection levels were in the range of 1.9\u00d710 3 to 5.7\u00d710 3 genome copies/dry gram. Previously reported concentrations of Enterovirus, Adenovirus, and Norovirus GII genomes in biosolids have averaged 1.4\u00d710 4 , 1.3\u00d710 5 , and 3.2\u00d710 4 genome copies/dry gram, respectively 22 While the detection level is unknown for metagenomic approaches and partially dependent on the amount of sequence information generated (38.7 Gb generated here), the results in Table 2 illustrate that it is most certainly greater than the detection level for that of PCR. The greater sensitivity by PCR highlights the role of metagenomics as a method to reveal overall pathogen diversity, rather than a method to quantify concentration, and suggests that for biosolids, which are rich in bacteriophages and non-pathogenic eukaryote viruses, a greater amount of sequencing data will result in revealing an even larger diversity of human pathogens. The continuing trend of declining DNA sequencing costs should continue to enable and strengthen viral metagenomic approaches for revealing viral diversity 29 .",

Of the more than 10 8 unique viral genotypes estimated to exist in the world 30 , only 4,159 genomes were included in the amended NCBI viral genome database when this study was conducted. Additionally exacerbating this problem, sequenced viral genomes are biased towards those that have a culturable host (bacterial culture or eukaryotic cell line). The vast majority of viruses are unculturable in the laboratory, thus challenging efforts to improve our limited view of viral diversity. While this problem is less severe for human pathogens due to high medical interest and also because genomes are now being produced for viruses that are not culturable (e.g. Klassevirus and Norovirus), there is still likely human pathogen diversity that is not represented in the viral genome database. Large percentages of illnesses are currently undiagnosed. Indeed, efforts to understand the etiological agent in diarrheal and respiratory illness in humans have consistently resulted in no identified agent in more than 40% of cases 27, 31 .",

These results strongly suggest that current regulations for pathogens in sewage sludge that focus on fecal coliform indicators or the presence of Enterovirus, do not capture the full degree of pathogen diversity to which the public may be exposed during biosolids land application. Emerging viruses including Parechovirus, Klassevirus, Bocavirus, and Coronavirus HKU1, were abundantly identified, highlighting previously undemonstrated pathogen diversity in sewage sludge. These identifications demonstrate the need for developing an improved suite of indicator pathogens, and at a minimum, both DNA and RNA viruses, rather than just the RNA virus Enterovirus, must be considered in any future updates to sewage sludge regulation. More broadly, the viral metagenomics approaches applied here are reproducible and are applicable to any environmental sample where viral pathogen diversity may be a concern. However, viral metagenomics should be considered as an approach for revealing diversity, and should act as a basis for, rather than a substitute to, qPCR and culture-based monitoring.",
