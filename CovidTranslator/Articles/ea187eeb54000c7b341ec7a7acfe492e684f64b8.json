Established diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis (TB), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection still proliferate, fueled in part by antimicrobial resistance. 1, 2 The increasing speed and volume of international travel, migration, and trade create new opportunities for microbial spread, and the prospect of a deliberate release of pathogenic microbes underscores the importance of preparedness to address the unexpected. 3 The example of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a previously unknown disease that spread rapidly across countries and continents in 2003, illustrates the vulnerability of the global community to new microbial threats and highlights the need for increased vigilance and strengthened response capacity. 4, 5 The current state of readiness to address new disease agents is outlined in the 2003 Institute of Medicine report, Microbial Threats to Health: Emergence, Detection, and Response. 6 Building on the Institute' s 1992 report, 7 which sought to dispel complacency about the risk of infectious diseases, the new report calls for raised awareness and aggressive global action to address the developments of the intervening decade. These developments include the continued evolution of antimicrobial resistance, the ongoing threat of an influenza pandemic, the increased transborder spread of contagious diseases, the upsurge in infections arising from animal reservoirs, and the threat of intentional biological attacks, as well as the availability of new technologies for diagnosing and preventing disease and for linking public health practitioners around the world.",

To intervene successfully to treat existing infections and prevent the onset of new ones, disease surveillance systems need to provide a continuous, accurate, and near real-time overview of a population' s health. Surveillance systems must be sensitive in terms of their ability to detect outbreaks and other significant changes in community health status over time, and they must be flexible in adapting to changing health intelligence needs. Given the increasing pace of international travel and globalization and the threat of intentional outbreaks, surveillance activities need to extend beyond the monitoring of disease burden to include the capacity to quickly recognize unusual, unexpected, or unexplained disease patterns. Because many emerging infectious agents are zoonotic, it is also important to integrate veterinary disease reporting networks into systems that monitor diseases of humans.",

In the United States, surveillance for notifiable diseases is conducted by state and local health departments, which receive reports from physicians, nurses, and laboratorians who are often the first to observe and report unusual illnesses or syndromes. States voluntarily report nationally notifiable diseases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance (NETSS). To expedite national disease reporting, CDC, in collaboration with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), has developed a standards-based system for collecting and distributing electronic disease reports from local health departments to state and federal public health authorities. The infectious disease surveillance component of this developing Public Health Information Network (PHIN) is the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS). NEDSS is designed to standardize and facilitate the collection of electronic disease information on nationally notifiable diseases within local health jurisdictions directly from healthcare providers to local health authorities. 23 Limited resources have, however, precluded the establishment of a fully integrated health surveillance system that connects health departments and care providers.",

Several provider-based sentinel surveillance networks were established in collaboration with emergency room physicians, infectious disease specialists, and travel medicine specialists to provide early warning of events that might be missed by public health surveillance. Additional enhancements to the surveillance effort include development of the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (PulseNet) as an early warning system for foodborne diseases, support for the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) to monitor antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, strengthened surveillance for diseases of current concern (e.g., West Nile encephalitis), and surveillance for outbreaks that might be due to acts of bioterrorism.",

Outbreak reports are also received from nongovernmental organizations, relief workers, private clinics, individual scientists, and public health practitioners. Additional information is provided by Health Canada' s Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), an electronic tool used by WHO since 1997, which scans Internet news sites for reports of outbreaks and unusual disease events. Global surveillance networks all operate within the framework of the International Health Regulations, which outline WHO' s authority and member states' obligations in reporting and preventing the spread of infectious disease. The International Health Regulations require official reporting of only three diseases: plague, cholera, and yellow fever. 30 Outbreaks of these diseases are reported in WHO' s Weekly Epidemiological Record and electronically through postings on the Internet. Recognizing the limitations of the regulations in the era of emerging and reemerging diseases and spurred by the SARS experiences of 2003, WHO and its member states have undertaken a revision of the document. During the 56th World Health Assembly (WHA), two resolutions were passed, one specific to SARS (WHA56.29) and the other adding impetus to the revision efforts (WHA56.28). The resolutions seek to secure enhanced collaboration with WHO in responding to infectious disease outbreaks. In recognition of the role of animals in the spread of human disease and the potential for infectious disease dissemination due to international travel and trade, the resolution prompted by the SARS experience also urges member states to \"ensure collaboration, when appropriate, with veterinary, agricultural and other relevant agencies involved in animal care and research on, and planning and implementation of, preventive and control measures.\" 31 Whereas the International Health Regulations provide the legal framework for global control of infectious diseases, WHO' s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) is the operational arm, that is, the mechanism by which WHO' s partners respond to outbreaks of international importance. 29 GOARN activities are described in the following section.",

In similar fashion, the Eurosurveillance Project, funded by the European Commission, promotes the diffusion and exchange of information on communicable diseases in Europe. Globally, WHO shares information through the Outbreak Verification List distributed weekly by electronic mail, the WHO Disease Outbreak News on the WHO web site, and the Weekly Epidemiological Record.
