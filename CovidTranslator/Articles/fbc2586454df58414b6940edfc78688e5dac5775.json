They were obtained from patients who were serologically positive for M. pneumoniae infection as well as from patients who were infected with microorganisms that may cause interstitial pneumonia. The following assays were utilized: SeroMP IgM and IgG, SeroMP recombinant IgM, IgA and IgG, Liaison M. pneumoniae IgM and IgG and M. pneumoniae IgM, IgA and IgG ELISA Medac. The SeroMP Recombinant and Liaison assays both showed low IgM specificity, and crossreactivity was mainly observed in groups of patients with acute cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus infections. For IgA, the Medac assay was less specific than the SeroMP Recombinant assay. Discrepancies between the four tests were observed in IgG analyses, and due to the lack of a gold standard, 22 results were removed prior to determining the sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, the overall performance of IgG assays may be overstated; nevertheless, the SeroMP assay demonstrated a lack of sensitivity. The seroprevalence of IgG appears to be very low, raising concerns regarding whether the serological techniques can detect IgG levels over time. Serology remains a biological tool of choice for diagnosing M. pneumoniae infection, but improvement and standardization of the assays are needed, particularly for the determination of IgG.",

It may also be responsible for upper respiratory tract infections and extrapulmonary manifestations. This infection is endemic, with epidemic peaks occurring every 4 to 7 years (B\u00e9b\u00e9ar, 2007) , as was observed in several European countries from 2010 to 2011 (Jacobs, 2012) . Laboratory diagnosis was previously performed with cultures of the organism, but this technique is slow and less sensitive than serological or nucleic acid amplification assays (She et al., 2010) . The nucleic acid amplification assays appear to be the most sensitive methods; however, those techniques cannot distinguish between asymptomatic and acute infections (Dorigo-Zetsma et al., 2001; Foy, 1993; Ieven and Goossens, 1997; Loens et al., 2003) . Serology still has a place of choice in the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection, but this must rely on the analysis of two coupled sera taken at 2-3 weeks. Serological diagnosis can confirm a recent infection when there is an apparition of the IgG or when there is a significant increase in IgG levels between the two sera because upon reinfection, IgM may not be present (Waites and Talkington, 2004) . Complement fixation has been replaced with a variety of commercially available techniques, specifically with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), which allow for a precise quantification of IgM, IgA or IgG (B\u00e9b\u00e9ar, 2007) . The aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of 10 serological assays for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection.",

When the group of non-specific M. pneumoniae IgM was taken into account the specificity of the assays is lower.

The very low seroprevalence of IgG in general is very striking, particularly in patients over the age of 65 (9.09% for SeroMP and 0% for the 3 other assays, obtained from 11 samples from patients over the age of 65). These percentages are far from the 40-50% seroprevalence of IgG in adulthood and 60% over the age of 65, as described by Tuuminen et al. (2000) . These observations raise several questions: (1) are the serological assays able to correctly detect M. pneumoniae IgG in acute phases and over time; (2) are the cut-offs of these assays too high; and (3) are the M. pneumoniae IgG lasting over time?",

For IgM, the SeroMP Recombinant and the Liaison tests obtained lower specificities, and cross-reactivity was mainly observed in sera from acute EBV and CMV infections. For IgA, the SeroMP Recombinant assay appears to be more specific than the Medac assay. The interest in determining IgA levels may be critical to early detection of reinfections because the IgM response may be absent. For IgG tests, the performances were comparable, except for the SeroMP test, which had several false negative results that led to a low sensitivity. However, 22 sera had to be excluded from the IgG results prior to the sensitivity and specificity calculations due to discrepancies between the assays, and thus, the performances may be overstated. These findings implicate the need for improving and standardizing the serological M. pneumoniae assays, particularly for IgG determination. A recent article reports the attempts to develop a blotting technique that improves the performance of the serological assays (Dumke et al., 2012) . ",

The other group that had the highest number of IgM false positive results included patients with acute CMV infections, although this was not observed with all of the assays. The SeroMP assay had only 1 false positive result out of 8 samples that were tested, the Medac assay had 1 false positive result and 1 equivocal result, the SeroMP recombinant test had 5 false positives and 1 equivocal result, and the Liaison test had 6 false positive results. The only serum obtained from a Coronavirus 229E-infected patient showed false positive results for both of the Liaison and SeroMP Recombinant tests, but no conclusion could be drawn from a single sample. In the other groups, false positive results occurred less frequently and often with values close to the cut-off values.",

Cases of M. pneumoniae infections were initially chosen in front of an apparition or a significant augmentation of IgG on paired sera using SeroMP (Savyon Diagnostics, Ashdod, Israel) which was in use for the routine analyses in our laboratory. The serological results of those samples were then compared to those obtained with the other techniques evaluated and finally the group of sera representing the M.",
