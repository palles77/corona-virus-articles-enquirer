            "text": "A biological membrane is semi-permeable, meaning it is permeable to some molecules, most notably water, while being very impermeable to most solutes (various biochemicals and salts) found in the bathing solution. This very important concept of unequal transmembrane distribution and hence permeability between water and other solutes came out of the pioneering work of Charles Overton in the 1890s (see Chapter 2) . How does a biological membrane accomplish semi-permeability? The barrier to solute movement is largely provided by the membrane's hydrophobic core, a very thin (w40 \u00c5 thick), oily layer. The inherent permeability of this core varies from membrane to membrane. Generally, the more tightly packed the lipids comprising the bilayer, the lower its permeability will be. Lipid bilayers are very impermeable to most solutes because of their tight packing. Figure 14 .1 depicts the membrane permeability of a variety of common solutes [1] . Note the data is presented as a log scale of solute permeability (P in cm/s) and ranges from Na \u00fe \u00bc 10 \u00c012 cm/s to water \u00bc 0.2 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 cm/s, spanning almost 10 orders of magnitude! from Na \u00fe (10 \u00c012 cm/s) to water (0.2 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 cm/s). This range spans almost 10 orders of magnitude [1] .",

At temperatures well below T m , the LUVs are in the tightly packed gel state and permeability is extremely low. At temperatures well above T m , the LUVs are in the loosely packed liquid disordered state (l d , also called the liquid crystalline state) and permeability is high. However, maximum permeability is not found in the l d state, but rather at the T m [2] . As the LUVs are heated from the gel state and approach the T m , domains of l d start to form in the gel state. Solutes can then pass more readily through the newly formed l d domains than the gel domains, resulting in an increase in permeability. At T m there is a maximum amount of coexisting gel and l d state domains that exhibit extremely porous domain boundaries. It is through these boundaries that most permeability occurs. As the temperature is further increased, the LUVs pass into the l d state and the boundaries disappear, reducing permeability to that observed for the single component l d state. Thus maximum permeability is observed at the T m .",

Large solutes have low diffusion coefficients and therefore diffuse more slowly than small solutes. The diffusion rate for a particular solute under physiological conditions is a constant and cannot be increased. This defines the theoretical limit for an enzymatic reaction rate and also limits the size of a cell. If a solute starts at the center of a bacterial cell, it takes 10 \u00c03 s to diffuse to the plasma membrane. For this reason, typical cells are microscopic (see Chapter 1). At about 3.3 pounds and the size of a cantaloupe, the largest cell on Earth today is the ostrich egg. However, a dinosaur egg in the American Museum of Natural History in New York is about the size of basketball. Since an egg's only function is to store nutrition for a developing embryo, its size is many orders of magnitude larger than a normal cell.",

INTRODUCTION from high to low potential ( Figure 14. 3) [4] . Osmotic pressure is the force required to prevent water movement across the semi-permeable membrane. Net water movement continues until its potential reaches zero. An early application of the basic principles of osmosis came from the pioneering work on hemolysis of red blood cells by William Hewson in the 1770s (see Chapter 2) . It has also been discussed that MLVs (multilamellar vesicles, liposomes) behave as almost perfect osmometers, swelling in hypotonic solutions and shrinking in hypertonic solutions (see Chapter 3) [5, 6] . Liposome swelling and shrinking can be easily followed by changes in absorbance due to light scattering using a simple spectrophotometer. Therefore, osmosis has been investigated for many years using common and inexpensive methodologies and a lot is known about the process. Membranes are rarely, if ever, perfectly semi-permeable. Deviation from ideality is defined by a reflection coefficient (s). For an ideal semi-permeable membrane where a solute is totally impermeable, s \u00bc 1. If a solute is totally permeable (its permeability is equal to water), s \u00bc 0. Biological membranes are excellent semi-permeable barriers with s \u00bc 0.75 to 1.0.",

Passive diffusion requires no additional energy source other than what is found in the solute's electrochemical (concentration) gradient and results in the solute reaching equilibrium across the membrane. Passive diffusion can be either simple passive diffusion, where the solute crosses the membrane anywhere by simply crossing the lipid bilayer, or facilitated passive diffusion, where the solute crosses the membrane at specific locations where diffusion is assisted by solute-specific facilitators or carriers. Active transport requires additional energy, often in the form of ATP, and results in a nonequilibrium, net accumulation (uptake) of the solute on one side of the membrane. The basic types of membrane transport, simple passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion (by channels and carriers) and active transport are summarized in Figure 14 .4 [8] . There are countless different examples of each type of membrane transport process [7] . Only a few representative examples will be discussed here. FIGURE 14.3 Osmosis and osmotic pressure. Water is placed in a U-shaped tube where each of the tube arms is separated by a semi-permeable membrane with pores of a size that water can easily pass through but a solute cannot. Upon addition of the solute to the tube's right arm, water diffuses from left to right (high water potential to low). The column of water in the tube's right arm (the one containing the solute) rises until the extra weight of the column equals the osmotic pressure caused by the solute. A pump could then be used to counter the osmotic pressure whereupon the solution columns in the right and left arms of the tube are made the same. The pump pressure required to equalize the height of the two columns is the osmotic pressure [4] . Note a small amount of solute leaks from right to left since no filter is perfect.",

This large discrepancy is attributed to the presence of a glucose facilitated diffusion carrier. Figure 14 .6 demonstrates the mode of action of one of these transporters, GLUT-1, from the erythrocyte [10] . GLUTs occur in nearly all cells and are particularly abundant in cells lining the small intestine. GLUTs are but one example in a superfamily of transport facilitators. GLUTs are integral membrane proteins whose membrane-spanning region is composed of 12 a-helices. GLUTs function through a typical membrane transport mechanism [10] .

There are four basic classes of potassium Potassium channels are composed of four protein subunits that can be the same (homotetramer) or closely related (heterotetramer). All potassium channel subunits have a distinctive pore-loop structure that sits at the top of the channel and is responsible for potassium selectivity [12] . This is often referred to as a selectivity or filter loop. The selectivity filter strips the waters of hydration from the potassium ion. Further down the structure is a 10 \u00c5 diameter trans-membrane, water filled central channel that conducts potassium across the membrane. Elucidating the three-dimensional structure of this important integral membrane protein by X-ray crystallography ( Figure 14 .7) [12] was a seminal accomplishment in the field of membrane biophysics. For this work, from 1998, Rod MacKinnon of Rockefeller University ( Figure 14 .8) was awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Until the potassium channel work, just obtaining the structure of non-water soluble proteins was next to impossible. MacKinnon's work not only elucidated the structure of the potassium channel but also its molecular mechanism. It has served as a blueprint for determining the structure of other membrane proteins and has greatly stimulated interest in the field.",

An example of Symport is the SGLT1 (sodium glucose transport protein-1) in the intestinal epithelium [20] . SGLT1 uses the energy in a downhill trans-membrane movement of Na \u00fe to transport glucose across the apical membrane against an uphill glucose gradient so that the sugar can be transported into the bloodstream on the opposite side of the cell.",

Water-soluble enzymes convert substrate to product without any directionality. Mitchell proposed that many enzymes are integral membrane proteins that have a unique trans-membrane orientation. When these enzymes convert substrate to product they do so in one direction. This enzymatic conversion is therefore 'vectorial' or unidirectional. Mitchell expanded this basic concept into his famous chemiosmotic mechanism for ATP synthesis in oxidative phosphorylation [25, 26] . For this idea Mitchell was awarded the 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Vectorial metabolism has been used to describe several membrane transport systems. For example, it has been reported in some cases the uptake of glucose into a cell may be faster if the external source of glucose is sucrose rather than free glucose. Through a vectorial trans-membrane reaction, membrane-bound sucrase may convert external sucrose into internal glucose \u00fe fructose more rapidly than the direct transport of free glucose through its transport system.",

PTS is a multicomponent active transport system that uses the energy of intracellular phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) to take up extracellular sugars in bacteria. Transported sugars may include glucose, mannose, fructose, and cellobiose. Components of the system include both plasma membrane and cytosolic enzymes. Energy to drive the system comes from PEP (DG of hydrolysis is \u00c061.9 KJ/mol). The high energy phosphoryl group is transferred through an enzyme bucket brigade from PEP to glucose producing glucose-6-phosphate (PEP / EI / HPr / EIIA / EIIB / EIIC / glucose-6-phosphate). The sequence is depicted in more detail in Figure 14 .17 [27] . HPr stands for heat-stable protein that carries the high energy~P from EI (enzyme-I) to EIIA. EIIA is specific for glucose and transfers~P to EIIB that sits next to the membrane where it takes glucose from the trans-membrane EIIC and phosphorylates it producing glucose-6-phosphate. Although it is glucose that is being transported across the membrane, it never actually appears inside the cell as free glucose, but rather as glucose-6phosphate. Free glucose could leak back out of the cell, but glucose-6-phosphate is trapped inside, where it can be rapidly metabolized through glycolysis. Group translocation is defined by a transported solute appearing in a different form immediately after crossing the membrane.",

It is a synthetic lipid-soluble proton ionophore that dissipates proton gradients across bioenergetic membranes (mitochondrial inner, thylakoid, bacterial plasma). An uncoupler is therefore an H \u00fe facilitated diffusion carrier. Elucidating the role of DNP in uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation was an essential component in support of Peter Mitchell's Chemiosmotic Hypothesis [25] . Electron movement from NADH or FARH 2 to O 2 via the mitochondrial electron transport system generates a considerable amount of electrical energy that is partially captured as a trans-membrane pH gradient. The movement of H \u00fe s back across the membrane, driven by the electrochemical gradient, is through a channel in the F 1 ATPase (an F-type primary active transport system, see above) that is coupled to ATP synthesis. DNP short-circuits the H \u00fe gradient before it can pass through the F 1 ATPase, thus uncoupling electron transport, the energy source for generating the H \u00fe gradient, from ATP synthesis. Therefore, in the presence of DNP, electron transport continues, even at an accelerated rate, but ATP production is diminished. The energy that should have been converted to chemical energy as ATP is then released as excess heat.",

            "text": "Crown ethers are a family of synthetic ionophores that are generally similar in function to the natural product valinomycin [36] . The first crown ether was synthesized by Charles Pederson (Figure 14 .20) while working at DuPont in 1967. For this work Pedersen was co-awarded the 1987 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Crown ethers are cyclic compounds composed of several ether groups. The most common crown ethers are oligomers of ethylene oxide with repeating units of (eCH 2 CH 2 O-) n where n \u00bc 4 (tetramer), n \u00bc 5 (pentamer) or n \u00bc 6 (hexamer). Crown ethers are given names X-crown-Y, where X is the total number of atoms in the ring and Y is the number of these atoms that are oxygen. The term crown refers to the crown-like shape that the molecule takes. Crown ether oxygens form complexes with specific cations that depend on the number of atoms in the ring. For example, 18-crown-6 has high affinity for K \u00fe , 15-crown-5 for Na \u00fe , and 12-crown-4 for Li \u00fe . The crown ether depicted in Figure 14 .19d is 18-crown-6. Like valinomycin, the exterior of the ring is hydrophobic, allowing crown ethers to dissolve in the membrane lipid bilayer while carrying the sequestered cation. It is now possible to tailor-make crown ethers of different sizes that can encase a variety of phase transfer catalysts. These crown ethers are used to catalyze reactions inside the membrane hydrophobic interior.",

Channel-forming ionophores allow for the rapid facilitated diffusion of various ions that depend on the dimensions of the pore. Nystatin, like other channel-forming ionophores amphotericin B and natamycin, is a commonly used anti-fungal agent. Finding medications that can selectively attack fungi in the presence of normal animal cells presents a difficult challenge since both cell types are eukaryotes. Bacteria, being FIGURE 14.20 Charles Pedersen (1904e1989) . Reprinted with permission. [63] prokaryotes, are sufficiently different from eukaryotes to present a variety of anti-bacterial approaches not amenable to fungi. However, Fungi do have an Achilles Heel. Fungal plasma membranes have as their dominant sterol ergosterol, not the animal sterol cholesterol (see Chapter 5) . Nystatin binds preferentially to ergosterol, thus targeting fungi in the presence of animal cells. When present in sufficient levels, nystatin complexes with ergosterol and forms trans-membrane channels that lead to K \u00fe leakage and death of the fungus. Nystatin is a polyene anti-fungal ionophore that is effective against many molds and yeast including Candida. A major use of nystatin is as a prophylaxis for AIDS patients who are at risk for fungal infections.",

Gap junctions connect the cytoplasms of two adjacent cells through non-selective channels. Connections through adjacent cells are at locations where the gap between cells is only 2e3 nm.

With time, however, the dye was observed to spread to adjacent cells through what appeared to be points on the plasma membrane. These points were later recognized as gap junctions. By varying the size of the fluorescent dye it was shown that there was an upper size limit for dye diffusion.

Six hexagonally arranged connexins are associated with each of the adjacent cell plasma membranes that the gap junction spans.

Each connexin has a diameter of~7nm and the hollow center formed between the six connexins, (the channel), is~3nm in diameter.

Clathrin plays a major role in formation of clathrin coated pits and coated vesicles. Since clathrin was first isolated and named by Barbara Pearse in 1975 [48] , it has become clear that clathrin and other coatproteins play essential roles in cell biology. Clathrin is an essential component in building small vesicles for uptake (endocytosis) and export (exocytosis) of many molecules. While the previously discussed methods of membrane transport involved small solutes, RME is the primary mechanism for the specific internalization of most macromolecules by eukaryotic cells. FIGURE 14.21 Gap junction [43] . Six connexins form a connexon and one connexon from each cell unite to form a gap junction. RME begins with a ligand binding to a specific receptor that spans the plasma membrane ( Figure 14 .22, [49] ). Examples of these ligands include hormones, growth factors, enzymes, serum proteins, LDL (with attached cholesterol), transferrin (with attached iron), antibodies, some viruses, and even bacterial toxins. After receptor binding, the complex diffuses laterally in the plasma membrane until it encounters a specialized patch of membrane called a coated pit. The receptor-ligand complexes accumulate in these patches as do other proteins including clathrin, adaptor protein, and dynamin. Since coated pits occupy~20% of the plasma membrane surface area, they are not minor membrane features. The collection of these proteins starts to curve a section of the membrane that eventually pinches off to form an internalized coated vesicle. Clathrin and dynamin then recycle back to the plasma membrane leaving an uncoated vesicle that is free to fuse with an early endosome. After the early endosomes mature into late endosomes, they then go on to the lysosome for digestion. RME is a very fast process. Invagination and vesicle formation takes~1 min. One single cultured fibloblast cell can produce 2,500 coated pits per minute.",

In humans this process occurs in cells lining the small intestine and is used primarily for absorption of fat droplets. In endocytosis the cell plasma membrane extends and folds around desired extra-cellular material forming a pouch that pinches off creating an internalized vesicle ( Figure 14.24, [52] ). The invaginated pinocytosis vesicles are much smaller than those generated by phagocytosis. The vesicles eventually fuse with the lysosome whereupon the vesicle contents are digested. Pinocytosis involves a considerable investment of cellular energy in the form of ATP and so is many thousand times less efficient than receptormediated endocytosis. Also, in sharp contrast to RME, pinocytosis is non-specific for the substances it accumulates. Pinocytosis is not a recent discovery but was first observed decades before the other transport systems discussed above. Its discovery is attributed to Warren Lewis in 1929. ",

In humans phagocytosis is restricted to specialized cells called phagocytes that include white blood cell neutrophils and macrophages.

In exocytosis intracellular vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and release their aqueous sequestered contents to the outside at the same time that the vesicular membrane hydrophobic components (mostly lipids and proteins) are added to the plasma membrane (Figure 14 .26, [56] ). Steady state composition of the plasma membrane results from a balance between endocytosis and exocytosis. The resultant process of plasma membrane recycling is amazingly fast. For example, pancreatic secretory cells recycle an amount of membrane equal to the whole surface of the cell in~90 min. Even faster are macrophages that can recycle the contents of the plasma membrane in only 30 min.",
