To investigate if mRNA secondary structure improves stability of the complex, we tested a pseudoknot, originating from the genomic RNA of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the positive-stranded coronavirus group. We used the previously-isolated anti-DNA scFv, 3D8, as a target protein. During in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, we observed that incorporation of the pseudoknot into the mRNA resulted in production of a translational intermediate that corresponded to the expected size for ribosomal arrest at the pseudoknot. Complexes containing the mRNA pseudoknot exhibited a higher efficiency of affinity selection than that those without, indicating that the pseudoknot improves stability of the mRNA-ribosome-antibody complex in a eukaryotic translation system. Thus, in order to improve the efficiency of selection, this relatively short pseudoknot sequence could be incorporated into ribosome display.",

This linkage is accomplished by removing the mRNA stop codon, causing the ribosome to stall at the 3\u00a2 end. The ribosome forms a relatively stable complex with the mRNA and translated protein, because in the absence of a stop codon, there is a reduction in the rate at which protein is released [14] . Much research has focused on improving complex stability, as this relates directly to the library diversity and efficiency of ribosome display [15, 16] . In our opinion, the introduction of additional mechanisms for ribosomal pausing during translation might improve complex stability and selection efficiency.",

For in vitro transcription and translation, a T7 promoter and translational start site were added using an upstream primer. The 3D8 scFv DNA was amplified from pIg20 3D8 using the primers HIS3D8/back (5\u00a2-GACCACCATGGACCATCAT CATCATCATCATGAGGTCCAGCTGCAGCAG-3\u00a2) and 3D8/for (5\u00a2-GTTGGTGCAGCATCAGCCCGTTTTATTT CCAGCTTGGTC-3\u00a2). Mouse Cj was prepared as described previously [19] . In brief, RNA was isolated from mouse spleen and Cj DNA was amplified by RT-PCR using the primers Ck/back (5\u00a2-AAACGGGCTGATGCTG CA-3\u00a2) and Ck/for_XmaI (5\u00a2-TCCCCCCGGGCTCTAGA ACACTCATTCCTGTTGGAGCT-3\u00a2). 3D8/for and Ck/ back were designed with identical sequences corresponding to scFv at the 3' end and spacer DNA at the 5' end, enabling the two fragments to be linked by PCR and ligated into pUC18. To investigate the effects of a pseudoknot on ribosome display, p3D8PK and p3D8g3, containing the pseudoknot and gene III, respectively, were prepared from pRD3D8 as presented schematically in Fig. 1A . The gene III spacer region was amplified from pCANTAB5E (GE Healthcare BioSciences, Piscataway, NJ). The pseudoknotcontaining spacer region was amplified using the primers PK/back (5\u00a2-TCCCCCCGGGCGGGGTATCAGTCAGG CTCGGCTGGTACCCCTTGCAAAGCGAGCCTTCCT-CAACCTCCTGTCAATG-3\u00a2) and g3p/for (5\u00a2-ATACCCA AGCTTTATCACCAGTAGCACC-3\u00a2). This similarly-sized control spacer was amplified using the primers g3/back (5\u00a2-TCCCCCCGGGAGGATCCATTCGTTTGTG-3\u00a2) and g3p/ for.

The mRNA was prepared by in vitro transcription, and then translated in an RRL system. To detect pausing, translation reactions were harvested every 2.5 min and the reaction mixtures subjected to SDS-PAGE. Translated proteins were observed using autoradiography. In comparison to p3D8g3 (control), we observed that p3D8pk mRNA produced a translational intermediate of ca. 45 kDa (Fig. 3) . As with a previous study [18] , this was a paused intermediate and not a deadend product. The intermediate was detected initially at 10 min and could be observed clearly at 15 min. The fully translated protein (ca. 60 kDa) was detected at 12.5 min and increased in abundance over time (Fig. 3A) . No translational intermediate was detected from p3D8g3 mRNA, which does not contain a pseudoknot (Fig. 3B ).",

Since we had observed translational pausing at between 10 and 20 min in p3D8pk, the mRNA was translated for the same time periods. After affinity selection, mRNA was isolated from bound ribosomal complexes and reverse transcribed. Comparison of the resulting PCR bands indicated that irrespective of time, the band derived from the pseudoknotcontaining construct was more abundant than that from the gene III-containing construct (Fig. 5 ). This suggests that pausing induced by the pseudoknot increases the efficiency of ribosome display. ",

            "text": "In vitro display techniques are potentially more advantageous than in vivo display. Very large libraries can be conveniently handled and proteins can be made to evolve through the iteration of random mutagenesis and selection with considerable ease [21] . Two methods of in vitro display, mRNA-protein fusion and ribosome display, are generally used and both allow the complete in vitro synthesis and selection of proteins. The most significant difference between these methods is the way in which the protein is linked to mRNA. mRNA-protein fusions link mRNA and protein by a covalent bond through the use of a small adaptor molecule, typically puromycin [22] [23] [24] [25] . In the initial description of this strategy, a complex enzymatic step requiring ligation of puromycin to the mRNA led to low yields of the mRNA-protein fusion [24, 25] . Improved fusion synthesis was achieved though continued efforts to simplify the preparation of the mRNA-protein fusion [26, 27] . In ribosome display, the absence of a stop codon causes ribosomes to stall on the mRNA. As it is difficult to represent the complete diversity of all translated mRNAs using this method, research has focused on improving the stability of the ribosome-mRNA-protein complex. In order to induce ribosome stalling, Zhou et al. [15] introduced the ricin A subunit (RTA) and observed that the stalled complex remained relatively stable even at room temperature. In the prokaryotic ribosome display system [5, 12] , the stem-loop segments from T7 gene 10 and E. coli lipoprotein genes have been introduced at the 5\u00a2-and 3\u00a2-ends of mRNA. However, secondary structure has not been applied to eukaryotic ribosome display systems, and so we investigated the applicability of incorporating a pseudoknot for increasing stability of the complex.",

In our construct (V H /K-pseudoknot-spacer), ribosomal arrest was observed at the pseudoknot sequence and although there was no significant difference between the binding of the two constructs, the pseudoknot-containing construct showed an increased efficiency of affinity selection. Thus, ribosomal pausing induced by the pseudoknot affects stability of the antibodyribosome-mRNA complex. Although the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of purified 3D8 scFv is 17-74 nM [20] , we observed a lower than predicted level of translated protein binding. This suggests a lower abundance of translated protein, since the translational time was short and ribosomal recycling was limited by the pseudoknot and absence of a stop codon.",
