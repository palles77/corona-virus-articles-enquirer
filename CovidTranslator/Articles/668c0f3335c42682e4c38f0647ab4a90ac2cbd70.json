From November 2002 to July 2003 the cumulative number of worldwide cases was >8000, with a mortality rate of close to 10%. The mortality has been higher in older patients and those with co-morbidities. SARS has been defined using clinical and epidemiological criteria and cases are considered laboratory-confirmed if SARS coronavirus is isolated, if antibody to SARS coronavirus is detected, or a polymerase chain reaction test by appropriate criteria is positive. At the time of writing (24 May 2004), no specific therapy has been recommended. A variety of treatments have been attempted, but there are no controlled data. Most patients have been treated throughout the illness with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, and other supportive measures. Transmission of SARS is facilitated by close contact with patients with symptomatic infection. The majority of cases have been reported among healthcare providers and family members of SARS patients. Since SARS-CoV is contagious, measures for prevention center on avoidance of exposure, and infection control strategies for suspected cases and contacts. This includes standard precautions (hand hygiene), contact precautions (gowns, goggles, gloves) and airborne precautions (negative pressure rooms and high efficiency masks). In light of reports of new cases identified during the winter of 2003-4 in China, it seems possible that SARS will be an important cause of pneumonia in the future, and the screening of outpatients at risk for SARS may become part of the pneumonia evaluation.",

Another series of 72 cases in Hong Kong showed that despite significantly high dosages of corticosteroid therapy, a seroconversion of 95.8% occurred on day 21 after onset of illness. [35] This differs from the US experience where of the 74 probable cases of SARS reported by 15 July 2003, only 8 had been confirmed by laboratory diagnosis (all by serology); 38 were negative and 28 had no result. b Antibody testing should also be carried out on a serum sample collected >28 days after symptom onset. antibody titer when tested in parallel should be considered indicative of a confirmed case. A variety of methods for detection of coronavirus infection are now available. These include culture methods, PCR-based methods, and serological tests. [31] Culture of the SARS coronavirus is considered solid evidence of infection, but there have been problems with the various generations of RT-PCR assays, both with false-positive results and with inconsistent detection of viral genome in the first days of illness as well as later in the convalescent phase. It is therefore recommended that detection of SARS-CoV RNA by RT-PCR be validated by a second reference laboratory. [32] Because antibodies to SARS coronavirus have not been found in the general population, background SARS coronavirus antibodies do not appear to be a substantial concern. However, the current serologic assays (both ELISA and IFA [indirect fluorescent antibody] formats) do not reliably detect antibodies until the titers rise substantially after the second week of illness. According to the USCDC, suspect or probable cases are considered laboratory-confirmed if SARS coronavirus is isolated, if antibody to SARS coronavirus is detected and confirmed by a second reference laboratory, or if two Table IV .
