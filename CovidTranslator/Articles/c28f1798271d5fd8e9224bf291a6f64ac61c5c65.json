Using a combination of ectopic expression and gene silencing approaches in cell culture, we previously identified Ifi27l2a as a candidate antiviral ISG within neuronal subsets of the central nervous system (CNS) that restricts infection by West Nile virus (WNV), an encephalitic flavivirus of global concern. To investigate the physiological relevance of Ifi27l2a in the context of viral infection, we generated Ifi27l2a \u060a/\u060a mice. Although adult mice lacking Ifi27l2a were more vulnerable to lethal WNV infection, the viral burden was greater only within the CNS, particularly in the brain stem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Within neurons of the cerebellum and brain stem, in the context of WNV infection, a deficiency of Ifi27l2a was associated with less cell death, which likely contributed to sustained viral replication and higher titers in these re-",

WNV and related flaviviruses typically are transmitted by arthropod vectors and include members that cause encephalitis (e.g., Japanese encephalitis virus [JEV] , Saint Louis encephalitis virus [SLEV] , and tick-borne encephalitis virus [TBEV] ) or systemic and/or visceral disease (e.g., dengue virus [DENV] and yellow fever virus [YFV] ). WNV transmission occurs between Culex species mosquitoes and selected avian hosts, with incidental, dead-end infection of horses, humans, and other vertebrate animals. Humans can develop severe disease following WNV infection, as the virus can invade the central nervous system (CNS) and cause flaccid paralysis, meningitis, or encephalitis, often leading to long-term neurological sequelae or death (1) . In the CNS, WNV replicates principally in neurons, and infection may lead to focal lesions, cell injury, and cell death within the brain and spinal cord (2) (3) (4) . Factors governing WNV entry into and replication within the CNS are complex and include the age of the host, the genetic background (5) (6) (7) (8) , the quality of the immune response, and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (for reviews, see references [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

            "text": "In response to viral infections, most mammalian cells secrete type I interferon (IFN), which promotes an antiviral state in an autocrine and paracrine manner by inducing expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The gene signature and inhibitory activity promoted by type I IFNs vary depending on the cell type, specific viral pathogen, and possible pathogen-induced immune evasion mechanisms. Within the CNS, the innate immune response must balance the need to restrict virus infection while simultaneously protecting nonrenewable neurons. Indeed, selected regions of the brain and CNS have evolved distinct antiviral programs and mechanisms to restrict infection by different RNA and DNA viruses (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . Neurons derived from the cerebral cortex are more permissive of infection by multiple viruses, with IFN-\u2424 pretreatment reducing infection of several viruses only minimally (14) . In comparison, granule cell neurons (GCN) derived from the cerebellum are less permissive of viral infection at the baseline state and produce a stronger antiviral response following IFN-\u2424 pretreatment. Microarray analysis revealed differences in the basal and induced expression of ISGs in GCN compared to cortical neurons (CN) (14) . As an example, Ifi27l2a is an ISG expressed at higher levels in GCN than in CN under basal conditions, after IFN-\u2424 pretreatment, or following WNV infection. Ectopic expression of Ifi27l2a in CN suppressed infection of a neurotropic flavivirus (WNV) and coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus [MHV]) but not an alphavirus (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus [VEEV] ). Reciprocally, gene silencing of Ifi27l2a in GCN resulted in enhanced WNV infection (14) .",

Although Ifi27l2a is induced broadly in peripheral organs after IFN stimulation, it is expressed in selected regions in the brain during development in an age-dependent manner (29) , with high levels within the hippocampus (30) .

In contrast, ectopic expression of human IFI27 inhibited HCV and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection in hepatocellular carcinoma cells; reciprocally, gene silencing of IFI27 resulted in increased HCV and NDV infection (28, 34) .

Following in vivo infection with WNV, Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice exhibited increased mortality and higher viral burden in the cerebellum, brain stem, and spinal cord. The enhanced viral burden in the cerebellum and brain stem of Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice was associated with lower levels of neuron death at early stages of CNS infection.

The Ifi27l2a ISG is differentially upregulated in selected neurons of the brain after WNV infection, and ectopic expression of Ifi27l2a in cultured cortical neurons inhibited infection by WNV (14) . To explore an antiviral role for this relatively poorly characterized ISG in vivo, we generated Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice using a targeted gene deletion strategy (Fig. 1A) ; deletion of Ifi27l2a was validated by PCR (Fig. 1B) . In WT mice, basal Ifi27l2a mRNA expression was observed in lymph node, heart, lung, and testes and, to a lesser extent, in the kidney and spleen. Following WNV infection, Ifi27l2a mRNA expression was induced in the brain and spinal cord (Fig. 1C) . To quantify Ifi27l2a mRNA expression in response to viral infection, we analyzed selected tissues at successive time points following peripheral inoculation (Fig. 1D) . At 4 and 8 days postinfection, Ifi27l2a mRNA expression was enhanced in the brain (2.0-fold and 3.3-fold, respectively; P \u03fd 0.005) and the spinal cord (2.1-fold and 2.0-fold, respectively; P \u03fd 0.005). Within the spleen, 12-fold-higher levels of Ifi27l2a mRNA were observed 4 days after infection (P \u03fd 0.05). We also analyzed Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea and wild-type (WT) mice for possible differences in immune cell subsets in the spleen and blood. Although the numbers of CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells and CD19 \u03e9 B cells were similar, Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice had slightly greater numbers of splenic NK cells (NK1.1 \u03e9 ) than WT mice (Table 1) ; while noteworthy, this phenotype may be less important in the context of WNV infection, as NK cell depletion does not impact WNV pathogenesis in mice (12, 53) .

After subcutaneous infection with 10 2 PFU of WNV-NY, Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice exhibited a decreased survival rate compared to WT animals (29% versus 63%, P \u03fd 0.05), although the mean times to death in the two groups were similar ( Fig. 2A) . WNV burden in the CNS of Ifi27l2a \u060a/\u060a mice. To understand why an absence of Ifi27l2a resulted in enhanced pathogenicity of WNV-NY, viral burden was examined at different days (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 14) in serum, peripheral organs (spleen and kidney), and CNS tissues (brain and spinal cord). Levels of WNV viremia in WT and Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice at days 2, 4, and 6 were similar (Fig. 2B) . At all time points tested, levels of viral burden in the spleen of WT and Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice were also similar (Fig. 2C) . Moreover, a deficiency in Ifi27l2a did not result in productive infection of the kidney (Fig. 2D) , an organ that is typically resistant to WNV-NY infection in WT mice and yet is permissive in animals with defects in type I IFN induction, signaling, or effector functions (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) . However, within the CNS at day 8 after infection, the WNV-NY burden increased in the brain (2.4-fold increase, P \u03fd 0.05) and spinal cord (170-fold increase, P \u03fd 0.005) of Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice ( Fig.  2E and F) . This difference in viral titer was not apparent at later time points, and by day 14, infectious virus was not detectable within the CNS or peripheral tissues in surviving animals of both genotypes, suggesting that Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea animals did not have a defect in the clearance phase of WNV, which requires CD8 \u03e9 effector T cells (36) .",

Unexpectedly, following intracranial inoculation of WNV-NY into the cerebral cortex, we observed no differences in viral titers within different regions of the CNS at either 3 or 5 days after infection (Fig. 3A to F) . Because the WNV-NY strain is highly virulent, we repeated intracranial infection studies with the attenuated WNV Madagascar strain (WNV-MAD), which is more sensitive to the antiviral effects of type I IFN (14, 37, 59) . We observed a modest (17-fold, P \u03fd 0.05) and yet statistically significant phenotype, with greater WNV-MAD infection at day 3 after infection in the brain stem of Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice (Fig. 3G to L).

Given that the virologic phenotype occurred in selected brain regions of Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice, we investigated whether Ifi27l2a had differential antiviral activity in different neuron populations. We prepared primary neurons from the cerebral cortex (CN) and cerebellum (GCN) of WT and Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice, pretreated cells with IFN-\u2424, and measured viral growth kinetics after infection with WNV-NY. We detected no differences in replication kinetics in CN, with only mild suppression of infection with IFN-\u2424 pretreatment (Fig. 8A) , as seen previously (14) . Somewhat unexpectedly, we observed similar viral growth kinetics in GCN from WT and Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice for WNV-NY, with replication being suppressed to a greater degree following IFN-\u2424 pretreatment (Fig. 8B) , also as reported previously (14) . We reassessed viral growth kinetics with the more IFN-sensitive strain, WNV-MAD. Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea GCN supported higher levels of WNV-MAD infection; this effect was more pronounced when cells were pretreated with IFN-\u2424 (18-fold, P \u03fd 0.05) (Fig. 8C) , and a difference in viral replication (55-fold) was present in non-IFN-\u2424-treated cells. Consistent with these data, by 72 h after infection, a greater proportion of WNV-MAD-infected GCN was observed in Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea than in WT GCN (Fig. 8D ). Because we observed differences in WNV restriction in WT and Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea GCN, we considered whether a deficiency of Ifi27l2a altered the general ISG response in GCN. We treated cells with known ISG inducers [IFN-\u2424, poly(I\u00b7C), WNV-NY, and WNV-MAD] and assessed expression of Oas1a and Ifit1 mRNA. As Oas1a and Ifit1 induction levels were similar in WT and Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea GCN ( Fig. 8E and F) , a deficiency of Ifi27l2a did not broadly impact expression of other antiviral ISGs.",

Because neurons are largely nonrenewable, it is imperative that the host clears viral infection while protecting cells from direct or collateral immune-mediated damage. We previously identified Ifi27l2a as a putative inhibitory ISG that was expressed preferentially within neurons of the cerebellum compared to those from the cerebral cortex (14) . Here, we established a protective antiviral role for Ifi27l2a in vivo against WNV. Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice were more susceptible to WNV-induced mortality and sustained higher viral titers in the cerebellum, brain stem, and spinal cord. Remarkably, at day 9 after infection, Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice had less cell death in neurons of the cerebellum and brain stem. Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice showed no apparent defects in their ability to generate a peripheral or CNS cellular immune response, and levels of WNV replication were equivalent in several other cell types that lacked or expressed Ifi27l2a. Several members of the Ifi27 family have been studied in the context of viral infections. Many viruses, including influenza A virus, Sindbis virus, WNV, JEV, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1, induce expression of Ifi27 family members (14, 29, (62) (63) (64) . Our prior study reported that ectopic expression of Ifi27l2a in CN reduced WNV infection whereas small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing in GCN resulted in enhanced viral replication (14) . Work by others has shown that ectopic expression of human IFI27 (ISG12A) inhibited replication of HCV in Huh-7.5 cells and that, reciprocally, siRNA-mediated silencing of human IFI27 enhanced HCV replication (28) . High levels of expression of human IFI27 also inhibited Newcastle disease virus (NDV) replication and oncolytic activity in Huh7 cells (34) .",

            "text": "The unique cell type expression, subcellular localization, and induction patterns of Ifi27 family genes suggest possible modular functions. Humans have four IFI27 members, of which only IFI27 and IFI6-16 (IFI6) are IFN inducible. Mice have three gene paralogs, Ifi27 (Ifi27l1), Ifi27l2a, and Ifi27l2b, all of which are IFN inducible, with Ifi27l2a exhibiting the greatest induction after type I IFN treatment (19) . IFI27 family members have been suggested to localize to the mitochondria (21, 22) or to the nuclear membrane (23, 24) ; in the latter case, IFI27 interacts with and sequesters the NR4A1 nuclear receptor, which regulates expression of anti-inflammatory genes (24) . IFI27 family members also appear to have proapoptotic effects (21, 32, 34, 65, 66) , possibly as a result of stabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and regulation of caspase activity (21, 65) . Perhaps because of these proposed pleotropic activities, IFI27 family members have been associated with overexpression in certain cancers (66, 67) , promotion of skin keratinocyte replication (68) , and DNA damage-induced apoptosis and cytochrome c release (21) . IFI6-16 (IFI6) is an ISG12 motifcontaining family member that may share some functions with Ifi27l2a. In the context of DENV infection, a deficiency of IFI6-16 was associated with increased caspase levels and decreased Bcl-2 expression and mitochondrial membrane stabilization (65) . Additionally, ectopic expression of IFI6-16 has been shown to suppress infection of YFV (69) . Our in vivo data are most consistent with a model in which Ifi27l2a expression is induced by type I IFN in response to WNV infection and (for reasons that remain uncertain) promotes cell death in a cell-type-specific manner. In its absence (in Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice), subsets of virally infected neurons (e.g., in the cerebellum, brain stem, and possibly spinal cord) live longer, which allows greater yields of virus to accumulate, at least during the early phase of CNS infection. We speculate that the increased rate of death of WNV-infected Ifi27l2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice is ultimately caused by virus-induced injury of neurons in regions of the CNS that control key or autonomic function. The results of our study, along with the work of others, suggest multiple possible functions for different Ifi27 family members, with some of the antiviral properties being linked to cell death phenotypes in infected cells.",

Analogously, preferential antiviral roles in the CNS for other ISGs (Ifit2 and Rsad2 [viperin]) have been reported. In Ifit2 \u03ea/\u03ea mice, higher WNV and VSV titers were observed in the olfactory bulb, brain stem, and cerebellum (13, 70) . In Rsad2 \u03ea/\u03ea mice, an increase in WNV infection was observed in the cerebral cortex, white matter, and spinal cord (54) . We observed differences in the regional restriction of WNV in the CNS mostly in the context of peripheral viral but not intracranial infection, with the exception of the brain stem. Viral infection of peripheral immune tissues (e.g., lymph node or spleen) may induce systemic accumulation of type I IFN that primes the antiviral response in the brain either earlier or prior to viral entry into the CNS, whereas direct administration of virus to the CNS may permit rapid replication of WNV in neurons in the context of a less robust type I IFN response. Although future studies are needed to determine why region-specific antiviral effects of individual ISGs occur, we speculate that these genes do not function in isolation, and partner proteins that are expressed differentially may regulate their activity. While our findings suggest an antiviral function within select neurons and M, the precise cellular mechanism of action of Ifi27l2a warrants further investigation.",

Genotyping was verified with a positive-control plasmid containing wild-type Ifi27l2a and negative controls with a null plasmid control. (B) Ifi27l2a deletion was confirmed by the presence of a 408-bp band (KO, knockout), whereas WT Ifi27l2a manifested as a 612-bp band. (C) The Ifi27l2a RT-PCR product was screened for in brain, spinal cord (SC), lymph node (LN), spleen, kidney, lung, liver, white fat (adipose), and testes. Selected mice were infected subcutaneously with WNV-NY, and tissues were collected 4 days after infection and compared to those of mock-infected animals. The results are representative of 2 to 3 mice per treatment group. (D) Following peripheral infection by WNV-NY, selected tissues were collected at 4 and 8 days after infection and expression of Ifi27l2a mRNA was compared to the results seen with mock-infected animals. Ifi27l2a mRNA was measured in brain, spinal cord, spleen, and lymph node and was normalized to the GAPDH gene by qRT-PCR.
