In the ED, the patient was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 57/39 mm Hg, pulse 57 beats/min, respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. ECG was suggestive of non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. Chest radiograph showed bilateral pneumonia and congestive heart failure with marked cardiomegaly. Her laboratory abnormalities included an increased WBC count of 13.4 cells/mm 3 , mild anemia with a hematocrit level of 34%, a mildly increased creatinine level at 1.8 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase level of 36 units/L and aspartate aminotransferase level of 160 units/L, and markedly increased troponin and creatinine kinase levels of 29.43 ng/mL and 653 IU/L, respectively. The patient went into respiratory arrest, was subsequently tracheally intubated, began receiving low-dose dopamine, and was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and presumed sepsis. A chest computed tomography scan showed complete atelectasis of the right middle lobe, bilateral ground-glass opacities of the upper lobes, and bilateral pleural effusions. A subsequent bronchoscopy identified a large cauliflower-shaped mass in the right lower lobe airway. Multiple blood, urine, and sputum cultures were unrevealing; rapid antigen test was positive for influenza A, with subsequent confirmation novel influenza A (H1N1) at the CDPH VRDL. The patient remains hospitalized in critical condition under intensive care.",

These results indicate that seasonal influenza viruses continue to circulate throughout California and might be a cause of influenza-like illness and positive results from rapid antigen tests. Although rapid antigen test results were positive in 67% of tested cases in this series, anecdotal reports from other cases confirmed at the CDPH VRDL, tested mostly in the outpatient setting, suggest that false-positive and -negative results are common. Accordingly, the CDPH has emphasized the importance of testing influenza viruses in the state with rRT-PCR. The CDPH also has advised clinicians in California to collect respiratory specimens for rRT-PCR testing, subtyping, and further characterization at public health laboratories from patients who are hospitalized or who die with febrile respiratory illness.",

On June 11, 2009, less than 1 month after the release of this first report of hospitalized patients with novel influenza A (H1N1), the World Health Organization declared an influenza pandemic, urging the health care community to implement appropriate measures to help prevent a repeat of the deadly 1918 pandemic, which caused more than 50 million deaths. Although most cases observed during the current outbreak appear to be relatively mild (as of July 11, 2009 , there were approximately 37,000 US cases, with slightly more than 200 deaths), serious complications have occurred and the pandemic remains in flux. Emergency physicians will play a pivotal role in the care of patients during this infectious disease outbreak and accordingly need to be armed with guidance to reduce morbidity and mortality and decrease likelihood of disease transmission. Key ED management issues include triage and isolation, diagnostic testing, and disposition. This discussion addresses these issues, which have also been the focus of recent guidance from American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) leadership. 1,2",

Airborne transmission, ie, dissemination of small droplet nuclei or particles occurring over longer distances, is also believed to occur, but this mode remains controversial and is likely far less frequent. 5 Limited data are available about transmission modes for novel influenza A (H1N1), but the CDC and others report that patterns are likely similar to those of seasonal influenza but with higher transmissibility. 6, 7 Resources recently created and regularly updated by the CDC and ACEP have been made available to guide clinical decisionmaking. 2, 8 Droplet precautions are advised for any patient presenting with \"symptoms of an acute respiratory infection.\" 2 For waiting room patients, this means physical separation of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, with distribution of surgical masks for those with active respiratory symptoms. 2 Alternative temporary open-air waiting areas (eg, tents) are advised according to ED capacity. The triage process should include specific criteria to identify suspected cases among individuals with influenza-like illness, ie, temperature greater or equal to 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F) plus cough or sore throat in the absence of a known cause other than influenza. Suspected cases are then identified as any patient with influenza-like illness who has had contact with anyone with a confirmed case, travel to a region with greater than 1 confirmed case, or residence in a community with greater than 1 confirmed case. Although early in the outbreak the CDC recommended airborne precautions with N95 mask use for health care workers caring for those with suspected or confirmed cases, guidelines have since evolved. The most recent ACEP and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) recommendations advise droplet precautions only, with the following exceptions: for patients requiring supplemental oxygen, add private room with closed door, and in instances in which respiratory procedures are being performed (ie, intubation, nebulizer treatment, suction, sputum induction), patients should be placed in an airborne isolation room. 2 Notably, a recent Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report found that a significant proportion of health care worker-acquired cases of novel influenza A (H1N1) infections occurred among those with inconsistent use of personal protective equipment. 9 The most common breaches were failure to adhere to eye protection, followed by failure to adhere to use of surgical or N95 masks.",

An important limitation of rapid tests is their inability to distinguish between seasonal and novel influenza A (H1N1) viruses.

At this point, there are insufficient data to reliably determine precisely who is at greatest risk for complications. 13, 14 Both the CDC and ACEP thus suggest that risk-stratification decisions for novel influenza A (H1N1) be based on the same age and risk categories used for seasonal influenza. Younger children, older adults, immunocompromised individuals, nursing home patients, pregnant women, and those with chronic underlying diseases are considered at increased risk. 2 Although this early report suggests that most patients infected with novel influenza A (H1N1) in the United States have recovered quickly, with relatively short lengths of stay (median 2.5 days for those without underlying conditions), some prolonged hospitalizations and complications were observed. Not surprisingly, the majority occurred in those with chronic underlying conditions (see the table in the full CDC text for details). 10 Several recent reports implicate that pregnancy and obesity are associated with increased risk of complications. 15, 16 A surprising dearth of clinical prediction rules exist to aid disposition decisionmaking for those with seasonal influenza, with the exception of one that has been validated for adult patients older than 65 years. 17 In that study, risk factors for hospitalization or death included increasing age, male sex, previous-year hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza, increased number of outpatient visits, and presence of pulmonary disease, cardiac disease, renal disease, dementia, stroke, or cancer. In a recent pilot study, we used influenza viral load as a surrogate to predict hospital length of stay. 18 Future work is required to develop and validate clinical or biomarker prediction guidance for the novel influenza A (H1N1) infection. For now, emergency physicians should remain alert to ongoing clinical and epidemiologic data, local regulations, and the most up-to-date guidance from both the CDC and ACEP. ",
