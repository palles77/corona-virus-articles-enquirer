The correct sequence of the bases cytosine (C), thymine (T), adenine (A), and guanine (G) in the gene-containing regions of DNA had been elucidated with an accuracy of 99.99% for 99% of the euchromatin. This is considered to be the most that can be achieved with current technology, and all that now remains is to sequence the remaining regions, which are more difficult because they include almost 400 highly repetitive DNA fragments in addition to the centromeres, the structures that divide chromosomes.",

Around the same time, the public consortium known as the Human Genome Project was formed, and this organization announced a 15-year plan (from 1990 to 2005) with the following objectives: a) to determine the complete nucleotide sequence of human DNA and identify all the genes in human DNA (estimated to number between 50 000 and 100 000); b) to build physical and genetic maps; c) to analyze the genomes of selected organisms used in research as model systems (eg, the mouse); d) to develop new technologies; and e) to analyze and debate the ethical and legal implications for individuals and for society as a whole.",

The strategy adopted by the HGP was to sequence the DNA whose location on the chromosomes was already known. 3 However, this strategy was challenged in 1998 by J. Craig Venter and his team, who had just set up a private company called Celera Genomics. Taking advantage of recent advances in technology, this team proposed an alternative strategy based on cutting the genome into small segments and using a computer to reassemble the sequences by matching the overlapping ends of each fragment. With these innovations, this private consortium announced that they would sequence the human genome in 3 years, in other words, that they would complete the task by 2001. This undoubtedly brought immense pressure to bear on the public group, the HGP, headed since 1992 by Francis S. Collins, and also gave rise to fears that a private company might control a large part of the human genome through patents. After several unsuccessful attempts to get the private and public sector groups to collaborate, an agreement was reached to simultaneously publish a first draft of the human genome in February, 2001. This draft did not, however, have the degree of precision of the current one. Consequently, the HGP Consortium published its results in Nature 4 in February 2001, and Celera did likewise in Science. 5 The sequences were subsequently corroborated with a greater degree of reliability, and in April 2003, with the sequence practically complete, the HGP Consortium declared the task to be completed. 6, 7 Discoveries and Surprises",

However, the sequencing of the genomes of other organisms has yielded unexpected results. For example, the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has approximately 13 500 genes, fewer than other simpler organisms, such as the earth worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, with 18 500 genes, and the mustard plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, with around 28000. 8-10 Therefore, the human genome only has around 2000 more genes than Arabidopsis despite its obviously greater biological complexity.",

The DNA in the genes has coding regions, called exons, interrupted by long noncoding sequences, called introns (intergenic regions). These noncoding regions are removed by the process of splicing in the formation of messenger RNA, so that the resulting messenger RNA is much shorter than the original DNA from which it was produced. For example, it has been reported that around 54% to 59% of genes in human chromosomes 14 and 22 undergo alternative splicing-the exons combine in different ways and produce various different proteins. 4, 5 This means that the number and variety of proteins in an organism does not depend solely on the number of genes in the genome, but rather on the way these genes are used.",

As a result, sequences identical to those of the X chromosome that permit recombination between the two chromosomes in those regions only exist today in the terminal regions of the Y chromosome. However, over 95% of the modern Y chromosome has specific regions with no equivalents on another chromosome that would enable recombination during sperm production, and this is a rare example of persistence in the absence of sexual recombination. These regions contain genes that specifically code for testicular proteins as well as highly repetitive sequences which-probably because they are not understoodwere previously considered to be nonfunctional \"junk\" DNA. With the complete sequencing of these regions, it has been found that some of these sequences are palindromic (as in the phrase Anita lava la tina); that is, they read the same from left to right as from right to left, on both strands of the double helix. This fact has led to the hypothesis that X-Y recombination has been replaced by recombination between the arms of the Y chromosome in the regions where the palindromic sequences are located. 12 In this context, the Y chromosome reveals great powers of self-preservation, using evolutionary strategies to survive in the absence of recombination with another homologous chromosome.",

In normal cells, the protein produced by this gene acts as a channel that allows cells to release chloride and other ions. In people with cystic fibrosis, however, this gene has a mutated sequence, and the protein produced is defective so that the cells do not release chloride. The result is an improper salt balance. This gives rise to the production of an abnormally thick mucus which, among other things, obstructs the airways and leads to infections. 13 However, the origin of most human diseases and of the variations in individual responses to drugs is more complex and involves the interrelation between multiple genetic factors, such as genes and the proteins they produce, and nongenetic factors, such as the influence of the environment.",

The remaining 0.1% is responsible for the genetic diversity between individuals. Many differences are due to a variation in a single base pair in a gene. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are variations of a gene that occur because of a change in a single letter (nucleotide) in the DNA sequence, for example, the substitution of \"CTA\" for \"CCA.\" SNPs contribute to the differences between individuals. While most of these polymorphisms have no effect, others cause slight differences in certain characteristics that do not affect health, such as physical appearance. Others, however, may increase or decrease the individual' s risk of developing certain diseases. This happens, for example, in the case of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). We now know that not all individuals exposed to the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) become infected, and that the progression period from infection to AIDS is highly variable among infected individuals. Some patients may develop the disease in 3 years, while others remain asymptomatic for more than 15 years. Although the reasons for these differences are not entirely understood, it has recently been discovered that genetic factors play a very important role in the transmission of the virus and progression to disease. There must be 2 co-receptors on the surface of a cell in order for the virus to attach itself effectively and later infect the host cell. The first of these is CD4, the key receptor for T lymphocyte facilitators, and the second is one of the members of the chemokine family of receptors. C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is one of the main co-receptors used by the virus to penetrate macrophages and T lymphocytes, so that it plays a critical role in the pathogenic process of AIDS. Several studies have demonstrated that the polymorphic allele CCR5-Delta32 (which contains a 32 base pair deletion) has a powerful protective effect in the progression of the HIV infection. 14 Similar findings will probably emerge in relation to other diseases, so that in the future we will understand such enigmas as why not all smokers develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or lung cancer, or why not everyone who is exposed to avian antigens develops hypersensitivity pneumonitis.",

It is still necessary to identify all the genes and ascertain the function of the products expressed by these genes, that is, functional RNA and proteins. Functional genomics is based on the key premise of the central dogma of molecular genetics, which states that DNA sequences are used as templates for the synthesis of RNA, and this RNA is subsequently used as a template for the synthesis of proteins. 17 Moreover, scientists still have to analyze and understand the noncoding regulatory regions and other functional elements of the human genome and of the genomes of other organisms. This has led to the creation of a project called the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements-or ENCODE. The goals of this new project are to identify and map the exact location of all the protein-encoding and non-protein-encoding genes, and to identify other functional elements encoded in the DNA sequences, such as promoters and other transcriptional regulatory sequences, as well as determinants of chromosome structure and function, such as origins of replication. The aim is to provide a comprehensive encyclopedia of all these elements in order to help researchers better understand human biology and predict potential disease risks, and to stimulate the development of new therapies for the prevention and treatment of disease.",

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis belongs to the category of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias and is characterized by the relatively rapid destruction of the lung parenchyma. As a result, some 50% of patients die within 3 years. 20 In a recent study, lung biopsy samples from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other patients with normal lungs were analyzed using this technique of oligonucleotide microarrays. 21 The results showed that gene expression patterns clearly distinguished normal from fibrotic lungs, and that many of the genes that were significantly increased in fibrotic lungs encoded proteins associated with the extracellular matrix and enzymes responsible for its replacement. This study, and others that have investigated various pathological processes, 22 illustrates the analytical power of gene expression in the identification of the molecular pathways involved in disease.",

In private hands, a patent on a viral sequence could delay or increase the cost of developing a treatment or diagnostic tests for a particular disease. This question has caused concern among biomedical researchers, who are afraid that broad patents on genetic sequences will affect research work in universities and public institutions and will have a detrimental effect on future public health strategies. An example of this is the case of the predictive test for breast cancer, which uses the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. The Curie Institute in Paris has been struggling for the right to continue analyzing these genes at a third of the price currently charged by the genome company Myriad Genetics (Utah, USA), which was granted a European patent for these genes in 2001.",
