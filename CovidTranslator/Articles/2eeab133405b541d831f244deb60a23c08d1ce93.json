            "text": "Viruses as obligate intracellular parasites require their host to replicate them and to facilitate their spread to others. In humans, most clinically relevant infections were derived from other animals, and this process continues. Recent examples include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and Zika virus. Viral infections are rarely lethal, even if they are highly cytolytic to individual cells. Mortality commonly occurs when viruses jump species, when the virus undergoes a major antigenic change (i.e., influenza viruses), or when host immunity is compromised. HIV (Chapter 39) represents one of the most dramatic human examples of an exotic virus that kills its host. However, HIV kills slowly, providing ample time to spread to new hosts and an effective strategy for persistence in the species. Death or dire consequences following virus infection in mammals with inadequate immunity are well illustrated by observations that fetuses or neonates, especially if deprived of passive immunity, succumb to many agents well tolerated by healthy adults. The science of viral immunology seeks to understand mechanisms of virus-host interactions with a view to applying this knowledge to the design of effective vaccines and immunomodulators that control virus infections. These objectives are facilitated by an increasing wealth of immunological techniques, an expanding array of genetically manipulated animal models, and an abundance of high throughput technologies, which generate data that can be subjected to complex computational analysis. Such analyses can yield signatures indicative of optimal immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy or failure and can explain the variable outcome of infections in individual hosts. In most situations, defense against viruses involves multiple immune components, and the impact of a single mechanism varies greatly according to the method by which individual viruses enter, replicate, and spread within the host. In this chapter, we highlight the principal means by which the host achieves immunity after infection by viruses. ",

Most effective of these are the mechanical barriers provided by skin and the mucosal surfaces, as well as the chemically hostile environment of the gut (Fig. 25.1) . A number of common human viral pathogens enter through the gastrointestinal tract, including rotavirus, enteric adenoviruses, and hepatitis A virus (HAV). These are usually spread via person-to-person contact or contaminated food and water. Respiratory infections caused by influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, measles virus, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are often spread by aerosol transmission, as well as person-to-person contact. Many of the herpes viruses target the skin or the mucosae, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and VZV. HSV, in particular, can infect the oral and genital mucosae, the eye, and skin through small cuts and abrasions. Other herpes viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), target mucosae. CMV can also spread vertically from mother to baby or rarely via blood transfusions. Human papillomavirus (HPV) targets skin and mucosae and causes warts and may transform cells, inducing cancers, such as cervical cancer. Some viruses, such as West Nile virus, Dengue virus, Semliki forest virus, and Zika virus, can enter through skin via insect vectors. HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are commonly spread via sexual contact. HIV, HBV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) can also infect humans by direct entry into the bloodstream via transfusions or contaminated needles.",

            "text": "Most human viruses replicate only in certain target tissues, this being mainly the consequence of viral receptor distribution. Many viruses use two receptors, such as the use of the CD4 coreceptor and the chemokine receptor CCR5 on T cells by HIV. After attachment to a cellular receptor, viruses may fuse with the cell membrane or be endocytosed and then gain entry into the cytoplasm or nucleus by fusing with the vesicular membrane (enveloped viruses, such as HSV and HIV), or translocate across the cell membrane or induce lysis of the endocytic vesicle once in the cytoplasm (nonenveloped viruses, such as Norwalk virus and poliovirus). 1 Viruses then utilize host cell machinery and specialized virally encoded proteins to replicate rapidly within the cell. Once they have multiplied within the cell, many viruses induce cytolysis to facilitate release of new infectious virions (e.g., poxviruses, poliovirus, and herpes viruses). Other viruses are released from infected cells by budding through the cell membrane in the absence of cell death (e.g., HIV and influenza virus). Having entered the body, however, viruses encounter numerous innate defenses and activate the components of adaptive immunity. The latter usually assures that clinical disease, if not infection, will not become evident. Successful exploitation of these defenses through the use of vaccines (Chapter 90) remains a central challenge for many human viruses, particularly those that cause chronic infections, such as HIV and HCV. 2",

Innate defenses come into play to block or inhibit initial infection, to protect cells from infection, or to eliminate virus-infected cells. Innate mechanisms occur well before the effectors of adaptive immunity become active, but they are critical for the initiation of adaptive immunity via the elicitation of inflammation that promotes immune cell activation. The innate immune defenses are initiated via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) 3 (Chapter 3). These include transmembrane receptors of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, two families of intracellular receptors including the NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and the RIG-I-like helicases (RLHs), as well as the sensor molecule absent in melanoma-2 (AIM2). Additionally, the molecules cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (GMP-AMP) synthase (cGAS), DDX41, IFI16, and Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1) can sense cytosolic DNA (Table 25. 2). These cellular sensors promote the expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-18, type I (\u03b1/\u03b2) interferon (IFN-I), and a variety of IFNstimulated genes and inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines. TLRs are cell surface or endosomal membrane-bound proteins expressed by numerous cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, lymphocytes, and parenchymal cells. Expression of TLRs is largely inducible in most cell types, although some (TLR7/8/9) are constitutively expressed at high levels by specialized plasmacytoid DCs for rapid IFN production. Different TLR molecules recognize specific viral products, such as single-and double-stranded RNA (TLR 3 and TLR7/8, respectively) or double-stranded DNA (TLR9).",

These activate mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) proteins to stimulate IFN-I production and activate inflammasomes, which are molecular complexes that facilitate the activation of caspases and induce the production of proinflammatory IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. 4 NLRs are a second class of cytosolic sensors of PAMPs that activate inflammasomes via the adapter protein ASC. These include the NLRP (or NALP), NOD, and IPAF/NAIP receptors. Three major inflammasomes have been shown to be involved in antiviral immunity: the NLRP3 inflammasome, the RIG-I inflammasome, and the AIM2 inflammasome. 3 The innate defense system consists of multiple cellular components and many specialized proteins. The longest known and best-studied antiviral proteins are the \u03b1/\u03b2 IFNs, which act by binding to the type I IFN receptor and result in the transcription of more than 100 IFN-stimulated genes. One consequence of this \"antiviral state\" is the inhibition of cell protein synthesis and the prevention of viral replication. 5 Multiple leukocyte subsets are involved in innate defense, including macrophages, DCs, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T cells (NKT cells), and \u03b3\u03b4T cells. Furthermore, tissue cells, including fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells, express PRRs and respond to viral infection via the production of innate cytokines, including IFN-I and IL-1. IFN-I is a critical link between the innate and adaptive immune system, via activation of DCs and T cells, as well as protecting T cells from NK cell-mediated attack. 6 IFN-Is can also activate NK cells and induce other cytokines that promote PRRs; the cytokines IFN-I, IL-I, IL-33, and IL-12; and phagocytes, including macrophages, monocytes, and DCs) serve to shape the nature and effectiveness of the subsequent adaptive response to viral pathogens. For instance, DCs require innate signals, such as IFN-I and IL-12, for maturation and optimal T-cell activation. Furthermore, CD8 + T cells responding to viruses need IFN-I and IL-33 signals for expansion and memory formation. Thus both the magnitude and the type of innate response induced by virus infection have a marked influence on the generation of adaptive immune responses.",

            "text": "Innate immunity generally only slows, rather than stops, viral infection, allowing time for the adaptive immune response to begin. The two major divisions of adaptive immunity, antibodymediated and T-cell-mediated, are mainly directed at different targets. Antibodies usually function by binding to free viral particles and, in so doing, block infection of the host cell (Chapter 15). In contrast, T cells act principally by recognizing and destroying virus-infected cells or by orchestrating an inflammatory response that includes several antiviral components (Chapters 16, 17) . As all viruses replicate within cells and many can spread directly between cells without reentering the extracellular environment, resolution of infection is reliant more on T-cell function than on antibody function. However, broadly neutralizing antiviral antibodies have the potential to be effective therapies against many different human infections, including HIV, influenza viruses, and Ebola virus. Recent advances have allowed researchers to isolate and identify human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against these and other pathogens, 12 offering promise of new therapies as well as significant insight for vaccine design. Antiviral antibodies are also very important as an immunoprotective barrier against reinfection. It is the presence of antibodies at portals of entrymost often mucosal surfaces-that is of particular relevance to influenza, HSV, and HIV infections. 13 Yet, how to generate vaccines that induce optimal antibody responses, including broadly neutralizing antibodies, remains an important unsolved problem. Initiation of adaptive immunity is closely dependent on early innate mechanisms that activate antigen-presenting cells (APCs), principally subsets of DCs. APCs and lymphocytes are drawn into lymphoid tissues by chemokine and cytokine signals and are retained there for a few days to facilitate effective intercellular interactions. The architecture of the secondary lymphoid tissues supports the coordinated interactions among the cells of the adaptive immune system 14 through a network of supportive stromal cells and local chemokine gradients 15 (Chapter 2). The induction events occur in lymph nodes draining an infection site or in the spleen if virus enters the bloodstream. The passage of viral antigens to lymph nodes usually occurs in DCs. Some viruses are able to compromise the function of APCs, such as HSV and measles virus, which can inhibit DC maturation.",

            "text": "B-cell activation occurs following antigen encounter in the B-cell follicles, and possibly the T-cell zones, in the spleen or lymph nodes. Some activated B cells become short-lived plasma cells, whereas others move to the edges of the B-cell follicles and interact with antigen-specific helper CD4 + T cells via presentation of antigenic peptides on B-cell MHC class II molecules. These Bcl6-dependent CD4 T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are specialized for providing help for B-cell responses and are needed to promote and regulate B-cell responses. 16 Activated B cells initiate germinal center (GC) reactions with the help of CD4 Tfh cells, ensuring NK responses, such as IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12. NK cells produce proinflammatory cytokines; they can kill infected cells and interact with DCs, and are an important component of innate defense against viruses. NK cells can protect against some herpes viruses, which downregulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression in the cells they infect. NK cells are also important in resistance to mouse and human CMV and possibly to HIV, influenza virus, and Ebola virus. 7 NK cells have also recently been shown to possess traits of adaptive immunity and, like T and B cells, can form populations of memory cells. 8 NK cells are regulated by an array of activating and inhibitory receptors, whose expression and function are just beginning to be understood. Uninfected cells are usually protected from NK cell cytolysis as they deliver negative signals, such as high expression of MHC molecules. In contrast, virus-infected cells are killed either because they deliver positive signals or because they lack adequate MHCnegative signals. NK cells may also control excessive immune responses to viruses by killing CD4 + T cells and indirectly regulating cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. NKT cells may provide some antigen-specific innate immune protection against certain viruses, such as influenza virus. 9 Several classes of innate host proteins function in antiviral defense. These include natural antibodies, which may play a role in defense against some viral infections, as well as pentraxins and complement proteins. 10 Some viruses may be directly inactivated by complement activation or be destroyed by phagocytic cells that bind and ingest complement-bound virions. Several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced by virus infection also play key roles in defense. Foremost among these is IL-1 and other members of the IL-1 family, including IL-18 and IL-33. 11 These cytokines influence both innate and adaptive immune cells and play critical roles in antiviral defense. Other antiviral cytokines are produced early following infection, such as TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, IL-6, and chemokines, such as MIP-1\u03b1. In particular, IL-12 is a potent inducer of IFN-\u03b3 from NK cells. Inflammatory chemokines may also play an important role in innate antiviral defense by orchestrating macrophage, neutrophil, DC, and NK cell responses at the site of infection. Not only are these components of innate immunity involved in mediating initial protection against viruses; several components (e.g., the Acting to block infection: Natural antibodies Complement components Some cytokines and chemokines Acting to protect cells from infection:",

Sometimes the consequence is viral lysis (with complement proteins also involved), opsonization, or sensitization for destruction by Fc receptor-bearing cells that mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Occasionally, however, Fc receptor binding of antibody-bound virus may facilitate infection and result in more severe tissue damage. This occurs in Dengue fever and may happen in some instances in HIV infection. The antibody involved in the protection of mucosal surfaces in humans is predominantly secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA), but serum-derived IgG may also be protective, particularly in such sites as the vaginal mucosa. 13 Both antibody isotypes act mainly to block infection of epithelial cells, although in some instances, the antibody may transport antigen from within the body across epithelial cells to the outside. Mucosal antibody persists for a much shorter period compared with serum antibody, which explains, in part, why immunity to mucosal pathogens is usually of much shorter duration compared with immunity to systemic viral infections.

Humoral memory to viruses involves long-lived plasma cells in bone marrow, which provide a continuous low-level source of serum antibody. This maintenance of humoral immunity also involves a population of homeostatically maintained memory B cells, which may be required to maintain stable numbers of long-lived plasma cells over time. The pool of memory T cells is regulated by low-level homeostatic division controlled by the cytokines IL-7 and IL-15.

They represent an expanded pool of CTL precursors that can be activated upon secondary encounter with antigen and provide enhanced protection upon reinfection with the same virus (see next section). Although much of our knowledge of T-cell responses to viruses has been obtained from murine studies, it is increasingly clear that the fundamental principles are the same or similar in humans. 19 T-cell immunity against a particular virus involves both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell subsets that recognize peptides derived from viral antigens bound to surface MHC proteins (class II and class I, respectively) (Chapters 5, 6). Complexes of viral peptides bound to MHC class II proteins are generated by APCs from scavenged and processed virus-infected cells or viral particles. Antigen-MHC class I complexes are expressed on the surface of infected cells, and antigen can also be transferred to APCs from infected cells by a process known as cross-presentation. Recent experiments in mice have also demonstrated a role for transfer of antigen between DCs as they migrate from infected tissues to the lymphoid tissues. Multiple subsets of DCs exist and specialize somewhat in antigen presentation on MHC-I or MHC-II. 20 During the process of activation, T cells can receive signals from multiple DC types in a temporally controlled sequence that coordinates CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell interactions. 18 Use of MHC class I and class II tetramers to directly visualize antigen-specific CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell responses, respectively, has demonstrated the significant size of T-cell responses to viruses, such that the majority of the activated T cells seen at the peak of the response are virus-specific.",

The current model predicts that effector T cells form the T EM subset and that these cells gradually convert to a T CM phenotype over time (Fig. 25.2B) . Although the conditions that control the rate of this conversion are unknown, it is likely that the amounts of antigen and inflammatory signals received during the effector phase greatly influence this. It has also been shown that CD4 + T-cell help is required for the generation of long-lived memory CD8 + T cells, via interactions with DCs. 21 Studies suggest that T CM are capable of mounting stronger proliferative responses following reinfection. Tissue-specific homing of T EM cells permits them to enter sites of potential viral infection, such as skin and mucosae. However, we now know that many memory T cells found at sites of previous viral infections take up long-term residence in tissues. 26 This includes skin, intestines, lungs, the liver, and the brain.

It is particularly characteristic of chronic viral infections that clinical expression is highly variable.

Such situations most commonly involve persistent viruses, which are themselves often mildly cytodestructive in the absence of an immune reaction. Chronic tissue damage initiated by viruses can also result in development of an autoreactive and an occasionally oncogenic response. For example, some autoimmune diseases may be initiated or exacerbated by viral infections, but no named virus has been regularly incriminated as a cause of human autoimmune disease. 33 Circumstantial evidence exists for a virus link in multiple sclerosis (MS), insulindependent diabetes, and possibly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In MS, many viruses have been isolated from patients, although no specific one has been tied to the disease etiology. The current hypothesis is that viral infections set up an other components of the immune system or their receptors. Viruses also resort to antigenic hypervariability to escape antibody or T-cell recognition.

However, these viruses generally remain undetectable in immunocompetent individuals. Other viral infections, such as those caused by the herpes viruses HSV and VZV, are marked by periods of latency when no virus can be detected. Yet, periods of viral reactivation, often triggered by stress, can lead to episodes of disease.

Such chronic viral infections are marked by high levels of persisting antigen and can result in skewed T-cell immunodominance hierarchies, altered tissue localization of immune cells, and severely impaired T-cell function. 30 This altered T-cell function is hierarchical and results in functional T-cell defects ranging from reduced cytokine production and altered proliferative capacity (exhaustion) to death (deletion) of the responding T cells (Fig. 25.4) .",

This is in stark contrast to normal memory T-cell development, which occurs in the absence of persisting antigen (see previous section). Studies have demonstrated that signaling through multiple inhibitory receptors expressed on the cell surface contributes to exhaustion during chronic infections. 30 This includes the receptor programmed death (PD)-1, expression of which may be essential for preventing excessive immunopathology by effector T cells and yet appears to contribute directly to failed immunity to HIV infection and other chronic human viral infections. Although the molecular mechanisms of exhaustion remain unclear, differential involvement of transcription factors and altered gene expression define Immunopathological reactions against viruses can also involve subsets of CD4 + T cells, which can be either Th1 or Th17 or both. One well-studied example involves persistent infection with Theiler virus in mice. 34 This infection causes a demyelinating syndrome that resembles the autoimmune disease experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. In both situations, CD4 + T cells that produce Th1 cytokines appear to serve as pathological mediators. Furthermore, in both models an increase in the involvement of myelin-derived autoantigens occurs as the disease progresses. Once again, such observations indicate the possible role of a virus in an autoimmune disease. With the Theiler virus model, the virus persists in the nervous system and chronically stimulates CD4 + T cells to secrete an array of cytokines. The demyelinating events appear to result from cytokine action on oligodendrocytes. Myelin components, such as myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein, may be released and can participate as additional antigen in immunoinflammatory events. This scenario is referred to as epitope spreading.",

The clearest example of immunopathology involving a virus is lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in the mouse. This model has dominated ideas and has set several paradigms in viral immunology in general. The first virus-induced immunopathological lesions recognized were glomerulonephritis and arteritis, noted in mice persistently infected with LCMV. The lesions were assumed to represent inflammatory reactions to tissue-entrapped immune complexes that activate complement. Similar immune complexmediated lesions occur in other infections, including lung lesions found in severe influenza, respiratory syncytial virus infection, viral hepatitis, and arthritis. However, only rarely have viral antigens been shown to contribute to the antigen component of the complex. An example where the inclusion of viral antigen in immune complexes has been demonstrated is chronic HBV infection of humans. Autoimmune diseases, such as SLE, also result from immune complex-mediated tissue damage. However, evidence linking viruses to the etiology or pathogenesis of SLE is scarce, since the immune complexes in SLE do not appear to include viral antigens at any stage.",

Neither lesion becomes evident if the CD8 + T-cell response is suppressed. CD8 + T cell-mediated immunopathology can be a causative mechanism of chronic hepatitis associated with HCV and HBV infection, although the tissue damage also involves inflammatory CD4 + T cells. Additional viral immunopathology models where lesions result primarily from CD8 + T-cell involvement include myocarditis and insulin-dependent diabetes associated with coxsackie B virus infection. In both instances, CD8 + T cells mainly orchestrate events, but tissue damage may result from the bystander effects of cytokines and other molecules, such as lipid mediators, biology approaches are expected to result in novel screening for immune protection parameters after vaccination. In the near future, this should also assist in the formulation of new vaccines containing key immune activators, such as those that stimulate certain subsets of T cells or induce appropriate homing molecule expression on these cells to direct them to tissues where they are required to mediate protection (e.g., mucosal sites, or skin).",

Both primary and recall T-cell responses undergo expansion and contraction phases, followed by stable immune memory. Recall responses induce a larger effector pool and reduced contraction further boosting the memory pool. (B) Effector and memory T-cell differentiation. Antigen stimulation expands effector cells, most of which die during the contraction phase. Effector memory T (T EM ) cells that are formed gradually convert to central memory T (T CM ) cells over time, with corresponding changes in surface marker expression. Some effector T cells develop into resident memory T (T RM ) cells that persist in the tissues and do not reenter the circulation. IL-13), also participates in inflammatory reactions, although in the case of viruses, these are usually more tissue damaging than protective. This situation can occur in responses to RSV infection. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a further subset of CD4 + T cells of particular importance, since these cells largely act to regulate the function of effector subsets and, in so doing, influence the severity and duration of inflammatory reactions 22 (Chapter 18). Tregs produce antiinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, and can be distinguished from other CD4 + subsets by their expression of a unique transcription factor FoxP3. The balance of CD4 + T-cell subset representation in response to a virus infection is critical. In situations where responses become overtly tissue damaging and chronic, the balance favors effector subsets. In such situations, changing the balance to favor Tregs can result in diminished lesions.",
