The inherent limitations posed by the requisite human-animal interactions are often undefined and underappreciated. The national surveillance system for animal rabies in the United States was examined as a model system; reporting of animal rabies is legally mandated, each case of rabies is laboratory confirmed, and data have been consistently collected for more than 50 years. Factors influencing the monthly counts of animal rabies tests reported during 1992-2001 were assessed by univariate and multivariable regression methods. The suitability of passively collected surveillance data for determining the presence or absence of the raccoon-associated variant of rabies within states and within individual counties was assessed by determining critical threshold values from the regression analyses. The size of the human population and total expenditures within a county accounted for 72% and 67%, respectively, of the variance in testing. The annual median number of rabies tests performed was seven for counties without rabies, 22 for counties with non-raccoon rabies, and 34 for counties with raccoon rabies. Active www.elsevier.com/locate/prevetmed Preventive Veterinary Medicine 78 (2007) 246-261 surveillance may be required in locales with sparse human populations when a high degree of confidence in the status of rabies is required. #",

Systematic surveillance at the national level requires a central authority which receives standardized reports of incident cases of disease or infection occurring among wildlife within geographically and politically defined surveillance units during specified time intervals which are generated by regional veterinary or public health officials. Ideally, reporting by local authorities would be legally mandated and standardized and suspected cases of disease would be confirmed by clinical samples tested at a diagnostic laboratory using validated methods. Epidemiologists at the central authority would collate and analyze the regional data to provide local authorities with a comprehensive national report on disease activity. Recent experiences with avian influenza virus A, subtype H5N1 (Ellis et al., 2004) , SARS coronavirus (Lau et al., 2005) , and the henipaviruses (Mackenzie, 2005) have focused attention on the possible benefits of collecting epidemiologic information on virus maintenance within wildlife populations serving as reservoir hosts.",

The median number of rabid raccoons reported per county-year was significantly correlated (r 2 = 0.54) with the total number of raccoons tested; the ''required'' minimum number of raccoons tested to detect a single rabid raccoon was approximately 2.6. Mapping the locations of the 288 counties testing <2.6 raccoons per year indicated that most of the counties reporting no rabies present or no raccoon-variant associated rabies were outside the known endemic area of raccoon-associated rabies or in states (Maine and New York) at the boundary of the expanding wavefront of the raccoon rabies epidemic in 2001 (Fig. 4a) . However, counties with low annual rates of testing raccoons were also evident within endemic regions of raccoon-associated rabies and were common throughout regions rabies reported, rabies reported but not among raccoons, and no rabies reported. Areas of low reporting and of special interest as sites of oral rabies vaccine (ORV) delivery are circled. (b) Counties reporting >2.6 and 2.6 raccoons tested for rabies, the suggested threshold needed to on average detect a single rabid raccoon. Enlarged circled areas indicate regions with low rabies reporting considered to be at risk for rabies introduction through long distance translocation.",

Similar criteria can be applied to state reporting and in 1992 the CDC requested that states submit the results from all rabies tests performed to specifically assess the adequacy of surveillance coverage. However, cursory examination of surveillance reports from 19 states submitted from 1992 to 2001, using an index of !50% negative test results as an operational measure of adequate surveillance, revealed three states where insufficient laboratory test data precluded interpretation of the absence of rabies reporting; other states had a varied record of complete reporting. The operational criteria for adequate reporting used herein was liberal, chosen to capture states where limited resources may preclude testing of animals other than those directly involved in a potential rabies exposure to a human or domestic animal. When raccoon rabies is epidemic in a state the percentage of raccoons testing rabid can approach 60% in a given year (Beck et al., 1987; Fischman et al., 1992) ; the overall percentage of rabid animals will be diluted by negative results from other species and will fall below 50% (Gordon et al., 2004) . As no guidelines exist as how to define adequate surveillance this arbitrary, but transparent, measure was selected as an initial reference value that in the future may be further reassessed and refined.",

Regression analysis of the number of rabid raccoons detected per number of animal rabies tests performed in the 169 townships of Connecticut revealed a strong positive association (r 2 = 0.57; p < 0.01), nearly identical to the value obtained herein (r 2 = 0.54; p < 0.01). The robustness of this association across different geographic scales (169 townships versus eight counties) is consistent with results indicating that the percent of rabid animals identified becomes stable above a critical number of animal tests (Fig. 1c) . This asymptotic relationship was well illustrated by the differences in median numbers of animals tested per county-year in laboratory counties (213 animals) and non-laboratory counties (25) where the percentage of rabid animals was identical (6.5% and 6.4%).",

Although urban parks can support some of the highest densities of raccoons recorded (Riley et al., 1998) , indices of raccoon population size and distribution indicate this species is absent or rare in the most densely populated areas of cities (Anthony et al., 1990) .

Long distance translocations created epidemic foci in advance of the traveling wavefront of epidemic raccoon rabies in Connecticut . Potential routes of raccoon rabies spread from breech points in the Ohio ORV barrier have been identified, and coupled with active surveillance programs, these methods can improve rapid detection and help target remedial intervention activities (Russell et al., 2004 . This study had several limitations. The most obvious is reliance on the relative qualities of surveillance data from a broad region to reach conclusions on the level of rabies surveillance activity within specific states and counties. There are no additional independent sources of animal rabies data available to assess the completeness of rabies reporting, therefore, the comparative approach was used to evaluate the adequacy of existing surveillance activities. Furthermore, this study pooled county reports submitted from 1992-2001 and levels of raccoon rabies varied within each county during this interval (Childs et al., 2000; Gordon et al., 2005) .

Within the United States both the number of persons and the resources available were significantly associated with surveillance activity. However, local county features also influenced the rate of rabies testing. Variation in complete reporting of test results complicated unambiguous interpretation of the presence or absence of raccoon-associated rabies in specific areas.
