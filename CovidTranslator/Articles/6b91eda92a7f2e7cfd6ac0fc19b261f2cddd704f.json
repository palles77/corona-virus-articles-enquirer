It could be because of several etiologies; of these bacterial pharyngitis is the most important. Major challenge for the clinician is to diagnose group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngitis and diphtheria, which are associated with serious complications. Throat swab smear with culture and rapid antigen tests are useful for making the diagnosis but the later may not be available in resource poor settings. Many clinical scores have been devised to diagnose GABHS with variable success but usually clinical features, epidemiological criteria and expert clinical judgment with or without supportive investigations indicate need for antibiotics. A child with sore throat and toxic look may have diphtheria or parapharyngeal/retropharyngeal abscess, and therefore should be hospitalized.",

Pharyngitis refers to objective evidence of inflammation of the pharynx, such as exudates, ulceration, or definite erythema. Redness of the throat may occur as part of the general redness of all mucous membranes in a patient with fever.

A clinical scoring system has been designed in India but it has to be validated for local use. This scoring system uses variables such as age, season, fever, erythema of pharynx, size of tonsil, pharyngeal exudates; lymphadenopathy and pain in throat, and scores are assigned according to throat culture positivity in association with the same.
