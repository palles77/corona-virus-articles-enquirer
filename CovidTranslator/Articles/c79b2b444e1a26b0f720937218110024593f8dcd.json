            "text": "Background: In the absence of a comprehensive review, we conducted a systematic review on the use of systematic approach in outbreak investigation using reports from India. Objectives: The primary objective was to estimate the proportion of outbreak reports from India during 2008-16, that reported the steps in outbreak investigation. The secondary objectives were to (1) describe the outbreak reports by selected characteristics (source, investigating agency, disease, time, place and person) (2) estimate the proportion of outbreaks that conducted analytical and additional studies. Methods: We searched eight electronic databases and grey literature for outbreak investigation reports among humans at community settings from India during 2008-2016. We developed a check-list based on the 10-steps approach used by Field Epidemiology Training Programme (FETP) of ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology (ICMR-NIE), Chennai, India. This checklist was used to independently screen and extract data on general characteristics of the outbreak investigation reports and the steps completed. We adopted The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) check list for prevalence studies to examine the credibility and consistency. The protocol was registered at Prospero (CRD42017065038). We calculated proportion of reports that followed the steps in their investigation and descriptive statistics on selected characteristics. Results: Of 10,657 articles screened, 136 articles were included for the review. Completion of the ten steps in the outbreak investigations was seen in 16% of reports. The highest level of completion was for drawing conclusion in outbreak investigation (98%) and the lowest completion (29%) was for developing a case definition by time, place and person followed by conducting an analytic study (24%). Conclusions: Outbreak reports from India either lacked application of systematic steps for investigation or failed to report the actual procedures followed. We recommend improving systematic investigation of outbreaks through training and supervision of outbreak response teams and encouraging publications.",

            "text": "Outbreaks are public health emergencies that require a systematic investigation for early identification of causative factors so as to reduce morbidity, fatality and develop effective public health measures. 1 While conducting an outbreak investigation one requires following a methodological approach. The United States of America Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta proposes a 10-steps process in outbreak investigation that is adaptable to circumstances, resources available or suspected cause. [1] [2] [3] The application of such a systematic approach allows in defining the outbreak, identifying the risk factors and application of interventions, that could alter the risk of transmission post-assessment. There exists a logical sequence in the 10steps followed during an outbreak investigation but in some situations, these steps may occur simultaneously. 4 The use of such a systematic approach for conducting outbreak investigations is evident in solving many outbreak investigations of unknown etiology of commonly reported conditions. This is elicited by the systematic approach that was used in the investigation of hepatitis A caused by the consumption of raw shellfish in Pascagoula, Mississippi in 1968. 5 Further, such systematic investigation of HIV pandemic resulted in identification of the risk factors well-before the confirmation of causative agent. In the Indian context, the utility of conducting a systematic outbreak investigation was demonstrated by the identification https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2019.02.010 Received 24 October 2018; Received in revised form 30 January 2019; Accepted 23 February 2019 of the possible causative agent for recurrent outbreaks of a mystery illness in Muzaffarpur, Bihar that was first investigated in 2013 and later reinvestigated in 2014. [6] [7] [8] In India, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is the apex institution that deals with infectious disease research, surveillance, investigations and response in the country. NCDC is responsible for implementing India's Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) and mandates weekly reporting, investigation and response to outbreaks in different parts of the country. The NCDC recommends 10-step approach for outbreak investigations in India. 1 Other public health institutions like medical colleges and public-private health agencies also conduct outbreak investigations in India.",

The completion of steps in outbreak investigation was described as cumulative proportion and for that of each step of the outbreak investigation and subcomponents of each of those steps. The gaps in reporting at each level were identified and summarized. For describing each step, we adapted the outbreak investigation checklist for 10-steps approach used by the Field Epidemiology Training Programme (FETP) at ICMR-NIE. 1 (S4 Table) The 10-steps were classified into the main steps and their subcomponents. Reporting of the main steps and subcomponents of those steps were taken as completion of the steps, and the completion of any one subcomponent of the step was taken as completion of the main step. The preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed in reporting the methods and results of the review (S3 Table PRISMA guidelines for reporting systematic reviews). judging bias was developed by modifying the The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for prevalence studies with criteria relevant for reporting an outbreak investigation. 16 A score of one was assigned to each component and 0.5 to each subcomponent of the checklist. A higher weightage was given to criteria 1, 2. 7 and 8 this was decided based by review team members (S5 Table) . Credibility was judged by the completion of the four major criteria and consistency was judged by the adherence in reporting an outbreak by time, place and person with relevant analysis and recommendations. Quality of study was categorized into low quality (If even one of the four criteria was not covered) incomplete descriptive findings and analytic findings), medium quality (All the four criteria were covered) and high quality (for a score of 6-7).",

The plague outbreak in Surat, 1994, is one such example that led to a near international isolation of India. 17 This outbreak led to initiatives and policy decisions to develop a robust surveillance system to prevent such future outbreaks. 2 In fact, India established the National Surveillance Programme for Communicable Diseases in 1997 and was later on up-scaled to IDSP in 2004 with the assistance from World Bank. According to a recent review of IDSP (2015), the issues still needing attention were that of poor quality surveillance and reporting, limited specimen testing in outbreaks and low laboratory standards 18 ; lack of useful data and data analytics; nonfunctional surveillance committees, a higher priority to disease of other vertical programmes; no defined core competencies for staff, high vacancies, contractual post and lacunae in the fund release 18 We presume that combination of such identified issues could have contributed to the gaps that were observed in the systematic approach to outbreak investigations in India. [6] [7] [8] 10 Our findings of use of 10-step approach in majority of the outbreaks reported by FETP or ICMR led investigations is pointer to the fact that collaboration among public health agencies and quality trained graduates bring to the table use of methodological approach to outbreak investigation and effective containment. Such evidence from India is worth noting for policy makers, whereas, such international experience had earlier been documented in case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in China 19 and Canada 2003, Avian influenza in Thailand 2004, Ebola outbreak in Uganda in 2000. 2, 9 ICMR is the apex body for formulating, coordinating and promoting research. 20 Most of the reviewed outbreak investigation reports were handled by ICMR either alone or in partnership. 10 However, even with the availability of quality training, a good surveillance system, and adequate resources, our study documents that there are reporting gaps in the systematic approach to outbreak investigation. Previous studies recognize lack of reporting of the actual procedures followed in outbreak investigation by the investigating teams. 10, 12, 24 In order to improve better reporting practices of outbreak investigations in published literature, a 22 item checklist -\"Outbreak Response and Intervention studies of Nosocomial Infection\" (ORION) was developed in 2007 by Stone SP et al. 21 A follow-up review close to a decade after the ORION guidelines were framed, reported a failure in the completion of reports as per these guidelines. 22 Our study has followed the 10-steps approach since both international and national agencies have advocated the need to stringently follow these ten steps while conducting an outbreak investigation. Nevertheless, it is possible that the authors might have overlooked reporting of these steps based on the journal's target Table 3 Distribution of outbreak reports (2008-16) by the completion of subcomponents for each step in an outbreak investigation, India.",

However, by using this review tool, we would also like to draw attention to the need for guidelines while reporting such field-based investigations. Hence, only through mandatory compliance with guidelines while publishing an outbreak investigation, we can improve the quality of reporting of available information. Reporting the steps holds importance in ensuring that a systematic methodology and transparency are followed and clarifies any concerns raised by the audience in the conduct of an outbreak investigation. The significance of these steps is that it contributes to early detection and developing effective measures that addresses the population exposed, the causality criteria and sources identified from an analytic study. 1, 6 One may argue that often during emergency response, steps are missed/overlooked leading to \"quick and dirty investigations\". However, uniformity of data quality and timeliness of outbreak reporting system are key considerations for data sharing between countries. 23 The strength of this review is that we examined the methodological completion of individual steps and its subcomponents of 10-step outbreak investigation checklist followed by FETP that is universally known for promoting hands-on training on the use of such systematic approach. Hence, we could identify the essential steps that were least reported. The lack of information in preparing case definitions and conducting analytic studies have been reported in previous studies 6, 7, 12, 24, 25 and supportive evidence was also available from the present study. Further, on the basis of our review, we highlight the importance of specimen collection and histo-pathological examination and the conduct of autopsies as and when indicated.",

We could have under-estimated the actual use of systematic outbreak investigation methodology in the field. However, actual use may be difficult to arrive at and hence, we did consult grey literature to partially overcome this limitation. On the other hand, we could have over-estimated the use of completion of 10steps in the published outbreaks due to publication bias associated with such investigations. This limitation is difficult to avoid and our estimates are available by investigating agencies that allows us to interpret accordingly. It may be possible that public health trainees (such as FETP) may tend to accurately report the systematic methodology due to the academic rigor and expectations. However, our primary interest was in estimating proportion of published outbreak reports following 10-steps irrespective of the author profile. Despite these limitations, our findings do provide important information on existing gaps that require immediate attention from surveillance and outbreak response authorities, investigating agencies and may be publishing houses. 18 Additionally, we also conducted critical appraisal of the study designs using a modified JBI checklist to estimate the quality of the reporting.",
