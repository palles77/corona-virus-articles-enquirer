FebriDx carries a CE mark for use in the EU and is also approved in several other countries, including Canada, Saudi Arabia and Singapore. It is indicated for use in patients > 2 years old with symptoms consistent with a community-acquired ARI. The test involves the use of an immunoassay on a fingerstick blood sample to provide simultaneous, qualitative measurement of elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA). In two prospective, multicentre studies in patients with acute upper respiratory tract infections, FebriDx was shown to be both sensitive and specific in identifying patients with a clinically significant infection and in differentiating between infections of bacterial and viral aetiology. The test is simple, requires no additional equipment and produces actionable results in ~ 10 min. As was demonstrated in a small, retrospective analysis, FebriDx results can help guide (improve) antibiotic prescribing decisions. Reducing the unnecessary or inappropriate prescription of antibiotics for ARIs of probable viral aetiology is important for antibiotic stewardship and can also reduce the unnecessary exposure of patients to the risk of antibiotic-related adverse events. FebriDx thus represents a useful diagnostic tool in the outpatient setting.",

Given their overlapping profiles of signs and symptoms, distinguishing between ARIs of bacterial and viral aetiology can be clinically challenging [2] . Clinical uncertainty regarding the infection aetiology, along with other factors (e.g. patient or parental pressure or expectations [3] ), frequently results in the prescription of antibiotics for infections of probable viral aetiology despite no likely benefit [4] [5] [6] . The unnecessary or inappropriate prescription of antibiotics can have broad negative consequences, including contributing to the rise and spread of antimicrobial resistance (itself considered one of the biggest threats to global health) [7, 8] and unnecessarily exposing the patient to the risk of adverse events (including life-threatening events, e.g. anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Clostridium difficile infection) [9] [10] [11] . As well as negatively affecting patient health and care (at both the individual and population level), these effects are also associated with significant economic costs [12] [13] [14] .",

CRP levels become markedly elevated in the presence of a clinically significant acute bacterial infection and, as such, CRP measurement can play a role in the diagnosis of such infections; however, CRP is not considered to be sufficiently specific as a marker on its own to differentiate between bacterial and viral infections [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . MxA is an intracellular GTPase protein that is induced by type I and type III interferons [27] and which serves as a sensitive and specific marker for viral infection [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . MxA has antiviral activity against a broad range of pathogenic viruses, and interferon production in response to viral infection leads to an increase in MxA levels [27] . The rationale behind the FebriDx test is that through measurement of CRP and MxA together, it can combine the sensitivity of CRP with the specificity of MxA such that, when used together in a rapid point-of-care test, these markers can serve to aid in the differentiation between viral and bacterial ARIs [16] .",

The test strip contains two result lines, one for CRP and one for MxA (with monoclonal anti-CRP and anti-MxA antibodies, respectively), and a control line [16] . The FebriDx test produces visual, qualitative results-if the serum level of CRP and/or MxA meets the cut-off level (i.e. \u2265 20 mg/L for CRP and \u2265 40 ng/mL for MxA), a corresponding (positive) line will appear in the results window [16, 19] . These cut-off levels were selected to optimize the sensitivity and specificity of the combination to differentiate between viral and bacterial ARIs [33] . Whereas patients with ARI symptoms and a CRP level < 20 mg/L are likely to have a non-bacterial and/ or self-limiting infection, CRP levels \u2265 20 mg/L are associated with a clinically significant immune response; an MxA level \u2265 40 ng/mL was established as a sensitive cut-off for identifying viral infections [33] [34] [35] .",

An algorithm based on the reference testing data was used to classify patients. Under both the FebriDx testing and the reference testing algorithm, patients were classified as a having a bacterial ARI, a viral ARI, or negative for a clinically significant ARI. Additionally, a panel of two physicians with expertise in respiratory infections, and who were blinded to the FebriDx test results, reviewed each individual patient case report together with the reference testing results and could overrule the reference testing algorithm classification to give the final reference classification [34, 35] .",

            "text": "UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pneumonia recommend that point-of-care CRP testing be considered for patients presenting with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection when, after clinical assessment, it is uncertain whether antibiotics should be prescribed [41] . The qualitative FebriDx test measures elevated levels of CRP while simultaneously measuring elevated levels of the viral infection marker MxA together in a simple, rapid, all-in-one, point-of-care test (Sect. 3). The use of the two markers in FebriDx combines the sensitivity of CRP with the specificity of MxA such that, in combination, they can be used to distinguish between viral and bacterial ARIs. Indeed, the clinical performance of the FebriDx test in identifying patients with bacterial ARIs in the outpatient setting was favourable when compared with stand-alone CRP (20 mg/L) or procalcitonin (0.25 ng/mL) qualitative measurement [35] . Furthermore, in indirect comparisons with a diagnostic assay using a combination of CRP, tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and interferon gamma induced protein-10 (IP-10) measurement [42] [43] [44] , FebriDx appeared to have similar clinical performance but with the advantages of greater ease of use and more rapid (actionable) results [35] . Another benefit of the FebriDx test is that, unlike pathogen-specific diagnostic tools (e.g. pathogen-specific PCR-based methods), measurement of CRP and MxA (each a component of the body's immune response) enables FebriDx to distinguish between an infection and the presence of a pathogen in a carrier/colonization state [34, 35] . Based on two prospective, multicentre studies in patients with ARIs (predominantly upper respiratory tract infections, but including patients with acute bronchitis), FebriDx has been shown to be both sensitive and specific in differentiating between infections of viral and bacterial aetiologies (Sect. 4). Of note, the accuracy of the test appeared to be highest when used on patients with confirmed fever at the time of testing. FebriDx is not able to identify patients with a viral and bacterial co-infection (with a host response to both infections); however, such cases appear to be rare (Sect. 3). When defined as the presence of both a viral and a bacterial pathogen (confirmed by PCR and/or bacterial culture) together with a host response inclusive of elevated procalcitonin (\u2265 0.25 ng/mL) and/or white blood cell count (\u2265 12,000/\u03bcL), viral and bacterial co-infection was not observed in the two key trials [34, 35] . Importantly, the FebriDx test was shown to rule out the presence of a clinically significant bacterial infection with a high degree of accuracy (NPV for bacterial infection was 97% in both studies and was 99-100% in patients with confirmed fever at enrolment), suggesting that FebriDx can be used to support the use of a watchful waiting strategy in appropriate cases. The two trials were generally well designed; however, there were some limitations to the data [34, 35] . Most notable of these was the relatively low proportion of paediatric patients (aged < 18 years) included in the trials (16% overall). Given that paediatric patients compose a large proportion of primary care visits for ARIs, further evaluation of the clinical performance of FebriDx in paediatric patients would be of strong interest. Another limitation of the available data is that due to practical constraints, the study populations in the key trials were convenience samples rather than consecutive eligible patients, which potentially could have resulted in a sampling bias.",

Besides its high level of accuracy, another key benefit of FebriDx is its ability to provide rapid, actionable results at point-of-care which can be used to aid clinical management decisions. Based on a small retrospective outcome analysis, use of FebriDx resulted in a reduction in unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions with no subsequent testing-related adverse events observed (Sect. 5). Accepting the limitations of this small retrospective study (which involved 21 patients from a single practice in the UK), this analysis demonstrated the potential utility of FebriDx in improving the clinical management of patients with ARIs. While clinical uncertainty can lead to the unnecessary or inappropriate prescription of antibiotics for ARIs that are self-limiting and/or of likely viral aetiology [45] , use of an accurate diagnostic test at point-of-care to complement clinical judgement may give clinicians more confidence to follow a watchful waiting strategy when appropriate by identifying a low likelihood of a bacterial infection. Furthermore, the availability of clear, simple, visual results (as FebriDx produces) could potentially be used to alleviate patient or parental pressure to prescribe antibiotics when they are not considered necessary. Another aspect of the clinical utility of FebriDx is its potential (through the reduction of unnecessary antibiotics) to reduce the occurrence of antibiotic-related adverse events.",

A positive result for CRP but not MxA is indicative of a bacterial infection. The absence of a positive result line for both CRP and MxA indicates a negative result, suggesting that the patient lacks a significant systemic response; however, a negative result does not exclude a respiratory infection and should not be used in isolation as the basis for diagnosis and patient management decisions. For any individual test performed, the absence of a positive result for the control line indicates an invalid test result. FebriDx test results are stable for up to 1 h[16,19].",
