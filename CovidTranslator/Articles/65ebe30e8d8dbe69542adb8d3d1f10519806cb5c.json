Schools frequently have trouble maintaining indoor relative humidity (RH) within the optimum range (30-50%) for reducing allergens and irritants.

Asthma triggers prevalent in damp environments have been reported in middle schools in North Carolina (NC), a state with a fairly humid climate throughout the year (Mirabelli et al. 2006 ). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (US EPA) Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Tools for Schools Action Kit recommends that indoor RH levels should ideally be between 30-50%, or at least below 60% (U.S. EPA 2009).

There was a slightly elevated, though non-statistically significant association between asthma-like symptoms and high (>50%) RH for all lag periods. With a two day lag of low (<30%) RH, the association was less than null, which could possibly indicate a reduction in moisture related allergens. Exposure to five days of high (>50%) or low (<30%) classroom RH was associated with increased risk of both asthma and cold/ allergy symptoms, which is suggestive of a cumulative effect of indoor RH on the human body. These effects may be immunological, inflammatory responses to the climatic conditions themselves or to aeroallergens and other indoor pollutants that may be increased at extreme values of RH.",

Since both outcome and exposure data were likely missing at random and missing data patterns were related to other complete variables, we imputed missing values to improve our model estimate accuracy.

Also, we expect that maintaining classroom RH levels between 30-50% would reduce allergens and irritants, which would reduce the risk of asthma development. Thus, possible mechanisms for the relationship between extreme classroom RH and asthma-like symptoms that should be explored in future research include both direct effects of RH on inflammatory pathways and indirect effects of extremely high or low RH by providing a hospitable environment for allergens and pathogens.",
