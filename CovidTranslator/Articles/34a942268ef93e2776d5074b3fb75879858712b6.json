Her condition was improved only with conservative treatment. After a full recovery of MERS, the patient manifested abrupt vaginal bleeding with rupture of membrane.

While febrile, she had been in close contact with her daughter, a 39-year-old pregnant woman (gravida 2 para 1). On June 8 (35 weeks and 4 days of gestational age [GA]), this pregnant woman visited the emergency room complaining of mild myalgia. Based on this contact history with a MERS patient and her symptoms, a MERS-CoV PCR test was performed and the result was found to be positive on June 9. Starting from June 9, the patient developed dyspnea and sputum production. Although chest auscultation was normal, the oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 95% in room air and chest radiography showed diffuse opacity in the left lower lung area compared to a previously obtained radiographic image. The laboratory findings included a leukocyte count of 5,570/mm 3 (normal range 4,000-10,000/mm 3 ), with a differential of 71.4% segmented neutrophils, 20.5% lymphocytes, and 7.9% monocytes; and C-reactive protein level of 1.95 mg/ dL (normal range 0-0.3 mg/dL). She was given supplemental oxygen for hypoxia and conservative treatment, with hydration and pain control. The antiviral agents used in other severe MERS-CoV patients were not used in this patient, because her symptoms and laboratory findings were not severe. Also, there was no evidence of any potential harm to the fetus and pregnant woman related to those drugs. After several days, her dyspnea and myalgia improved. The SpO2 was 98% in room air and chest radiography showed interval improvement. On June 19 and 21, MERS-CoV PCR was performed and the results were negative. She had no symptoms related to MERS.",

            "text": "Currently, an exposure time to this virus during pregnancy and a severity of maternal disease could be expected to affect the perinatal outcome. However, there is limited knowledge about the clinical implications of MERS-CoV infection on the maternal, fetal, and placental aspects of pregnancy. From the maternal aspect, there is no epidemiologic data regarding whether pregnant women are more susceptible to MERS. Also, it is unknown whether MERS-CoV infected pregnant women have a more severe disease course compared with the non-pregnant population. In our case, she showed a mild disease course. She had low level of IgG antibody by ELISA and IIFT but not detectable neutralization activity by PRNT. It has been suggested that neutralizing antibodies are produced at low levels and are potentially short-lived after mild or asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection (16, 17) . From the fetal aspect, it is unclear whether MERS was a causative factor in the stillbirth or preterm birth. Fetal specimen and/or placenta were not available for evaluation in the previous cases. As pregnancy alters maternal pulmonary function and consumes more oxygen, severe respiratory illness during pregnancy results in maternal hypoxemia. Maternal hypoxemia can be associated with poor fetal oxygenation, which eventually could lead to preterm birth or stillbirth. Also, altered immune responses during pregnancy could affect the fetal outcome (13) . From the placental aspect, there have been no reports of MERS causing pathology of the placenta including infarction, insufficiency, or villus placentitis. Our case showed placenta abruption clinically, which can be caused by maternal infection. There is no evidence of a relationship between MERS-CoV and placenta disorder. However, the possibility that this virus may be a cause of placenta abruption should be of concern.",

            "text": "Lastly, the remaining question was whether the virus could cross the placenta causing significant infection in the fetus, and whether MERS could cause vertical transmission. Camel-tohuman transmission, and human-to-human transmission via contact, droplet, and possibly airborne routes are the known modes of transmission (18, 19) . However, there are no data about perinatal transmission of MERS-CoV. Moreover, if the mother mounts an appropriate immune response to produce enough neutralizing antibodies without serious conditions, passive antibodies transferred from mother to fetus may have a protective effect on the fetus. There is only one case reporting the mother's serologic data previously (15) , in which stillbirth occurred at approximately 5 months of gestation, although the mother had MERS-CoV antibody by ELISA (titer 1:1,600) , immunofluorescent antibody (IFA), and microneutralization titer assay (titer 1:80). In our case, although the mother had IgG antibody (titer 1:100 by IIFT), antibody was not detected in neonatal serum. This finding may provoke different interpretations in regard to the role of maternal antibodies in the fetus or to transmission of maternal antibodies, necessitating more data in the future. To know whether prenatal transmission of MERS-CoV can occur, collection of samples including amniotic fluid, placenta, and umbilical cord is needed from an infected pregnant patient.",
