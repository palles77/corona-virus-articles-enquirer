            "text": "Spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV) causes high morality in several economically important cyprinid fishes, but there is no approved therapy up to now. To address the urgent need for therapeutics to combat SVCV infection, we investigated the anti-SVCV activities of 12 natural compounds and 7 common antiviral agents using epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells in this study. From the 19 compounds, we identified arctigenin (ARG) has the highest inhibition on SVCV replication, with maximum inhibitory percentage on SVCV > 90%. And the 48 h half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) of ARG on SVCV glycoprotein and nucleoprotein were 0.29 (0.22-0.39) and 0.35 (0.29-0.41) mg/L respectively. In addition, ARG significantly reduced SVCV-induced apoptosis and recovered SVCV-activated caspase-3/8/9 activity. Further, cellular morphological damage induced by SVCV was blocked by ARG treatment. Mechanistically, ARG did not affect SVCV infectivity. Moreover, ARG could not induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which plays an antiviral role on SVCV. Interestingly, SVCV-induced autophagy which is necessary for virus replication was inhibited by ARG treatment. These results indicated that the inhibition of ARG on SVCV replication was, at least in part, via blocking SVCVinduced autophagy. Taken together, ARG has the potential to work as an agent for protecting economically important fishes against SVCV.",

Until now, SVCV has widely spread to Asia, Europe, America and Russia, and this implies that SVCV infection is rapidly expanding along with the increasingly frequent national and international trade (Goodwin, 2002; Dikkeboom et al., 2004; Warg et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2007; Phelps et al., 2012) . Notably, in addition to spread among fish, SVCV infection can also be spread through parasitic and fomites invertebrates (Fijian, 1984; Ahne et al., 2002) . Thus, it is difficult to eradicate the virus from affected ponds, and the only effective treatment to block SVCV infection is elimination and sanitation of all infected aquatic life (Ahne et al., 2002; Shao et al., 2015; Ashraf et al., 2016) .",

In the current study, Annexin V/PI was used for evaluating the anti-apoptotic effect of ARG by measuring the percentage of viable cells and apoptotic cells. As shown in Fig. 3 , SVCV infection caused significant apoptosis in EPC cells, with a large percentage (62.74%) of EPC cells were undergoing early apoptosis at 48 h p.i.

In accordance with pervious study (Yuan et al., 2014) , caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities were significantly upregulated in this study. Importantly, ARG treatment inhibited apoptosis and recovered caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities. This indicated that the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway were both not activated because of the antiviral activity of ARG. Additionally, apoptosis plays a crucial role in host defense against viral infections (Chattopadhyay et al., 2016) . For example, soft-shelled turtle iridovirus and largemouth bass virus induced the occurrence of apoptosis which in turn defensed virus infection in some extent (Huang et al., 2014) . Apoptosis occurred during SVCV infection and ARG treatment could inhibited apoptosis. This indicated that the host cells did not need to induce apoptosis to combat SVCV infection because of the antiviral effect of ARG. The full genome of SVCV, one negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus, contains 5 segments encoding 5 proteins: Glycoprotein, Nucleoprotein, Matrix protein, Phosphoprotein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Glycoprotein is on the surface of the virus and is the most important viral antigenic protein that determines the infectivity and serological properties (Johnson et al., 1999) . Because ARG was highly effective to SVCV, we first speculated if ARG could damage the structure of glycoprotein and affect SVCV infectivity. However, we found that ARG had no effect on SVCV infectivity. This indicated that the structure of glycoprotein cannot be damaged by ARG directly in vitro. Linked with the study of Hayashi et al. (2010) which found the targets of ARG are the early events of influence virus type A replication after penetration into cells, we speculated that the antiviral effect of ARG was most likely due to inhibition effect on one or multiple intracellular replication events of SVCV.",

Thereby, we investigated whether ARG inhibited SVCV replication through activating ROS generation. However, ARG caused a slight reduction of ROS rather than induced ROS generation in EPC cells, which indicated that the antiviral activity of ARG was not due to ROS generation. On the other hand, oxidative stress was confirmed as a mediator of apoptosis in virus-infected cells . In this study, we found that SVCV-induced ROS production was inhibited by ARG treatment, which might be related to the anti-apoptosis effect of ARG. In addition, ROS was known to trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis mediated by caspase-9, in accordance with this, the activated caspase-9 activity was recovered by ARG treatment.",

Some viruses inhibited this pathway for their survival, while others enhanced to benefit this pathway (Sir and Ou, 2010) . SVCV had been found inducing autophagy in EPC cells, which is required for necessary viral replication (Liu et al., 2015b) . Here, we found that the autophagy induced by SVCV was inhibited by ARG treatment. This inhibition on autophagy might be caused by the following two reasons: 1) ARG had a direct effect on autophagy and then inhibited SVCV replication; 2) ARG inhibited SVCV-induced autophagy via suppressing SVCV first. By treating EPC cells with ARG alone, we found that ARG did not inhibit autophagy directly, and thus, its inhibition on SVCV-induced autophagy was mainly caused by the second reason. Since SVCV glycoprotein, rather than viral replication, activates autophagy pathway (Liu et al., 2015b) , it should be important to emphasize that ARG had no effect on SVCV infectivity, which implied ARG could not damage the structure of SVCV glycoprotein. These also indicated that ARG could not inhibit SVCVinduced autophagy directly. Although autophagy was not the primary molecular target of ARG, the inhibition of ARG on SVCV-induced autophagy occurred indeed, and this could be beneficial to the host cell to combat virus infection in some extent.",
