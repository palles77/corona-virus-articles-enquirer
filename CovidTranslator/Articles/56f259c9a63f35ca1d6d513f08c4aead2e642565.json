            "text": "Macroautophagy, more commonly referred to simply as autophagy, is a fundamental cellular process in eukary otes that is essential for responding and adapting to changes in the environment. In its most common form, autophagy involves sequestration of cytosolic material within a doublemembranebound vesicle, termed the autophagosome, and the subsequent fusion of the auto phagosome with endolysosomal vesicles leads to deg radation and recycling of the sequestered substrates. A crucial function of autophagy is to breakdown macro molecules such as proteins to provide amino acids and other factors necessary to generate energy and synth esize new proteins. The ability to capture large material distinguishes this pathway from proteasomal degra dation, making autophagy necessary for maintaining cellular homeostasis in a variety of settings. Many of the substrates found within autophagosomes are those that threaten cell viability, such as damaged organelles, protein aggregates and intracellular pathogens.",

            "text": "Although autophagosomes are detected under steadystate conditions, their generation is increased substantially in response to stressors, of which nutrient deprivation is the best characterized. Depletion of amino acids or growth factors induces autophagy by inhibiting mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a master regulator of metabolism that inhibits the ULK1 autophagy complex through phosphorylation under nutrient replete conditions (BOX 1) . Once freed from inhibition, the ULK1 complex phosphorylates beclin 1 to activate the phosphoinositide 3kinase catalytic subunit type III (PI3KC3) complex 1 , which creates phosphatidyl inositol3phosphate (PtdIns3P)rich subdomains at regions associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), such as the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment or ERmitochondria contact sites 2,3 . PtdIns3Pbinding proteins then recruit the ATG16L1 complex to this autophago some precursor site (known as the isolation membrane) 4 . The ATG16L1 complex anchors the ubiquitin like molecule LC3 to the lipid bilayer by conjugating LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (BOX 1) . Next, the LC3-PE complex mediates membrane tethering and fusion to extend the isolation membrane by recruiting lipids, which are likely to be derived from multiple mem brane sources, including endosomal vesicles harbour ing the transmembrane protein ATG9L1. The growing isolation membrane eventually fuses with itself to form the enclosed doublemembrane structure, and class C vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) and SNARElike proteins mediate fusion with endolysosomal vesicles leading to the degradation and recycling of the contents.",

            "text": "The role of autophagy in immunity Autophagy can eliminate an infectious threat by promoting a form of autophagy termed xenophagy, whereby intracellular pathogens such as viruses, bac teria and proto zoa are trapped within an autophago some and targeted to the lysosome for destruction. Xenophagy depends on adaptor molecules that crosslink pathogens with the autophagy machinery. For instance, sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1; also known as p62), nuclear domain 10 protein NDP52, optineurin (OPTN) and TAX1binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) bind LC3, in con junction with host molecules associated with damaged Salmonellacontaining vacuoles, including ubiquitin and galectin 8 (REF. 5 ). These binding events allow the isola tion membrane to grow around the bacteria, resulting in its sequestration within the autophagosome. One of the most compelling evidence that autophagy is an impor tant cellintrinsic defence mechanism is that many inva sive pathogens encode virulence factors that counteract the pathway, as exemplified by the LC3deconjugating enzyme RavZ secreted by Legionella pneumophila 6 . Also, enteroviruses can use autophagy to provide a membrane coat that enhances celltocell spread 7 .",

            "text": "The generation of the autophagosome is mediated by the sequential activities of three key protein complexes: the ULK1 complex (comprising ULK1, FIP200, ATG13 and ATG101), the phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic subunit type III (PI3KC3) complex (comprising beclin 1, vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34), VPS15 and ATG14L), and the ATG16L1 complex (comprising ATG16L1, ATG5 and ATG12). Inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), such as through nutrient deprivation, allows the ULK1 complex to activate the PI3KC3 complex (see the figure) . Following the creation of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P)-rich regions on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment or other membranes, the ATG16L1 complex is recruited by the PtdIns3P-binding protein WIPI2 to the autophagosome precursor structure (that is, the isolation membrane). The ATG16L1 complex is generated through an ubiquitin-like (UBL) conjugation reaction in which the UBL molecule ATG12 is conjugated to ATG5 by the sequential action of ATG7 and ATG10. ATG16L1 non-covalently binds the ATG5-ATG12 conjugate to form a multimeric complex. In parallel, another UBL molecule, LC3, is processed by the ATG4 protease and subjected to a second UBL conjugation reaction involving ATG7 and ATG3. The ATG16L1 complex conjugates LC3 and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to complete the reaction. LC3-PE mediates membrane tethering and fusion to extend the isolation membrane by recruiting membranes from multiple sources, eventually leading to self-fusion and the formation of the autophagosome. Subsequent fusion with the lysosome, mediated by class C vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) and SNARE-like proteins (not shown), leads to the degradation of the sequestered substrates. Some pathogens are neutralized by non canonical functions of the autophagy machinery, herein referred to as 'noncanonical autophagy' (BOX 2) . For instance, LC3associated phagocytosis (LAP) mediates phagosome maturation and requires many of the same proteins as conventional autophagy, but it occurs independently of autophagosome formation 8 . Another form of non canonical autophagy induced by interferon\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) restricts the replication of norovirus and Toxoplasma gondii in macrophages in a lysosomeindependent man ner [9] [10] [11] . In the case of T. gondii infection, the ATG16L1 complex and LC3 disrupt the parasitophorous vacuole by recruiting the p47 immunityrelated GTPases (IRGs) and the p65 guanylatebinding proteins (GBPs) 9,12-15 . Although it is not always clear whether the classical or an unconventional form of autophagy is involved in host defence, autophagy proteins remain strong candidates as drug targets in infectious disease. Indeed, inducing autophagy with a cellpermeable beclin 1 peptide protects against several pathogens in vitro and in vivo, including chikungunya virus and West Nile virus 16 .",

For example, during Sindbis virus infection, autophagy protects against neuronal cell death without affecting the degree of viral replica tion 17 . Similarly, in the absence of ATG16L1, the benefi cial intestinal virus murine norovirus (MNV) 18 triggers intestinal pathologies in mice through the cytokines tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and IFN\u03b3 19 . Viral rep lication is unaltered in these mice 19 , consistent with a role for autophagy in suppressing the negative impact of inflammatory cytokines produced in responses to an enteric virus. Furthermore, expression of transcrip tion factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal genes, protects Caenorhabditis elegans from Staphylococcus aureus infection by promoting a cytoprotective transcriptional response 20 . Autophagy is also essential for the survival of mice with S. aureus mediated bacteraemia and pneumonia: instead of reducing bacterial burden in these animals, autophagy promotes the viability of endothelial cells in the pres ence of a poreforming toxin produced by widely circu lating methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains 21 . The vulnerability of autophagydeficient endothelial cells is due to an increase in the expression of the toxin receptor ADAM10 at the protein level 21 , indicating that the protein turnover function of autophagy can indi rectly contribute to infectious disease susceptibility. Therapeutically increasing autophagy also improves survival in a mouse model of sepsis by reducing the level of inflammation in the lungs 22 . Thus, in addition to resistance mechanisms aimed at reducing the number of intracellular infectious agents, autophagy facilitates tolerance mechanisms that reduce the adverse effect of an infection 23 .",

ATG5 prevents neutrophil-mediated lung damage during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection independently of the other ATG16L1 complex members, and it is unclear whether this function represents a type of non-canonical autophagy or a new function of ATG5 (REF. 161 ). Coronavirus replication occurs on endoplasmic reticulum-derived membranes decorated by the unconjugated form of LC3 and does not require the rest of the autophagy machinery 162 . ATG9L1 represses DNA stimulation of STING independently of the LC3 conjugation machinery 73 . LC3 can be recruited to double-membrane structures containing internalized Salmonella spp. in the absence of ATG9L1 and subunits of the ULK1 and PI3KC3 complexes 163 , challenging the assumption that the mechanism of autophagy in response to starvation is conserved during xenophagy. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of ATG16L1 on nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) and NOD2 signalling can occur independently of the autophagy function of this protein 164 . CD4 + T cell-mediated recognition of dendritic cells harbouring T. gondii was shown to depend on ATG5 and not ATG7 (REF. 165 ). This finding is unexpected because incorporation of ATG5 into the ATG16L1 complex is dependent on ATG7 and suggests the existence of another unknown function for ATG5 in dendritic cells. These findings collectively indicate that investigating one autophagy protein is insufficient to make conclusions about the role of canonical or non-canonical autophagy in a given immune process.

The NLRP3 inflammasome, for instance, is activated by diverse stimuli that disrupt mitochondrial integrity, including ATP, bacterial toxins and uric acid crystals. Mitophagy, which is a selective form of autophagy that removes damaged mitochondria, inhibits IL1\u03b2 and IL18 production in response to these stimuli by preventing the accumulation of mitochondriaderived DAMPs, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [28] [29] [30] (FIG. 1) . Autophagy also removes or prevents leakage of bacterial prod ucts from Shigella-or Salmonellacontaining vacuoles into the cytoplasm, thereby limiting the detection of microbial factors in the cytosol by the caspase 11 inflammasome 31,32 . This model is consistent with a role for autophagy in repairing damaged pathogen containing vacuoles 33 and with the observation that autophagy prevents pyroptosis in the presence of inva sive bacteria 32, 34, 35 . In addition to these examples, in which autophagy limits the availability in the cytosol of inflammasome activators (such as ROS, mtDNA and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), one study has shown that SQSTM1 can target the inflammasome subunit ASC for incorporation into an autophagosome, leading to its inactivation 36 .

Specifically, cytokine production by myeloid cells in the presence of bacteria or bacterial ligands that acti vate NOD2 is increased in the absence of autophagy proteins [46] [47] [48] [49] . NOD2 also recognizes viral RNA, and subsequent RIP2 signalling induces mitophagy through ULK1 phosphorylation. Consequently, NOD2 or RIP2 deficiency increases ROS production by mitochon dria and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which exacerbates lung inflammation during influenza virus infection 50 . Similarly, NOD2-RIP2 signalling induces autophagy in alveolar macrophages to suppress inflam mation caused by the inflammasome during acute lung injury 51 . Additionally, following internalization of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) derived from the commen sal bac terium Bacteroides fragilis, NOD2 is required for induction of a LAPlike process in dendritic cells (DCs) in the intestine that mediates regulatory T cell (T reg cell) differentiation -a process that prevents an unwanted inflammatory response directed towards the microbiota 52 . Although the mechanistic contribu tion of LAP in this setting remains unclear, this study demonstrates a novel role for non canonical autophagy in suppressing immune responses at barrier sites where microbial encounters are common. Altogether, these studies indicate that a major function of autophagy is to keep the immune system in check by counteracting the proinflammatory functions of NLRs. Autophagy inhibits inflammasome activation by sequestering damaged mitochondria and the NLRP3-binding protein ASC to prevent caspase 1-mediated cleavage of pro-interleukin-1\u03b2 (pro-IL-1\u03b2) and pro-IL-18 into the active forms, as well as to prevent pyroptosis. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) in the cytosol recognizes bacterial peptidoglycan and viral RNA from internalized pathogens and subsequently induces autophagy, either by signalling through receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2) or by directly recruiting ATG16L1 in a complex with immunity-related GTPase family M protein (IRGM). Incorporation of the bacteria into the autophagosome is achieved by LC3-binding proteins, such as sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), optineurin (OPTN) and NDP52, which recognize the damaged vacuole or mitochondrion tagged by ubiquitin and galectin 8 (GAL8). In addition to inhibiting pathogen replication, this process reduces leakage of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the cytosol to prevent activation of the caspase 11 inflammasome. Following LPS-mediated activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MYD88) and TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFN\u03b2 (TRIF) signal through TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and TRAF3 to facilitate autophagy by inducing the K63-linked ubiquitylation and release of beclin 1 from inhibition, through the phosphorylation and activation of OPTN through TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) ubiquitylation, and by inducing nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signalling and transcription of SQSTM1 and the autophagosome maturation protein DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator protein 1 (DRAM1). Recognition of internalized fungal glycans and immune complexes by TLR2 and the Fc\u03b3 receptor (Fc\u03b3R) triggers LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). As the phagosome acidifies, the fungal pathogen is degraded and activates TLR9 to induce signals through interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and type I interferon (IFN) transcription.

In addition, LPS and NF\u03baBinduced SQSTM1 recognizes ubiquitintagged mitochondria to promote mitophagymediated suppres sion of the NLRP3 inflammasome 30 (FIG. 1) . Thus, the induction of SQSTM1 explains why NF\u03baB signalling is sometimes counterintuitively antiinflammatory. TLR4-TRIF activation by Gramnegative bacteria can also induce TRAF3mediated K63 ubiquitylation of TANKbinding kinase 1 (TBK1), which phosphory lates optineurin to increase its binding affinity for LC3, thereby promoting xenophagy by crosslinking LC3 and bacteria bound by OPTN 58 . These studies indicate that pathogen sensing by TLRs triggers multiple signalling events that converge on autophagy.",

When antibodybound DNA complexes are internalized by pDCs and bind Fc\u03b3 receptor (Fc\u03b3R), LAP mediates the maturation of the phagosome to a vesicle that supports type I IFN produc tion downstream of TLR9 (REF. 62 ). The acidification of phago somes containing TLR2 ligands in macrophages also occurs through LAP 63 . Furthermore, melanin in the cell wall of the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumi gatus inhibits ROS production by the NADPH oxidase, which, together with TLR recognition of fungal surface mol ecules, is a necessary step in the recruitment of autophagy proteins to the phagosome. When melanin is removed during A. fumigatus germination, LAP can mediate the degradation of the pathogen by promoting phagosome maturation 8, 64 .

SQSTM1 has a dual function as both an adaptor molecule for autophagy and a scaffolding protein that binds TRAF6 to mediate NF\u03baB signalling downstream of TLRs 65 . In keratinocytes, SQSTM1 is targeted for autophagic degradation through its binding to LC3, thereby disrupting TLR4 and TLR2 signalling 66 . Furthermore, MYD88 signalling upon TLR2 recogni tion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces a microRNA that inhibits autophagy by targeting UVRAG, a subunit of the PI3K3C complex, resulting in increased bacterial survival 67 . However, unlike the extensive antago nistic rela tionship observed between NLRs and autophagy, exam ples of autophagy and TLR antagonism have thus far been rare and may apply to specific cell types or pathogens. Antiviral signalling. Whereas autophagy proteins typically promote TLR signalling in the presence of vesicle bound nucleic acid, autophagy proteins mediate mitophagy to inhibit signalling downstream of cytosolic sensors of viral nucleic acid. The retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIGI)like receptors (RLRs) RIGI and melan oma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5) sense doublestranded RNA in the cytosol and signal through mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS), which oligomerizes on the mitochondrial outer membrane to induce type I IFN expression by activating the transcrip tion factors IRF3 and IRF7. Mitophagy suppresses type I IFN production by removing the platform for RLR sig nalling and causes degradation of signalling inter mediates such as MAVS [68] [69] [70] (FIG. 2a) . ROS produced by accumulat ing mitochondria also contributes to excess type I IFN production when mitophagy is inhibited 71 . When MAVS signalling is triggered by a viral infection, the ATG16L1 complex is recruited to mitochondria by NLR family member X1 (NLRX1), elongation factor Tu, mitochon dria (TUFM) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5B (COX5B) 68, 70 (FIG. 2a) . For this reason, cells deficient in autophagy proteins, NLRX1 or COX5B display enhanced type I IFN production and are better able to restrict the replication of a variety of viruses [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] . Presumably, mito phagy is coupled to the detection of cytosolic RNA to prevent sustained, pathological type I IFN production, but this model has not been formally demonstrated.",

Nuclear HMGB1 regu lates the expression of heat shock protein B1 (HSPB1), a chaperone protein that promotes mitophagy 105 . Also, HMGB1 translocates to the cytosol in the pres ence of ROS, where it induces autophagy by releasing beclin 1 from inhibition by BCL2 (REF. 103 ). Endogenous HMGB1 can also promote autophagy by protecting bec lin 1 and ATG5 from calpainmediated cleavage 106 (FIG. 2e) . Thus, when HMGB1 is removed from macro phages or intestinal epithelial cells, the balance shifts from auto phagy to apoptosis and favours exaggerated cytokine production to increase inflammation 106, 107 .",

The finding that auto phagy is sometimes necessary for type I IFN produc tion (for example, by functioning together with TLRs in pDCs) but can also dampen type I IFN signalling (for example, through mitophagy) reinforces the fact that the relationship between autophagy and a given immune pathway is context dependent. However, one recurring observation is that pathways that induce autophagy are often inhibited by autophagy to prevent sustained activa tion. This negativefeedback loop is most obvious in the presence of inflammasome substrates and viral nucleic acids in the cytosol, where autophagy limits the levels of cytokines produced upon sensing of these molecules.",

A role for auto phagy can be seen in virtually all the cell types that participate in adaptive immunity: lymphocytes, antigen presenting cells (APCs), dying cells and myeloid cells that contribute to the inflammatory milieu. Autophagy, most likely through the removal of damaged mitochon dria, is necessary for the survival and proliferation of CD4 + , CD8 + and NK T cells [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] , memory responses of CD8 + T cells and activated NK cell maintenance 115 Autophagy activity in T cells, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and dying cells affects T cell immunity. Autophagy in APCs such as dendritic cells delivers intracellular and extracellular antigens to endolysosomal vesicles where they are loaded onto MHC class II molecules for presentation to CD4 + T cells. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) in autophagosomes generate citrullinated peptides, thereby affecting the repertoire of antigens being presented. Extracellular antigens can also be delivered to the endosolysosome by LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). Autophagy-mediated release of ATP by dying cells, such as those infected by viruses, leads to engulfment by the APC. Internalized antigens from the dying cell can then be cross-presented on MHC class I molecules (in the endolysosome) to stimulate CD8 + T cells, a process mediated by autophagy or, potentially, LAP downstream of GCN2 activation. By inhibiting the release of key inflammatory cytokines, autophagy decreases the differentiation of CD4 + T cells into T helper 17 (T H 17) cells. Alternatively, exogenous antigens may be exported into the cytosol and delivered to MHC class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). For instance, the removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing mitochondria inhibits calpain-mediated processing of interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1). Naive CD4 + T cells require autophagy for survival and proliferation (and cytokine production once activated). The establishment of memory by CD8 + T cells is also dependent on autophagy.",

Autophagy in virally infected cells generates antigens for presentation to CD4 + T cells by delivering cytosolic proteins to the endolysosome for antigen processing, such as the Epstein-Barr virus pro tein EBNA1 (REF. 130) (FIG. 3) . In some cases, antigens are generated by autophagy from the uptake of ubiquity lated protein aggregates and pathogencontaining vac uoles that are recognized by SQSTM1, which become substrates for either MHC class I or MHC class II pres entation 131, 132 . Autophagy can be augmented to enhance antigen presentation through various signals, such as IFN\u03b3 and NOD2 activation 41, 131, 132 . Autophagy or LAP has also been shown to be crucial for the processing of exogenous antigens in DCs by mediating the fusion of phagosomes containing TLR ligands or apoptotic corpses with lysosomes [133] [134] [135] (FIG. 3) . This process is neces sary for the MHC class II presentation that drives the antiviral T H 1 cell response during HSV2 infection 136 .

One of the first indicators that autophagy dysfunction contributes to inflammatory disease was provided by the genetic link between Crohn disease and a common polymorphism in ATG16L1 (REF. 139 ). The disease polymorphism results in a threonine to alanine coding change (T300A) that destabilizes the ATG16L1 protein product by introducing a caspase 3 cleavage site 48, 49 . The function of autophagy in inhibiting cytokine production is consistent with the idea that Crohn disease stems from an exaggerated immune response directed towards the gut microbiota. Additionally, inhibiting auto phagy within the intestinal epithelium causes defects in antimicrobial granule formation by Paneth cells and reduced mucus secretion by goblet cells 19, [140] [141] [142] . Together with xenophagy, autophagy helps maintain these secre tory cell lineages and prevents breaches of the epithelial barrier by both pathogenic and commensal bacteria 60, 143 . The importance of these epithelial cellspecific func tions of autophagy is supported by the observation that knockin mice harbouring the ATG16L1 T300A disease variant are susceptible to enteric bacterial infections and display defects in Paneth cells and goblet cells 48, 49 . Also, the crosstalk between the ER stress pathway and auto phagy in Paneth cells was shown to have a central role in preventing intestinal inflammation 142 , directly implicat ing the organ elle homeostasis function of autophagy in the function of this secretory cell type.",

A recent study has shown that macrophages derived from patients with NPC1 are unable to perform NOD2mediated xeno phagy 155 . In another example, a mutation in cystic fibro sis transmembrane conductance receptor (CFTR) leads to sequestration of the PI3KC3 complex into protein aggre gates and downregulation of autophagy 156 . This block in autophagy potentially contributes to chronic lung inflam mation and recurring pulmonary infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Indeed, the CFTR mutation increases the susceptibility of macrophages to Burkholderia cenocepacia infection and exacerbates IL1\u03b2 production 157 . Autophagy is further inhibited following treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis with the antibiotic azithromycin and is associ ated with increased infection by nontuberculous mycobacteria 158 . Thus, restoration of autophagy may ameliorate many chronic inflammatory disorders.",

Through these functions, the autophagy machinery controls complex multicellular immune responses at the whole organism level. The literature highlighted in this article reinforces three themes related to how these functions of autophagy are integrated into inflammatory signalling cascades to ensure an appropriate response to environmental threats and a return to homeostasis: one, pathways that induce autophagy are subject to regulation by autophagy; two, autophagy can increase or decrease different parts of the same inflammatory signalling cascade in a contextdependent manner; and three, non canonical autophagy is pervasive. Although these principles apply to the role of autophagy across numerous physiological functions, they are perhaps most obvious in the recent literature examining the function of autophagy proteins in host defence and inflammatory disease.",

Short term induction of autophagy is effective in reducing the burden of intracellular pathogens 16 , and it can simulta neously enhance TLRmediated cytokine production and antigen presentation by DCs to improve adaptive immunity 138 . Treating chronic infections is potentially more challenging and will require consideration of the bidirectional communication between autophagy and inflammation. It is important to bear in mind that the measure of an effective immune response is not how vigorous it is, but how efficiently the threat is neutralized without damaging the host. The successful application of therapeutic intervention may require knowledge of when the role of autophagy in reducing inflammation com plements, rather than inhibits, the role of autophagy in reducing pathogen burden.",

Before considering this strategy, it is important to identify the physiological situations in which the net effect of autophagy on the level of IL1\u03b2, type I IFN and other cytokines is positive ver sus negative. Also, the cell types and organs most affected by autophagy activity should be determined. Although the discovery of noncanonical forms of autophagy has increased the complexity of the field, we may be able to exploit the subtle differences in the function of different components of the autophagy machinery. Indeed, deleting some autophagy genes in macrophages leads to a more pronounced inflammatory outcome than deleting other autophagy genes 25, 151 , perhaps indicating that inhibition of certain parts of the pathway can be compensated by other membranetrafficking processes, and/or that some autophagy proteins have partially redundant functions. It may be possible to target different nodes of the autophagy pathway without broadly affecting all the downstream immune functions of autophagy proteins.",
