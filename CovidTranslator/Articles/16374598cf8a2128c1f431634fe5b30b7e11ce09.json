HIV-human interactions dominate host-pathogen interaction databases (with approximately 2000 interactions) despite the fact that probably none of these interactions have been identified in systematic interaction screens. Recently, combinations of protein interaction data with RNAi and other functional genomics data allowed researchers to model more complex interaction networks. The rapid progress in this area promises a flood of new data in the near future, with clinical applications as soon as structural and functional genomics catches up with next-generation sequencing of human variation and structure-based drug design.",

In particular, a molecular understanding of pathogenesis requires that we know what individual viral proteins do in the cells of their hosts, with whom they interact and what the consequences of these interactions are. While there are thousands of studies of individual viral genes and proteins, this review summarizes our knowledge of virus-host protein-protein interactions and focuses on global attempts to collect and analyze such interactions [5] . 'Global' means that (almost) all proteins of a genome are analyzed. This ensures that all proteins receive the same attention, especially in large viral genomes that may encode hundreds of proteins.",

            "text": "In contrast to viruses that enter their host cells completely and must express all their proteins in the host cell, many bacteria inject only a few effector proteins into their host cells. For example, pathogenic Escherichia coli strains such as O157 encode in the order of 50 effector proteins that are injected into host cells [6] . The challenge here is to identify the bacterial effector proteins. For viruses, we can safely assume that all viral proteins enter the cell. Thus, an important goal of virus studies is to analyze the activity of each protein inside the cell. Initially this can be done by analyzing the effect of viruses on host cell gene expression or metabolism. Such studies are beyond the scope of this review and are reviewed in [7, 8] . We focus on the direct effects of virus proteins on host proteins by means of direct interaction. While it has become relatively straightforward to identify host-virus protein-protein interactions it remains extremely difficult and time-consuming to find out the exact biological role and the molecular mechanisms of such interactions. Because of such difficulties most studies have focused on single viral proteins and their interactions. This approach is still invaluable for the understanding of a protein of interest but it does not provide a global understanding of virus biology (unless many such datapoints are integrated into global models, see below). For example, despite thousands of publications and many thousand protein-protein interactions of HIV and human proteins, we are still far from a complete understanding of HIV biology. Therefore, any method suitable in molecular biology is required to unravel the intricacies of each infection process. Protein interaction analysis is only one strategy that can be, and needs to be, applied to virus-host interactions. The following paragraphs briefly describe the most important methods for interaction analysis and their advantages and disadvantages.",

Maxwell and Frappier have reviewed proteomic studies of virus infections [9] . These studies give us a sense of the changes in protein expression that are caused by a viral infection and, thus, often hint at regulatory roles of virus proteins. For example, if the level of a host protein increases after infection, this indicates that the virus either enhances its transcription, translation or stability. Obviously, the disadvantage is that such observations do not give us much mechanistic insight into the infection process. In order to study the mechanism of virus infection, we need to find the virus and host proteins that interact with each other and with other components of the cell, such as nucleic acids or even metabolites. While MS is not always the best method to detect direct interactions, especially in complex mixtures, it is invaluable to determine the constituents of such mixtures and, thus, often suggests direct interactions.",

They found 253 different human proteins, 33 of which were already known to be virion components. This and other studies are reviewed by Maxwell and Frappier [9] and further summarized in Table 1 . As with the studies mentioned above, such proteomics studies have detected many human proteins in virion particles, although it often remains unclear which virus proteins they interact with and whether these interactions are biologically relevant or just contaminations of the virion preparations. Also, note the substantial discrepancies between multiple studies (Table 1) . For example, while some studies find only a few host proteins associated with virion particles, others find dozens or hundreds.

Although this may give rise to unphysiological levels of protein, elevated expression levels also increase the sensitivity of the Y2H system. Obviously, the physiological significance of each Y2H interaction has to be worked out under conditions reflecting a 'real' infection.

While thousands of host-virus interactions have been collected over the past decade or so, most of them have been found in individual screens and small-scale studies. Per interaction, such data is more valuable than the large-scale screens because single interactions are usually verified and their biological significance evaluated. However, these papers often do not report interactions that have been found in screens but were not further analyzed. In addition, small-scale screens tend to focus on well-known proteins and neglect proteins of unknown significance. At least for some viruses, small-scale screens have accumulated massive amounts of data. This is immedidately evident from the most comprehensively investigated virus, HIV. In order to collect the 2589 unique HIV-human interactions documented in the HIV-human protein interaction database at the NCBI [19] , a total of 14,312 references were collated to obtain these interactions and, even more importantly, to validate them and study their biological significance. This is even more striking when the small size of the HIV genome is considered, which encodes only nine proteins.

Each of these biclusters contained between two and 40 enriched gene ontology terms among their human targets. This clearly shows that most, if not all, pathogens target very specific pathways within their host cells.",

These findings confirm previous observations that chronic infection by HCV is associated with insulin resistance. Similarly, TGF-\u03b2 plays an important role in the maintaining cell growth and differentiation of the liver, the main target of HCV. Accordingly, the TGF-\u03b2 response appears to be impaired in HCV infection.",
