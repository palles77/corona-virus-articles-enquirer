A rapid influenza test and Mycoplasma antigen test using a nasopharyngeal specimen were negative, as were the urine antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella spp. A beta-D glucan and Aspergillus antigen test were both negative. An anti-HIV antibody was negative. Chest X-ray showed bilateral consolidation with air bronchogram (Fig. 2a) . Chest computed tomography showed bilateral pleural effusion, bilateral consolidation with air bronchogram, and ground-glass opacities in her left lung (Fig. 2b, c) . Left ventricular motion on transthoracic echocardiography was normal with an ejection fraction of 65%.",

Prednisolone 40 mg daily was started from hospital day 4, after which her respiratory condition and infiltration on chest X-ray improved (Fig. 3a) .

We performed a multiplex, real-time polymerase chain reaction using an FTD Resp 21 Kit and FTD Legionella Kit (Fast Track Diagnostics, Silema, Malta), which can detect influenza virus, human rhinovirus, human coronavirus, human parainfluenza virus 1-4, human metapneumovirus A/B, HBoV, human syncytial virus A/B, human adenovirus, enterovirus, human parechovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila and L. longbeachae, although only HBoV was detected. Repeated blood cultures during admission were all negative. During the convalescent phase, specific antibody titers against M. pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Chlamydophila pneumoniae, C. psittaci, influenza virus, adenovirus, RSV, and human parainfluenza virus did not increase significantly. We therefore diagnosed her with primary viral pneumonia due to HBoV.",

            "text": "HBoV is predominantly found in respiratory secretions, and prevalence studies have indicated that it is found primarily in respiratory secretions from children with acute respiratory illnesses, at a rate of 2% to 20% (4). Although found throughout the year, primary HBoV infection predominantly occurs in the winter and spring, as do many other respiratory infections. Evidence accumulated since 2005 supports HBoV as a genuine human pathogen causing mild to severe respiratory tract infections that especially target children (5) . Risk factors for severe HBoV1-associated illnesses include underlying chronic medical conditions, such as cardiac or pulmonary disease, prematurity with chronic lung disease, cancer, and immunosuppression (6); however, our patient had none of these conditions. HBoV is detected in nasopharyngeal specimens in about 0-8.6% of asymptomatic children (7). Our hospital did not detect HBoV from BAL fluid in any of 50 asymptomatic adults (unpublished data), indicating the rarity of HBoV detection in BAL fluid from asymptomatic adults. Another study showed that HBoV DNA is rarely detected in respiratory samples of adult patients over 65 years of age with or without a respiratory tract infection (6) . Other studies have shown HBoV DNA to be common in tonsillar tissue taken from children with hypertrophic tonsils (8) . However, our patient was already intubated when BAL was performed, so the possibility of contamination by viruses colonizing the nasopharyngeal region can be ruled out. Although HBoV infection frequently involves coinfection with other patho-gens (9), our patient had a positive result only for HBoV, and we thus considered her to have primary viral pneumonia.",
