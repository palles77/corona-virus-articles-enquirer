Previously, potent primer-dependent RdRp activity has been demonstrated for the homologous polymerase subunit (nsp12) of the distantly related coronaviruses. The only previous study focusing on the in vitro activity of nsp9 of an arterivirus (equine arteritis virus; EAV) reported weak de novo polymerase activity on homopolymeric RNA templates. However, this activity was not retained when Mn 2 \u00fe ions were omitted from the assay or when biologically relevant templates were supplied, which prompted us to revisit the biochemical properties of this polymerase. Based on the properties of active-site mutants, we conclude that the RNA-synthesizing activities observed in de novo and primer-dependent polymerase and terminal transferase assays cannot be attributed to recombinant EAV nsp9-RdRp. Our results illustrate the potential pitfalls of characterizing polymerases using highly sensitive biochemical assays.",

Reflecting the principal differentiation into DNA-and RNA-based processes and functions, they can be grouped into four classes, each possessing a distinct combination of specificities for their substrate (NTPs or dNTPs) and template (RNA or DNA) under physiological conditions. Despite these fundamental differences in terms of substrate requirements, many polymerases in these four classes, including all characterized RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), employ the same catalytic mechanism and a similar threedimensional fold, which resembles the shape of a right hand with finger, thumb, and palm domains (Iyer et al., 2003; Ng et al., 2008) . At the sequence level, these polymerases share motifs A and C, which reside in the most conserved palm domain (Delarue et al., 1990) . A few conserved residues, primarily aspartates, located in these motifs are involved in (d)NTP binding and/or catalysis (Arnold et al., 2005; Arnold and Cameron, 2004 ) and consequently their replacement should abolish or at least severely decrease nucleic acid synthesis (Ng et al., 2008) .",

The latter, to our knowledge exclusively (DNA-or RNA-dependent) RNA polymerases, are capable of positioning the first two NTPs, typically two purines, in a manner that allows the formation of a starting dinucleotide. In contrast, primer-dependent polymerases are unable to accommodate the stable association between the first (d)NTP and the template that is required for de novo initiation. Consequently, the formation of a first dinucleotide is an energetically extremely unfavorable event and to overcome this problem short RNA primers must be recruited, placed on the template, and extended. For this purpose, organisms and viruses have evolved different priming mechanisms that are all supported by additional proteins or domains. They may involve the synthesis of short RNA fragments (by e.g. eukaryotic DNA primase (Pellegrini, 2012) ), the formation of covalent RNA-protein complexes (e.g. picornavirus VPg-RNA complexes (Steil and Barton, 2009 )), or the utilization of tRNAs (by lentivirus tRNA-binding domains (Kleiman, 2002) ) or capbearing 5 0 fragments cleaved from cellular mRNAs (generated by influenza virus, bunyavirus, and arenavirus endoribonuclease and cap-binding domains (Boivin et al., 2010; Morin et al., 2010; Reguera et al., 2010) ).",

            "text": "In viruses of the order Nidovirales (comprising the families Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae, Mesoniviridae, and Roniviridae), which are characterized by their large to exceptionally large singlestranded RNA genomes (de Groot et al., 2012; Lauber et al., 2012), a canonical RdRp is expressed from ORF1b as part of the pp1ab replicase polyprotein. After proteolytic cleavage, a protein subunit (nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9) in Arteriviridae, nsp12 in Coronaviridae) harboring conserved RdRp motifs in its C-terminal two-thirds is released (Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Lauber et al., 2012; Lehmann et al., 2015; van Dinten et al., 1996; Ziebuhr and Siddell, 1999) . This cleavage product is a key subunit of the membraneassociated multi-subunit enzyme complex that mediates the synthesis of diverse viral RNAs (Sawicki et al., 2007; van Hemert et al., 2008a; van Hemert et al., 2008b) . This complex has been characterized in situ and through reconstitution of its activities in vitro. In one of these studies severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was proposed to express a second, noncanonical RNA polymerase subunit: the ORF1a-encoded nsp8 (Imbert et al., 2006) , which was described as an obligatory de novo-initiating polymerase capable of synthesizing products of less than six nucleotides (Imbert et al., 2006) . Since nsp12 was found to be primer-dependent (te Velthuis et al., 2010a) , it was speculated that the two proteins may work sequentially on the same template, with nsp8 providing the primers required by the nsp12 \"main RdRp\". Although supported by some biochemical studies on nsp8 of other coronaviruses (Xiao et al., 2012) , other results called into question this clear division of labor between nsp8 and nsp12 (te Velthuis et al., 2012; Ahn et al., 2012) . Most recently, the addition of nsp7 and nsp8 was shown to activate the primer extension activity of SARS-CoV nsp12 in an in vitro assay (Subissi et al., 2014) . The same protein combination was required for de novo initiation of RNA synthesis. The nsp7-nsp8 complex by itself, on the other hand, did not show any polymerase activity and was therefore proposed to serve as an activator and processivity factor for the nsp12 RdRp.",

In that study, weak de novo RdRp activity was reported on poly-uridine (pU) and poly-cytidine (pC) single-stranded RNAs, while no primer extension or terminal transferase activity, i.e. the non-templated elongation of RNA strands, was detected. Thus, it was concluded that EAV nsp9 activity is restricted to de novo initiation. However, the relevance of the observed activity for virus replication remained uncertain since activity on templates containing appropriate virusspecific sequences could not be detected and the in vitro activity required the presence of Mn 2 \u00fe , which is known to relieve template requirements for other polymerases . One possible explanation for the lack of initiation on virus-specific templates could be that additional co-factors, e.g. higher-order RNA structures or proteins, are needed for genuine de novo initiation in vivo. Therefore the aim of this study was to characterize the RNA polymerase activity of EAV nsp9 in more detail. We report the results of a carefully controlled study involving several preparations of purified recombinant EAV nsp9, including the wild-type protein and a set of active-site mutants, which were tested for de novo and primer-dependent polymerase and terminal transferase activities. However, the RdRp domain of recombinant EAV nsp9 did not specifically display any of these activities and we were thus unable to reproduce the published polymerase activity of the protein. Furthermore, we noticed a striking resemblance between the product profile of one of the tested nsp9 preparations and that of T7 phage RNA polymerase. Our results emphasize the need to employ diverse controls when utilizing highly sensitive biochemical assays.",

In that study the viral protein (which will be referred to as nsp9/pDEST) was expressed from a pDEST vector with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Typically, an unknown fraction of such bacterially expressed proteins may contain an N-terminal formylmethionine, due to saturation of the endogenous protein processing pathway by nsp9 overexpression. Such an N-terminal extension would not be consistent with the authentic N-terminus of nsp9, which is expected to be a glycine residue derived from the proteolytic release of nsp9 from the pp1ab polyprotein by nsp4-mediated cleavage of the Glu1677\u2193Gly1678 site . As it was previously reported for SARS-CoV nsp8 and nsp12 that such foreign N-terminal sequences may influence RdRp activity and stability, respectively (te Velthuis et al., 2010a Velthuis et al., , 2012 , we decided to also express EAV nsp9 as part of a ubiquitin fusion protein by using a pASK vector (Gohara et al., 1999; te Velthuis et al., 2010a ) yielding a product that will hereafter be referred to as nsp9/pASK. Co-expression of the ubiquitinspecific protease UBP1, which can remove the N-terminal ubiquitin fusion partner in bacterio, enabled us to reproduce the natural glycine N-terminus of nsp9. An additional advantage of the pASK vector is that it allows expression to be driven by the endogenous pool of E. coli RNA polymerase after induction with anhydrotetracycline. In contrast, nsp9/pDEST was expressed from a T7 promoter. The potential presence of the phage T7 RNA polymerase in the ultimate nsp9 preparations, with previously demonstrated weak RdRp activity (Beerens et al., 2007) , could be of concern.",

The only noteworthy difference was the length of the pU template, which was 30 nucleotides in our experiments compared to an undefined mixture containing RNAs of up to 300 nucleotides in the study of Beerens et al. Unfortunately, neither of the nsp9 variants showed any activity on this template. Next, we tested for RdRp activity using a template whose 3 0 -terminal dinucleotide matched the CC dinucleotide that is present immediately upstream of the poly(A) tail at the 3 0 end of the EAV genome. Indeed, as previously shown for homopolymeric pC templates, nsp9/pDEST exhibited some activity with this RNA template, while nsp9/pASK remained essentially inactive (Fig. 1B , middle and left panel, respectively, lanes R 1 ).",

To test this hypothesis, we included a highly diluted sample (0.01 U/ml final concentration) of a commercially available T7 RNA polymerase in our assays. Since this enzyme is DNA-dependent, we included two single-stranded DNA templates: a DNA variant (D 1 ) of the RNA template used and a DNA template containing the complement of the T7 promoter sequence (D 4 ) . Surprisingly, T7 RNA polymerase was active on all of these templates under the employed conditions (Fig. 1B , right panel) with the expected preference for DNA templates.",

Hence, this circumstantial evidence suggested that contaminating T7 RNA polymerase, rather than EAV nsp9 itself, was responsible for the de novo polymerase activity observed. We investigated whether a gel filtration step with a low flow rate (0.3 ml/min) would remove the suspected trace contamination of T7 RNA polymerase (molecular weight 99 kDa) from a preparation of nsp9/pDEST (molecular weight 78 kDa), but this was not found to be the case (data not shown).",

This polymerase was also able to act on templates lacking the established T7 promoter requirements. Whether or not this contamination was also present in the nsp9 preparations described in Beerens et al. (2007) , and later on also by te Velthuis et al. (2010b) , cannot be established with certainty as the experiments presented here and those published previously differed in some respects. Particularly the previously used purification protocol could not be reproduced in our experiments due to technical difficulties with the described purification buffer, which in our hands induced protein precipitation during purification. Also, the fact that we did not detect any RdRp activity for nsp9/pDEST on a pU template, and therefore also not for any potential contaminant, may argue in favor of the detection of genuine nsp9 activity in those previous studies. In this context, it is noteworthy that thus far the two reported coronavirus RdRp activities (associated with nsp8 and nsp12) were addressed in six independent biochemical studies (Ahn et al., 2012; Imbert et al., 2006; Subissi et al., 2014; te Velthuis et al., 2010a te Velthuis et al., , 2012 Xiao et al., 2012) , none of which succeeded in exactly reproducing the results of any of the others.

We used a similar assay as the one described above, but this time provided partially double-stranded templates. We found that both nsp9 preparations were enzymatically active on these templates and showed the highest extension activity if both the template and primer were RNAs (Fig. 1C, left and middle panel) . The impact of the type of substrate showed that the observed activity correlated directly with the addition of nucleic acid substrates, hence was not based on a co-purified E. coli-derived RNA or DNA substrate. Furthermore, as the presence of a DNA template significantly decreased processivity, it also demonstrated that the responsible polymerase was RNA dependent. Interestingly, while the use of a DNA primer in combination with an RNA template completely precluded extension of the primer (no products in the 20-39 nucleotide size range), a radiolabeled 40-nucleotide product was detected. This suggested that the polymerase possessed terminal transferase activity, but only on RNA substrates. To investigate this further, we also compared the elongation of singlestranded RNA and DNA substrates in an assay otherwise identical to the one used for measuring primer-dependent polymerase activity (Fig. 1D ). As expected, both nsp9 preparations showed a clear selectivity in favor of RNA. In this context, it is also noteworthy that neither the primer extension nor the terminal transferase assay buffer included Mn 2 \u00fe ions, which can favor activity on sub-optimal templates . Together with the demonstrated DNA specificity of T7 RNA polymerase ( Fig. 1C and D, right panels) this supports the reliability of these assays with respect to reproducing physiologically relevant substrate preferences.",

As expected, addition of ATP enabled the synthesis of almost fully extended products, while dATP did not support any extension beyond one or two nucleotides (Fig. 2C ). In agreement with the lack of DNA primer extension and the known inability of the prototypic poliovirus RdRp to further extend deoxynucleotide chains (Arnold and Cameron, 2004; Gohara et al., 2000) , we thus conclude that the observed activity originated from an RNAdependent RNA polymerase.",

In contrast to other catalytic mechanisms, which may feature a single or a few absolutely required residues, these individual amino acids work in concert during metal catalysis to provide a framework for metal ions and substrates to bind. Consequently, instead of abolishing all activity, the substitution of single residues in the active site of an RdRp may merely reduce these binding affinities. Thus, depending on the individual contribution of a residue, such replacements may be more or less detrimental to the enzyme's function, and consequently to virus viability.",

Using a full-length cDNA clone, we engineered EAV nsp9 mutants with alanine substitutions of each of the four conserved aspartates of motifs A (mutants D445A, D450A and double mutant D445A/D450A) and C (mutant D560A and double mutant D559A/D560A), which in better characterized polymerases are known to coordinate the essential metal ions or interact with the NTP's 2 0 and 3 0 hydroxyl groups. In agreement with their expected essential role, and with our preliminary observations for equivalent SARS-CoV nsp12 mutants (unpublished data), each of the aspartate-to-alanine substitutions tested had a severe impact on viral replication. Whereas all double mutations tested were lethal, viruses carrying single mutations apparently retained a low level of RNA synthesis, ultimately leading to reversion to the wildtype genome sequence later in the experiment (by 48 h p.t.; see also Supplementary Table S2 ). In all cases, a single point mutation was sufficient to restore the codon for the wild-type residue. Nevertheless, the results were somewhat unexpected given the universal conservation of all four aspartates in positive-stranded RNA virus RdRps. To our knowledge replication of mutants with a single replacement of these active site residues, even though severely decreased and undetectable until reversion had occurred, has not been reported for any other RNA virus thus far.",

None of the double, triple, or quadruple aspartate-to-alanine substitutions tested showed a decreased primer extension activity compared to two independently purified batches of wild-type recombinant nsp9/pASK (Fig. 3) . Likewise, D445A and D560A mutant proteins retained terminal transferase activity (data not shown). Thus, the observed activities either derived from a second active site within nsp9, which was not targeted by mutagenesis, or originated from a different (contaminating) protein altogether. To discriminate between these possibilities, we tested whether it was Fig. 1 . Expression, purification, and RNA polymerase activities of two recombinant EAV nsp9-His preparations.

To this end, the wash steps of the previously established purification protocol were modified in either of two ways; first, a decreasing salt gradient was introduced to weaken (disrupt) hydrophobic interactions between a contaminant and nsp9, and second, an increasing imidazole concentration was employed in order to eliminate any contaminant from the Co 2 \u00fe -resin. As shown in Fig. 4 , the NaCl elution fraction and wash steps 2 and 3 of the imidazole gradient contained almost identical amounts of nsp9-His, as judged by SDS-PAGE, while two of these three fractions were inactive in the polymerase assay. This partial correlation between the presence of recombinant nsp9-His and primer extension activity could be due to either the presence of two forms of nsp9, enzymatically active and defective, or the presence of a second enzyme responsible for the activity. Although the nature and origin of the possible heterogeneity of nsp9 remains elusive, a candidate protein from E. coli that may account at least for the contaminating terminal transferase activity is polyA polymerase I (PAP I), which has been reported to add a polyA tail to RNA substrates in a template-independent manner in vitro (Yehudai-Resheff and Schuster, 2000) . Whether or not this enzyme or other E. coli terminal transferases would also be capable to extend primers in a template-dependent manner is, to our knowledge, currently unknown, but seems unlikely given PAP I's physiological role.",

One possibility is that the activity depends on the presence of one or more (viral) protein cofactor(s) or specific RNA sequences that we have not been able to identify thus far, despite attempts to supplement RdRp assays with several small products from the nsp6-8 region (not shown). While the reasons underlying the differences with earlier studies on nsp9 remain to be elucidated, the outcome of the present study emphasizes the need for designing proper controls, especially when utilizing highly sensitive biochemical assays for the characterization of enzymes with low activity. Furthermore, it illustrates that in vitro assays may reveal activities that are not biologically relevant under physiological conditions or in the presence of interaction partners that may alter substrate preferences by modifying an enzyme's conformation. Being aware of these pitfalls probably is one of the most fundamental prerequisites for the deduction of biological roles from biochemical assays.",
