The results show that 0.05 TCID 50 of HCoV-229E and 0.01 TCID 50 of HCoV-OC43 can be detected by this molecular method using the original method. Detection of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 in clinical specimens is possible using this method: 348 respiratory specimens (202 sputum and 146 nasal aspirates) were tested with this RT-PCR-hybridization and 12 human coronavirus are detected (3%). The method could provide a useful tool for demonstrating the role of human coronavirus in infections of the respiratory tract.",

Apart from rhinitis, human coronavirus is associated with more severe pul-monary infection (Myint, 1994) . As for other respiratory viruses (influenza viruses, rhinoviruses), they are associated with bronchitic hyperactivity even in non-atopic patients (Trigg et al., 1996; Freymuth et al., 1999) . Epidemiological inquiries have led to the conclusion that these viruses circulate widely in seasonal oubreaks.",

Since many studies show that DNA Enzyme Immunoassay (DEIA) is superior to gel electrophoresis for detection of PCR amplicons, and as it has been shown by experience gained with different probes used in this system that absorbance values greater than the cut-off indicate that specific hybridization has taken place, we consider as positive a negative gel electrophoresis associated with a hybridization index \\ 1 (Freymuth et al., 1995; Garcia et al., 1995; Levy et al., 1996; Cantaloube et al., 1997) . Fig. 1 shows that DNA Enzyme Immunoassay (GEN-ETI-K DEIA, Sorin) increases the sensitivity of the detection of the HCoV RNA. After extraction of tenfold dilutions of a HCoV-OC43 viral suspension, the results of RT-PCR using primers defined in M gene (MF1, MF2) show that the viral suspension and first dilution (10 \u2212 1 ) are positive by gel detection and that the hybridization index is greater than 1. For the 10 \u2212 2 dilution, no band was detected on the agarose gel when the hybridization index was positive and equal to four. The positivity of this detection was confirmed by the vizualization of a band at the right position (169 pb) resulting from the heminested RT-PCR using primers MF1, MF2, and MF3. The analytic sensitivity of the RT-PCR-EIA molecular method was determined by considering that the highest positive dilution represents the limit of detection. Since the infectious titer of the viral suspension is known, it is possible to deduce the correlation between the limit of molecular detection and the infectious titer (TCID 50 ).",

Electron microscopy is not a sensitive technique, and it requires an experienced technician. In respiratory samples, images of coronavirus are very hard to differentiate from other cellular structures. Search of intracellular viral antigen by direct immunofluorescence on respiratory cells is disappointing, and many diagnostic laboratories do not undertake this test. In our laboratory, only one marketed antibody (PIV-11646, Arg\u00e8ne France) was used between 1996 and 1999 for the systemic search of coronavirus 229E in nasal aspirates sampled from hospitalised children, and bronchoalveolar liquids (BAL) from hospitalised adults. Among the 7120 tests done, only six samples (five bronchoalveolar liquid and one nasal aspirate) were found positive for HCoV-229E (data not shown). The sensitivity of this antibody has not been defined in viral diagnosis and it is possible that the epitopes recognized are only slightly or not expressed by the cells infected by the wild-type HCoV-229E. Furthermore, the specificity of that monoclonal antibody is not defined. In order to validate the results of immunofluorescence and to devise a diagnostic method for respiratory samples, we have developed a detection system by RT-PCR-hybridization, sensitive and specific. The use of nested PCR, similar to that published in the literature has been discarded because of the high comtamination risk that it represents when many samples are tested. Each amplified PCR product is submitted to a molecular hybridization that uses a specific probe recognising HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43, thus on one hand allowing a control of its specificity, and on the other hand an increase of its sensitivity.",

These are concordant with the recent results of Nokso-Koivisto et al. (2000) . These researchers were looking for 229E and OC43 coronavirus in many samples (1474 nasal aspirates and 391 medium ear sample) that came from a prospective cohort of 2-month old children, followed over a period of 24 months and sampled during each infectious episode. The method used was a RT-PCR duplex HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, followed by a molecular hybridization on microplates. The primers are localised in the gene of the N nucleocapside protein and are different from those used in this study. The results show that the coronavirus was found in 2.6% of the samples (46 in total, 21 HCoV-OC43 and 25",

In order to compare the sensitivity of the different molecular methods described for the detection of coronaviruses 229E and OC43, it is advisable to apply in parallel many respiratory specimens since the percentage of positive samples found in the studies is low, around 3%. It is also necessary to correlate those results with the clinical signs presented by the patients, and to study controls without respiratory clinical signs.",

The molecular technique of detection defined in this study has numerous advantages: it is simple to carry out, its analytical sensitivity on the prototype strains is high and the localisation of the primers in the M protein gene is useful.",
