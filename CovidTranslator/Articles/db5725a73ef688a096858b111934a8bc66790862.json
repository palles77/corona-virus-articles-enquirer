Cauliflower cultivars 'H41' and 'H69' are tolerant to high temperature and flooding, respectively; however, 'H71' is sensitive to both stresses. The objectives of this study were to identify the proteins that were differentially regulated and the physiological changes that occurred during different time periods in 'H41', 'H69', and 'H71' when responding to treatments of flooding, 40 \u2022 C, and both stresses combined. Changes in the leaf proteome were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and identified by Mascot peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) and database searching. Stress treatments caused significant reductions in electrolyte leakage, chlorophyll fluorescence Fv/Fm, chlorophyll content, and water potential as stress times were prolonged. By the comparative proteomic analysis, 85 protein peaks that were differentially expressed in response to combination treatments at 0, 6, and 24 h, 69 (33 in 'H41', 29 in 'H69', and 9 in 'H71') were identified, of which were cultivar specific. Differentially regulated proteins predominantly functioned in photosynthesis and to a lesser extent in energy metabolism, cellular homeostasis, transcription and translation, signal transduction, and protein biosynthesis. This is the first report that utilizes proteomics to discover changes in the protein expression profile of cauliflower in response to heat and flooding.",

            "text": "Cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis), a member of the Brassicaceae family, is an economically and nutritionally important cole crop. The optimum mean temperature range for growing cauliflower is 18-25 \u2022 C. High temperatures cause cauliflower to form uneven and loose heads, puffy buds, yellow eyes and leaves in the head, narrow leaves, reduced leaf growth, delayed initiation of heading, and increased petiole-to-blade ratio, all of which lower the quality of or even make the heads unmarketable (Wurr et al., 1996; Nowbuth and Pearson, 1998) . However, heat-tolerant cultivars are able to form heads at mean temperatures higher than 25 \u2022 C. To expand the area of food production, crops are grown under stressful environments that likely lead to lower yields. The main contributing factors in the reduction of yield and quality in these areas are variations in climatic conditions such as flooding caused by rains (Lin et al., 2010) . Heavy rainstorms and standing water can leave soils saturated for days before draining, making waterlogging a problem in many parts of the world. Air pockets in the soil become filled with water during saturation, thus creating hypoxic conditions followed by anoxia. Flooding causes oxygen starvation, which is a consequence of the relatively slow diffusion of gases in water and from oxygen consumption by plant roots (Takeshi and Julia, 2004) . Rapid leaf chlorosis is seen when cauliflower is subjected to waterlogging (Shih et al., 2013) . Flooding from large rainfall events is a major risk to fresh-market cauliflower production in Taiwan, and most cauliflower cultivars are unable to tolerate flooding during typhoon-caused heavy summer rains. Waterlogging and increasing temperatures associated with global warming are a growing concern, as they limit plant growth and productivity, especially in temperate species. Over the past decade in the tropics and subtropics, there have been considerable increases in production because of the availability of new, tropically adapted cultivars, resulting in increased farmer incomes.",

The physiological mechanisms of HF tolerance are extensively studied in various plant species; however, our current understanding of the molecular biology of acquired tolerances to high temperature and waterlogging are still limited, and relatively little is known about proteins that are critical for controlling these dual mechanisms (Wahid et al., 2007) . Understanding these processes requires the identification and analysis of major proteins that underlie stress-regulatory networks. Plant adaptations to environmental stresses depend on the activation of cascades of molecular networks involved in stress perception, signal transduction, and the expression of stress-related proteins. Knowledge of HF-responsive proteins is critical for further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance. Plants respond to stress in part by modulating protein regulation, which eventually leads to restoration of cellular homeostasis, neutralization of toxins, and recovery of growth. However, there are no reports on the effect of HF stresses on the functioning of cauliflower. Proteins are the direct effectors of the response of plants to stress. They not only include enzymes that mediate changes in the levels of metabolites but also serve as components of the transcription and translation machinery.",

            "text": "In recent years, methods for analyzing the proteome have advanced considerably, and together with emerging sequence information in crops, plant proteomics has become increasingly useful for understanding gene functioning and networks in response to environmental stimuli. Proteomics is a powerful tool for the quantitative analyses of different biochemical pathways including plant stress-related responses. Comparative proteomic analyses of plants subjected to specific stress conditions allow the exploration of various defense-related mechanisms. For instance, proteomics approaches for the comparative analysis of protein abundance between untreated and stress-treated or tolerant and intolerant rice plants have greatly facilitated the study of plant cellular stress responses (Komatsu et al., 2003) . Therefore, identifying novel proteins and studying their differential display patterns in response to HF stresses will provide the molecular and physiological bases for improving tolerance to HF by cauliflowers. Understanding the basis of HF stress signaling and tolerance mechanisms in cauliflowers is required for engineering local cauliflower genotypes that are more tolerant to heat and flood stressing. This goal can be achieved by deciphering the physiological and proteomic responses of cauliflower genotypes, heat-tolerant 'H41', flood-tolerant 'H69', and HF-sensitive 'H71' to flood stress at 40 \u2022 C. The objective of this study was to identify the leaf proteins that are differentially regulated in response to HF stress using a Pro-teomeLab PF-2D aided by improved databases. Our hypothesis was that both HF stresses trigger plant responses that result in quantifiable changes in the proteins of 'H41', 'H69', and 'H71'. Proteomic characterization and functional analysis should facilitate a better understanding of the HF response mechanisms in Brassica so that effective strategies for the genetic improvement of HF-tolerant plant cultivars can be established. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published reports addressing the identification of HFresponsive proteins in Brassica using a proteomic approach.",

Plant materials, culturing, and heat-and flood-stress treatments Seeds of cauliflower (B. oleracea var. botrytis) 'H41', 'H69', and 'H71' were obtained from Chin-Long Seed Co. (Tainan, Taiwan). 'H41' is a heat-tolerant cultivar used especially in warm-subtropical regions such as southern Taiwan, where average day temperatures reach as high as 40 \u2022 C during the summer (June-August). 'H69' is a popular cultivar grown in Taiwan and is flood-tolerant during the rainy season, particularly in rain-fed lowlands. 'H71' is a heat-and flood-sensitive cultivar, and mostly grown during winter in Taiwan due to its cold tolerance. Seeds were sterilized with 1.5% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite, rinsed with distilled-deionized (dd) H 2 O, and sown in a commercial potting soil mixture, and germinated seedlings were transplanted into 12.7-cm diameter plastic pots and raised in a growth chamber under 300 mol m \u22122 s \u22121 light with a 14 h photoperiod and 22/18 \u2022 C day/night temperatures at a relative humidity (RH) of 80%. Plants were watered three times a week and fertilizer (17:36:39, N:P:K) applied once a week to maintain optimal growth for 30 days before the imposition of stress treatments. Pots containing 'H41' and 'H69' plants were subjected to four treatments: non-flooding at 20 \u2022 C (NFC, as control), flooding at 20 \u2022 C (FC, control temperature), non-flooding at 40 \u2022 C (NFH, high temperature), and flooding at 40 \u2022 C (FH), for periods of 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h in four growth chambers having a 14 h photoperiod at 300 mol m \u22122 s \u22121 radiation and 80% RH (Lin et al., 2010) . In the case of flooding treatments, pots were randomly placed in 28 cm \u00d7 14 cm \u00d7 14 cm plastic buckets and subjected to flooding by filling the buckets with tap water to 5 cm above the soil surface. Pots were removed from the buckets at different times following flooding, and plants were removed and their leaves from each plant clipped, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C in an ultrafreezer until used. Three replicates of each time period for the four treatments were randomly placed in a growth chamber. The experiment was performed twice independently in a randomized design for growth environment, sampling day, and physiological analyses.",

In the first dimension, proteins were bound to a strong anion exchanger and eluted with a continuously decreasing pH from 8.0 to 4.0. Fractions were collected at pH intervals of 0.3 in a 96 deepwell plate. Proteins eluted in the gradient were then separated in the second dimension using High Performance Reversed Phase (HPRP) chromatography. Fractions were separated from the second dimension with an RP-HPLC column using two solvents: 0.1% trifluroracetic acid (TFA) in HPLC water (Solvent A) and 0.08% TFA in acetonitrile (ACN) (Solvent B) (Lee et al., 2008) . Separation was performed at 50 \u2022 C with a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min and protein fractions were detected by UV absorbance at 214 nm. Equilibration was achieved with Solvent A for 10 min followed by Solvent B for 5 min prior to each injection. From the selected first dimension fractions, 0.2 ml were injected, run for 2 min, and the column eluted with a linear gradient of 0-100% Solvent B for 25 min. Thereafter, Solvent B was continued for 5 min, followed by re-equilibration with 100% Solvent A for 10 min (Irar et al., 2010) . Fractions from the second dimension were analyzed with Karat TM Version 7.0 (Beckman Coulter). Protein extraction and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) were carried out on three independent technical replicas of the bulk samples.",

In general, the changes in plant physiology were greater under the combined treatment than under heating or flooding alone. The differences in responses to flood and heat in Fv/Fm, CC, EL, and WP seen between cultivars suggested that the three genotypes have unique mechanisms for coping with environmental stresses. The heat-tolerant 'H41' genotype showed significantly higher Fv/Fm, CC, and WP values (Tables 1, 2 and 4) and lower EL% (Table 3 ) than the sensitive 'H71' genotype when heated for 24 h under NFH treatment, which reflects its tolerant nature. The exposure to flooding for at least 6 h under FC treatment provoked greater reductions in Fv/Fm and CC values in 'H71' plants than 'H69' plants (Tables 1 and 2 ). In addition, flooding also significantly decreased the EL in 'H69' plants relative to 'H71' plants after 48-96 h ( Table 3 ), indicating that 'H69' is flood-tolerant. Similar losses of Fv/Fm, CC, and WP and an increase in EL were observed in 'H71' under flooding and high temperature stresses (FH), but responded at different levels over time (Tables 1-4) .

The leaf WP of 'H71' plants under high-temperature treatment was significantly lower than in 'H41' and 'H69' plants after 12 h, indicating that 'H71' plants suffered from heat exposure. A lower osmotic potential is responsible for maintaining turgor when water loss occurs due to high temperature. Thus, high electrical conductivity due to a high concentration of electrolytes in the leaf sap of 'H71' plants should lead to alterations in membrane permeability and a reduced ability to retain solutes and water during high temperature and waterlogging. However, the ability of 'H41' and 'H69' plants to tolerate heat and flood stress, respectively, strongly depends on adjustments in water balance and ionic leakage. A decline in WP and an increase in EL during heat and flood stress were associated with leaf water deficits as well as increases in ionic leakage. At the physiological level, the many effects of flooding and heat stresses indicate the importance of protecting plants from oxidative damage caused by the overproduction of ROS that is elicited by increased ion leakage (Kangasjarvi et al., 2008) . The chlorophyll fluorescence emission parameter, Fv/Fm, which is widely used as a proxy for the maximum quantum efficiency of PS II photochemistry, was correlated with flooding and high temperature tolerance. In healthy leaves, the Fv/Fm value is close to 0.8, which is a typical value for uninhibited plants.

Flooding and high temperatures inhibit photosynthetic CO 2 fixation and damages photosynthetic electron transport at the site of PSII where there exists a very sensitive photosynthesis apparatus. This reduction in the CO 2 assimilation rate observed in 'H71' plants was generated by effects on the Calvin cycle and also on PSII functioning. Exposure of 'H71' plants to flooding and high temperature may lead to reductions in net photosynthetic rate, stomatal closure, and cell activities that damage photosynthetic membranes (Jiang and Huang, 2001) . These results suggested that the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were stress specific and were not expressed solely in response to an increasing excess of photon energy. Chloroplast development in 'H71' plants may be particularly sensitive to high temperature and flooding. Alternatively, the pigments of the sensitive cultivar might have been destroyed because of a high sensitivity to oxidative stress. 'H71' plants suffered greater CC losses than 'H41' and 'H69' plants after 24-96 h of exposure. Flooding and heat may induce stomatal closure and consequently reduce CC levels and WP as well. Typically, the amount of CC is reduced by stress. This is consistent with our observations that chlorophyll loss was more pronounced in waterlog-and heat-sensitive 'H71' plants in accordance with the more pronounced and increased visible symptoms of leaf injury. Leaf curling or folding were the initial and most obvious changes observed. Most 'H71' leaves progressively became necrotic, epinastic, or wilted over the course of time; however, most 'H41' and 'H69' leaves visually appeared to be green and healthy after 72 h of flooding and high temperature (photos not shown). Along with visual symptoms, reduced CC could be used to monitor flooding and heat damage in green or senescent leaves. Attempts have been made to breed for increased flooding tolerance and modify Brassica cultivation or management practices to avoid injury from flooding and heat. Environmental stresses represent the most limiting conditions for horticultural productivity and plant exploitation worldwide. Important factors among them are water and temperature. Flooding and high temperature are major abiotic stresses resulting in serious problems for the growth and yield of flood-and heat-sensitive plants. It is necessary to identify the physiological characteristics that reflect their complex underlying genetic make-up. These easily measured physiological biomarkers could be used as generic tools to develop a reliable method for selecting cauliflower cultivars having flood-and heat-stress resistance. Tables 1-4 demonstrate that the chlorophyll losses in 'H71' plants were in concert with increasing EL accumulations after 6 h of flooding and heat treatments, which is an index of oxidative damages to cell constituents in general. This suggests that Fv/Fm and CC can be effectively used as reporter signals in screening for flooding and high temperature tolerances. These easily measured physiological biomarkers could be used as generic tools for developing a reliable method to select 'H41' and 'H69' cultivars having flooding and heat-stress resistances. These findings are important for farming in high-temperature areas and wetlands or other areas subject to short and intense rainfall events.",

Changes in protein accumulation under stress are directly related to the physiological phenotypic responses of plants to stress. The proteomic responses to high-temperature or flood stresses are known for several plants, including rice (Lin et al., 2005) , wheat (Majoul et al., 2004) , barley (S\u00fcle et al., 2004) , soybean (Komatsu et al., 2013) , radish (Zhang et al., 2013) , Arabidopsis thaliana (Palmblad et al., 2008) , Agave americana (Shakeel et al., 2013) , and Populus euphratica (Ferreira et al., 2006) . In the present study, we analyzed physiological and proteomics data in different genotypes of cauliflower under conditions of high-temperature and waterlogging stresses over different time periods. Approximately 250 peaks were detected at the tested time points, whereas 85 peaks were successfully observed to be differentially regulated (14 down-regulated, 71 up-regulated) and expressed at a minimum of one time point. Among them, 33, 29, and 9 proteins were identified in 'H41', 'H69', and 'H71' plants, respectively, indicating that they were regulated in a genotype-specific manner ( Supplementary Fig. S5 ). Rubisco small and large chains, 16 kDa calcium-binding protein, molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein A, and phosphoserine aminotransferase were observed in both 'H41' and 'H69' plants. Phosphoribosylformyl glycinamidine synthase and arginyl-tRNA synthetase were both found in 'H71' and 'H69' plants ( Supplementary Fig. S5 ). Moreover, in 'H41' plants, peaks 253 and 254 were both identified as DNA mismatch repair protein mutS, while 291 and 263 were identified as phosphoglucosamine mutase (Tables 5 and 7 ). These sister peaks may represent close homologues, but this could not be resolved based on mass spectrometric data and might instead be isoforms resulting from differential post-translational modifications (Rollins et al., 2013) .",

Photosynthesis is one of the systems that is most sensitive to high-temperature stress. Changes in environmental temperatures are primarily reflected in photosynthesis, triggering a response that is aimed toward the best possible performance under new conditions. For this, a balance is sought between the energy of absorbed light, carbon assimilation, and consumption by metabolic sinks. Several studies have shown that high-temperature stress can significantly inhibit the rate of photosynthesis (Yan et al., 2013; Salvucci and Crafts-Brandner, 2004) . In our study, Rubisco units (small and large chain) related to photosynthesis were differentially expressed and regulated by combination treatments and among genotypes. For example, the up-regulation of Rubisco was detected in 'H41' (peaks 236 and 255, Table 7 ) and 'H69' (peaks 2312 (peaks , 2314 (peaks , 2818 (peaks , 222,223, 2310 (peaks , 2311 . However, the level of expression of the Rubisco large subunit was down-regulated in 'H69' during FH treatment for 24 h (peaks 2511, 264, and 266, Table 8 ). Rubisco proteins resist high-temperature and flood stresses by inhibiting photosynthesis and other nonessential metabolic processes. In contrast, to increase energy metabolism, the expression of proteins related to redox homeostasis and response to stimuli were up-regulated, thereby maintaining physiological balance during stress. Rubisco catalyzes the first major step of carbon fixation in photosynthesis. Affinity of Rubisco for CO 2 decreases with increasing temperature (Yan et al., 2013) . The diminished capacity of Rubisco and its low affinity for CO 2 suggest that carbon fixation or assimilation was highly inhibited when 'H69' plants were exposed to stress, especially under the high temperature and flooding stresses ( Table 8 ) that lead to reduced rates of photosynthetic CO 2 assimilation. Photorespiration serves as an energy sink, preventing the over-reduction of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and photoinhibition. Lee et al. (2007) reported that high temperature over 2 h significantly inhibits the activity and quantity of Rubisco subunits in rice seedlings. The effects of drought stress on Rubisco represent reductions in Rubisco activity (Parry et al., 2002) . Exposure to salt stress brings about a reduction in the overall growth and productivity of plants by disturbing the function of vital components of photosynthesis, such as PSII and Rubisco (Ghaffaria et al., 2014) . Consequently, a strong reduction in Fv/Fm value (Table 1 ) and CC content ( Table 2 ) while maintaining photosynthesis under stress after 24 h was seen in all plants. Some researchers report its up-regulation (Ge et al., 2012; Budak et al., 2013) , whereas others find downregulation (Gaoa et al., 2011) or even both (Guoa et al., 2012) in response to abiotic stresses. As a result, an up-regulation in Rubisco levels may also indicate an increase in the photorespiration rate.",

            "text": "Molecular chaperones, including heat shock proteins (HSPs), are key components of innate immunity in plants. They have major roles in protein folding and signal-transduction networks, cellcycle control, protein degradation, and protein trafficking (Wang et al., 2004) . HSP chaperone pathways require energy in the form of ATP hydrolysis in order to function. The ATP-dependent Clp proteases (HSP100) represent a class of HSP. In addition to their function as molecular chaperones, they function in protein disaggregation and protein degradation when removal of potentially harmful polypeptides arising from misfolding, denaturation, or aggregation are important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The mechanism for rescuing proteins from aggregation is proposed to include the cooperation HSP100 (Kregel, 2002; Sarkar et al., 2011) . HSPs are typically induced when cells are exposed to various types of environmental stresses. The synthesis of HSPs under high temperatures is reported to be related to thermotolerance in plants, and plants with a decreased expression of HSPs show compromised tolerance to acquired thermo-tolerance (Charng et al., 2006) . HSPs are closely related to the acquisition of heat resistance in plants. Choi et al. (2012) identify several high molecular weight HSPs whose expression was up-regulated significantly in Pyropia tenera under high-temperature stress for 1 h and 3 h. Furthermore, Lee et al. (2007) report that several HSPs are expressed in rice leaves during heat stress. High temperature might increase the potential risk of protein misfolding, and an active protein quality control system inside cells plays an important role in plant tolerance to heat stress. HSPs are also increased by drought stress in the sugar beet (Hajheidari et al., 2005) , wheat (Demirevska et al., 2008) , and sugarcane (Jangpromma et al., 2010) . In our study, peak 261 of ATP-dependent Clp protease proteolytic subunit 1 was up-regulated in response to heat stress for 24 h in 'H41' plants (Table 7) . This suggests that the increased level of HSP100 under high-temperature stress allowed the heat-tolerant 'H41' to produce more energy through ATP hydrolysis and the degradation or reactivation of damaged proteins and prevented protein misfolding, resulting in reestablishing normal protein conformations and cellular homeostasis.",

The elongation of polypeptide chains during translation is a conserved process among prokaryotes and eukaryotes. EFs are the critical regulators of protein synthesis, which is influenced by high temperature and drought stress in Arabidopsis (Rizhsky et al., 2004) and rapeseed (Mohammadi et al., 2012) . Regulation of the transcriptional and translational machinery is considered to be an important component of cellular stress response. The increased expression of EF greA in 'H69' and EF G in 'H71' likely led to increased protein synthesis, which served to reduce the effects of treatment stress.",

Our data suggest that the early response of cauliflower to flooding and high temperature might be an important stress adaptation for survival following not only hypoxia and heat, but also direct damage to cells by flooding and high temperature. All of the identified proteins likely work cooperatively to reestablish cellular homeostasis under stress. The long term goal of our work is to help breed a competitively higher flood-and heat-tolerant cauliflower to be grown in lowlands during summer. The identification of the unique stress-responsive proteins will allow further dissection of the genetic basis of this transgressive performance in offspring. Our results not only provide information for selecting lines having better tolerance to waterlogging and heat stresses, but also provide a basis for understanding cauliflower metabolic pathways and their cross-talk under stress. Further verification of the correlative stress-responsive protein by gene expression analyses of these stressed-responsive genes, such as Rubisco, EFs, HSP100, FBPase, ADK, ATP synthase, SAM synthetase, PPR protein, GTP-binding protein lepA, Ca +2 -binding protein, and ribosomal protein L11P, would facilitate our understanding of the heat-and flood-response mechanism in cauliflowers.",

Different genotypes showed differing physiological responses to combinations of stress treatments. All dynamics of the peaks were analyzed across all treatments, and a comparative analysis identified 85 stressresponsive proteins in cauliflower under short-term stressing. The majority of these stressed-responsive proteins were genotype specific. These identified proteins emerged as key participants in stress tolerance. Most of the changes in the expression levels of these proteins in response to stressing were involved in photosynthesis. 'H69' plants resisted high-temperature stressing by inhibiting photosynthesis and other unnecessary metabolic processes. Energy metabolism was increased and up-regulation of the expression of proteins related to cellular homeostasis, as well as those that respond to stimuli, served to maintain physiological balance during stress. Concurrently, the expression levels of proteins related to transcription, translation, and signal transduction were also up-regulated to promote survival under HF stressing. The genetic variations identified in the proteomes, plant growth, and photosynthetic performance in response to flood and heat represent stress adaption mechanisms to be exploited in future cauliflower breeding efforts.",

However, significant decreases in the Fv/Fm ratio of 'H41' plants were observed as late as 48 h under heat treatment (NFH). In addition, when treatments were compared across stressing times of 6-96 h, both control (NFC) and NFH treatments exhibited significantly higher Fv/Fm values than FC and FH treatments, indicating that 'H41' is a heat-tolerant cultivar, and this increase in Fv/Fm value was clearly evident with the 40 \u2022 C treatment (NFH). Slight decreases in Fv/Fm values were noted in 'H69' plants with FC treatment as flood stress time was extended, but high temperature treatments (NFH and FH) rapidly decreased Fv/Fm values in 'H69' over time. 'H69' Fv/Fm values over time under NFC and FC treatments were both significantly higher compared to NFH and FH treatments, suggesting that 'H69' is a flood-tolerant cultivar, and this increase in Fv/Fm value was obvious in the flooding-alone treatment (FC). Fv/Fm values in 'H71' plants under stressed treatments (FC, NFC, and FH) appeared to be significantly lower than under NFC after 6 h of treatment, indicating that 'H71' is not a flood-or heat-tolerant cultivar.Chlorophyll content (CC) was assessed over time under various treatments, and its patterns and trends were similar to those of Fv/Fm. When NFC treatment over time was compared, all 'H69' and 'H71' plants exhibited significantly higher CC levels (61.0-56.1) than 'H41' plants (49.3-47.5) at all times(Table 2); thus, the CC of different genotypes responded totally differently to non-flooding and heat stresses. CC also gradually decreased in all plants during all time intervals under stressing treatments. The trend in CC under NFC treatment was similar to that of NFH treatment in 'H41' and FC treatment in 'H69' at all time intervals. A maximal decrease from 56.4 (0 h) to 16.5 (96 h) was found with FH treatment over time for 'H71' plants.As shown inTable 3, the levels of EL (%) in all plants increased at different rates as stress duration was extended. 'H41' plants under NFH treatment exhibited lower levels of EL compared to 'H69' and 'H71' from 48 to 96 h. However, EL in 'H41' showed significantly higher values after 6 h with FC treatments compared to 'H69' plants, and the highest value (89.9%) was found with FC treatment at 96 h. Furthermore, EL showed no significant difference for all plants over time under the NFC condition. Overall, the study showed different EL values in the different cultivars under different treatment durations.",
