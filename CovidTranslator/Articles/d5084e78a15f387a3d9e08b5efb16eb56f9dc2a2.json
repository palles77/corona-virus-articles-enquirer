Rotavirus VP8 subunit is the major determinant of the viral infectivity and neutralization. Spike glycoprotein of coronavirus is responsible for induction of neutralizing antibody response. Methods: In the present study, several prediction programs were used to predict B and Tcells epitopes, secondary and tertiary structures, antigenicity ability and enzymatic degradation sites. Finally, a chimeric antigen was designed using computational techniques. The chimeric VP8-S2 antigen was constructed. It was cloned and sub-cloned into pGH and pET32a(+) expression vector. The recombinant pET32a(+)-VP8-S2 vector was transferred into E.oli BL21CodonPlus (DE3) as expression host. The recombinant VP8-S2 protein was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography column.",

            "text": "Rotavirus group A is one of the main causes of diarrhea and gastrointestinal disease in humans, calves, sheep, swine. 1 Bovine rotavirus group A (BRV) commonly occurs in calves 1-8 weeks of age. 2 It is the main cause of mortality in calves and leads to increase treatment cost and reduces growth rate in calve. 3 The BRV infects the mature enterocytes of the small intestine and causes pathological changes in the small intestine. 4 The BRV group A belongs to genus Rotavirus in the family of Reoviridae and is composed of 11 segments of double stranded RNA surrounded by three concentric layers of protein. 5 There are six viral proteins that are called VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, VP6 and VP7. In addition, there are six nonstructural proteins (NSPs) that are only produced in cells infected by rotavirus, which are called NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, NSP5 and NSP6. 6 Based on serological cross-reactivities rotaviruses are classified into P serotype and G serotype and up to now 31 P and 23 G serotypes are identified that P [1] , P [5] , and P [11] of P and G6,G8 and G10 of G serotypes are the most frequent ones in calves. 7 Proteins VP4 and VP7 from the outer layer are two independent antigens inducing neutralizing antibodies to the virus. 5 It is believed that both VP4 and VP7 proteins are important for the development of rotavirus vaccine. 2 The VP4 protein is a P type determinant whereas the VP7 protein is a G type determinant. The VP4 protein is a cytoplasmic protein, it is not glycosylated, and thus the protein produced in prokaryotes may mimic the native structure of the VP4 protein. 8 The VP4 has no signal peptide at the amino terminus of the protein. The VP4 protein involved in some functions including: hemagglutination, cell penetration, neutralization and the determinant of virulence. 9 The VP4 protein has a molecular mass of 88 kDa and it is presented as a series of spikes with 10-12 nm in length. 10 The VP4 protein is cleaved by proteolytic enzyme, trypsin cleavage of V4 produces fragments VP8 (N-terminal region) and VP5 (C-terminal region),which have molecular mass of 28 kDa and 60 kDa, respectively. The VP8 protein has a hemagglutination domain. 11 The cleavage site is located at position 241 and 247. 12 Studies showed that VP8 and VP5 fragments can inhibit virus attachment to cells and the virus is neutralized by them. 13, 14 Some of studies have shown that some amino acids are conserved in the most rotavirus strains. 15 Bovine coronavirus (BCV) is the major cause of diarrhea in neonatal calves and winter dysentery in cattle worldwide. 16 It belongs to Coronaviridea family. 17 The BCV contains a large single and positive-stranded RNA genome. It has structural proteins which are called nucleocapsid (N), tran-membrane (M), spike (S), small membrane (E), and hemagglutinin/esterase (HE). 18 The S protein of BCV is a glycoprotein of 1363 amino acids and it is on the surface of the coronavirus virion that contains two regions, one of which is located at Nterminal (S1subunit) and the other located at Cterminal(S2 subunit). The S protein is cleaved in position 768 and 769 to two subunits by trypsin cleavage. 19 It is involved in some functions such as induction of neutralizing antibody response, 20 and binding to susceptible cell. 21 Computational tools can be used for the prediction of B and T-cell epitopes for their use in antibody production, immunodiagnostics and epitope-based vaccine design. 22 Bioinformatic approaches are relatively rapid and inexpensive. They can be used, at least in part to replace by experimental methods. 23 Several epitopes prediction software programs are available. The first generation of these prediction tools performed base on motif-based algorithms, 24 antigen primary amino acid sequence, 25 3D structure and other protein characteristics such as accessibility, hydrophilicity and flexibility. 26 Because, the VP8 and S2 antigens induce protective immune responses against bovine rotavirus and coronavirus. On the other side the chimeric recombinant antigens are economical to introduce and produce an effective multivalent vaccine; the objective of the present study was the use of combined rotavirus-coronavirus antigens to design a multi-epitope antigen to investigate cloning and expression in prokaryote cell. Then, this antigen introduce to produce immunoglobulin, recombinant vaccine and diagnostic kit in future studies after it passes biological activity tests in vivo in animal model and or other suitable procedure. In the present study, we used the bioinformatics tools to predict antigenic regions of the VP8 and S2 proteins in order to construct VP8-S2 chimeric antigen. The chimeric VP8-S2 antigen was cloned and sub-cloned into pGH and pET32a(+). Co-expression of the chimeric VP8-S2 antigen was investigated in prokaryote cell.",

For epitope prediction of the S2 protein, we chose conserved regions of S2 protein. B and T-cell epitopes of the proteins encoded by these genes were predicted using different servers and software like as: ABCpred, BepiPred, BCPred, SVMTrip and LEPS for B-cell prediction and IEDB, SYFPEITH, PropredI and Propred for T-cell prediction. Several supplementary criteria such as antigenicity, hydrophobicity, accessibility and flexibility were used in epitope characterization. The fragments that involve high density of immune-dominant epitopes were selected for each of the antigens. Secondary structure was predicted using the improved self-optimized prediction method (SOPMA) software (http://npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/cgibin/npsa_automat.pl?page=/NPSA/ npsa_sopma.html). 27 Four conformational states (helices, sheets, turns and coils) of candidate genes were analyzed. Tertiary structure was predicted by various servers such as I-TASSER",

The results of recombinant colonies were verified using colony PCR by pET T7 primers (Figure 4a ). The existence of VP8-S2 fragment in pET32a(+) were confirmed by enzymatic digestion (Figure 4b ). The results of sequencing showed no changes in amino acid sequence of the VP8-S2 protein. Expression of the recombinant VP8-S2 protein was checked by 12% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis by 1mM concentration of IPTG in two hours after induction ( Figure 5) . A protein 33 kDa (pET32(18.5kDa)+ VP8-S2(14.45 kDa)) could be detected in Coomassie blue staining. The results of expression analysis indicated that recombinant VP8-S2 protein could be expressed highly in E.coli cells. This vector is able to express a fusion protein with a 6-histidine tag at thrombin site and a T7 tag at the N-terminus. These additional amino acids increase to the size of the expressed protein near 18.5KDa. This recombinant protein was verified by dot-blot analysis. The result of dot-blot analysis using anti-His tag confirmed the existence of recombinant VP8-S2 protein (Figure 6a ).

The BRV and BCV are the most common viruses of diarrhea in neonatal calves, piglet and sheep. It leads to economic loss following treatment costs, decrease of growth rate and mortality would be detrimental. 29 Studies showed that the most important pathogens in calf diarrhea are rotavirus, Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, coronavirus, salmonella and cryptosporidium. 30 Maternal antibodies (colostrum) protect the neonatal offspring against rotavirus and coronavirus diarrhea for the first several days of life. Moreover, milk antibodies drop rapidly in cattle that often develop neonatal diarrhea after calves become infected with rotavirus and coronavirus. 31 The development of vaccines or administration of milk supplements will be cased passive protection for the first several days of life against BRV and BCV. 32 The development of epitope vaccines based on experimental research is very costly research which uses molecular biology and immunology technologies. The accuracy of this computational approach has been greatly enhanced using statistical methods. 33 Many of researchers have used the VP8 and S2 antigens as a candidate vaccine in different expression schemes like baculovirus, 34 E.coli, 35, 36 and concluded that these antigens can be considered an immunogen in vaccine studies against the BRV and BCV. 37, 7 The main strategy in this study was to design a chimeric antigen (named VP8-S2) carrying various epitopes of the BRV and BCV for co-expression them into E.coli.",

We selected well-known online epitope prediction servers and a multi-method analysis approach to enhance the accuracy of epitopes prediction of the VP8-S2 antigen. The bioinformatics analysis of the VP8 and S2 antigens successfully predicted experimentally demonstrated epitopes. We used VaxiJen server for determining antigenicity of the chimeric VP8-S2 antigen because VaxiJen is the first server for alignmentindependent prediction of protective antigens. It was developed to allow antigen classification based solely on the physicochemical properties of the protein irrespective of sequence length and the need for alignment. It identifies bacterial, viral and tumour antigens using different models. 38 Linkers play an important role in displaying the epitopes on surface of fusion proteins. 39 We used Glycine and Serine (GS 4 ) 3 residues from flexible linkers that could separate different domains in chimeric proteins and they have sufficient flexibility that may enhance protein expression level. 40 Then chimeric VP8-S2 gene was constructed, it was cloned and sub-cloned into pGH and pET32a(+), respectively. The chimeric VP8-S2 gene was expressed in E.coli strain BL21 CondonPlus (DE3) and the recombinant VP8-S2 protein was produced appropriately. It purified using Ni-NTA agarose column for studying its immunogenic potentials in the future. Mayameei et al 41 (2010) revealed that the prevalence of rotavirus and coronavirus infection in diarrheic calves of dairy farms around Mashhad (Iran), were 26.98% and 3.17% respectively. Another study, major types of BRV in Tehran, Alborz and Qazvin of Iran were detected and bovine rotavirus was detected in 39.2% of total samples using ELISA kit. The results of this researchers showed that G10 of type G and P [11] of P type were the most prevalent. Also, the incidence of genotype combination G10P [11] , G6P [5] and G6P [11] were 51.4%, 14.3% and 8.6%, respectively. 42 In other studies, the tobacco mosaic virus vector containing the VP8 bovine rotavirus gene was used for expression of the recombinant VP8 protein and after intraperitoneal inoculation, antibody responses were detected against bovine rotavirus in mice, the mice protected against bovine rotavirus infection. 43 Yoo et al 36 (1997) expressed the VP8* protein of bovine rotavirus strain C486 in E. coli and examined potential of the recombinant VP8* protein for induction of neutralizing antibody responses in host animals. Their results suggest that the E. coli-produced recombinant VP8* protein can be an useful subunit vaccine candidate to prevent rotavirus infection in newborn calves. Favacho et 44 (2006) synthesized VP8 cDNA of strain C486, amplified it by RT-PCR, it was successfully cloned and sub-cloned into pGEM-Easy plasmid and pET28(+) respectively, and it was expressed into E.coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Also, they showed that the VP8ext providing a good source of antigen for the production of P type-specific immune reagents. In one study, Spike glycoprotein (S1 and S2 subunits) was expressed in Sodopterafugiperda insect cells. The result ofinfection of insect cells by the recombinant baculoviruses showed that the S1 and S2 subunits were expressed appropriately. 33 ",
