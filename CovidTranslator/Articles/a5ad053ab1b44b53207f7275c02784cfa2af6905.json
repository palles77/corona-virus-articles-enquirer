The resulting datasets and subsequent modeling analysis predict key regulatory checkpoints, define protective/pathogenic outcomes, and require additional rounds of validation, data Despite the conflict, systems biology and reductionist-based approaches are not antithetical (10) . While the individual merits can be argued, the combination of these approaches has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of biology. Reductionist-based science can benefit from the expansion of understanding generated by the systems-based approach to link pathways and targets to disease outcomes. Similarly, systems biology can utilize mechanistic insights and rigorous validation studies derived from reductionist approaches to refine and expand their models. In this way, these competing methods can form a symbiotic relationship and drive forward our understanding of complex biological systems. In this review, we offer a path to reconcile the systems biology paradigm with reductionist science employing global tenets, demonstrating specific examples, and outlining future directions. Our hope is that this blueprint can provide a bridge between the two approaches and result in expanded understanding of immunology and infectious disease going forward.",

            "text": "While new technologies, high throughput datasets, and substantial resources play important roles, the key factor in the success of a systems biology group is the ability to communicate and interact across disciplines. The systems biology paradigm requires the integration of numerous components to successfully interrogate and evaluate the connectivity that exists between biological and genomic information (Fig. 1 ). Merging massive biological and clinical correlates with mathematical and computational modeling followed by validation and extension represents one of the most challenging aspects of the systems biology approach. Building a multidisciplinary team of independent researchers provides a means to rapidly integrate these different disciplines; however, the process is intrinsically difficult and requires dedicated effort and continuous interaction. For example, mathematical modeling often can exclude 99% of possible targets, leaving 1% for examination; yet for transcriptional data sets, this can result in >1000 possible gene targets which prove unmanageable for testing and validation. Similarly, the absence of mock treatments or sufficient sample numbers greatly reduces the power and utility of any modeling algorithm. In each case, consistent communication is required to harmonize key issues in study that maintain experimental and statistical rigor as well as model performance. In our experience, constant dialogue through multimedia channels, and more importantly, via face to face meetings provides an essential dynamic for developing coordinated experimental and modeling platforms that maintain statistical rigor, inform across disciplines, and promote key relationships for program performance. Without this underlying foundation, the systems biology paradigm would ultimately fail to produce any useful insights into biological functions.",

Using contrast as an initial parameter, modeling approaches can then focus on these specific conditions and time points, removing the majority superfluous data and extinguishing much of the noise within the system.

The purpose of this is to generate data and targets that are not biased by the previous knowledge base. While this premise is critically important for experimental design and data acquisition, target generation is inherently a biased approach. In the systems biology landscape, the bias is typically towards mathematical models built upon expansive biological databases; this methodology allows generation of novel targets independent of the previous knowledge bases. Yet, this approach discounts the prior experimental understanding and fails to utilize it in refining targets. Therefore, after the generation of unbiased gene sets that discriminate between different biological stimuli (e.g. different viruses, mutants, age, dose, etc.), we sought to incorporate known correlates into our modeling in order to refine and produce better targets for confirmation and validation studies. An example of this approach is integration of a known viral protein function or analysis of a process shown to be important to the infection. In addition, observation from broad systems-based studies can also be utilized to refine the predictive model. In this way, we are able to improve the quality of target selection for downstream validation studies.",

Often, the numerous targets make it nearly impossible to adequately demonstrate validation of the broad pathways identified. However, the first two tenets of our systems biology approach begin to address this scope issue. To fully address this criticism, our group began by making a distinction between confirmation and validation. Confirmation, for our purposes, is verification of the same biological output by a different method or in a different experimental condition. For example, array data generated from a cell line can be confirmed by either real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of targeted genes or by repeating the experiment in an independent culture system. In contrast, validation occurs when initial findings are verified with a different biological output. For example, RNA expression data can be validated by proteomics and/or immunohistochemical staining. Together, confirmation and validation are paramount in our systems biology approach and are necessary to provide robust verification of systems-based targets. Therefore, we have added increased emphasis to this area to allow pursuit of further studies through both iterative studies and the approach outlined in our final tenet.",

Yet, this process requires significant capital in terms of both time and resources. Importantly, continuation of the iterative cycle may not extend the observed finding, but rather identify new areas to explore. Therefore, our group examined ways to extend system biology findings beyond the iterative cycle by using standard reductionist techniques. Typically, these experiments query mechanistic aspects, seeking to identify required viral components or molecular processes involved in protective or pathogenic response and disease outcomes. Examples include studies of functional assays, identification of structural motifs, and/or utilization of knockout animals. Together, this approach effectively provides a second level of validation and provides similar outputs as reductionist-based studies. In addition, these types of analysis can be programmed into the iterative cycle of systems biology and provide the perturbation necessary for the next round of data generation.",

Instead, these tenets provide a means to meld systems biology and reductionist approaches in order to move away from broad, discovery-based, and descriptive analysis and toward novel insights with validated functional consequence. Using this modified approach also provides an opportunity for extended understanding with either systems or reductionist-based approaches. The examples highlighted below demonstrate the efficacy of this methodology and provide a window into a possible future direction for systems-based analysis.",

Utilizing overexpression systems, functional assays, and a variety of viral mutants, numerous RNA and DNA virus proteins have been characterized by reductionist approaches, leading to important biological findings and translational products like vaccines and therapeutics. These proteins have primarily been associated with either the viral life cycle (viral polymerases, structural proteins, etc.) or viral-host interaction like immune antagonism. Yet, due to their limited genetic capacity, RNA viruses typically encode multifunctional proteins that perform numerous processes beyond the scope of viral replication or immune evasion. Often, identifying these additional processes may be very difficult to reveal using traditional reductionist approaches. In these situations, systems biology provides an opportunity to utilize detailed experimental data to predict and identify novel roles for viral proteins. This fact is illustrated by our examination of SARS-CoV open reading frame 6 (ORF6) protein (20) .",

While non-essential for in vitro replication, initial screens quickly identified ORF6 as an interferon antagonist (22) . Subsequent experiments established that ORF6 interfered with signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling via binding karyopherin \u03b12, trapping both the import factor and its partner in complex karyopherin \u03b21 (24, 25) . The resulting block prevented STAT1 nuclear localization and interfered with induction of the antiviral state within the host. Yet, despite its role in antagonizing the type I interferon (IFN) response, mutant SARS-CoV lacking ORF6 (\u0394ORF6) grows to titers equivalent to WT in both IFN competent (CALU3) and incompetent cells (Vero) (20) . Similarly, type I IFN pretreatment has only a modest impact on viral replication of \u0394ORF6, resulting in reduced titers similar to WT SARS-CoV (data not shown). These results argued that the absence of ORF6 is complemented by the myriad of other SARS-CoV IFN antagonist (26) . However, in vivo infection revealed significant attenuation of \u0394ORF6 pathogenesis; notably, this attenuation did not extend to viral titers within the lung. Together, the data argued that ORF6 plays a role beyond just IFN antagonism.",

Modeling the data with a focus on gene ontology confirmed augmented expression of antiviral genes.

Additional analysis filtered the dataset by the known ability of ORF6 to inhibit karyopherin based transport; the resulting modeling revealed important transcriptional hubs that play a critical role in differential regulation of cellular processes. These hubs, which include CREB1, VDR, and p53, were then confirmed in primary human airway epithelial cultures and validated using both proteomic and chromatin immunoperciptiation approaches.

Together, these studies illustrate a trend that has implications on future systems-based analysis of viral proteins. As mentioned previously, one tenet of our approach focuses on contrasts within the system. Using \u0394ORF6 studies as a template (20) , mutants with ablated viral protein activity can be examined and compared to WT virus to quickly identify differential host gene expression. These host responses can then be modeled to determine broad differences based on gene ontology, pathway disruption, or a variety of other transcription based categorizations. This type of analysis provides a window into the possible functions of a specific viral protein and an avenue to begin further studies. Notably, known functions derived from reductionist approaches can also be integrated into the modeling which provides both refined targeting as well as incorporating the second tenet of our systems based approach. Next, identified targets can be confirmed and validated by a variety of approaches including proteomics analysis, drug treatments, or knockdown studies to demonstrate functional significance in vitro. Finally, further model refinement and validation can be provided by in vivo systems-based analysis. Together, these steps outline a blue print for systems-based characterization of novel viral protein function and have been initiated for several viral proteins in both SARS-CoV (ExoN, NSP16, ORF3) and IAV (NS1, PB1, PB2).",

This fact explains the existence and reliance on mouse models of infection for numerous viral pathogens including SARS-CoV and IAV. Yet, traditional in vivo studies have focused on either known target genes that regulate immunity or have utilized viral mutants for comparative analysis with WT viruses. The result has been extensive examination and understanding of innate and adaptive immune components that regulate viral disease mostly in terms of viral replication.

However, these doses sharply diverge in terms of weight loss at late time points and overall lethality. This contrast provided an opportunity to explore pathways and networks that were different between lethal and sub-lethal disease. To incorporate this biological data, we utilized a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA); this approach uses underlying correlation structures to partition gene expression into modules not biased by existing knowledge bases (36) . Connectivity inferred by WGCNA is a strong predictor of biological function and the most highly connected hub genes provide candidate mediators of disease that have been used in a variety of fields including cancer, plant, and genetics (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) . Gene ontology analysis of this module revealed a strong categorization for extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and wound healing pathways. While previously shown to be important in lung diseases (43, 44) , these pathways had been largely unstudied within the context of viral respiratory disease. To further narrow candidate pathways for confirmation and validation purposes, we evaluated the connectivity and module membership within the known biological pathways.

Therefore, we utilized paired in vivo proteomics data to analyze differences in urokinase pathway related components following the lethal and sub-lethal doses. Our results showed a significant increase in several urokinase pathway related proteins during the lethal dose as compared to the sub-lethal dose (Gralinski et al, manuscript submitted). These proteins, which include fibrin chains, fibronectin, and plasminogen, confirmed enhanced urokinase activity following the lethal challenge. Similarly, histology staining for fibrin deposition confirmed augmented staining during lethal SARS-CoV infection. Finally, we chose to employ a standard reductionist approach, gene knockout, to further validate the role of urokinase pathway in vivo. Mice lacking Serpine1, an important negative regulator within the urokinase pathway, were challenged with SARS-CoV and had increased weight loss, lung hemorrhage, and increased lethality as compared to control mice. Together, these data confirm a role for the urokinase pathway in regulating lethal SARS-CoV disease and validated a target generated by our systems-based modeling.",

Systems virology data sets alleviated these problems and permits analysis beyond a single treatment or infection condition. Therefore, in lieu of the typical unbiased modeling approach, we incorporated a network with known biological importance to virus infection: type I interferon (IFN) and ISGs. Type I IFN induces a signaling cascade that arms immune defenses and serve to provide the first line of defense against viral pathogens (50, 51) . Upon binding through the type I IFN receptor, IFN signaling initiates transcription of hundreds of ISGs that have anti-viral, immune modulatory, and cell regulatory functions. Expression of these genes within host cells renders an inhospitable anti-viral state critical to limiting viral infection in vitro and in vivo. While several prominent ISGs like Mx, PKR, and OAS have been studied in depth, the vast majority have never been fully evaluated. Yet, the ISGs impact on viral infection is clear; in the absence of the type I IFN cascade, the host fails to mount effective immune responses and becomes very susceptible to viral challenge (52) . Successful viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV and IAV, have developed means to overcome specific IFN and ISG effector functions (26, 53, 54) . Globally, ISGs as a class have broad functions beyond just direct viral antagonism including increased MHC class I and II expression, augmented immune infiltration and trafficking, and host protein shutoff (50) . These processes can impede viral replication and pathogenesis; therefore, viruses likely attempt to short-circuit global ISG induction, potentially through different means.",

To answer these questions, we utilized reductionist-based approaches but applied systems generated data where possible. Using RNA expression data, we asked and confirmed that ISG delay following SARS-CoV was primarily due to delayed type I IFN production. Modeling downstream gene expression patterns, we also determined that H5N1-VN1203 did not target transcriptional factors to mediate ISG antagonism. Next, we utilized RNA expression patterns to identify target genes for differential histone modification. The resulting experiment confirmed that H5N1-VN1203 mediated incorporation of a repressive histone modification in the 5' untranslated region of down regulated ISGs; this modification was absent in up regulated ISGs. Having established a role for epigenetic regulation in the ISG antagonism, we next sought to identify the involved viral components. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, a statistical technique to visualize similarities and differences between data sets, revealed informative insights for both SARS-CoV and IAV infection (Fig. 4) . MDS analysis comparing ISG expression following WT and \u0394ORF6 SARS-CoV infection demonstrated little contrast between the two, suggesting a limited role for ORF6 in global ISG antagonism. In contrast, MDS analysis of H5N1 mutants revealed NS1 truncation resulted in closer alignment with H1N1-CA04 ISG expression than WT; PB1 and PB2 mutants had some change, but aligned closer to the WT. Subsequent experiments revealed that NS1 truncation ablated ISG down regulation and no incorporation of the repressive histone marker. These findings suggest that epigenetic regulation via NS1, in addition to interference with sensing/signaling, contributes to IAV control of the type I IFN response. Together, these results established novel mechanistic insights into ISG antagonism by both SARS-CoV and IAV.",

The analysis builds upon the infrastructure of systems biology using previously evaluated pathogens to provide a useful comparison. With this data in hand, HCoV-EMC was rapidly evaluated against the related SARS-CoV in a common culture system. The result was a plethora of new data that greatly aided our understanding of the virus/host interactions. In addition, the systems biology data provided the opportunity to compare the novel CoV with other respiratory viruses like H5N1-VN1203. These comparisons allow identification of similarities and differences in terms of host response that might inform treatment and therapeutic options. Similarly, the analysis of multiple pathogens permits the development of expression signatures associated with virulence. For example, ISG manipulation by both H5N1-VN1203 and HCoV-EMC could be used as a signature to rapidly evaluate the pathogenic potential of emergent or zoonotic viral strains. Similar approaches with other host expression pathways and the addition of other virulent and avirulent pathogens across several viral families might provide a mosaic of signatures to quickly and rapidly assess the danger posed by a particular emergent pathogen. Together, the data illustrate that the infrastructure of systems biology provides a unique and novel platform to evaluate emergent viruses and demonstrates the rapid analysis not typically associated with systems-based analysis (61).",

The approach resulted in diverse, high throughput datasets that served as the basis for the development and application of our mathematical models.

Similarly, we plan to expand our experiments beyond the Calu3 cell line and HAE cultures used in our initial studies; primary type II pnuemocytes, alveolar macrophage cultures, endothelial cells, and infiltrating immune cell populations are important targets for viral infection and their response to infection is likely governed by cell-type and tissue specific factors. Exploring this tissue specificity of respiratory pathogens provides insights into disease progression, keys to severity, and possible cell specific targets for therapeutic development. In regards to in vivo experiments, we plan to use mouse resources like the collaborative cross (discussed below) and age dependent models to provide additional scope and contrast for systems-based analysis. In addition to altered and expanded experimental conditions, we also plan to increase the measured outputs available for analysis.

Yet, exploring genetic diversity had been limited by the lack of experimental systems that model human outbred populations. The collaborative cross (CC), a novel panel of approximately 300 genetically related recombinant inbred lines, solves these problems as it was designed to model genetic diversity in outbred populations like humans (62) (63) (64) (65) (66) (67) . Derived from eight founder lines, the CC provides extensive variation (47 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and 4 million insertions/deletions, on the same order as those observed in the human genome), high reproducibility of genetically identical mouse lines, and customization via inbred intercrosses. Screening infectious disease outcomes in this resource provides the opportunity to understand how genetic variation within a population affects the host response to viral infection. Importantly, the CC is powerful enough to untangle the role of monogenic and oligogenetic traits in complex disease phenotypes by providing a diverse range of independent readouts ideal for modeling areas like inflammation, innate immunity, and lymphocyte responses (68) . For example, SARS-CoV infection in the founder lines results in dramatically divergent disease outcomes ranging from mild respiratory and clinical disease symptoms (<5% weight loss) to fulminant lethal disease in 2 or 3 days and a wide range in lethal doses ranging from <10 2 to >10 6 , depending on the line (data not shown). Another initial study infected the precursor to the CC (the pre-CC) with IAV and was limited to a single animal each from 155 lines (69) . However, the data from these genetically unique animals at a single time point was sufficient to define quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with host responses including virus-induced weight loss, titer, pulmonary edema, neutrophil recruitment, and transcriptional expression. Similar results with SARS-CoV (data not shown) demonstrated the success of this approach even on such a small-scale experiment. Subsequently, our group is seeking to identify natural polymorphisms and oligogenetic traits that regulate the immune response following SARS-CoV, IAV, and West Nile Virus (WNV) infection in the full CC over the next five years. Measuring a wide array of immune parameters at multiple time points in >150 distinct lines, this project will effectively produce the largest and most comprehensive database for in vivo immune responses, host expression patterns, and disease outcomes in a reproducible animal model of outbred human populations following viral infection. Applying systems-based techniques to these data sets provides the opportunity to understand the virus-host interaction networks that regulate disease severity and protective immunity, leading to new therapeutic intervention strategies. Together, the approach has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the immune system and make significant contributions to the understanding and treatment of human disease.",

While other measurements, including histology and flow cytometry analysis, can provide a window into respiratory function in vivo, previous studies suggest that they do not necessarily correlate well with pathogenesis and survival (69) . Therefore, we sought to add an additional dimension to systems-based analysis with measurement of lung function following viral infection. Using the Buxco whole body unrestrained plethysmography system, respiratory function can be tracked in the same animal over a time courses and has already been utilized in studies for RSV, WNV, and IAV (70-72). In our system, SARS-CoV, IAV, or mock infected animals are placed into the plethysmography chamber and respiratory outputs are measured every two seconds for a five minute duration following a set acclimation period. Measured over a time course, the outputs include a variety of direct and derived values that indicate aspects of respiratory function including calculated airway resistance (penH), breath frequency, lung volumes, and flow rates. Together, these readouts provide a direct measure of respiratory function following viral infection and when combined with resources like the collaborative cross, generate high throughput datasets ideal for systems-based analysis.",

Flow cytometry analysis of infected lungs evaluates the composition, kinetics, and magnitude of the immune infiltrate for a wide array of immune cells. Similarly, histopathology provides information on the structural aspects of lung infiltration including airway denuding, perivascular cuffing, and hyaline membrane formation. Differences in both flow and histopathology have been previously shown to influence pathogenesis following viral infection, yet the genetic factors and host response patterns that regulate pathogenic or protective responses remain poorly understood, especially in outbred populations.

To understand these pathways requires probing the adaptive response to virus infection with systems-based analysis. However, while virus, dose, and time point are critical elements in initiating the response, a diverse genetic background is required to generate sufficient contrast to model and identify key elements of the adaptive immune response. This diverse system will be achieved with incorporation of the CC. Building on the diversity of the CC, viral specific T-cell responses from different lines will be identified by intracellular cytokine staining, surrogate activation marker identification as well as peptide tetramer staining of antigen specific T-cells; acquiring this data will identify key regulators through differential expression in the high-throughput data sets. Similarly, antibody neutralization titers and ELISA titers will be employed to distinguish genes and pathways that contribute to the end stage B-cell function.

One approach utilizes different high-throughput data types to generate common, refined targets. For example, our SARS-\u0394ORF6 studies utilized CLR-based modeling of both transcriptomics and proteomic data in order to identify transcriptional hubs regulated by karyopherins; this approach narrowed the targets and provided manageable validation avenues. Another approach seeks to examine modeling approaches across experimental systems with common biological stimuli. Studies with IAV H5N1 exemplify this approach as conservation of network modeling was observed between varying in vitro and in vivo models for interferon responses, inflammasome, and hypercytokinemia (73) . A third approach attempts to bridge varying mathematical and computational approaches to yield a more complete picture of complex biological systems. Using this method, our group combined CLR-based analysis with WGCNA module mapping to create a blended model system that helped to identify important regulators influencing pathogenesis including Tnfrsf1b and Kepi1 (McDermott et al., submitted). Another example generated metaanalysis from SARS-CoV, IAVs H5N1-VN1203, and H1N1-1918 infection data at multiple doses using statistical tests, module mapping, and Z-score based analysis (74) .

With the development and incorporation of numerous new high throughput data sources including the CC, the next leap in model design must move beyond single and dual input analysis. Incorporating multiple biological parameters is required to understand complex biological systems involved during infectious disease pathogenesis. Along with developing new models for areas like whole body plesthymography, immune infiltration, and metabolomics, systems biology teams must devote significant resources toward integrating these models with other output measures. In addition, incorporation of multiple modeling approaches will help refine and advance the responses; new algorithms like the inferelator and cross-validation approaches provide a blue-print to these advances (60, 75) . Similarly, modeling approaches including discriminant analysis via mixed integer programming (DAMIP) or principal component analysis (PCA) have been utilized by other systems biology groups with great success and could be combined with our approaches to produce more robust models of disease (14, 15) . In addition, efforts to 'train' the modeling approaches are underway, utilizing known biological signatures and datasets to help refine and improve targeting in similar, yet unknown conditions. For example, studies with SARS-CoV mutants lacking NSP16 have defined important pathways independent of any modeling approach (Menachery et al., unpublished data); these data were then used to screen the efficacy of newly developed models in order to examine other mutant viruses with similar infection kinetics. A similar approach was utilized in examination of influenza vaccine responses (15) . Together, these efforts are just a few of the ways that systems-based modeling can be refined to provide efficient, effective targeting.

However, the use of reductionist-based approaches for validation and extension are inherently limited to our areas of scientific understanding. Often, these studies utilize knockout mice, drug treatment, or other reagents previously generated in the course of reductionist-based science.

            "text": "Reductionist-based validation approaches often rely on knockout and overexpression studies to provide understanding, using the absence or overabundance of a molecule as a means to define its function. However, these types of null genetic mutation are rarely observed in nature, making it difficult to directly translate these finding into human disease models. For validation to have a translational impact on human disease, our studies must use genetic diversity to alter target gene/pathways functions rather than knockout or knockdown studies. The CC allows this type of analysis through generation of customizable recombinant inbred intercrosses (76, 77) . For example, studies with SARS-CoV have identified Serpine1, a key component of the urokinase pathway and an important player in tissue damage/repair following infection. Serpine1 deficiency results in enhanced disease and pathogenesis following SARS-CoV infection, likely due to increased lung pathology (Gralinski et al., manuscript submitted). However, the impact of these data are unclear in regards to human disease: the vast majority of people maintain functional Serpine1, but genetic diversity in this gene or region of the genome may have a significant impact on pathogenic outcomes and disease severity. To assay this possibility, we can utilize the CC to generate mouse lines with allelic diversity in this region of the genome, while maintaining genetic identity throughout the rest of the genome (Fig. 5A) . Similarly, the genome region could remain static and the background shifted to assess the impact of a specific allele. For Serpine1 in the CC, this means the possibility of examining the impact of 6 haplotypes during in vivo infection (Fig. 5B) . Importantly, other analysis can be layered onto the CC RIX experimental model including predictions based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) consequences (Fig. 5C) , structural alterations (78) (Fig. 5D) , and/or epigenetic regulatory factors. In addition, multiple genes could be analyzed in parallel to assay their allelic impact on each other; while either holding constant or randomizing the majority of the genome, allelic variants can be shuffled between the two gene regions, creating combinations to assay their interaction with each other and the global response (Fig. 5A) . For example, systems vaccinology has identified important genes impacting the antibody response (TNFRS17 & CaMKIV) and T-cell response (EIF2AK4 & C1QB) following yellow fever and influenza vaccination (15) . Using the CC, the varying allele combinations could be examined in the same background and provide a window into the interactions of different gene combinations and pathways.",

Notably, for systems biology targets, the CC allows validation of genes and pathways without the requirement of previously generated reagents alleviating one of the major issues with validation. Because the CC is based on natural genetic variation rather than genetic deletions this resource also allows for investigations into the role of genes that cannot be knocked out or knocked down in traditional validation approaches. This overcomes a major challenge of systems-based approaches, where many candidate genes cannot be targeted due to their essential function.

Moving forward, focus on clinical treatments provides both validation to systems-based targets as well as develop useful therapeutics for treating patients. To achieve this purpose, our group used functional genomics and computation biology to diagnose virus etiology, forecast disease severity in the lung, and develops a highly portable screening platform that analytically pinpoints and then tests the ability of lead compounds to attenuate virus disease (18) . Built upon a database of characterized small-molecules and FDA-approved drugs [e.g. connectivity map database (cMap), Canadian DrugBank, the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge base, etc.], the approach uses pattern recognition and multi-parametric, multi-objective optimization techniques to match gene expression changes with drug targets that possibly reverse those trends and could be repurposed for use as antiviral therapies.",

Subsequent in vitro studies would use tissue specific cell lines and primary cultures to define cell toxicity, viral replication, and host expression changes as measured by microarray. Drug targets effective in these areas would be further tested in inbred models of infection for in vivo efficacy. Finally, a diverse panel of CC mice would also be tested in order to ascertain possibility of drug failure due to genetic diversity.

Detailed transcriptomic analysis of SARS-CoV and EMC2012 host response networks had demonstrated early up regulated genes (~200) that are downstream of p38 map kinase signaling pathways. A systematic review of the FDA database indicated that SB203580, a pyridinyl imidazole inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, significantly downregulated overlapping sets of genes that are induced by high path coronaviruses (80) . To test compound effectiveness, we infected Vero cells with SARS-CoV at a MOI of 0.01 and then treated cells with type I IFN or SB203580. Importantly, SB203580 significantly reduced both EMC-CoV and SARS-CoV growth (and CPE) in culture, and in some cases, was equivalent to IFN treatment, supporting our hypothesis that lead compounds for therapeutic testing and evaluation can be identified by modeling approaches that compare contrasting expression patterns during infection and drug treatment. Further testing in tissue specific cells and in vivo continues for SB203580, but the data illustrate conceptual support for this approach. A similar method is planned for other systems biology targets suggesting that identified drugs may enhance protective responses mitigated by the Urokinase pathway (e.g. protein kinase C) or stimulate the TLR3/TLR4/ myd88 signaling pathways (e.g. TLR3-PolyIC, Poly AU, TLR4-Monophosphoryl lipid A) (81) , protecting against lethal disease.",

These factors makes treatment more difficult to prescribe as it is nearly impossible to determine the appropriate use of aggressive or conservative treatment options at early time points. While the systems biology approaches have provided identification of key pathways that play protective or pathogenic roles after infection, the next stage of development requires linking these pathway outcomes with early events to provide prognostic biomarkers to aid in treatment of disease (82) (83) (84) (85) . These studies will take advantage of the massive functional genomics data sets to identify early etiologic and prognostic signature that track with disease severity across pathogens and in vivo systems including human (PBMC), mouse, and non-human primate models. Next, natural genetic variation on biomarker sensitivity and specificity can be evaluated using resources such as the CC, a reproducible model of human genetic diversity. Finally, key validated biomarker and prognostic indicators will be integrated into assays for differential diagnosis and prognosis, linked to computational algorithms that forecast FDA drugs and other treatments that may attenuate pathogenesis. In this way, development of biomarkers via systems-based approaches has the potential to revolutionize the way human diseases are treated with an eye toward likely outcome dictating the intervention strategies.",
