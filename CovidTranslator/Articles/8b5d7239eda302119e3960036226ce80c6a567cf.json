After stress situations such as transportation, dystocias in heifers or cases of mucosal disease or immunosuppression by corticosteroid application virus is shed from the respective tract. In trials where the infection was produced by intravenous inoculation the results were different from those where the infection occurred via the natural entrances [14, 15] . The recrudescence may be influenced by the composition of the immunosuppressive corticosteroid [16] . In a recent experiment it could clearly be demonstrated that 10 heifers inoculated intranasally only shed virus from the respiratory tract when immunosuppressed [17] .",

            "text": "An early publication [2, 18] frequently resulted in the wrong conclusion. There it was shown (Fig. 1 ) that following local infection the period of virus excretion was shortened when the animals were reinfected and a certain correlation existed then between the humoral antibody titer and the days virus was excreted. The wrong interpretation claimed that a correlation existed between humoral antibodies no matter how they were obtained and the ability to shed virus. Therefore a number of experiments were conducted to prove that there is no correlation between a humoral antibody titer and the readiness to shed virus and also the duration of virus shedding following immunosuppression. Group 1 consisted of 17 animals which were latently infected following the intranasal inoculation of BHV1 field or vaccine strain and then immunosuppressed. The results are demonstrated in Fig. 2 . The animal which shed virus longest (14 days) had a fairly high titer of humoral antibodies. The same is true for 16 cattle which were first infected with field virus by the intranasal route and then twice vaccinated at 4 week intervals with inactivated BHV1 vaccine licensed in Germany. After immunosuppression, virus could be recovered for a period of 2-12 days in the presence of high humoral antibody titers (Fig. 3 ). In the third group 33 animals were twice vaccinated with inactivated BHV1 vaccines at 4 week intervals and then challenged with BHV1 field virus. Three months later immunosuppression was carried out. The results are presented in Fig. 4 . It is remarkable that some animals excreted virus for a short period of time but the majority for longer periods of time as did the animals of groups 1 and 2. A fourth group of 19 animals was vaccinated intranasally with an experimental inactivated vaccine after earlier experiments had produced encouraging results in FMD vaccine studies [19] . The animals were challenged 4 weeks later with field virus and 3 months later were immunosuppressed. The results of the virus recoveries can be seen in There is, however, a correlation between the amount of virus excreted from seronegative and seropositive cattle following challenge as numerous trials have shown [20] [21] [22] . From an epizootiological point of view this is of less importance since the infectious dose is very low [23] . In a recent experiment as yet not completed it was found that cattle vaccinated intranasally three times were most reluctant to shed virus after the application of immunosuppressive corticosteroids, even after increasing the dosage [24] .",
