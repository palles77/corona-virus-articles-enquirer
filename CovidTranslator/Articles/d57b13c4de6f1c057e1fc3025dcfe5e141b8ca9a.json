Although the governments had implemented various measures to protect their cities or countries, such like traffic restrictions, quarantine requirement for travelers, contact tracing, etc., a large-scale global movement of population have already caused rapid spread of the disease, resulting in an epidemic throughout the world. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 1 . The virus that causes COVID-19 is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads mainly from person-to-person through between people who are in close contact with one another, and through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes 2 . As the epidemic came under control in China, global spread of the COVID-19 had caused a surge in Asia, Europe, Middle East and North American. As March 11, 2020 , with the global risk continuously increased, there were already more than 118,000 cases in 114 countries and 4,291 people have lost their lives, WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic 3 .",

Mathematical models are widely used in evaluating epidemic transmissions, forecasting the trend of disease spread, and providing optimal intervention strategies and control measures. Considerable recent studies have contended to estimate COVID-19's scale and severity, several mathematical models and predicting approaches have attempted to estimate the transmission of COVID-19 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Majority of the researches estimated the basic reproductive number R 0 , a key parameter to evaluate the potential of COVID-19 transmission. However, different models often yield different conclusions in terms of differences in model structure and input parameters.

We use logistic model to predict the disease trends. The logistic model's essence is that curve fitting and its prediction results highly depend on the historical data. It has been often used in epidemics dynamics prediction in previous studies 4, 10,11 . Mathematically, the logistic model describes dynamic evolution of infected individuals being controlled by the growth rate and population capacity. According to the following ordinary differential equation (a), we will get logistic function (b), the model describes dynamic evolution of the reported number of confirmed cases P being controlled by the growth rate r, and the initial value of P 0 is the confirmed number of cases when T=0. The maximum case volume in the environment is K, which is the limit that can be reached by increasing to the final value of P \u123a t \u123b , and r is the growth rate. We used the least squares method to fit the logistic growth function, and then to predict the number of future confirmed cases. Since the case numbers reported at very early stage are usually inaccuracy or missing, the initiate date of the model was set as the day since the 100th confirmed case was reached.",

It is worth pointing out, compared with no interventions, if governments take strict control measures to reduce the movement of population, implement prompt diagnosis and isolation, the peak time will reach and the peak size would greatly decrease to a relatively low level in about 30 days and it is best triggered in early stage of the epidemic; however, it will need to be maintained several months until a vaccine From the view of mathematical models, the SEIR model is designed for infectious disease estimation, however, the logistic growth model is designed to fit the curve development. Logistic model may fit the existing data better when comparing with SEIR model since it is trained from the existing data, but it cannot be accurately judged and incorporate infectious characters.",

The models also lack enough data to estimate quarantine proportions of a certain population. Actually, the epidemic evolvement is quite complicated and our study has only taken account of a few factors. In addition, a lack of testing kits means many cases have not been tested in some countries and without robust testing, official number of cases is incomplete. When working with incomplete data, a small error in one factor can have outsize effect.",

Therefore, implementing strong containment policies during the early spreading stages of COVID-19 and flattening the peak to avoid overloading the healthcare system should be listed as the main action of these high-risk countries/regions. After the strict quarantine period, governments still need to raise the public awareness of precaution and taking self-protecting behaviors to make the epidemic under control as scattered events.

Conversely, whenever the epidemic is not end, there is still a possibility of future outbreaks if governments loosen the interventions with people returning back to close social distances. The results of spreading potentials show that R 0 of COVID-19 is high, which is similar with SARS viruses with R 0 values between 2.0 and 5.0 18 , higher of influenza viruses H1N1 with R 0 values between 1.2 and 3.7 19 , and Ebola viruses with R 0 values between 1.34 and 3.65 20 . The COVID-19 is a highly contagious human-to-human transmission disease. The R 0 is expected to decrease substantially compared to values at the early stage after the government implemented control measures, however, no matter what kind of policy each country executes, each policy has its limitation to defend COVID-19 and the sustained transmission chains will occur until there is vaccine or virus disappears with season or population immunity 21 . Therefore, detecting all transmission events are the most key issue of the COVID-19 control in current stage, because any undetected case in a local area could begin a new epidemic chain of transmission, in addition, the public should take adequate protective measures against the transmission of COVID-19.",
