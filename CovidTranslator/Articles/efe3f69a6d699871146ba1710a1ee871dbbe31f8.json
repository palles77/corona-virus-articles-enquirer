            "text": "Previously described polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to rabbit CD5, raised against expressed recombinant protein or peptides, recognize CD5 on most rabbit B cells. The mAb KEN-5 was originally reported to recognize rabbit CD5. However, KEN-5 binds almost exclusively to T cells and only to a minor population of B cells. We show here that by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), KEN-5 binds to recombinant rabbit CD5. This interaction is partially inhibited by polyclonal goat anti-CD5 antibody. In addition, immunoprecipitations from lysates of surface biotinylated rabbit lymphocytes with KEN-5 or our anti-CD5 mAb isolate molecules that migrate identically on gels with the same approximate relative molecular mass of 67,000 M r . By flow cytometric analyses of individual cells from spleen, thymus and appendix, KEN-5 recognizes CD5like molecules mainly on T cells and on 3-6% of IgM + B cells. Immunohistochemical staining of splenic and appendix tissues and confocal immunofluorescent imaging confirm and extend results from flow cytometric analyses. Quantitation of fluorescent colocalization indicates that staining by KEN-5 colocalizes with staining by anti-CD5 on small percentages lymphocytes in splenic tissue sections. As CD5 has both N-and O-linked glycosylation, we hypothesised that differential binding of KEN-5 to T cells and B-cells may be explained by different glycan structures on the CD5 present on T compared to B cells. This hypothesis is supported by ELISA data that show that deglycosylation diminishes the binding of KEN-5 to recombinant rabbit CD5. Screening KEN-5 on an array with 406 glycans was inconclusive. Although we did not identify a strongly binding glycan structure, the data are suggestive that the epitope recognized by KEN-5 may be influenced by glycan structures. The epitope this mAb recognizes may either be the glycan itself, or more likely, is influenced by neighboring glycan structure. Our findings suggest that development, selection and function of different B-and T-cell subsets or their preferential survival may be directly or indirectly dependent on different glycan structures associated with CD5 or CD5-like molecules expressed on T cells compared to B cells.",

CD5 + B cells appear to develop early in ontogeny and be maintained through life by self-renewal (Pospisil et al., 2006) . Our earlier studies suggested that CD5 is an endogenous ligand that participates in \"superantigen-like\" interactions with the surface immunoglobulins on rabbit B cells. We proposed that there is preferential expansion and survival of rabbit B cells based on interaction of CD5 with Ig heavy chain variable regions (VH) and a role for specific structures associated with rabbit VHaallotypes in framework regions (FR1 and FR3) . Rhee et al. (2005) provided further support for a role for superantigen-like interactions with VH during early expansion of B-cell repertoires in rabbit gut associate lymphoid tissues via endogenous and bacterial superantigens. We also extended the observations in rabbits to studies of potential influences of CD5 on development of normal and pathological human B-cells through interactions with human VH .",

The antibody (KEN-5 sc-59373 IgG1, 200 \u03bcg/ml from Santa Cruz Biotech.) was diluted to 5 \u03bcg/ml in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20, and in a second experiment diluted to 180 \u03bcg/ml with 10% BSA. An aliquot (70 \u03bcl) was applied to microarray slides, and incubated under a coverslip for 60 min at room temperature in a humidified chamber away from light. Coverslips were then removed and slides were washed by dipping four times in successive washes of TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, TBS and deionized water. For detection of KEN-5 binding, slides were similarly incubated with Alexa-488-labeled goat anti-mouse-IgG secondary antibody (5 \u03bcg/ml, Invitrogen) for 60 min at room temperature and washed as above. Slides were then spun for approximately 15 s to dry and immediately scanned in a PerkinElmer ProScanArray MicroArray Scanner using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and ImaGene software (BioDiscovery) to quantify fluorescence. The data are reported as average relative fluorescence units of four of six replicates (after removal of the highest and lowest values) for each glycan represented on the array. Figure 1 shows that molecules of 67 kilodaltons were identified by SDS-PAGE and streptavidin-peroxidase chemiluminescence analyses of molecules isolated from surface biotinylated rabbit splenocytes by immunoprecipitation with KEN-5 (first two lanes) and with anti-D2 mAb 5A7 (third and fourth lanes). An identically migrating major band with a relative molecular mass of approximately 67,000 M r , was immunoprecipitated from lysates of biotinylated lymphocytes from rabbit appendix and thymus. In contrast to KEN5, 5A7 mAb also detected another minor high molecular weight band. Although the mAbs we developed against peptides from the D1, D2 or D3 domains of rabbit CD5 and polyclonal goat antibodies detected rCD5 by Western blotting (Pospisil et al., 2005) , we were not able to detect rCD5 using KEN-5 on Western blots (data not shown).",

Supplemental Figure 1 summarizes the results of quantitative colocalization analyses. Panel A shows colocalization measurements for CD5 (5A7 or 4D8) and KEN-5. Depending on from where in the spleen a particular section derived, the percentage of red CD5 and green KEN-5 colocalization ranged from 0.5 -21%. There was excellent correlation of the determined percentage of colocalization whether red (CD5) or green (KEN-5) was masked to set the limit on background fluorescence. Panels B and C show the colocalization of IgM staining with CD5 and KEN-5. Again, the percentage of red CD5 (Panel B) and percent of CD5 colocalized with IgM correlated well both in regions of the spleen with high percentages of B cells and regions with fewer IgM + B cells. The data in panel C confirm that low percentages (1.5-13%) of cells that stain with anti-IgM also stain with KEN-5. In order to further investigate colocalization, serial stacked confocal images were used to model a stained sample in three dimensions. Supplemental movie 1 shows a three dimensional model reconstructed from nine confocal sequential sections (1\u03bc) in a region of spleen at an interface of mainly T cells stained with green KEN-5 or IgM + B cells shown in white where some cells also stain with anti-CD5 mAb 4D8 (red). Volume is shown in a color transparent model, while the surface model is a colored solid surface object created based on sample intensity threshold. In a transparent volume model, we can see the blue DAPI-stained nuclei of individual B cells (IgM + ) or KEN-5 + T cells and red staining with mAb 4D8 with very little yellow staining, again suggesting that the KEN-5 epitope (green) is largely present on a different cell type compared to the epitope recognized by anti-CD5 antibodies (red).",

Our own mouse mAbs to rabbit CD5 peptide sequences and goat polyclonal antibodies to expressed recombinant rabbit CD5 also weakly stain T cells in the interfollicular regions of appendix follicles (Pospisil et al., 2005) . In the spleen, the reagents stain both T-and B-cells in the follicles and single splenic lymphocytes in red pulp. In contrast to the observations made using known anti-rabbit CD5, mAb KEN-5 recognizes only a small proportion of IgM + B cells by flow cytometric analyses of thymic and appendix lymphocytes, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining (Figs. 2, 3 and 4) . In spleen, most B cells that stain with anti-CD79a on the sections, are KEN-5 negative (Fig. 3A) . Immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy allowed us to quantitate colocalization of double positive cells in sections of spleen where T-cell and B-cell areas can be identified. These observations also suggest that KEN-5 may recognize an epitope present on CD5 or a CD5-like molecule present on most rabbit T-cells that is only detectable on a small proportion of CD5 positive B cells (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. 1 ). When we blocked KEN-5 staining with polyclonal goat anti-CD5 (Fig. 2B) , the percentage of double positive KEN-5 + /KEN-4 + (CD4 + ) T cells detected by flow cytometry diminished significantly compared to KEN-5 + / IgM + double positive B cells. There is something different about the molecules that KEN-5 recognizes on T cells and those the other antibodies recognize on B cells in spite of the fact that rCD5 reacts with all these antibodies. In order to determine whether there was a second closely related gene present in the rabbit genome, we searched the 7 \u00d7 trace archives of rabbit genome sequence but found no evidence for a second copy of rabbit CD5.",

            "text": "Since CD5 has both N-and O-linked glycosylation, we hypothesized that differential binding of KEN-5 to T-and B-cells may be explained by different glycan structures on the CD5 present on T-compared to B-cells. The recombinant CD5 was expressed in S2 insect cells so would not be expected to have glycans identical to those present on endogenous proteins expressed by rabbit T-or B-lymphocytes (Schwientek et al., 2007 and reviewed in Rendic et al,, 2008) . Since glycosylation by rabbit cells is expected to be significantly different from the glycosylation system of the S2 insect cells that produced rCD5, the epitope recognized by KEN-5 may be a conformational protein epitope that requires glycosylation to preserve its configuration. T-cell glycosylation may differ from B-cell glycosylation and thus contribute to the differential KEN-5 reactivity with CD5 of T-and B-cells. Deglycosylation of the rCD5 (Fig. 6A ) had little effect on reactivity of our known anti-CD5 reagents (Fig. 6B ) but did diminish binding of KEN-5 (Fig. 6C ) to various forms of deglycosylated rCD5. However, neither studies of KEN-5 binding to earlier carbohydrate microarrays constructed by D.Wang's group at Stanford University (Wang et al., 2002; Wang and Lu, 2004) nor the recent analysis using the Consortium for Functional Glycomics glycan array with 406 probes http://www.functionalglycomics.org/glycomics/search/jsp/result.jsp? comment=KEN-5&cat=all, identified a specific glycan that bound KEN-5. According to the original report (Kotani et al., 1993 and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, data sheet) , mAb KEN-5 recognizes more that 90% of rabbit thymocytes and 40-45% of mesenteric lymph node cells and there is little evidence of B cell activity (Davis and Hamilton, 2008 and this study) . Although KEN-5 was originally thought to recognize rabbit CD5, it did not bind to mouse A20 B cells transfected with the full length rabbit CD5 construct described by Raman and Knight, (1992) ",

Cell binding of a recombinant soluble human CD5 extracellular domain glycoprotein (rsCD5) was inhibited by high molar concentrations of some monosaccharides. Human CD5 Ig fusion proteins and a natural soluble CD5 form similarly bind a cell surface receptor expressed on monocytes, lymphocytes and various cell lines of lymphoid, myelomonocytic and epithelial origin (Calvo et al., 1999) . Recently Vera et al., (2009) reported that membrane-bound human CD5 itself binds to \u03b2-D-glucans and products from fungal cell walls such as zymosan.

The regulation of CD5 expression is likely to be a key event in lymphocyte maintenance and homeostasis. In mouse, the B-1 CD5 + cell phenotype may be directly associated with the strength of BCR-induced intracellular signals and might reflect a dependence of these cells on positive selection by self antigens (Lam and Rajewsky, 1999) . We previously suggested that one or more activation signals lead to CD5 B-cell development and that CD5 on B cells affects selective expansion of certain subsets of normal B cells and pathologic human B cells such as the CD5 positive cells that develop into B-CLL Pospisil et al., 2005; 2006) . Recently an inhibitory role for CD5 leading to dampening of mouse T-regulatory cell function has been demonstrated (Dasu et al., 2008) . The results reported here suggest that mAb KEN-5 distinguishes CD5-isoforms present among T-and B-cell lineages in rabbit. CD5isoforms may play roles in the development, selection and function of different B-and T-cell subsets or their preferential survival. The development, selection and function of different Band T-cell subsets or their preferential survival may be directly or indirectly dependent on different glycan structures associated with CD5 or CD5-like molecules expressed on T cells compared to B cells.",

Labeled cells were visualized by Vector blue alkaline phosphatase substrate kit III (blue). Arrows in high magnification images from A, point to infrequently observed double positive cells stained by both KEN-5 (brown) and for CD79a (blue). B. Macrophages surrounding follicles were first stained with mouse anti-Macrophage mAb followed by biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody and ABC-Peroxidase kit. Labeled cells were visualized by ABC-DAB substrate kit III. Sections were then incubated with mouse anti-rabbit CD5 mAb (2B10, anti-D2) followed by biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. Labelled cells were visualized by Vector blue alkaline phosphatase substrate kit III and counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red. ELISA results of KEN-5 mAb binding to rCD5 and inhibition by anti-CD5. A. KEN-5 and anti-CD5 antibodies bind to rCD5 coated on the plate. The titrated antibodies tested were: goatanti-rabbit CD5; mAb KEN-5; and mAbs against peptides in extracellular domains D1, D2 and D3 of CD5, 5H9; 2G11; 1D10, respectively. B. Inhibition of KEN-5 and anti-CD5 binding to rCD5 coated on the plate by polyclonal goat anti-rabbit CD5. For inhibition tests, the amount of each antibody was chosen to correspond to the linear portion of the curves in A (0.16 for 2G11 and 1D10, 0.08 for KEN5 and 5H9, and 0.02 for goat anti-CD5).",
