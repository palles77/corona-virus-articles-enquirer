The peptide inhibited the reaction of polyclonal anti-SEA or anti-SEB antisera with their homologous enterotoxin, thus showing that the chosen epitopes are part of the antibody-inducing enterotoxin sequences. Two Mabs, Mab-A and Mab-B, reacted with both the peptide and with either SEA or SEB. Used in a double antibody sandwich ELISA, the Mabs were able to quantitate the native SEA or SEB toxins at nanogram levels. 0 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

            "text": "from Waters Ltd. (Mississauga, ON). This report describes the production of anti-SEA and anti-SEB Mabs. The immunogen used was not native SE but rather a synthetic peptide containing SEA and SEB amino acid sequences corresponding to predicted antigenic epitopes (Singh and Betley, 1989; Singh et al., 1988 The primary structure of the peptide contains the first eight N-terminal amino acids from SEA, a spacer of four glycine residues, and a sequence of amino acids 67 to 74 from SEB i.e. SEKSEEING-GGGKNKDLADK and is thereafter abbreviated A-G4-B. For conjugation with carrier proteins, two identical A-G4-B peptides were synthesized with a cysteine added to either the N-terminal or C-terminal part of the molecule. A glycine molecule acted as a spacer between the added cystein and the rest of the molecule. For inhibition studies the peptide was synthesized without the cysteine and glycine residues. The peptides were manufactured by Vetrogen Corp. (London, ON). All the peptides were purified to more than 95% homogeneity by reverse phase HPLC on a 5 X 4.6 cm Supelcosil LC-318 column. Elution was achieved by a O-100% gradient of acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Amino acid analysis was performed after hydrolysis of peptides in 6N HCl (containing 0.05% phenol) at 110\u00b0C for 48 h, followed by HPLC chromatography on a 15 cm X 4.6 mm Supelcosil LC-DABS column with 25 mM KH,PO,, pH 7.0 and acetonitril/methanol (70:30) as mobile phase. The results confirmed the expected amino acid composition.",

To produce Mabs reacting with SEA or SEB we used a synthetic peptide containing two putative immunogenic regions from SEA and SEB sequences which were spaced by four glycine residues. Reactivity of A-G4-B peptide with anti-SEA or anti-SEB antisera was tested in competitive inhibition experiments. The reactivity of polyclonal rabbit anti-SEA and anti-SEB antisera with the native SE was reduced following pre-treatment with the peptide as evidenced by reduction in ELISA titer. This fact demonstrates that each SEA-derived and SEB-derived sequence from the A-G6B peptide was recognized and reacted with antibodies present in the respective polyclonal antisera. As expected, inhibition of anti-SEA or anti-SEB antisera with homologous native SE was more evident than in the case of A-G4-B peptide (Fig. 1) .",

SEB and SEC l-3 also show important sequence homology (Micusan and Thibodeau, 1993; Bohach and Schlievert, 1987) . However, the SEB sequence of A-GbB peptide is quite different from that corresponding to SEC l-3 and the peptide did not inhibit the reaction between anti-SEC1 antiserum and SEC1 (data not shown). The above findings strongly suggest that the A-G4-B peptide contains epitopes similar to those in native SEA or SEB which are recognized by antibodies present in the polyclonal antisera. However, the relatively reduced inhibition of the reaction between the antisera and their homologous enterotoxins by the A-G6B peptide indicates that the sequences chosen might not be major antigenic determinants.

Besides the low cost, the main advantage of this method is the high purity of Mabs obtained compared to the ascites fluid method which often contains natural anti-SE antibodies, thus reducing the specificity characteristic of Mabs (personal observation). Both Mabs were of IgG,, K isotype. Titration curves of Mab-A and Mab-B were performed by ELISA on Immulon-4 microplates coated with either A-G4-B peptide or SEA and SEB. Both Mabs reacted more strongly with the peptide than with native homologous SE (Fig. 2) . This finding is often observed in producing antibodies to peptides. Because of conformational changes imposed by the folding of the polypeptide chain, antibodies generated by peptides may react less or fail to react with native protein (Jemmerson and Blankenfield, 1989) . For the same concentrations of SEA or SEB coated on microtiter plates, Mab-A gave always a higher OD,,, signal than Mab-B even though tested in equivalent concentrations. In this context, previous studies have shown that accessible and flexible protein regions, such as N-or C-terminal regions, are the sites most likely to react with anti-peptide antibodies (Hopp, 1986; Dyson et al., 1988 ",

However, because of the high sequence similarities between SEA, SED and SEE and between SEB and SECl-3, some Mabs have exhibited cross-reactivity with several SE (Lapeyre et al., 1987; Edwin et al., 1986; Goyache et al., 1992) .

The latter may be obtained only after screening many hybridoma clones or with polyclonal antisera after intensive absorption with undesired SE.
