            "text": "The outbreak of COVID-19 has now become a global pandemic and it continues to spread rapidly worldwide, severely threatening lives and economic stability. Making the problem worse, there is no specific antiviral drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 to date. SARS-CoV-2 initiates its entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein. Therefore, molecules that can block SARS-CoV-2 from binding to hACE2 may potentially prevent the virus from entering human cells and serve as an effective antiviral drug. Based on this idea, we designed a series of peptides that can strongly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD in computational experiments. Specifically, we first constructed a 31mer peptidic scaffold by linking two fragments grafted from hACE2 (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) with a linker glycine, and then redesigned the peptide sequence to enhance its binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Compared with several computational studies that failed to identify that SARS-CoV-2 shows higher binding affinity for hACE2 than SARS-CoV, our protein design scoring function, EvoEF2, makes a correct identification, which is consistent with the recently reported experimental data, implying its high accuracy. The top designed peptide binders exhibited much stronger binding potency to hACE2 than the wild-type (-53.35 vs. -46.46 EvoEF2 energy unit for design and wild-type, respectively). The extensive and detailed computational analyses support the high reasonability of the designed binders, which not only recapitulated the critical native binding interactions but also introduced new favorable interactions to enhance binding. Due to the urgent situation created by COVID-19, we share these computational data to the community, which should be helpful to develop potential antiviral peptide drugs to combat this pandemic. : bioRxiv preprint 13 exposed to the bulk solvent. The three glycine residues, including the one that was artificially introduced, were conserved probably due to the narrow space at these positions.",

As of March 28, 2020, there have been more than 570000 confirmed cases and over 26000 deaths caused by COVID-19 worldwide 2 . Exacerbating the problem, there is no specific antiviral medication toward COVID-19, though development efforts are underway [3] [4] [5] [6] . Although vaccines are thought to be the most powerful weapon to fight against virus invasion, it may take quite a long time to develop and clinically test the safety of a vaccine. Moreover, vaccines are usually limited as preventative measures given to uninfected individuals. Thus, as an emergency measure, it is desirable to develop effective antiviral therapeutics that can take effect rapidly not only to treat COVID-19 and but also to prevent its further transmission.",

            "text": "It has been confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 initiates its entry into host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein 7, 8 . Therefore, it is possible to develop new therapeutics to block SARS-CoV-2 from binding to ACE2. Although small molecule compounds are commonly preferred as therapeutics, they are not effective at blocking protein-protein interactions (PPIs) where a deep binding pocket may be missing at the interface 9 . On the contrary, peptide binders are more suitable for disrupting PPIs by specifically binding to the interface binding region 10 . More importantly, small peptides have reduced immunogenicity 11 . These positive features make peptides great candidates to serve as therapeutics 12, 13 . Recently, Zhang et al 14 reported that the natural 23-mer peptide (a.a. cut from the human ACE2 (hACE2) \u03b11 helix can strongly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with a disassociation constant (Kd) of 47 nM, which was comparable to that of the full-length hACE2 .

[27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] from the same helix was not able to bind the virus RBD at all. In an earlier report, Han et al 16 performed a study to identify the critical determinants on hACE2 for SARS-CoV entry, and they found that two natural peptides from hACE2 (a.a. 22-44 and 22-57) exhibited a modest antiviral activity to inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV RBD to hACE2 with IC50 values of about 50 \u03bcM and 6 \u03bcM, respectively, implying that the peptide composed of residues 22-57 had stronger binding affinity for SARS-CoV RBD. They also generated a hybrid peptide by linking two discontinuous fragments from hACE2 (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) with a glycine, and this 31-mer exhibited a potent antiviral activity with an IC50 of about 0.1 \u03bcM, indicating that this artificial peptide had much stronger binding affinity for SARS-CoV RBD than the peptides composed of residues 22-44 or 22-57. Due to the high similarity of the binding interfaces between SARS-CoV RBD/hACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD/hACE2, we think that this artificial peptide may also bind to SARS-CoV-2 more strongly than the peptide 21-43 tested by Zhang et al 14 , which is similar to the peptide 22-44 from Han et al 16 . Although the natural peptides are promising, it has been argued that the sequence of hACE2 is suboptimal for binding the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 17 . Therefore, further redesign of the natural peptides may significantly enhance its binding affinity to the virus RBD and the improved peptide binders may have the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 from entering human cells and hinder its rapid transmission.",

A simulated annealing Monte Carlo (SAMC) 27 protocol was used to search for low total energy sequences as previously described 18 .

Thus, the results suggest that good binders showed a high similarity to the wild-type, but the similarity should not be too high in order to leave room for the designs to be improved. This is in line with the common thinking that the critical binding residues (i.e. hot spot residues) should be conserved while some other residues can be mutated to enhance binding.

To check this point, we used an artificial neural network-based secondary structure predictor 28 implemented in EvoDesign to predict the secondary structure of the designed peptides; the predictor that we used here was much faster than some other state-of-the-art predictors, e.g. PSIPRED 35 and PSSpred 36 , but showed similar performance 28 . To quantify the similarity between the secondary structure of a designed peptide and that of the wild-type, we calculated the secondary structure match rate, which was defined as the ratio of the number of residues with correctly assigned secondary structure elements (i.e. helix, strand and coil) to the total number of residues (i.e. 31). As shown in Figure 2F , 892 out of the 992 designed peptides had >90% secondary structure elements predicted to be identical to that of the wild-type peptide, indicating the high accuracy of the designs, although the EvoEF2 scoring function does not include any explicit secondary structure-related energy terms 18 .",

For this design, T27 was mutated to isoleucine ( Figure 3B ). In the wild-type structure, the threonine was enveloped by four hydrophobic residues on SARS-CoV-2 RBD (i.e. Y489, F456, Y473 and A475), but its hydroxyl group did not form any hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of either Y489 or Y473, and the mutation enhanced the favorable burial of nonpolar groups. The interface residue H34 was substituted for asparagine ( Figure 3B ), introducing a hydrogen bond to Y453 on SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Additionally, two mutations, F28Q and Q24E, simultaneously formed hydrogen bonds with the amide group of N487 from SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( Figure 3C ). Although the mutation D355H did not form hydrogen bonds with any residues from SARS-CoV-2, it simultaneously formed two hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of Y41 and the main-chain carbonyl group of G45 on the peptide, which may help stabilize the loop region (a.a. 351-357).",

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 28.013607 doi: bioRxiv preprint In previous studies, we found that evolutionary information can facilitate the design of proteins, improving their ability to fold into desired structures 28, 38 . To examine whether the evolutionary profile is important for peptide design here, we also performed four sets of designs with different weight settings for the evolution energy; for each design set, 1000 independent design simulation trajectories were carried out and the unique sequences out of the 1000 lowest energy designs were analyzed (Table 2 ). In general, giving a higher weight to the evolutionary energy facilitated the convergence of the design simulations, as indicated by the fewer unique designed sequences. It also helped identify sequences that were closer to the wild-type peptide as demonstrated by the higher sequence identities and the lower average evolutionary energy, which were both much more similar to those of the wild-type than the designs created using the physical score alone. We also found that incorporation of the profile energy moderately increased the ability of the designed sequences to maintain the original secondary structure. However, despite these improvements, giving a higher value to the profile weight clearly hindered the identification of binders that exhibited better binding energy than the wild-type. We performed sequence logo analyses of the four sets of designs obtained from the evolutionbased method and the results are illustrated in Figure 4 . Overall, the evolutionary profile did not have a dramatic effect on most interface residues (e.g. Q24, K31, H34, E35, E37, D38, Y41, Q42 and K353), because the dominating residue types identified in the EvoEF2-based designs were also top ranked ( Figure 3A and Figure 4 ). However, some interface residues were indeed influenced. For instance, T27 could be substituted for either lysine or isoleucine without evolution ( Figure 3A ), but it was only mutated to lysine when the evolutionary weight was \u22650.75 ( Figure   4C -D). Additionally, without evolutionary profiles, F28 preferred glutamine over all other residues ( Figure 3A ), but it was conserved as phenylalanine when the evolutionary weight was \u22650.5 ( Figure   4B -D). The naturally occurring residues, glutamic acid and arginine never appeared at positions 335 and 337, respectively, without evolutionary profile-guided design ( Figure 3A) ; however, both of them were ranked second when a weight of 1.0 was given to the profiles. The residues that were most affected by evolution were those nonpolar residues that were not at the interface (e.g. A25, L29, F32, A36, L39, L351 and F356); without the evolutionary profile, polar or charged residue types were preferred at these positions ( Figure 3A) , while nonpolar residues were more frequently chosen for most of them when the weight of the profile energy was high ( Figure 4B-D) . As discussed above, most of these residues were buried in the original hACE2 structure, but they were solvent exposed in the peptide, and therefore it might not be necessary to maintain the hydrophobic nature at these positions.
