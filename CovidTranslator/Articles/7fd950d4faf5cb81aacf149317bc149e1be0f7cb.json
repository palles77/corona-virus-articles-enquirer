The plasma amino acid concentrations, like other metabolites, have distinctive features for various physiological conditions. Some diseases such as liver failure (Holm et al., 1999) , renal failure (Hong et al., 1998) , cancer (Watanabe et al., 1984) , diabetes (Watanabe et al., 1983) , muscle dysfunction (Jimenez Jimenez et al., 1991) and aminoacidemia (Tudor et al., 1976) have been reported to have specific abnormalities in plasma amino acid profiles. There are some studies which make use of plasma amino acid profiles to diagnosis and distinguish abnormal subjects from healthy subjects, or subtypes and stages of diseases (Noguchi et al., 2006) . One of the traditional examples of using plasma amino acid profiles for diagnostic markers is the Fisher's ratio, which is a ratio of branched-chain amino acids to aromatic amino acids and is used for the marker of liver fibrosis (Ferenci and Wewalka, 1978; Soeters and Fischer, 1976) . These studies clearly show that plasma amino acid profile itself can be a useful tool for monitoring the physiological state of an organism.",

Further investigations on the control mechanism of plasma amino acids should uncover the trigger reasons for diseases or propose a new treatment to improve the physiological conditions, however, the control mechanism is so complicated that the investigations have not been succeeded. The reasons for this complexity should come from the interrelatedness of the amino acids and a number of internal and external factors affecting their concentrations. Amino acids are directly and indirectly related to each other within a large metabolic pathway and their concentrations in the plasma are equivalent to the whole sum of the metabolic flow in each organs and tissues. The metabolic flow in organs and tissues are affected by various factors such as nutrition, diseases, exercise, and body composition, and so does the plasma amino acid profile. Also, there are still unknown metabolic pathways, which are being discovered not only experimentally but also with using automated methods (Chou et al., 2006) . From these reasons, the changes in the concentrations of plasma amino acids can not be simply explained by the topological network structure of metabolic pathway map.",

In this study, we carried out the network analysis one step further and introduced the directional relationship between plasma amino acids. For this purpose, we used plasma amino acid profile data of rats fed on a single amino acid-deficient (minus-one) diet. In this experimental model, the plasma concentration of deficient amino acid decreases drastically, which also affects the concentration of other amino acids. This resembles the changes observed in the gene expression profile of single gene knock-out models (Yeang et al., 2005) . Taking advantage of this resemblance, the methods used for inferring gene expression network structure are adopted in this study for inferring the interrelated and directional network structure of plasma amino acids without considering any prior topological information on metabolic pathways. This data driven analysis should lead us to the further understanding of the dynamics of the plasma amino acid profiles and gives us some clues for the factors affecting the interrelated network under various physiological conditions.",

Starting from 10 weeks of age, the rats were randomly assigned and switched to control or one of the experimental diets (n \u00bc 6 each). The composition of the diet is based on AIN93G standard diet, slightly modified by replacing dextrin and sucrose by corn starch, and casein by amino acid mixture shown in Table 1 . Each experimental diet (minus-one diet) is completely depleted of single essential amino acids; histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine. The rats fed branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) minus-one diets were kept for 5 weeks, and those fed other essential amino acid (EAA) minus-one diets were kept for 15 weeks under ad libitum feeding condition. Rats were sacrificed 3 h after feeding and blood samples were collected from postcaval vein and mixed with EDTA immediately to prevent coagulation. The plasma separated from the blood samples are mixed with 2 volumes of 5% (w=w) trichloroacetic acid, and centrifuged immediately at 4 C, 8000 \u00c2 g for 20 minutes. The supernatant was filtrated with Ultrafree-MC filter (Cat. No. UFC3LGC00, Millipore), and the amino acid concentrations were measured by an automatic amino acid analyzer (L-8800; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).",

Using graphic approach or diagraph method to study biology-related can make the problem more intuitive, facilitating illustration and stimulating imagination so as to help reveal the essence of the problem concerned. Graphic approach has been successfully used to study enzyme-catalyzed system (Chou, 1981 (Chou, , 1989 Chou and Liu, 1981; Kuzmic et al., 1992; Lin and Neet, 1990) , protein folding kinetics (Chou, 1990) , HIV reverse transcriptase inhibition mechanisms (Althaus et al., 1993a, b, c; Chou et al., 1994) , and analysis of base frequencies in the anti-sense strands of human protein coding sequences (Zhang and Chou, 1996) . Recently, the images of cellular automata were used to investigate HBV virus gene missense mutation (Xiao et al., 2005a) , HBV viral infections (Xiao et al., 2006b) , represent biological sequences (Xiao et al., 2005b) , predict protein subcellular location (Xiao et al., 2006a) , and analyze the fingerprint of SARS coronavirus (Wang et al., 2005) . Our strategy for the inference of interrelated amino acid networks can be summarized as follow: (1) Given data of fold-change in concentration of deficiency or over-consumption in one essential amino acid under the stationary state, the threshold-test analysis method is applied to infer binary relationships between target amino acids. (2) The multi-level digraph analysis method infers consistent minimal binary relationships starting from many binary relationships derived from the threshold-test analysis method.",

These relations describe the effects of one amino acid on the concentration of the other amino acids and are mainly provided by the changes in the state of amino acid concentrations (Fig. 1) . Upon setting an arbitrary threshold value of concentration ratio, one can extract binary relations between two amino acids directly by estimation of the relative change in concentration ratios (y F ) or by the statistical probability of change in average concentrations (y P ) from deficiency or over-consumption in one essential amino acid experimental data. The following method is explained using the concen-tration ratios (y F ) as an example. A set of amino acids is defined as S \u00bc fa; b; c; . . .g. We assume here experiments are those of deficiency or over-consumption of one essential amino acid, and that the measurements of concentrations of many amino acids are performed simultaneously. The change in concentration of the amino acids resulting from the deficiency or over-consumption of one target amino acid relative to its concentration under normal conditions (control of amino acids) is examined and recorded. This change may be recorded as an increase, decrease, or no change. An concentration ratio matrix, E, is created from a set of deficiency in one amino acid (or over-consumption) experiments, in which each matrix element represents the real-valued ratio of amino acid concentration. For instance, the value of matrix element E\u00f0a; b\u00de indicates the relative change (the concentration ratio) in concentration of amino acid 'b' in comparison to its concentration under control conditions caused by the deficiency (or over-consumption) in amino acid 'a'. Thus the matrix E is defined as E \u00bc f\u00f0a; b\u00de; . . .g. The inference procedures of this network model are as follows: (0) Obtain the concentration ratio matrix E using several sets of the amino acid concentrations resulting from deficiency or over-consumption of one essential amino acid. (1) Using the concentration ratio matrix E, we determine whether a given amino acid affects another given amino acid. For example, if, following the deficiency of amino acid 'a', the ratio of amino acid 'b' becomes higher than a given threshold value (specifically, more than y F -times higher), or becomes lower than a given threshold value (specifically, less than 1=y F -times lower) we say that amino acid 'a' affects amino acid 'b' directly or indirectly, and the value of element (a, b) in the binary matrix R is set to 1; R(a, b) \u00bc 1.",

In these experiments the genes whose expression levels were altered are suggested to be directly or indirectly regulated by the disrupted genes. Similarly, the amino acids whose plasma concentration changed under minus-one condition are suggested to be directly or indirectly regulated by the deficient amino acid.

When rats are fed minus-one diet, they will respond by changing their metabolic flow, to save and recycle the limited amino acid (Kimball, 2002) and compensate for the shortage by making use of internal amino acid pool, such as skeletal muscle (Kadowaki and Kanazawa, 2003) . In this regulation of metabolic rate, threonine might play an important role. The concentration of threonine rises in any amino acid minus-one condition, except for threonine minus-one. Thus it is highly possible that threonine may be used to regulate the pathway which will be needed in any essential amino acid shortages.",

            "text": "As shown in Fig. 6 , we can speculate that threonine gives positive influence to methionine, and methionine gives negative influence to threonine. These positive and negative interactions make up a loop which causes the temporal oscillatory behavior of the threonine-methionine concentration. This kind of oscillation can play a role in a trigger switch in a biological system. One of the mutual relationships that link threonine and methionine is the common catabolic pathway downstream of 2-oxobutanoate. Threonine is deaminated to form 2-oxobutanoate (Kapke and Davis, 1976; Scarselli et al., 2003) , and methionine forms 2-oxobutanoate via L-homocysteine and cystathionine . This can partly explain the positive effect of threonine on methionine. When the concentration of plasma threonine decreases, the concentrations of 2-oxobutanoate may also decrease and the methionine catabolism may be stimulated. Cystathionine beta-synthase usually catalyzes the reaction of replacing beta-OH of serine by homocysteine, however, it is reported that threonine can be substituted for serine in this reaction forming 3-methylcystathionine (Borcsok and Abeles, 1982) . Cystathionine beta-synthase is a key enzyme in methionine metabolism which directs the metabolite flux towards catabolic trans-sulfuration pathway rather than methionine recycling salvage pathway (Banerjee and Zou, 2005) . The fact that threonine can be a counter substrate for this enzyme indicates the possibility of threonine having direct regulatory effect on methionine metabolism. Another possible link between threonine and methionine is vitamin B12. There are two enzymes which require vitamin B12, L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthase. L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase catalyzes the conversion of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. L-methylmalonyl-CoA is one of the metabolites of threonine. Methionine synthase catalyzes the conversion of 5-CH 3 -tetrahydrofolate and homocysteine to tetrahydrofolate and methionine, respectively Watanabe and Nakano, 1999) . This may be a clue which explains the negative effect of methionine to threonine.",

It is constructed without any prior topological information of the amino acid metabolic pathway, however, it is notable that some relations in the model, such as the direct relation of phenylalanine to tyrosine, can be explained by the pathway map. By comparing and integrating snapshots taken under various conditions, we can refine and validate the estimated network structure of the plasma amino acid.",
