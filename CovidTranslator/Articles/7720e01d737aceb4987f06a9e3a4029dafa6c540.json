            "text": "To determine the prevalence of antibodies to feline coronavirus (FCoV) serotypes 1 and 2 in Switzerland and their association with different disease manifestations, a serological study based on immunofluorescence tests was conducted with Swiss field cats using transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), FCoV type 1 and FCoV type 2 as antigens. A total of 639 serum samples collected in the context of different studies from naturally infected cats were tested. The current study revealed that, with an apparent prevalence of 83%, FCoV serotype 1 is the most prevalent serotype in Switzerland. FCoV type 1 viruses induced higher antibody titers than FCoV type 2, and were more frequently associated with clinical signs and/or feline infectious peritonitis. The antibody development in seven cats experimentally infected with FCoV type 1 revealed that, with progressing duration of infection, antibodies to FCoV type 1 significantly increased over those to FCoV type 2. There was a significant relationship between antibody titers against TGEV, FCoV 1, and FCoV 2 and TGEV antigen detected the highest proportion of seropositive cats. We conclude that a vaccine against FCoV should be based on FCoV type 1-related antigens and that for serodiagnosis of FCoV infection TGEV should be used to attain the highest diagnostic efficiency. When serology is used in addition to clinical signs, hematology, and clinical chemistry results as an aid to diagnose clinical FIP, TGEV shows a diagnostic efficiency equal to that of a FCoV antigen.",

Most FCoV mutants do not cause clinical signs, although present at high viral loads; only sporadically mutants are pathogenic and induce FIP (28) . In some cases, FCoV infection was found to induce mild enteric symptoms (27, 39) . It was postulated earlier that harmless FCoVs were restricted to the intestinal tract and that FIP development would result from the capability of a virus mutant to induce systemic infection (33) . In the meantime, it was demonstrated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR that FCoV generally induces systemic infection (10, 24, 28) . Moreover, FCoV and FIPV have remained serologically and genetically indistinguishable.",

The serological distinction of FCoV type 1 from type 2 is most likely associated with differences in the S gene sequence as monoclonal antibodies to the S protein readily differentiate the FCoV subtypes (20) . Furthermore, FCoV types 1 and 2 have a different cell tropism which can be explained by changes in the S protein binding to different receptors as demonstrated previously (18) . Cats recovering from FCoV infection develop especially high titers against the S protein. Many new strains have recently been isolated (1, 4, 15, 17, 25, 35) and phylogenetic examination suggests a spectrum of strains ranging from very feline-like to more canine-like rather than two distinct serotypes (1, 4, 25) .

It suggests that during the early phase of the infection cross-reacting epitopes of both types are responsible for comparable titers. From this experiment we conclude that the B lymphocytes involved undergo constant stimulation resulting in increasing concentrations of antibodies and affinity maturation (29) leading to ever higher antibody specificity to the infecting agent, i.e., to FCoV 1 over FCoV 2. Hence, a serological differentiation between antibodies to FCoVs 1 and 2 may not be possible in the early phase of infection but only after the infection has resulted in an increase of antibody concentration and specificity.",

We now report a FCoV seroprevalence of 50% in healthy Swiss cats; this is more than twofold higher than what we had found in a study in 1987 (27) . Explanations for this increase include differences in sample selection and/or serologic tests. While in the earlier study, TGEV slides were used, we now compared TGEV with FCoV type 1 and 2 slides; all three antigens gave comparable results. Therefore, the prevalence increase cannot be attributed to the antigens used. In both studies, the criteria for sample submission were identical, i.e., the veterinarians submitted samples from which they had a personal interest in obtaining the results. The two studies were similar with respect to the origin of the samples (single versus multicat households).

Among the cats with identical titers to both serotypes the majority (59%) had high titers (\u05461,600). This may reflect coinfection by both serotypes. Alternatively, it could be explained by an infection caused by a strain not identical but immunologically equally related to both strains used in the current study. Additionally, equal titers to both FCoV types could also be ex- plained by antibodies against other structural proteins present in both viruses, such as the M and N proteins. Based on the assumption that the virus serotypes within a cattery cluster around one strain (2, 15, 25) , we tested pooled serum samples of randomly selected Swiss catteries for their predominant serotype. In none of the catteries antibody titers to type 2 were predominant. Along with the low seroprevalence of type 2 in individual cats, these data support the hypothesis that the type typically known as type 2 does not occur very frequently in the field. In spite of this, type 2 viruses are most frequently used in laboratories. This may not reflect their importance in the field but rather their ease of cultivation in vitro.",

Similarly, in Japan, 80.4% and 10.1% of chronically diseased cats tested positive for FCoV type 1 and type 2, respectively (19) . Thus, FCoV type 1 viruses may be more likely to replicate to high viral load, induce higher antibody titers, and thereby may become more frequently associated with chronic disease and/or FIP. Again, this can be explained by the better adaptation of type 1 to cats. In our study, 100% of confirmed FIP cases were seropositive to FCoV. This high seroprevalence in FIP cases was significantly higher than that of the healthy cat population and corresponds well with 87% and 96% found in other studies (5, 31) . All of our FIP samples tested positive for type 1 or both types similarly. We could not find a single FIP case testing higher for type 2. Thus, the above mentioned hypothesis of FCoV type 1 being of higher pathogenicity than type 2 appears to be true also for FIP development.",

The statistically significant correlation of antibody titers to FCoV 1/FCoV 2, FCoV 1/TGEV, and FCoV 2/TGEV suggest close immunological relationship. From Fig. 5 , it becomes evident that TGEV as the IFA substrate allowed the detection of 88 cats to be seropositive which would not have been detected using FCoV 1 or FCoV 2 antigens. The low titers of these samples (73% with titers of 25 and 27% with titers of 100) suggest that TGEV may be a better substrate, i.e., produces higher concentrations of viral antigens in its pig cell line than FCoV 1 and 2 grown in cat cells. Alternatively, the antibodies present in these 88 samples could have been induced by a third type of FCoV currently not known which is more closely related to TGEV than FCoV. For the diagnosis of clinical FIP (36) , TGEV is equally suited as FCoV. Therefore, for FIP diagnosis, either FCoV or TGEV can be used. It is emphasized, however, that coronavirus titers alone must not be used as single parameter for FIP diagnosis (22) . However, if seropositivity is to be detected, TGEV in pig cells appears to be better suited.",
