The mortality rates associated with RSV infection in CHD have been reported significantly higher than in infants without underlying diseases. [7] [8] [9] For the past 10 years, the humanized monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, has been used as prophylaxis for serious RSV infection in high risk infants, and has resulted in a significant reduction in hospitalization rates for children <24 months of age suffering from HS-CHD. 10) Reflecting the global trend, Korean guidelines by the by Korean National Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, have approved the use of palivizumab in children <1 year of age with HS-CHD since 2009 (Table 1 ). These criteria, as suggested by Feltes et al., 7) 11) have been applied in the recommendation of indicated RSV prophylaxis in many countries, but only up to 2 years of age. This is the first study to evaluate the compliance with the Korean guideline on prophylactic treatment for RSV in pediatric CHD patients. We retrospectively analyzed current data on RSV prophylaxis to determine the prevalence of morbidity in children with CHD in Korea, who developed RSV infection despite receiving prophylaxis as per the Korean guidelines.",

            "text": "The effectiveness of prophylactic palivizumab for prevention of RSV infection in CHD patients was shown by a randomized controlled study in 1998. 7) Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against RSV, has been the gold standard for RSV prophylaxis in high risk groups, and recently was shown by a Cochrane metaanalysis to have significantly reduced the hospitalization rate of infected patients. 10) The study showed a 45% relative reduction in RSV hospitalization among high risk children receiving palivizumab (9.7% vs. 5.3%; p=0.003). before the palivizumab era, about more than 10% of all CHD infants required hospital admission for RSV infection and some needed intensive care; however, palivizumab vaccination at the start of RSV season has been proven to reduce the rate of hospitalizations by half (~5%). 7)12) 13) In Korea, according to the biweekly reports from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the seasonal outbreaks of RSV infection occur during the winter months, namely September through March. Almost all children are susceptible to RSV infection until they reach the age of 2 years, and on an average, nearly half will experience two episodes of infection. 2)9) Prior to the palivizumab era (from 2003 to 2006), in a study of 213 patients diagnosed with lower respiratory infection, 45 CHD patients (21.1%) were hospitalized due to RSV infection, 22 (48.9%) were treated in the ICU, 12 (26.7%) required mechanical ventilation, and 2 (4.4%) died; however, no deaths occurred among non-CHD patients. 14) In our study, the rate of mortality related to RSV infection (1.1%) was reduced significantly but was still a threat to infants with HS-CHD even after palivizumab injection, because the monoclonal antibody tends to attenuate but not eradicate RSV disease. 5)9) [15] [16] [17] Moreover, the rate of RSV-associated hospitalization of children <12 months old with HS-CHD who received more than one prophylactic injection was 12.5%, which was relatively higher than in previous reports from other countries (0.46% to 5.3%). 18) One- fourth of the patients were admitted to the ICU with RSV infection, and 3 patients were hospitalized for longer than 4 weeks. This could relate to incomplete vaccination, which would point to a lack of compliance with the guideline, as well as increased testing for RSV. 5)7)11) [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Many cases started prophylaxis either earlier (n=70, 15%) or later (n=182, 39%) than the recommendation, and it can be argued that delays in identifying patients at risk could have affected the outcome. 23) Monthly injections of up to five injections are recommended once patients start treatment; however, the majority (69%) of patients in this study received less than four, including 36% who received only one injection. Therefore, factors involved in effective prophylactic treatment include ensuring that treatment is initiated at the right time, and that children with CHD are identified and followed up. Missing or delayed injections may lead to increased rates of re-hospitalization, making it essential to adhere to prophylactic guidelines. 24)25) According to many studies that have reported advantages in socio-economic aspects of prophylaxis of RSV infection in CHD patients under the age of 2 years, recommendations from the guidelines of Canada, Japan, Germany, and Austria for the use of palivizumab have included children younger than 24 months of age. 8) In contrast, the Korean guideline has recommend 12 months as the upper age limit. Our study noted that 3 patients were hospitalized with RSV infection after 1 year of age, who were not treated after the recommended age of 12 months.",

Because the Korean guideline for the use of palivizumab in infants with CHD limits the vaccination to the infants who are receiving medication for congestive heart failure, patients who showed improvement of heart failure after cardiovascular surgery usually had terminated medication, and therefore, were not eligible for additional vaccinations. Moreover, RSV pneumonia is associated with a high risk of postoperative complications. 4)26) 27) In this study, there were 5 deaths related to RSV infection; of these, underlying heart diseases for 3 among the 5 deaths were associated with simple left-right shunt lesion. The American Association of Pediatricians has recommended administration of another injection of palivizumab (15 mg/kg) as soon as possible in postoperative patients because serum palivizumab levels decrease by 58% after cardiopulmonary bypass. 15)16)28) Therefore, it is essential to supplement this guideline, as well as adhere to the existing guideline, ensuring that treatment is started at the right time and that an additional postoperative injection is given immediately. The emphasis should be the identification of children with CHD.",

Stagnant pulmonary flow due to cardiomyopathy results in significantly abnormal hemodynamics with perivascular infiltrates, leading to altered vascular tone and permeability changes in the alveolar-capillary interface, which is further exaggerated by the inflammation caused by RSV. 29) Therefore, the USA, UK, Japan, France, and Austria have adopted the recommendations for infants with cardiomyopathy as co-morbidity. 8) These findings should be taken into consideration when deciding which children should receive prophylaxis.",

Even though the current data on RSV prophylaxis has been collected for infants with CHD in Korea, the data might actually be helpful for CHD patients if the Korean guideline would be extended to children up to 24 months of age with HS-CHD, including cardiomyopathy, and postoperative CHD patients. We recommend that the guideline should be updated based on the key findings: (i) the risk of hospitalization due to RSV infection remains high among children with CHD, (ii) children with CHD exhibit a higher rate of morbidity despite prophylactic treatment than that reported in recent studies, 11) [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and (iii) since the RSV season of Korea is not different with that of other countries, the national guideline might be regarded as outdated by international guidelines. 23) In Korean guidelines, the patient group with HCM was not supported financially. Thus, only a few patients with HCM were included because patients who had received palivizumab injection were rare. This is the first and largest study to evaluate compliance according to the Korean guideline for prophylactic treatment, and to determine that morbidity and mortality due to RSV infection is still significant in children with CHD. According to the Korean guidelines, the risk of RSV infection remains significant among children with hemodynamically insignificant CHD, cardiomyopathy, and children above 1 year-old with HS-CHD.",
