            "text": "Previous studies have shown that host genetic heterogeneity in the response to infectious challenge can affect the emergence risk and the severity of diseases transmitted through direct contact between individuals. However, there is substantial uncertainty about the degree and direction of influence owing to different definitions of genetic variation, most of which are not in line with the current understanding of the genetic architecture of disease traits. Also, the relevance of previous results for diseases transmitted through environmental sources is unclear. In this article a compartmental genetic-epidemiological model was developed to quantify the impact of host genetic diversity on epidemiological characteristics of diseases transmitted through a contaminated environment. The model was parameterized for footrot in sheep. Genetic variation was defined through continuous distributions with varying shape and degree of dispersion for different disease traits. The model predicts a strong impact of genetic heterogeneity on the disease risk and its progression and severity, as well as on observable host phenotypes, when dispersion in key epidemiological parameters is high. The impact of host variation depends on the disease trait for which variation occurs and on environmental conditions affecting pathogen survival. In particular, compared to homogeneous populations with the same average susceptibility, disease risk and severity are substantially higher in populations containing a large proportion of highly susceptible individuals, and the differences are strongest when environmental contamination is low. The implications of our results for the recording and analysis of disease data and for predicting response to selection are discussed.",

Further, as outlined in detail below, a review of these models reveals that the assumptions and methods applied are generally not in line with the current understanding of host genetic variation and may not hold for a number of important diseases. Many epidemiological models describe host heterogeneity in disease-dependent parameters in terms of variation in the basic reproductive number R 0 , which is the average number of infections caused by an infected individual over its lifetime in an otherwise susceptible population (Anderson and May 1991) . However, models differ in their specific definition of heterogeneity and this leads to contradicting conclusions (e.g., Woolhouse et al. 1998; Springbett et al. 2003; Nath et al. 2008) . For example, Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) defined heterogeneity as variation in a continuously distributed \"individual reproductive number \" and predicted that the probability of stochastic disease extinction in heterogeneous populations increases with an increasing degree of heterogeneity. In contrast, Springbett et al. (2003) arrived at opposite predictions by defining heterogeneity as a number of distinct genotypes with different values of R 0 and associating greater heterogeneity with a greater number of genotypes.",

Also, given that different genes are likely to control different components of the host response to infection and that genetic control strategies may target specific loci on the genome (Nath et al. 2008) , it may be important to distinguish between heterogeneity occurring in different host-specific traits (e.g., susceptibility, infectivity, and recovery rate) when assessing their impact on epidemiological characteristics.

However, many important diseases, particularly livestock diseases, are transmitted through environmental contamination rather than through direct contact with infectious or intermittent hosts (e.g., some cases of mastitis in cattle; footrot in sheep; and parasitic gastroenteritis in humans, sheep, and cattle). Results of existing models may not directly apply to these types of diseases, as environmental factors influencing pathogen decay may alter the effect of host genetic heterogeneity on disease establishment and progression. Furthermore, the majority of existing epidemiological studies focus on the risk of epidemic outbreaks. Many livestock diseases are, however, endemic, and control strategies aim at minimizing disease severity rather than at reducing the chance of large-scale epidemic outbreaks. For these cases, characteristics such as disease prevalence and severity and their changes over time are important characteristics that need to be assessed.",

Each individual has its predefined shedding rates k D (i) and k C (i) associated with the diseased and the carrier state, respectively, which are defined as the number of bacteria shed into the environment per unit area per day.

For ease of interpretation, variation between hosts was considered separately for each host-specific epidemiological trait listed in Table 1 (i.e., T S , T L , T D , T C , T R , k C , or k D ). A heritability of 1 was assumed for all traits; i.e., it was assumed that environmental variation is fully represented by the stochastic nature of the model. Values for the host-specific epidemiological trait in question were drawn from a two-parameter continuous gamma distribution with shape parameter a and scale parameter u [i.e., probability density function is x a21 \u00f0exp\u00f02x=u\u00de=G\u00f0a\u00deu a \u00de]. The individual transition rates between successive disease states in the epidemiological model are then the inverse of the corresponding gamma-distributed time periods. Hence, for T X Gamma (a, u), r X \u00bc 1/T X InverseGamma (a, 1/u). Gamma distributions can adopt a variety of shapes, such as concave (a , 1), nearly symmetric (a large), or unimodal and strongly right skewed (a 1). The shape of the probability density function is determined by the shape parameter a, and the coefficients of variation, dispersion, skewness, and kurtosis, are 1= ffiffiffi a p , 1=a, 2= ffiffiffi a p , and 1=a, respectively. Smaller values of a thus indicate greater heterogeneity as well as a greater degree of asymmetry and peakedness. As an example, supershedders in a disease to which the \"20/80 rule\" (20% of the population contributes 80% of the entire transmission potential) applies (Woolhouse et al. 1997; Matthews et al. 2006) can be represented as the top 20% from the right-hand tail of a gamma distribution for k D or k C with shape parameter a \u00bc 0.25. From a genetic point of view, the shape of the gamma distribution reflects the genetic architecture of the trait. For example, an infinitesimal genetic model assuming that the trait in question is affected by a large number of genes each with an infinitesimally small effect, would correspond to a symmetric distribution, whereas the presence of few loci with large effects on the trait of interest and an unbalanced allele frequency at these loci in the population, or dominance, could give rise to a skewed distribution.",

Third, we recorded disease incidence, i.e., the total number of new infections over the simulated time period, as a measure of disease severity. Finally, as the stochastic epidemiological model provides continuous information of the disease state of every individual over time, observable phenotypic infection characteristics, such as the frequency of infections (i.e., number of times that the individual moved from state S to L) and the number of days that an individual was infected (i.e., spent in categories L, D, or C) throughout the simulated 3 years, were calculated for each individual. These characteristics may constitute the estimated or observed phenotypes in genetic analyses of field data and hence form the bases of selection or management strategies. We therefore assessed how population averages and variances of these observable infection characteristics are affected by variations in epidemiological input parameters.

As for variation in susceptibility (T S ), the influence is substantially stronger for low a and becomes negligible for high values of a (Figure 2 , C-F). However, in contrast to what is observed for host variation in susceptibility, variation in host infectivity (T D or k D ) can substantially affect the risk of disease establishment in all environments. For example, for T B \u00bc 12 days, the probability of disease persistence for $3 years decreases from 0.86 for homogeneous populations to 0.46 and 0.45, for variation in T D and k D with a \u00bc 0.25, respectively (Figure 2, C and E). For T B \u00bc 1.5 days, the risk of footrot persistence in populations with the same degree of variation in T D and k D , respectively, decreases from 0.31 to 0.08 (Figure 2 , D and F) and becomes virtually zero for T B \u00bc 1 day (i.e., disease persisted in ,5 of 10,000 replicates; results not shown). There is little difference between the probabilities of disease establishment associated with host variation in T D or k D (Figure 2 , C-F). Variation in other epidemiological parameters (T L , T C , k C , and T R ; Table 1) was, however, found to have little effect on the risk of disease establishment, regardless of the shape of variation and of the simulated environmental conditions. Impact of variation on disease prevalence over time Figure 3 shows the predicted influence of host variation on footrot prevalence over time in populations avoiding stochastic disease extinction. Average prevalence profiles, and the impact of host variation on them, depend strongly on bacterial survival rates. If bacteria survive in the soil for a long time, average footrot prevalence rapidly increases toward its peak within a few weeks after the introduction of the infection into the population, after which it gradually declines toward an endemic equilibrium (Figure 3 , A, C, E, and G). In contrast, when bacteria decay fast, prevalence in populations in which footrot could establish generally increases gradually toward an endemic equilibrium with a lower average proportion of animals infected than for slow bacterial decay ( Figure 3B shows the trend toward the equilibrium).",

In particular, when bacteria decay fast (T B low), a large proportion of highly susceptible individuals poses the greatest risk for severe outbreaks, whereas when bacterial decay is slow (T B high), a large proportion of individuals not developing immunity causes the most severe outbreaks. For example, for T B \u00bc 1.5 days, the average number of incidences increased from 4387 for homogeneous populations to 13,776 in populations with large variation in T S (a \u00bc 0.25). The same variation in T R produced on average 5361 incidences. In contrast, for T B \u00bc 12 days, the average number of incidences for homogeneous populations and populations with the same large variation in T S were similar (i.e., 16,670 and 17,564, respectively), whereas populations with large variation T R experienced a substantially higher average number of incidences (i.e., 24,465 incidences). Table 2 shows the predicted impact of host heterogeneity, when expressed in different environments, on the frequencies and number of days that animals are infected per year. As would be expected, average number of infected days and frequency of infections were generally higher in environments with high contamination risk (high values of T B ). With some exceptions (outlined below), standard deviations in these characteristics were also higher for higher values of T B , implying that genetic variation is generally more strongly expressed in more infectious environments (Table  2) . Also, as would be expected, individual variation in observable infection characteristics generally increases with increasing degree of heterogeneity in the epidemiological parameters.

Also, heterogeneity in T S mainly affects averages and variances in the observable infection characteristics when environmental contamination is low, whereas heterogeneity in T D and T R shows their impact on infection characteristics in all simulated environments (Table 2) . Variation in other epidemiological parameters, in particular shedding rates (k D and k C ), was found to have no significant effect on average or variation in host infection characteristics (results not shown). The results in Table 2 also illustrate that variation in a particular epidemiological trait may affect various infection characteristics simultaneously. For example, increasing the proportion of individuals with a short expected duration of the diseased period (i.e., decreasing a for T D in Table 2 ) tends to decrease not only the average number of days per year that individuals are infected, but also, given that infection is a stochastic event, the average frequency of infections per year.",

Our model results suggest that the impact of host heterogeneity on relevant epidemiological characteristics is largely controlled by the shape of underlying distributions describing individual variation. Whereas differences between homogeneous and heterogeneous populations in predicted epidemiological characteristics are generally subtle and often negligible when heterogeneity is described by symmetric distributions in underlying epidemiological traits, they can be large when underlying distributions are skewed and leptokurtic and dispersion is high. In particular, by representing host heterogeneity with right-skewed gamma distributions, our model results predict that the influence of a large proportion of individuals with low values in a particular trait (e.g., low resistance, low shedding rate, short duration of diseased period, or short-lived immunity) on the disease epidemiology outweighs the influence of a small proportion of individuals with extremely high values for these traits. Thus, the presence of few high shedders does not necessarily increase disease risk if the majority of individuals have low pathogen shedding rates. Also, our results suggest that understanding the source of genetic variation, i.e., identifying the epidemiological trait(s) for which variation occurs, is important when making predictions for epidemiological outcomes and interpreting epidemiological data. Distributions of the same shape for different epidemiological traits often resulted in different predictions for disease risk and severity. The impact of variation in a particular trait depends strongly on the role of this trait in the progression of the disease in the population. For example, both the duration of the infectious period (T D and T C ) and bacterial shedding rates (k D and k C ) may be considered as measures of host infectivity in field studies. However, whereas shedding rates are incorporated directly into epidemiological models, time periods are usually incorporated through their inverses, as these provide the required transition rates. Hence, even if variation in shedding rates and duration of the infectious period are represented by distributions of similar shape, their impact on the epidemiology can be quite different.",

            "text": "Our study differs from the majority of previous theoretical studies in that it focuses on an infectious disease that is transmitted through an environmental source instead of through direct contact with infectious individuals. This type of disease merits attention as it constitutes a substantial proportion of livestock diseases of major concern for animal and human health. Our results agree with those from studies on directly transmitted diseases in that host genetic heterogeneity can significantly affect the risk of disease emergence (e.g., Hethcote and Van Ark 1987; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005; Yates et al. 2006 ) and persistence (e.g., Doeschl-Wilson et al. 2009 ) and the course of emerging epidemics (e.g., May and Anderson 1988; Springbett et al. 2003; Nath et al. 2008 ). However, our results provide novel evidence that, for a disease transmitted through the environment, the influence of host genetic variation on disease emergence and severity can strongly depend on environmental conditions. These were found to affect more the degree than the direction of influence. For example, heterogeneity in host susceptibility was found to increase disease risk and severity in all modeled environments but its impact was much stronger when The source of host variation is represented by variation in different epidemiological parameters (e.g., T S , T D , and T R ), whereas the shape is represented by different parameter values a of the gamma distribution. The scale parameter u was chosen so that the population mean au is the same as for homogeneous populations. Values and parameters are defined in Table 1 . For other epidemiological parameters (k C , k D , T L , and T C ) for which host variation was assumed (see Table 1 ), the predicted impact of variation on the predicted infection characteristics was found to be negligible. a Averages were taken over all replicates with positive footrot prevalence. environmental contamination was low (Figures 2, A and B, and 3, A and B) . Also, except for populations with large heterogeneity in susceptibility, predicted variances in observable phenotypic infection characteristics were generally lower in these conditions (Table 2) , indicating that genetic variation may not be fully observed in environments with low exposure. These results complement the analytical expressions derived by Bishop and Woolliams (2010) , which predict that incomplete exposure to infection (e.g., due to low disease prevalence in the population) leads to a downward bias in estimates of genetic variation. Previous studies often differ in their predictions for the effect of host variation owing largely to different definitions of host genetic heterogeneity (Springbett et al. 2003; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005; Yates et al. 2006; Nath et al. 2008) . The study closest to ours in terms of definition of host heterogeneity is that of Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) who modeled host variation in infectiousness for diseases transmitted through direct contact also with continuous gamma distributions. They established that the probability of extinction increases with increasing dispersion and skewness due to the high proportion of individuals contributing very little to the spread of the disease at the early stages. Our model predicts the same trend for diseases transmitted through environmental sources. However, the models of Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) also predict for populations avoiding extinction more severe outbreaks as dispersion and skewness increase. In contrast, our model predicts that variation in infectiousness, when represented by the duration of the infectious period or by different shedding rates, tends to decrease disease prevalence at all times. The discrepancy could be attributed to the different modes of disease transmission considered in both models. Compared to directly transmitted diseases, the influence of few highly infectious individuals on the spread of disease is diffused when transmission occurs through an environmental source, whose contamination level is the cumulative contribution of all infectious individuals.",

            "text": "Several studies on directly transmitted diseases have shown that the impact of genetic variation on the risk of disease emergence depends on to the source of genetic heterogeneity. For example, assuming a finite locus model for genetic variation, with one locus controlling the transmission coefficient (representing host susceptibility to infection) and another locus controlling the recovery rate, Nath et al. (2008) found that genetic variation in the transmission coefficient resulted in higher probabilities of disease emergence, whereas variation in the recovery rate had no such impact. Defining host variation also by few (i.e., two) distinct homogeneous subgroups, Yates et al. (2006) have further shown that variation in host infectivity can greatly reduce the probability of disease emergence. Our model predicts similar trends if host susceptibility, recovery, or infectivity are controlled by multiple loci. However, in contrast to the results of Nath et al. (2008) and our results, Yates et al. (2006) predict that variation in susceptibility will not increase the risk of disease establishment, in particular when bacterial decay is fast. A likely cause for this discrepancy is that Yates et al. (2006) simulated heterogeneous populations by assigning 100 times higher susceptibility to 10% of the individuals than to the rest of the population, thus approximating a negatively skewed distribution in susceptibility rather than the positively skewed distributions considered here. Combining the results of both studies would thus suggest that compared to homogeneous populations with the same average susceptibility, heterogeneous populations with a large proportion of highly susceptible individuals have a higher risk of disease emergence, but the emergence risk will not decrease if the majority of individuals are resistant.",

The latter has long been considered a viable alternative to conventional disease control, but its benefits in terms of reducing disease risk and severity are poorly understood. Our results suggest that accurate predictions of selection response for disease risk and severity require a thorough understanding of the structure of genetic variation, i.e., of the source of genetic variation and the shape of the corresponding distributions. Genetic control strategies in livestock currently focus on exploiting genetic variation in disease resistance as a whole to reduce disease risk and severity. Our results, however, indicate that variation in different epidemiological traits, such as infectiousness or duration of immunity, can influence very differently both disease risk and severity. The question therefore arises whether genetic variation in these alternative traits can be identified using currently available disease data and statistical methods. For example, a recent simulation study (Lipschutz-Powell et al. 2010 ) demonstrated that classic quantitative genetics models applied to binary incidence data cannot identify genetic variation in infectivity, as an individual's infectivity is expressed in its group members rather than in the individual itself. Further efforts in more detailed recording of disease data and in the development of adequate genetic models would be required, before this important source of genetic variation can be exploited.",

Genetic analyses of disease data often assume an underlying normally distributed individual liability for disease prevalence (Robertson and Lerner 1949; Falconer and Mackay 1996) . Although this assumption may hold for diseases for which many genes have small additive effects on epidemiological parameters, skewed leptokurtic distributions may be more appropriate for diseases where a number of genes have large effects and allele frequencies are unbalanced or in cases where the relationship between genetic effects and the epidemiological traits in consideration is not linear. Our results suggest that greater attention should be given to the assumptions concerning liability distributions in genetic analyses of disease data, as disease risk and prevalence depend strongly on the shape of the distributions. Wrong assumptions could not only lead to biased estimates of genetic parameters, but also produce wrong predictions for the selection response. Recent advances in genomic studies could provide the opportunity to accurately describe the genetic architecture that defines the shape of the distribution in epidemiological traits of interest.",

            "text": "Our model results further emphasize that the consequences of genetic selection on both the population mean and the variation should be taken into consideration when predicting disease risk and prevalence in future generations. For example, selecting against high susceptibility would not only increase the average disease resistance in future generations, but also decrease the proportion of highly susceptible individuals in the frequency distribution for susceptibility. On the basis of our predictions, the associated changes in the shape of the distribution would decrease the future risk of disease establishment and disease severity much more than would be anticipated from classical quantitative genetics theory alone, which does not account for changes in the distributions' shapes. Finally, the results of our study elucidate that the choice of the most appropriate selection strategy would depend on the parent and offspring environment. For example, whereas our results suggest that selection against high susceptibility would be the most efficient means to reduce disease risk and prevalence in environments with low contamination risk, selection for fast recovery would be advantageous if the contamination risk is high. Given thus the results from this study, among the next steps to be taken in the genetic control of infectious disease are a more accurate description of genetic heterogeneity among individuals and the development of statistical methods to account for different types and shapes of genetic variation in the analysis of disease data and in genetic-epidemiological models.",
