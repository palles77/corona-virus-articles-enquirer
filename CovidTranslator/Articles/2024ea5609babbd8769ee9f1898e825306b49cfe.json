IgY technology has been identified as a promising alternative to generating a mass amount of specific antibody for use in immunotherapy and immunodiagnostics. The purpose of this study was to produce specific antibody by egg yolk antibody (IgY) to recombinant FanC protein from ETEC. Materials and Methods: FanC (K99) gene was amplified from ETEC by specific primers and polymerase chain reaction. The gene was cloned and subcloned into pTZ57R/T and pET32a (+) vectors, respectively. Recombinant vector was transferred into E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3). Protein expression was investigated by 1 mM IPTG induction. Hens were immunized by the purified recombinant FanC protein. The activity and specificity of the IgY antibody were detected by dot-blotting, Western blotting, and indirect ELISA. Results: We obtained FanC specific IgYs by immunizing the hens with the recombinant FanC protein. The anti-FanC IgY showed binding specifically to the FanC protein of ETEC.",

Anti-FanC IgY antibody was produced by immunizing hens with the recombinant FanC protein, which can be used as a tool for the immune diagnosis. The results of this study are in agreement with the results of other studies that indicated immunized hens are an excellent alternative for production of polyclonal antibodies (24, 25) .

The antigen FanC amount showed that it simulated the immunological response. It was reported the ideal does for simulating immune system ranges from 10 \u03bcg to 1 mg (27) . In this study, FanC antigen concentration was within this ideal range. The antibody activity started to increase two weeks after intramuscular injection (P-value<0.05).

Therefore, the anti-FanC IgY could be developed for diagnosis and treatment of ETEC infection. A further experiment with different titers of IgY and its preventive effects on the bacteria may give more practical information for an alternative application of IgY in the future as a supplement to passive immunity in newborn calves, sheep, and pigs against an economically important bacterial disease.",
