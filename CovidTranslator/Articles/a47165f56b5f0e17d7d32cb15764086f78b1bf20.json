We conducted site-directed mutagenesis to the 3 UTR of the type II porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Serial deletions of the 3 UTR showed that at least 40 nucleotides immediately following the ORF7 stop codon were dispensable for the viability of PRRSV in cultured cells. We then constructed a chimeric PRRSV cDNA clone using type II PRRSV as the backbone containing the 3 UTR from the type I PRRSV. The chimeric virus was viable and shared similar properties with the parental virus. Our results provided the first description of the 40nt dispensable region in type I PRRSV 3 UTR, and further predicted structure demonstrated that the high-order structure of 3 UTR might play significant roles in its function.",

The coordination among different stages of virus infection has been the focus for RNA virology. It is believed that un-translated region (UTR) of the RNA genome plays a central role in balancing these processes, via different sequence motifs, alternative high-order structures, and interacting with other viral or host factors (Chang and Luo, 2006; Garneau et al., 2008; Liu and Leibowitz, 2010; Uzri and Gehrke, 2009; Zust et al., 2008) . For instance, complete 3 UTR deletion of poliovirus genome has deleterious effect on virus replication (Rohll et al., 1995; Todd et al., 1997) . In addition, it has been reported that positive-strand RNA virus 3 UTR can control viral gene translation as an independent enhancer or indirect interaction with the internal ribosome entry site of the 5 UTR (Koh et al., 2002; Lopez de Quinto et al., 2002) . The 3 UTR structure of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) genome remains largely unknown.",

It was reported that the primary sequence of an essential region, a bulged stem-loop, and a pseudoknot structure of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) 3 UTR are crucial for the virus viability, and such multiple, sometimes mutually exclusive elements may serve as a molecular switch to balance the different stages of virus replication (Goebel et al., 2004a; Goebel et al., 2004b; Hsue and Masters, 1997; Liu and Leibowitz, 2010; Williams et al., 1999) .",

PRRSV genome is about 15 kb in length, containing at least nine open reading frames (ORF) flanked by 5 -and 3 -UTR. Based on the overall genetic relationship, PRRSV is further classified as two genotypes, European (type I) and North American (type II), between which 60% genetic identity of the overall genomic sequences exists (Mateu and Diaz, 2008) . PRRSV is known for its genetic heterogeneity, up to 21% intra-genotypic diversity for type II PRRSV has been reported (Key et al., 2001; Mateu and Diaz, 2008; Meng, 2000) . Interestingly, these two distinct PRRSV genotypes were identified almost simultaneously as the causative agents of blue-ear disease in two different continents (Collins et al., 1992; Plagemann, 2003; Wensvoort et al., 1991) , which demonstrat that these two genotype virus share the same key functional component in virus replication or transcription process.",

            "text": "Similar to the coronavirus, arterivirus RNA synthesis is initiated at the genomic 3 end, where the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) binds and initiates the synthesis of the negative strand genome-length RNA and a set of subgenomic RNAs, formed by a unique discontinuous transcription mechanism Meng et al., 1996; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . These negative-sense RNAs then serve as templates for the synthesis of progeny viral RNA genome and a series of 5 and 3 co-terminal subgenomic RNAs (Pasternak et al., 2006) . The UTR sequence and structural elements are believed to play a vital regulatory role in these RNA synthesis processes. It was reported that the Lelystad virus (LV), the prototypic type I PRRSV can tolerate 7 nt deletion, but 30 nt deletion in the 114 nt length of LV 3 UTR abolished RNA replication (Verheije et al., 2001; Verheije et al., 2002) . With a shorter 3 UTR of 59 nt, the EAV 3 genomic terminus forms up to five stem-loop (SL) structures, with the SL5 located in 3 UTR forming a pseudoknot with the SL4 coding for nucleocapsid (N) protein . Interestingly, part of the SL4 analogue, located in PRRSV LV 3 UTR, is also engaged in a kissing-loop interaction with a 7 nt sequence coding for the LV N protein Verheije et al., 2001; Verheije et al., 2002) . These results demonstrated that arterivirus replication is also regulated by structural elements residing in the 3 end of the genomic RNA. Previous studies find that the 911 nucleotides from the 3 end of the viral genome contains the minimal cis-acting element required for type II PRRS viral replication (Choi et al., 2006) . Beyond that, little is known about regulatory elements for PRRSV type II, which has the longest 3 UTR (151 nt) among the arteriviruses. In particular, it remains unresolved that if the 3 UTR of the two genotypes of PRRSV play a similar role in PRRSV replication process, despite of the distinct relationship in primary sequence and the length.",

To do so, we compared the 3 UTR nucleotide sequences of five representative strains of each type I and type II PRRSV. The genotype I strains include LV (GenBank Accession No. M96262), SD01-08 (DQ489311), EuroPRRS (AY366525), and LV421 (AY588319), and five type II strains including VR2332 (AY150564), JX143 (EF488048), p129 (AF494042), CH1a (AY032626) and APRRS (GQ330474). As shown in Fig. 1 , the type I PRRSV 3 UTR is 37 nt shorter than that of type II, which located at immediately downstream of the ORF7 stop codon. However, the 3 UTR sequences are extremely intra-genotypically conserved. In addition, the pairwise genetic identity between the two genotypes is 63%, and yet inter-typically conserved domains, shaded in black, do exist. We arbitrarily designated these inter-typically conserved domains as CS1 (conserved sequence), CS2, a possible long bulged stem-loop region LSL, and VR represents variable region. The main goal of this study is to investigate the possible effect of these 3 UTR sequence on PRRSV virus replication. To facilitate reverse genetic manipulation, we inserted a stretch of sequence consisting of Pac I and Asc I recognition sites. Next, utilizing the Asc I site, we deleted the extra 40 nt region of type II PRRSV 3 UTR, compared with that of type I, and the resultant full-length plasmid was designated as pURAD40 (Fig. 2) . Utilizing SOE-PCR, we then took out the Pac I and Asc I site in order to eliminate the possible adverse effect of the Pac I and Asc I recognition sequence. Finally, based on pURD40, we replaced the entire 3 UTR sequence with that of type I, such that the pSURLV is the full-length cDNA clone in the backbone of type II PRRSV containing the type I 3 UTR. All full-length cDNA clones were verified by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing.",

It is not unexpected that the extra 40 nt stretch is dispensable for the viability of type II PRRSV, which has the longest 3 UTR among the arteriviruses. In this study, we demonstrated that all virological properties including plaque morphology, size and viral growth kinetics, as well as the sgmRNA profiles remain unchanged in vURAD40, indicating that this 40 nt stretch located at the 5 proximal end of the 3 UTR of the type II PRRSV is indeed nonessential for virus replication in cultured MARC-145 cells. We are attempting to delimit the minimal 3 UTR cis-acting signals for virus replication, and RNA synthesis processes including these of the minus-strand, genomic and sgmRNAs. The delimitation of maximal nonessential 3 UTR sequence is under way. The 3 UTR can influence virus life cycle through different regions, it includes both variable region and conserved region which may affect virus characterization in different aspects. Several studies demonstrated that a hypervariable region (HVR) and some RNA stem-loops of the genomic RNA of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) are nonessential for the virus replication in tissue culture, and yet the 3 UTR HVR played a significant role in viral pathogenesis in vivo (Goebel et al., 2007) . Similar observations have been made on flaviviruses including the Dengue virus and bovine viral diarrhea disease virus (BVDV), based on which one can rationally design an attenuated vaccine by deleting the 3 UTR motif that is nonessential for in vitro culture but critical for in vivo virulence (Hanley et al., 2004; Pankraz et al., 2005) . Whether the 40 nt deletion described here has impli-cation on PRRSV in vivo pathogenicity warrants further animal trial.",

A similar pseudoknot interaction between the main 3 UTR loop and the upstream coding sequence for nucleocapsid of EAV was proved to be critical for virus replication (Beerens and Snijder, 2006) . Intriguingly, the pseudoknot interacting upstream loop (SL4 counterpart, shaded in Fig. 7C , shaded and circled in Fig. 8B ) was found to form another kissing-loop interaction with a 7 nt sequence coding for the N-terminal of the nucleocapsid protein of the type I PRRSV (Verheije et al., 2002) . In this study, the predicted structure showed that the long bulged stem-loop could be a critical regulating element for porcine arterivirus replication. Surprisingly, the pseudoknot interacting arms found in EAV formed virtually perfect long Fig. 8 . Porcine arterivirus contains an inter-typically conserved long bulged stem-loop in 3 UTR.
