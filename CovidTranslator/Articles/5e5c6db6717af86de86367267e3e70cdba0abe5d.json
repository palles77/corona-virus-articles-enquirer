While much of the focus is on respiratory infections, there is substantial evidence that certain pathogens, such as those which colonise the skin, can be released into, and transported through the air through routine activities. In these situations the bacteria is released over a volume of space, with different intensities and locations varying in time rather than being released at a single point.",

An experimental validation study provides a direct comparison between CFD simulations and bioaerosol distribution, showing that passive scalar and particle tracking approaches are both appropriate for small particle bioaerosols. The study introduces a zonal source, which aims to represent the time averaged release of bacteria from an activity within a zone around the entire location the release takes place. This approach is shown to perform well when validated numerically though comparison with the time averaged dispersion patterns from a transient source. However, the ability of a point source to represent such dispersion is dependent on airflow regime. The applicability of the model is demonstrated using a simulation of an isolation room representing the release of bacteria from bedmaking.",

            "text": "Transmission of infection by airborne routes is widely recognised as a key factor in the spread of many diseases including Tuberculosis, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Influenza, and control strategies involving ventilation design and face masks for patients and staff are widely advocated [1] . However, despite a growing body of evidence that aerial transmission may be important, there is little research on strategies to control airborne transport and environmental contamination arising from pathogens that colonise the skin, such as Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Although MRSA is primarily transferred via contact spread it may also colonise the nasal passages as a result of airborne contamination [2] , spreading to the skin and potentially resulting in further transfer to wounds or ingestion [3] . Since MRSA has the ability to survive for several months on hospital surfaces [4, 5] any airborne particles depositing on surfaces have the potential to create long term reservoirs of infectious material that can be transferred by touch to new patients. Boswell and Fox [6] showed surface contamination reduced when portable air cleaning devices were deployed, clearly indicating that airborne transport plays a role in the dispersion of MRSA in the environment. The release of particles contaminated with MRSA into the air may occur from the skin which is shed during routine activities such as walking [7, 8] , bedmaking [9e11] and undressing and washing [7, 12, 13] . In such cases dispersion does not occur from a single point in space, as a respiratory release. Instead the dispersal of bacteria will vary in spatial location and intensity depending on the activity. Understanding this release, and the likely environmental contamination that results, is key to developing appropriate interventions for reducing the aerial transmission of such pathogens.",

Experimental validation of modelling techniques for bioaerosol transport: bioaerosol experiments are conducted in a climatically controlled chamber in order to validate the transport simulations within the CFD model using both passive scalar and Lagrangian particle tracking for comparison. Two different bioaerosol sources are used, a single point source and a linear source which releases bioaerosols across its length. 2. Numerical validation of a zonal source concept: The concept of the zonal source is to represent the complex releases of bioaerosols that vary through time and space in a real hospital environment with an appropriate zone that encompasses the spatial volume of the release. The source is then effectively a time averaged representation of a random source that moves within the zone. The methodology is numerically validated by comparing the dispersion patterns from a steady state release of bioaerosols over a zonal source with the dispersion from a source that traverses the space with time. 3 . Sensitivity analysis in a realistic application: The geometry of the zonal source is designed to encompass the region the bioaerosol release takes place. For certain activities the exact dimensions of the zonal source will be difficult to define. Therefore the sensitivity of the zonal source to the definition of size and shape was studied based on the simulation of an isolation room. This was also compared to the sensitivity of the point source release to the injection location to draw conclusions about the appropriateness of both source representations in modelling pathogen dispersion",

            "text": "Pathogen transport is typically approached in one of two ways. A passive scalar model treats airborne pathogens as a concentration that is transported with the air. Particle properties are approximated through a diffusion coefficient, but the actual particle dynamics are not incorporated. As such the model tends to be used for demonstrating ventilation efficacy [23] and in the context of pathogens is regarded as acceptable for simulating respiratory diseases where the particle size is below 2 mm [14, 15] . The airborne pathogen concentration can easily be presented and is ideal for showing steady state behaviour where there is a continuous source. Alternatively the movement of individual particles can be tracked using a Lagrangian particle tracking model. This considers the forces on particles due to their mass and momentum, producing path lines that are dependent on particle size and density as well as the local airflow. In theory the technique can be applied to any particle size and can also be used to evaluate deposition patterns. The main limitation of the approach is that tracking is time dependant and it is therefore difficult to determine steady state airborne contaminant distributions.",

Particle mass concentration is well represented provided a large enough number of particles are injected in the model [27, 28] , while good correlation with particle distribution has been demonstrated up to 10 mm [29, 30] except in areas of high gradients such as close to the source or at air inlets.

In both simulations and experiments there is a tendency for the contaminant to be entrained into the inlet air stream at higher air change rates (Fig. 7) .

These releases of bacteria occur across large spatial areas and are subject to a significant amount of variation. A single transient simulation of such a release would only represent one possible scenario, whereas in reality there are infinite variations in the transient release due to the nature of the human behaviour. Therefore it is useful to be able to represent the average dispersion pattern of such releases and the above study has demonstrated how this type of dispersal may be approximated in a steady state CFD model The results presented suggest that a zonal source is likely to yield more realistic results than a point source for such releases, however it should be acknowledged that the findings are not based on an exhaustive study and the zonal source should be used with care.

However despite this the simulations gave a reasonable representation of the results. The contour plots (Fig. 7) show clearly the similarities between the model and the experimental results and in particular the tendency for the bioaerosols to be entrained towards the inlet air stream in both cases. The CFD simulation shows a 'safe' zone down the side of the room, with a much lower level of contamination than is shown in the experimental results. This is mainly due to the lower resolution in the experimental data where concentrations were not measured close to the wall. Although the k-3 turbulence model is well validated for use to simulate bulk air flow, this is not the case for particle tracking simulation, and particularly deposition. In fact the assumption of isotropic turbulence has been found to overestimate the deposition of small particles <1 mm in diameter [32] , with results becoming more realistic as inertial forces dominate with large particles. There is a lack of literature presenting experimental data on the deposition of bioaerosols however there have been some attempts to validate the deposition of particles. Leduc and Fredriksson [43] replicated the deposition within a particle sampler and found the RNG turbulence model gave improved results for the deposition of particles <1 mm. However in this study of a full scale room no significant difference was found for the deposition with the two different turbulence models for particles this size. Rui et al. [35] attempted to correlate the simulated deposition of bioaerosols to the transport of bacteria that occurred during a knee surgery. However the level of movement present in the real situation is attributed to lack of correlation between the two scenarios.",

The study considered the overall deposition of a range of particles with a mass median diameter of 2.5 mm and found the results to be comparable between the simulation and experiments, but only when the DRW model was incorporated into the particle tracking model. Since the aim of the zonal source is to simulate average behaviour of a bioaerosol source it may be expected that using simply the effect of the bulk airflow on the particle would provide adequate results. However, without incorporating the DRW model the deposition was significantly underestimated. These results are promising, indicating that simple passive scalar and particle tracking approaches within steady state CFD models may be used to understand the behaviour of bioaerosols. However to understand the effect of turbulence on smaller particles further work is required. The validation also does not consider the pattern of deposition across the space which is important to understand where pathogenic particles may land and cause reservoirs of infection within a ward.

The zonal source is an attempt to respond to this situation by providing a way of representing an important source of bacteria in a hospital in a manner which represents the inherent assumptions required when simulating such a scenario. It is clear from the numerical simulation described above that the average behaviour of the steady state zonal source correlates very well to the average behaviour of a transient source. Therefore this simple representation of the dispersal could provide valuable results to improve understanding of bioaerosol transport within hospitals. As well as taking significantly less time and effort to generate the simulation, the simple results from a steady state simulation convey the average behaviour of the scenario rather than presenting misleadingly complex results from a transient model of an uncertain situation. Although the point source showed a reasonable representation of the moving source in one of the air flow regimes the results exhibited more case dependence than the zonal source. Since it is not possible to know whether it would be representative without carrying out transient simulations for comparison it should be assumed that the point source will not be suitable for simulating the release of bacteria during activity that has a significant spatial component, as in certain air flow regimes it can give highly erroneous results. However, despite the clear improvement in correlation to the time averaged dispersal with the zonal source this validation only represents an initial test with a continuous release from a single point source traversing the space with a constant speed. The zonal source has not been compared to a point source with different velocities, directional changes, or one whose injection concentration varies in time. Equally, although the point source shows much greater case dependency this is based on only two airflow regimes.

For instance every time a bed is made the movements will vary to some extent. Therefore an exact zone can never be defined, and it is important to understand the implications that the assumption of zone size and shape will make. Considering Figs. 13 and 15, the zonal source gives reasonably similar results for changes in volume over the top of the bed. However when the source is very thin there are very high concentration values near the bed and with the particle tracking model there is much greater deposition onto the bed. Since the turbulence model is known to overestimate the velocities perpendicular to the wall [32] it is not surprising that when all the particles are injected 2 or less cells away the rates of deposition are high. Care should therefore be taken to ensure the zonal source is thicker than the width of two cells.",

            "text": "The zonal source in the sensitivity study only considered activities occurring over the bed such as bedmaking which has long been recognised as dispersing large amounts of bacteria into the air [10] . Through observations on a four bed hospital bay the authors found that the highest levels of airborne bioaerosols corresponded to dealing physically with the patients which occurred behind curtains and either on, or next to the bed [45] . By using the zonal source in such situations it is possible to improve understanding of the risk of infectious particles travelling to other patients' areas and being deposited on other beds or side tables where they may be responsible for indirect contact transmission. This study has only assessed the sensitivity of such a source for bedmaking, and hence use for other activities should be carried out with due consideration for the realism of the geometry and the sensitivity of the solution to variation in geometry. This paper has discussed the dispersion of bacteria during nursing activities, however these activities also affect the air flow in the space promoting mixing and the movement of infectious material between areas particularly in situations with low mixing [46] such as local exhaust or displacement ventilation where the directionality, or thermal stratification is the design intent [47, 48] . There are attempts to incorporate human movement into airflow models e.g [37] . However despite being more accurate and detailed for the single motion that is being simulated these will not provide a good understanding of how an isolation room performs in practice when the nurse will move in many different ways. Brohus et al. [49] recognised this and attempted to replicate both the average and worse case scenario of HCWs movement within a steady state model of an operating theatre. He created zones with sources of momentum for the person moving through the space. Following this initial validation of time averaging to represent the dispersal of bacteria due to movement it would be beneficial to link this with the ideas laid out in Brohus et al. [49] to incorporate both the effects on bacterial dispersal and the resulting changes to the air flow from the nursing activities within a ward.",
