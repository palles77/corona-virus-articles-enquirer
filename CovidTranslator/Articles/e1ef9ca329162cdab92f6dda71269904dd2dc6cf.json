We estimated the point prevalence of Pneumocystis pneumonia in non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients according to the number of R-CHOP cycles and investigated whether cytoreduction by chemotherapy is associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia development. We retrospectively established a cohort of patients who received R-CHOP for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in our institution. Using this cohort, we estimated the incidence rate and point prevalence of definite and probable Pneumocystis pneumonia. To assess factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia development several clinical variables, including absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte count at the time of non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis and when the last R-CHOP cycle was administered, were compared between patients with and without Pneumocystis pneumonia. Of 713 patients in the cohort, 14 and 18 patients were diagnosed with definite and probable Pneumocystis pneumonia, respectively. The overall incidence of definite and definite plus probable PCP in NHL patients receiving R-CHOP were 2.0 % (14/713; 95 % CI, 1.1-3.3 %) and 4.5 % (32/713; 95 % CI, 3.2-6.4 %), respectively. This corresponded to 3.8 (95 % CI, 2.2-6.4) and 8.4 (95 % CI, 5.9-11.9) per 1000 persons. Many cases of Pneumocystis pneumonia (22/32, 68.7 %) developed after administration of the fourth R-CHOP cycle. However, there was no statistical difference in Pneumocystis pneumonia prevalence between patients receiving four or more cycles of R-CHOP and fewer than. Higher absolute neutrophil count (4,742/mm 3 vs. 2,627/ mm 3 ; p<0.01) was associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia development at the last R-CHOP cycle, while absolute lymphocyte count at the time of NHL diagnosis was not. Contrary to expectations, Pneumocystis pneumonia is not a frequent complication of R-CHOP treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cytoreduction of R-CHOP might not be a risk factor of Pneumocystis pneumonia development. Universal prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia during R-CHOP treatment could not be strongly recommended.",

As you see, two kinds of regimens which could increase the risk of PCP development are included: rituximab and prednisolone. In addition, this risk could be more increased by the administration of several cycles of R-CHOP regimens, because cytoreduction might progress and the duration of corticosteroid usage will be lengthened in consequence of repeated chemotherapy. Indeed, a previous report showed that antilymphocyte count (ALC) decreased according to the number of cycles of R-CHOP therapy [9, 10] . Based on these rationales, it can be readily inferred that PCP might develop often in patients with NHL who are treated with R-CHOP and incidence of PCP could increase according to repeated cycles of R-CHOP.",

The overall incidence rate of definite PCP in our study cohort was 2.0 % (14/713), which seems to be lower than that of previous studies (6.6-13 %) [9, 16, 17] . This difference might arise from the difference in the interval between R-CHOP cycles. In previous studies the interval between R-CHOP cycles was 14 days, whereas the patients in our study received a R-CHOP regimen with an interval of more than 21 days between the cycles. In fact, a study with a similar result to ours reported a PCP incidence rate of 2.6 % (1/47) in patients receiving R-CHOP with a cycle interval of 21 days [9] .

Furthermore, although the ALC at the time of the last R-CHOP chemotherapy was lower than that at the time of NHL diagnosis, the extent of decrease was not statistically different between patients with and without PCP. In HIV infected patients, it has been the total CD4 number that has been associated with PCP development [21] . Using ALC as a surrogate indicator of the CD4 count may not be appropriate in this setting, particularly because CD8 cell count is known to recover faster than CD4 count [22] . Thus, the lack of association with the ALC could be explained and ALC might not be a reliable tool for prediction of PCP development.",

There has not been such a study showing this kind of association. Higher ANC might come from preceding inflammatory change before clinical manifestation of PCP appeared. In addition, some of probable PCP might be drug-induced interstitial pneumonitis that could make ANC being higher. This finding suggests that cytoreduction by R-CHOP might not be a risk factor of PCP development. This statement is not confirmative, however, because the cases of probable PCP were included in the analysis It is currently unclear whether anti-pneumocystis prophylaxis is necessary for patients receiving R-CHOP. Based on following reasons, anti-pneumocystis prophylaxis in these patients could be suggested: (1) R-CHOP might increase the risk of PCP development, (2) It might be helpful to differentiate PCP with drug-induced lung interstitial diseases, since breakthrough development of PCP seems unlikely to happen frequently [23] . In other words, we might say that diagnosis of drug-induced lung interstitial diseases seems to be favored when patients who received anti-pneumocystis prophylaxis suffered from interstitial pneumonitis.",

Although almost all patients in our cohort did not receive anti-pneumocystis prophylaxis, the rate of PCP development was low. Some experts assert that anti-pneumocystis prophylaxis is necessary only for situations where the incidence rate of PCP is greater than 3-5 % [24] . Second, in our study the development of definite PCP was not associated with a bad prognosis; in fact, only one patient died as a result of definite PCP. This suggests that it is not too late to start anti-pneumocystis therapy after the symptoms of PCP manifest, as long as the patients are cautiously observed. Lastly, one of the important side effects of TMP/ SMX used for anti-pneumocystis prophylaxis is bone marrow suppression [25] . This crucial side effect can disturb the normal course of NHL therapy. Hence, a study estimating the costeffectiveness of anti-pneumocystis prophylaxis in patients receiving R-CHOP used for NHL should be performed.",

First, it is possible that the incidence rate of PCP might be underestimated, because our study was retrospective and clinicians sometimes empirically administered anti-pneumocystis regimens without diagnostic tests to patients who were suspected of having PCP. Additionally, sensitive methods such as PCP and beta-Dglucan were not used for diagnosis of PCP. To avoid an error of lower estimation of PCP incidence, we added the analysis of probable PCP and the overall incidence of definite or probable PCP was less than 5 % of patients receiving R-CHOP regimens. Hence, our statement seems to be still considerable. In our study, however, almost all patients receive R-CHOP every three weeks. Therefore, our statement would not be applicable in the center where R-CHOP is administered every two weeks. Another limitation is that candidate variables were not fully investigated to determine the risk factors of PCP development.",

Therefore, universal prophylaxis against P. jirovecii during R-CHOP treatment could not be strongly recommended. Well-designed studies addressing the cost-effectiveness of anti-pneumocystis prophylaxis in patients with NHL treated with R-CHOP should be followed to justify the usage of anti-pneumocystis regimen for prophylaxis. In addition, we could not conclude the association of cytoreduction with PCP development. Further trials should be carried out to identify the predictive factors of PCP development in these patients.",

Most common symptom was fever (29/32, 90.6 %), followed by dyspnea (25/32, 78.1 %), cough (18/32, 56.3 %), and sputum (34.4 %). Initial severity was classified as severe in 83.3 % (25/30) of patients. Diffuse ground glass opacities were found in all PCP patients, while consolidation, bilateral pleural effusion, and pneumothorax were found in only small proportion of patients. All patients with either definite or probable PCP received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) for first-line therapy. The median treatment duration was 13 days (IQR,[8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]. 87.5 % (28/32) patients received adjunctive corticosteroid. 13 (40.6 %) patients with definite PCP were admitted to the intensive care unit and 12 (37.5 %) patients needed mechanical ventilation.
