Most of this research has been fixed on chronic effects because of evidence pointing to deficits on psychological tests in workers exposed for many years. Acute or subchronic experimental studies would be more informative for our current purposes. First, they would be more representative of the conditions that arouse our concern; exposure standards for the space environment should derive primarily from their more immediate and short-term consequences than from the effects they might produce if extended over a working lifetime. Second, exposure conditions, such as ambient concentrations, can be specified and controlled, unlike the retrospective chronic studies that must rely on rather sketchy and often inaccurate exposure estimates.

Few facilities, however, such as the human exposure chamber located in the University of Rochester Medical Center, are available for the conduct of such research. In addition, most of the available performance data are based on batteries of relatively simple tests bearing little resemblance to the duties that flight crews are ultimately responsible for. The elements of most such batteries comprise cognitive function tests, psychomotor tests, and measures of mood. They are designed to survey a wide range of functions, and to serve as a tool for screening impaired workers, not to secure definitive information about any single dimension of performance. 2 Nor do they seek for complex dysfunctions such as impaired foresight or judgment. Nor are they suitable for tracing the kind of progessive decline in complex function that might ensue, say, from a slow solvent leak that remains undetected for several hours.

Controlled experiments in laboratory settings report similar findings. Trained athletes, exercising while breathing low concentrations of r~zone, often ceased performing even when lung function tests showed no abnormalities.
