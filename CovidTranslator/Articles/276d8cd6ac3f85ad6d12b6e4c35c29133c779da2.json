In this study, Real-time recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA-BP26) targeting Brucella spp. bp26 gene and Lateral flow dipstick (LFD-RPA-IS711) combined with SYBR-Green recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) targeting insertion sequence IS711 region of Brucella spp. bp26 gene, was developed to detect Brucella spp. from different sample types in domestic animals. The sensitivity and specificity of the two developed RPAs were compared with real-time PCR, PCR, and Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT). The analytical sensitivity and detection limit of Real-time RPA and LFD RPA were four and six copies per reaction respectively. The detection of six colony forming units (CFU) of the bacteria-bearing construct with the target sequence was within 20 min at 40\u00b0C for Real-time RPA and 37\u00b0C for LFD RPA. The LFD RPA could work at temperatures between 30 and 35\u00b0C and could be completed within 10-30 min. No significant differences were observed when comparing the results from Real-time RPA and LFD RPA to Real-time PCR and PCR. Both methods showed no cross reactivity with Chlamydia abortus, Toxoplasma gondii, Salmonella typhimurium, and Escherichia coli. In conclusion, RPA is a useful and convenient field and point of care test for brucellosis.",

It comprises twelve species, B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, B. ovis, B. canis and B. neotomae, B. ceti, B. pinnipedialis, B. microti, B. inopinata, B. papionis and B. vulpis [1] [2] [3] . The disease was eradicated in several countries by the implementing eradication programs, disease surveillance and control of disease spread. However the disease remains enzootic in many regions around the world [4] . There are numerous methods to detect brucellosis in animals. Isolation, identification, and bio-typing of Brucella spp. is considered the 'gold standard' method, and is useful for epidemiological studies, genotyping and molecular characterization. Serological tests, such as agglutination tests, complement fixation test (CFT) and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are widely used for the diagnosis of animal and human brucellosis in several countries worldwide. These test are also used for international trading purposes [5, 6] . Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used for the diagnosis of human and animal brucellosis and for direct detection of the pathogen in contaminated food products [7] . In addition, multiplex PCR methods have been developed to identify six classical species and subtypes isolated from marine mammals and some vaccine strains [8, 9] . Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms PCR (RFLPs-PCR) has been used for typing Brucella spp. for taxonomic and epidemiological studies [9] . Real-time PCR has also been used for the diagnosis of Brucella spp. infection in humans and animals from blood, urine and embedded tissues in paraffin wax [10] . Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been used for the diagnosis of Brucella spp., in infected mouse organs and contaminated milk [11] .",

For this reason, simple and rapid techniques are needed for the detection of Brucella in veterinary clinics. For establishment of successful control and eradication programs, reliable diagnostic techniques are needed for surveillance and investigation of disease outbreaks. Current bacterial isolation procedures and identification assays are time-consuming, require experienced technicians and put the laboratory personnel at risk [13] . Furthermore, current assays are affected by the number of viable bacteria in the samples and may be influenced by other bacterial and fungal contaminants [14] . Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal amplification method performed at temperatures between 37 and 42\u00b0C. The assay can rapidly detect target nucleic acids without the need for sophisticated laboratory equipment. It can detect very low concentrations of pathogen-specific nucleic acid within 20 min [15] .",

It is considered as a rapid and sensitive technique. This type of RPA does not need sophisticated instruments. Using lateral flow, dipstick strips could evaluate the sample after an incubation period of 10-30 min at fixed temperatures [18] .

The displaced strand combines with the labelled reverse primer, and leads to the production of a dual-labelled amplicon bound with FAM at 5\u2032 end and Biotin at 3'end (the major amplicon) also called FAM-Biotin linking amplicons [20] .

Upper to sample pad there is a line contains another immobilized antibody captures biotin, this forming the test line, and after the test line there is control line contain immobilized anti-species antibodies captures that antibodies ligated to gold nanoparticles. In positive reactions anti-FAM antibodies will bind to FAM in dual labelled amplicons, and then diffuse to test band line. In the test band line antibiotin will bind biotin and form red line. The remaining gold Nano-particles will diffuse to control line to be captured by anti-species antibodies and form another red control line. In the positive result, test and control lines will be visible in LF-strip.

Real-time PCR is faster and more sensitive compared to conventional PCR because it does not require post-amplification handling of PCR products. It also reduces the risk of laboratory contamination and false positive results. RPA assay time is about 20 min, and is shorter compared to PCR and real-time PCR. Real-time RPA could be performed using a small tube scanner(such as Twista) for fluorescence detection instead of qPCR thermocycler, and hence easily handled and used in the field. However, PCR and real-time PCR require sophisticated instruments and are not possible to be used in the field. In our study qPCR thermocycler has used for Real-time RPA incubation because of its availability in the lab. Table 2 . There was high agreement between RT-RPA-BP26 and RBPT (Kappa value = 0.8629).",

They can detect antibodies for other cross-reacting bacteria such as Yersinia enterocolitica O: 9 and E. coli O: 157 [5] . The results from Rose Bengal Plate test from sera and RT RPA-BP26 from vaginal swabs from the same ewes showed that the prevalence is higher byRT RPA-BP26 in vaginal swabs. Hence, Real-time RPA could be used to confirm infection and fill the diagnostic gap of serological tests. Bp26 based PCR was compared to RBPT for detection of B. melitensis infection in slaughtered goats. Among 138 animals, 23 (16.6%) were positive to bp26 gene PCR from tissue samples, whereas 15 (10.8%) were positive to RBPT from serum samples [21] .
