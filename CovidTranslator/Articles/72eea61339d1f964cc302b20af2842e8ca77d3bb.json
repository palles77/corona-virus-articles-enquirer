Bartonella isolates were obtained from 23 Eidolon helvum, 22 Rousettus aegyptiacus, 4 Coleura afra, 7 Triaenops persicus, 1 Hipposideros commersoni, and 49 Miniopterus spp. bats. Sequence analysis of the citrate synthase gene from the obtained isolates showed a wide assortment of Bartonella strains. Phylogenetically, isolates clustered in specifi c host bat species. All isolates from R. aegyptiacus, C. afra, and T. persicus bats clustered in separate monophyletic groups. In contrast, E. helvum and Miniopterus spp. bats harbored strains that clustered in several groups. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these agents are responsible for human illnesses in the region.",

Mounting evidence indicates an association of bats with various emerging infections, some with high mortality rates, including lyssaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome and other coronaviruses, and henipa, Ebola, and Marburg viruses (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . However, the list of pathogens discovered in bats is even more extensive and includes other representatives from various taxonomic groups (6) (7) (8) . Most infectious agents in bats are viruses; bacterial species have been rarely reported (9) . Excluding reports resulting from serologic and microscopic observations before the 1990s, only a few recent publications describe bacterial species in bats. One publication reports fatal borreliosis in a bat caused by a relapsing fever spirochete in the United Kingdom (10) . Another study on the molecular detection of hemoparasites infecting bats in southwest England showed the presence of Bartonella spp. DNA in the blood of 5 of 60 tested bats (11) . This report on bat infection potentially caused by bacteria of the genus Bartonella is consistent with studies showing detection of Bartonella spp.-specifi c DNA in ectoparasites collected from bats in Egypt and the United States (12) (13) (14) .",

Bartonella spp. organisms are highly adapted to a wide variety of mammals, including rodents, insectivores, carnivores, ungulates, and marine mammals such as dolphins. New insights into the natural history of various Bartonella spp. suggest that these bacteria have adapted to their mammalian reservoir hosts in unique ways with frequently restricted host species ranges (17) . The bacteria can cause chronic intraerythrocyte infections that sometimes result in a large proportion of the reservoir host population being bacteremic simultaneously (18) . Infections usually cause few or no clinical signs in the reservoir hosts. Host adaptation is evident as some Bartonella species and genotypes are found in very specifi c mammalian species.",

In addition to catscratch disease, trench fever, and Carri\u00f3n disease, other illnesses linked to Bartonella spp. infection range from a self-limiting, short-term fever to potentially fatal systemic diseases with cardiovascular, nervous system, or hepatos-plenic involvement (19) . Some Bartonella spp. that have been implicated as human pathogens are linked to rodent species; these species include B. elizabethae, B. grahamii, B. washoensis, and B. vinsonii subsp. arupensis (20) (21) (22) (23) . Other Bartonella spp. are linked to wild and pet carnivores. For example, B. henselae, carried by cats, causes catscratch disease in immunocompetent persons and bacillary angiomatosis in immunocompromised persons (19, 24) ; B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffi i is carried by dogs and has been responsible for endocarditis in a human patient (24, 25) . For some Bartonella spp. recently implicated as human pathogens (such as B. rochalimae, which was isolated from an American tourist traveling to Peru, or B. tamiae, isolated from 3 patients in Thailand), a mammalian reservoir has not been determined despite a wide range of tested animals collected in these countries (26, 27) . These unidentifi ed reservoirs indicate a need for extensive surveillance among diverse groups of animals for Bartonella strains, especially among bats, which represent around 20% of all mammalian species (6) .",

This study had 5 objectives: 1) to estimate prevalence of Bartonella spp. infections among diverse chiropteran species in Kenya; 2) to isolate and identify detected Bartonella spp. and create a reference collection of Bartonella isolates from East Africa with further characterization and diagnostic investigation; 3) to evaluate genetic heterogeneity of circulating Bartonella strains by using the partial sequence variability of the citrate synthase gene (gltA), proven to be an excellent genetic marker for analysis of Bartonella spp. (28) ; 4) to compare Bartonella strains obtained from bats in this study with strains obtained from other animal reservoirs and available from the public domain; and 5) potentially to identify new species of Bartonella.",

Detection of viable bacteria in a high proportion of bats in \u22656 bat species suggests that Bartonella spp. infection is highly prevalent in bat communities in eastern Africa. Some bat species tested negative for the bacteria; however, we had few samples from these species, making speculation diffi cult concerning whether those species are truly free from Bartonella spp. infection. However, we identifi ed some bat species that were statistically more likely to be infected with Bartonella spp. A high prevalence of Bartonella spp. in bats, ranging from 21%-88% in various species, is especially surprising considering the life spans of bats. Numerous investigations have shown that prevalence of Bartonella spp. infection can reach high rates in rodent populations, but rodents usually live no longer than 1-2 years, whereas bats can live for >20 years (6) . Explaining such high prevalence is diffi cult without assuming persistent infection. This hypothesis was not confi rmed for some rodent species, specifi cally for cotton rats; a high prevalence of Bartonella spp. in that population could be explained by replacement of diverse Bartonella strains sequentially colonizing an individual rat rather than by a long-term bacteremia (29) . This scenario is unlikely in bats because they have much longer lives than rodents.",

Bats carry a wide range of ectoparasites, including bat fl ies, fl eas, soft ticks, and mites, some of which are highly specifi c to bats (31) . Limited information is available to suggest that alternative mechanisms beyond vector transmission may be responsible for the spread of Bartonella spp. infections among animals. For example, identifi cation of viable Bartonella spp. bacteria in the blood of cotton rat embryos and neonates indicated a possibility of vertical transmission from a pregnant female to offspring (32) .

A strong association exists between specifi c Bartonella species and their mammalian hosts, whereas some observa-tions have indicated that 1 species of Bartonella can infect a variety of rodent species at a given site in Europe (35) . Our investigation indicated a defi nite host-specifi city for Bartonella strains in bat species. All isolates obtained from R. aegyptiacus, C. afra, and T. persicus bats clearly belonged to the specifi c Bartonella spp. group found exclusively in the particular bat species. By contrast, straw-colored fruit bats (E. helvum) and long-fi ngered bats (Miniopterus spp.) harbored strains clustered around 3 and 4 different groups of Bartonella spp., respectively, based on their gltA identity. Nevertheless, all strains of Bartonella spp. recovered from E. helvum bats were typical for this species of bats only. This pattern of cospeciation resembles the Bartonella spp.-host relations observed in cotton rats (18) (2) Rousettus \"R\" HM363764 (6) C l \"C\" HM545136 (4) Coleura \"C\" HM545136 (4) Hipposideros \"H\" HM545137 (1)",

The signifi cance of African bats in public and veterinary health is not understood because of a lack of surveillance. Bats are known as principal reservoir hosts of lyssaviruses. In Africa, these include Lagos bat virus, which circulates in pteropid bats (including E. helvum and R. aegyptiacus), and Duvenhage virus, which circulates in insectivorous bats (although specifi c reservoirs have not been established). In addition, Shimoni bat virus was identifi ed recently in an insectivorous bat Hipposideros commersoni (32) . Furthermore, multiple species of African bats have been shown to harbor coronaviruses (33) .

Application of antigens produced from bat-derived strains is especially relevant to serologic investigations of cases of infectious disease of unknown origin among persons occupationally exposed to bats. In addition, cocirculation of Bartonella spp. with other pathogens in a bat population can affect the bat's ecology and pathobiology. These aspects need further investigation.
