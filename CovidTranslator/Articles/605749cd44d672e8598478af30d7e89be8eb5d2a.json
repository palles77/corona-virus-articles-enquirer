Not only do these techniques facilitate the development of miniaturized instrumentation for biomedical analysis, but they also open a new era for integration of microdevices for performing accurate and sensitive diagnostic assays. A so-called ''micro-total-analysis-system'', which integrates sample pretreatment, transport, reaction, and detection on a small chip in an automatic format, can be realized by combining functional microfluidic components manufactured by specific MEMS technologies. Among the promising applications using microfluidic technologies, nucleic acid-based detection has shown considerable potential recently. For instance, micro-polymerase chain reaction chips for rapid DNA amplification have attracted considerable interest. In addition, microfluidic devices for rapid sample pretreatment prior to nucleic acid-based detection have also achieved significant progress in the recent years. In this review paper, microfluidic systems for sample preparation, nucleic acid amplification and detection for fast diagnosis will be reviewed. These microfluidic devices and systems have several advantages over their large-scale counterparts, including lower sample/ reagent consumption, lower power consumption, compact size, faster analysis, and lower per unit cost. The development of these microfluidic devices and systems may provide a revolutionary platform technology for fast sample pretreatment and accurate, sensitive diagnosis.",

It is a challenge to any health authority or center for disease control (CDC) to make an accurate diagnosis within a short period of time to prevent the pandemic spread of an infection. Many molecular diagnostic platforms, which usually involve real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), have become popular and powerful methods to specifically detect and identify infectious microorganisms with a high accuracy. In addition, these molecular diagnosis methods can be also used for preventive medicine and the rapid diagnosis of genetic diseases, which have attracted substantial interest recently. People who have defective genes may be screened and pretreated in advance if they can be diagnosed early enough. As a result, there is a great need to develop a compact tool for the rapid detection of genetic mutation and genetic diseases.",

            "text": "Most microbial and animal cells share physical similarities. A cell mostly consists of a jelly-like cytoplasm (70-80% water in weight) in which the cell constituents are suspended. The remainder of the cell is composed of cell membranes or walls, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Approximately 5-30% of the weight of a dry cell is attributed to nucleic acids, depending on the genome size, surrounding environment and the cell's current growth phase. The nucleic acids, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), play an important role in terms of storing genetic information, and maintaining normal metabolism and growth. DNA/RNA extraction is a routine procedure that collects DNA/RNA from various types of organisms. 133 There are three basic steps involved in DNA/RNA extraction including (1) cell disruption, (2) removal of sub-cellular components, and (3) DNA/ RNA extraction. In addition, purification and enrichment of a complex bio-sample at an extremely low concentration is crucial in many biomedical assays. These steps can efficiently increase the detection limit of the subsequent detection system. However, clinical samples are usually contained in a biological medium that would normally inhibit the subsequent DNA/ RNA amplification. Therefore, the extraction of the target DNA or RNA from a complex bio-sample is usually inevitable in clinical practice for most existing nucleic acid-based detection systems. These existing DNA/RNA extraction processes are usually time-consuming and labor-intensive though. Therefore, there is a great need to develop microsystems to perform these processes in an automatic fashion.",

It is a well-developed method for nucleic acid amplification in the fields of genetic identification and diagnosis. 92, 115, 116 Based on the proper selection of specific primers, the PCR technique can be used to perform nucleic acid amplification in vitro, resulting in the production of a large quantity of a target nucleic acid sequence. The specific primers are single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules of about 20-30 nucleotides, which are specifically designed to flank the two ends of the target genome. 117 A specific segment of doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) can be replicated during a thermal cycling process involving three different temperatures for denaturation, annealing, and extension, respectively. These denaturation-annealing-extension steps comprise one complete reaction cycle, which can rapidly duplicate DNA segments, 103 and are crucial in the PCR process. Thus, PCR provides a sensitive and selective means of detecting low numbers of, or slowgrowing, pathogens in clinical specimens, and hence has had considerable impact in the field of diagnostic microbiology. Table 1 shows a simplified process for molecular diagnosis. However, traditional PCR machines are usually bulky and relatively expensive. Besides, the PCR process is relatively time-consuming. Therefore, miniaturized devices for performing PCR processes rapidly are in crucial need.",

Then, at the boundary between the pinched and the following expanding microchannel segments, a force toward the center of the microchannel was exerted by the expanding flow profile, whereas a force toward the sidewall was exerted mainly on the RBCs. Since this method utilizes only the laminar flow profile inside a microchannel, complicated flow control mechanisms could be eliminated, which is usually required for other types of particle separation methods such as field flow fractionation. Also, this method can be applied both for particle size analysis and for preparation of monodispersed particles, since separation can be rapidly and continuously performed.",

In this channel, where the flow is laminar, the carrier flow occupies most of the channel width. When an electric potential is applied on the carrier flow, the dynamic behavior of the fluids changes with the magnitude of the applied voltage. Electroosmosis occurs when there is an electric double layer at the solid-liquid interface and it arises from the electrostatic attraction between the surface charge of the solid channel wall and the ions in the fluid. When an external electric field is applied along the length of the channel, the mobile positive ions in the diffusion layer move towards the cathode. The ions will couple to, and hence induce a dragging force on the bulk fluid, resulting in a bulk fluid movement along the channel. Generally, the pressure attainable with the EOF is weaker than that with a pressure-driven flow. Therefore, the EOF usually has a very limited effect on a pressure-driven flow. However, when the magnitudes of the two such generated forces are similar, this effect becomes significant. As a result, the hydrodynamic spreading of fluids can be tuned arbitrarily with an adjustable power supply. With this approach, separation of E. coli and yeast cells has been demonstrated successfully.",

Another study also reported that leukocytes could be isolated from blood by using a microfluidic diffusive filter. 122 Similarly, a microfilter separator for isolating white blood cells (WBCs) from human whole blood was designed using a cross-flow method in an array of microchannels. 131 Another silicon-based, cross-flow microfilter for WBCs separation was also presented. 50 An average separation efficiency of 70-80% for trapping WBCs can be achieved. Furthermore, a new microfluidic device utilizing a combination of T-junction focusing and tilted louver-like structures was demonstrated for bead and stem cell separation. 144 This two-step separation process was performed with a high separation efficiency of 97.1%.",

By using proper flow balancing of the outlets and the spatial positioning of the standing wave, a band of particles can be directed into a selected channel while a cleared medium is collected in other channels. This mode of operation represents an attractive way of implementing acoustically controlled continuous flow separators. Fractionation of suspended particles in a standing wave field utilizing the fact that particles with dissimilar sizes or physical properties are affected differently by acoustic radiation has also been reported. Larger particles will, for example, experience a larger acoustic radiation force than smaller ones, which means that they will move faster towards a node or an antinode than the smaller ones. By using flow splitters at the outlet and balanced flows, it is possible to separate larger particles from the smaller ones since they have travelled different distances. In addition, bio-particles can also be concentrated by using an asymmetric surface acoustic wave method. 145 However, such systems usually require complicated fabrication processes or costly equipment. Furthermore, cell samples may be damaged when applying external forces.",

Obstacles such as ridges and wedges embedded in the microchannel can be used to generate the inhomogeneous electric field. However, these obstacles may result in serious clogging of the channel. Recently, a microfluidic device was presented using a virtual, projected pillar array to induce a negative DEP force, thus eliminating the clogging issue. 6, 7 Alternatively, an optically induced dielectrophoresis (ODEP) device can be used to generate various types of virtual microelectrodes to manipulate beads and cells. 101 With this approach, there is no need to fabricate physical microelectrodes and beads or cells can be manipulated and separated.

Before excitation, the magnetic bead solution flows from the inlet through the microchannel and is evenly distributed between outlets. When a driving signal is applied to one of the pairs of the inductors, the magnetic beads will be sorted to a specific channel due to the magnetic forces exerted on the magnetic beads. However, the flow rate of the beads has a large effect on the separation efficiency. Furthermore, heating issues caused by the current driving scheme of the device should be considered.

DEP trapping is the trapping of such objects in high electric field regions, and a charged polymer like DNA has a strong length-dependent dielectric response at extremely low frequencies. Therefore, by using shaped insulating barriers, very high electric field gradients can be created to selectively trap the chromatin from a lysed cell. The idea for DNA purification is to trap the chromosome with an alternating current (AC) electric field while applying a small direct current (DC) electric field to remove the smaller components of the lysate such as proteins, RNA and membrane fragments.",

A similar method for extracting genomic DNA materials inside living cells utilizing functionalized magnetic particles was demonstrated. 153 When incorporated with microfluidic technology, the magnetic beads can be collected from a dilute solution near a large-scale rare-earth magnet to form a packed bed within a microfluidic channel. 38 More importantly, the magnetic beads can be separated and manipulated by   FIGURE 1.

For instance, miniature PCR systems using MEMS technology have attracted considerable interest. 3, 52, 115, 118 Typically, micro-PCR chips are classified into two major categories: microstationary PCR chips 27-30,34,59 ,71,88,90,97,107,123,125,142,150,157 and continuous-flow PCR chips. 13, 19, 22, 31, 56, 79, 94, 100, 102, 121, 126, 139, 156 Microstationary PCR Chips By modulating the thermal cycling program (including cycle numbers and reaction temperatures), DNA amplification can be performed in microstationary PCR chips, similar to the manner in which conventional PCR instruments work. Due to the relatively small dimensions of the microstationary PCR chip, it can perform faster thermal cycling as compared with its conventional large-scale counterparts, with a heating rate of 10-30\u00b0C/s and a cooling rate of 2.5-4\u00b0C/s. One of the critical issues associated with low duplication efficiency for DNA is an appreciable non-uniformity of the temperature field inside the PCR chamber. Therefore, challenges remain in maintaining a uniform temperature distribution inside a micro-PCR chamber and avoiding cross-talk issues for neighboring microheaters if multiple reaction chambers are required. 59,64 An M-shape microheater was thus fabricated inside a micro-PCR chamber to increase the temperature uniformity. 64 In addition, microthermal cyclers with different microheater patterns such as blocks, 71,79 serpentine shapes, 23, 107, 127, 149, 154 or fence-like forms 28 have been reported in the literature to increase the temperature uniformity.",

Typically, nucleic acid amplification has been achieved by driving the mixture of DNA templates and PCR reagents to continuously flow through a capillary or a microchannel that incorporates three thermally isolated reaction zones. With this approach, the time needed for the heating and cooling of samples can be greatly reduced. For example, a continuous-flow PCR chip using three sets of oil-baths and thermostats with different temperatures for annealing, extension and denaturing has been reported. 94 DNA samples flowing through a capillary tube were successfully amplified rapidly. Similarly, DNA samples were rapidly amplified by flowing them through a serpentine-shape microchannel on three copper blocks with different temperatures set for PCR thermal cycling. 56 Furthermore, different forces including hydrodynamic, 22, 56, 94, 100, 102, 121, 126 magnetohydrodynamic, 139 electrokinetic, 13 dielectrophoresis, 31 and pneumatic 19, 79 forces have been used to continuously drive samples through the microchannel for continuous PCR applications. For instance, DNA amplification utilizing a continuous-flow PCR chip integrated with a rotary pneumatically driven micropump was reported. 79 In this ingenious work, a flow-through rotary PCR chip was designed in which samples were continuously driven at a fixed flow rate along an annular channel using a pneumatically driven micropump through three heating regions. As the dimensions of the three heating regions were fixed, the time ratio for the three thermal processes remained constant, accordingly.",

            "text": "Although slab gel electrophoresis is commonly used for the analysis and detection of PCR products, this technique is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and produces only semi-quantitative results. High electric fields cannot be applied due to Joule heating effects and hence hinders the possibility for reducing the time required for analysis. In order to improve the separation efficiency, miniaturized formats for slab gel electrophoresis were developed, which are now well known as capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) and microchip gel electrophoresis (MGE). They are alternatives to conventional slab gel electrophoresis for fast DNA separation and detection due to their excellent separation performance. Moreover, a laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) system is commonly applied in these PCR-CGE or PCR-MGE systems due to its superior sensitivity and capability for quantification of the results. 155 However, a traditional LIF system comprising a laser source, a photodetector, filters, and mounting components is relatively bulky and somewhat mitigates the advantages of these miniature microdevices. Therefore, combing a PCR device and a CGE microchip as well as the detection system with integrated on-line detection in a PCR-CGE system is attractive for practical DNA/PCR products analysis. 57 In order to realized this system, an integrated microfluidic chip capable of performing DNA/RNA amplification, separation, and on-line optical detection in an automatic mode was presented, as shown in Fig. 4 . 44 In this system, DNA/RNA samples were first amplified in a micro-PCR or RT-PCR module and then transported to a sample reservoir through an onchip pneumatic micropump followed by being electrokinetically driven into a microchannel for separation and finally optically detected by a buried optical fiber. However, when amplified DNA samples and reagents were transported to capillary electrophoresis (CE) reservoirs by using electrokinetic forces, they will move at different speeds due to their different charge-to-mass ratios. This may affect the subsequent injection and separation process. The developed design overcomes this problem by using a series of pneumatic micropumps to manipulate the DNA/RNA samples prior to the electrophoretic separation process, and then uses conventional electrokinetic forces to perform sample injection and separation once the DNA/RNA samples have been amplified. Additionally, the high temperature field (>95\u00b0C) in the PCR chamber can cause a drying of the CE buffer, and hence can affect the injection of the amplified DNA samples into the CE channel. Therefore, the pneumatic micropumps also provide a micro-valving function such that the PCR chambers and the CE buffer reservoir can be effectively isolated.",

In order to detect different fluorescence wavelengths emitted from the different amplified target DNA, commercial real-time PCR machines with discrete channels of photodiodes, and a corresponding set of specific narrow-band filters and dichromatic mirrors were used to allow fluorescence with the desired wavelength to reach the respective channel. Biochips 65,126 and a multi-channel fluorescence detection method 141 have been proposed to realize the capability of multiplexed real-time PCR. To increase the fluorescence collection efficiency, one fluorescence input towards the corresponding photodiode detector can be separated into many optical wavelengths utilizing a photo multiplexer tube, and the fluorescence collection efficiency can exceed 70% for each optical channel using this sequential optical separation technique. 55, 80, 129 Another method to measure the fluorescence is to utilize a spectrometer with continuous spectral dispersion and a linear charge-coupled-device (CCD) array detector during thermal cycling in a real-time PCR machine. 65 However, a spectrometer with a concave holographic grating can only normally achieve a 25-35% collection efficiency for fluorescence wavelengths ranging from 300 to 800 nm, and the linear CCD array detector has the highest sensitivity for the spectral distribution corresponding to fluorescence only at 270\u00b0C; thus, the whole system including the cryogenic cooler is relative bulky and expensive for practical applications. Table 2 shows a FIGURE 4 . A photograph of the microfluidic chips capable of DNA/RNA amplification, electrophoretic injection and separation and on-line detection of DNA samples. First, the integrated microfluidic chip can perform two-step RT-PCR using pneumatic micropumps to transport RT-PCR/PCR reagents (reservoirs 2 and 3) to the PCR chamber (reservoir 1). The RT-PCR chamber performs the reverse transcription reaction on mRNA. Precise amounts of RNA reagents/templates can be first transported to the neighboring ''PCR chamber'' from the ''RT-PCR reagent chamber'' for reverse transcription of RNA templates using pneumatic micropumps. After synthesis, complimentary DNA (cDNA) samples can be further amplified after pumping PCR reagents from the neighboring ''PCR reagent chamber''. The two-step RT-PCR amplification process provides a more reliable method for genetic identification. If only DNA samples are to be amplified, then the reverse transcription process can be omitted. Secondly, these pneumatic micropumps could also act as microvalves such that PCR reagents and CE buffers could be properly separated (Huang et al., 44 Copyright 2006 Wiley-Blackwell).",

The quantitative applications of this method, however, may suffer from complications due to background amplification and variances in amplification efficiency. 35, 104 Hence, a great deal of effort is still needed to enhance the sensitivity and speed of nucleic acid detection and quantification, while at the same time, help to validate the quantitative reliability of the available techniques.
