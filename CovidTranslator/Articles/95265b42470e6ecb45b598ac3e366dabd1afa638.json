The recycling process may be conducted either: (1) in large-scale plants operated mostly in urban industrial areas, or (2) in small plants operated primarily in the rural environment to improve the farmer's income. Municipal solid wastes, sewage sludge, and other organic sludges may contain different kinds of pathogens that are infectious to several species of animals and plants, as well as to humans. The origin and nature of organic wastes and the different types of sludges always cause hygienic risks in storage, collection, handling, processing, and utilization. These risks exist if the organic wastes are collected and processed via source separation (biowastes), if they are collected mixed with other wastes from households or relevant processing industries, if they are generated in the treatment of industrial or municipal wastewater, or if the sludge results from industrial processing of other organic materials. Generally, three main types of risks are associated with recycling of organic wastes:",

Some of the most important parasites of epidemiological relevance are listed in Table 9 .7. From the protozoal ones, Cryptosporidium parvum seems to be the most relevant, while eggs of Ascaris species of humans and animals are the most important metazoic parasites. Parasites at large are not only important as pathogens, they may also be a risk factor as vectors in transmission of diseases from wastes to susceptible populations (e.g., by flies and cockroaches). Plant pathogenic parasites must also be considered, even if some of them are highly specialized on certain plants, which limit their epidemiological importance. Cyst-forming nematodes are the most relevant because these cysts may survive in the soil for several years. Roots and other soil-containing materials used in composting may contain such transmissible stages; more details can be obtained in the literature, such as in Menke (1992) . A selection of relevant nematodes is listed in Table 9 .8.",

Sometimes, only recommendations or legal demands are given by defining the particle size, minimum temperature, and exposure time, which are insufficient if they are not based on validation experiments or scientific investigations. A typical example is the requirement for composting in a reactor requiring a 12 mm particle size combined with an exposure time of at least 1 h and a temperature of at least 70 \u2022 C, as set forth in the European animal by-product regulations (EC, 2002) , which is not covered by any validation experiment.",

Therefore, sometimes recommendations are given on how to operate the composting process in order to achieve hygienic safety of the product. Such strict recommendations may be: \"Composting plants shall operate with the material at a moisture content of 45-50% and a pH of about 7. If the facility uses windrows, the exposure time shall be at least for a period of 2 weeks at 55 \u2022 C. If the facility uses in-vessel technology, the exposure time will be for a period of 1 week at 65 \u2022 C.\" From a scientific point of view, other combinations of temperature and exposure time will lead to sufficient inactivation of the target organisms, since those are mainly vegetative bacteria, viruses, eggs of parasites, or similar transmission stages and seeds. Even spores of Bacillus anthracis can be inactivated under certain circumstances, as shown by Miersch (1975) . Until now it is not definitely clear if transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) agents could be inactivated in composting; more research is needed in order to confirm or disprove the findings of Brown and Gajdusek (1991) , indicating that the scrapie agent may survive for more than 3 years in the soil. However, their experimental setup does not appear to be representative of the situation in composting. Nevertheless, inadequate technical design and improper management of the composting process may result in survival and transmission of the pathogens involved; therefore, only treatment in a validated process under steady supervision will lead to a hygienically safe product.",

Therefore, the possibility of validating a process by input-output analysis of certain indicators is, in principle, possible but under practical conditions a rare event depending on the microbiological properties of the input materials processed and other strategies that must be followed, e.g., process validation with one or more representative testorganism. If either the thermophilic process itself or if an additional thermal treatment shall provide the inactivation of pathogens belonging to the indicated level of thermoand chemo-resistance, representative test-organisms must be exposed in a similar matrix as that being treated in a suitable test-body in a defined validation experiment. The relevant process parameters must be recorded during the exposure in order to define the technical conditions to be kept for safe inactivation according to the results of the survival experiments. The validation of the treatment with respect to hygienic safety for animals, humans, and, if necessary, plants may be done in several ways. For example, the \"German LAGA M 10, 1995\" (LAGA-L\u00e4nderarbeitsgemeinschaft Abfall, 1995) offered a relatively broad approach for solving this problem with respect to composting based on the \"ATV\" (German Association of Wastewater Experts) recommendations from 1988 for sewage sludge treatment (ATV-Abwassertechnische Vereinigung, 1988) . Process safety concerning the inactivation of relevant transmissible agents for humans and animals is validated in two steps. The first step is the validation of the process as designed by the producer of the technical equipment in the basic procedure. The second step involves putting into service validation of a treatment process at the plant with the input material used under practical conditions. In both validation procedures, Salmonella senftenberg W775 (H 2 S negative) is used as a test organism exposed in specially designed test carriers. In such a validation procedure, testing is always done twice, in summertime and in wintertime. This is a very complete and safe system; if due to economic considerations the system should be simplified and only a one-step procedure should be the aim, it must be the one that deals with putting validation into service. A scheme of how this validation could be organized in this case, taking into account the annual throughput of material in the plants, is given in Table 9 .9 from the \"German Biowaste Ordinance\" (1988) .",

This system may also be used for phytopathogenic fungi and viruses (contained in plant tissue), as well as for seeds. Viruses not related to tissue may be exposed in the material, as described above in a type 2 test body. year plus one more sample for every 1000 tons throughput) 3. >6500 (12 samples per year plus one more sample for every 3000 tons) Total 60 a At small plants half the number of samples (\u22643000 tons/acre). b Every statement concerning the hygienic safety of the product is always based on the result of the supervision of the final product together with the result of the validation of the process. c Every sample is a \"mixed sample\" (about 3 kg) based on five single samples of the final product. The choice of test organisms and the techniques applied depend on the origin of the raw materials and the intended utilization of the product (B\u00f6hm, 2004) . Several test organisms other than Salmonella senftenberg, W775 (H 2 S negative) are in discussion for different purposes and treatment processes, especially in the Scandinavian countries (Christensen et al., 2001) . Some of the most important are: Enterococci, better known as Enterococcus faecalis, may be especially used for validating thermal treatment, since their heat resistance covers most pathogens in this epidemiological context, providing a high safety margin. The application of Enterococci for the general purpose of validation of composting processes, on the other hand, has some disadvantages. First, the quantitative enrichment is less effective than in Salmonella if contaminant flora shall be excluded. If the carriers are exposed to a composting process, it may happen that the test material is contaminated with indigenous Enterococci. In this case, contamination from the substrate cannot be detected in an easy and reliable manner. Finally, it must be kept in mind that Enterococci are more chemo-and thermo-resistant than most relevant pathogens in this field, but do not have any epidemiological importance in this context. This means that the application of test organisms must be strictly related to the process to be judged. If only a process of thermal inactivation like a pasteurization unit is to be validated, Enterococcus faecalis is the proper organism. If a thermophilic aerobic or anaerobic process shall be validated, it is more realistic to use the above characterized strain of Salmonella senftenberg because Enterococci would be too hard a criterion for this purpose since their chemo-resistance is different from the relevant mostly Gram-negative pathogens. For practical considerations, the proposed serovar Salmonella senftenberg has the advantage that it is rarely present in the raw material and can be easily identified by a natural marker (H 2 S negative) from accidental contaminants. Escherichia coli and Campylobacter jejuni are not as resistant as the above-mentioned Salmonella strain; the same applies to ECBO virus. It could be demonstrated that if dealing with a moderate epidemiological risk, e.g., given in composting source-separated biowastes, Salmonella senftenberg W775 will cover the most relevant viral pathogens causing notifiable diseases in farm animals and which may be present in low concentrations in the raw material. The time necessary for the inactivation of viral pathogens is generally shorter or in the same range as for inactivating 5 log of Salmonella senftenberg W775, H 2 S negative as has been demonstrated by Braumiller et al. (2000) , as well as Moss and Haas (2000) . The latter results are summarized in Table 9 .10; the results demonstrate the range of time necessary for reducing the infectivity of the tested viral pathogens for 3-4 log 10 steps.",

This is not only a matter of material properties and storing conditions, but also of proper management of tools and equipment from a hygienic point of view.

Since most bacteria will not propagate in a dry product even if nutrients are present, the product must be stored under dry conditions. The vapor pressure within the product should be in balance with a relative humidity of the air of at least 90%.

Since financial and technical limitations are given, one of the most practical means to come to a conclusion concerning hygienic safety of a product with a reasonable effort and limited costs is the application of a suitable indicator concept in combination with process validation and indirect process supervision. The indicator concept is only effective if the raw materials are relatively homogenous in their microbiological properties or certain (mostly fecal) contaminants can either be totally excluded in the raw material or have to be always present. This, in general, is not the case here, neither for biowastes nor for industrial wastes or organic sludges. This means that any indicator concept within this framework must be a compromise and the selection of a microbial indicator is extremely difficult and mainly influenced by underlying philosophies. Nevertheless, those indicator organisms must fulfill several requirements:",

The variety of species to be present in environment, samples, and materials resulting from aerobic or anaerobic biological treatment far exceeds the limited number of species to be taken into account in excreta, as well as in body fluids and the variability of species is high and not yet fully understood. Moreover, microbial parameters that are used in the field of water hygiene and food inspection are not applicable to substrates like manure, stabilized sludge, or compost because most of those indicators belong to the indigenous flora of agricultural soils (B\u00f6hm, 1995) . If the limited reliability and applicability of methods used in clinical microbiology and in water inspection for the intended field of use are taken into account, as well as the fact that the exclusion of organisms that generally may be found in normal soils gives no sense for a substrate and fertilizer such as compost or sludge, the following microbial parameters are inappropriate: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridium perfringens, sulphite-reducing Clostridia, and Listeria. Especially Enterobacteriaceae, for which threshold values are given in the EC regulations 1774/2002, are an inappropriate parameter in the evaluation of products after aerobic or anaerobic biotechnological treatment. This is due to the fact that this parameter does not correlate with the presence or inactivation of pathogens as can be observed in Fig. 9 .5. The data in Fig. 9 .5 show the results of input and output analyses in validated and non-validated composting plants.",

This means that it will make no sense if they are used as additional microbial parameters for describing a hygienically safe product. Enteroviruses are generally present in sludge of fecal origin but not regularly in sludges coming from other sources. In principle, enteroviruses may be used as additional indicators but the re-isolation procedures, as for all viruses from environmental samples, are labor intensive and costly. Their resistance in the involved treatment processes is not higher than that of Salmonella; this means that the additional information resulting from using these indicator organisms is also low. The same applies for rotavirus, even it is of special environmental importance, according to Metzler et al. (1996) and Pesaro et al. (1999) . Recent investigations have shown that coliphages do not correlate high with gut-related pathogens or other comparable fecal indicators even in substrates of fecal origin, as can be seen from Fig. 9 .6 (Samhan, 2005) .",

With respect to nematodes pathogenic to men and/or animals, experience shows that even eggs of Ascaris suum are less thermo-resistant than Salmonella, but behave differently in chemical treatment. This means that if Salmonella does not survive the composting process, Ascaris eggs and all other nematodes eggs would not either. This does not apply for treatment with slaked lime or long-term storage, especially in connection with organic sludges. This means that Ascaris eggs will not be a necessary indicator in all processes in which the thermal effect is the predominant one, but they will give valuable additional information if used in the monitoring of all other treatment processes.",
