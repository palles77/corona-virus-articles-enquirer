In 2013, outbreaks have been reported in Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the UK (England and Wales), Lithuania and The Netherlands. 2 In France, most cases occurred in children and young adults. 3 Overall, about 4980 patients were hospitalised, including 1023 for severe pneumonia and 27 for encephalitis/myelitis, and 10 patients died. 3 In adults with cancer, measles is frequently atypical and leads to progressive giant cell pneumonia, encephalitis and death. 4 5 Two fatal cases of measles pneumonitis have been reported in adults with cancer but none of them received any antiviral drug.

Ribavirin was stopped after 12 days of therapy because of its lack of efficacy on the course of the disease and the occurrence of haemolytic anaemia.

Factors predicting a poor outcome have not been examined in the literature. In our patient, the following conditions may have predisposed to a fatal outcome: (1) Hodgkin's lymphoma unresponsive to chemotherapy; (2) profound chemotherapy-induced neutropenia at the onset of the rash; and (3) sustained MV-induced immune suppression that was responsible for prolonged lymphocyte depletion (<250/mm 3 ) for 24 days worsening the patient's immune status.",

Therefore, measles were diagnosed using a real time RT-PCR validated to detect MV in clinical specimens but not for patient management. 9 The shedding of the MV into the lungs of immunocompromised patients has not yet been reported. 10 Although our RT-PCR was designed for diagnosis but not to quantify the viral load, the results of analyses suggest that the treatments lacked efficacy. Indeed, that viral shedding lasted for weeks at a significant concentration despite aggressive treatment.

The horizontal line shows an absolute neutrophil count of 500 cells/mL which is a major risk factor for invasive aspergillosis. BAL: bronchoalveolar lavage. Our patient received ribavirin as well as intravenous immunoglobulins. None of the two previously reported patients with malignant diseases received any antiviral drugs. A patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and a patient with rhabdomyosarcoma died from pneumonia. 4 7 Conversely, all three HIV-infected patients were treated with ribavirin and/or immunoglobulins. 6 8 One patient, who was treated with ribavirin before respiratory deterioration and immunoglobulins after endotracheal intubation, survived the disseminated measles, 8 while the other two, who received ribavirin after mechanical ventilation, had fatal outcomes. 6 These cases and ours suggest that ribavirin and immunoglobulins should be considered for use in patients with severely impaired cellular immunity as soon as the diagnosis of measles is established.",
