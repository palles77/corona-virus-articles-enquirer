The most common clinical findings reported by the physician were rhinorrhea, wheezing, and pharyngitis. These findings were much more common than difficulty breathing and retractions, suggesting that subjects had more upper respiratory symptoms and were not severely ill. Though all parents reported a recent fever at the time of recruitment, the average temperature of all participants with viruses recorded at the clinic was less than 37.8 degrees Celsius. Only 19.5% of participants had a fever greater than 37.8 degrees Celsius at the time of enrollment. None of the participants required hospitalization, affirming the likelihood of mild respiratory illness. Several factors may explain this finding. Hondurans in this region have had access to primary care since the introduction of the Shoulder to Shoulder health care system in 1990. Because of this availability of care, we speculate that some severe illness is prevented by early medical care. Further studies are needed to analyze the receipt of antibiotics in this population and its relationship to improved outcomes in viral infections. Additionally, we may have failed to capture severely ill children taken directly to the hospital in La Esperanza without initial triage in the outpatient clinics.",

Previous studies in Honduras 29 and Brazil 22 have identified RSV as the most frequent viral agent identified in hospitalized children with respiratory symptoms.

Reyes et al. tested for parainfluenza using immunofluorescence techniques and failed to identify any cases among hospitalized Honduran and El Salvadoran children 29 . To fully describe the patterns, further studies and extended surveillance are necessary to determine the relative frequency of influenza, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, and RSV over several years.",
