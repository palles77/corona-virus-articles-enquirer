Studies have reported that the fatality rates range anywhere from 36% to 70% based on the underlying comorbidities and severity of pneumonia. [3] [4] [5] Even people with no comorbidities can contract the disease and become critically ill. 6, 7 A major source of disease transmission has been linked to health care facilities, and health care workers exposed to cases of MERS-CoV can contract both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. 4, 8 A major outbreak of MERS-CoV occurred in the city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in the months of April to May 2014, almost 2 years after the first case of MERS-CoV was reported. 8 During this outbreak, a large number of cases occurred among health care workers (HCW), which were contracted within the health care facilities. 4, 8 Some of the HCWs even died from the MERS-CoV disease. 7 Moreover, it was reported that unrecognized, asymptomatic patients transferred MERS-CoV to their family or close contacts. 9 All these factors were alarming and potentially distressing for the hospital staff who worked during the outbreak.",
