Our study demonstrated persisting diarrhea and prolonged fecal shedding, but with a lack of significant intestinal lesions in gnotobiotic (Gn) calves infected with GIII.2 BoNoV, CV186-OH/00/US strain. Nine 4 to 7-day-old Angus/Jersey crossbred Gn calves were orally inoculated with 10.0-11.9 log 10 genomic equivalents (GE)/calf of CV186-OH (n=7) or mock (n=2). Calves were euthanized at post-inoculation day (PID) 1 (n=1) when moderate to severe lethargy was observed and at PIDs 2-6 (n=4) after lethargy had subsided. Two calves were kept longer term (until PID 30) for monitoring fecal shedding patterns by TaqMan real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Most infected calves exhibited two clinical signs: i) acute but persisting diarrhea and ii) acute moderate to severe lethargy. The two infected calves, followed longer-term, had prolonged fecal viral RNA shedding [peak average titer of 11.8 (\u00b1 0.2) log 10 GE/ml] at least until PID 20. By qRT-PCR, 5 infected calves had low viral RNA titers in serum, ranging from 4.0 to 5.8 log 10 GE/ml, at PIDs 1-5, but not (<2.7 log 10 GE/ml) at PIDs 6-30. The latter observation coincided with the presence of serum IgG antibody to BoNoV at PIDs 8-30. Collectively, the GIII.2 BoNoV strain CV186-OH induced only mild enteropathogenicity, evident by the lack of significant intestinal lesions, but it led to persisting mild diarrhea and prolonged fecal virus shedding in Gn calves. The prolonged fecal shedding of GIII.2 BoNoV might partially explain how this virus is maintained as endemic infections in cattle.",

They were initially identified in fecal samples from diarrheic calves in England (Newbury-2) and Germany (Jena) in 1978 and 1980 , respectively (Gunther and Otto, 1987 Woode and Bridger, 1978) . In the US, three bovine enteric calicivirus strains have been reported: NoV GIII.2 (Bo/CV186-OH/00/US) in Ohio (Smiley et al., 2003) , nebovirus (Bo/NB/80/US) in Nebraska (Smiley et al., 2003) , and NoV GIII.1 in Michigan and Wisconsin (Wise et al., 2004) . The economic impact of BoNoVs in the beef or dairy cattle industry is unclear. Previous virologic and serologic surveillance studies report frequent detection of BoNoVs in stool samples of diarrheic calves and high seroprevalence in adult cattle (Jor et al., 2010; Mauroy et al., 2009; Smiley et al., 2003) , implying a role for BoNoVs as a causative agent of calf diarrhea. The aim of our study was to characterize the pathogenesis of the GIII.2 BoNoV, CV186-OH strain in gnotobiotic (Gn) calves.",

Calves # 1 and 2 were inoculated orally with 11.9 log 10 GE of the CV186-OH strain, while calves # 3-7 were inoculated orally with lower doses of the calf # 1-passaged intestinal contents as follows: 11.0-11.3 log 10 GE (calves # 3-5) and 10.0-10.1 log 10 GE (calves # 6 and 7). After BoNoV inoculation, we monitored clinical signs daily until necropsy. Degree of lethargy was evaluated by the magnitude of loss of appetite and activity of calves. Diarrhea was assessed by scoring fecal consistency. Fecal consistency was scored as follows: 0 = solid; 1 = pasty; 2 = semi-liquid; 3 = liquid, with scores of 1 or more considered diarrheic. Scores 1 to 3 indicate mild to severe diarrhea, respectively. Calves # 3 and 4 were monitored for longer-term clinical signs and virus shedding until PID 30 and PID 21, respectively. Other infected or negative calves were kept for shorter-term studies and were euthanized for histopathological and serological examination at an acute-stage (PIDs 1-3), a mid-stage (PIDs 4-6), and a later-stage (PIDs 8-30) of BoNoV infection.

For comparison, the VLPs of Hu/GII.4/ HS194/2009/US NoV were also tested in this ELISA (Jung et al., 2012) . The CV186-OH/ 00/US and Hu/NoV/GII.4/HS194/2009/US VLPs, semi-purified by ultracentrifugation through a 40% (w/v) sucrose cushion, were used as antigens in a standardized antibody capture ELISA, as validated previously (Thomas et al., 2013) . Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Nalgene Nunc, Rochester, NY, USA) were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 1 \u03bcg/ml of either CV186-OH/00/US or Hu/NoV/GII.4/HS194/2009/US VLPs or with semi-purified Sf9 cell supernatant as negative control in 0.01M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). Blocking was performed with one of the 2 following blocking solutions: i) Blocking solution A, 2% non-fat dry milk (NFDM) in 0.01M PBS-T (pH 7.4), containing 0.05% Tween-20; and ii) Blocking solution B, 1\u00d7 buffered solution of casein (10\u00d7 Power Block\u2122 Universal Blocking Reagent, Biogenx, CA, USA) in distilled water for 2 hr at room temperature (RT). Four-fold serial dilutions, beginning at 1:4, of the bovine paired serum samples were added to wells, and the plates were incubated for 1.5 hr at Rt. A goat polyclonal antibody to bovine IgG (whole IgG) and conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was diluted (1:1000) in 0.01M PBS-T (pH 7.4). The plates were incubated for 1.5 hr at RT. The assay samples were developed with tetramethylbenzidine (KPL), incubated for 15 to 20 min at Rt, and stopped with 1.8N H 2 SO 4 . The absorbance at 450 nm was measured by using an Emax microplate reader (Molecular Devises Co., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Paired positive and negative wells with a resulting difference in absorbance greater than the cut-off value (average value for absorbance of negative control samples plus 3 times the standard deviation) were considered positive for CV186-OH/00/US or HS194/2009/US NoV antibodies. The antibody titers were calculated and expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution positive for CV186-OH/00/US or HS194/2009/US NoV IgG antibodies.",

However, the lethargy subsided or disappeared at later PIDs. Diarrheic feces were loose or occasionally appeared watery and yellow or yellow-green in color, and the amount was noticeably increased compared to control calves. No negative control calves showed diarrhea and other clinical signs, such as lethargy, throughout the experiment. Because of the clinical aspects similar to other bovine enteric viruses, such as rotavirus or coronavirus, further EM examination was conducted to confirm whether only NoV particles were present in the calf-passaged fecal samples.

The Gn calves infected with Newbury-1 nebovirus exhibited anorexia and maladsorptive diarrhea, and they also had intestinal lesions, such as atrophic jejunitis, in which IHC-positive cells were identified using convalescent antiserum to detect viral antigens Hall et al., 1984) . Our lab reported that the GIII.2 BoNoV, CV186-OH strain induced diarrhea, fecal virus shedding (RT-PCR), and seroconversion in infected Gn calves (Han et al., 2006; Han et al., 2004) , but no histopathology or IHC studies were conducted on the infected calves. A recent study reported prolonged shedding, as determined by qRT-PCR, of conventional calves experimentally infected with a Norwegian GIII.2 BoNoV strain (Jor et al., 2010) . For GIII.1 BoNoV, conventional calves infected with the Jena strain showed early, short-term shedding (RT-PCR and ELISA) (\u2264 PID 4) and diarrhea (\u2264 PID 3), but they all had severe atrophic enteritis (Otto et al., 2011) . Our study demonstrated that, unlike the Jena GIII.1 BoNoV, the CV186-OH GIII.2 BoNoV did not induce any major histological changes in the intestine of Gn calves, such as necrosis of intestinal epithelium, villous atrophy, or inflammatory lesions. Viral antigens/RNA were not detected in the intestine by IHC/ISH, indicating difficulties with in situ identification of this virus using routine pathology techniques, and thus requiring improved detection (IHC/ISH) methods with increased sensitivity. Thus, persisting diarrhea exhibited by the infected calves might not be related to virus-induced changes in the intestine as determined by histologic examination, but might be associated with virus-induced immunopathology or possible structural and functional alterations in the intestinal epithelium. Further studies are needed to elucidate the disease mechanisms related to GIII.2 BoNoV infection.",

Distinct from the GIII.2 BoNoV and human NoVs, the Jena GIII.1 BoNoV induced only a short-term diarrhea for 2 or 3 days after inoculation in neonatal colostrum-deprived, immunocompetent conventional calves (Otto et al., 2011) .",

Our findings concur with a prior study, showing that two colostrum-fed, conventional calves infected with a Norwegian GIII.2 BoNoV strain exhibited prolonged fecal viral RNA shedding lasting for PIDs 1-23 or 1-32 (Jor et al., 2010) . Likewise, volunteer studies using healthy adults revealed prolonged viral RNA shedding with a median time of 28 days (range 13-56 days) after experimental inoculation with human NoV (GI.1) (Atmar et al., 2008) . Also, in immunocompromised humans with GII NoV infections, prolonged viral RNA shedding with a median time of 289 days (range 107-581 days) was detected (Roos-Weil et al., 2011) . Unlike the GIII.2 BoNoV and human NoVs, the Jena GIII.1 BoNoV induced only short-term virus shedding for PIDs 0.5-4 in neonatal colostrum-deprived, immunocompetent conventional calves (Otto et al., 2011) .",

The enteropathogenic characteristics of the virus differed from the short-term diarrhea and fecal virus shedding that the Jena GIII.1 BoNoV induced in conventional calves, with remarkably severe atrophic jejunitis, suggesting milder enteropathogenicity of the CV186-OH GIII.2 BoNoV. Nevertheless, persisting diarrhea and prolonged fecal virus shedding that GIII.2 BoNoV induces, as confirmed in young Gn calves in our study, might contribute to establishment of an endemic situation of enteric disease in young cattle from dairies, feedlots and veal farms. In addition, our data suggest that enteric infection of Gn calves with GIII.2 BoNoV, CV186-OH strain is a useful model for comparative pathogenesis studies of other enteric NoV infections, such as human NoV, due to the pathogenic similarities (prolonged shedding) between GIII.2 BoNoV and human NoVs, as identified in our study. This model might also help to elucidate the role of innate and adaptive immunity in the clearance of NoV from the infected intestine or prolonged virus shedding and diarrhea.",
