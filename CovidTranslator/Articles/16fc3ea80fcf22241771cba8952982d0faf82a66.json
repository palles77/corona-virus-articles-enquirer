            "text": "Relevant pandemic-spread scenario simulations provide guiding principles for containment and mitigation policy developments. Here we devise a simple model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries and the number of Covid-19-inflicted deaths. For simplification, we assume that Covid-19 survivors are immune (e.g. mutations are not considered) and that the virus can only be passed on by persons with undetected infections. While the latter assumption is a simplification (it is neglected that e.g. hospital staff may be infected by detected patients with symptoms), it was introduced here to keep the model as simple as possible. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intensive care units. Some of the model parameters have been fitted to the reported cases outside of China 1 from January 22 to March 12 of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. The other parameters were chosen in a plausible range to the best of our knowledge. We compared infection rates, the total number of people getting infected and the number of deaths in six different scenarios. Social distancing or increased testing can contain or drastically reduce the infections and the predicted number of deaths when compared to a situation without mitigation. We find that mass-testing alone and subsequent isolation of detected cases can be an effective mitigation strategy, alone and in combination with social distancing. However, unless one assumes that the virus can be globally defeated by reducing the number of infected persons to zero, testing must be upheld, albeit at reduced intensity, to prevent subsequent waves of infection. The model suggests that testing strategies can be equally effective as social distancing, though at much lower economical costs. We discuss how our mathematical model may help to devise an optimal mix of mitigation strategies against the Covid-19 pandemic. The website corona-lab.ch provides an interactive simulation tool based on the presented model.",

As the number of infected people increases in a community, public health policies move away from containment of the outbreak to mitigation strategies such as social distancing and isolation, with considerable detrimental effects on public life and the economy. While less restrictive mitigation strategies would be desirable, alternative choices are limited due to a lack of resources and technologies. To better understand the potential effects of a particular mitigation strategy, we must assess the underlying factors that impact the spread of the outbreak, and therefore mathematical models integrating the relevant underlying mechanisms are a good tool.",

At the highest level one can categorize them into empirical/machine-learning, statistical and dynamical approaches [9] . Yet, due to the lack of sufficient data on Covid-19 pandemic (at this stage), it is more appropriate that we place our focus on the epidemic-dynamics models. Epidemic-dynamics modeling employs deterministic or stochastic methodologies to tackle the evolution of the epidemic inside a susceptible population. The former category belongs to deterministic descriptions where Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR), Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Susceptible (SEIS) models are among the manifested ones [4] . A more involved class of models incorporates the stochastic nature of the epidemic-spread via the framework of e.g. Ito-or Levy-type processes [3, 1, 14] . The discrete class of stochastic epidemic models involves random networks [2, 7] or agent based schemes [10] . Both deterministic and stochastic descriptions, at their fundamental level, rely on reaction mechanisms which characterize infections, recoveries and deaths within different sub-groups of the population.",

            "text": "While a few pandemic-spread investigations of Covid-19 have already been published, e.g. using the SEIS approach [13] and in a more recent study of non-pharmaceutical interventions [6] , no studies which investigate the effect of mass testing are found in the literature. To achieve this, it is necessary to separate the category of detected cases from infected cases that remain undetected (e.g. by the sheer lack of test kits) and predict their coupled dynamics. Note that detected here refers to persons taken \"out of the game\", which comprises not only those being tested positive, but also those who feel strong symptoms and thus stay in self-quarantine. It is further important to notice that in the case of this specific virus, infected people can infect others unusually long before the onset of symptoms due to the long active infection phase (the time of infection to infectiousness, i.e., the latency period, is shorter than the time from infection to disease, i.e., the incubation period). Therefore, early detection and containment of infected but symptom-free people can be extremely relevant for the dynamic behavior. Hence, in this paper we devise a set of reaction equations focusing on both detected and undetected categories. Moreover, the impact of the shortage of intensive care units during peaks of the pandemic are integrated in the outcome of the scenarios. The model coefficients are calibrated based on existing data, and the model is employed to investigate two main mitigation approaches, one relying on social distancing and one on more frequent infection testing. Also, a combination of the two is studied.",

Furthermore, we compute the number of fatalities (n k ) and the number of people who recovered after a detected or an undetected infection. Importantly, we assume that these people will have developed protective immunity and we assume that they cannot be infected again. The initial susceptible population n s,init is naive (i.e. it lacks immunity against the infection) and n s (t) is the number of persons who are susceptible at a given time t.

The rate q quantifies the number of persons being infected from outside, i.e., by travel or from the animal world. Infected persons either recover or get detected and go under quarantine, where they do not cause any further infections. It is assumed here that if someone dies, they get detected before or at time of death. In general it can be assumed that when someone falls severely ill the infected individual gets detected; an important assumption in the model is that detected persons are isolated and thus do not participate in spreading the disease.

One can assume that during the initial 50 days detection only occurred due to arising symptoms; therefore the detection time can be set equal to the incubation time. If one further assumes that the incubation time follows a log-normal distribution [12] with 5.84 \u00b1 2.98 days [8] , one obtains an average detection rate of k d = 0.2158 d \u22121 .

This means that the system can be stabilized by either reducing the infection rate (containment or social distancing) or by more frequent testing. This is consistent with the requirement that the basic reproduction number R 0 of the virus in the susceptible population is smaller than one. This number represents \"the expected number of secondary cases produced, in a completely susceptible population, by a typical infective individual\" [5] .

Figure 3 shows k k as a function of the fraction of detected infected persons. One can see that the death rate k k is constant until the health care system is at maximum capacity atn i|d = 0.0008. Beyond that, it increases and asymptotically approaches a value which is more than two times larger. Figure 4 shows the model results for a period of 200 days. Dashed lines represent the immune (n s,init \u2212 n s (t)), dashdotted lines the infected (n i|u + n i|d ) and solid lines the deceased (n k ) population. The model predicts an equilibrium when approximately 53% of the population is immune, which would occur after roughly 150 days. Further it predicts that approximately 2.8% of the initial susceptible population would eventually be killed by the virus. The peak of infected persons (approximately 10% of the initial population) is reached after roughly 110 days. Note that we do not claim that these results are quantitatively correct, but since the model accounts for the important mechanisms, it can be expected that it captures the relevant dynamics to a high degree.

In the logarithmic plot one can see that the number of infected persons remains constant during the social distancing phase (as expected when R 0 = 1), but the number of cases and deaths keeps increasing. Note that afterwards only a very small fraction of the population is immune. With some delay after social distancing is abandoned, the numbers raise exponentially until more than half of the population becomes immune. Figure 5c shows the case with 70% lower infection rate in the period from 50 to 100 days. This time the virus reproduction factor R 0 is smaller than one and the number of infected persons declines exponentially; seen in the logarithmic plot. After the social distancing phase there is a delay of approximately 200 days before the numbers climb exponentially until more than half of the initial population is immune. In both cases one obtains the same endemic state as in the base case, i.e., temporary social distancing only delays the main outbreak. Therefore, the success of a containment strategy eventually relies on discovering an effective and cheap vaccine in due time.

The results are shown in Fig. 6 and one can see that they are very similar as those shown in Fig. 5 . This demonstrates that mass testing would have a similar effect as social distancing, and provided effective testing methods become available, this approach has the important advantage that the world's economy would not come to a halt.

The corresponding plots are shown in Fig. 7 . One can see that extreme social distancing brings the number of infections down and moderate testing keeps the values constant. Again, after the testing phase ends there is a delayed outbreak leading to the same end result as in the base case.

However in the absence of such capacity, individuals would be tested at different schedules. Let us consider a situation where each person is tested once every N days. Therefore we focus on the set of days D = {1, ..., N}. An individual is infected at some random time x. To characterize x, we assume that the likelihood of getting infected does not vary much during these days. This is exactly the case, if testing is applied at an intensity such that R 0 = 1; see Fig. 7c . Hence x becomes uniformly distributed in the interval [1, N] . The incubation time, which is the time x s between infection and the onset of symptoms, is assumed to obey a log-normal distribution [12] . We assume an incubation time of x s = 5.84 \u00b1 2.98 days [8] . Moreover, we suppose that the testing result becomes available 1/2-day after the test is taken, and that the results are free from false negatives and false positives.

It is found that the latter can significantly reduce the percentage of people getting infected and the death toll. It is important to emphasize here that more testing has to be applied to individuals without symptoms, since those with symptoms contain themselves automatically in most cases. As improved testing capacities are built up, our approach may help to decide when alternative mitigation methods may not only complement, but eventually replace the current social distancing regime. This may help to minimize the socio-economical impacts resulting from severe social isolation policies. While social distancing is currently essential, it is of utmost importance that the testing capabilities are upgraded such that they cover large portions of affected populations in the near future.",

After a while, fewer and fewer infected people (who spread the virus) will be detected. In this way, continued large scale testing can verify the success of the mitigation strategy. Mass testing should be continued beyond this point, though at a reduced frequency. This would allow to detect if the fraction of infected person tends to increase. If this were the case, testing frequencies should again be ramped up. In any case, unless the virus can be defeated completely and globally by reducing the number of infected individuals to zero, there is a risk of Corvid-19 re-emergence after such mitigation measures are abandoned.",
