Additionally, it exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor-alpha which may ameliorate the immune reaction seen with viral infections.",

However, except for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus, these effects have not been replicated in clinical studies in humans. CQ did not prevent influenza infection in a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled clinical trial 7 . Further, there was no effect on patients with dengue infection in a randomized controlled trial 8 . Of concern was the observation that despite having antiviral activity in vitro, CQ increased viral replication and exacerbated fever in animal models of chikungunya virus infection 9 . Also, patients with chikungunya virus infection had more chronic arthralgia when treated with CQ vs. those treated with placebo 10 . The reasons for this discrepancy between in vitro and results from clinical studies are not very clear. One possible mechanism would be the failure of the drug to concentrate in target tissues. Also 50% effective concentration [EC50] of chloroquine for anti-viral effects is about three times higher than that necessary to inhibit chloroquine-sensitive malarial parasites 11 .",

            "text": "Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are among the highest risk individuals for severe COVID-19 disease and death 36 . Cardiac troponin Ilevels are significantly increased in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to those with milder forms of disease 37 . This may be similar to what is observed in many patients with acute respiratory illnesses; or it may indicate myocardial injury because of the virus as ACE-2 receptors are widely expressed on cardiomyocytes. American College of Cardiology recommends measuring troponin if the diagnosis of acute MI is being considered on clinical grounds and an abnormal troponin should not be considered evidence for an acute MI without corroborating evidence 38 . Similarly, patients with COVID-19 infection have elevated natriuretic peptides, significance of which is uncertain. Hence an elevated level of natriuretic peptides in COVID-19 should not be taken as an indicator of heart failure.",
