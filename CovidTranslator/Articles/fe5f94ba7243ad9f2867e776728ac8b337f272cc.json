He shakes his head '' no'' but wants to leave immediately. Before you can reassure him, he is at the door. His mother escorts him back to the waiting area. He does not return for the remainder of your shift.",

Her 14-year-old sister, Sibyl, remains unresponsive, still under the effects of anesthesia from surgery to repair internal and orthopedic injuries sustained in a car crash last night. Sibyl's face is puffy and pale, with a few superficial abrasions and bruises. Samantha grabs her mother and cries, ''Her face, her face-just look at her face. You said she was going to be okay.'' You explain the temporary nature of her sister's appearance, and Samantha becomes more upset. Sibyl begins to move and her monitor alarms. Samantha becomes even more distressed and is requested to return to the family waiting area.",

A critically ill child demands highly technical and patient-focused nursing; how we respond to their well siblings influences the view, the response, and the coping of well brothers and sisters. Although family-centered care is integral to the pediatric settings, the focus often is on the critically ill child and parents. The needs of parents are widely identified [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] ; however, little has been written regarding the brothers and sisters of the critically ill child. Nurses may overlook siblings and assume parents and other family members are supporting them; however, distraught parents may not have the insight to identify the needs of their well children [9] , not know how to explain the situation [10] , or even realize that well siblings benefit from being with their ill sister or brother. Siblings frequently remain invisible, are relegated to the waiting room, are rushed in and out, or are sent home with relatives.",

Although substitute parenting is undertaken in an effort to normalize the lives of well siblings [7] , these arrangements can produce feelings of vulnerability, uncertainty, and emotional abandonment [15] . Research is unclear on what care arrangements minimize sibling stress. Knafl [20] found that siblings cared for outside their home or by rotating caregivers had increased stress as compared with well siblings who were cared for in their homes by a consistent caregiver. Simon [16] found that siblings who were cared for outside their home by neighbors had less stress than did siblings who were at home with relatives; differences were attributed to the relatives being more upset. Sibling stress also was greater if parents expected well siblings to adjust easily to these changes [20] . Clearly, changes from the usual living situation or routine [15 -17] coupled with parental absence can create stress for the siblings.",

This egocentric perspective places themselves central to world happenings with illness resulting from something immediate in their lives. For the toddler, cause and effect are unclear, and creates ''magical thinking'' where thoughts influence happenings (eg, not sharing a toy with a sibling can be seen as causing their sibling's illness). Likewise, not thinking about an event can prevent its happening. Jamie, the 4-year-old who was described earlier, wants to leave his infant sister's bedside and refuses subsequent visits as a way of coping with a situation that he does not understand. Unfortunately, hospitalization also may be seen as punishment, especially if parents have used this threat as disciplinary measure [23] .",

Therefore, well siblings with previous illness experiences often have a greater understanding of their ill sibling's situation [27] , especially if many of the circumstances are similar [28] . In the third vignette at the beginning this article, Justin, at 10 years of age, demonstrates a mixture of concrete and formal logic. He asks about Sam's seizures, something familiar, but he does not understand the other unfamiliar aspects of Sam's intensive care.

McIvor [43] acknowledged increased risk to infants younger than 9 months of age because of immature humoral immunity. Personal colleagues suggest that siblings who are younger than 2 years of age have little concrete understanding of the situation and immature immune responses, and should be restricted from bedside visitation. Although actual infection risks to well siblings needs further investigation, parents need to be informed of the infection risks to well children that are inherent in any hospital setting, not only the PICU.",

Nurses need to examine honestly whether this is used as a way to protect siblings or a way to shield themselves from the demands and emotions that are generated by children visiting because sibling presence humanizes the critically ill patient [9] . However difficult, providing emotional care for the siblings can provide rewards that are not gleaned from other aspects of intensive care nursing, and provide a way of knowing the ill child though his or her siblings [45] . This points to the importance of providing parents and nurses with education that alleviates their concerns and policies that provide strategies to support siblings at the bedside.",

Although evaluation of these programs is limited, no reports of such programs within PICU were found. This may be due to the PICU nurses' comfort in working with children and broad acceptance of family-centered care within these units. Help from the clinical nurse specialists, child life workers, and social workers may be valuable. Because not all PICUs have these supports and many situations occur during off hours, education of the bedside nurse is essential for ensuring sibling support is available night and day. Sibling policy should be reviewed with all parents, even those not asking about well sibling presence, because it introduces the possibility of sibling presence. It also provides time for parents to share concerns about sibling coping and care arrangements, and offers the nurse insight into family dynamics, adaptation, and understanding of the situation.

Give them lots of time to find words. Get them to draw a picture or tell a story about how they feel or what they see For example, may think a ''broken leg'' is broken right off as with a broken dollAsk them about what they are feeling and give them lots of time to get their feelings and May think that their thoughts or actions caused things to happen (eg, brother is sick because thought they didn't like him or sister is hurt because they bumped them with toy) thoughts out Drawing pictures or telling stories with dolls or puppets may help Tell the child it is not their fault their brother or May have trouble sleeping, eat less, or be active after visiting sister is sick even if it does not seem possible that they might think that Only understand a bit of the situation Ask what they know about the situation Provide more information even if don't ask May say they understand to look more grown up Illustrations may help them to understand May not want to ask questions because they are embarrassed May feel guilty about brother or sister being sick or injured because can't help them Like to feel in control of situation May want 1 or 2 days to think about visiting and May be embarrassed if express emotion such as crying",
