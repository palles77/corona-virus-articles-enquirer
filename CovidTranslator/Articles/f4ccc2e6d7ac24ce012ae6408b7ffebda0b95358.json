No standard immunosuppressive treatment approach is able to control disease progression in patients with SAVI. We studied the efficacy and safety of targeting type I IFN signaling with the Janus kinase inhibitor, ruxolitinib. Methods We used DNA sequencing to identify mutations in TMEM173 in patients with peripheral blood type I IFN signature. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib was administered on an off-label basis. Results We identified three patients with SAVI presenting with skin involvement and progressive severe interstitial lung disease. Indirect echocardiographic signs of pulmonary hypertension were present in one case. Following treatment with ruxolitinib, we observed improvements of respiratory function including increased forced vital capacity in two patients, with discontinuation of oxygen therapy and resolution of echocardiographic abnormalities in one case. Efficacy was persistent in one patient and only transitory in the other two patients. Clinical control of skin complications was obtained, and one patient discontinued steroid Stefano Volpi and Antonella Insalaco contributed equally.",

One patient, who presented with kidney involvement, showed resolution of hematuria. One patient experienced increased recurrence of severe viral respiratory infections. Monitoring of peripheral blood type I interferon signature during ruxolitinib treatment did not show a stable decrease. Conclusions We conclude that targeting type I IFN receptor signaling may represent a promising therapeutic option for a subset of patients with SAVI syndrome and severe lung involvement. However, the occurrence of viral respiratory infection might represent an important cautionary note for the application of such form of treatment.",

Stimulator of IFN genes (STING)-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) is caused by gain of function mutations in TMEM173 [3] , which lead to a constitutive production of high levels of type I IFNs without infectious triggers [3] [4] [5] . SAVI is characterized by systemic inflammation, chronic anemia, growth failure, cutaneous necrotic lesions, and interstitial lung disease [3, 6] . Low-titer autoantibodies (i.e., anti-nuclear antibody, anti-cardiolipin antibodies) can also be present. Therapeutic management is challenging: steroids are partially effective; patients respond poorly to disease-modifying therapies, such as methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, antimalarials, infliximab, and rituximab [3, 6, 7] . Prognosis is poor especially in patients with a severe lung involvement, with a high mortality in the first two decades of life [3] .",

Skin biopsy of an active nummular violaceous lesion and a scar resolution of a preexisting lesion revealed granulomatous nodular dermatitis, with deep granulomatous folliculitis and secondary fibrosis. The child presented recurrent episodes of bronchospasm, recurrent fever episodes, and worsening of skin lesions. At the age of eight years, focal thickening of the interlobular septa with areas of ground glass opacities with predominant sub-pleural distribution were evident at chest CT (Fig. 1a) . A lung biopsy revealed lymphocytic aggregates in the peribronchial interstitial areas with aspects of capillaritis, and contiguous focal sub-atelectasis with macrophages infiltrating the alveoli (Table 1) . Immunological studies revealed increased IgG and IgE, normal lymphocyte subset distribution, and normal lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogens. Tetanus toxoid-specific IgG were below the protective level when tested at nine years of age (Table 2) . Spirometry revealed mixed restrictive and obstructive features (Fig. 1a , Table 3 ). Differently from the cases described so far, mild renal involvement (microscopic hematuria, mild proteinuria, no biopsy was performed) was also present, associated with hypertension. Steroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) ameliorated the clinical manifestations with normalization of inflammatory markers. However, disease relapses were observed during steroid tapering. Azathioprine and etanercept were ineffective. Peripheral blood type I IFN signature revealed the activation of type 1 IFN-induced gene expression ( Supplementary Fig. 1A ).

P3 did not perform respiratory function tests due to his young age ** Restarted oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg/day at 10 months because of worsening of the radiological signs of disease at chest CT NP did not perform, 6MWT 6 min walking test, FVC forced vital capacity, CRP C-reactive protein, ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Hb hemoglobin telangiectatic skin lesions and unilateral vocal cord paresis were also observed (Fig. 1b , Table 1 and Table 3 ). Except for the elevation of total IgA and IgG and a mild lymphopenia, immunological studies did not reveal major alterations (Tables 2 and  3) . Peripheral blood type I IFN signature was positive ( Supplementary Fig. 1A) . Targeted sequencing revealed a c.842G>A p.Arg281Gln mutation in TMEM173 [15] . Patient 3 (current age three years old), the only child of healthy, unrelated parents, presented at three days of life, with an erythematosus vesicular rash on the nose and cheeks, later spreading to her hands and feet with evolution to pustules and scars ( Fig. 1c and Table 1 ). She was admitted at the age of three months with recurrent low-grade fever, cough, diarrhea, and dermatitis variably responsive to glucocorticoids and antibiotics in the suspect of a combined immunodeficiency. Skin biopsy was consistent with neutrophilic dermatosis with karyorrhexis throughout the vessel wall (Fig. 1d) . Chest CT revealed focal thickening of the interlobular septa with areas of ground glass opacities. Blood investigations revealed microcytic anemia, increased acute-phase reactants, hypergammaglobulinemia, mild reduction of C3 levels, and low-titer autoantibodies (anti-cardiolipin), with a normal distribution of lymphocyte subsets. Lymphocyte proliferation was normal in response to PHA and low but present in response to OKT3 (Tables 1 and 2) . Peripheral blood type I IFN signature was positive (Supplementary Fig. 1A) . The patient was started on glucocorticoids (1 mg/kg/day prednisone) with improvement of clinical and laboratory findings, but recurrence of symptoms at tapering. Targeted genome sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous mutation in TMEM173 c.461A>G (p.Asn154Ser).",

However, contrary to published reports, we observed several episodes of severe viral infections in one patient, suggesting the possibility that JAK inhibitors might significantly increase the risk of infections possibly in cases of more severe lung involvement or in the presence of genetic modifiers, not investigated in our patient, with consequent deterioration of t he lung disease. Interestingly, the most frequent virus isolated was rhinovirus, which may be a direct consequence of effective type I IFN inhibition by ruxolitinib at least in respiratory epithelial cells, where IFN-\u03b2 is required to control rhinovirus [16, 17] . On the other end, these infections might result from a cumulative effect of the drug with the reported developmental and in vitro proliferative defects of STING mutant T lymphocytes [18, 19] . Considering the severity of lung disease and the lymphopenia (Table 2 ) present before ruxolitinib treatment, P2 was started on antibiotic prophylaxis with Bactrim and Azithromycin; that, however, did not seem to prevent the febrile episodes, mostly if not always caused by viral pathogens. Of note, the patient is now on IVIG prophylaxis and no severe infections have been reported so far. Whether this is due to ruxolitinib reduction and/ or IVIG treatment, it is difficult to understand.",

Several factors might have played a role, including variability of disease severity and inadequate plasma drug levels. Indeed, while all patients were steroid dependent and required several hospital admissions to treat flares, P2 and P3 appear to have a more severe phenotype, with P2 presenting several life-threatening exacerbations requiring admission to ICU and ventilator support during infection episodes and P3 presenting a very early disease onset (three days of life). Additionally, despite dose adjustment and plasma level monitoring, drug dosage appeared to be stably adequate only in P1 (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1) . Notably, we reduced ruxolitinib dosage in P2 after one year of therapy, in the attempt to prevent infections (Fig. 1c) .",

            "text": "Overexpression of a set of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in peripheral blood has consistently been found in all reported patients with SAVI syndrome [6, 14, 15] . Modulation of IFN signature following treatment may represent a surrogate biomarker. However, we did not observe a consistent decrease in IFN signature during the treatment. In previous reports of ruxolitinib treatment in patients with SAVI [9, 10, 20] , only a partial or no decrease in IFN signature was observed. The lack of downregulation of IFN signature might be explained by the fast kinetic of JAK inhibition by ruxolitinib as shown by the transient decrease in pSTAT1 following drug intake [9] which seems not to be coupled with a clear impact on ISG expression ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . Otherwise, it might suggest that the six gene-based test is not appropriate to assess type I interferon activation at least in patients with SAVI treated with a JAK inhibitor. Finally, it is important to consider that ruxolitinib inhibits not only the signaling of type I interferon receptor but also that of other receptors involved in important inflammatory pathways such as IL6, IL12/23, and interferon \u03b3. It is possible that the inhibition of some or all of these pathways is responsible for the therapeutic efficacy (and side effects) we see in SAVI.",
