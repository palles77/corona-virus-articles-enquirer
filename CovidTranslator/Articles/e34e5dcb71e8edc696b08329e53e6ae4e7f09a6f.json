            "text": "These disorders are characterized by inspiratory dyspnea. The increased resistance to airfl ow caused by upper airway obstructions often creates audible inspiratory noise and results in referred airway sounds through the tracheobronchial apparatus. Sounds that have been \"referred\" to the lower airway from an upper airway obstruction may be misinterpreted as lower airway in origin unless the upper airway is examined and the trachea ausculted in such cases. If the respiratory sounds can be heard without a stethoscope, they are most likely originating from the upper respiratory tract. The upper airway examination should include detection of airfl ow from both nostrils, close examination of soft tissues of the head, and oral examination if necessary. Severe upper airway obstruction can cause open mouth breathing and head extension as the affected cow tries to decrease the resistance to airfl ow (Figure 4-1).",

Congenital disorders including pharyngeal cysts of respiratory epithelial origin, nasal cysts, cystic nasal conchae, skull anomalies, laryngeal malformations, and branchial cysts have been observed in calves and adult cows. Inspiratory dyspnea with audible snoring sounds or stertorous breathing is a sign common to most of these problems. The condition may be present at birth or is most often observed within the fi rst few months of life. The degree of dyspnea associated with these abnormalities tends to be progressive as a result of either enlargement of the lesion (cyst) or worsening upper airway edema and swelling from the mechanical overwork associated with respiratory efforts to move air through an airway narrowed by malformations. Diagnosis. Specifi c diagnosis requires physical examination, including visual inspection of the nares and oral cavity, endoscopy, and skull radiographs (Figure 4 -2). In addition, aspiration for cytology and cultures may be indicated for cystic lesions. Most cystic lesions will be secondarily infected.",

Simple drainage or drainage with cautery of cystic lesions is not likely to be successful. Therefore referral of such cases to veterinary surgeons experienced in upper airway surgery is recommended so that comp lete excision of the secretory epithelium can be comp leted. Other conditions such as laryngeal malformations and skull anomalies have a poor prognosis. Regardless of cause, symptomatic or supportive treatment may be necessary before diagnostic procedures are performed in calves with severe dyspnea, lest the stress of examination or endoscopy induce anoxia. A tracheostomy should be considered to allow safe diagnostic manipulation. Misinterpreting anoxic patient struggling as wildness requiring additional physical restraint is a frequent, and potentially fatal, error in judgment made by inexperienced clinicians. When a dyspneic animal struggles during examination, usually it is anoxic, frightened, and extremely anxious. All restraint of the head and neck should be relaxed, and the animal should be allowed to \"get its breath.\" Continued restraint during these situations will result in asphyxiation of the animal.",

Most of the lesions represent enlargement or infl ammation of tissues and structures external to the airway itself. Impingement into the upper airway by soft tissue masses such as pharyngeal abscesses, retropharyngeal cellulitis, necrotic laryngitis, pyogranulomatous swellings (e.g., wooden tongue), enlarged lymph nodes, neoplasms, foreign bodies, or enlarged maxillary sinuses compose the majority of lesions. Pharyngeal abscesses and necrotic laryngitis are probably the most common acquired causes of obstruction. Pharyngeal abscesses and retropharyngeal cellulitis may occur following traumatic injury to the mouth when an animal is treated with oral medication or may arise in calves with no history of pharyngeal trauma. Regardless of cause, progressive inspiratory dyspnea is the primary sign observed in affected cattle. Fever may be present with pharyngeal abscesses or chronic maxillary sinusitis. Unilateral nasal discharge or reduced airfl ow from one nostril may be present with maxillary sinusitis or unilateral neoplasms of the nasal pharynx or maxillary sinus. Lymphadenopathy may be present as a primary sign in neoplastic conditions, such as juvenile lymphosarcoma and adult lymphosarcoma , or as a secondary sign, in cases of soft tissue infections. Unilateral Horner's syndrome and progressive exophthalmos have been observed in slow-growing adenocarcinomas of respiratory epithelial origin in the nasal pharynx . Cattle with unilateral nasal obstruction often show more obvious respiratory signs during hot weather. One cow with Horner's syndrome would demonstrate open mouth breathing on hot days because of the nasal mucosal vasodilation and edema . A fetid odor may exist on the breath caused by chronic infl ammation or tumor necrosis in some cattle. The owner may report a progressive course of stertorous breathing eventually leading to open mouth breathing. Infl ammatory lesions often have a more acute course than neoplasms, but this is a generality rather than a rule. Obvious external swelling may be ",

External drainage is technically diffi cult in deep pharyngeal abscesses located more than a few centimeters below the skin surface.

If recurrence is obvious, culture and sensitivity coupled with drainage through multiple sites are indicated. Daily fl ushing of the drainage sites is important. Systemic antibiotics should be administered for 1 to 2 weeks following drainage; Arcanobacterium pyogenes (A. pyogenes) and Fusobacterium spp. are the most common organisms cultured, so penicillin is the most commonly used antibiotic.

Signs include a progressively enlarging mass in one nostril and inspiratory dyspnea as the lesion enlarges to occlude the nostril completely. The granulomas may originate at the site of nose-lead lesions of the mucosa near the nasal septum or at other mucosal sites of soft tissue injury from foreign bodies or fi brous feed.

In some calves, the lesions can be seen by using an oral speculum, but endoscopy is much easier and less stressful for the patient. If the calf is in extreme dyspnea or is anoxic or cyanotic, a tracheostomy should be performed before endoscopy. The larynx will be found to be uniformly swollen and may appear to have cartilaginous deformities in chronic cases (Figure 4 -13). The laryngeal opening always is narrowed, and mucosal necrosis will be present in acute cases. Chronic cases may have laryngeal deformity and airway narrowing, but the necrotic, infected cartilage may be covered by normal mucosa (see video clips 6 to 8). Treatment. Long-term therapy is required because infection of cartilaginous structures usually exists. Acute cases should be treated with penicillin (22,000 U/kg IM, twice daily). A tracheostomy is essential for treatment of calves that have severe dyspnea. This will provide a patent airway and rest the infected larynx from further exertional irritation while the infection is controlled. The prognosis for acute cases is fair. Chronic cases have a poor prognosis because laryngeal deformity and cartilaginous necrosis or abscesses within the laryngeal cartilage already have developed. Treatment is similar to that described for acute cases but should be extended to 14 to 30 days in patients valuable enough to warrant treatment, or the necrotic cartilage should be surgically removed or debrided. A tracheostomy may be necessary for the reasons listed above, and some clinicians recommend concurrent treatment with sodium iodide in the hope of penetrating the deepseated infection of cartilage. A. pyogenes frequently contributes to or replaces F. necrophorum as the causative organism in chronic infections because these two organisms are synergistic.

Virulent strains of Mannheimia haemolytica and Histophilus somni are primary pathogens capable of causing acute infections of the lower airway and lung parenchyma. These organisms do not always require the help of environmental and management stressors or other infectious agents to cause pneumonia. Chronic lower airway infections by P. multocida and A. pyogenes may cause pneumonia in calves either previously infected or coinfected with viral or Mycoplasma pathogens of the respiratory tract or in animals stressed by shipment, poor management, or ventilation insuffi ciencies. Chronic suppurative pneumonia in acute cattle may be the result of previous as piration pneumonia; a combination of P. multocida, A. pyogenes, Fusobacterium, and Mycoplasma sp. are frequently cultured. Aspiration pneumonia associated with these same bacterial pathogens may also be observed in calves with white muscle disease, calves fed via an inappropriately large opening on the nipple of milk feeding bottles, premature calves with inadequately developed protective refl exes of the glottis, and calves with retropharyn geal diseases that interfere with normal upper airway refl exes. It is imperative for the bovine practitioner to understand the causes, predisposing factors, treatment, control, and prevention of these pathogens. In addition, it must be emphasized that the only way to diagnose and control contagious respiratory disease in cattle is to know the exact identity of the pathogens and predisposing causes. This can be accomplished only by careful history, thorough physical examination, collection of appropriate samples, and collabora tion with a diagnostic laboratory capable of identifying all known bovine respiratory pathogens. The fi ve major bacterial pathogens of the bovine lower airways currently are M. haemolytica, P. multocida, Mycoplasma spp., H. somni, and A. pyogenes. They will be discussed separately.

M. haemolytica is a gramnegative rod that may be a normal inhabitant of the upper airway but is not cultured from the upper airway of normal cattle as frequently as P. multocida. Several properties of M. haemolytica contribute to its pathogenicity. These include a capsule that provides defense against phagocytosis; production of an exotoxin (leukotoxin) lethal to alveolar macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils; cell wall-derived endotoxin that helps to initiate complement and coagulation cascades; and the ability to reside in the upper airway among other nonpathogenic serotypes and then convert and/or overgrow under stressful stimuli to a pathogenic serotype, A1, that is more virulent. The cytotoxicity of the leukotoxin is associated with its ability to bind and interact with \u232a2 integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen 1. Currently M. haemolytica is a leading cause of death as a result of respiratory infection in dairy cattle and calves in most areas of the United States. This organism is a primary pathogen not always needing assistance from other viral or Mycoplasma agents to establish lower airway infection, although it is well demonstrated that bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) infection can activate genes that will increase leukotoxin binding, cytotoxicity to bovine mononuclear cells, and the severity of M. haemolytica infection. When a virus such as IBR, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), or bovine virus diarrhea virus (BVDV) does infect a herd, mortality will be greatly increased if M. haemolytica bronchopneumonia is superimposed. In this situation, the bacteria may cause death because the viral infection compromises mechanical and cellular defense mechanisms. Mortality may approach 30% to 50% when a virulent M. haemolytica infection is superimposed on a preexisting viral infection (e.g., BHV1 or BVDV) in a herd. Cattle that are stressed are at great risk of M. haemolytica pneumonia because stress triggers both activation of the organism to a more virulent form, permits greater colonization of the virulent strain, and compromises the host defense mechanisms. Thus M. haemolytica is frequently isolated as the cause of \"shipping fever pneumonia\" associated with shipment of cattle, transport of cattle to shows, or recent purchase of replacement animals. Classic signs of pneumonia generally develop 1 to 2 weeks following any of these stresses. The morbidity and mortality percentages tend to be much greater for M. haemolytica pneumonia outbreaks than if P. multocida is found as the cause of shipping fever. A great deal of variation in pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance exists for various isolates of M. haemolytica. Therefore the veterinarian must accept the fact that signs produced by these types will vary from mild to severe. Mild infections or less pathogenic M. haemolytica may mimic P. multocida with respect to clinical signs and response to therapy, whereas severe infections may be so drastic as to cause death within hours of the fi rst clinical signs. In rare instances the death can be so peracute that toxicity is expected. A less pathogenic form has been seen causing high fever in recently fresh cows, all of which had a remarkably quick recovery following treatment with ceftiofur.",

Signs in acutely affected cattle include high fever (106.0 to 108.0\u00b0 F/41.11 to 42.22\u00b0 C), marked depression, salivation, increased respiratory rate (60 to 120 breaths/min), complete anorexia and milk cessation, reluctance to move, absence of rales when the ventral lungs are ausculted, profound bronchial tones bilaterally that indicate consolidation of 25% to 75% of the ventral pulmonary parenchyma , and quiet or inaudible sounds in the dorsal lungs where the remaining pulmonary tissue has been subjected to extreme mechanical and physiologic stress to maintain gas exchange. Subcutaneous emphysema and pulmonary edema are common sequelae in these cattle. Ventral abdominal pain can be elicited in the cranial abdomen as a result of the fi brinous pleuritis present. This pain and absence of rumen activity coupled with the other signs have caused many veterinarians to confuse the initial case of rapidly consolidating pneumonia as peritonitis caused by hardware or perforating abomasal ulcer. The major reason for this error is the absence of rales with this form of M. haemolytica. Therefore we have had to \"retrain\" our ears to auscult carefully for bronchial tones versus normal or harsh vesicular sounds. Careless auscultation of air sounds in the ventral lung fi eld may not discriminate between bronchial tones and vesicular sounds.

Once again, the veterinarian is forced to use \"best guess\" judgment when selecting an initial antibiotic in such cases. Following collection of appropriate diagnostic samples, antibiotic therapy should commence immediately. Because life-threatening signs usually appear in at least some of the affected cattle, the veterinarian is more likely to select broad-spectrum anti biotics immediately. The current popular antibiotics for cows and calves are shown in Table 4 -1. Even when the causative bacterial organism is known, antibiotic therapy may be unable to cure the patient for a variety of reasons, such as the chosen antibiotic does not reach adequate tissue levels in the lung; the organism is resistant to the antibiotic; the organism is sensitive in vitro but in vitro inhibitory concentrations do not occur in the cow as a result of the dose, frequency of dosage, or other pharmacologic considerations; the drug may not be able to penetrate consolidated tissue or work in purulent tissue; and in vitro susceptibility tests may not refl ect in vivo success of an antibiotic against a specifi c organism-thus the Kirby-Bauer disc assay has been criticized as too gross compared with mean inhibitory or bactericidal concentration tests that can give a concentration of drug that inhibits or kills an organism. This mean inhibitory concentration then can be compared with known achievable blood and tissue levels of the antibiotic in the cow to determine likelihood of successful treatment. The pathology may be irreversible or viral, and Mycoplasma or A. pyogenes pathogens may coexist to complicate the treatment plan. Textbook charts that quote percentages of isolates sensitive to various antibiotics are seldom helpful because both geographic differences in strains and temporal resistance patterns occur. Appropriate withdrawal times for any antibiotic selected for milk and slaughter residues must be known and observed and may shape decisions by the producer as to which antibiotic is chosen so that an immediate slaughter option is maintained. The industry continues to seek the \"silver bullet\"-a magic antibiotic that will cure all cases of Mannheimia pneumonia. This silver bullet would take away the need for diagnostic work or preventive medicine, excuse management techniques that predispose to pneumonia, and of course would only be available through veterinarians. As a profession, we persist in overuse of every new antibiotic that becomes available. We ask these antibiotics to do things that cannot be done while igno ring older time-tested antibiotics. The silver bullet does not and will not exist. Improvement in response to appropriate antibiotic therapy will appear as better attitude and appetite and a decreasing fever within 24 hours. A decrease of 2\u00b0 F or more should be considered clinically indicative of improvement. The body temperature continues to decrease into the normal range over 48 to 72 hours in most cases that have been treated with appropriate antibiotics. Depending on which antibiotic is used, a minimum of 3 days of antibiotic treatment is often required, and more often 5 to 7 days of continuous therapy are necessary and less likely to result in recurrence.",

The two general groups of drugs include corticosteroids and NSAIDs, such as aspirin and fl unixin meglumine. Corticosteroids have a marked antiinfl ammatory and antipyretic activity that often leads to a \"steroid euphoria\" with resultant improved attitude and appetite within 24 hours. Although corticosteroids have these positive effects and also block several parts of the infl ammatory cycle, they are dangerous if used repeatedly or in high dosages. Corticosteroids may reduce some of the chemotactic factors and lysosomal enzymes that cause a vicious cycle of increasing infl ammation in the lung and tend to stabilize small vessels. However, they also partially or completely inhibit macrophage activation and antimicrobial peptide expression, which are serious detriments to the defense mechanisms of the lower airway. If the veterinarian elects to use corticosteroids, one treatment of low-dose (10 to 20 mg/450 kg) dexamethasone may be given as part of the initial therapy and should not be used thereafter. This treatment cannot be used in pregnant cows because of the abortifacient qualities of dexamethasone. Corticosteroids have potent antipyretic properties, and this may lead to a false sense of security because the veterinarian may assume that the proper antibiotic has been used based on a decreasing fever 24 hours following treatment when in fact the antibiotic has not been effective and fever will return 24 to 48 hours later.

Examples include changeable temperature and humidity when calves are grouped during the indoor housing season (especially fall, spring, and during winter thaws), broken fans, failure to clean large pens when calves have been in groups for weeks to months, lungworms, and drafts that the confi ned calves cannot escape. Fresh air is vital to recovery and should be provided even if it means allowing the animals access to outside air in inclement weather.",

Bronchopneumonia caused by P. multocida alone usually is a management problem. Although it certainly is recognized that previous viral infection or mixed infections (e.g., Mycoplasma) could and do predispose to P. multocida pneumonia in calves and cattle, it must be emphasized that management factors are very important. Secondary P. multocida pneumonia, such as that following viral respiratory infection, will be discussed in conjunction with viral diseases. Failure of cattle affected with P. multocida pneumonia to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy based on culture and susceptibility results should alert the veterinarian to the fact that (1) P. multocida is not the only agent involved in the epidemic (i.e., a virus or Mycoplasma also may be present or was present-therefore viral isolation, paired serology, and so forth are indicated); (2) the predisposing management or ventilation problems have not been corrected; and (3) lungworms should be ruled out.",

It is occasionally identifi ed as the cause of herd outbreaks of pneumonia in dairy cattle or calves in the northeastern United States. H. somni may be the only pathogen isolated or may be found in conjunction with Mycoplasma spp. or Pasteurella pneumonia in cattle. Although H. somni occasionally is isolated from the upper airway of normal cattle, this gram-negative organism is more commonly isolated in clinical pneumonia patients. A shift in the normal upper airway bacterial fl ora or stress activation of latent H. somni in the upper airway may contribute to lower airway infection. The pathogenicity of H. somni and Pasteurella organisms is attributed to several characteristics: (1) an endotoxin derived from the cell wall lipopolysaccharides, (2) exotoxins that are lethal or damaging to alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and vascular endothelium, and (3) chemotactic factors and possible hemolysins common to H. somni and other bacteria that act as infl ammatory mediators. Vasculitis is a predominant feature of H. somni pathology. H. somni-stimulated platelets have also been shown to contribute to endothelial cell damage, which may play a role in pathogenesis of the vasculitis and thrombosis. In addition, H. somni has a propensity to cause disease in the heart muscle and sometimes the central nervous system.",

A. pyogenes is a gram-positive coccobacillus that acts as a ubiquitous opportunist capable of establishing chronic pyogenic infections virtually anywhere in the cow's body. In the lung, it is a secondary invader that usually only establishes infection following suppression of host physical, cellular, or secretory defense mechanisms. Physical factors such as inhalation pneumonia also may allow A. pyogenes to infect the lung, and viral, bacterial, or Mycoplasma agents may precede infection with A. pyogenes. Immunosuppression caused by acute or persistent infection with BVDV has been followed by A. pyogenes pneumonia in calves and adult cows. Similarly, calves affected with bovine leukocyte adhesion defi ciency (BLAD) frequently suffered A. pyogenes pneumonia. Pulmonary infection is aided by the proteases and hemolysins that the organism produces. These factors contribute to tissue necrosis and infl ammatory events that perpetuate the organism's existence. Fusobacterium and other pathogenic anaerobic organisms may be found concurrently with A. pyogenes, P. multocida, and Mycoplasma spp. Signs are indicative of chronic or recurrent infection, the hallmark of A. pyogenes pneumonia. The history usually indicates illness of at least 1 week's duration or recurrent episodes of pneumonia over weeks to months. There may only be one (usually adult cattle) or a few animals (usually calves) affected out of a group or herd. In adult dairy cattle, it is common for clinical signs to develop following freshening (Figure 4-24) . In some cases, there may be severe subcutaneous emphysema over the dorsum, suggesting a rupture of diseased alveoli associated with calving as a cause of the pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, and sometimes pneumo thorax. Although this should be considered in cattle with dorsal emphysema following calving, similar emphysema may be found sometimes in apparently healthy cattle following calving and of course in cattle with interstitial pneumonia. Affected animals may show low-grade fever (103.0 to 105.0\u00b0 F/39.44 to 40.56\u00b0 C), rapid respiratory rate (40 to 100 breaths/min), dyspnea characterized by exaggerated inspiratory and especially expiratory efforts (particularly when stressed), head and neck extension when lying down, cough, nasal discharge ( Figure 4-25) , rough hair coat, poor body condition, depression, inappetence, or decreased milk production. Some cattle maintain normal respiratory rates but exhibit the other signs. Chronic suppurative pneumonia should always be considered a differential for the \"poor doing\" cow. Auscultation of the lungs reveals moist and dry rales in the ventral 25% to 50% of both lungs in calves and one or both lungs in adult cattle, bronchial tones indicative of consolidation in the ventral lung fi elds, and coarse tracheal rales caused by a thick mucopurulent airway exudate.

Penicillin is the drug of choice and should be given at 22,000 U/kg twice daily for 7 to 30 days. Although penicillin is effective against A. pyogenes in vitro, the pulmonary in vivo infection should be likened to an abscess because of the heavy accumulation of A. pyogenes pus in areas of bronchiectasis or encapsulated lung abscesses. If another pathogen, in addition to A. pyogenes, is isolated from the tracheal wash sample, appropriate antibiotic therapy should be selected for this organism as well. Ceftiofur, ampicillin, and tetracyclines are other commonly used therapies. Clinical treatment frequently results in short-term improvement followed by relapse when the animal is stressed or subjected to high environmental temperatures, humidity, or poor ventilation. Signs of improvement will be indicated by normal rectal temperature, improved respiratory function, and improvement in overall body condition and attitude. Many affected animals eventually succumb to the infection or are culled because of poor condition and production. This pneumonia is characterized by peribronchiolar and peribronchial lymphoid hyperplasia and purulent bronchiolitis. Lesions usually are limited to the anterior ventral tips of the lung lobes, and the associated clinical signs are mild. Gross inspection at necropsy reveals ventral areas of lung lobes that are redblue and fi rm, appear almost as atelectatic areas, and ooze purulent material from the airways on cut sections. Mycoplasma pneumonia has been described as a \"cuffi ng pneumonia\" because lymphoid hyperplasia appears around the airways and expands with time. Mycoplasma organisms have several properties that contribute to their pathogenicity, including inhibition of the mucociliary transport mechanism (at least in humans); they cause some degree of humoral and cell-mediated immunosuppression in calves; and they avoid phagocytosis by attaching to ciliated epithelium above the level of alveolar macrophages. At our clinic, Mycoplasma frequently is isolated from acute and chronic calf pneumonia outbreaks and may be involved in up to 50% of chronic calf pneumonia endemics that we investigate. However, Mycoplasma sp. seldom is the only pathogen isolated in these outbreaks, and H. somni, P. multocida, and M. haemolytica usually are isolated as well. Because Mycoplasma appears ubiquitous on many farms, we wonder whether the Mycoplasma infection has been present in the calves' lungs for a long time and contributes to impaired host defense against bacterial and viral pathogens or whether the Mycoplasma infection is acute along with the other pathogens. In herds with Mycoplasma pneumonia, Mycoplasma frequently can be isolated from almost all adult cows and calves-most of which appear healthy. Therefore the ubiquitous nature of the organism makes it nearly impossible for calves on these farms not to be infected. The subsequent low grade pneumonia and defense mechanism compromise caused by the Mycoplasma infection may precede the onset of clinical pneumonia caused by bacterial and viral pathogens. How signifi cant Mycoplasma sp. is to the entire problem is diffi cult to determine, but we believe it increases the risk of calfhood pneumonia. In addition to pneumonia, M. bovis may also cause otitis media, mastitis, and arthritis once it becomes established in a herd. Some of the spread is likely from feeding infected milk. Effective control measures for Mycoplasma when it is ubiquitous on a premise are challenging and made more so because effective vaccines are not available. In endemic herds, the feeding of waste milk is a known risk factor for transmission of the organism to calves, and this practice should be actively discouraged. Pasteurization will remove the risk of Mycoplasma spread by this means but only makes economic sense on larger dairies or heifer-rearing operations.",

Infection may assume many forms in cattle, including respiratory, conjunctival, or infectious pustular vulvovaginitis affecting the caudal reproductive tract, infectious balanoposthitis of the male external genitalia, endemic abortions, and the neonatal septicemic form characterized by encephalitis and focal plaque necrosis of the tongue. Bovine herpesvirus 5 (BoHV5) may also cause outbreaks of encephalitis in young stock. The respiratory form of BHV1 is the most common and may occur alone or coupled with the conjunctival form. DNA variants of BHV1 initially described correlated to specifi c system disease, but recent genomic mapping has found no basis for these divisions. Abortions may occur in association with any of the forms of the disease, either during the acute disease or in the ensuing weeks following an endemic. Each infected herd seems to have one predominant clinical form of the disease, but occasional animals may also show signs of other forms during an endemic. Recent work suggests that genetic factors may play a role in the relative resistance of cattle to IBR virus and that this resistance may be mediated by type 1 interferon genotypes. Like many other herpes viruses, IBR virus is capable of recrudescence when previously infected cattle harboring latent virus infection are stressed by infectious diseases, shipment, or corticosteroids. Immunity from natural infection or vaccination is short lived and probably does not exceed 6 to 12 months. Respiratory disease caused by IBR is associated with high morbidity but low mortality in susceptible animals. Fatalities seldom result from primary or recurrent IBR infections unless secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia, especially M. haemolytica, or concurrent viral infection with BVDV or BRSV occurs. (These viruses are discussed further in this section.) The IBR virus compromises the physical and cellular components of the lower airway defense mechanism by damaging mucociliary transport and the mucus layer and directly infecting alveolar macrophages. Therefore com bination infections may result in high mortality because of multiple compromises of the lower airway host defense and possible immunosuppression-especially with concurrent BVDV infection. As stated previously, BHV1 infection up-regulates genes that activate receptors for the leukotoxin of M. haemolytica and contribute to the severity of that disease.",

            "text": "Etiology and Signs. BRSV has become one of the most important respiratory pathogens in dairy calves and adult cattle in the past 20 years. The virus certainly may have been present for much longer, but new diagnostic procedures, increased technology in virology, and recognition of the virus and its pathophysiology have heightened awareness of this disease. The virus is a pneumovirus within the paramyxovirus family and is distinctly different from the bovine syncytial virus (BSV), which is a spumavirus in the retrovirus family. There is no current evidence that the BSV is a pathogen in cattle. Respiratory disease caused by BRSV was fi rst reported in Europe during the 1970s and has been recognized throughout the United States in the 1980s in endemic form in beef and dairy cattle. Experimental and natural diseases have been reported, and it is now accepted that BRSV is likely the cause of many poorly defi ned epidemics heretofore diagnosed as \"atypical interstitial pneumonia\" in calves and cattle. It also is likely that BRSV infection has proceeded, and predisposed cattle to, severe bacterial bronchopneumonia but gone undiagnosed because of overwhelming bacterial lesions. The virus produces a humoral antibody response, which is helpful both for diagnosis and epidemiological surveys. Based on surveys completed in several regions of the United States, BRSV infection appears common in cattle because 50% or more of cattle surveyed have titers to BRSV. The virus has caused sporadic clinical disease in dairy cattle and calves and probably has gone undiagnosed frequently. Outbreaks of BRSV may be limited to calves, affect only adult cows, or can involve all animals in a herd. Morbidity is high, but mortality as a result of BRSV infection is much lower unless secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia ensues. The virus apparently does not infect alveolar macrophages but may damage physical defense mechanisms of the lower airway, such as mucociliary transport, and may lead to antigen-antibody complexes that subsequently engage complement and result in damage to the lower airway. Although experimental reproduction of the clinical disease has not been consistently successful in challenge studies, there have been recent studies that help explain the pathogenesis of the disease further. Two-to 6-month-old calves have been successfully infected and have marked production of infl ammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 6, and interferon); these are thought to help promote viral clearance but may have a pathogenic role in causing airway obstruction. Previous work suggests that BRSV alters macrophage function suffi ciently to short cycle and depress responsiveness of lymphocytes. In any event, interstitial pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, airway obstruction, and pneumothorax are very common following BRSV infection. Many unexplained facets of BRSV infection persist despite the proliferation of research on the virus. For example, BRSV infection often arises in herds that appear to have excellent management and have not purchased new cattle, shipped and returned existing cattle, or stressed animals in any apparent way. Where did the infection come from in these herds? Was it latent in a recovered animal, or was it introduced by regular visitors to the farm? Cattle are thought to be the reservoir, but it has not yet been shown how or why the virus activates, replicates, and spreads to cause all clinical epidemics.",

Clinical signs include high fever (104.0 to 108.0\u00b0 F/40.0 to 42.22\u00b0 C); depression, anorexia, and decreased milk production; salivation and serous or mucoid nasal discharge; degree of dyspnea varies from simple increased respiratory rate (40 to 100 breaths/min) to open mouth breathing; and in all but the most mild outbreaks, a percentage of the affected cattle will have subcutaneous emphysema palpable under the skin of the dorsum, especially near the withers (Figure 4-33) . Auscultation of the lungs in acute cases may reveal a wide range of sounds. Increased bronchovesicular sounds, bronchial tones, fi ne crepitation caused by emphysema, and rales (usually as a result of secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia) have been described. In New York, practitioners have found the lungs may auscult as diffusely very quiet or almost inaudible in acutely affected cattle in some outbreaks. This has been a very important sign and initially appears in contrast to the outward signs of dyspnea displayed by these cattle. However, the relative deficit of airway sounds fi ts the existing pathology because pneumothorax and/or diffuse interstitial edema and emphysema compress the small airways and cause the lungs to be quieter than one would expect (Figures 4-34 , A to C, and 4-35). This is the same phenomenon that occurs in proliferative pneumonia in which the alveoli and small airways are obliterated or reduced in size. If secondary bacterial pneumonia occurs, bronchial tones or rales are heard in the anterior ventral lung region, and the dorsal and caudal lungs become quieter because of mechanical overwork, increasing the degree of edema and emphysema. Dyspnea will be severe in such cases, and affected animals usually show open mouth breathing and an audible grunt or groan with each expiration. This dyspnea is more obvious if affected animals are stressed by handling or being made to move. Despite the high fevers and respiratory distress, affected cattle frequently do not look septic (e.g., severe depression, scleral injection) as with acute overwhelming bacterial pneumonia.",

The signs of BRSV infection in calves or cattle may be suggestive of the diagnosis, especially when acute onset, high fever, and subcutaneous emphysema are found in several affected animals. These signs are rarely seen in calves younger than 6 weeks, but calves aged 2 to 6 months seem to be most commonly affected. Auscultation of the lungs in acute cases may be helpful if the lungs sound diffusely quiet despite obvious severe dyspnea. The veterinarian must be cautious in diagnosing BRSV based only on the fi nding of subcutaneous emphysema or pneumothorax in some animals. Any severe pneumonia (especially other interstitial pneumonias or severe consolidating bronchopneumonia) can also cause subcutaneous emphysema because the only remaining normal lung tissue (dorsal or caudal lung fi elds) is overworked to the point at which emphysema and interstitial edema are likely. Therefore subcutaneous emphysema may be suggestive of but not pathognomonic for BRSV. As with most of the diseases discussed thus far, laboratory confi rmation is the only defi nitive means to confi rm a diagnosis of BRSV. Viral cultures from tracheal wash fl uid or necropsy specimens are indicated but often are not rewarding because BRSV is quickly cleared from the respiratory tract or a rapidly developing secretory antibody neutralizes the virus within the respiratory tract. The best results are from viral cultures or FA testing taken in the very early stages of the disease and quickly transported unfrozen to a diagnostic laboratory equipped with appropriate cell cultures. FA techniques may be used for tracheal wash samples, nasopharyngeal smears, and necropsy specimens of infected lung. Serology is helpful in establishing a diagnosis of BRSV because a marked humoral antibody titer occurs in response to the infection. Baker and Frey emphasize that antibody titers may increase early after acute infection and often peak before 2 weeks postinfection. Therefore collection of serum on day 1 and day 14 is very important when evaluating seroconversion. The same authors state that young calves may have titers derived from colostrum. These titers, indicative of passive immunity, are not protective against BRSV infection. Thus older calves, heifers, or adult animals are better populations to sample. Necropsy specimens may be very helpful in establishing a diagnosis. This is especially true if death has been acute and secondary bacterial pneumonia has not yet developed to somewhat mask the pulmonary lesions caused by BRSV.",

In this instance, typical BRSV lesions of emphysema, edema, and scattered palpably fi rm areas will be found in the lung caudal and dorsal to the consolidated areas. Several times at our clinic, we have obtained Pasteurella or Mannheimia isolates from tracheal wash specimens in BRSV outbreaks before BRSV was confi rmed by the diagnostic laboratory. Cattle in these herd outbreaks failed to respond, or responded unusually slowly, when placed on antibiotics chosen for their specifi c Pasteurella/ Mannhei mia isolate. This poor clinical response is a signal that another pathogen is contributing to the herd problem. Subsequent laboratory procedures may identify the causative virus, but viral cultures often lag behind bacterial culture and sensitivities. Despite the clinical frustrations and economic consequences, the veterinarian must show reasonable patience when requesting confi rmation of viral diseases. It is best to make personal contact with the laboratory, explain the seriousness of the outbreak, provide appropriate samples, and ascertain the appropriate time required for viral isolation, FA techniques, or titers.",

The disease will be discussed fully in Chapter 6. However, BVDV has been incriminated as a \"respiratory virus\" in cattle, and certain strains certainly can be isolated from the lower airway and alveolar macrophages of infected cattle. Some BVDV strains (genotypes 1a and 1b and biotype noncytopathogenic) are more commonly found in the lungs of cattle and are frequently associated with respiratory disease outbreaks. All strains of BVDV are immunosuppressive and predispose infected cattle to bacterial or other viral pneumonia. Naive cattle exposed to type 2 strain may develop severe interstitial pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow necrosis, diarrhea, and acute death sometimes without having mucosal erosions. Additionally, a persistently infected calf or cow may suddenly develop bacterial pneumonia without other predisposing factors, and this scenario should always be considered as a possible reason for a single case of bacterial pneumonia in a herd. During acute BVDV infection, high fevers occur in affected cattle early in the course of the disease. These cattle may show no other signs-no diarrhea, no mucosal lesions-and merely appear depressed and febrile at 106.0 to 108.0\u00b0 F (41.11 to 42.22\u00b0 C). Because the high fever necessitates increased physiologic heat loss, some cows have mild increases in their respiratory rate (40 to 60 breaths/min), but the lungs are normal on auscultation or may have slightly increased bronchovesicular sounds. These cattle are merely in the early stages of acute BVDV infection, and unless a superimposed bacterial infection develops, clinical pneumonia may not occur. If the animal seroconverts and responds to the BVDV in a normal fashion, no other signs may develop. Some cattle will progress from this early stage of fever with no other signs to blatant mucosal lesions and diarrhea 7 to 14 days following the original onset of fever. This situation has been observed in natural outbreaks and with experimental BVDV infection with certain strains of BVDV in naive cattle. Most cattle with BVDV have mild pulmonary lesions or normal lungs grossly and histologically unless an opportunistic bacterial pneumonia has developed. Naive cattle infected with the type 2 strain may die with severe interstitial pneumonia.",

Research documents the negative effects that BVDV infection has on neutrophil, macrophage, and lymphocyte function. Humoral and cell-mediated lymphocyte functions are depressed during acute BVDV infection. Leukopenia in the peripheral blood is a well-known feature of acute BVDV infection in cattle. Although naive or susceptible cattle fully recover immune function following the development of adequate humoral antibody against BVDV, they are very susceptible to secondary infection during the acute BVDV infection and associated immunosuppression. Alveolar macrophages are frequently infected with BVDV, which would be expected to have a direct negative effect on lung protection against invading bacteria. Therefore the results are devastating if a cow or group of cows acutely infected with BVDV has the bad fortune to become infected with P. multocida, M. haemolytica, or H. somni pneumonia at the same time. Bacterial bronchopneumonia may progress rapidly because host defense mechanisms are negligible. In addition, cattle may die so quickly from severe pneumonia that necropsy identifi es bacterial pneumonia as the cause of death.

Calves should be removed from the dam and calving pen as quickly as possible, aided in drying, and fed 4 quarts of colostrum before being moved to the hutch or calf barn. When the environment is managed in this way, most bacterial and viral pneumonias will be prevented, primarily by ensuring good ventilation that dilutes potential pathogens. Mycoplasma may be a herd problem even with good environmental management. Feeding of contaminated colostrum or waste milk is thought to be the primary means of transmitting Mycoplasma to young calves. Aerosol spread may subsequently occur to calves housed with or very near infected calves. Use of colostrum replacer, milk replacer, and pasteurization of waste milk are all alternatives to prevent exposure of young calves. Recent studies of heat-treating colostrum have shown that heating to less than pasteurization temperatures is very effective in killing important calf pathogens without damaging the immunoglobulins. Heating to 140\u00b0 F (60\u00b0 C) for 30 minutes eliminates M. bovis from colostrum.

Exhaled bacteria and viruses are included in microscopic droplets of moisture. Prevention of respiratory infections in these settings requires improvement in the ventilation to dilute the pathogens and remove the irritants. There is a wealth of information on techniques for designing or retrofi tting appropriate ventilation systems available from agricultural engineers through the extension services of each state. If the walls or ceiling accumulate condensation or the odor of ammonia in the barn is noticeable, there is inadequate ventilation.

All modern free stall barns in cold climates are now curtain-sided and can be adjusted according to weather conditions in the winter to allow adequate fresh air entry for removal of humidity and ammonia.

Prevention consists both of effective vaccination programs and management designed to reduce the probability of infectious respiratory disease. Currently, effective vaccines are available for IBR, PI 3 , and BVDV. Vaccines against H. somni and P. multocida, although available, have not been proven to be of any benefi t. Newer vaccines against M. haemolytica that are based on leukotoxins of this bacterium have been proven benefi cial in reducing morbidity and mortality in feedlot cattle. No comparable data have been published for dairy cattle, but by extension a benefi t is probable if mannheimiosis were to occur. Vaccination strategies for herds should be individually determined and include the assessment of risk for all age groups. Closed herds in isolated settings have a much lower risk of contagious pathogens than herds that continuously purchase animals or exhibit cattle. Regardless, primary immunization requires two doses of vaccine and is best done at an early age. Optimal response to vaccines occurs after the waning of colostrally derived antibodies. Thus current recommendations are to begin the primary series at about 3 months of age with the second dose administered 2 to 4 weeks later. Recent research indicates the greatest response to immunization against IBR and BVDV occurs if the fi rst two doses are a killed product and the subsequent booster is a modifi ed live vaccine. All major vaccine producers offer combination products with options of killed virus or modifi ed live virus that provide the four viral components in a single injection. The M. haemolytica leukotoxoids are usually a distinct product. Subsequent boosters are administered at frequencies that correspond to the perceived risk and usually at times or ages that offer some convenience to management. The duration of immunity following proper vaccination is mostly not known for each of the components of the routinely used products. Thus recommendations for low-risk herds may be annual revaccination of the entire herd, whereas high-risk herds may be given boosters two or three times per year. Alternatively, in many large herds adults are vaccinated in conjunction with the lactation cycle. For example, a modifi ed live booster is given at 30 days in milk, and killed boosters are given at 120 and 240 days of gestation.",

Another widely used strategy for undifferentiated respiratory disease of recently weaned calves is metaphylaxis of the at-risk group. Current practice in many dairies is to wean a group of calves and move them within 1 week or so to group housing. This change, particularly when more than 10 calves in a group are moved at one time, seems to be a trigger for respiratory disease. Control has been achieved in many herds with mass medication at the time of a move with a single injection of a long-acting antibiotic such as oxytetracycline, tilmicosin, tulathromycin, or fl orfenicol or by feeding chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine pellets for 5 to 7 days.

Adult lungworms reside in the trachea and bronchi. Eggs produced by female adults hatch either in the trachea or before being passed in the feces. The progression to the infective third stage larvae requires only 5 days, and the larvae are then ingested during consumption of contaminated grass in a pasture or bedding in heavily contaminated box stalls. Ingested larvae traverse the intestinal wall to reside in mesenteric lymph nodes, moult to the fourth stage, and within 1 week migrate to the lungs through lymphatics or blood vessels. The fi nal fi fth stage is reached after the larvae arrive in the bronchioles.

Fever (103.0 to 106.0\u00b0 F/39.44 to 41.11\u00b0 C) may be present in some cases, as opportunistic bacteria such as P. multocida invade the damaged lower airway and establish a secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia.

Although most cattle do not show signs of illness when the shower occurs, some cattle experience acute death from massive pulmonary infarction or have an acute onset of profound respiratory distress at the time of a thromboembolic episode. Those cattle that have inapparent seeding of the pulmonary arteries or survive an acute respiratory distress episode caused by thromboemboli may eventually develop dyspnea, hemoptysis, and anemia. Epistaxis is the most common clinical sign observed in those cows with hemoptysis. The pathogenesis of caudal vena caval thrombosis starts in the forestomach or abomasum and involves infl ammatory or ulcerative mucosal lesions that allow bacterial seeding of the portal circulation with subsequent formation of liver abscesses. Therefore rumenitis, ruminal acidosis, abomasal ulcers, and similar disorders predispose to the condition. This same pathogenesis is responsible for \"sawdust livers\" in feedlot beef animals, but in dairy cattle, the abscesses usually are larger and fewer in number. Many dairy cattle have only one abscess. The location is much more important than the number of abscesses, however, because only those at the hilus of the liver or adjacent to the post cava represent signifi cant risk (Figure 4-41) . F. necrophorum or A. pyogenes are the most common organisms isolated from liver abscesses in dairy cattle. Most cattle with liver abscesses show no clinical signs of illness unless an abscess erodes into the vena cava or multiple large abscesses develop.

Iatrogenic inhalation pneumonia in calves follows inadvertent intubation of the trachea with stomach tubes or esophageal feeders or, more commonly, from use of abnormally large holes on the end of nipple bottles. Nipple bottles used to feed calves should only drip milk when the bottle is turned upside down.

Sometimes inhalation of saliva or small amounts of water or feed as a result of dysphagia is treatable with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. We have had the best results with cattle that develop some degree of inhalation pneumonia secondary to dysphagia induced by pharyngeal trauma. Because the amount of inhaled material usually is unknown, treatment is indicated unless the animal shows profound dyspnea and cyanosis.",

Persistent fever, depression, dyspnea, and toxemia are negative signs and generally signal a fatal outcome. Prevention. Inhalation of certain necrotizing or nonabsorbable chemicals (e.g., mineral oil) is uniformly fatal, and treatment is not indicated. Prevention of inhalation pneumonia can be practiced only when the problem is anticipated and is largely a matter of common sense. Therefore withdrawing feed from animals suffering from choke, dysphagia, and other known problems may be helpful. Prompt treatment of milk fever or other diseases that may prevent a cow from maintaining sternal recumbency is important in preventing aspiration pneumonia. Management practices such as routine or therapeutic drenching of postparturient cattle should only be performed by laypeople who have been properly trained and provided with appropriate equipment. The feeding of milk to weak, premature, or dysmature calves should also be predicated on common sense and an awareness that normal protective airway refl exes may be overcome by impatient feeding practices (e.g., enlarging holes in nipples) or by allowing these calves to nurse with the head and neck hyperextended or dorsifl exed, as appears to be their instinctive habit. Feeding from buckets or a bottle with the head and neck in a neutral position parallel to the ground can lessen the risk of inhalation.",

Thermal damage resulting from excessive heat and smoke inhalation has been well described for comparative species.

If laryngeal edema is so severe as to result in respiratory distress, a tracheostomy may be necessary. A tracheostomy should not be performed unless severe upper respiratory distress is present because the procedure further predisposes to secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia in burn patients. Oxygen administration is indicated if acute dyspnea suggests possible carbon monoxide poisoning. Judicious dosages of furosemide (25 to 50 mg/45 kg body weight) may be necessary if pulmonary edema is present. Use of corticosteroids for acute pulmonary distress caused by thermal injury is controversial. Steroids have been proposed as initial therapy to \"short cycle\" parts of the vicious cycle of infl ammation because they decrease mediators of infl ammation, stabilize infl amed vasculature, and decrease edema of the upper and lower airway. If steroids are used, they should be given immediately rather than waiting for the subsequent pathology and respiratory distress that will follow thermal injury in the following 1 to 24 hours. Dosages vary but may be as high as 0.1 to 1.0 mg/lb dexamethasone as a one-time treatment. Abortifacient properties of the drug need to be considered before it is used on pregnant animals, and a signifi cant risk associated with the use of steroids in the form of possible secondary bronchopneumonia also must be considered before dexamethasone's use. Dr. Rebhun commented that he had treated some barn fi re victims with dexamethasone but that the results were hard to interpret. In one valuable yearling bull, a high dose of corticosteroids was used initially without respiratory consequences, but the bull developed a left displacement of the abomasum within 24 hours of treatment. The cause/effect relationship of the exogenous source of corticosteroids on the displacement never was confi rmed but certainly was suspicious. NSAIDs may be used at regular dosages without the additional risks presented by corticosteroids. However, NSAIDs probably do not block the ongoing pathophysiology of lower airway disease corticosteroids. Prophylactic systemic antibiotics are reported not to infl uence the subsequent development of bacterial bronchopneumonia. Some literature regarding usage in humans discourages the use of prophylactic antibiotics for fear of allowing resistant strains of bacteria to emerge in the lower airway. In cattle, es pecially valuable ones, broad-spectrum antibiotics us ually are used on a prophylactic basis, although no controlled data support their use. Tetracyclines may help decrease infl ammation via their inhibitory effect on metalloproteinases. Disadvantages of tetracyclines would be that they are bacteriostatic and many commensal organisms may be resistant to the drug. If used, practitioners should be aware of their potential to cause nephrotoxicity, particularly in hemodynamically challenged patients. If tracheostomies or tracheal washes are performed, extreme care should be taken to minimize iatrogenic introduction of pathogens into the respiratory tract. As in thermal skin injury, Pseudomonas sp. and other opportunists are the major bacteria to invade damaged tissue.",

Lactic acid indigestion (toxic rumenitis) remains one of the leading causes of mycotic pneumonia. Pathophysiology evolves from chemical rumenitis to bacterial rumenitis and subsequent mycotic rumenitis-especially if the affected cow has been treated with antibiotics. Embolic infection of the lungs ensues as a result of seeding of the portal circulation and liver from the primary ruminal infection.

Pneumomediastinum is most common in postpartum cows.

Signs may be mild or impossible to separate from those caused by the primary pulmonary pathology. Mild dyspnea, subcutaneous emphysema, and bilateral muffl ed heart sounds are present in most instances.

Calves should develop a fairly normal respiratory pattern within the fi rst hour after life, whereas newborn calves with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) will have labored breathing that does not improve with time. There may be other signs of prematurity (e.g., small size, abnormally fi ne hair coat) in premature calves. Cloned calves may also have abnormally large umbilical vessels. Lung sounds are diffusely harsh and generally do not have rales. The heart rate will be high, but loud murmurs are usually absent unless the respiratory distress is caused by a congenital heart defect. An arterial sample ",

In some cases, the CO 2 will be elevated, and this can be confi rmed by a venous sample (\u03fe45 mm Hg). If the CO 2 is elevated in a rapidly breathing calf, the PaO 2 will be extremely low. Pulse oximetry is useful in calves to confi rm the hypoxemia and for monitoring therapy. A chest radiograph will reveal diffuse underinfl ation of the lung and parenchymal collapse. Some premature calves will have moderate to severe respiratory acidosis, hypercapnia, and hypoxemia but because of inappropriate/underdeveloped central responses will appear eupneic or only slightly tachypneic. Periodic assessment of preferably arterial blood gases, or at the very least venous blood pH and CO 2 tension, in the fi rst day or two of life in premature calves is therefore recommended. Treatment. Treatment must be early and vigorous if there is hope for survival. Vitamin E and selenium should be given IM. Intranasal oxygen must be administered and the calf given prophylactic antibiotics. One dose of corticosteroid (10 mg of dexamethasone) is often given and empirically does seem to help, especially following meconium aspiration. Although it is proven that corticosteroids given to cattle in the last 2 weeks of gestation improve lung function at birth in cesarean-derived calves, there is limited proof that postnatal-administered steroids will similarly accelerate lung maturation. It may be that postnatal-administered steroids, if they help at all, are inhibiting oxidative lung damage in the hypoxic calf. If surfactant is available, it should be given to the calf via intratracheal instillation via a tube, less commonly by direct injection, or it can be nebulized. Commercially prepared surfactant is preferred, but we have collected surfactant from healthy donor cows by bronchoalveolar lavage using 100 ml of sterile saline and then using the top (foamy) part of the collection for intratracheal administration or nebulization. We have also nebulized the affected calves with acetylcysteine while they were being administered an aminophylline drip. The aminophylline not only serves as a bronchodilator but also has antiinfl ammatory properties and helps maintain diaphragm strength. Fluids (crystalloids and colloids such as plasma) may be given IV as a continuous drip if needed. We have also administered thyrotropin releasing factor and/or thyroxin in hopes of increasing surfactant production. If pulmonary gas exchange cannot be suffi ciently improved with the above and the owners request further treatment, the calf can be placed on a mechanical ventilator, but this is expensive. It is sometimes more diffi cult to keep calves quiet on a ventilator as compared with foals. Cloned calves with ascites and enlarged umbilical vessels seldom survive even when placed on the ventilator. Persistent pulmonary hypertension causes progression of right heart failure and sometimes reversion to fetal circulation patterns. Nitric oxide (ratio NO to oxygen \u03ed 1:9) can be administered through the oxygen line in hopes of decreasing the pulmonary hypertension (Figure 4-55) . The chronic hypoxia results in acidosis and multiple organ failure.",

NO 2 , a heavy yellow gas produced by anaerobic fermentation of fresh silage, may cause the same lower airway damage in cattle exposed to fumes as in humans. Because the gas is heavier than air, it lies on top of recently ensiled material-especially corn silage-and seeks out lower locations such as silo chutes. The major risk to farmers occurs when workers enter a silo chute or silo without fi rst starting the blower in the silo loader to \"wash out\" NO 2 . Cattle confi ned next to the silo chute are most at risk and may receive chronic low exposure toxicity or severe acute toxicity. Gaseous NO 2 seeks water that allows it to convert to nitric acid, which damages tissues. In the respiratory tract, nitric acid causes acute injury similar to anhydrous ammonia and subsequent obliterative bronchiolitis and interstitial fi brosis.",

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis may occur in cattle and result in respiratory distress or chronic respiratory disease. In humans, many specifi c inhalant antigens may cause similar symptoms, but frequently Micropolyspora faeni and related organisms are incriminated. Wet hay that ferments excessively remains the biggest cause of this condition in farmers and cattle. The resultant dusty, moldy hay releases tremendous numbers of spores when bales are opened into the face of humans and animals. Large round bales also have been observed to cause the problem occasionally. A delayed hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. Signs of acute experimental exposure include a sudden decrease in appetite and milk production, coughing, cranioventral pulmonary rales bilaterally, and transient fever. In natural cases, chronic cough without obvious illness remains the most common sign when this disease has been recognized in the northeastern United States. Usually more than 50% of the herd is affected, and herd production decreases 10% to 25% because affected cattle cough enough to interfere with normal consumption of feed. Auscultation of the lungs may reveal a few wheezes or may be normal. Signs lessen but do not stop entirely when animals are fed outdoors or go to pasture. Confi nement and feeding the causative hay indoors accentuate the signs. Mortality is rare, but occasionally severe chronic cases have developed right heart failure. With the feeding of total mixed rations and the reduction in lifespan of dairy cattle in the United States, this disease has become less common. However, sporadic cases continue to be seen, not so much as a herd issue, but as an individual, older multiparous cow problem on traditional stanchion and tie stall farms.",

If economics allow, getting rid of the hay is the best policy and may solve the problem.
