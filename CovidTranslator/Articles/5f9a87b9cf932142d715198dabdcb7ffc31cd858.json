This study used SARIMAX/(E)GARCH volatility models to forecast visitor arrivals by air transport to New Zealand from its eight key tourist source markets the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US)) and control macroeconomic factors together with global and regional structural changes. The empirical models reveal that the macroeconomic factors contributed at various levels to different markets, and the models we provided made accurate and reliable forecasts for visitor arrivals by air transport from all studied markets. The results from the markets for Germany, Japan, South Korea and the UK showed that significantly negative tourism demand shocks increased the volatility of tourism arrivals, more than positive tourism demand shocks of equal magnitude. Accordingly, the findings of this study will allow policy-makers in the New Zealand tourism sector and other stakeholders (e.g. airline management) to better understand the impacts on the volatility of visitor arrivals to New Zealand.",

            "text": "International tourism is one of the key drivers for boosting New Zealand's aviation industry as well as its economy via generation of goods and services, attracting foreign currency and stimulating tourismrelated employment and investment. According to Statistics New Zealand, New Zealand's tourism sector grew from 1.16 million visitors in 1993 to 2.86 million in 2014, equalling a growth rate of 146.97% during this period. Importantly, the unique location of New Zealand (an island country) makes air transport the most convenient way to visit New Zealand. An average of 98.97% of visitor arrivals using air transport visited New Zealand during this period. As of 2014, direct tourism value added 2.3% towards New Zealand's gross domestic product (GDP) and international tourism expenditure in New Zealand was approximately NZ$9567 million (Statistics New Zealand, 2015) . Therefore, in the New Zealand context, a substantial body of literature has discussed the international tourism demand (e.g. Balli and Tsui, 2015; Becken and Gnoth, 2004; Chan et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2011a Chang et al., , 2011b Turner and Witt, 2001; Yeoman et al., 2012) .",

Recent studies (e.g. Chang et al., 2011a Chang et al., , 2011b Coshall, 2009; Divino and McAleer, 2010; Kim and Wong, 2006; McAleer, 2005, 2007) have shown that volatility modelling has been undertaken by researchers for different countries. From strategic management and planning perspective for the tourism sector, it is important to have accurate and reliable forecasts and estimations of the volatility of visitor arrivals from New Zealand's key tourist source markets. The foremost important reason is that the patterns of volatility have significant impact on reliable forecasts. Such forecasts can create the forecast bounds (upper and lower bounds) needed to evaluate the impacts of severe shocks and risks on New Zealand's international inbound tourism demand. Indeed, the volatility forecasts and the analysis of determinants is important for New Zealand's tourism and airline industries and other stakeholders. Volatility of tourist arrivals to New Zealand experienced by these tourismdependent industries has significant implications for capital investment, resource and yield management. The forecasts might be used by stakeholders to utilise these resources more efficiently.",

Reliable forecasts would eventually increase the quality of the service that international tourists to New Zealand will obtain. It should be noted that the tourism sector in New Zealand has become the largest export earner in terms of foreign exchange earnings in 2016 (Tourism New Zealand, 2016) . Therefore, it is necessary for the New Zealand government and tourism-related industries to realise whether there will be any fluctuations in tourism demand from its key tourist source markets in response to any specific shocks. Well-planned tourism policies and initiatives may enhance the competitiveness of New Zealand as one of the popular tourist destinations for international tourists (particularly the booming Chinese outbound market). These aims may be achieved through the provision of higher quality tourismrelated services and products as well as facilities, and thus the level of customer satisfaction can be improved for tourists visiting New Zealand. Importantly, these initiatives will benefit the future growth of New Zealand's tourism sector and economy.",

            "text": "Having said that, it is also important to determine the volatility of visitor arrivals to New Zealand but only a few prior tourism studies have explored the impacts of the volatility of visitor arrivals to New Zealand Chan et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2011a; 2011b) . To the best knowledge of authors, this study will be the first empirical study to utilise a combination of the Box-Jenkins seasonal (S), autoregressive (AR), integrated (I), moving average (MA), alongside the identified factors and/or interventions (x ) (SARIMAX) methodology and the (exponential) general autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity ((E)GARCH) model to forecast visitor arrivals for a small country (tourism-oriented country) from its eight key tourist source markets and investigate how volatility affects visitor arrivals. From a theoretical perspective, there are two primary reasons that make the SARIMAX methodology and the (E)GARCH volatility model suitable for forecasting and modelling the volatility of New Zealand's international tourist arrivals in this study. First, the SARIMAX model is a times series model that has demonstrated its strengths in accurately forecasting the tourism demand of different countries in recent tourism literature (Baldigara and Mamula, 2015; Alsumair and Tsui, 2017) , and adding time series terms to a causal model is likely to improve its forecasting ability (Morley, 2009) . Second, the GARCH methodology has been applied in the tourism literature to model the volatility of tourism demand (e.g. Balli and Tsui, 2015; Chan et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2011a; 2011b; Shareef and McAleer, 2007; Song and Li, 2008) . The empirical models of this study have revealed that the macroeconomic factors contributed at various levels to different markets, and the models we provided made fairly accurate forecasts for the visitors originating from the selected markets. The volatility modelling results show that negative tourism demand shocks significantly increased the volatility of New Zealand's tourism demand, larger than positive tourism demand shocks of equal magnitude for some of the destination markets, namely Germany, Japan, South Korea and the UK. The study results pinpoint the factors that affect visitor arrivals to New Zealand and assist policy-makers (e.g. Tourism New Zealand and tourism-related operators) to realise the problems of tourism policy generation for New Zealand's tourist source markets while considering their inherent differences.",

In relation to tourism demand modelling, numerous studies (e.g. Goh and Law, 2011; Lim, 1997; Peng et al., 2014; Song and Li, 2008; Witt and Witt, 1995) have offered structured reviews of the forecasting methodologies used to forecast tourism demand. In particular, Song and Li (2008) reviewed the most popular times series and econometric models (e.g. the simple na\u00efve models, ARIMA-based methods, GARCH-based models and the vector error correction model -(VECM)) as well as a number of new quantitative and qualitative techniques (e.g. the almost ideal demand system (AIDS), artificial intelligence (AI) methods and artificial neural networks (ANN)) for tourism forecasting. They suggested that there is no single forecasting model that can consistently outperform other forecasting models in all situations. Similarly, Peng et al. (2014) also mentioned that no agreement has been reached regarding the superiority and advantages of different forecasting models.",

Baldigara and Mamula (2015) also used the Box-Jenkins SARIMAX model to forecast German tourism demand in Croatia and identified the determinants affecting the number of tourist arrivals. In addition, Tsui and Balli (2015) used the Box-Jenkins SARIMAX model to forecast and predict air passenger throughput for Hong Kong International Airport. Recently, Alsumair and Tsui (2017) also used the Box-Jenkins SARIMAX models to model and forecast the international inbound tourism of Saudi Arabia.

However, Chang et al. (2011b) mentioned that the analysis of tourism volatility is still a relatively new approach within tourism research and literature.

            "text": "New Zealand's international inbound tourism is largely dependent on long-distance inbound markets (except for Australia) (Schiff and Becken, 2011) . Eight major tourist source markets (i.e. Australia, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, the UK and the US) for New Zealand's tourism sector took a share of 77.08% of the total inbound tourists by air transport in 2013 (Statistics New Zealand, 2015) . The key variable of interest in this study is the monthly visitor arrivals by air transport from New Zealand's eight major tourist source markets (see Table 1 ). Fig. 1 shows the deseasonalised monthly visitor arrivals by air transport from the eight major tourist source markets between January 1993 and December 2013. The time series of the monthly visitor arrivals by air transport for these eight tourist source markets exhibit different patterns, alongside the possibility of seasonal patterns. Regarding the volume of visitor arrivals by air transport to New Zealand, Australia (1,207,952), China (228,592), the UK (189,072), the US (187,504), Japan (74,160) and Germany (68,992) were the largest six tourist source markets for New Zealand's tourism industry during 2013. Visitor arrivals by air transport from the smallest markets (South Korea and Canada) were 50,832 and 45,776 during the same period. On average, the largest share of visitor arrivals by air transport originated from Australia (37.35%), followed by the UK (10.40%), the US (8.94%), Japan (6.48%), South Korea (3.92%), China (3.83%), Germany (2.77%) and Canada (1.91%) (see Table 2 ).",

The significant increase in Chinese visitor arrivals by air transport to New Zealand suggests China's increasingly significant role in aiding New Zealand's tourism development over recent years . During the analysis period, Australia was New Zealand's largest international tourism market, accounting for almost half of international visitors (approximately 37.5% of New Zealand's total international inbound visitors) (Tourism New Zealand, 2017). The positive growth rate of Australian tourists is largely caused by the close proximity of New Zealand and Australia (i.e. it is a short-haul inbound market), 1 and their close social/historical and economic ties (e.g. the Closer Economic Relationships Programme between New Zealand and Australia) (Chan et al., 2005; Schiff and Becken, 2011) . The growth rates of five other countries (Canada, Germany, South Korea, the UK and the US) presented modest increases of 0.26\u25000.39% throughout the study period. However, Japan showed a negative growth rate (\u22120.13%) in the monthly visitor arrivals by air transport to New Zealand during the analysis period (see Table 2 ). The key reasons that contributed to the declining number of visits by Japanese tourists to New Zealand were Japan's continued economic recession, the rise in strength in the New Zealand dollar against the Japanese Yen, and the aging Japanese population, alongside the preference of Japanese outbound tourists to visit short-haul (closer) and/or cheaper destinations in Asia over recent years Mak et al., 2005) . Note that only the monthly average growth rates of China (1.74%) and Australia's visitor arrivals (0.68%) by air transport were above the monthly average growth rate of New Zealand's total visitor arrivals by air transport (0.49%) 2 during the analysis period; the remaining key tourist source markets had figures below New Zealand's average growth rate (see Table 2 ).",

Two main reasons prompted this study to use this method: (1) a quick glance at the information in both Fig. 2 and Table 2 indicates that there are some strong non-seasonal patterns of the volatility in New Zealand's visitor arrivals by air from its major tourist source markets; (2) Columns 7-10 in Table 2 contain information about the autocorrelation of order one (Q(1)) and autocorrelation of order 12 (Q(12)) of the residual of the series from the AR(1) model along with the same order of autocorrelation of the squared residuals (Q 2 (1) & Q 2 (12)). For all the time series, the Q(1) and Q(12) statistics in Table 2 are highly significant, presenting strong evidence for the existence of autocorrelation in the logarithmic distribution of tourism demand. The Q 2 (1)) and Q 2 (12) statistics are also highly significant for tourism demand, suggesting the presence of strong second-moment dependencies (conditional heteroscedasticity) in the time series data. Again, all these significant values indicate strong evidence for autoregressive and conditional heteroscedasticity patterns within the time series data, and therefore our study uses the ARCH/GARCH models to model the volatility of visitor arrivals from New Zealand's eight key tourist source markets. However, starting with the na\u00efve volatility model (GARCH), because of stability and convergence problems within the volatility of some tourism time series data, this study has also used a more flexible version, namely the EGARCH volatility model.",

Equation (2) also allows t 2 to be based on past information. Prior studies (Bollerslev, 1986; Coshall, 2009 ) claimed that previous shortrun shocks are represented by the lag of the squared residuals (e t 2 ) obtained from the 'mean equation', and also by the previous long-term conditional variance t 2 , which can be obtained from the 'variance equation' in the GARCH volatility model. The generic GARCH (1,1) volatility model is often considered to be suitable for capturing the volatility in tourism time series data (Chen and Lian, 2005) . However, if the two stationary limitations cannot be satisfied (i.e. all of the ARCH and GARCH parameters are larger than zero, and the total of the ARCH and GARCH parameters should be less than or equal to 1) (Divino and McAleer, 2010; Kim and Wong, 2006) , the EGARCH volatility model can become another option for modelling the volatility of visitor arrivals by air transport to New Zealand from the eight tourist source markets, as it has no restrictions on the parameters of t 2 > 0, and it focuses on the positive and negative shocks asymmetrically (e.g. Bowden and Payne, 2008; Coshall, 2009; Divino and McAleer, 2010; Longmore and Robinson, 2004; McAleer et al., 2007; Nelson, 1991) .

The parameter for log t j 2 , , j indicates the degree of volatility persistence (Bowden and Payne, 2008; Nelson, 1991) . The EGARCH (1,1) volatility model is considered to fit well for the tourism time series dataset in this study.",

As mentioned in Section 4, the SARIMAX/(E)GARCH model has two components: the Box-Jenkins SARIMAX model and the (E)GARCH volatility model. In using the SARIMAX/(E)GARCH volatility model for modelling the monthly visitor arrivals by air transport from New Zealand's eight key tourist source markets, all of the time series for visitor arrivals by air transport need to be stationary. Fig. 2 shows that visitor arrivals by air transport from all tourist source markets are relatively volatile. Table 4 also shows the estimation results of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root tests and indicates that all the time series of visitor arrivals by air transport are non-stationary, except for South Korea. After we applied first-order differencing, all of the time series became stationary at above the 0.05 significance level. Furthermore, the estimation results of the Hylleberg, Engle, Granger and Yoo (HEGY) seasonal unit root tests are shown in Table 5 , which also verified that all of the time series are seasonally stationary. The SARIMAX models for New Zealand's key tourist source markets were determined by the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the lowest Schwarz information criterion (SIC) values. In addition, the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) diagnostic correlograms as well as the Ljung-Box Q-statistics proved that the residual series of all of the time series in the SARIMAX model have 'white noise' characteristics. Table 6 shows the estimation results of the SARIMAX/(E)GARCH volatility models for New Zealand's eight key tourist source markets. All the volatility models provided accurate and reliable forecasting performance with lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values. In particular, the MAPE values for all countries are below 3.61%, and thus the forecasting performance accuracy of the SARIMAX/(E)GARCH volatility models is considered to be highly accurate according to the criteria set by findings of Lewis (1982) . A primary interest of this study is to establish accurate forecasting models for modelling and forecasting the monthly visitor arrivals by air transport from New Zealand's eight key tourist source markets. The adjusted-R 2 (Adj-R 2 ) values are high for most tourist source markets, indicating a good fit; however, the lower Adj-R 2 value for China might suggest that other factors are driving and affecting Chinese visitor arrivals by air transport to New Zealand.",

With the motivation of accessing the best forecasting model, we have chosen the best fitting one that produced the least error. For Canada and Germany only, we have included the current level of GDP growth because the forecasting models produced much better results than otherwise. For the rest of the countries, we included the previous months' GDP growth level (the lagged level) with the motivation that increased GDP might create more opportunity to spend on travelling in the upcoming period. The findings for the growth in 'GDP per capita' variable presented mixed results: only Balli et al. Journal of Air Transport Management 75 (2019) 204-214 the growth of GDP per capita 1 month before for South Korea was found to have a positive significant impact on increasing South Korean visitor arrivals to New Zealand, but this was not found for other key tourist source markets. This empirical finding indicate that the growth of South Korean GDP per capita increased the volatility of the monthly visitor arrivals by air transport to New Zealand. This finding is consistent with the Hakim and Merkert (2016) who stated that there is a directional causality from the GDP to air passengers and air freight volumes. Indeed, the GDP growth in a domestic economy would enhance the international trade relationships so do the volume of airfreight and business travels increase. This directional relationship developed by Hakim and Merkert (2016) is observed only for the tourism flows from South Korea to New Zealand. Indeed, the stable economic growth of South Korea with its worldwide brands including Kia, Samsung, LG, Hyundai, might have brought significant level of international business partnerships to the rest of the world. Accordingly, business travels from South Korea to the rest of the world (including New Zealand) has increased as well. However, Australia's insignificant positive coefficient of the growth in 'GDP per capita' (i.e. one of the key economic variables affecting tourism demand) may stem from other factors beyond the macroeconomic determinants affecting Australia's monthly visitor arrivals to New Zealand such as the strong cultural connection, closer proximity and flying distances across the Tasman Sea, and the provision of budget travel by low-cost carriers (e.g. Virgin and Jetstar). Australia always contributes the largest share of New Zealand's visitor arrivals because of their strong shared ties (e.g. economy, culture and family), which stimulates the growth in visitor arrivals from Australia (Ryan and Birks, 2006; Tsui and Balli, 2015) .",

Only three countries (Australia, South Korea and the US) presented negative parameters for the change in the 'exchange rate' variable. The possible interpretation of this insignificant exchange rate factor would be that these countries are listed as the top tourist source markets of New Zealand and are relatively richer. The higher income factors and the inelastic tourism demand of New Zealand would overweigh some other factors that might be important for explaining New Zealand's inbound tourism demand.",

Furthermore, only China was reported to have a negative parameter for the 'SARS outbreak 2003' variable out of all of the tourist source markets. This empirical finding is in line with the fact that the SARS outbreak in 2003 originated from China but its significant negative impact on China's international outbound tourism to New Zealand was not found in the data. Interestingly, a significant positive 'SARS outbreak 2003' variable was also reported for Australia; logically, the number of Australian tourists visiting New Zealand should not be seriously and adversely affected by this epidemic happening in China and Hong Kong because of Australia and New Zealand's strong ties and proximity (see Fig. 1 ).

This empirical finding for the US shows that the volatility of tourism demand from the US has statistically significant parameters of i and i but the sum of these two coefficients is not close to 1, thus indicating the non-persistent volatility of US tourist arrivals.",

Four countries (China, Japan, South Korea and the UK) were reported to have statistically significant and positive size effect parameters ( ) i , indicating the significant positive impact of volatility on their respective visitor arrivals by air transport to New Zealand. The parameter values of i are between 0.308 (the UK) and 0.838 (China). In addition, a negative and statistically significant sign effect ( i ) was reported for four countries (Germany, Japan, South Korea and the UK), but the other three countries (Australia, Canada and China) were still reported to have insignificant negative coefficients for the sign effect. These empirical findings show that visitor arrivals by air transport from Germany, Japan, South Korea and the UK to New Zealand were affected by an asymmetric effect alongside the leverage effect, as the coefficients met the conditions of i \u2260 0 and i < 0, which suggest that negative tourism demand shocks increased volatility compared with positive tourism demand shocks of equal magnitudethe negative leverage effect (Kim and Wong, 2006) . More importantly, these empirical findings show evidence of asymmetry and are consistent with the study of Coshall (2009) , which indicated that the asymmetrical impact on visitor arrivals to a country is apparently caused by the susceptibility of tourism demand to exogenous shocks (i.e. tourism demand shocks). For the degree of volatility persistence ( j ), Australia and Canada were reported to have significant negative parameters and four counties (China, Germany, South Korea and the UK) were reported to have significant positive parameters. The parameter values are: \u22120.988 (Australia), \u22120.688 (Canada), 0.293 (China), 0.484 (Germany), 0.736 (South Korea) and 0.922 (the UK).",

In particular, the growth of South Korean's GDP per capita 1 month before had a significant impact on South Korean visitors by air transport to New Zealand. The growth in bilateral trade volumes between five countries (Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan and the UK) and New Zealand had a significant positive impact on their respective visitor arrivals to New Zealand. However, the expected negative effect of exchange rate on visitor arrivals by air transport to New Zealand (i.e. New Zealand's tourism demand) was not found in this study. The negative impact of fuel prices on New Zealand's biggest tourist source market (Australia) and its fastest growing market (China) was found in this study. Three exogenous shocks (the SARS outbreak of 2003, the global financial crisis of 2008 and the Christchurch earthquakes of 2011/12) had different negative effects on visitor arrivals by air transport among the studied markets, but they were largely consistent with generally accepted paradigms and had significant negative parameters.",
