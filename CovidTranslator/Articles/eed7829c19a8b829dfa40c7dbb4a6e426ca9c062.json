In this paper, we report an original finding that two redox-modulating agents, the ethacrynic and \u2423-lipoic acids (EA, LA), inhibit growth of vaccinia virus (VACV) in vitro. The effect of EA and LA was compared with those of \u2424-mercaptoethanol, DTT and ascorbic acid, but these agents increased VACV growth in HeLa G cells. The inhibitory effects of EA and LA on the growth of VACV were further confirmed in several cell lines of different embryonic origin, in epithelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages and T-lymphocytes.",

In 1980, the World Health Organization Smallpox Eradication Program declared the disease as eradicated (WHO, 1980) and vaccination of the general population has been stopped. Along with the rising concerns about the smallpox misuse in a bioterrorist attack, certain countries have been re-introducing vaccination programs among selected groups of population and re-considering a vaccination of the general population. However, the old vaccines that are available (New York City Board of Health strain of vaccinia virus -Dryvax; Wyeth Laboratories), and probably also the new vaccines based on the same virus strain but prepared in tissue culture (e.g. ACAM2000; Acambis) reveal a substantial risk of post-vaccination complications (Artenstein, 2008) . The most severe complications described during the eradication campaign include progressive vaccinia (vaccinia necrosum), post-vaccination encephalitis, and eczema vaccinatum (Aragon et al., 2003) . A new complication, myopericarditis, was described based on the recent vaccination of the military personnel with the old Dryvax vaccine by the US Department of Defense (Arness et al., 2004) , but it has also occurred during a trial with the new, tissue culture-based vaccine ACAM2000 (Artenstein, 2008) . * Corresponding author.

            "text": "Current therapeutic possibilities of poxvirus infections are rather limited. Vaccinia immune globulin or VIG, has been used for a passive immunization, providing immediate, 2-3 weeks lasting protection against infection, as well as for treatment of postvaccination complications. However, its effectiveness has never been assessed in properly controlled trials (Bray and Wright, 2003) . The only drug currently allowed for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of certain reactions to the smallpox vaccine is cidofovir (CDV), a nucleoside analogue originally approved for treatment of CMV infections in immunocompromised individuals (De Clercq, 2007; De Clercq and Hol\u00fd, 2005) . A disadvantage of this compound is its intravenous administration and nephrotoxicity (Safrin et al., 1997 ). An ether-lipid analogue of CDV, CMX001, reveals a good oral bioavailability and a low toxicity with similar antipoxvirus efficiency as CDV (Parker et al., 2008) . This compound is currently evaluated in clinical trials (http://www.chimerix-inc.com/pdfs news/ Chimerix%20Initiates%20CMX001%20%20Multi-dose.pdf). Another drug, ST-246, inhibits a late step in VACV morphogenesis and its egress from the cell (Yang et al., 2005) . It has been also evaluated in clinical trials (http://www.siga.com/?ID=65). This experimental drug was permitted for use in a single case of eczema vaccinatum together with VIG and cidofovir (Kaiser, 2007) . Additionally, thiosemicarbazone derivatives had been used in the past for anti-poxvirus prophylaxis as well as treatment, but the effectiveness of individual derivatives was never properly assessed in placebocontrolled human trials (Pirrung et al., 2005; Smee and Sidwell, 2003) . A recent study in mice, however, suggested that neither isatin-\u2424-thiocarbazone (IBT) nor its derivative marboran may be useful in therapy of poxvirus infections. They effectively reduced the mortality of mice infected systemically only with VACV but not with cowpox virus, while they did not reduce replication of either virus or clinical illness in mice infected cutaneously (Quenelle et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "In this paper, we report a new finding that ethacrynic and \u2423lipoic acids inhibit growth of vaccinia virus in vitro. Ethacrynic acid (EA) is a well known clinically used thiol-reactive diuretic agent and a Na + /K + /Cl \u2212 co-transport system inhibitor (available under various trade names, e.g., Edecrin, Edecril, Reomax; (Griffiths and Simmons, 1987; Koechel and Rankin, 1978) . It has been also used to decrease the intraocular pressure in glaucoma (Melamed et al., 1992) . Finally, it is known to inhibit glutathione-S-transferase (Piclass; GST), and thus to deplete both cytosolic and mitochondrial stores of GSH, serving as an experimental pro-oxidant (Meredith and Reed, 1982) . The inhibition of GST by EA has been clinically employed to potentiate the effects of anti-cancer drugs by decreasing their conjugation and elimination from the organism (Gate and Tew, 2001) . \u2423-Lipoic acid (LA) is a thiol-containing, redoxcycling agent. As the lipoamide, it serves as a cofactor of pyruvate dehydrogenase and other multienzyme complexes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of \u2423-keto acids. Additionally, it acts as an antioxidant involved in free radical quenching, antioxidant recycling, and metal chelation. It has been shown to be effective in various experimental and clinical studies focused on therapy of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, myocardial and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury Holmquist et al., 2007; Packer et al., 1995) . LA has been used as a food additive (available under various trade names, e.g. Alpha Lipoic Acid, Heparlipon, Thioctsan) and it has been also proposed to ameliorate the HIV-induced redox-stress in the organism (Jariwalla et al., 2008) .",

VACV growth cycle is a sequential process in which a successful accomplishment of one step is pre-requisite for the next one (Schramm and Locker, 2005) . Thus, expression of VACV late genes governed by VACV late promoters can occur only after replication of VACV DNA. Consequently, recombinant VACVs expressing luciferase under control of two different promoters, the early/late p7.5 (Luc E/L) and the late p4b (Luc L), in combination with the inhibition of VACV DNA synthesis by cytosine arabinoside (AraC), can be used to distinguish if the inhibitory effect occurs before or after DNA synthesis. HeLa G cells were infected with Luc E/L or Luc L in the absence or presence of AraC, an inhibitor of DNA polymerase, and treated with indicated concentrations of EA or LA. Concentration of AraC used, 4.4 g/ml, was experimentally determined to inhibit VACV growth and not to induce death of the host cells. At 24 h.p.i., the cells were collected and activity of luciferase was determined. In agreement with the previous experiments, both EA and LA revealed a dosedependent inhibitory effect on activity of Luc E/L and Luc L in the absence of AraC ( Fig. 2A and C) . In the presence of AraC, the activity of luciferase expressed by Luc L was decreased to approximately 0.05% or less of the mock-treated controls grown in the absence of AraC, i.e. to the levels very close to the background; neither EA nor LA affected this result ( Fig. 2B and D, respectively) . In contrast, the activity of luciferase expressed by Luc E/L in the presence of AraC was decreased less, only to about 1 or 4% of the controls, due to the persisting expression of luciferase governed by the early portion of the promoter p7.5. Different concentrations of neither EA nor LA further decreased this measurable activity of luciferase ( Fig. 2B and D, respectively), suggesting that neither EA nor LA affect VACV early gene expression.",

The difference in the effective concentrations of EA and LA may reflect their mode of modification of the thiol moieties. EA is an alkylating agent (Bowes and Gupta, 2005; Han et al., 2005) and it could irreversibly bind to the essential cysteine residues. In contrast, action of LA may be reversible due to its redox cycling (Packer et al., 1995) . Alternatively, it is possible to suggest that the net effect of both EA and LA would be pro-oxidant. EA inhibits GST, and thus inhibits regeneration of the GSH pool. In contrast, LA promotes regeneration of GSH. However, dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) that is supposed to form quickly from LA inside the cell has been suggested to release iron from its storage protein ferritin and reduce Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ ; Fe 2+ can initiate lipid peroxidation, and consequently decrease GSH levels (Packer et al., 1995) . In any case, the effects of EA and LA on VACV late gene expression might be also indirect, possibly through the action in the same cascade of events but at distinct steps. Evidently, the same tasks cannot be fulfilled by \u2424mercaptoethanol, DTT or ascorbic acid, the compounds that favor reducing conditions. On the contrary, these compounds increased VACV growth, suggesting that different redox conditions differently influence VACV growth. These effects might be related to a cytoplasmic redox pathway that is encoded by VACV, as discussed below.",

Along these lines, LA can decrease HIV provirus reactivation (Merin et al., 1996; Pande and Ramos, 2003) . In contrast, VACV itself inhibits NF-B pathway through several gene products (Graham et al., 2008) . It is, therefore, unclear if inhibition of NF-B by EA or LA could further inhibit NF-B activation, and prevent VACV growth in this way.",

The effects were characterized by virus titers and activity of luciferase in cells of different embryonic origin. It should be emphasized that all the recombinant viruses used in this study reveal similar growth properties in vitro. The inhibitory concentrations were found lower for rVACV than for WT VACV, and values of IC 50 were lower when calculated from virus titers than from luciferase activity. Based on IC 50 , EA was most effective in HeLa G cells, while LA was so in macrophages. For the rest of the cells, values of IC 50 for EA were in the range of 10-20 M for both viruses, while for LA, values of IC 50 were in the range of 200-500 M for rVACV and 500-800 M for WT VACV. Under conditions of the antiviral assays, the two compounds did not induce any obvious cytotoxic effects in any concentration used, except for Jurkat cells in which 50 M EA seemed to be toxic, as assessed by optical microscopy. However, based on the results of the MTT assays in actively dividing cells, EA and LA were found relatively non-toxic only for the epithelial and fibroblast cell lines, while they revealed inhibitory effects on macrophage and T-cell lines. Possibly, different redox milieu of the distinct cell types might be responsible for different effects of the two agents. Alternatively, different pattern of expression of GST isoenzymes and their interaction with EA or the elimination of EA from the cell may play a role (Gate and Tew, 2001) . EA and LA inhibited VACV growth even in macrophages stimulated with IFN\u2425, in which VACV growth was already potently inhibited. This inhibition has been known to be at least partially mediated by IFN\u2425-induced expression of iNOS and production of nitric oxide (Karupiah et al., 1993; Melkov\u00e1 and Esteban, 1994, 1995) . In this respect, LA has been shown to inhibit LPS-induced NF-B-and AP-1-mediated iNOS and TNF-\u2423 expression in Kupffer cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages (Kiemer et al., 2002) . Similarly, we have observed that addition of \u2424-mercaptoethanol decreased accumulation of nitrite, a stable oxidation product of nitric oxide, and increased VACV growth in IFN\u2425-stimulated J774.G8 macrophages (Melkov\u00e1, 1995) .",

In contrast, several lines of evidence suggest, that the affected step is at the level of virus late gene expression, or possibly later. First, we used recombinant viruses expressing luciferase under control of two different promoters, the early/late p7.5 (Luc E/L) and the late p4b (Luc L). In combination with the inhibition of VACV DNA synthesis by AraC, these viruses can be used to distinguish if the inhibited process occurs before or after DNA synthesis. The overall activity, as well as protein levels of the reporter luciferase expressed by both viruses, were found decreased in HeLa G cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of EA or LA. It should be emphasized that uninhibited, absolute activities of luciferase expressed by Luc L are several times higher than those expressed by Luc E/L. Upon inhibition of VACV DNA synthesis by AraC, levels of luciferase expressed by either rVACV were undetectable by Western blot analysis. In the presence of AraC, the activity of luciferase expressed by Luc L was strongly inhibited, while the activity of luciferase expressed by Luc E/L was decreased less, with absolute levels several times higher than those in Luc Linfected samples; these results confirm that luciferase expression by Luc L really occurs after DNA synthesis, while luciferase expression by Luc E/L occurs also earlier, before DNA synthesis takes place. However, neither EA nor LA decreased luciferase activity expressed under control of the early promoter, suggesting that these agents did not affect expression of early genes.",

Third, quantification of VACV DNA by real-time PCR yielded no differences in DNA levels due to EA or LA treatments, the result demonstrating that the inhibitory action of EA and LA takes place at the level of late gene expression or later. This conclusion is further supported by results of the time of addition assays. They indicated that addition of EA or LA up to 8 h.p.i., i.e. the time when DNA synthesis was accomplished according to real-time PCR, significantly decreased virus growth characterized by luciferase activity.",
