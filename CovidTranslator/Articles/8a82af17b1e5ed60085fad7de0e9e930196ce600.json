            "text": "Population-level analyses often use average quantities to describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does not arise from identifiable groups 1,2 . A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number, R 0 , which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population 3, 4 . Population estimates of R 0 can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by numerous 'superspreading events' in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear 2,10,11 . Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R 0 is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform populationwide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency.",

For directly transmitted infections, however, the overall infectiousness of each case-that is, the number of other individuals infected during the infectious lifetime of a single individual-arises from a complex mixture of host, pathogen and environmental factors (see Supplementary Notes). Consequently, the degree of infectiousness is distributed continuously in any population 4, 7, 11, 15, 16 and, crucially, distinct risk groups often cannot be defined a priori 2, 11 . This impedes the conventional approach to adding heterogeneity to epidemic models, in which populations are divided into homogeneous subgroups [2] [3] [4] 17 .",

The negative binomial model is selected decisively for several data sets, and enables comparative study of diseases through the dispersion parameter. Like SARS, measles in highly vaccinated populations shows high variation in two surveillance data sets, with narrow confidence intervals excluding the conventional models (note that heterogeneous vaccination coverage is an important environmental factor contributing to this pattern). Monkeypox and smallpox viruses show intermediate variation, consistent across multiple data sets, and pneumonic plague transmission is slightly less variable.

For example, if R 0 \u00bc 3 then q \u00bc 0.06 under the assumption of homogeneous n (k ! 1), or q \u00bc 0.33 if k \u00bc 1, but if k \u00bc 0.16 (as estimated for SARS) then q \u00bc 0.76. Extinction risk rises owing to a higher proportion of non-transmitting cases when n is overdispersed (Figs 1a, 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a) . This effect thwarts invasion by diseases that are very potent spreaders on average: for arbitrarily high R 0 , q ! 1 as k ! 0 ( Supplementary Fig. 2b) . The expected number of cases before extinction is hardly affected by k (Supplementary Fig. 2c) , because low-k outbreaks that fail probably lacked SSEs and thus resemble homogeneous outbreaks with lower R 0 .

Here we explore ) under individual-specific control compared to population-wide control, for diseases with R 0 \u00bc 3 and different degrees of individual variation, k, subject to control effort c. With population-wide control, the infectiousness of all individuals is reduced by a factor c. With individual-specific control, a proportion c of infectious individuals (selected at random) have their infectiousness reduced to zero.

Control policies are population-wide (solid lines), random individual-specific (dotted lines), or targeted individual-specific (dashed lines, where half of all control effort is focused on the most infectious 20% of cases). For k ! 1, all individuals are identical, so targeting has no effect and dotted and dashed lines overlay one another. d, The factor by which targeting increases the effect of control on preventing a major outbreak, relative to random individual-specific control (see Supplementary Notes), when 20%, 40% or 60% of the total population is controlled. Results in c and d are the mean of 10,000 simulations, with control beginning in the second generation of cases. several idealized cases theoretically, for an outbreak with offspring distribution Z , negative binomial(R 0 ,k) before control (see Supplementary Notes). Consider the effect of control effort c, where c \u00bc 0 reflects no control and c \u00bc 1 reflects complete blockage of transmission. Under population-wide control, the infectiousness of every individual in the population is reduced by a factor c (that is, n pop c \u00bc \u00f01 2 c\u00den for all individuals). Under random, individualspecific control, a proportion c of infected individuals (chosen at random) is traced and isolated completely such that they cause zero infections (that is n ind c \u00bc 0 for a proportion c of infected individuals, and n ind c \u00bc n for the rest). Individual-specific control raises the degree of heterogeneity in the outbreak as measured by the variance-tomean ratio of Z, whereas population-wide control reduces heterogeneity. Both approaches yield effective reproductive number R \u00bc (1 2 c)R 0 , so the threshold control effort for guaranteed disease extinction is c $ 1 2 1/R 0 as in conventional models. For intermediate values of c, however, the individual-specific approach always works better (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 3a, b) , consistent with our finding that higher variation favours disease extinction (Fig. 2b) . Branching process theory confirms that q ind . q pop whenever c [ (0,1 2 1/R 0 ) (see Supplementary Notes).",

This increased skew in transmission arose chiefly from undiagnosed or misdiagnosed individuals, who continued to infect others (and even cause SSEs), whereas controlled individuals infected very few. To further examine our control theories, we calculated k pop c and k ind c for each data set;k c was always closer to k ind c , although twice it fell between the two predictions, indicating a possible combination of control mechanisms (Fig. 3b) .

As more data become available, trends may emerge in the degree of variation present, for example, for different modes of spread or levels of virulence.

Realization of targeted control measures requires a better understanding of factors determining individual infectiousness. This work must be integrated with established theory of sexually transmitted diseases and social networks, where high-risk groups exert nonlinear influence on R 0 because contact rates affect infectiousness and susceptibility equally 3, 4, 12, 13, 22 . All diseases probably show intermediate degrees of covariation between infectiousness and susceptibility, a topic demanding empirical and theoretical study 17 .

            "text": "Analysis of disease data. For data sets including the full distribution of Z, we estimatedR 0 andk using maximum-likelihood methods. The candidate models were compared using Akaike's information criterion (AIC c ) modified for small sample size. Confidence intervals fork were estimated by bias-corrected nonparametric bootstrapping and corroborated by four other methods. For data sets including only estimates ofR 0 and the proportion of cases not transmitting (p 0 ), we estimatedk by solvingp 0 \u00bc \u00f01 \u00feR 0 =k\u00de 2k numerically, and evaluated the candidate models using confidence intervals calculated by two methods. Expected proportions of transmission due to particular groups of infectious individuals (Fig. 1b, c) were calculated using the gamma distribution of n with estimated values ofR 0 andk. See Supplementary Notes for details, and for descriptions of data sets. Branching process analysis. Analysis of branching process models centres on the probability generating function (pgf) of the offspring distribution, g\u00f0s\u00de \u00bc P 1 j\u00bc0 Pr \u00f0Z \u00bc j\u00de s j , defined for jsj # 1. When R 0 . 1, the longterm probability of disease extinction after introduction of a single infected individual is the unique solution of q \u00bc g(q) on the interval (0,1). For a negative binomial offspring distribution Z < NegB(R 0 ,k), the pgf is g\u00f0s\u00de \u00bc \u00f01 \u00fe R0 k \u00f01 2 s\u00de\u00de 2k . Under population-wide control, Z pop c < NegB\u00f0\u00f01 2 c\u00deR 0 ; k\u00de and therefore g pop \u00f0s\u00de \u00bc \u00f01 \u00fe \u00f01 2 c\u00de R0 k \u00f01 2 s\u00de\u00de 2k ; and the variance-tomean ratio is 1 \u00fe (1 2 c)R 0 /k. Under random individual-specific control, the exact pgf is g ind \u00f0s\u00de \u00bc c \u00fe \u00f01 2 c\u00de 1 \u00fe R0 k \u00f01 2 s\u00de \u00c0 \u00c1 2k with variance-to-mean ratio 1 \u00fe R 0 =k \u00fe cR 0 . This scenario can be approximated by Z ind;NB c < NegB\u00f0\u00f01 2 c\u00deR 0 ; k ind c ), where k ind c is the solution to p 0 \u00fe c\u00f01 2 p 0 \u00de \u00bc 1 \u00fe R ind c =k ind c \u00c0 \u00c1 2k ind c and decreases monotonically as c increases.
