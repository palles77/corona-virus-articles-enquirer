Two sequential deaths in captive fur seals occurred at Sea World, Australia during December 2017. A fibrinosuppurative bronchopneumonia in a Subantarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus tropicalis) resulted in death within 24 h of nonspecific signs of illness, whereas a septic peritonitis in a New Zealand fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri) resulted in death within 12 h of clinical presentation. The cases happened within three days in two different pool locations, although both had previously been housed in the same area. A total of six Pasteurella multocida isolates were obtained from several internal organs at necropsy in both cases and were subjected to whole genome sequencing and phylogenomic analysis. In-silico typing of the isolates revealed that all belonged to Multi-Locus Sequence Type 7 and carried lipopolysaccharide outer core biosynthesis loci Type 3. Phylogenomic analysis of the isolates confirmed that the isolates were near identical at the core genome level, suggesting acquisition from a common source. The results also revealed the presence of within host and across animal diversity of P. multocida isolates for the first time even in a clearly connected outbreak.",

As well, P. multocida is an opportunistic organism which lives as a commensal in the upper respiratory system of different animal species including mammals, birds and reptiles (Wilson and Ho, 2013) . The organism is also an important zoonotic pathogen and responsible for the majority of human wound infections following animal bites (Kimura et al., 2004) . It has been suggested that P. multocida can even infect a human host through secretion droplets via scratching, licking and kissing (Kimura et al., 2004) .",

Once stimulated to move to the surface from the bottom of the pool, the seal was observed floating right side up and holding onto the side of the pool with its right fore and hind flippers. When submerged under water, the seal made minimal effort to return to the surface, and in doing so would return to hold on to the side of the pool. Cefovecin, diazepam, flunixin meglumine and subcutaneous fluids were administered poolside. Following a one hour period of observation, concern that the seal was beginning to aspirate water resulted in the decision to move the animal to the Veterinary Quarantine Centre (VQC) on-site at Sea World, Australia. Once dry-docked, amikacin, dexamethasone, thiamine, intravenous fluids and oxygen therapy was instituted. The seal remained depressed and prostrate with marked respiratory difficulty evidenced by open-mouth breathing and significant thoracic excursions, which worsened through the night. On December 6th, following a 14 h therapeutic period, the patient remained moribund in a critical condition. Due to a poor prognosis, a decision was made to euthanize the seal with an intramuscular overdose of tiletamine-zolazepam (Zoletil\u00ae).",

Our in-silico typing showed that all the seal isolates carried LPS outer core biosynthesis loci type 3, which is the most prevalent LPS type carried by the P. multocida isolates associated with fowl cholera in Australia (Harper et al., 2013) . However, our data suggested that the LPS of the seal isolates have a unique gatG sequence which has not been previously reported. Consequently, the results obtained from MLST and LPS typing of the seal isolates are possibly suggesting that the birds transiting through the pools are responsible for introducing the outbreak isolate to the seals. Several species of seabirds frequent the pools at Sea World Australia, which supports this hypothesis. However, more studies including sampling the guano of the visiting birds would be needed to get more information about the source of the infection.",

It also showed genetic diversity even within the same seal with the Case 1 thoracic fluid and lung isolates differing by 12 SNPs. This finding suggests that this seal has been originally infected with at least two different strains. As single colonies were initially picked from the primary plates for both tissues, it is not possible to determine if both of the genetic types seen in Case 1 were present in both sampled tissues. However, in Case 2, the two available isolates from the abdominal fluid (two separate fluid collections were cultured) yielded isolates that differed by 5 or 7 SNPs from the Case 1 thoracic fluid isolate.
