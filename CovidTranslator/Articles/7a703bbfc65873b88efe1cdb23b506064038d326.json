In the absence of explicit guidance, use of accepted standards in the field are a reasonable and commonly used substitute, codified in documents such as Cumitech 31A. 2 Verification could entail comparing the new AST method with a reference standard such as broth microdilution (BMD), but this gold-standard method requires significant assay expertise, technologist effort, and ready availability of antimicrobial powder.

For example, the AR Isolate Bank includes an Enterobacteriaceae carbapenem breakpoint panel designed to assist with verification and implementation of new Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) carbapenem breakpoints, given emergence of novel resistance mechanisms. The gram-negative carbapenemase detection panel supports verification of tests for carbapenemase production such as the modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM) and EDTA-mCIM (eCIM), which can distinguish serine b-lactamases from metallo-b-lactamases. 7 Importantly, these strain sets include an assortment of well-characterized multidrug-resistance mechanisms, such as a range of serine and metallocarbapenemases, which would be difficult for clinical laboratories to collect comprehensively from their own patients or purchase, and thereby allow clinical laboratories to gain experience with detection of critical resistance elements in their own laboratories.",

Particularly in the superbug era, accurate AST reporting of SDD categories formerly classified as \"intermediate\" can be crucial in providing appropriate salvage therapeutic options for multidrug resistant infections. 8 In summary, the recently created FDA-CDC AR Isolate Bank provides welcome support for clinical microbiology laboratories as well as a resource for researchers, diagnostics, and pharmaceutical companies. This resource should be supported and strengthened, and ongoing \"free availability\" should be maintained with release/ updating of panels to coincide with new drug approvals to counterbalance disincentives for clinical laboratories and companies to invest in capacity for rarely used antimicrobials and testing.",

We also might consider, if new AST methods were appropriately vetted by the FDA, the encore verification performance by clinical laboratories, whether limited or extensive, seems superfluous. It is estimated to take approximately 2 days of technologist and director time to validate a new E-test or disk method with 30 to 40 strains-that is, a discouraging barrier for bringing new AST tests on board. Importantly, laboratories also perform a mini-verification every time they perform a test by running quality control (QC) testing with confirmation that results are within specified limits (individualized QC plan, exceptions aside). Presumably QC requirements are deemed appropriately discriminatory for evaluation of ongoing assay performance, so why the initial extra verification step? Verification should be an issue for initial vetting by the manufacturer with appropriately large, representative strain sets, and test product deficits should not fall under the purview of postmarketing discovery by laboratories with greatly differing capabilities. If this seemingly redundant and purposefully vague verification requirement were lifted, the broad array of AST testing for new drugs could be implemented within days! Another option, although potentially burdensome and perhaps unnecessary, would be to task a set of high complexity clinical laboratories on a volunteer basis or possibly with some financial recompense to perform an independent assessment to verify manufacturer's claims that could be relied on by the field.",

For example, aztreonam, a monobactam, remains active against metallocarbapenemases such as the New Delhi metallo-b-lactamase 1, and ceftazidimeavibactam provides activity against AmpC and extended-spectrum-b-lactamases (ESBLs), which are enzymes that inactivate aztreonam. Accordingly, a regimen that inhibits AmpC and ESBL degradation of aztreonam, which then can function in the presence of potent metallo-carbapenemases should be active against \"superbugs\" carrying these dangerous resistance elements. 9 However, the question remains how a clinical laboratory would determine whether combinatorial salvage regimens are active against a given isolate.",

LDTs fill this unmet need. LDTs are in vitro diagnostic tests developed and verified for local use. FDA-cleared methods that have been modified in any way by a clinical microbiology laboratory are also considered LDTs. 2 Prominent examples of LDTs would include viral load testing for BK virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the transplant setting. Although there are FDA-cleared assays for CMV viral load testing in blood, testing in other specimen types such as bronchoalveolar lavage, urine, and saliva provide added value for certain populations. Application of revised breakpoints to existing commercial AST methods are also considered a modification and therefore an LDT. Commercial manufacturers often take years to seek clearance for such updates, as the FDA does not have the authority to require companies to submit data within a certain timeframe. Accordingly, during this interval, clinical laboratories must verify accuracy and precision across revised breakpoints. Without the capacity or expertise to implement LDTs, laboratories presumably must continue to use outdated breakpoints, which could miss resistant strains and undermine patient care. As one example of the magnitude of this issue, 28% of laboratories in California had not yet lowered carbapenem breakpoints within 5 years of CLSI introducing revised, evidenced-based cutoffs in 2010. 15 Alternatively, LDT testing, whether for molecular diagnosis of target pathogens or AST determinations with revised breakpoints, may be performed at reference laboratories, which have extensive menus of LDTs but with suboptimal turnaround time delays.",

To expand this idea further, the authors also propose a repository of free publicly available critical analytes that would allow standardization of LDT assays across facilities (eg, viral load standards) and ensure robust detection, for example, of critical viral subtypes in the face of genetic drift and emerging variants.",

Our proposal would be to lower the approval threshold for areas of focused need that would not normally be appealing for commercial development under current regulations. Specifically, companies would still have to establish robust analytical performance for their methodology, however, without the need for extensive and costly clinical trials to establish clinical performance/utility. This would spur innovation, development, and implementation of laboratory tests in areas such as detection of rare emerging diseases (MERS, Ebola, carbapenemase detection and discrimination, blood parasites, seasonal influenza subtyping for therapeutic discrimination, tick-borne bloodstream infection, and Candida auris to forestall hospital outbreaks). Transplant and immunocompromised host infectious disease testing could also be extended to the range of sample types of importance (eg, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and other respiratory specimens for molecular detection of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) and toxoplasma among others). The European diagnostics market, for example, offers excellent diagnostic support for clinical care without the extra layer of regulatory burden.",

As one example of potential impact, the Israel National Center for Infection Control initiated an effort in 2008 within long-term care facilities where they collected a real-time database of all CRE carriers and events leading to acquisition. The program facilitated supervised information exchange and encompassed approximately 25,000 beds over 300 institutions enabling early detection of carriers and implementation of population-specific contact precautions. 26 These efforts achieved more than a 10-fold reduction of CRE point prevalence in their acute hospital network and 50% reduction in all facilities.
