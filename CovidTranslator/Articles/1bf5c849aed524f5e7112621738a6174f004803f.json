Before a vaccine is made, there will always be a threat of being infected and killed on duty as a HCW. We witnessed a number of HCW who started to think about withdrawing from their post. It is ethically unacceptable to abandon patients. However, beyond the duty of a HCW, should we demand (or even expect) that HCW should be ready to sacrifice their lives for our society in severe pandemics, like the outbreak of SARS. As one doctor in Taiwan said: 'It too heavy to be called as a hero; I just did what I should'. We understand that even a virtuous doctor or nurse might not be willing to die for a patient. Does the accepted norm of responsibility mean they must put their own lives at risk? One important point is that the social function of medical professionals can not be replaced by others. Even in times of peace, we should always remember the reality that being a helper of sickness will always present a certain risk of being infected. Medical professions have been well-rewarded by the society not only because they are competent in operating medicine but they chose the work of being a 'life saver'.",

Beside academic achievement, the profit they can make for their institute is the element to promote their position in their profession. It is easy to loss the ideas of being heroes that is part of the intrinsic nature of being doctors or nurses. Most modern hospitals there are designed under the intention of attracting people to visit frequently. Besides for a commercial hospital, the most effective way to limit the budget is to reduce labour costs. To use part time staffs saves much money from less benefit and salary pay. Could we expect nurses who were called when they are needed and paid by working hour to devote themselves to the full professional code and make all efforts when their life is threatened? It is obvious that the feeling of belonging and sense of nobility are essential for a professional worker, the problem is do we really respect those health worker as health profession to supply the components to achieve the sense of a professional.",

Those medical practitioners who stick to their post should be respected; however, those who need to take a break to recover themselves would also be acting within their human rights and what is expected of a reasonable citizen. There are cases recorded where doctors spent weeks continuously battling the disease, and there is need for a proper assessment of how fatigue may have led to mistakes in care for patients and mistakes in precautions of carers. There is a human limit for everyone to cope with. Those who battled self-lessly are called exceptions, for example, Ye Xin, 47, head nurse at the Guangdong Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, died in March after contracting SARS while treating patients infected with the virus.

His brother was infected by him and it was the first fatal case of SARS in Taiwan. One woman, who took the same train with him, was highly suspected to be the source of a major hospital outbreak.

People in Japan in May blamed a doctor who traveled from Taiwan who later came down with SARS. All the people they blamed were just being human, but foreigners are convenient targets. The Chinese government was so concerned about the image of China that it is rumoured that persons were threatened by death in case they transmitted the disease to foreign countries. 10 If we view the work of medicine a sacred vocation, an inner calling to dedicate and care for the sick, it is contradictory to imagine some medical doctors may be accused of giving rise to a great loss of our society. Taiwanese society decided to punish some of the head doctors who did not detect and report the hospital infection in the early stage. The final decision was to give the very tough punishment of retracting their professional license. Ethically a wrong decision should not be punished as a crime of that magnitude unless the health profession had a criminal intention (motivation). Although the consequences were a great loss for society it is not a wise move for the future to punish physicians for making mistaken decisions in emergency circumstances over public health if they were not intending any cover-up. There seems to be a threat of political scapegoats in every health crisis. We can expect future HCWs to move for greater self-protection and hesitance in making decisions that are necessary for public health crises like emerging diseases.",

It is normal and proper for people to be scared to die yet fulfill their duty in the frontline. Except for special 'danger pay' or another kind of reimbursement, a calling for increased emphasis on workplace safety and a review of precautions is most important for this critical situation. A well trained and equipped health worker also needs to prepare for the frontline of possible bioterrorism, which may be similar to what we saw with SARS. We need a well prepared expert more than a hero. There were cases reported where proper diagnosis of other diseases was hindered by the infection prevention measures being applied to treat all patients from SARS infected areas as potential SARS victims. 12 Spiritual motivation should not slacken the implementation of sound precautionary measures.",

Before the next outbreak, we need long-term planning and humane intervention to prepare a better response for the expected return of the disease. In the future if some repressive regimes are hit by SARS they might employ brutal tactics to quarantine and isolate people, possibly sowing division among outside countries and multilateral organizations over how to respond to apparent human rights violations. 15 Calls for development of effective Centers for Disease Control in other regions of the world, including Europe, have been made in response to the ways SARS was fought. 16 The intention of calling for HCWs to above all do good should not be blurred by wrong planning.",

If people were diagnosed to be suspect or probable cases, all the people around them may as well be suspected of having been contaminated by them. Consequently, the persons they have been in close contact with, for example, families, colleagues or schoolmates may be isolated to avoid further possible spread of the disease. Such home isolation has serious social and psychological influences. In some cases, those who break home isolation may be punished by imposing a fine. People who were victims of SARS in 2003 were accused of hindering the prevention or treatment of sudden disease outbreaks if they broke such isolation. It is normal to expect that quarantine will cause fears, and people will lose their patience and self-restraint, but we should assume that all people were originally infected by others with a few recent exceptions infected by laboratory medical research. Persons should be taken care of better than being totally restricted to avoid them inflicting possible harm on others. With the policy of respecting human individuals complete needs for physical and mental well being, more people will be motivated not just to protect themselves, but to contribute to the macro wellbeing of the society. There are still lessons for all in society about the ethics of quarantine. Modern society has forgotten the past risks of infectious disease outbreaks.",
