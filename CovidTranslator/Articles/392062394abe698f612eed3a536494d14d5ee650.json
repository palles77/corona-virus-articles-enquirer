Recently proposed criteria require fever as mandatory, include perineal rash with changes in the extremities, and recognize that, in the presence of fever and coronary artery changes demonstrated by echocardiography, fewer than four criteria are required to make the diagnosis of KD. 6 Muta and colleagues 7 showed that fever for four or fewer days in the presence of four other criteria increased the sensitivity of the criteria.

In an Australian study, only 20% of children were younger than 1 year old at diagnosis, and 25% were older than 5 years old. The reasons for the geographic differences in age at onset are unclear. 24 Several reports document a seasonal incidence of KD. 24, 25 In Japan, the disease occurs most frequently in January, June, and July, with a nadir in October. This pattern was observed every year for the 14 years of the study in Japan. 25 This bimodal distribution was not noted in Taiwan, where the highest incidence was in the summer. 17 In North America, cases have tended to occur between November and May. 26 Clustering of cases in time and geographic area further suggests an unrecognized vector. Kao and colleagues 27 demonstrated a temporal and spatial clustering of disease in San Diego County, California, U.S.A. Although epidemics of KD were documented in Japan up to 1987, none has occurred since then. 28 In Japan, siblings of affected children have a risk of contracting KD that is approximately 10 times higher than the risk in the general population, 29 but cases among children sharing the same home in other countries are uncommon. 25 Dergun and colleagues 30 reported 18 families in the U.S. with 24 affected members, including nine sibling pairs.

If an infectious agent does indeed cause KD, the putative organism would appear to be of very low communicability, or predominantly responsible for subclinical infections. Repeated attempts to identify a particular infectious trigger have been unsuccessful. 31 It is possible that vasculitis in KD is caused by either conventional antigens or by superantigens that trigger an immune response to endothelial cells, rather than by direct infection of the vessels. 32 Superantigens are produced by several bacteria, notably certain strains of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, and are capable of stimulating large numbers of T cells in an antigen-nonspecific manner by interaction with the \u03b2 chain of the T cell receptor. Overrepresentation of T cells bearing V\u03b22 among lymphocytes in coronary artery aneurysms, intestinal mucosa, 33,34 and peripheral blood 35 from patients with KD supports the hypothesized role of superantigens in the pathogenesis. A variety of additional circumstantial evidence [30] [31] [32] [36] [37] [38] and a murine model of Lactobacillus casei-induced vasculitis lend credence to this theory. Further, children with KD have unique reactions to mycobacterial antigens, 39-41 which may also function as superantigens, including recall reactions at the site of a previous bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin immunization. 39 Nonetheless, the only human illness definitively ascribed to superantigens is toxic shock syndrome, and other researchers have failed to identify evidence of a role for superantigens in the pathogenesis of KD. 42 Thus, whether these findings represent a specific response to superantigens or crossreactivity with other antigens is not clear.",

Reported genetic associations have been reviewed by Hata and Onouchi. 60 Candidate genes include those at the histocompatibility locus and those for other proteins involved in immunoregulation. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes for B5, B44, Bw51, DR3, and DRB3*0301 have been associated with KD in Caucasians; Bw54, Bw15, and Bw35 in Japanese; and Bw51 in Israelis. 61 However, Onouchi and colleagues 62 concluded that HLA polymorphisms contributed little to the pathogenesis of KD. There has been no reported association of any HLA antigen with the risk of coronary artery disease. 63 Polymorphisms of the TNF-\u03b1 gene (TNF), 64 the IL 18 gene, 65 the HLA E gene, 66 and the gene for angiotensin converting enzyme 67,68 have been associated with KD, but their pathogenic significance is disputed. A recent report implicated polymorphisms of the mannose binding lectin (MBL) in the pathogenesis of KD. 69 MBL binds to n-acetyl glucosamine and mannose present on the surface of many microbes. This interaction results in activation of complement (C3) independent of antibody. Levels of MBL are determined by polymorphisms of the MBL 2 gene and its promoters. Higher expression of MBL is associated with lower incidence of coronary artery lesions in patients under 1 year old, but it has the opposite effect in older patients. This apparent paradox is congruent with the belief that MBL is important in protecting the very young child from infectious diseases. 69 The gene controlling expression of inositol 1,4,5triphosphate 3-kinase (ITPKC) has recently been identified as a susceptibility gene not only for KD, but also for coronary artery disease. 70 This enzyme is strongly expressed by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and has an important role in inflammation by decreasing IL-2 expression. The functional polymorphism ITPKC 3 is significantly increased in patients with KD and coronary artery disease in Japanese and American populations. 71 Neither studies of individual genes nor genome-wide association studies 72 have revealed consistent markers of disease susceptibility. Thus, to the extent that certain children are predisposed to developing KD, the effect is likely due to small contributions from multiple genetic loci.",

            "text": "At onset, there is usually a tachycardia commensurate with the degree of fever. \"Early myocarditis occurs in at least one-third 89 to one-half 90 of patients, and pericarditis also may occur. Myocardial involvement often leads to decreased contractility, commonly manifested by an S3 gallop that may become more prominent with hydration. Such children may be misdiagnosed with viral myocarditis. In more severe cases, myocardial involvement may progress to dysrhythmias and signs of congestive heart failure. 91 Children with prominent KD-associated myocarditis tend to respond less briskly to treatment with IVIG, but longterm abnormalities of cardiac contractility are nonetheless very uncommon in children treated appropriately during the acute phase of KD. 92 The most significant and characteristic complication of KD, the development of coronary artery aneurysms in up to 25% of untreated patients, makes KD the leading cause of acquired heart disease among children in the developed world (Figs. 33-5 and 33-6). Treatment with IVIG decreases the incidence of giant aneurysms (internal diameter >8 mm) by more than 95% and the overall incidence of aneurysms by 85%. Despite treatment, however, one retrospective survey reported that 8.5% of patients younger than 12 months old developed coronary artery abnormalities, compared with 1.8% of those 12 months old or older. 93 Overall, the odds ratio for development of cardiac sequelae in infants younger than 1 year old was 1.54. 94 Coronary aneurysms may cause morbidity early in the course due to rupture or thrombosis, resulting in sudden death or myocardial infarction. 95 Development of de novo coronary artery abnormalities more than two weeks after the end of the acute illness is unusual, although ongoing scarring of existing vascular lesions may result in progressive coronary insufficiency. Approximately onehalf of coronary artery aneurysms demonstrated by echocardiogram ultimately resolve, usually those smaller than 6 mm in diameter, 96 but persistent vasodilatory abnormalities have been observed in arteries where aneurysms have resolved. 97 Giant coronary artery aneurysms, with an internal diameter larger than 8 mm, are associated with the highest risk of morbidity and mortality. Up to onethird of such aneurysms become obstructed, leading to myocardial infarction, dysrhythmias, or sudden death. 98 Although involvement of the coronary arteries is the most characteristic manifestation of the vasculitis of KD, other medium-sized muscular arteries also may be involved. Aneurysms of brachial and femoral arteries may be palpable clinically or demonstrable angiographically ( Fig. 33-7) . In severe cases, peripheral arterial obstruction may lead to ischemia and gangrene. Visceral arteries are usually spared, although there are reports of gastrointestinal obstruction 99 and acute abdominal catastrophe 100 occurring because of vasculitis. Such complications generally arise in children with other signs of severe vasculitis, including aneurysms in coronary and peripheral arteries.",

Inflammation begins in the microvasculature (i.e., arterioles, capillaries, vasa vasorum, and venules) and subsequently spreads to larger vessels, especially the coronary arteries. 114 In these lesions, infiltrating cells are mostly macrophages and IgA-secreting plasma cells, 42 findings that may be unique to KD. 115 Endothelial cells express a variety of markers of activation, presumably as a result of the high levels of proinflammatory cytokines that characterize the acute phase of disease. 116 Some children have a lymphocytic myocarditis, with endomyocardial biopsy demonstrating cellular infiltrates or myofibrosis that may persist for years in untreated cases. 117 Evolution of the cardiac lesions is detailed in the study of Fujiwara and Hamashima. 114 Coronary artery vasculitis predominated early in the disease but was absent in those who died after 28 days of illness.

Although coronary artery dimensions in normal children have been shown to increase linearly with body surface area (BSA) or length, 131 these criteria are not based on body size. Evaluation of coronary arteries in KD using age-, size-, and sex-adjusted indices suggests that the incidence of abnormalities is higher than was generally recognized. 132 Among patients classified as having normal coronary arteries by the Japanese Ministry of Health criteria, 27% had at least one BSA-adjusted coronary artery dimension more than two standard deviations above the mean. Even children whose vessel dimensions are within the \"normal\" range may demonstrate a decrease in coronary artery diameter as they convalesce from KD. 133 Treatment strategies also depend on the implications of coronary artery dilatation. Long-term outcome studies are somewhat reassuring. Fifty percent of coronary artery aneurysms regress angiographically, and among such children, at least one longitudinal study demonstrated no increase in morbidity or mortality rates, even after more than two decades. 98 Nonetheless, abnormalities of more subtle markers of endothelial health are a matter of concern. Vessels show histological 134 and functional 135 abnormalities at the sites of healed aneurysms, and vascular reactivity to endogenous vasodilators is abnormal in children who have had KD, regardless of whether they have detectable coronary artery abnormalities. 136 This lends credence to the report of an increased longterm standardized mortality ratio of 2.35 among male patients with cardiac sequelae. 137 Acute phase reactants and platelet counts do not return to normal for up to 2 months after apparently successful treatment, suggesting that vasculitis and endothelial inflammation may not fully resolve, even when fever is controlled. It is reasonable to ask whether persistent KD requires additional therapy and whether initial treatment should be more robust than IVIG alone, at least for some children, aiming for anatomically and functionally normal vessels in everyone.",

            "text": "Aspirin was the first medication to be used for treatment of KD because of its anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects. 138 Anti-inflammatory regimens using high-dose (>80 mg/kg/day) or lower-dose (30 mg/kg/day) aspirin have been recommended during the acute phase of the illness. After the fever resolves, the dose is usually reduced to an antiplatelet range of 3 to 5 mg/kg/day. These doses, well below the anti-inflammatory level, have the effect of inhibiting platelet adhesion to endothelium by curtailing platelet release of thromboxane A 2 without suppressing prostacyclin production by endothelial cells. 139 This effect is believed to be beneficial in preventing thrombosis when platelet counts are elevated, although no studies have demonstrated such a benefit clinically, and aspirin does not appear to reduce the frequency of coronary artery abnormalities. 140 In the event of aspirin sensitivity, another antiplatelet agent, such as dipyridamole, should be considered. Unless coronary artery abnormalities are detected by echocardiogram, aspirin is discontinued after results of laboratory studies return to normal, usually within 2 months of disease onset. There have been no published comparisons of aspirin with other anti-inflammatory agents, and it is unclear whether salicylates are uniquely efficacious in this condition. A metaanalysis found that high-dose and lower-dose aspirin regimens were associated with a similar incidence of coronary artery abnormalities at 30 and 60 days after disease onset. 140 Although the necessity of using highdose aspirin might be questioned because of the rapid response to IVIG, all of the trials showing the benefit of IVIG were conducted with children who also were receiving anti-inflammatory doses of aspirin. For other effects, such as treatment of prolonged arthritis, alternative anti-inflammatory agents may be used. The AHA warns against prescribing ibuprofen because it antagonizes the antiplatelet effects of low dose aspirin. 87, 141 The risks of aspirin appear to be similar to those reported in other settings: chemical hepatitis, transient hearing loss, and, rarely, Reye syndrome. 142 These risks may be increased in KD. Aspirin binding studies have suggested that the hypoalbuminemia of children with KD predisposes them to toxic levels of free salicylate, despite measured (bound) values within the therapeutic range. 143",

Metaanalyses have documented a dose-response benefit of IVIG therapy in the range between 200 mg/kg and 2 g/kg. 146 Although standard therapy with IVIG and aspirin given within the first 10 days of illness greatly reduces the risk of coronary artery involvement, approximately 5% of children still develop coronary artery aneurysms, according to Japanese Ministry of Health criteria, and a larger number demonstrate coronary artery ectasia. In general, younger patients, especially infants younger than 6 months old, are at higher risk. 147 Stockheim and colleagues 148 reported that older children also were at additional risk. In their retrospective series, 21% of patients over 8 years old had coronary artery abnormalities.

Technical deficiencies in production led to more than 100 cases of hepatitis C in recipients of a single brand of IVIG in 1994, although none was a child with KD. 155 No cases of IVIG-transmitted infections have been reported since the institution of current purification and processing practices in 1995, and no cases of IVIGtransmitted HIV have ever been reported. Overall, cost-benefit analysis documents that IVIG treatment of KD is one of the most cost-effective medical therapies available, leading to impressive short-and long-term savings. 156 Infusion reactions (fever, rash, nausea, and hypotension) occasionally accompany IVIG administration and are best managed by slowing the rate of infusion and treating with diphenhydramine. With no viable alternative therapies, aggressive premedication with corticosteroids, or even use of a different brand of IVIG, is preferable to foregoing immunoglobulin. Rarely, a child might develop congestive heart failure during or after infusion of the IVIG because of the high solute load and subsequent increase in intravascular volume. Slowing the infusion rate and administration of furosemide are usually the only treatments required. Ultimately the improvement in myocardial contractility associated with IVIG treatment is almost invariably adequate therapy. 87 Hemolysis is uncommon, but occasionally it may be severe, requiring transfusion. Headache up to 72 hours after the infusion is common, especially in older patients. Such children may require low-dose opiates for relief. 157 Virtually all data concerning the role of IVIG are limited to treatment during the first 10 days of illness. This is not to say that treatment after 10 days of illness is ineffective or contraindicated; it is merely inadequately studied. In a report of 16 children with coronary artery aneurysms treated a mean of 17 days after onset of fever, there was a trend toward increased resolution of abnormalities by echocardiogram. 158 The American Academy of Pediatrics cautiously recommends IVIG for children beyond the 10th day of illness with \"manifestations of continuing inflammation,\" and such an approach appears prudent. 128 Questions have arisen concerning the efficacy of very early treatment of KD. Tse and colleagues, 159 on the other hand, reported that IVIG given on or before the fifth day of illness resulted in fewer coronary artery abnormalities at the 1-year follow-up assessment. Thus, decisions about the optimal date for treating with IVIG are best made based on a patient's clinical status and the certainty of the diagnosis of KD.",

Children who had failed to respond to two doses of IVIG were randomized to receive a third dose of IVIG or pulse-dose methylprednisolone. Patients who received methylprednisolone had a significantly shorter duration of fever, and although transient coronary artery dilatation was associated with glucocorticoid therapy, there was no overall difference in the incidence of coronary artery abnormalities between groups. Based on these studies, IVMP has become the mainstay of \"rescue\" therapy in children who are unresponsive to IVIG. 93 Might steroids also have a role to play earlier in the course of KD? Shinohara and colleagues 164 retrospectively reviewed the results in almost 300 patients with acute KD seen between 1982 and 1998 who were treated before the 10th day of illness. All patients received aspirin, dipyrimidole, and propranolol. The addition of prednisolone therapy, either alone or with IVIG, was associated with a significantly shorter duration of fever and a lower prevalence of coronary artery aneurysms. No adverse reactions were recorded for any therapy. A prospective study was suggestive of benefit as well; Inoue 165 reported that the frequency of coronary artery abnormalities in children treated with IVIG plus prednisolone 2 mg/kg/d was lower than in those treated with IVIG alone. Three other studies 161, 166, 167 have shown that children treated with IVMP (or dexamethasone) plus IVIG had faster resolution of fever, more rapid improvement in markers of inflammation, and shorter length of hospitalization than those receiving IVIG alone. Two of these studies had insufficient statistical power to detect a potential benefit of glucocorticoid therapy on coronary artery outcomes. The third trial, by Newburger and colleagues, found no significant difference in the frequency or severity of coronary artery lesions between treatment groups at one week or five week followup. Interestingly, however, post hoc analysis suggested that children who ultimately failed to respond to an initial dose of IVIG were less likely to develop coronary artery aneurysms if their initial therapy had included IVMP. Following up on this finding, the Osaka Kawasaki Disease Study Group 168 conducted a comparative trial of IVIG vs. IVIG plus IVMP in children with KD regarded as being at high risk for nonresponse to IVIG. 169 High risk was defined as the presence of at least two of the following: CRP \u22657 mg, total bilirubin \u22650.9 mg, or aspartate transaminase \u2265200 I.U./L. Patients were given heparin (10 U/kg/hr) for 48 hours beginning two hours before receiving IVMP (30 mg/kg), followed by IVIG (2 g/kg). Aspirin (30 mg/kg/d) was started at the end of the heparin infusion and reduced to 10 mg/kg/d after resolution of fever. Therapy was effective in 44% of those given IVIG alone compared to 66% of those receiving both IVIG and IVMP. The disease was refractory in 56% of those receiving IVIG alone and 11% of those receiving IVIG and IVMP, although a rebound fever was observed in 23% of those treated with IVIG and IVMP, but not in the group receiving IVIG alone. Coronary artery abnormalities, including aneurysms, were significantly less frequent in the IVIG plus IVMP group (24%) compared to the IVIG alone group (46%). In a meta-analysis of eight studies, Wooditch and Aronson concluded that the incidence of coronary artery aneurysms was reduced by the addition of corticosteroids to aspirin-containing therapeutic regimens. 162 While it is clear that corticosteroids are not a substitute for IVIG in the treatment of KD, a case may be made for the inclusion of corticosteroids in the initial management of children with KD who are high risk of being refractory to IVIG. Studies to date have shown a decrease in the frequency of coronary artery abnormalities in some children who received IVIG plus corticosteroids as initial therapy, in comparison to those who received IVIG alone. The toxicity associated with combination therapy appears to be higher than that seen with IVIG alone, although reactions are generally not severe. Further, with the addition of pulsed dose methylprednisolone, the systemic manifestations of KD (fever, rash, etc.) appear to resolve more quickly, and the duration of hospitalization is, on average, shortened. Clinical and biological markers to identify such high-risk children are improving 170 and ongoing trials are examining the effects of other adjunct therapies for treatment with IVIG. These studies should refine attempts to optimize the treatment of KD.",

Children whose coronary arteries have always been normal (risk level I) or are normal by echocardiographic criteria one to two months after the acute illness (risk level II) are regarded as healthy, and no further intervention is recommended after the eight-week follow-up assessment.
