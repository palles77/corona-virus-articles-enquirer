            "text": "Over 100 deaths were reported in the outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) over the past two years in China, and thousands of people were admitted to hospitals with moderate to severe symptoms of this disease. HFMD, commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) or enterovirus 71 (EV71), can proceed to serious complications such as meningitis, which can be fatal to small infants and children [1] . Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment for HFMD; therefore, there is an urgent need to discover effective drugs against this viral infection. AG7088 was developed originally to combat human rhinovirus (HRV), which is the major cause of the common cold. In Phase-II clinical trials, AG7088 demonstrated moderate antiviral and clinical efficacy. Because of a lack of efficacy in natural infection studies, further development was stopped. However, AG7088 has received attention again in recent years, because it is now considered a potent inhibitor of EV71 [2] [3] [4] [5] . The compound has been shown to inhibit the viral chymotrypsin-like protease (3C pro ), which is required for proteolytic processing of the large polyprotein translated from the viral RNA genome and is thus essential for the propagation of the virus [6] . As the safety of AG7088 has been confirmed, the development of AG7088 will be a shortcut for HFMD therapy. In addition, AG7088 derivative have also been shown to have antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [7] [8] [9] . Although AG7088 possesses good antiviral activity and has received much attention, there is limited information available in the literature concerning methods for its synthesis. Therefore, an efficient synthesis method for AG7088 is important and will benefit the development of antiviral drugs of this type. In this paper, we provide details of investigation and improvement of a new synthetic route for the preparation of AG7088.",

            "text": "As shown in the retrosynthetic analysis outlined in Figure 1 , AG7088 was prepared from three fragments: the lactam derivative (A), the ketomethylene dipeptide isostere (B), and an isoxazole acid chloride (C). The original synthetic route, reported by Dragovich et al., was coupling the ketoacid (B) with the lactam derivative (A) and the isoxazole acid chloride (C). Using this approach, AG7088 was syn- thesized with a total yield of about 0.6% in 13 steps [10, 11] . In this route, the lactam derivative (A) was obtained using natural glutamic acid within 13 steps [10] , and the key building block ketoacid (B) was obtained through a lactone (D) using diastereoselective alkylation of (\uf02d)-pseudoephedrinederived amide with p-fluorobenzyl bromide and subsequent lactonization was promoted by N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) as the key steps [11] . Then Tian et al. improved the synthesis of the lactam derivative (A) and simplified the reaction step to 8 steps [12] . Ma et al. improved the synthesis of the ketoacid (B) via the chiral alkylation of the lactone (E), avoiding use of the chiral catalyst as the key step. Based on Tian's work, they obtained AG7088 using L-valine as the starting material in about 7% yield in 16 steps [13, 14] . Meanwhile, Chng et al. reported a synthetic method of AG7088 using the isoxazole acid (C) as the starting material; however, the use of toxic reagents and the harsh reaction condition of this method might limit its synthetic usefulness [15] . Shie et al. reported an alternative route to synthesize the ketoacid (B) and obtained AG7088 using Cbz-L-valine as the starting material in 15.3% yield and 12 steps [16] . However, the harsh reaction conditions and inconvenient chromatographic fractionation were disadvantageous. Based on Shie's work, we improved the synthesis of the ketoacid (B) from two parts: the 2-substituted propionic acid B1 and the valine derivative B2. In this improved route, the synthesis of part B1 was accomplished using commercially available 4-fluorophenylalanine as the material in one step and the product was easily purified. An S N 2 reaction of part B1 and part B2 provided the ketoacid (B) without using chiral ligands or low temperature, and was much more convenient than chiral synthesis. Then we linked the ketoacid (B) with the lactam derivative (A) and the isoxazole acid chloride (C) to provide the final product AG7088 in 3 steps, which was much shorter than the one reported Shie et al. Finally, we obtained AG7088 in about 12% yield in 8 steps using Cbz-L-valine as the starting material.",

In this route, we started with the dianionic alkylation of N-Boc glutamic acid dimethyl ester 1 with iodoacetonitrile. As expected, this alkylation occurred in a highly stereoselective manner, giving 2 as the exclusive product (72% yield). In the following step, the cyano group in 2 was subjected to hydrogenation to generate the intermediate 3. Then, the in situ cyclization of intermediate 3 afforded the lactam 4 in 40% yield (from 1). The ester group in 4 was then reduced to the corresponding alcohol. The oxidization of the alcohol product 5 by Dess-Martin periodinane, followed by the Wittig reaction with an appropriate reagent, gave rise to the conjugated ester 7 in 65% Scheme 1 Synthesis of AG7088. yield (from 4). The designed lactam derivative 8 (Fragment A) was generated by removal of the protecting group of 7.",

The reaction mixture was stirred at \uf02d78 \u00b0C for additional 2 h and the disappearance of the starting material (1) was confirmed by TLC analysis. The reaction was quenched with methanol (3 mL) and a pre-cooled acetic acid in THF solution (2.7 mL HOAc/20 mL THF) was added. After stirring for 30 min, the cooling bath was removed. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm up to room temperature and then poured into a brine solution (40 mL). The layers were separated, and the organic layer was concentrated to afford dark brown oil. The crude residue was purified by flash column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate = 4/1) to give product 2 as colorless oil. 1 ",
