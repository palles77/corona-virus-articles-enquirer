However, because there is no protection against FMD immediately after vaccination, research and development on antiviral agents is being conducted to induce protection until immunological competence is produced. This study tested whether well-known chemicals used as RNA virus treatment agents had inhibitory effects on FMD viruses (FMDVs) and demonstrated that ribavirin showed antiviral effects against FMDV in vitro/in vivo. In addition, it was observed that combining the administration of the antiviral agents orally and complementary therapy with vaccines synergistically enhanced antiviral activity and preserved the survival rate and body weight in the experimental animals. Antiviral agents mixed with an adjuvant were inoculated intramuscularly along with the vaccines, thereby inhibiting virus replication after injection and verifying that it was possible to induce early protection against viral infection prior to immunity being achieved through the vaccine. Finally, pigs treated with antiviral agents and vaccines showed no clinical signs and had low virus excretion. Based on these results, it is expected that this combined approach could be a therapeutic and preventive treatment for early protection against FMD.",

FMD viruses (FMDVs) are a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus [16] and belong to the genus Aphthovirus, family Picornaviridae [4] ; the size of the virus genome is approximately 8.5 kb. These viruses are classified into seven serotypes-A, O, Asia1, C, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3and more than 60 subtypes [16] . FMD outbreaks cause a reduction in the productivity of infected animals (e.g., pigs, cows, lambs, and goats) [2, 3] . The culling of infected animals and events such as environmental contamination and loss of revenue from the livestock have emerged as important socioeconomic issues [21, 23] .",

Antiviral agents using chemical compounds are easily synthesized and scaled up in bulk, and they can be stored for a long period because chemical compounds are more stable than biologics. In addition, it was reported that such agents act directly on viruses as RNA inhibitors and are not specific to certain serotypes; thus, they may be administered to animals for emergency use when FMD occurs. FMD has never been eradicated and occurs in many countries in the world; regardless, research on antiviral agents to prevent and treat FMDVs is still limited.",

            "text": "During the past two decades, research on mutagenic nucleoside analogs has been conducted on compound agents such as ribavirin, 5-fluorouracil, 5-azacytidine, 2'-C-methylcytidine, and T1105 to protect against RNA viruses. T1105, a favipiravir derivative, exhibited antiviral activity at a high dose (200-400 mg/ kg/day) in pigs [26] . It was also reported that pyrimidylthiophene and 2-aminothiazole compounds showed antiviral activity against FMDV-infected cells [9] . Another study reported that ribavirin may be helpful in inhibiting the replication of FMDVs in cells and protecting against their transmission in mice [33] . The antiviral agent interferon alpha (IFN-\uf061) was expressed using a recombinant adenovirus to verify its protective effect against FMDV in pigs [8, 12] . A high concentration of IFN-\uf061 was measured in serum from pigs [6, 19] to verify the effects of the adenovirus. By utilizing IFN-\uf061, IFN-\uf067, and a recombinant adenovirus in combination, inhibition of the replication of FMDV was induced, delaying clinical symptoms [14, 15] . Moreover, protection against FMDV in adult mice using IFN inducers such as polyinosinic (poly C) [28] and CpG [13] has been verified [31] , and it was reported that protection against FMDV was possible in pigs by using IFN combinations [20] . It was also reported that antiviral agents (compounds, IFN, small interfering RNA) were helpful in protecting against FMD [1, 5, 6, 22] . Antiviral agents have emerged to complement the early immunity of vaccines or to replace vaccines when emergency inoculation is required. For such reasons, the development of more appropriate antiviral agents is important for protection against FMD and prevention of its transmission. In particular, one report stated that treatment with ribavirin along with chemical agents provided an excellent inhibitory effect against RNA virus replication in cells [25] and guinea pigs [30] . However, there have been no reports of the ribavirin effect against FMD in pigs.",

The provision of agents absorbed into feed more effectively treated FMD than the oral administration of ribavirin. When the agents were absorbed into feed, there can be almost continuous oral administration, maintaining the in vivo concentration. However, there is a disadvantage in that the agents are administered only when the animals voluntarily consume the feed; thus, a lack of appetite, which may accompany infection with FMDV, may result in lower effectiveness.",

We think that the antiviral agents may be commonly effective in different serotypes. In prior research, guinea pigs were IP inoculated with ribavirin (45 mg/kg) for two weeks, and their survival after exposure to Argentine hemorrhagic fever (Junin virus) was extended from 15 to 25 days; similarly, when the animals were IP inoculated with 60 mg/kg of ribavirin for 25 days their survival was extended from 14 to 37 days [30] . These results show that life extension is possible but the protection is incomplete. In the present study, the measured amount of FMDV in the serum of the mice showed that 15 mg/day of ribavirin may inhibit the replication of FMDVs within approximately 4 days. When the mice were inoculated with agents along with vaccines, or when adjuvants were used, the concentration of ribavirin was reduced to 6 mg/day, resulting in the survival of all adult mice. Considering the research result in which survival rates were heightened when adult mice were inoculated with oil or gel as the adjuvant along with an antiviral reagent, the use of adjuvant with antiviral agents might have extended the antiviral reactivity in the mice. This outcome proves that the dose of the injection, rather than the method of administration, more strongly affects the reagent's protective effect against FMDVs. Assuming that target animals in farms are typically re-infected by FMDVs, a second round of challenge was performed; under those conditions, there was a slight weight change but no change in survival rates. Thus, immunity generated through the first infection may protect against pathogenic re-infection. SP antibodies against FMDV were not detected because virus replication was inhibited by vaccines or ribavirin until day 10. The antiviral agent, ribavirin, helped to delay clinical signs when pigs were challenged with FMDV. The pig group treated with ribavirin and vaccine did not show any clinical signs or measured RNA copy numbers in test swabs. Therefore, we think that ribavirin is an excellent antiviral agent to protect against FMDV, and it can provide early immunity.",
