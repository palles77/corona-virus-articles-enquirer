Over the past years, hand hygiene guidelines have been developed by different agencies at international, national and subnational levels. A comparison of these documents could help in understanding recommendations in different parts of the world and the methods used for their development. Guidelines were identified through search engines, electronic libraries, and personal contacts, and their content was analysed using an adapted version of a tool from the European DG XII-funded HARMONY project. Twenty-two guidelines were retrieved and 21 were evaluated. Documents varied in scope, approach, content and terminology. Some were primarily advisory directives, whereas others focused on the technical issues of why, when, and how to perform hand hygiene. The extent to which evidence was collected and assessed varied considerably and details were provided only in very few. Grading systems and definitions to indicate the strength of evidence and recommendations also differed. The intended outcome was to improve hand hygiene practices in healthcare, thus leading to a reduction of healthcare-associated infections and/or antimicrobial resistance. Although overall agreement on indications and procedures was noted, the range and depth of recommendations on best",

An analysis of recommendations in guidelines produced by 10 countries was published in 2001. 6 However, several guidelines included were not formal publications agreed upon nationally or subnationally and the analysis did not consider many aspects of their development and design that could be useful for the drafting of the WHO guidelines.",

Only three guidelines described clearly the method used for collecting or selecting evidence. 10, 13, 16 Seven national and two subnational guidelines graded the evidence for recommendations (Table I) . 11,13e16,22e24,26 However, different grading systems and definitions were used to indicate the strength of evidence and recommendations (Table I ). The quality of evidence was based on expert consensus in three documents. 11, 15, 22 The grading was performed using the methods adopted by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) for the EPIC (Evidence-based Practice in Infection Control) 2 guidelines. 13 Published guidelines used as references were assessed using the AGREE (Appraisal of Guidelines' Research and Evaluation) instrument in one document. 13 There were additional differences in the individual statements defining the grade hierarchy. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Category 1A is 'strongly recommended for implementation and strongly supported by well-designed experimental, clinical or epidemiological studies', while the France Category 1 is 'strongly supported by well-designed studies and does not pose economical or technical problems'. In the EPIC 2 guidelines, evidence grades 1 and 2 were further classified into three (i.e. 1, 1 \u00fe , and 1 \u00fe\u00fe ). In general, there were three to five grades of evidence and recommendations. The quantum of evidence and details of data from studies presented varied considerably. This probably reflects differences in the evidence-gathering and assessment process. Although the recommendations formulated in most documents were based on expert consensus, the validation process was often unclear. Only seven documents described internal or external peer review and public consultations as methods of validation. 11,13e16,22,24 Several guidelines stated appropriately that there is a need for periodic revision based on new evidence and indeed some were currently being revised (e.g. the French and Belgian guidelines). 10, 14 Based on the original CDC evidencebased guidelines published in 2002, 23 a 'How-to Guide' for hand hygiene was produced by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) a few years later. 30 Four guidelines, 21,24e26 one revised guideline, 13 and the IHI 'How-to Guide' document 30 were published after the publication of the advanced draft of the WHO guidelines (i.e. November 2005 onwards). Interestingly, only three of these six documents referred to the WHO publication. 21, 24, 30 Healthcare workers were the main target population in all guidelines. Since all were national and subnational documents, policy-makers (local authorities, institutional authorities, etc.) were also possible intended users but this was specified only in nine documents. 9,13,16,21,23e26,28 The intended settings were also not specified exactly in most documents. Seven documents mentioned healthcare in community settings in addition to hospitals. 9,21,24e26,28, 29 We surmise that the others are intended to be used primarily for care in hospital settings and, although not specified in many documents, most recommendations appear to relate to inpatient care.",

For example, terms such as 'decontamination' and 'antisepsis' were used synonymously in different documents. The definition of terms used to classify situations where hand hygiene practices are indicated differed between documents. For example, in some cases, 'social' indications meant contacts other than patient care (between HCWs, casual social contact between patient and HCWs, etc.). In others, the same word was used to include all situations where plain soap and water were recommended as the method for hand cleansing, including visible soiling with blood and body fluids. Others did not classify indications, but merely provided lists. In the present evaluation, three types of indications for hand hygiene were considered: social (physical contact unrelated to patient care), patient care and surgical hand preparation. According to this classification, most guidelines appear to have focused on the latter two types of indication. Five guidelines, three national and two subnational, were developed primarily for routine patient care and had only social and routine patient-care indications. 11, 13, 19, 25, 26 Although indications and methods for hand hygiene were the focus for several national and all subnational guidelines, the level of detail described varied considerably. In general, the subnational guidelines tended to have more technical details with more comprehensible illustrations than the national documents which were more advisory in nature. In some documents, the approach was to describe the methods according to indications (e.g. 'before' and 'after' indications and then the appropriate methods) and, in others, the indications for a given method (e.g. all indications requiring hand rubbing) of hand hygiene.",

A few documents listed situations where hand decontamination was not required, including before nursing care or the physical examination of non-immunocompromised patients, before and after short or social contact with non-immunocompromised patients, and after contact with surfaces not suspected of being contaminated. 10e12, 14, 19 Hand washing was the standard for routine patient care in seven documents, 9, 11, 12, 18, 20, 28, 29 and alcohol-based hand rub in seven. 13e15, 19,22e24 Either hand washing or hand rubbing were Contact with patient's intact skin 11 13,14,16,17,19,21,23,24,26e28 End of work shift 9 12,14e16,20,21,25,27,28 Contact with inanimate objects in the immediate vicinity of the patient 7 10, 14, 16, 21, 23, 24, 26 Microbial contamination 5 10, 11, 16, 19, 22 Suspected or proven exposure to spore-forming pathogens 1 23 Contact with items known or suspected to be contaminated 1 25 Using computer keyboard 1 21 Between activities Contact with different patients 9",

For this reason, guidelines defining standardised minimum criteria to ensure the quality of the final document have been issued by WHO. 31 Compared with a previous publication which identified only 10 guidelines on the same topic in 2000, this review covers a considerably higher number of guidelines that include recommendations to define and promote optimal hand hygiene practices during healthcare delivery. 6 The thriving nature of these types of guidelines over the past few years may be due to the increased awareness of the importance of infection control following the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks and the need for preparedness to other potential pandemics. It reflects also the numerous responses to the call for action to improve hand hygiene in healthcare launched in 2005 by the World Alliance for Patient Safety at both inter national and national levels. 4 Despite this main common objective, wide variations in the scope, goals, content, breadth, and depth of topics covered were identified in hand hygiene guidelines. In addition, many documents did not provide a comprehensive coverage of some critical aspects related to proper guideline implementation and sustainability. Lack of uniformity in terminology further compounded analytical differences and often no glossary was provided, thus assuming that a healthcare worker understood the meaning of a certain term. It was not possible to find exhaustive explanations for these differences and deficiencies. Factors related to an often ill-defined, variable target audience, local constraints, and culture and local traditions might have influenced different approaches. If the WHO concept of 'My five moments for hand hygiene' is used as the reference point, the most frequently recommended indications on when to perform hand hygiene are (1) before invasive procedures (2) before patient contact and (3) after body fluid exposure (cited in 18, 16 and 16 guideline documents, respectively). 32 The more neglected moments cited were after patient contact and after contact with inanimate objects in the immediate vicinity of the patient (cited in 10 and 7 documents, respectively). This reflects the well-known lack of awareness that even the environment and patients' intact skin are contaminated by harmful pathogens that can be transmitted through hands. 33, 34 Furthermore, recommendations in some guidelines were formulated in such a way that the healthcare worker had eventually to make his/her own decisions as to when and how to perform hand hygiene. In others, the recommendations were buried or even scattered throughout a large infection control manual. These factors certainly make it more difficult for healthcare workers to determine whether hand hygiene is a high priority and more difficult for policymakers to develop and implement strategies to encourage and sustain hand hygiene improvements nationally or locally. Although we would have liked to analyse the structure and design of the guidelines and how they might have been influenced by their target population, it was often difficult to identify the latter. Most appear to be targeting the healthcare worker, but we could not always determine the setting or the possibility that other stakeholders were influencing the guideline details, such as politicians, policy-makers or even patient advocates.",

            "text": "A general lack of reference to a quality improvement process was noted in many guidelines and mention of validation and audit was often lacking. Actual guideline implementation is a very critical point that strictly depends on effective strategies to translate recommendations into practice and strong and persistent administrative support. Implementation has often been proven deficient, even for high quality and well-recognised guidelines such as those issued by the CDC. 23, 35 According to our review, only nine guidelines mentioned the importance of auditing implementation and/or suggested indicators for measuring related targets at local or national levels. On the other hand, most guidelines recognised that multiple elements were essential for a successful implementation strategy, as repeatedly evidenced in the literature. 36 Interestingly, only three of the six documents post-dated the 2005 advanced draft of the WHO Regular staff training 15 9,11,13,14,16,17,20e26,28,29 Alcohol-based hand rub at the point of care recommended: Wall-mounted dispensers 11 10,14e16,18,21,23,24,26e28 Pocket bottles 3 14, 23, 28 Performance monitoring Direct observation of hand hygiene compliance 9 11, 13, 14, 16, 21, 23, 24, 26, 28 Product consumption 3 13, 16, 23 Tools for audits provided 3 16, 23, 24 Combination of the four elements above 9 11, 13, 14, 16, 21, 23, 24, 26, 28 Reminders 8 16,21,23e28 Feedback 6 11, 13, 14, 21, 23, 24 Administrative sanctions 2 16, 24 guidelines. 5 This may reflect a perception (communicated to B.C.) that as the WHO guidelines were planned to be updated following a rigorous test period, these modifications would be extensive. The final WHO guidelines will be made available in 2009 and will have partly taken on board the above-mentioned concerns and bridged most of the gaps in our knowledge. These guidelines, including their advanced draft, comprise the most extensively referenced and comprehensive document for hand hygiene developed so far. They are intended for use by policy-makers, managers, and healthcare workers in different settings and geographical areas. In many countries, guidelineand policy-developers are already using the advanced draft of the WHO guidelines as a resource for adaptation to local needs and logistics. 5 Guidelines developed by the CDC in 2002 are also used as a reference internationally. 23 Both WHO and CDC guidelines are documents prepared specifically to promote hand hygiene. Both documents reviewed the evidence extensively on a wide variety of topics related to hand hygiene and used a similar grading system. However, while the CDC guidelines are primarily intended for use in the USA and other Western countries, the WHO guidelines were conceived in a more global perspective and represent the challenge to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries, regardless of resources available. For example, instructions are included for the production of alcohol-based hand rubs locally and at low cost. Furthermore, a significant added value of the WHO guidelines is the fact that their feasibility has been tested in settings with different cultural backgrounds 37 and development levels. 38 Although the CDC guidelines were considered as a very valuable framework, the more extensive WHO guidelines explore many innovative issues such as religious and cultural aspects of hand hygiene, promotion of hand hygiene on a national scale, and social marketing, and more attention has been paid to some topics, particularly safety issues, infrastructures required for hand hygiene, and strategies for improvement.",

The regular revision of guidelines is of the utmost importance since the body of evidence is constantly evolving, especially concerning their impact on practices and ultimate patient safety outcomes. Thus, institutions in charge of producing and/or updating hand hygiene guidelines at country level will have the opportunity to take advantage of the regular revision of the WHO guidelines rather than making individual efforts. Furthermore, although the adaptation to the local setting and needs must be prioritised, the reference to an internationally acknowledged guideline can lead to a more standardised and rigorous approach which is currently lacking in most guidelines reviewed here. Indeed, the results of our analyses confirm the lack of uniformity of hand hygiene guidelines worldwide and the urgent need not only for practical and internationally accepted recommendations on many different aspects of hand hygiene, but also for guidance in implementing these recommendations. Despite these differences and the lack of accuracy in some cases, the existence of a growing number of guidelines on hand hygiene, most of which have been issued over the last eight years, represent the acknowledgement by countries of the importance to ensure patient safety and the firm intention to make significant progress in infection control worldwide.",
