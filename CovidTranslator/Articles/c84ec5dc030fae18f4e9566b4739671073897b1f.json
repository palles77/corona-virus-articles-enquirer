TEM enables the resolution and visualization of detail not apparent via light microscopy, even when combined with immunohistochemical analysis. Ultrastructural examination of tissues, cells and microorganisms plays a vital role in diagnostic pathology and biologic research. TEM is used to study the morphology of cells and their organelles, and in the identification and characterization of viruses, bacteria, protozoa and fungi. In this protocol, we present a TEM method for preparing specimens obtained in clinical or research settings, discussing the particular requirements for tissue and cell preparation and analysis, the need for rapid fixation and the possibility of analysis of tissue already fixed in formalin or processed into paraffin blocks. Details of fixation, embedding and how to prepare thin and semi-thin sections, which can be used for analysis complementary to that performed ultimately using TEM, are also described.",

Papers appeared describing progressively better techniques for specimen processing, as the transmission electron microscope became easier to use and more widely available. The transmission electron microscope employs a fine electron beam, created by a high-voltage, electric current-heated tungsten filament, focused by magnetic lenses. The electron beam passes through an ultrathin plastic section whose tissue and cellular components have been post-fixed in osmium and impregnated with the heavy metals uranyl and lead, which impede the beam in proportion to their respective degrees of electron density. The differential transmission of the electrons creates an image that is captured on a fluorescent screen, where it is viewed through a binocular microscope. Once the image is finally focused with the magnetic lenses, the film is exposed or the image is captured with a digital camera.",

Some laboratories, such as ours, have submitted a portion of virtually all biopsy and resection specimens from HIV/AIDS patients for ultrastructural study. As a result, new genera and species of pathogens have been discovered, and knowledge of the ultrastructure of these pathogens has been acquired, rendering their diagnosis at the light microscopic level easier; for example, several new microsporidia were identified and their morphogenesis was revealed [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . The persistence of infectious HIV particles associated with follicular dendritic cells in the germinal centers of hyperplastic lymph nodes from HIV/AIDS patients was an important observation made by TEM, and confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization. The pathology and diagnostic characteristics associated with viruses such as adenovirus, cytomegalovirus and papovavirus have been elucidated using TEM 23, 24 . The human herpesvirus 8 or Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and multicentric Castleman's disease was successfully visualized in Kaposi's sarcoma specimens 25 .",

TEM provides diagnostic criteria: for example, the long, wavy, villous processes of mesothelial cells in mesotheliomas; desmosomes and bundles of cytokeratin of squamous cells in squamous cell carcinoma; the microvillouslined lumina of adenocarcinomas; the inclusion of the alveolar soft parts sarcoma; pre-melanosomes in amelanotic melanomas; Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells in vascular tumors; Reincke crystals of Leydig cell tumors; dense core granules of neuroendocrine tumors; prominent core rootlets of alimentary tract tumors, especially of the colorectum; mitochondria of oncocytomas; and the small clear vesicles of chromophobe tumors of the kidney.",

            "text": "As more and more antibodies have become available, IHC has all but replaced TEM in many surgical pathology departments. In some cases, this has been unfortunate, as markers that have purported to be specific for certain cell types/tumors, in time, turn out to have only a nonspecific association. A prime example is the antibody for neuron-specific enolase, which was heralded as specific for neuroendocrine tumors and is now referred to as 'nonspecific enolase' . As in many cases, one antibody, like neuronspecific enolase, has been replaced by a panel of antibodies, to create statistically more specific diagnostic results. On the other hand, the transmission electron microscope is an excellent tool for identifying the few and the many diagnostic dense core granules in the range of neuroendocrine tumors from small cell to carcinoid, respectively. With increased use of IHC, it has become apparent that there are few magic IHC 'bullets' and panels of IHC stains typically must be used. Interestingly, compared to a panel of IHC stains, TEM often is not only at least as specific, but is also a more economical approach in solving a diagnostic problem. Ultrastructural study can readily determine the type of a poorly or 'undifferentiated' carcinoma and even indicate the primary site of a metastasis. TEM also has an important role in cytopathology. Cells in effusions, like cells in culture, can be readily prepared for TEM. Epithelial cells are easily distinguishable from mesothelial cells. Needle biopsies are particularly good specimens for TEM. Radiographic guidance assures obtaining lesional tissue, minimizes elapsed time between the procedure and immersion in fixative and guarantees optimal preservation. Likewise, fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) are ideal for TEM. They can be optimally fixed by being injected directly into glutaraldehyde and treated as a cell suspension. Of course, if there are fragments of tissue present, they can also be routinely processed.",

Some of these have been empirically derived, while others have been inherited. Our methodology, developed over 30 years of experience, is described here. A little trial and error may be necessary before one optimizes the processing scheme that is best suited for one's own situation. Although glutaraldehyde is the fixative of choice, over time a number of fixatives, for example, paraformaldehyde and a mixture of glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde or formaldehyde, have been proposed for different situations. Another area of considerable variability is the plastic employed for embedding. Our laboratory uses Spurr's to take advantage of its low viscosity and enhanced penetration, whereas others use either Araldite or Epoxy Resin 812. We use propylene oxide for dehydration, whereas others use acetone. Some laboratories, especially core facilities with high workloads, employ one of the various automated processors (e.g., Leica) that are on the market.",

Even worse is when all of the tissue is embedded in paraffin, before one realizes the need for ultrastructural study. However, all is not lost when tissue is fixed first in formalin. Our experience has been that formalin-fixed tissue is more than adequate for quality TEM analysis. The speed of submerging the specimen in fixative and thus the rapidity of fixation are the most critical factors. Actually, formalin penetrates and fixes tissue faster than glutaraldehyde. This explains why when fixing specimens in glutaraldehyde, small pieces of tissue (e.g., no more than 1 mm thick) or thin shavings of tissue are best. Retrieving tissue from paraffin blocks is another story, an unpredictable one. The organic solvents, heating and paraffin itself invariably play havoc with membrane preservation. Fortunately, some diagnostic structures are often still identifiable, for example, intermediate filaments, like cytokeratin, and dense core neuroendocrine granules. With experience, one can even discern mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), mucin vacuoles, glycogen, lipid, desmosomes, lumina and microvilli. Similarly, such information can still be discernable even in degenerating and necrotic tissue/cells. Our proposed protocol for use in these situations is given in Box 1.",

If using option B, C or D, once you have completed the steps, follow option F, the agarose method for preparing cells and FNAs for embedding. (A) Tissue (i) Carefully sample the tissue specimen. The pieces can be small cubes or thin shavings, but should not exceed 1 mm in thickness. They should be totally representative of the specimen. This is especially important when the specimen is variegated in color and texture. Samples from areas with different appearances can be put into either the same or separate bottles of glutaraldehyde. m CRITICAL STEP It is generally important when processing tumors to avoid fat, which appears yellow before osmium post-fixation and black thereafter, and necrotic areas, which will usually be soft and yellowish in color. Also, generally avoid hemorrhagic areas. However, there are situations, for example, bone marrow and tumors of fat cells, where processing fatty tissue is essential. (ii) Start the fixation process as soon as possible after the tissue has been separated from its blood supply (humans and experimental animals) by placing it in a scintillation vial with 5-10 ml of pH 7.2-4 buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde. In our experience, we have found that temperature is not critical and processing on ice is not necessary. Store the fixative at 4 1C and let the fixation continue for at least 1 h at room temperature, before returning the vial to the refrigerator. Process the tissue at room temperature (we usually process only once or twice a week). The buffer can be either cacodylate or phosphate-buffered saline (for example, Sorenson's); we have not found any distinction. m CRITICAL STEP The speed of fixation is critical. Surgical procedures that are prolonged, for example, cystectomy, regularly result in poorly preserved tissue for ultrastructural study. Speed is so important that fixing the tissue in 10% neutral buffered formalin, when glutaraldehyde is not readily available, can suffice and even be equal to glutaraldehyde.

(iv) After all eight blocks have been cut, place the slide on the hot plate (70-90 1C) and allow the drops to evaporate. Leave the slide on the hot plate for a few additional minutes to ensure that the section has adhered to the slide and has flattened out. If the temperature is insufficiently high, the sections will not lie flat on the slide and this will interfere with visualizing by LM. m CRITICAL STEP To prevent sections from wrinkling, ensure the temperature of the hot plate is at least 70 1C. (B) Thin sectioning of plastic blocks (i) Place the block in chuck. Trim the faces of the chosen blocks so that they resemble a trapezoid. Use a new, single-edged razor blade that has been cleaned with acetone to remove oil. Place the block in chuck and mount into the adapter so that the microtome (e.g., Pyramitone) optics can be used to view the block while further trimming. Remove as much unwanted plastic as possible. There is a special trimming device manufactured by Leica Inc. that some might prefer. (ii) Place the trimmed block in the ultramicrotome. Mount the diamond knife in the holder and fill water trough with filtered double-distilled water. m CRITICAL STEP Ensure the knife edge is wet. If necessary, use eyelash probe (eyelash mounted to the end of an applicator stick) to brush water onto the edge. Prepare ultrathin sections (40-60 nm). Sections should appear silvery in color in the water trough. (iii) Expose sections to wisps of chloroform vapor to remove compression wrinkles that occur while sectioning. Dip a cottontipped applicator in chloroform and glide over the sections without touching them. Some claim that chloroform is not necessary when Epon is used. (iv) Before picking up sections with grids, grids must be cleaned. Rinse grids in 2 \u00c2 50% acetic acid and 1\u00c2 acetone (4-5 dips) . Allow grids to dry on filter paper.

One can try increasing infiltration time or more gradually increase the percentage of resin during the infiltration phase. If the soft block represents the only available material, then one can cut away as much of the plastic as possible, and soak the block in sodium ethoxide on a rotator for 24 h at room temperature. Sodium ethoxide is prepared by adding NaOH pellets to ethanol until saturated. The solution is stored overnight before use and can be kept for months. The block is rinsed in four changes of ethanol and then processed as usual. The usual cause of brittle blocks is poor dehydration. Make sure reagents are pure, concentrations are correct and dehydration times are sufficient. Many laboratories use Araldite or Epon because they feel that they are more reliable and easier to use.",

If a precipitate is present before lead citrate staining, then it could be due to contaminated buffer, osmium or fixative. Always limit the exposure of uranyl to light. Figures 1-11 illustrate typical results obtained using this protocol. Figure 1 shows a 'trichrome' stain of a semi-thin plastic section. As shown in Figure 1 , one can expect the 'trichrome' semi-thin plastic section stain to give differential staining similar to paraffin section trichrome and mucin stains. Figure 2 shows the type of result that can be obtained on a specimen initially paraffin embedded and then treated as described in Box 1. This figure illustrates that one can expect that neuroendocrine granules can be visualized by TEM, even though the tissue has been initially embedded in paraffin. Figures 3-12 are photomicrographs of tissue processed by following the standard procedure (option A). They demonstrate that one can expect preservation and visualization of characteristic cellular features, such as keratin (Fig. 3) , endocrine granules (Fig. 4) , surfactant (Fig. 5) , long wavy microvilli (Fig. 6) , glands ( Fig. 9) , core rootlets (Fig. 10) and actin (Fig. 11) , as well as, parasites (Fig. 7) and viruses (Fig. 8) . Figure 3 shows the typical appearance of intermediate filaments (cytokeratin) and junctions in well-preserved tissue. Figure 4 illustrates the diagnostic appearance of insulin granules even in suboptimally preserved tissue. Figure 5 illustrates the diagnostic appearance of laminated surfactant bodies of alveolar type II pneumocytes. Figure 6 shows the diagnostically long microvilli of mesotheliomas. Figure 7 illustrates the ultrastructural features of a Cryptosporidium parasite in the bowel. Figure 8 illustrates typical human herpesvirus group particles. Figure 9 shows typical microvillous-lined glands that define adenocarcinomas. Figure 10 illustrates prominent actin core rootlets characteristic of colorectal cell microvilli. Figure 11 shows the preservation of 70 \u00c5 actin filaments that are characteristic of smooth muscle cells.
