            "text": "NTP-motif, a consensus sequence previously shown to be characteristic of numerous NTPutilizing enzymes, was identified in nonstructural proteins of several groups of positive-strand RNA viruses. These groups include picorna-, alpha-, and coronaviruses infecting animals and como-, poty-, tobamo-, tricorna-, hordei-, and furoviruses of plants, totalling 21 viruses. It has been demonstrated that the viral NTP-motif-containing proteins constitute three distinct families, the sequences within each family being similar to each other at a statistically highly significant level. A lower, but still valid similarity has also been revealed between the families. An overall alignment has been generated, which includes several highly conserved sequence stretches. The two most prominent of the latter contain the socalled \"A\" and \"B\" sites of the NTPmotif, with four of the five invariant amino acid residues observed within these sequences. These observations, taken together with the results of comparative analysis of the positions occupied by respective proteins (domains) in viral multidomain proteins, suggest that all the NTP-motif-containing proteins of positive-strand RNA viruses are homologous, constituting a highly diverged monophyletic group. In this group the \"A\" and \"B\" sites of the NTP-motif are the most conserved sequences and, by inference, should play the principal role in the functioning of the proteins. A hypothesis is proposed that all these proteins possess NTP-binding capacity and possibly NTPase activity, performing some NTP-dependent function in viral RNA replication. The importance of phylogenetic analysis Offprint requests to: A.E. Gorbalenya for the assessment of the significance of the occurrence of the NTP-motif (and of sequence motifs of this sort in general) in proteins is emphasized.",

Because these motifs are short sequence stretches, and usually include amino acid residues frequent in proteins (i.e., Gly, Ala, Ser, and some others), the presence of such a motif in a protein sequence is, as a rule, in itself not statistically significant. Thus, it is important to work out some additional criteria for evaluation of such observations.",

            "text": "One of the most widespread sequence motifs is implicated in an activity crucial to the function of a great variety of proteins, namely purine nucleotide binding followed in most cases by hydrolysis of the 8-3' phosphate bond. This motif was first recognized by Walker and coworkers in several ATP-and GTPutilizing enzymes (Walker et al. 1982; Gay and Walker 1983) . It consists of two separate units designated \"A\" and \"B\" sites; the \"B\" site is located in the polypeptide chains C-proximally relative to the \"A\" site. For the \"A\" site the following consensus sequence was proposed: GXXXXGK-(T) XXXXXXI/V, and the \"B\" consensus was R/K-XXXGXXXL***D, where X stands for any amino acid residue, and * for a hydrophobic residue (Walker et al. 1982) . Results of subsequent analyses of a variety of NTP-utilizing proteins (reviewed by Halliday 1984; M611er and Amons 1985; Doolittle 1986a) suggest much more liberal consensus formulas, namely G/AXXXXGKT/S for the \"A\" site, and an Asp residue preceded by five residues, three of which are hydrophobic, for the \"B\" site. Hereafter we accept these loose definitions for the \"A\" and \"B\" consensus sequences; taken together, they are designated \"NTP-motif.\" In fact, in recent studies, protein sequences were searched for the \"A\" consensus alone as the \"B\" consensus in its loosest form is obviously too degenerate to be unequivocally recognized, except in a family of diverged proteins (see below).",

More specifically, the \"A\" site has been implicated directly in the binding of the pyrophosphate moiety of NTP, whereas the Asp residue of the \"B\" site appears to interact with the magnesium cation complexed with the same phosphate groups (M611er and Amons 1985; Bradley et al. 1987) .

In some of these proteins the presence of this consensus has been independently noticed by other workers too (Argos and Leberman 1985; Doolittle 1986a; Dever et al. 1987; Domier et al. 1987) . Also, the NTP-binding capacity of one of these proteins, p 126 of tobacco mbsaic virus, has been demonstrated experimentally quite independently (Evans et al. 1985) . We proposed that such a capacity should be characteristic of all the NTPmotif-containing proteins of positive-strand RNA viruses. On the other hand, the validity of such predictions in general has been disputed (Argos and Leberman 1985; Doolittle 1986a) .

According to the Sankoff algorithm, a series of cumulative similarity matrices for the compared sequences is created. In the present work, for the calculation of the elements of these matrices, weights of amino acid residue pairs were taken from the mutation rate scoring matrix MDM78 (Staden 1982) . To accelerate calculations, only those elements of the matrices enclosed within a diagonal window, the width of which was chosen to be equal to V5 of the length of the compared sequences, were computed; it has been shown that this window width is sufficient in most cases for generation of the optimal alignment (Pozdnyakov and Pankov 1981) . At the first step of the optimal alignment generation, a series of locally optimal alignments with q = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,qmax gaps was obtained. In practice, for sequence lengths of up to 250 residues dealt with in this work, qm~, was chosen to be equal to 15. This exceeds the gap number most frequently observed in related protein sequences (about four gaps per 100 residues; see Doolittle 1981) and should guarantee the generation of the optimal alignment. For selection of the best of the alignments with a given q value and concomitant assessment of its statistical significance, the following Monte Carlo procedure was employed. Twenty-five pairs of \"random\" sequences were generated by scrambling the real compared sequences, and the above alignment procedure was simulated for each pair. The mean score, Sq ~d and the standard deviation, aq, were calculated separately for alignments with different gap numbers. For each of the locally optimal real alignments, the deviation ofthe observed score from the mean value for the randomized sequences was calculated in SD units: Rezaian et al. 1985 Ahlquist et al. 1984 Cornelissen et al. 1983 Goelet et al. 1982 Strauss et al. 1984 Takkinen 1986 Gustafson and Armour 1986 Bouzoubaa et al. 1986 Bouzoubaa et al. 1987 Boursnell et al. 1987 For picorna-and potyviruses, the numbering of complete polyproteins is indicated; for alphaviruses, the numbering of the nonstructural polyproteins is indicated; for CPMV the numbering of the polyprotein encoded by RNA B is indicated; and for BNYVV RNA 1 the numbering of the entire high-molecular weight product is indicated. The dendrograms were designed to visualize the procedure of multiple sequence alignment in the order of decreasing similarity between proteins; they cannot be automatically regarded as evolutionary trees. For abbreviations of viruses see Table 1 . The values refer to the conserved domains, as indicated in Table 1 , and, for the proteins of the 1 st family, to the N-terminal subdomains.

As is evident from the figure, the significance of the multiple sequence alignments was quite high for each of the families. The families were numbered 1 st, 2nd, and 3rd in order of decreasing sequence divergence between the presently recognized members 9 For part of the proteins constituting the 1st and the 2nd families, analogous sequence comparisons (but with no reference to the NTPmotif) were performed previously by other workers and meaningful similarities have also been observed Goldbach 1986) . Very recently, Domier et al. (1987) compared the sequences of the proteins of the 2rid and the 3rd families and noticed the presence of the \"A\" consensus of the NTP-motif. The I st family includes the NTP-motif-containing proteins (domains) of alpha-, tobamo-, tricorna-, furo-, and coronaviruses as well as the putative product of the hordeivirus RNA ~ open reading frame (ORF) 2, totalling 10 proteins (Table 1) . These proteins vary greatly in their size ( Fig. 2A) , genomic positions of the respective coding sequences, and modes of expression. For the proteins of this family, a statistically significant similarity was observed within a fragment of about 250 amino acid residues ( Fig. 2A) . This fragment contains 21 highly conserved residues (of which 14 are invariant) divided between seven clusters of unequal size (or individual residues). The first and third conserved clusters en-compass the \"A\" and \"B\" sites of the NTP-motif, respectively. The N-proximal five clusters of conserved amino acid residues in these proteins are separated from the sixth and seventh clusters by a variable region of about 60-90 residues. In fact, the conserved domain appears to be further divided into two subdomains, the N-terminal one containing the NTP-motif, and the C-terminal one of totally unknown function. Two specific points are worth noting. First and most remarkably, two segments of the furovirus genome encode two NTP-motif-containing proteins only distantly related (as compared to other members of the family) to each other; this is demonstrated by direct pairwise comparison of their sequences (data not shown). Second, the inclusion of the coronavirus NTP-motif-containing domain within the 1 st family is tentative, as the level of its sequence similarity to the other proteins of this family is not much higher than that between different families (see below). Also, the distance between the \"A\" and \"B\" sites of the NTP-motifis much longer in the coronavirus protein than those in the other proteins of this family. Nevertheless, all the amino acid residues invarianl in the latter are conserved in the coronavirus protein also (see below), justifying its inclusion in this family.",

Presumably, this might be due to different lengths of spacers separating these regions in the proteins of the three families. Thus, an overall alignment has been generated by manual fitting of the computer alignments of the three sets of sequences so as to maximize residue coincidence conserved within individual families (Fig. 3) . In this alignment five amino acid residues are strictly invariant, four additional residues are common to the 2nd and 3rd families, and three residues are conserved in the 1st and 3rd families.

Only two stretches of similar amino acid sequences are common to all viruses analyzed in this study: (1) the conserved region of the RNA polymerase Morozov and Rupasov 1985; Koonin et al. 1987 Koonin et al. , 1988 , and (2) the NTP-motif-containing domain (this paper). Viruses, with proteins that constitute the 2nd and 3rd families characterized above, possess an additional protein sequence of significant similarity, i.e., the proteases of picorna-, como-, and potyviruses Franssen et al. 1984; Carrington and Dougherty 1987; Domier et al. 1987) . In all viruses with nonsegmented genomes (with the probable exception of coronaviruses), in CPMV B polyprotein, and in the furovirus RNA 1 product (p237), the proteins (domains) containing similar sequence stretches are positioned in the same order within multidomain proteins, namely N-NTP-motif-containing domain-(protease)-polymerase-C (Fig. 4) . In coronaviruses the polymerase has not yet been identified. However, the results of our preliminary analysis indicate that the polymerase do- An overall alignment of the evolutionarily conserved segments of the vi~l NTP-moti~containing proteins of the three families. Only partial sequences of the conserved regions (Table 1 ) were aligned; they encompass the N-terminal subdomains of the proteins of the 1 st family, the sequences of the 2nd family without the five N-terminal amino acid residues, and complete sequences of the 3rd family. The residue numbers shown above the alignment are arbitrary; the numbering begins from the first residues of the aligned stretches and includes gaps. The sets of sequences of the three families aligned by the program OPTAL are separated by blank lines. Dots denote conservative positions. These are defined here as positions occupied by similar amino acid residues in at least 50% of the sequences of each of any two of the three families. The upper, middle, and lower rows of dots indicate the conservative positions of the 1st, 2rid, and 3rd families, respectively. Thus, if a given position in the alignment contains dots, say, in the upper and lower rows, this indicates the conservation of residues (in the above sense) between the 1st and 3rd families, and so on. Similar residues are defined as those belonging to one of the following groups: A, V, I, L, M, and F (hydrophobic); F, Y, and W (aromatic); G and A (small); S and T (hydroxy-); K, R, and H (basic); D, E, N, and Q (acidic and their derivatives); C and P have no similar residues. The pattern of highly conserved residues is shown under the aligned sequences, designated \"cons\" for consensus.

(1982) and was subsequently employed for localization of putative catalytic sites and for prediction of NTP-binding capacity in numerous proteins. However, for reasons mentioned in the Introduction, the validity of the whole approach remained rather uncertain. In the present study we demonstrate that in a highly diverged group including similar proteins of positive-strand RNA viruses, the consensus sequences of the NTP-motif constitute the most strictly conserved stretches, encompassing four of the five invariant amino acid residues. Moreover, the NTP-motif-containing domain is one of the two most conserved domains revealed upon an overall comparison of the sequences of this class of virus proteins. This strongly suggests that this protein domain possesses NTP-binding capacity and possibly NTPase activity, presumably supplying some NTP-dependent function(s) that is of vital importance for viral reproduction. This hypothesis is in agreement with the available experimental data implicating these proteins in viral RNA replication and with the reported NTP-binding capacity of TMV p126 (Evans et al. 1985) , although direct testing is certainly warranted. In fact, there is experimental evidence that clearly, though indirectly, demonstrates the importance of the NTP-motif in viral RNA replication, Recently several poliovirus mutants resistant to or dependent on guanidine, a potent inhibitor of RNA replication of some picornaviruses, have been thoroughly studied (Pincus et al. 1986 (Pincus et al. , 1987 . They all mapped to the 2C protein, with the amino acid replacements located in the proximity of the \"A\" and \"B\" sites of the NTPmotif, or near the conserved Asn residue in the 183rd position of the segments of 2C aligned in this paper (Fig. 3) . Dever et al. (1987) have recently proposed a consensus for GTP-binding domains that includes, in addition to the \"A\" and \"B\" sites of the NTP-motif, a third highly conserved sequence element thought to determine the specificity for guanosine. They identified this sequence in the 2C protein of one serotype of FMDV (but not of the other picornaviruses) and suggested that this protein should possess specific GTP-binding capacity, as opposed to other picornaviral 2C proteins. However, it would be unprecedented for proteins so closely related to have different specificities for nucleotides. In our 265 opinion, it is much more likely that, within groups of highly similar NTP-motif-containing proteins such as picornaviral 2C, the substrate specificities and other principal properties should be identical. On the other hand, when considering more distantly related proteins, such as those belonging to the three distinct families described above, one cannot exclude the possibility that such proteins might differ significantly in their activities and functions in viral reproduction.",

            "text": "It seems premature to discuss at length the possible significance of the present observations for understanding the evolution of positive-strand RNA viruses. Two trends, however are obvious. First, NTP-motif-containing proteins are nearly ubiquitous among eukaryotic positive-strand RNA viruses. The existing classification of these viruses (Matthews 1982) includes about 30 families (groups), or somewhat more, taking recent developments into consideration. For 13 of these, complete, or nearly complete genomic sequences are available. Proteins containing the typical NTP-motif were observed in nine families (Table 1 ); in addition, viruses of one family (Flaviviridae) probably possess a functionally related protein with a deviant motif. It is tempting to speculate that an NTP-dependent function supported by the amino acid residues constituting the NTP-motif may be indispensable for positivestrand viral RNA replication; in some cases this function may be supplied by cellular proteins. In this context it is compelling that the RNA replicase of single-stranded RNA bacteriophages contains the translation elongation factor Tu, an NTP-motifcontaining GTPase, as one of its subunits (reviewed by Blumenthal 1979) . Second, it appears that the sequence diversity of the NTP-motif-containing proteins as revealed here does not precisely reflect the \"phenotypic\" diversity of viruses that forms the basis for the existing classification. Of the nine virus families (groups) having NTP-motif-containing proteins, six contribute members to the 1 st family of proteins (see above), two to the 2nd, and one to the 3rd family. Thus, the 1st family covers a very broad range of viral groups differing greatly in their genomic strategies and biological properties. It is anticipated that sequencing ofgenomes of new viral groups will add new members to this family.",

The NTP-motif-containing proteins include a large group of GTPases, namely the RAS family, G proteins, transducins, and some of translation initiation and elongation factors (Dever et al. 1987 and references therein). Also belonging to this class are numerous proteins involved in bacterial DNA synthesis, recombination, and repair, and in membrane transport (Doolittle et al. 1986; Finch et al, 1986a,b; Higgins et al. 1986; Husain et al. 1986; Yin et al. 1986; Gilchrist and Denhardt 1987) , proteins implicated in multidrug resistance in mammalian cells (Chen et al. 1986; Gros et al. 1986) , and several NTP-utilizing enzymes of DNA viruses (Gorbalenya et al. 1985; Anton and Lane 1986; Doolittle 1986a; Astell et al. 1987, and references therein) . From this incomplete list it is obvious that the presence of the NTP-motif brings together numerous proteins with extremely diverse functions. It must be emphasized that many NTP-motif-containing proteins do not bear statistically significant similarity to each other (of. Argos and Leberman 1985; Doolittle 1986a ) and the existence of distinct monophyletic groups of such proteins (excluding very closely related, such as, for example, different RAS species) is not obvious a priori. Nevertheless, the NTP-motif-containing proteins of positive-strand RNA viruses do constitute such a family, whereas the GTPases probably constitute another.",

            "text": "During preparation and reviewing of this manuscript, important relevant information became available. Genome sequences of viruses of three more groups that encode NTP-motif-containing proteins were determined. These are tobacco rattle virus [a tobravirus (Hamilton et al. 1987) ], white clover mosaic virus and potato virus X [two potexviruses (Forstcr et al. 1988; Krayev et al. 1988 )], and tomato black ring virus [a nepovirus (C. Fritsch, personal communication)]. The presumptive NTPbinding domain of the tobravirus is closely related to that of TMV and clearly belongs to the 1 st family of viral NTP-motifocontaining proteins described above. The genomes of potexviruses each encode two NTP-motif-containing proteins. These proteins also beiong to the 1 st family, but their inclusion in the alignment further loosens the consensus. Interestingly, in some positions of the potexvirus proteins, residues otherwise invariant in the 1 st family are replaced by those characteristic of the 2rid family. The nepovirus NTP-motif-containing protein belongs to the 2nd family. Thus, the new data appear to confirm our prediction that sequencing of genomes of viruses belonging to new groups should add members mainly to the 1st family of NTPmotif-containing proteins. Also, the genome sequence of southern bean mosaic virus, a sobemovirus, has been determined (Wu et al. 1987) . The authors claimed that it encoded a presumptive NTPbinding domain. However, a more detailed analysis indicates that this domain probably fulfills an entirely different function, namely the protease one, with its sequence being strikingly similar to those ofpicornaviral proteases (Gorbalenya et al. 1988a ). Thus, sobemoviruses may lack an NTP-motif-conraining protein, which is similar to other positivestrand RNA viruses of small genome size (namely nodaviruses, carnation mottle virus, and RNA phages).",

The three dendrograms depict the order of alignment of sequences within each family of viral proteins. The lengths of the branches are in approximate inverse proportion to the degree of sequence similarity observed at each step of the alignment (with some exceptions). In the nodes of the dendrograms D values for each step expressed in SD units (see Methods) are shown. The values obtained upon alignment of prealigned sets of sequences of the three families with each other are shown in the center of the scheme.",
