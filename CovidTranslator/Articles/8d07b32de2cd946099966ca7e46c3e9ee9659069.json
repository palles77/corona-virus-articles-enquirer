At least in the short-term China has used intensive containment measures successfully as per the findings of the WHO-China Joint Mission Report [8] . This report stated that: \"China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile, and aggressive disease containment effort in history.\" While it is an open question around the generalisability of the Chinese approach to other jurisdictions [9] , there is also evidence of containment success (as of late March 2020) outside mainland China, from Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan [10] . But for European countries currently with thousands of cases, it may be too late to adopt such intensive containment approaches and the best approach may simply be to apply less intense control measures that balance minimising health loss with minimising social and economic disruption (while also putting major resources into rapid vaccine development). Figure 1 shows the scenarios at three different levels of R0 when combined with \"25% general contact reduction\". At R0 = 3.5 the epidemic still peaks during the intervention period whereas for R0 = 2.5 the peak is pushed into the post-intervention period. For R0 = 1.5 the peak is nearly pushed into the subsequent year. Figure 2 again demonstrates the importance of the timing of the intervention period. A higher level of contact reduction (at 50% vs 25%) more effectively suppresses the epidemic in the intervention periodbut when the intervention period ends it causes a higher epidemic peak and a higher total health burden than for the 25% reduction (Table 2) .",

Overall, the levels of health service demand in the more severe scenarios would be completely unprecedented for a modern European country. This is one of the first SEIR modelling studies of this new pandemic disease COVID-19 and the associated online simulation tool has advanced dashboard features and graphic visualisation of results that facilitate user engagement. Nevertheless, there are always limitations with modelling work. Some of these are discussed under issues with parameter uncertainty in Table A1, but here we  note some of the more substantive limitations: \uf0b7 There is still a high degree of uncertainty around many aspects of COVID-19 epidemiology. For example, the value of R0 could conceivably be higher than the highest level in the scenarios we modelled (at R0 = 3.5). Also, the case fatality risk (CFR) could be underestimated, especially if there was health system overload. \uf0b7 The model was deterministic and not stochastic, though we largely offset this issue with modelling a wide range of scenarios. The lack of stochastic considerations mainly translates into increased uncertainty in the very early stages of epidemic spread, which then impacts on the timing of the peak. \uf0b7 The model neither considers any long-term health damage to survivors (especially among risk patients) nor does it consider the hard-to-estimate health loss arising from untreated other health conditions as a result of having an overburdened health system. Likewise we do not consider the additional health harm to the health workers involved e.g., adverse mental health impacts arising from working during a pandemic [13, 14] .",
