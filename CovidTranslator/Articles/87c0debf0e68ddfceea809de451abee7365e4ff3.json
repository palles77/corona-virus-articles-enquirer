This includes antibacterial activity, 1 inhibition of phospholipidase A 2 , 2 inhibition of catechol O-methyltransferase, 3 inhibition of dihydropteroate synthase of Escherichia coli, 4 hypolipidemic activity, 5 cytotoxicity against HeLa cells and the antipicornavirus, 6 neuropeptide Y 1 receptor binding activity, 7 anti-HIV activity, 8 anticholesteremic activity, 9 binding to human muscarinic M 1 and M 2 receptors, 10 histamine H 3 -receptor antagonistic activity, 11 antiprotozoal activity, 12 binding to neuroblastoma cells, 13 binding to the human cannabinoid CB 1 receptor, 14 and inhibition of the main protease of the recombinant SARS coronavirus. 15 Diaryl sulfones are available by oxidation of diaryl sulfides. For example, 4-(phenylsulfonyl)anisole has been prepared by oxidation of 4-(phenylthio)anisole with hydrogen peroxide. 16 An alternative approach to this compound relies on the aluminum(III)chloride-mediated reaction of anisole with phenylsulfonic acid chloride. 17 However, this approach suffers from the formation of a regioisomeric mixture, which is difficult to be separated. The reaction of phenol with benzenesulfonic acid has been reported to give 4-(phenylsulfonyl)phenol. 18 However, no yield was given, and the reaction required harsh conditions (240\u00b0C). Recently, an efficient approach to 4-(phenylsulfonyl)phenol, based on the CuI/proline-mediated reaction of aryl iodides with sodium benzenesulfinate, has been reported. 19 4-(Phenylsulfonyl)anisole has been prepared by Suzuki reaction of 4-methoxybenzeneboronic acid with phenylsulfonic acid chloride. 20 Recently, its synthesis by Cu(OAc) 2 -catalyzed reaction of 4-methoxybenzeneboronic acid with sodium benzenesulfinate in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline and oxygen has been reported. 21 All of these reactions rely on the coupling of two arene moieties. The application of these reactions to the synthesis of sterically encumbered or functionalized products can be difficult in some cases. In addition, the synthesis of the required starting materials, functionalized arenes, can be a tedious task.",
