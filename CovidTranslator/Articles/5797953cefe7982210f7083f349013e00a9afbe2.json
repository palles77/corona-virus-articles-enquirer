Tackling these diseases effectively requires an integrated multi-sectoral approach that links chemotherapy with prevention initiatives such as improved water supply, sanitation and hygiene, vaccines and vector control. Various governmental and non-governmental organizations, charities, foundations, product-development partnerships, academic groups and pharmaceutical companies are supporting drug discovery for tropical diseases. A breakdown of funding is summarized in the G-Finder 6 and IFPMA 2017 7 reports. In 2016 about two-thirds of the total funding for research and development for neglected diseases was spent on HIV/AIDS (34%), malaria (18%) and tuberculosis (18%) 6 . Overall research and development funding has markedly increased in the last decade but the gains have not been distributed evenly across diseases. Greater efforts, resources and funding are urgently needed to meet the considerable unmet medical needs.",

There are very few well-validated molecular drug targets for tropical diseases, in part owing to a lack of understanding of the detailed biology of many of the pathogens. For example, the functions of many proteins are unknown, or have only been inferred from other organisms. Therefore a key challenge is the selection of a suitable molecular target to limit the risk of subsequent failure 8 . Criteria used to help to select appropriate targets include essentiality, druggability, assayability and the opportunity for selectivity over host orthologues 8 . Even if a target complies with all these criteria, inhibitors frequently fail to demonstrate cell-based activity owing to poor permeability, inability to compete with high substrate concentrations in cells, or because the compounds cannot inhibit the target sufficiently to kill the pathogen. The deficiency of genetic tools for many disease-relevant organisms is a key reason why so little essentiality data are available. However, new techno logies are emerging [14] [15] [16] , including CRISPR-Cas9 17, 18 , which offer the prospect of markedly increasing the number of validated targets available in the near future.",

Developing assays that have sufficient throughput to allow screening of compound libraries while maintaining relevance to disease pathophysiology is challenging, but helps to reduce attrition when using in vivo models and, ultimately, in clinical trials 21 . As assays increase in relevance, they usually become more complex and require more resources, both in terms of specialist equipment as well as staff to develop and run the assays. Other challenges may include the lack of robust in vitro culture systems (for example, for Cryptosporidium), the inherent safety challenges of handling disease-causing agents in bulk, the lack of standardization between different laboratories working on the same organisms, and the use of laboratory strains and cell lines rather than recent clinical isolates and primary cells 21, 22 .",

Plasmodium falciparum, the pathogen that causes the most severe form of human malaria, does not infect rodents normally; however, a SCID mouse model has been developed that can be infected by P. falciparum 23 . Work is also ongoing to develop a mouse model of human malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax 24 .

Diarrhoea is a major problem among children, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths per year. The Global Enteric Multicentre Study (GEMS), a case-control study conducted at seven sites in Africa and south Asia, is the most comprehensive study of childhood diarrhoea to date 112, 113 . The most common pathogens found in this study were Shigella spp., rotavirus, adenovirus 40/41, heat-stable enterotoxin-producing Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium spp. and Campylobacter spp. In some cases, mixed infections were an issue. Some tropical diseases, such as cryptosporidiosis, schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths 114, 115 , are associated with malnutrition, growth stunting and impaired cognitive development in children.

Having penetrated to the cytoplasm, the drug then risks being pumped out of the bacteria through efflux transporters. Pathogens such as T. cruzi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and viruses spend the majority of their life cycle inside human host cells, which can impede drug access. Some pathogens localize to extreme intracellular environments such as acidic organelles (for example, Leishmania spp. or Salmonella spp.) or necrotic granulomas (for example, M. tuberculosis). In the latter case, it is a major challenge to design drugs that can penetrate through the non-vascularized lipid-rich caseum to access the pathogen 34 . Other infections are localized at sites that are protected by a blood-tissue barrier, such as the central nervous system (for example, HAT, Cryptococcus neoformans, Taenia solium, or encephalitis-or meningitis-causing viruses or bacteria) or the eyes (for example, C. trachomatis).

Africa bears a disproportionately high share of the burden with more than 400,000 deaths a year. Multiple new types of antimalarial drugs are needed to overcome resistance, give single-dose treatments, prevent relapse of P. vivax infections, block transmission and to act as chemopreventatives. The malaria drug-discovery portfolio has markedly improved over the past decade 41 . The starting points for the majority of the compounds currently in development were identified by phenotypic screening in collaborations with MMV. In many cases, target deconvolution has subsequently led to the identification of the molecular targets. There are a number of novel compounds in clinical trials supported by or in collaboration with MMV (Fig. 3) . The following are derived from phenotypic screens and are in phase II trials: the spiroindolone KAE609, the imidazolopiperazine KAF156 42 (a combination trial with lumefantrine), the synthetic trioxolane artefenomel (OZ439, in combination with ferroquine) 43 and the 2aminopyridine MMV048. The mode of action has been determined for some of these (P. falciparum (Pf) ATP4 for KAE609 44 and PfPI4K for MMV048 45 ) , whereas the modes of action of KAF156 and OZ439 remain uncertain. KAF156 has been linked to the cyclic amine resistance locus (Pfcarl) 46 and OZ439 probably acts through formation of carbon radicals, whereas ferroquine acts to prevent haem detoxification. In phase I trials are: the dihydroisoquinoline SJ733, another PfATP4 inhibitor 47 ; and M5717, which is active against translation elongation factor 2 48 . Two compounds derived from target-based projects are also in clinical trials: the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor DSM265 49 is in phase II trials, and the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor P218 is in phase I trials.",

Mortality rates for HAT (also known as sleeping sickness) have decreased substantially in recent years 61 ; however, there is still a considerable disease burden in central Africa. The advent of nifurtimox-eflornithine (NECT) combination therapy in 2009 marked an important step in the treatment of stage two T. brucei gambiense HAT. This has reduced the duration of treatment as well as decreasing adverse effects 62 . Nevertheless, treatment is still problematic because the two subspecies that cause the disease (T. brucei gambiense and T. brucei rhodesiense) and the two stages (acute and central nervous system) require different drugs 61 . The requirement for staging patients before treatment also limits uptake, as it involves a painful and technically challenging lumbar puncture 63 . The ongoing development of two new drugs has the potential to transform the clinical management of HAT 64 . The first of these drugs is fexinidazole, a nitroaromatic compound developed in the 1970s and 1980s as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which was more recently found to have a suitable profile for clinical development for HAT 65 . Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) completed a phase III clinical trial in 2017 and reported non-inferiority over NECT for both stages of the disease with a ten-day oral treatment 66 . The second is an oxaborole compound, SCYX-7158 (acoziborole) 67 , which is currently undergoing a pivotal phase II/III trial 10 . This has the potential to provide a single-dose oral treatment for all forms of HAT.",

However, current drugs are less effective or unsuitable in other areas of the world. New oral drugs are urgently needed to treat VL in these regions and to provide improved treatment options in the Indian subcontinent. Furthermore, HIV-VL co-infection is also currently poorly treated. Several potential oral treatments identified through phenotypic screening are in preclinical development, including an oxaborole and a nitroimidazole 69 . The discovery of a pan-kinetoplastid proteasome inhibitor 70 (GNF6702, Fig. 3 ) offers potential for development of new drugs for leishmaniasis, Chagas disease and HAT. The majority of preclinical work on leishmaniasis focuses on VL, the deadly form of the disease, rather than cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). New oral therapies for CL are urgently needed as well. Research on Chagas disease suffered a setback recently as a consequence of the clinical failures of the CYP51 inhibitors posaconazole and fosravuconazole 71, 72 .

Effective treatments for HIV and HCV have been developed 73, 74 . Other viruses, including flaviviruses, arenaviruses, coronaviruses and filoviruses still pose a considerable threat for tropical countries and others, and pose a particular risk of global pandemics, as exemplified by the recent outbreaks of Zika 75 , chikungunya 76 , dengue 77 , Ebola 78 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) 79 . Since future epidemics are almost inevitable, and could be triggered by any member of these families, drug-discovery efforts rightly focus on broad-acting antivirals 80 . These diseases have received relatively little attention in terms of small-molecule drug discovery. However, both target-based and cellbased hit discovery approaches have yielded new compounds of interest, but to date none of these have been developed to a similar degree as the HCV and HIV drugs 80 . The most advanced compounds are favipiravir, GS-5734 (remdesivir) and BCX4430 (galidesivir), which target the viral polymerase (Fig. 3) . Favipiravir was tested in humans during the Ebola virus epidemic of 2014. Although conditions complicated the study, it was concluded that further investigation was warranted 81 . GS-5734 has shown activity in rhesus monkey model of Ebola 82 , and was also used in humans during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. It is currently undergoing a phase II clinical trial in West Africa. Both favipiravir and GS-5734 are being considered for use in the 2018 Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 83 . BCX4430 has demonstrated complete protection against Marburg virus in non-human primates and against Ebola in rodent models when administered within 48 h of infection. This compound also shows broad activity against other viruses, including arenaviruses and flaviviruses 84, 85 , and is currently in clinical development. Inhibitors that target the viral protease are not as far advanced (with the exception of HIV and HCV); however, they also show promise as broad-spectrum antivirals. The potential of targeting host pathways is also being explored 80, 86 . Although new small-molecule antivirals are being discovered, there is an urgent need to translate more such treatments into the clinic, alongside ongoing vaccine development.",

Nevertheless, the only new antihelminthic drug to emerge in the last 30 years is tribendimidine, which shows promising broad-spectrum activity. Recent clinical trials show that it is a suitable alternative for the benzimidazoles and praziquantel in various helminth infections [100] [101] [102] . Beyond this, development of new treatments is focused on repurposing drugs. This has mostly involved anthelminthics that are approved for veterinary use. Oxantel pamoate, a licensed veterinary drug since 1974, has shown promising efficacy in human clinical trials for trichuriasis (whipworm), one of the more difficult-to-treat soil-transmitted helminths 103 , and in combination with albendazole and pyrantel pamoate, it has recently demonstrated high clinical efficacy against hookworm infections 104 . Two other veterinary drugs, emodepside and moxidectin, show promising activity against several human helminths, and are currently undergoing clinical trials for onchocerciasis 69, 105 . Some antimalarial compounds show activity against schistosomes in vitro and in vivo. Mefloquine-praziquantel and mefloquine-artesunate-praziquantel combinations were tested in clinical trials against chronic Schistosoma haematobium infection. Unfortunately, adverse event rates were high and there was no increased efficacy compared to praziquantel 106 . In the case of filarial worms, an alternative strategy is targeting of the Wolbachia endosymbiotic bacteria; this results in slow killing of the worms, thereby avoiding serious adverse events. For example, four weeks of treatment with doxycycline cured people suffering from onchocerciasis. The major aim of Wolbachia-directed therapy is to find shorter-course antibiotics 107 . Several high-throughput phenotypic screens have been carried out to discover new chemical entities that act against helminth infections 108, 109 , but no new clinical candidates have been reported to date.",

However, recent progress in drug discovery in human African trypanosomiasis, tuberculosis and malaria show that headway can be made with the concerted efforts of governments, charities, foundations, product-development partnerships, academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies. There is still a long way to go, even in these disease areas. The high attrition rate in clinical trials and issues of resistance mean that there is no room for complacency. Further, multiple new agents are required for each disease area to allow combination therapies. While there has been progress in some disease areas, there is much less support and activity in others.",
