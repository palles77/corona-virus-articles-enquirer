Our previous observation revealed a partial relief of lung fibrosis in patients suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We hypothesize that Cordyceps has beneficial effects on lung fibrosis and the objective of this study is to explore the target(s) of Cordyceps in the relief of lung fibrosis in animal and cell models and to gain insight into its underlying mechanisms. Material and methods: A rat model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis and a fibrotic cell model with transforming growth factor beta-1 induction were employed in the studies. Results: Reduction of infiltration of inflammatory cells, deposition of fibroblastic loci and collagen, formation of reactive oxygen species, and production of cytokines, as well as recovery from imbalance of MMP-9/TIMP-1, were observed in fibrotic rats after treatment with Cordyceps in preventive (from the day of BLM administration) and therapeutic (from 14 days after BLM) regimens. In a fibrotic cell model with transforming growth factor beta-1 induction, the human lung epithelial A549 acquired a mesenchymal phenotype and an increase of vimentin expression with a concomitant decrease of E-cadherin. This epithelial-mesenchymal transition could be partially reverted by cordycepin, a major component of Cordyceps. Conclusion: The findings provide an insight into the preventive and therapeutic potentials of Cordyceps for the treatment of lung fibrosis.",

It is characterized by transdifferentiation of the epithelial cells, accumulation of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, formation of fibroblastic foci, and distortion of the lung architecture (Antoniou et al., 2007) . The change of epithelial cobblestone-like morphology to myofibroblast phenotype through epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), and the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin with a concomitant disruption of E-cadherin junction are the hallmarks for IPF. Many patients, however, show little evidence of inflammation, and anti-inflammatory treatments have little impact on the disease (Willis et al., 2006) .",

A renowned Chinese medicine to soothe the lung, CS is now often used for the treatment of respiratory diseases and strengthening immune responses. It has also been reported to be an antioxidant and an inhibitor of angiogenesis. Cordyceps extracts have been shown to relieve fibrosis in the liver (Das et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 1998a Zhu et al., , 1998b , kidney (Chai et al., 2009) , and lung (Wang et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2011) through an inhibition of TGF-b1 expression (Wang et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2011) and promotion of collagen degradation (Li et al., 2006a) . The dried form of CS contains ergosterol, polysaccharides, glycoprotein and peptides. Adenosine and cordycepin (3 0 -deoxyadenosine) are the major components (Li et al., 2006b; Tsai et al., 2010) and they have been demonstrated to modulate cell activation and alter cell morphology (Shin et al., 2009) . Several therapeutic strategies targeting various stages of fibrogenesis are being investigated (Selman et al., 2011) , and it is the objective of the present study to explore the target(s) of CS in the relief of lung fibrosis and to gain insight into its underlying mechanisms.",

            "text": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, irreversible and debilitating lung disease with fibroblast expansion and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix in the interstitium that causes breathing difficulty. There are more than 5 million people worldwide suffering from this disease, but all current treatments are not effective, and patients usually die from this lung disorder within 3 years of diagnosis (Antoniou et al., 2007) . C. sinensis (Dong-Chong-Xia-Cao) is a folk medicine in China to soothe the lung for the treatment of fatigue and respiratory diseases, as well as modulation of immune response, redox balance, inhibition of angiogenesis and the relief of liver fibrosis. Clinically a partial relief of lung fibrosis has been achieved in patients suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Hui and Chan, 2006) . As a continuous study on the protective/therapeutic mechanisms of Cordyceps against lung fibrosis, we analyzed the morphological changes of lung tissues and the expression of fibrogenic factors in a rat model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in order to gain insight into the treatment of this hampering disease. Total RNA was isolated from lung tissues of untreated and BLM-treated rats, and reverse transcribed into cDNA for PCR using Taqman probes for MMP-9, TGFb-1 and TIMP-1 genes (n \u00bc6). Increase of fibrotic gene transcription, including TIMP-1, procollagen I, TGF-b1, and MMP-9, in lung tissues from BLM-treated rats, but the transcripts returned to normal levels after time-course CS2 treatments. Lung fibrosis is characterized by abnormal proliferation of alveolar mesenchymal cells, e.g. myofibroblasts, and activation of inflammatory cells, e.g. neutrophils and macrophages (Chaudhary et al., 2006; Dunkern et al., 2007) . All these cells under stress produce TGF-b1 which activates characteristic accumulation of matrix proteins, mainly type I collagen and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in IPF or in animal models of BLM-induced fibrosis (Cutroneo et al., 2007) . MMPs are a family of ECM degrading enzymes from inflammatory cells which play important roles in inflammation and tissue remodeling (Yoshimura et al., 2006) . MMP-9, a member of the MMP family commonly associated with IPF, binds non-covalently to its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), in a 1:1 M ratio. About 2-fold increase of TGF-b1 and TIMP-1, and 5.8-fold increase of MMP-9 were found in lung tissues of BLM-rats, making MMP-9/TIMP-1 imbalance and accumulation of alveolar ECM commonly found in human fibrotic lungs (Kelly and Jarjour, 2003; Yoshimura et al., 2006) . An increase in MMP/TIMP favors tissue injury, while the reverse may be associated with anti-fibrosis (Kelly and Jarjour, 2003) . The quantitative RT-PCR was only performed in Experiment 2, in which lung fibrosis is alleviated at a decrease of MMP-9/ TIMP-1 in a time-independent manner as shown in all CS treatment groups. It is, however, noteworthy that MMP-9 transcription was suppressed to a greater extent than that of TIMP-1, resulting in a significant reduction of MMP-9/TIMP-1 imbalance (from 5.8 to around 1.6-1.8 for all CS treatment groups), and thus attenuating the fibrotic injury of the BLM-rats in Experiment 2.",

Although antioxidative activity was demonstrated in Cordyceps, it is, however, unlikely the cause for its antifibrotic activity (Yu et al., 2006) because even N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a strong oxidant scavenger, can only slightly alleviate fibrogenesis when it is prescribed in association with corticosteroid for this incurable lung disease (Cottin and Cordier, 2008; Moeller et al., 2008) .

In those studies, Cordyceps was given orally in either suspension or aqueous extract (Nan et al., 2001; Won and Park, 2005) , ranging from 0.3 g/kg/day for 9 weeks (Liu et al., 2003) to 0.66 g/kg/day for two weeks (Wang et al., 2007) . We have also demonstrated a partial relief of lung fibrosis in patients suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) following an oral administration of C. sinensis powder at 0.27 g/day for 12 weeks (Hui and Chan, 2006) . C. sinensis is the authentic Dong Chong Xia Cao, but other species, e.g., C. militaris, and C. martialis are occasionally used as substitutes because of their similar biological activities (Li et al., 2006b) and lower market values. Interestingly, similar antifibrotic results, including decreased production of TGF-b1 and collagen, and restoration of MMP/TIMP imbalance, were claimed in the treatment of liver or lung fibrosis with extracts from different Cordyceps species (i.e., C. sinensis or C. militaris) (Liu and Shen, 2003; Nan et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2007, Won and Park, 2005; Xu et al., 2011) .

Similar conclusion was recently made by Xu et al. (2011) , who showed a decrease in TGF-b1 by cultured CS. The significance of the present study is perhaps the finding of alleviation of lung fibrosis after the fibrosis had developed (Experiment 2). The results of inhibition of critical fibrosis mediator (TGF-b1), reduction of leukocyte infiltration and collagen production, and the recovery from imbalance of tissue degradation and remodeling (MMP-9/TIMP-1) do not show significant difference among groups of CS treatments for 14, 21 and 28 day. These results implicate both preventive and therapeutic potential of CS in the rat model of lung fibrosis induced by BLM (H\u00fcbner et al., 2008) . Further studies are required to identify active components in Cordyceps responsible for its antifibrogenic mechanisms.",

These cells lose their cell-cell junctional protein, E-cadherin, and express mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA). EMT is thus critical to the development and progression of fibrosis, and its inhibition is considered a chemotherapeutic target for fibrosis. A preliminary study did show reverted EMT by cordycepin at 80 mM but not by crude Cordyceps extract in cultured A549 cells in the present study, probably attributed to relatively low level of cordycepin (40-60 mg/g) and high cytotoxicity of other ingredients in the crude Cordyceps extract (unpublished data). A combined pharmacokinetic and pharmacological analysis of Cordyceps extract or its active ingredients (e.g., cordycepin, adenosine and others) in the prevention of EMT may provide an insight into the antifibrogenic properties of Cordyceps.",

Scientific research in laboratories and clinical screening for therapeutic agents targeting these factors are extensively studied globally (Moeller et al., 2008) . It is interesting to find that CS not only down-regulates pro-fibrotic factors, such as TGF-b1 and MMP-9, in the present study, but also suppresses soluble IL-2R (Hui and Chan, 2006) , VEGF, inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a and IFN-g) (Li et al., 2006a) , and anti-apoptotic activity (Shahed et al., 2001) .

The changes were reversed (133% and 119% for vimentin and E-cadherin, respectively) by 80 mM cordycepin (C) but not by 8 mg/mL Cordyceps extract (CE) (152% and 2% for vimentin and E-cadherin, respectively). No significant change in expression of vimentin (103%) and E-cadherin (99%) in CE group was compared with those of untreated controls (CTL) (100% for both vimentin and E-cadherin). Hydroxyproline assessment as a measure of collagen deposition in lungs from sham control, bleomycin treatment, and bleomycin treatment with CS2 for 14, 21 and 28 days. Cordyceps extracts significantly (***po 0.05) alleviated collagen deposition in all CS2 treatment groups comparing to the BLM-treated group. Data are presented as mean and standard deviation of 8 samples (n\u00bc 8).",
