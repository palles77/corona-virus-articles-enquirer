A variety of animal models of cardiac disease have been developed to better understand the etiology, cellular and molecular mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction and novel therapeutic strategies. The animal models have included large animals (e.g. pig and dog) and small rodents (e.g. mouse and rat) and the advantages of genetic manipulation in mice have appropriately encouraged the development of novel mouse models of cardiac disease. However, there are major differences between rodent and human hearts that raise cautions about the extrapolation of results from mouse to human. The rabbit is a medium-sized animal that has many cellular and molecular characteristics very much like human, and is a practical alternative to larger mammals. Numerous rabbit models of cardiac disease are discussed, including pressure or volume overload, ischemia, rapid-pacing, doxorubicin, drug-induced arrhythmias, transgenesis and infection.",

Moreover, larger animal hearts have physical dimensions more like human hearts, and this larger size may be crucial for some arrhythmogenic mechanisms.

At the same time, many 'adult human scale' interventions have been or are being scaled down for pediatric use and assessment (e.g. pacemakers and CRT) so that rabbit models can be beneficial (see below). Surgical interventions are still easier than microsurgical approaches in rodents.

This is particularly relevant for the studies of heart failure (HF) and arrhythmias because alterations in ion channel and Ca 2+ transporter function or expression are thought to contribute directly to depressed contractile performance and arrhythmogenesis [2, 3] . In particular, mouse and rat ventricular action potentials (APs) have very short duration and completely lack the prominent AP plateau phase typical of human, rabbit and most mammals larger than that of rat (Fig. 1D) . Furthermore, the main ionic currents underlying repolarization and which greatly influence AP duration (APD) are the same in human and rabbit (delayed rectifier K + currents I Kr and I Ks ). These channels are not present in mouse or rat, where APD is dictated almost entirely by transient outward currents (I to ). I to is present in human and rabbit ventricle, but plays only a minor role in APD in human and rabbit. Notably, the electrophysiological characteristics and secondary regulation of I to versus I Kr and I Ks are completely different, making this much more than a quantitative difference.",

However, in human and rabbit ventricular myocytes a considerably larger fraction of activating Ca 2+ comes via Ca 2+ entry, and the same amount is extruded at each beat by the electrogenic Na/Ca exchange [1] . Under control conditions in rabbit and human this is 24-30% of the Ca 2+ involved in excitation-contraction coupling, and in HF the SR and trans-sarcolemmal cycling can be nearly equal (Fig. 1B ,C; [4] [5] [6] ). Because changes in SR Ca 2+ content and ] i decline in normal adult rabbit and rat ventricular myocytes, on the basis of quantitative analysis of Ca 2+ removal fluxes by the SR Ca-ATPase (SR) Na/Ca exchange (NCX) and the combined slow action of the plasma membrane Ca-ATPase (SL Ca-ATPase) and mitochondrial uniporter (Mito; on the basis of data in Bassani et al.

There are some differences in coronary anatomy between rabbits and other species. The collateral circulation is not as extensive as it is in the canine heart, and the circumflex supplies most of the LV free wall and is more dominant than the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery [22, 23] . As such, the occlusion of the marginal branch of the circumflex coronary artery is often used for MI induction, and leads to mild to moderate degrees of HF, with LV ejection fractions in the range of 40-50%, but in some studies EFs were as low as 27% [23, 24] . MIs are characterized by increased LV enddiastolic dimension and increased left atrial size, similar to that found in LAD infarcts in other species. There are significant alterations in b-adrenergic receptor (b-AR) signaling including global reduction in b-AR density, reduced b-AR coupling and increased protein levels and activity of bARK1 and G i [25] . There is regional heterogeneity of intracellular Ca 2+ handling [23] and impaired synchronization of Ca 2+ release events throughout the myocytes [26] . In addition to chronic occlusion, a rabbit model of myocardial ischemia followed by reperfusion has been used [27] . Moreover, other rabbit MI models include intracoronary microsphere embolization [28] (similar to a wellestablished intracoronary microembolization model in dog) [29] , and direct current-shock-induced cardiac muscle injury [30] .",

However, cardiotoxicity is a major clinical problem, and its cumulative toxicity on myocardium prevents their use at maximum doses that would be needed for optimal treatment [36] . Progressive reduction in ejection fraction is seen during the course of therapy, and life threatening CHF is observed in 10% of patients receiving more than 550 mg/m 2 . This has prompted studies in experimental models. Adriamycin has been used experimentally to induce cardiomyopathy in rabbits [37] [38] [39] . This model has been useful in identifying cardioprotective agents that could limit adriamycin toxicity. It has also been useful as a model of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with severe cardiac dilatation, LV hypertrophy, and decreased LV systolic function that is progressive and irreversible, accompanied by fluid retention and activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin systems [37] . However, there is no evidence of b-adrenergic receptor downregulation as occurs in advanced human HF [40] . Cardiotoxicity is due to free radical formation and lipid peroxidation that ultimately alters lysosomes, mitochondria, SR and the sarcolemmal membrane. These changes result in the activation of hydrolytic enzymes, calcium overload and reduced energy production [41] . Pathologic changes including cytosolic vacuolization and myofibrillar loss are typical of adriamycin cardiotoxicity in patients, but are different from those observed in other forms of nonischemic HF in humans (e.g. idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM), long-standing hypertension or valvular heart disease). Other limitations include the variable degree of LV dysfunction produced, undesirable bone marrow and GI toxicity.",

Tachycardia-induced HF has been described in patients with long-standing tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response. As such, rapid pacing (whether ventricular or atrial) has been used to induce HF in several speciesmost commonly dog, but also pig and rabbit [43] . Rapid ventricular pacing in the rabbit induces HF characterized by cardiac enlargement, systolic dysfunction and ventricular myocytes exhibiting contractile dysfunction. The intermediate size of the rabbit allows implantation of standard human pacemakers. Because the intrinsic heart rates of rabbits are in the range of 220-280 beats/min, pacing to rates in the range of 340-400 beats/min are required [44] [45] [46] . HF develops over the course of two to five weeks and is characterized by dyspnea, appetite loss and body weight loss. Chronic pacing leads to progressive, predictable and time-dependent reduction in LV systolic function and geometry [44] , which allow the study of molecular and cellular events during the development of chronic HF. Development of HF is associated with reduced responsiveness to inotropic stimulus, decreased myocyte contractility, and neurohumoral activation [44, 47] . There are changes in Ca 2+ homeostatic mechanisms consistent with human HF, including decreases in Ca transient amplitude, L-type Ca 2+ channel activity and SERCA expression. However, Yao et al. report decreased Na/Ca exchange current in pacing HF rabbits [45] in contrast to studies in canine pacing HF showing enhanced NCX activity when [Ca 2+ ] i was minimally buffered [48] . As with pacing HF models in other species, LV systolic function returns to normal within approximately one week following cessation of pacing, although adenyl cyclase response to agonists takes two weeks, and b-adrenergic receptor density takes four weeks to return to normal [46] . Moreover, the LV dilatation and dysfunction is not associated with myocardial or cellular hypertrophy [44] , so the changes in LV myocardial structure are not similar to those of clinical HF in humans caused by ischemic or hypertensive heart disease. The model has nonetheless provided important information regarding the pathophysiology of the failing heart including electrical remodeling [49] , abnormal intracellular Ca 2+ cycling [50] and exercise training in HF [51] .",

We have demonstrated that HF rabbits exhibit severely depressed LV function with LVH (75% increase in HW/BW), spontaneously occurring VT that initiates by a nonreentrant mechanism such as triggered activity, and a 10% incidence of sudden death [5, 53, 54] . We also showed that HF rabbit myocytes exhibit contractile dysfunction from decreased SR Ca load that is associated with altered intracellular Ca handling (\"NCX, #RyR and preserved SERCA); preserved b-AR responsiveness with enhanced b 2 -AR responsiveness; decrease in ion currents (I to , I K1 and I Ks ); activation (by catecholamines) of a transient inward current I ti that can initiate delayed after depolarizations (DADs); downregulation and dephosphorylation of the main ventricular gap junctional protein connexin43 (Cx43) increased the expression and activation of CaMKII and increased RyR phosphorylation and SR Ca 2+ leak [3, 5, 53, 55, 56] . Many of these findings have been validated by focused studies in failing human hearts including 3D mapping studies showing focal nonreentrant mechanisms underlying VT in patients with nonischemic HF, NCX upregulation with preserved SERCA in a large subset of human HF patients, enhanced b 2 -adrenergic responsiveness in failing human cardiac myocytes [53, 57, 58] , and Cx43 downregulation and dephosphorylation in human HF (both ischemic and nonischemic) [55] . Other studies with this HF model have demonstrated additional insights into arrhythmogenesis [59] , sinus node dysfunction in HF [60] and the effects of acute ischemia superimposed on chronic HF [61] . Thus, findings in these models have provided important new insights into human HF. While this arrhythmogenic rabbit model of nonischemic HF is technically challenging and takes months to develop, the similarities of rabbit myocardium to human myocardium and validating studies in humans indicate that this model provides important insights into the contractile dysfunction and arrhythmogenicity of the failing heart.",

TdP had been difficult to model in experimental animals, and mouse and rat which lack an AP plateau and I Kr are less useful animal models in this arena. Carlsson et al. [62] first developed an in vivo model of TdP in the anesthetized aadrenoreceptor (a-AR)-stimulated rabbit (methoxamine plus the Class III antiarrhythmic clofilium). This model has been used extensively by several groups with minor modification [62] [63] [64] to test for drug-induced TdP, to understand the underlying electrophysiological mechanisms [65] or to Vol. 5, No. 3 2008 Drug Discovery Today: Disease Models | Cardiovascular disease models www.drugdiscoverytoday.com develop novel antiarrhythmic approaches for TdP [63] . It remains unclear as to how a-AR stimulation facilitates TdP induction, but could involve increases in [Ca 2+ ] i , elevation of blood pressure or reflex vagal nerve activation [64] . Myocardial failure in the rabbit (induced by coronary artery ligation) has also been used as a model to predict the development of TdP [66] . AF can be studied in isolated rabbit atria preparations, and this has provided key insights into the mechanism of AF [67, 68] and the role of atrial dilatation [69] . Rabbit models of heart disease have been used to study atrial conduction and atrial fibrillation. Chronic volume overload from AV shunt formation slowed atrial conduction and enhanced the induction of atrial tachycardia (but not AF) [70] . However, rabbits with ventricular tachypacing-induced HF exhibit atrial fibrosis and enhanced atrial fibrillation induced by burst pacing [71] .",

These findings might arise from species differences in compensatory changes and/or species differences in cellular physiology (rabbit calcium handling and ion channel physiology is closer to that of human than what is observed in mouse). The expense and time for the development of transgenic rabbits has been limiting, but with further advances in the field, transgenic rabbits will offer important insights into cardiac physiology. Moreover, the addition of induced cardiac disease states (such as pressure overload, MI and HF) will provide novel insights into contractile dysfunction, cardiac remodeling and arrhythmogenesis.",

Although the focus of these studies is predominantly in response to antimicrobial therapy, these models have provided insight into pathogenesis of both native valve and prosthetic valve endocarditis in humans.

Direct intramuscular injection of viral vectors into rabbit LV myocardium is the simplest approach, but is limited by local transgene expression as well as traumatic effects from needle injections. Myocardial gene delivery approaches to rabbits initially involved thoracotomy-based approaches: delivery of adenoviral transgenes either by ex vivo (retrograde) intracoronary delivery to donor hearts of a heterotopic heart transplant model [94] or LV cavity injection (with ascending aorta cross-clamped) [95] . However, noninvasive techniques such as percutaneous subselective coronary artery catheterization have resulted in the efficient delivery of transgene that is ventricle-specific and targeted to the particular coronary artery that is catheterized [96] . Koch and his colleagues used these approaches to demonstrate that adenoviral gene transfer to overexpress the b 2 -adrenergic receptor or bARKct (a peptide inhibitor of b-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (bARK1)) in the rabbit MI model can enhance contractile function and b-adrenergic receptor responsiveness, and delay the onset of HF [95] [96] [97] . Other studies in rabbit include have explored adenoviral gene transfer of sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) [98] ; fibroblast growth factor-2 [28] , caspase inhibitor p35 [99] , norepinephrine transporter uptake-1 [100] , extracellular superoxide dismutase [101] and of the antiapototic factor Bcl-2 [24] .",

            "text": "There are no ideal models of heart disease, and every model utilized has both advantages and disadvantages. The rabbit has been used to develop models of a wide variety of human diseases including pressure overload, volume overload, combined pressure and volume overload, pacing-induced HF, toxic cardiomyopathy, toxic cardiomyopathy, MI and transgenic rabbit models. Transgenic rabbit models of heart disease have been developed for several human diseases and more are on the way. Rabbit models of human heart disease can offer distinct advantages over rodent or large animal (dogs and pigs) in terms of intermediate size, intermediate costs and similarities to human physiology, and can provide novel insights into human cardiac disease.",
