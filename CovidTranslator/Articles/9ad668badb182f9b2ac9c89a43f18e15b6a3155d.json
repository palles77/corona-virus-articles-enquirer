            "text": "SARS-CoV membrane protein could be detected easily using Western blotting in non-denaturing condition but not regular denaturing treatment. Boiling treatment, causing the aggregation of SARS-CoV membrane protein in the stacking gels, results in the failure to detect the membrane protein in the separating gels. Aggregated membrane proteins could not be dissociated by 1% Triton-X 100, 6 M urea, or 2% SDS. The region with amino acid residues from 51 to 170 is responsible for thermal aggregation of SARS-CoV membrane protein. Hydrophobic regions with amino acid residues from 61 to 90, from 91 to 100, from 136 to 170, are essential for this protein aggregation. Thermal aggregation of SARS-CoV membrane protein is not unique among structural proteins of coronaviruses. However, SARS-CoV membrane protein seems to be more sensitive to heat treatment, since the membrane protein of MHV-JHM, another member of the Coronaviridae, would not aggregate after the same treatment. Therefore, if SARS-CoV membrane protein needs to be analyzed using SDS-PAGE, boiling should be avoided. Thermal aggregation of SARS-CoV membrane protein may be one of the reasons for the inactivation of this virus by heat. The unusual property of SARS-CoV membrane protein aggregation induced by heat also provides a model for the study of protein aggregation.",

Coronaviruses are exceptionally large RNA viruses and employ complex regulatory mechanisms to express their genomes (Holmes and Lai, 1996) . The complete genome sequences of several SARS-CoV isolates have been determined (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . The genome structure, gene expression pattern and protein profiles of SARS-CoV are similar to those of other coronaviruses (Holmes and Enjuanes, 2003; Thiel et al., 2003) . Nine SARS-CoV specific RNAs were synthesized in virus-infected cells (Thiel et al., 2003) . These RNAs were predicted to encode two large replicative polyprotein (pp1a and pp1ab), four structural proteins (spike, membrane, envelope, and nucleocapsid proteins), and other auxiliary proteins. The four structural proteins of coronaviruses (S, E, M, and N) play roles in virion morphogenesis (Holmes and Lai, 1996) . N binds to viral RNA to form nucleocapsid. Co-expression of M and E proteins together can form virus-like particles (de Haan et al., 1998a) . Interactions between the M and E proteins and nucleocapsids result in virus budding through cellular membrane. By interaction with M protein, the S protein is incorporated into the viral envelope and the mature virions are released from the cells. It has also been demonstrated that virus-like particles of SARS-CoV could be formed by expressing M and E proteins in insect cells (Ho et al., 2004) .",

To understand the humoral immune response against SARS-CoV infection, the antibody profile against various SARS-CoV structural proteins in different time course during SARS-CoV infection needs to be examined. It has been demonstrated that different treatments (e.g. heating, 2-ME) would promote the unfolding of structural proteins in other coronaviruses (Callebaut and Pensaert, 1980; Deregt et al., 1987; Hogue and Brian, 1986; Sturman et al., 1980; Wege et al., 1979) . Therefore, both denaturing (Ma et al., 2002; Makowski and Ramsby, 1997) and non-denaturing treatments (Lin et al., 1998) should be used for antigen preparations. Nucleocapsid and spike proteins can be detected using Western blotting analysis by either denaturing condition (sample buffer containing 67.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol, treatment at 100 \u2022 C for 10 min) or non-denaturing conditions (sample buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mM dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol; no boiling treatment) while membrane protein could only be detected in non-denaturing but not denaturing condition . In the present study, factors affecting the detection of SARS-CoV membrane protein in SDS-PAGE were investigated.",

            "text": "To study whether boiling causes directly the failure to detect the membrane protein in WB analysis but not through activating other protease(s), the membrane protein transiently expressed in mammalian cells was treated with urea (1, 3, or 6M) or SDS (0.5, 1, or 2%) to inactivate possible proteases before boiling. Similar to the un-treated sample, the membrane proteins in pre-treated samples were detected at a lower level as monomers in WB analysis after boiling (data not shown, Fig. 2A ) though 2% SDS pre-treatment did reduce the effect. This result suggests that boiling treatment directly causes the failure to detect the membrane protein in WB analysis. Boiling will not breakdown the primary structure of proteins in the regular denaturing buffer (Schultz and Liebman, 1997) . Furthermore, no suspected degraded products from the membrane protein (i.e. proteins smaller than the membrane protein) were detected after boiling (data not shown and Fig. 2B ). Therefore, protein aggregation is probably the cause that leads the failure to detect the membrane protein in WB analysis. To test this possibility, the recombinant membrane protein fused with V5-His tag were expressed transiently in mammalian cells and analyzed by WB using monoclonal antibody against V5 tag in both stacking and separating gels. In Fig. 2B , the recombinant fusion membrane protein could be detected in stacking gels but not separating gels after boiling treatment. The same results were obtained when different recombinant fusion proteins (M-C-V5-His or C-M-V5-His) were used for the assays (data not shown). The existence of recombinant fusion protein after boiling could also be demonstrated by immunofluorescence of M-C-V5-His or C-M-V5-His (data not shown) using antibody against core protein. Therefore, the failure to detect the membrane protein in WB analysis is due to the thermal aggregation of this protein. The protein band marked by the thin arrow ( Fig. 2A) is unglycosylated M * protein while the other one marked by the thick arrow is glycosylated M * protein since the latter protein will reduce its size to that of the former one after deglycosylation treatment .",

In a previous study (Rota et al., 2003) , SARS-CoV membrane protein, unlike nucleocapsid or spike proteins, is hardly detected when virus particles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. It is possible that SARS-CoV membrane protein is still abundant in the virions and could not enter the separating gel due to aggregation induced by boiling. It has also been demonstrated that heat can inactivate the SARS-CoV (Rabenau et al., 2004) .

Moreover, the thermally aggregated membrane proteins were not dissociated by 1% Triton-X 100, 6 M urea, or 2% SDS (Fig. 4B) . These results indicate that extensive interaction between membrane proteins were involved during the aggregation. This possibility is strengthened when various recombinant membrane proteins with deletion in different regions were co-expressed in mammalian cells and analyzed by WB to study the interaction of different protein molecules (Fig. 4A) . Similarly, membrane proteins with smaller size (marked by dotted line in Fig. 3A and B) possibly derived from fulllength protein also could not be aggregated in the presence of full-length protein. These results suggest that thermal aggregation of membrane protein requires extensive interaction between hydrophobic regions of membrane protein. This interaction may cause the conformational change of the aggregated membrane proteins. This possibility was supported by the observation that recombinant M-V5-His fusion protein could be detected before but not after boiling treat-ment by immunoflurescence using anti-His antibody (though M-C-V5-His or C-M-V5-His could be detected by anti-core) (data not shown).

At present, it is not known whether a similar mechanism is involved in the aggregation process of these proteins. To study the assembly mechanism or the atomic structures of the aggregated membrane protein, purified recombinant SARS-CoV membrane proteins are needed. On the other hand, unlike the aggregation of light neurofilament , the SARS-CoV membrane proteins could not dissociate from aggregates to monomers by 1% Triton-100 (Fig. 4B) .
