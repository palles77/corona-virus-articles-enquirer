Adherent cells recovered from the feline lung and peritoneal cavity phagocytosed fixed red blood cells, and formed Fc-mediated rosettes. Enhancement of virus infection by MAb was investigated by inoculating alveolar macrophages with a mixtures of viral suspension and MAb, and examining the cells for intracellular viral antigen by the immunofluorescence assay and the amount of infectious virus in the supernatant fluid after incubation. The replication of FIPV in macrophages was enhanced by non-neutralizing MAbs recognizing peplomer protein (S) and transmembrane protein (M) of the virus. Even among the MAbs having the ability to neutralize FIPV strain 79-1146, some reversely enhanced virus infection when they were diluted. The enhancement was suppressed by pretreatment of the MAb with protein A. The enhancement was reduced by the use of F(ab')2 fragment of MAb. These results demonstrated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection in macrophage. The replication of FIPV 79-1146 strain in macrophages from FIPV antibody-positive cats was more enhanced than in those from antibody-negative cats.",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus, produces a chronic, progressive, immunologically-mediated disease in domestic and exotic cats. At the present time, no practical method of immunization has been reported. Cats immunized with virulence-attenuated live or inactivated FIPV are not protected against virulent FIPV challenge-exposure [t5, 20] . Cats immunized with closely related coronaviruses, such as feline 208 T. Hohdatsu etal. enteric coronavirus (FECV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), are also sensitive to exposure to virulent F I P V [2, 16, 18, 22, 29] . Infection of F I P V and the onset of the disease are accelerated in cats with F I P V antibodies in comparison with those without F I P V antibody [ 17, 18, 27] . When cats passively immunized with F I P V antibodies were infected with virulent FIPV, severe symptoms were observed and some of them died soon after the infection [ 17, 27] . These p h e n o m e n a are considered to have been caused by a mechanism similar to that of the dengue shock syndrome. Antibodydependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection, which occurs with sub-neutralizing antiviral antibodies and results from the formation of virus-antibody complexes, attachment of complexes to cell Fc receptors, and internalization by mononuclear phagocytes, has been demonstrated with some viral infections such as dengue virus infection [1, 4-6, 12-14, 25] . The feline macrophage is k n o w n to be one of the target cells for FIPV [7, 19, 28] . The in vitro growth of F I P V in feline macrophages has been reported by Stoddart and Scott [23, 24] , but the details of A D E of F I P V infection are unknown. This paper describes in vitro A D E of F I P V infection in feline macrophages.",

The percent enhancement was determined by IFA. Regardless of the concentration of antibody, ADE was more suppressed by F(ab')z fragment than by IgG (Fig. 5) . Macrophages were recovered from the alveolus and peritoneal cavity of 2 cats experimentally infected with the FECV 79-t 683 strain and of 2 coronavirus antibody negative cats. Alveolar and peritoneal macrophages, incubated for 3 days, were inoculated with the FIPV 79-1146 strain. Thirty-six hours later the virus replication in these cells was compared. Table 2 shows the results. Virus replication was distinctly better in the peritoneal and alveolar macrophages recovered from the antibody-positive cats than those from the antibody-negative cats. When no virus was inoculated onto the macrophages recovered from the antibody-positive cats, of course no viral antigen was detected by IFA, and no infectious virus was found even in the culture supernatant. When the peritoneal and alveolar macrophages were compared, viral replication tended to be better ",

            "text": "The in vitro growth of FIPV was first demonstrated in cultures of cells from the peritoneal exudate of an experimentally infected kitten in 1976 [19] . Macrophages in inflammatory lesions of the infected cat were shown to contain virus by the electron microscopic observation, suggesting the macrophage to 214 T. Hohdatsu et at. [19] . Stoddart and Scott have recently reported the growth of FIPV in macrophages recovered from the peritoneal cavity [23, 24] . In the present study adherent cells recovered from the alveolus and peritoneal cavity phagocytosed fixed red blood cells and were able to form Fc-mediated rosettes. These phenomena indicate the adherent cells to have properties of macrophages. When the adherent cells were inoculated with the FIPV 79-1146 strain, about 1-2% of the cells were revealed to be virus antigenpositive by the indirect fluorescence assay, and the supernatant fluid contained 2 x 105 PFU/ml of virus. However, no cytopathic effect was observed, suggesting the infection to be persistent and lead to a virus-carrier state. Antibody-bound virus invades cells via Fc receptors and infection is enhanced. This phenomenon has been observed in macrophages and macrophagelike cell lines with various viruses [1,4-6, 12-14, 25] . The present study disclosed that viral infection of alveolar macrophages is enhanced by intervention with MAbs without virus neutralizing activity ( Table 1 ). The enhancement was suppressed by blockade of the Fc region of antibody (Figs. 4 and 5). Even of the MAbs having the ability to neutralize FIPV strain 79-1146, some reversely enhanced the infection after they were diluted (Fig. 3b and c) . Each of the neutralizing MAbs used in this study recognizes the different epitopes of protein S of the virus. MAb 5-6-2 showed no enhancement of infection regardless of dilution (Fig. 3a) . The inhibition of virus proliferation by the MAb may be exerted after adsorption of viruses to cells. Detailed mechanisms of neutralization and enhancement of FIPV infection by these neutralizing MAbs should be further studied. A difference in viral type is considered to be closely related to the ADE of infection and to cause dengue shock syndrome in dengue virus infection [6, 14-1. We discovered the existence of at least 2 sero types of FIPV by using MAbs with ability to neutralize FIPV strain 79-1146 [8] . Effects of this type difference on ADE of FIPV infection should be studied in future.",

It also remains unsolved whether this interesting phenomenon is due to A D E by cytophilic antibody [21] or not. Some studies have shown that viral growth is better in activated macrophages [3, 10] . We also obtained better replication of FIPV in peritoneal macrophages induced by stimulation with liquid paraffin than in alveolar macrophages ( Table 2) . A D E of FIPV infection should also be studied by taking into consideration a difference in the activation of macrophages.
