            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an acute respiratory disease caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The first case was confirmed in Saudi Arabia in 2012; since then, cases have primarily occurred in countries near the Arabian Peninsula. The typical symptoms of MERS are fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and it is often accompanied by pneumonia. It is also sometimes accompanied by digestive symptoms such as diarrhea. The clinical manifestations of MERS-CoV infection range from asymptomatic infection to pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and even multi-organ failure resulting in death. In the majority of patients, the disease progresses rapidly to pneumonia within 1 week of symptom onset, for which mechanical ventilation or intensive care treatment is often required. The MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus transmitted from animals to humans, and the major reservoir host is thought to be dromedary camels; human-to-human transmission is known not to commonly http://dx.doi.org/10.3947/ic.2015. 47.3.212 \u2022 Infect Chemother 2015; 47(3) :212-222 www.icjournal.org 213 occur [1] . When human-to-human transmission does occur, it is usually the result of close contact with MERS patients, either within the family or within health-care facilities. As of August 2015, there were a total of 1,401 confirmed patients with MERS-CoV infections worldwide; of them, 500 died (mortality rate, 36%) [2] . The vast majority of cases (>85%) occurred in Saudi Arabia. In Republic of Korea, since the first confirmed MERS patient returned from Saudi Arabia in May 2015, there were a total of 186 confirmed cases, most of whom were infected during hospital outbreaks, and to date (15 August 2015) , 36 patients died (mortality rate, 19%) [3] .",

However, there was no clear conclusion about the efficacy of antivirals [4] . There is a serious lack of clinical data to demonstrate the effects of antiviral treatment in patients with MERS. The data that exists were derived from retrospective cohort studies including a small number of patients, and they do not show a clear therapeutic effect [5, 6] . In one retrospective study analyzing the effects of antiviral treatment in 44 patients with MERS, the 14-day survival rate of the treatment group was significantly higher than that of the control group (70% vs. 29%, P = 0.004), but there was no signifi-cant difference in 28-day survival (30% vs. 17%, P = 0.054) [5] . However, because patients with MERS show a high mortality rate (approximately 36% in reports from the Middle East, and 19% in the South Korean epidemic), antiviral treatment can be actively considered since their efficacy has been confirmed in laboratory studies and they have shown some degree of efficacy in retrospective clinical studies.",

            "text": "There are currently no antiviral drugs with a clearly proven clinical effect in the treatment of MERS-CoV infection. Antiviral studies reported to date have mostly been laboratory studies, and so the actual clinical data for the use of antivirals are limited. There are data from animal experiments and a small amount of clinical data for type 1 interferon, ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. Type 1 interferons include interferon-\u03b12a, -\u03b12b, and -\u03b21a. In an animal experiment in rhesus macaques, a combination regimen of interferon-\u03b12b and ribavirin showed clinical improvements and reduced severity [15] . There have been clinical case reports of patients who improved after combination therapy with interferon-\u03b12b and ribavirin [16] . However, room remains for debate due to the lack of sufficient clinical studies on combination therapy using type 1 interferon and ribavirin. In one retrospective comparative analysis of cases treated with ribavirin + interferon-\u03b12a or interferon-\u03b21a, neither regimen was effective [6] . In another retrospective clinical study of the effects of a combination regimen of interferon-\u03b12a and ribavirin, 14 of 20 patients (70%) who received this treatment survived beyond 14 days, whereas only seven of 24 patients (29%) in the non-treatment group survived, seemingly demonstrating an effect of the combination regimen (P = 0.004). However, the interpreta- [5] . Both studies have limited ability to provide statistical proof due to the small number of patients. However, since there was an overall trend for improvement in the type 1 interferon + ribavirin combination therapy group, until the lack of an effect has been shown conclusively, combination therapy is recommended. Evidence for the use of lopinavir/ritonavir as an antiviral for MERS-CoV infection is based on its efficacy in the treatment of SARS-CoV [17, 18] . In an animal experiment of common marmosets, the administration of lopinavir/ritonavir alone significantly reduced the numbers of MERS-CoV colonies in the lungs compared to the non-treatment group, and this effect was identical to that of interferon-\u03b21b [19] . Indeed, one report showed that patients administered lopinavir/ritonavir at the same time as type 1 interferon + ribavirin combination therapy showed improved viremia after 2 days [20] . Hence, if possible, the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in addition to type 1 interferon + ribavirin combination therapy is recommended. As for type 1 interferons, in vitro studies showed a stronger effect of interferon-\u03b2 than interferon-\u03b1. Moreover, of these options, the median effective inhibitory concentration (EC 50 ) to maximum serum concentration ratio of interferon-\u03b21b was lower than those of interferon-\u03b12a, interferon-\u03b12b, and interferon-\u03b21a [21, 22] . However, because clinical studies are lacking, no particular type 1 interferon can yet be concluded to be superior to the others [6] . In one in vitro study, ribavirin and interferon-\u03b12b separately inhibited MERS-CoV proliferation [23] . However, MERS-CoV proliferation was not inhibited at the typical concentrations of ribavirin used clinically, and inhibition was only confirmed at concentrations that show toxicity in humans [21] . Therefore, monotherapy with ribavirin at typical doses is expected to show a reduced clinical effect. Nevertheless, when interferon-\u03b12b and ribavirin are administered in combination, they showed a synergistic effect and a reduced dose of ribavirin was required [23] . Therefore, its combined administration with interferon is recommended.",

This reduced dose is based on the synergistic effect of combined type 1 interferon + ribavirin in an in vitro study, and it follows the dose used in the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus to ensure safety [24] . Nevertheless, since the suppression of virus proliferation showed a dose-dependent pattern in an in vitro study, the dose choice needs to be carefully considered [22, 25] .

Given the lack of clinical studies on antiviral treatment in pregnant women, it is difficult to recommend these drugs. Considering the physiological adaptations to pregnancy in pregnant women, conservative treatment should be provided [28] . When treating pregnant women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the preferred protease inhibitor is lopinavir/ritonavir [29] . Among type 1 interferons, there is evidence supporting the safe use of interferon-\u03b21a, which is used to treat multiple sclerosis, in pregnant women. Although one report showed that the incidence of spontaneous abortion increased in pregnant women who used interferon-\u03b21a, there was no statistically significant difference with the incidence in control individuals [30, 31] . Therefore, the use of antiviral drugs can be considered after a comparison of risks and benefits of the drugs. Possible antiviral treatment would be combination therapy with interferon-\u03b21a and lopinavir/tironavir, but there is no case report of this being used in pregnant women with MERS.

This could occur 3-5 days after the start of treatment, and on average occurred 10 days after the start of treatment. It mostly occurred when the dose exceeded a normal dose of 1,000-2,000 mg, so it could occur at the doses used to treat MERS-CoV. Hence, during ribavirin use, changes in hemoglobin, bilirubin, haptoglobin, and reticulocyte levels require close monitoring. If hemolytic anemia does occur, a dose reduction or cessation should be considered; if necessary, the use of lopinavir/ritonavir instead of ribavirin could be considered. Dose reduction is required in the case of impaired renal function, and ribavirin use is not recommended for patients on dialysis or those with severe renal dysfunction due to concerns of fatal hemolytic anemia. Other common adverse effects of ribavirin include bradycardia (<55/min), hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia [33] . In addition, since ribavirin shows teratogenicity, male and female patients should both use contraception for 6 months after treatment [34] .",

Chloroquine inhibited MERS-CoV replication at an EC 50 of 3.0 \u03bcM, and it is predicted to inhibit infection in the early stages. Chlorpromazine suppresses viral invasion in the early stages by inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and it is predicted to have an antiviral effect by inhibiting other later processes. Loperamide has also been suggested as a possible treatment since it inhibits two other coronaviruses at low micromolar concentrations (4-6 \u03bcM) [38, 39] . The effects of amiodarone on MERS-CoV infection have not been confirmed, but it is known to inhibit SARS-CoV proliferation at the post-endosomal level by altering the endocytic pathway, so it is predicted to have a similar effect against MERS-CoV infection [40] . One key functional receptor during host cell infection by MERS-CoV is the transmembrane protein dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Adenosine deaminase is a protein that binds to DPP4, thereby competing with MERS-CoV for DPP4 binding, and it has been confirmed to act as an antagonist to MERS-CoV infection in vitro [41] . DPP4 breaks down incretin through its enzymatic function, and the DPP4 inhibitor gliptin, which is used as a hypoglycemic agent, interferes with this enzymatic action. Therefore, DPP4 inhibitors (such as gliptin) may not interfere with MERS-CoV binding to DPP4, nor experimental studies have been conducted to date.",

This is the dose typically used in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome. d This is a reduced dose due to concerns of adverse effects caused by ribavirin, such as cytopenia or hemolytic anemia. Based on the evidence that ribavirin + interferon-\u03b1 combination therapy shows a synergistic effect in vitro, this follows the dose typically used for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus treatment to ensure safety.In dialysis patients or those with severe renal dysfunction, use of ribavirin is usually not recommended due to concerns of fatal hemolytic anemia. Therefore, if ribavirin is to be used, the patient should be closely monitored for hemolytic anemia and other major adverse effects.",
