Identifying patients with SARI and sepsis having higher risk of mortality is crucial to anticipate prognosis and follow treatment program. Many severity-scoring systems have been developed to assess the severity of these patients. Current guidelines suggest the use of various severity scores such as CURB-65 and pneumonia severity index (PSI) in order to classify patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [3] . In 2016, the third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock proposed a new definition and a scoring system based on sequential (sepsisrelated) organ failure assessment (SOFA) score instead of systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) criterion [4] , which has been used to define sepsis for a long time [5] . In addition, the Sepsis-3 task force proposed the quick SOFA (qSOFA) as a simpler scoring system for the initial screening of patients at high risk for sepsis [5, 6] . However, debates about the performances of existing classifications are still ongoing.",

Additionally, the patients who died after the 28th day during their treatment in the hospital or ICU were included in the nonsurvivor group. The secondary outcomes were the admission to the ICU and length of hospital stay. Information regarding survival or death of the patients was obtained from the patients or their relatives by phone calls within 28 days.

The possible reasons include actual epidemiological differences, climate differences, methodological differences (such as study inclusion criteria, study period, patient age, diagnostic methods used, and tested virus panels), and failure in sample collection and recording.

On the other hand, McCartney et al. reported that CURB-65 might be misleading in young adults with some atypical pneumonia [22] . A metaanalysis of 23 prospective studies including patients with radiographically-confirmed CAP revealed that the PSI had the lowest false negative rate, meaning that the test was able to correctly identify patients who had nonsevere pneumonia and were at low risk of death. On the other hand, the CURB-65 was more specific in correctly classifying patients who had a greater likelihood of death [23] . In the present study, the PSI was more sensitive but less specific than CURB-65. Capelastegui et al. [20] reported the AUROC as 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.89) for CURB-65 and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.89) for PSI in estimating the 30-day mortality. In a metaanalysis of 40 studies, Chalmers et al.
