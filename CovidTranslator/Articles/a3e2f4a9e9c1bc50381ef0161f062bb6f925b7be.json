            "text": "Little is known about platelet dynamics and the effect of antiplatelet therapy in Kawasaki disease (KD). This study sought to define platelet activation dynamics in KD patients by assaying platelet-derived microparticles (PDMPs). We measured plasma PDMPs levels in 46 patients with KD using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Blood samples were collected before, at 2-5 days, and 9-15 days after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, 2 months and 4-5 months after the onset of KD. We measured PDMP levels in 23 febrile and 10 afebrile control patients. In the acute phase of KD patients, PDMP levels increased significantly after IVIG treatment (12.04 \u00b1 5.58 nmol before IVIG infusion vs. 19.81 \u00b1 13.21 nmol at 2-5 days after IVIG infusion, P = 0.006). PDMP levels were negatively correlated with age and positively correlated with procalcitonin levels in the acute phase of KD. No significant difference was found in PDMP levels between KD patients with and without coronary artery lesion (CAL). Elevated PDMP levels after IVIG therapy significantly decreased below the pre-IVIG level in subacute phase (19.81 \u00b1 13.21 nmol at 2-5 days after IVIG infusion vs. 8.33 \u00b1 2.02 nmol at 9-15 days after IVIG infusion, P < 0.001), and PDMP levels stayed below the pre-IVIG level in the convalescent phase, during which antiplatelet therapy was given. However, PDMP levels rebounded after discontinuing aspirin in 17 patients. In conclusion, enhanced platelet activation was noted before treatment of KD and peaked immediately after IVIG treatment. Recurrent rising of PDMP levels was observed after discontinuing aspirin, although there were no significant differences between the PDMP levels at 2 months after the onset of KD and those at 4-5 months after the onset of the disease.",

The standard treatment of acute KD is a combination of high-dose (2 g/kg) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and oral aspirin (50 mg/kg/day). The acute phase of KD involves platelet activation, and antiplatelet therapy is included in the treatment protocol for this phase (1) . The finding of low levels of antithrombin III and depletion of the fibrinolytic system supports the concept that active intravascular clot formation and degradation occur in these patients and are most notable early in the acute phase of the disease (2) . Thrombosis mainly occurs in the artery and is associated with platelet activation in KD (3) . Following the cessation of fever for 2 to 3 days and improvement of all acute symptoms, the dosage of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) can be reduced to the minimum level necessary to inhibit platelet aggregation.",

Taki et al. (16) reported that enhanced platelet aggregation was noted at a high frequency before treatment of KD by using the particle counting method. They suggested that platelet activation continues during the second stage (i.e., from the start of IVIG therapy to 20 days), but platelet activation is inhibited by antiplatelet agents. A recent study demonstrated that IVIG treatment significantly decreased PDMP levels in 18 patients with acute KD (17) . They showed that the PDMP levels both immediately and 10-14 days after IVIG treatment were significantly lower than the pre-IVIG level. In contrast, we could find significant increase in PDMP level 2-5 days after IVIG treatment compared with the pre-IVIG level. We speculate that this difference was probably due to differences across ELISA kits used in this study and the timing of changes in ASA dosage. In the above-mentioned reports, they immediately changed the dose of ASA from an anti-inflammatory dose (30-50 mg/kg/day) to an anti-thrombotic dose (5 mg/ kg/day) when the patients became afebrile. However, we maintained a high dose of ASA (50 mg/kg/day) until the patient had been afebrile for 2 to 3 days and all acute symptoms were improving. The ELISA test depends on the quality of reagents, usually antibodies. In addition, the possible interference of soluble antigens may result in underestimation of microparticle levels by antigenic capture.",

            "text": "In conclusion, enhanced platelet activation is noted before treatment of KD until the convalescent phase of KD as long as 4 or 5 months after the onset of KD. These results indicate that the timing of ASA discontinuation should be evaluated in each individual patient with KD. Monitoring the biomarker of platelet activation is important because they can be used as sentinels for patients with a high risk for thrombosis such as those with intracardiac stents, complex congenital heart disease, and KD. Further studies with a larger sample size and longer follow-up period are required to clarify the clinical significance of the PD-MPs in the pathogenesis and treatment of KD.",
