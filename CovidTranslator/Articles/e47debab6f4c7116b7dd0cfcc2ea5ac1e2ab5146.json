            "text": "The efficacy of the anti-inflammatory drug Bobel-24 against experimental infection by Cryptosporidium parvum was evaluated in neonatal lambs. The animals were treated by oral administration of the drug at 50 or 500 mg/kg of body weight. The prophylactic/ therapeutic treatment was started 4 h before inoculation of the lambs with oocysts and was continued for eight consecutive days. The therapeutic treatment was initiated at the onset of diarrhoea, after confirmation of infection, and was continued for six consecutive days. Infection was monitored by daily examination of faecal samples from the first day until 30 days post-inoculation. The criteria considered in evaluating development of the infection and the drug activity were: oocyst shedding, presence of diarrhoea and weight gain at 15 and 30 days post-inoculation. Bobel-24 was effective as a prophylactic/therapeutic treatment at the lowest dose (50 mg/kg of body weight); in the group treated with this dose of drug there was a longer prepatent period, a shorter patent period and a lower intensity of oocyst excretion than in the untreated control group, and the differences were all statistically significant (P < 0.05). Moreover, one animal did not excrete oocysts, and two lambs had diarrhoea, for only 1 and 2 days. In the group treated with the higher dose of the drug, the diarrhoea lasted for a significantly shorter period (P < 0.05) than in the untreated group. #",

In neonatal lambs, the prepatent period lasts for approximately 5 days, and clinical symptoms are apparent for between 5 days and 2 weeks. The prominent symptom is mild-to-severe diarrhoea, but other clinical signs include depression, anorexia and abdominal pain. Large numbers of oocysts (10 8 -10 10 oocysts/g) are present in the diarrhoeatic stool. The weight losses and mortality (up to 40%) associated with the disease may induce important economic losses for farmers Yvor\u00e9 et al., 1984) .",

            "text": "Sporozoites of C. parvum attach to the intestinal epithelium following excystation. Specific molecules on the surface of both epithelial cells and C. parvum sporozoites are involved in the infection process. The www.elsevier.com/locate/vetpar Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Veterinary Parasitology 155 (2008) [308] [309] [310] [311] [312] [313] presence of a C. parvum sporozoite surface lectin specific to galactose-N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal-Gal-NAc) , and which may mediate attachment of sporozoites to host cells, has been demonstrated (Chen and LaRusso, 1999 ). The many drugs tested to date, such as halofuginone lactate, paromomycin and cyclodextrins (Mancassola et al., 1995; Chartier et al., 1996 Chartier et al., , 1999 Viu et al., 2000; Castro-Hermida et al., 2001 , 2004 have shown only partial effectiveness in the treatment and prophylaxis of cryptosporidiosis in neonatal lambs and goat kids. Moreover, cryptosporidiosis is difficult to control because of the resistance of the oocysts to environmental conditions and to disinfectants, including sodium hypochlorite, ammonia, chlorine, hydrogen peroxide, glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde (Korich et al., 1990; Castro-Hermida et al., 2006) . Infection by C. parvum has been demonstrated to increase concentrations of tissue prostaglandins in pigs, calves and humans (Argenzio et al., 1990; Laurent et al., 1998; Cole et al., 2003) . Prostaglandins, which are produced as an integral part of the inflammatory response to infection, inhibit sodium absorption, and their blockade with the non-specific cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin restores sodium absorption to normal levels (Argenzio et al., 1996) . Bobel-24 (2,4,6-triiodophenol), a drug obtained by chemical synthesis, has been shown to be potentially active as an anti-inflammatory agent, and has an action similar to or superior than that of other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Parre\u00f1o et al., 2006; Troc\u00f3niz et al., 2006) . Some interesting properties of phenolic compounds have been described in relation to their structure. It has been found that Bobel-24 is a dual inhibitor of lipooxygenase and cyclooxygenase, which may be important in the treatment of anti-inflammatory diseases Norton, 1997, 1999; Garc\u00eda-Capdevila et al., 1998; Parre\u00f1o et al., 2006) . Moreover, it has been shown that Bobel-24 is an inhibitor of L-selectine expression; this molecule is crucial for the attachment of Cryptosporidium sporozoites to epithelial cells (Chen and LaRusso, 2000; Rueda et al., 2008) . The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antiparasitic activity of Bobel-24 against C. parvum infection in neonatal lambs.",

            "text": "Attachment of sporozoites to epithelial cells and invasion of the cell membrane are crucial steps in the pathogenesis of cryptosporidiosis. Galactose-N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal/GalNAc) epitopes of glycoproteins on the epithelial apical membrane and Gal/GalNAcspecific sporozoite surface lectins are involved in this mechanism(s). Previous studies have shown that in vitro incubation of C. parvum sporozoites with Gal/GalNAc and bovine mucin reduces C. parvum attachment to biliary and intestinal epithelia by up to 70%. Preincubation of cell monolayers with either lectins specific to Gal/GalNAc, or glycosidases that specifically release Gal/GalNAc oligosaccharides from glycoproteins, decreased attachment by up to 80% (Chen and LaRusso, 2000) . This may be why Bobel-24 was able to inhibit up to 99.6% of the infection of HCT-8 cells by Cryptosporidium sporozoites (Rueda et al., 2008) . In the present study, Bobel-24 was not able to completely prevent infection by C. parvum in neonatal lambs. However, oocyst shedding, patent period and diarrhoea were notably reduced after administration of a prophylactic/therapeutic treatment (Bobel-24 at 50 mg/ kg). Similar results were obtained by Rueda et al. (2008) with an in vivo model of chronic cryptosporidiosis (SCID mouse). C. parvum infection increases the concentrations of tissue prostaglandins (by up to 50% of baseline levels) in both pigs and humans (Argenzio et al., 1990; Laurent et al., 1998) and diarrhoea has been partially attributed to the local production of prostanoid (Argenzio et al., 1993 (Argenzio et al., , 1996 . Bobel-24 (2,4,6triiodophenol) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The reduction in the inflammation associated with the parasite infection may account for the antidiarrhoeic effects observed in this study. A global reduction in the level of oocyst excretion was observed, which may be the result of an anticryptosporidial effect of the drug, as demonstrated in vitro by Rueda et al. (2008) . Nevertheless, it is possible that in the present study the decrease in the level of excretion was due to the reduced levels of diarrhoea.",

The higher therapeutic activity shown by the lower doses of Bobel-24 in terms of oocyst excretion, patent period, presence of diarrhoea and weight gain during the first 15 days of the animals' lives may be due to the low solubility of the product; the more amount of the product the more difficult preparation of homogeneous and adequate dosages. Problems in both solubility and bioavailability of this compound have been previously suggested by Rueda et al. (2008) .",
