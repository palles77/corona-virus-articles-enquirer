Since the spread of an infectious disease is related to the intensity of contacts between individuals, fragmentation destabilizes the way the parasites circulate in their host population. Recently, Zinkernagel has proposed that a reduction in the frequency of infections by a parasite could lead to the emergence of severe forms of the disease, previously avoided because the disease was contracted early in life and attenuated by maternal antibodies. However, it is still unclear whether this change in disease expression increases the global mortality it induces because the disease becomes more severe and also less frequent. Here, we use a mathematical model to link population fragmentation with the hypothesis of Zinkernagel. Firstly, we show that there is a change in the severity of the disease during the fragmentation process, especially at a local scale, suggesting that host population fragmentation could be a widespread mechanism of disease emergence. Secondly, we show that the emergence of the severe form of the disease can lead to a significant increase in its induced mortality. Finally, we determine the types of interactions for which the fragmentation of the host population could be the most dangerous.",

Moreover, most attention is paid to the emergence of the pathogen agent and emergence of the disease by a simple change in the expression of the agent is often overlooked.

At low transmission rates, a large proportion of the hosts become infected after maternal antibodies have waned and thus can develop a severe form of the disease. In contrast, at high transmission rates most hosts are infected when carrying maternal antibodies (Fouchet et al. 2006 ). The disease is then less severe and, according to Zinkernagel, induces an immune response, which protects the host from potential re-infections. A reduction in the transmission rate thus changes the interaction from a situation where most diseases are attenuated by maternal antibodies to a situation with rare but severe diseases since the severe form of the disease emerges from a reduction in the transmission rate of its associated parasite. Zinkernagel (2001 Zinkernagel ( , 2003 argued that improvement of hygiene could have been a cause of severe disease emergence, such as poliomyelitis in the 1950s, because it reduces the frequency of contacts we have with parasites.",

            "text": "The fact that an intense circulation of a parasite helps to reduce its severity is a phenomenon known as endemic stability (Norval et al. 1992) . In a modelling framework, Coleman et al. (2001) have shown that endemic stability is dependent on two conditions: (i) the average severity of the infection increases with age and (ii) secondary infections are of reduced severity. Clearly, the emergence scenario of Zinkernagel can extend to all host-parasite interactions that fulfil these two conditions. The second condition is achieved in many interactions since it is fulfilled by immune memory. Maternal antibodies have been shown to achieve the first condition, e.g. in measles (Bennett et al. 1999) or in respiratory syncitial virus in mice (Crowe et al. 2001) , cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus; Prince et al. 1985 Prince et al. , 1987 Walsh et al. 1994 ) and calves (Bos taurus; Kimman et al. 1988 ). However, maternal antibodies are not the only way to fulfil the first condition of increasing infection severity with age. For example, rubella is benign, except during pregnancy when it may cause malformations to the foetus (congenital rubella syndrome, CRS) and so an early infection in girls facilitates avoidance of the dangerous effects of the disease. An interesting case in point is that of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus and probably European brown hare syndrome, respectively, infecting rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and brown hares (Lepus europaeus). Newborns are resistant to these diseases because they lack the receptors on which the virus binds to infect the cells (Ruvo\u00ebn-Clouet et al. 2000) . As a result, the severity of the infection increases progressively with age and asymptomatic infections does not prevent active immunization of the host (Robinson et al. 2002 for rabbit and Zanni et al. 1993 for brown hare). Lastly, resistance below the given age is observed, but not yet fully understood, for several diseases, such as under 18 months for malaria (Snow et al. 1998; Wagner et al. 1998 ) and under 12-year old for SARS (Hon et al. 2003; Leung et al. 2004) .",

Similar to the improvement of hygiene in humans, the fragmentation of a large population into a number of poorly connected subpopulations also alters the circulation of the pathogen and can be responsible for disease emergence in wildlife populations. Indeed, continuous populations favour the spread of the pathogen agent, conferring early infection on the young rarely leading to severe diseases. In contrast, in small isolated populations, the pathogen agent frequently disappears and the isolation of the host population prevents its rapid reintroduction. During the disease-free period, young animals lose their maternally derived protections without encountering infection. When the pathogenic agent is re-introduced, most individuals are fully susceptible and most infections are severe. Although in the past, it was accepted that population fragmentation reduced the level of infection of the population and thus reduced the impact of the pathogen (Hess 1994 (Hess , 1996 , more recent studies have shown that fragmentation also destabilizes the whole host-pathogen interaction. For example, Carlsson-Graner & Thrall (2002) have shown that increasing fragmentation leads to fewer populations being diseased, but the few diseased populations are more severely affected.

We demonstrate that even though the severe form of the disease has disappeared from the population before the fragmentation process, it can re-emerge after the circulation of the microparasite is disrupted during the fragmentation process. Population fragmentation could, therefore, be an important cause of disease emergence in wildlife populations. However, one could argue that such emergence of severe disease is not important because it does not necessarily lead to an increase in the impact of the disease. Indeed, with fragmentation, epidemics becomes not only more severe but also more rare. Moreover, protection by maternal antibodies is not perfect and the mild form of a disease can also be a source of additional mortality.

Owing to the high transmission rate of the disease, most individuals are immune and transmit maternal antibodies to their offspring. In addition, young animals get infected rapidly and then develop attenuated disease (figure 3a). As a result, only a small number of individuals die from the severe form of the disease. At an advanced stage of the fragmentation process (figure 3b), the circulation of the microparasite is drastically changed. The population is now made up of small (here KZ40) and poorly connected subpopulations, in which the parasite barely persists. Long disease-free periods alternate with epidemics in subpopulations. Most individuals born with maternal antibodies during the inter-epidemic period have lost their maternal protection before becoming infected, so they are susceptible to the severe form of the disease.

In summary, at the beginning of the fragmentation process, deaths from the disease are rare. The parasite is present in every subpopulation and so most young are in contact with the parasite. Non-exposure during early life is more a matter of bad luck than a question of spatial localization. Deaths from the severe form of the disease are rare and diffuse in the entire population without spatial aggregation. The severe form of the disease can remain undetected over very long periods, especially if the host species is not intensively monitored. In contrast, at an advanced stage of the fragmentation process, deaths from the severe disease are mainly due to local epidemics.

We focus on the standard value of the parameters. Clearly, during the course of fragmentation populations are less likely to retain the pathogen (figure 4b). After the fourth fragmentation event, the persistence time of the pathogen within subpopulations shows an important decrease, leading to a higher proportion of disease-free subpopulations Variables are estimated over 8-year period starting 2 years after the last fragmentation event (tZ10FC2) and ending at the beginning of the next one (tZ10FC10). The initial 2 years of the period are omitted to discount fluctuations arising from fragmentation of the population; (a) evolution of the impact of the pathogen in relation to the number of fragmentation events (x-axis). For each replicate, the impact of the pathogen is calculated by the total number of dead individuals (from mild or severe disease) during the 8-year period, divided by the mean size of the entire population over that same period; (b) mean time before extinction (solid line) and re-introduction (dashed line) of the pathogen after F fragmentation events (x-axis). Extinction times above 1200 months (100 years) are described as more than 1200. For such values, local extinction within 10 years becomes very unlikely (as in (c)). Extinction and re-introduction times are calculated using specific methods detailed in the electronic supplementary material; and (c) proportion of disease-free subpopulations (solid lines), of unoccupied subpopulations (i.e. where the host species has become extinct, dotted lines) and of disease-free metapopulations (dashed lines) during the 8-year period following the F th fragmentation event (x-axis). The probability of extinction of the entire metapopulation is calculated for each replicate as the number of times during the 10-year period when the entire metapopulation is extinct, divided by the number of months (nZ96) within the period.

The level of connectivity between subpopulations influences the level of fragmentation needed to observe an increased impact of the disease (figure 5a). For higher levels of connectivity between neighbours, the impact of fragmentation occurs later. Indeed, the increased impact of the pathogen is due to the loss of maternal immunity that follows the extinction of the pathogen. But if the level of connectivity between neighbours is high, few individuals will lose their maternal protection before disease re-introduction, i.e. connectivity between neighbours balances regular pathogen extinctions. However, the impact of the disease is greater for intermediate levels of connectivity. For high levels, the former argument holds (re-introductions balance extinctions). For low levels, the impact of the disease remains low as long as individual subpopulations are able to retain the parasite. When the sizes of the subpopulations become too small to keep the parasite over long periods, the frequency of re-introduction of the parasite is low and epidemics are not only more severe but also much rarer, resulting in a lower impact of the disease (compared with situations where the connectivity is higher, figure 5a) .",

In contrast, as seen above, at an advanced stage of the fragmentation process most diseases are contracted after maternal antibodies have waned. This decrease in the relative impact of the fragmentation can be balanced by assuming a higher transmission rate (figure 5c). Finally, the increase in the transmission rate of the disease is found to have an effect mainly at the beginning of the fragmentation process where it decreases the impact of the disease.

Results show that a species with greater life expectancy will be affected by fragmentation sooner, but with a smaller relative impact (figure 5d). These results can be explained by the fact that a lower birth rate reduces the supply of susceptible individuals, increasing the probability of local extinction for the parasite. A lower persistence time then implies that the population requires an intense connectivity to maintain an endemic circulation of the parasite within each subpopulation through frequent re-introductions. The level of fragmentation required for an increase in the impact of the parasite will then decrease with the persistence of the parasite. The other consequence of low persistence of the disease induced by low birth rates is that the parasite is unlikely to persist in the entire population. When global persistence of the parasite is not attained, the spatial structure of the population is not really important, as long as epidemics induced by external re-introductions can reach every part of the population. So the impact of the disease is then, in our model, mainly driven by external re-introductions that occur randomly, which explains the greater variability of the system for lower birth rates (figure 5d).",

            "text": "The spatial organization of a host population can play a major role in determining the impact of a microparasite that is potentially attenuated in early life, e.g. when mothers transfer protective antibodies to their offspring. The introduction of the pathogen in a diseasefree population always leads to an epidemic when most infections are severe. But if the population is not much fragmented, the impact of the pathogen rapidly decreases. This is because the pathogen circulates so that young animals are infected while they are still partly protected, develop an attenuated disease and activate their immune system. Only sporadic deaths from the severe disease are observed. In contrast, in highly fragmented populations, the pathogen rapidly fades out locally. Once re-introduced into the subpopulation, individuals are not protected and several cases of the disease can be observed in the same locality. The aggregation of severe disease cases occurs with a simultaneous increase in their frequency so that the severe disease (re-)emerges in the population. One important question is whether the increase in severe disease frequency of the pathogen is followed by an important increase in its impact in the long term? Our model indicates that it is and allows us to define important factors that could modulate the increased impact of disease in relation to fragmentation. The most important factor is certainly the level of mortality induced by the mild form of the disease, because the prevalence of the mild form of the disease largely decreases during the course of the fragmentation process. Another important factor is the capacity of the parasite to circulate intensively (i.e. to provide regular intense exposure to the young animals) in a situation where the pathogen is locally more persistent. For this reason, the transmission rates of severe and mild diseases and the susceptibility of young individuals are critical factors. Finally, the parasite needs to persist at a scale where the rate of parasite exchange between individuals is high. This requires a high persistence of the parasite that may be achieved in several ways. For example, the distribution of the infectious period (Keeling & Grenfell 1997; Anderson & Britton 2000; Lloyd 2001a,b) , the host spatial structure (Bolker & Grenfell 1995; Park et al. 2002) , the birth rate (Swinton et al. 1998 ) and the transmission rate of the parasite (Swinton et al. 1998; Anderson & Britton 2000) are all the well-known factors that can greatly influence the persistence of a parasite in its host population.",

Keeling (2000) has shown that the capacity of the pathogen to persist within its host population was a key factor in its evolution. In poorly connected metapopulations, endemic strains of the pathogen tend to be selected for, even when less persistent variants are assumed to be fitter. The localized emergence of bubonic plague in humans is interesting in terms of the endemic versus epidemic behaviour of the pathogen. Indeed, Keeling et al. (2000a,b) have proposed that bubonic plague emerges in humans when Yersinia pestis, the bacterium responsible for the disease, is re-introduced in rat populations after long absences, through a mechanism that is described in more detail below. Long-term persistence of the bacteria in rat populations may prevent this emergence. Similarly, our study highlights the local persistence time of the pathogen as a key epidemiological factor that can change the entire relationship between the host and its pathogenic agent.",

In our context, waning of acquired immunity could be a very important factor. Waning immunity significantly increases the circulation of a parasite. For example, in a theoretical framework, Aguas et al. (2006) obtained a very high prevalence of pertussis for relatively low transmission rates in cases of waning immunity. Therefore, waning immunity could greatly reduce the level of parasite transmission required to induce an early infection in young individuals. Significantly, waning immunity increases the duration of persistence of the parasite by providing new susceptible individuals.",

Short-lived species structured into high-density groups are able to maintain parasites locally, thereby favouring high levels of exposure and juvenile infection while young are protected by maternal antibodies. Potentially highly lethal parasites can circulate in these populations without inducing significant mortality rates. These species are most at risk because fragmentation of their populations can then reveal the potential lethality of the parasite. For the same reason, the negative impact of fragmentation would be highest when the pathogen is highly infectious and possesses mechanisms for persistence, such as longlasting infectious periods, reservoirs (e.g. vectors, infected ground) or reactivation after latency. However, one should remember that we focused here on a particular mechanism of population fragmentation. Other features, like the decrease in connectivity between neighbours, have not been modelled. Incorporating such features into our model could help to more accurately define the host-parasite interactions that are the most susceptible to the effects of fragmentation.",

            "text": "A good example that fits quite well with the criteria discussed above is the rabbit-RHDV system. Rabbits live in social groups that can locally reach very high densities (Palomares et al. 2001 ). The rabbits have rapid populations turnovers, with half of the population being replaced by newborn each year (Parer 1977; Rogers et al. 1994) . But the size of populations dramatically decreased in different areas in the 1980s following the emergence of the rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) caused by the rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV; Liu et al. 1984) . Circulation of the virus has been reported to have occurred prior to the emergence of the disease (e.g. Rodak et al. 1990b; Moss et al. 2002) . These results suggest that rabbits had been exposed to a pre-existing non-pathogenic strain (Rodak et al. 1990a (Rodak et al. , 1991 Chasey et al. 1995; Nowotny et al. 1997; Trout et al. 1997) . However, evidence of such non-pathogenic strains is still lacking especially from the field (but see Capucci et al. 1996 ). An alternative, but non-exclusive hypothesis is based on the mechanism discussed here. Firstly, rabbit populations have been increasingly fragmented in recent decades (Papillon & Godron 1997; Palomares et al. 2001; Virgos et al. 2003) . Secondly, young rabbits are protected against the disease, but can develop an immune response if they are in contact with the virus (Robinson et al. 2002) . Lastly, the impact of RHD appears to be highly variable among populations, being high in some populations whereas in others most individuals are carrying protective antibodies against the virus without reported mass mortality from the disease (Rodak et al. 1990a (Rodak et al. , 1991 Chasey et al. 1995; Capucci et al. 1997; Nowotny et al. 1997) . Increased impact of RHD in Europe in relation to rabbit population fragmentation thus represents an interesting alternative to the classical view according to which RHD has emerged through a mutation in the pathogenic agent.",

            "text": "Re-emergence of severe forms of an animal disease with subsequent mass mortality may have consequences for the transmission of pathogens to humans. A good example may be the case of diseases transmitted by fleas, such as the bubonic plague. Keeling & Gilligan (2000a,b) have shown that cases of human plague were strongly correlated to mass mortality in the disease reservoir, rats. Mass mortality of rats causes fleas to search for an alternative host, such as humans, hence transmitting the bacteria. These authors have shown that increased isolation of rat populations led to increased emergence in humans. Indeed in large rat populations, the disease never disappears, causing regular exposure of all individuals. Deaths spread out over time and the rat population is only minimally reduced. In contrast, in poorly connected rat populations, susceptible rats accumulate, resulting in a large epidemic when the pathogen is re-introduced and a significant reduction in the rat population. Consequently, there is a greater likelihood of transmission to humans. Since this mechanism is based on the different impact of the pathogen between epidemic and endemic periods in rats, attenuation of early infections could play an important role by increasing the differential mortality between endemic and epidemic periods, thereby increasing the severity of epidemics.",

Thus, a disease that appears benign could become severe.",

Other parameters are set to their basic value; (a) impact of the level of connectivity between neighbours. lZ0.1 (dotted line), lZ0.01 (standard, bold line), lZ0.001 (dashed line); (b) impact of the additional death rate induced by mild disease, keeping the duration of the disease (a M Cs M ) K1 constant. a M Z0 (dashed line), a M Z0.05 (standard, bold line), a M Z0.1 (dashed-dotted line), a M Z0.15 (dotted line), a M Z0.2 (solid thin line); (c) impact of the transmission coefficients of the disease. rZqZ0.5 and b 0 Z100 (dashed line), rZqZ0.5 and b 0 Z400 (dashed-dotted line), rZqZ1 and b 0 Z50 (dotted line), rZqZ1 and b 0 Z200 (solid thin line); (d) impact of the birth rate. bZ0.16 (dashed line), bZ0.08 (standard, bold line), bZ0.04 (dashed-dotted line); bZ0.02 (dotted line) and bZ0.01 (solid thin line); (e) impact of the external re-introduction rate. 3Z0.0083 (dashed line), 3Z0.083 (standard, bold line) and 3Z0.83 (dotted line).",
