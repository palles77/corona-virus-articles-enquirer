Indoor air pollution has been extensively studied in homes (Morawska et al., 2017; Rohra and Taneja, 2016) , schools (Cai et al., 2015; Forns et al., 2017) , hospitals (Cabo Verde et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015b) , offices (Azuma et al., 2018; Song et al., 2015) , restaurants (Dai et al., 2018; Fazlzadeh et al., 2015) , and subway metros (Kim et al., 2015; Xu and Hao, 2017) . However, indoor air pollution continues to be a global problem, especially in developing countries. Research studies have shown that about 90% of time is being spent in the aforementioned indoor environments (Andrade and Dominski, 2018) . This is about 5 times higher than that of average time spent in outdoor environments, which indicates the enormity of human health risk posed by the indoor air pollutants (Andrade and Dominski, 2018; Boor et al., 2017; Cincinelli and Martellini, 2017; Du et al., 2018) . These indoor air pollutants generally originate from the ambient environment. However, in cities with high ambient air pollutant levels, indoor air pollutants may be of greater concern (Morawska et al., 2017) .",

Further, the GCC countries are categorized as developing countries and they are well-known as the hub for the majority of global oil reserves and crude oil production plants. Hence, with the recent increase in industrial activities, infrastructural developments, and population growth, which are coupled with unfavorable outdoor weather conditions, indoor air quality (IAQ) can be counted as a great concern for human health. This affirms that there can be a high risk of exposure to indoor air pollutants compared to the countries with favorable weather conditions, where people spend much of their time in outdoor environments.",

For all of these countries, most indoor air pollution studies have been focused on measuring the concentration levels and characterization of chemical species. Previous reviews have shown that particulate matters (PMs), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and heavy metals were the major indoor air pollutants in the GCC countries (Abdul-Wahab and Al-Rehaili, 1999; Al Mulla et al., 2015; Argyropoulos et al., 2016; Elsayed et al., 2016; Farahat, 2016; Omidvarborna et al., 2018; Saraga et al., 2017) . Recent studies in KSA have identified Radon ( 222 Rn) gas as another indoor air pollutant (Abo-Elmagd et al., 2018; Alghamdi and Aleissa, 2014) . Moreover, it has been reported that indoor air pollution in most cities in the GCC region is due to the infiltration of ambient air pollutants into residential buildings, poor ventilations, burning of biomasses (Arabian incense), and overcrowding (Argyropoulos et al., 2016; Fadeyi et al., 2014; Jomehzadeh et al., 2017; Weitzman et al., 2016; Yaghi and Abdul-Wahab, 2003) . For example, incomplete burning of Arabian incense emits CO, PM 10 , PM 2.5 , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and black carbon (BC), which cause deleterious health effects for the exposed population (Du et al., 2018) . To critically assess the current state of indoor air pollution in the GCC countries, this structured review was conducted to characterize emission of indoor air pollutants, identify the sources, discuss the possible mitigation strategies, identify knowledge gaps, and recommend future research works. For this purpose, > 130 research articles were selected and reviewed.",

Elsayed et al. (2016) characterized a complete profiling of Bakhour (an Arabian incense), as a commonly burnt indoor household biomass used in UAE (commonly produced in Sharjah). It was found that Bakhour emitted trace metals such as Pb, Zn, Cd, Al, Fe, Co, and other known or suspected carcinogenic compounds of acetic acid phenylmethyl ester, benzoic acid hydrazide, ethylbenzene, 1,2-dimethoxy-4-(1-propenyl)-benzene, 9-dodecyl-tetradecahydro-anthracene, and \u03b1-methyl-benzenemethanol. About 859 chemical compounds (e.g., p-xylene, styrene, \u03b2-myrcene, acetic acid, furfural, 1,4-dibenzehaxanoic acid, azulene, diethyl phthalates) are known to be emitted from the smokes and fine ashes of Bakhour (Dalibalta et al., 2015) . Hookah cigarette is another major source of indoor air pollution problem in UAE. Weitzman et al. (2016) measured that there is a wide variability of exposure levels between non-hookah PM 2.5 concentration level (210.8 \u03bcg/m 3 (95% CI: 78.4-343.2)) and hookah smoking PM 2.5 concentration level (428.6 \u03bcg/ m 3 (95% CI: 50.2-806.9)) rooms. Additionally, large amounts of Zn, Cu, V, Ni, Pb, Mn and Cr elements were found to exist as ultrafine particles (PM 0.1 ) and fine particles (PM 2.5 ) in UAE indoors (Hamdan et al., 2018) , where the majority of dwellers spend 85% of their times indoors, especially during summer seasons. Analysis of indoor air compositions in 638 homes in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Fujaira, Sharjah, and Ajman revealed that the median concentrations of formaldehyde (HCHO) (13.2 \u03bcg/m 3 ), PM 2.5 (6.06 \u03bcg/m 3 ), and PM 10 (41.3 \u03bcg/m 3 ) were higher than the recorded urban exposure levels of HCHO (66.1 \u03bcg/m 3 ), PM 2.5 (6.0 \u03bcg/m 3 ), and PM 10 (38.5 \u03bcg/ m 3 ) in many cases (Funk et al., 2014) . The sources of the pollutants were attributed to smoking, air conditioners, and kitchen activities. A one year IAQ measurement campaign was conducted in 16 elementary schools within Dubai and Fujairah in UAE. Average indoor O 3 concentration (106 \u03bcg/m 3 ) in classrooms was found to be low compared to average CO (1.43 mg/m 3 ) and CO 2 (3110 mg/m 3 ) levels. However, the large amount of average inhalable PM concentration levels (316 to 9828 \u03bcg/m 3 ) were found to be a major concern, especially to children in the classrooms (Fadeyi et al., 2014) . This is due to greater susceptibility to indoor air pollution by children as they could breathe larger volume of air contained respirable pollutants compared to adults (Cai et al., 2015) .",

TPM and TVOC were ranged from 102-157 \u03bcg/m 3 and 1202-2340 \u03bcg/m 3 , respectively; while, HCHO concentration level (13.2 mg/m 3 ) was low (Behzadi and Fadeyi, 2012) .

Also, these airborne bioaerosols were identified in hospitals to be higher in intensive care units (687 CFU/m 3 ) compared to the operating theatre rooms (473 CFU/m 3 ) (Jaffal et al., 1997b) . The high indoor bacterial exposure concentrations were attributed to overcrowding (Memish et al., 2014) .",

The study revealed that Pb, CO and TSP concentration levels were far more than the threshold limits, whereas the emission sources were found in outdoor environments as indicated by the statistical correlations with the indoor levels (Al-Rehaili, 1999). In the same city, three most abundant trace gases were measured with average concentration levels of 1300, 1095 and 26.4 \u03bcg/m 3 for SO 2 , NH 3 , and HCHO, respectively (Al-Rehaili, 2002) . Although the average concentration values were reported low, the concentration levels in most sampling locations (e.g., hospitals and schools) exceeded the US EPA's 24-h standards of 395 \u03bcg/m 3 , for example for SO 2 (Al-Rehaili, 2002). The measurements of IAQ continued in other cities as well. In Dammam city, lower concentration levels of CO (3.95 mg/m 3 ), NO 2 (40.5 \u03bcg/m 3 ), SO 2 (169 \u03bcg/m 3 ), and VOCs (e.g., C 6 H 6 ) (0.4 ppm) were detected among the elementary schools. It was reported that high proximity of the school buildings to the traffic was the reason to detect such pollutants indoors (El-Sharkawy, 2014). In another study, a slight increase in the concentration levels of CO (5.43 mg/m 3 ), NO 2 (608 \u03bcg/ m 3 ), SO 2 (197 \u03bcg/m 3 ), and VOCs (0.4 ppm) with the exception of PM 10 (78 \u03bcg/m 3 ) and PM 2.5 (38 \u03bcg/m 3 ) was observed in restaurants, where PM concentration values exceeded the international standards as listed in Table 2 (El-Sharkawy and Javed, 2018). The main cause of high PM levels was found as poor ventilation in the restaurants. The concentration levels of indoor CO 2 in university buildings were assessed in Jeddah city, KSA. A significant association among indoor temperature, humidity and high CO 2 concentration levels was reported (Jaber et al., 2017) .",

            "text": "In recent years, there have been increasing concerns about emerging flame retardants (FRs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) due to their recalcitrant persistence and bioaccumulation behaviors in the air (He et al., 2018) . According to Ali et al. (2016a) , average exposure levels to organophosphate FRs in indoor cars, air conditioning filters, and household floors in Jeddah were recorded to be 10,500, 15,400, and 3750 ppb, respectively. From the study, penta-PBDEs, decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE), and chlorinated alkyl phosphate were identified as the most common indoor chemicals within the three indoor microenvironments. In another study, indoor HCHO in a medical science laboratory room was investigated in King Saud University. The sources of HCHO exposure levels (~0.93-1.2 mg/m 3 ) were attributed to poor ventilations. However, HCHO concentrations were higher at the center of the dissecting rooms compared to the corners, where instructors and students might experience higher exposure levels (Vohra, 2011) . In addition, several studies have identified the presence of other non-conventional organic pollutants (including siloxanes, phenolic antioxidants, and tetrabromobisphenol A) in indoor dust in KSA, which were emitted from household products (Tran et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015a; Wang et al., 2016) . Besides the trace gases (FR and PBDEs) and PMs, which are primary pollutants in indoor environments of KSA, an extensive study on a radioactive contaminant (Radon gas) has been carried out in KSA, while lacking in UAE. Radon is known to be colorless and odorless gas. Due to its carcinogenic health effects, Radon has been widely monitored in many developed countries (Al-Jarallah and Fazal Ur, 2005) . A measuring campaign of indoor Radon gas in 786 dwellings in Riyadh showed an average emission of 24.6 Bq/m 3 , which was below the WHO standard limit (100 Bq/m 3 ). Radon levels were high (1-195 Bq/m 3 ) in rooms with low ventilation rates compared to central air conditioning rooms (Alghamdi and Aleissa, 2014) . Similarly, about 651 dosimeters were deployed to measure indoor Radon levels in 60 rooms, including kitchen, bed rooms, and living rooms over a continuous period of 8 months in Riyadh. The overall average (18.4 Bq/m 3 ), minimum (2.0 Bq/m 3 ), and maximum (69 Bq/m 3 ) concentration levels were below WHO standard limit (Al-Saleh, 2007) . In King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh, Radon concentrations in buildings with basement during winter and summer seasons were 44.3 and 26.1 Bq/m 3 , and buildings without basement were 16.1 and 16.7 Bq/m 3 , respectively. Thus, seasonal variations were critical factors affecting Radon concentration levels in KSA. Exposures to Radon gas in residential buildings were carried out in different parts of Al-Madinah Al-Munawarah in the Western province of KSA over a 6 months period. The concentration levels of Radon (Bq/m 3 ), which could be exposed to the residents of the Northern, Eastern, Western and Southern parts of the city were 42 \u00b1 1.6, 21 \u00b1 2.5, 27 \u00b1 3.2, and 37 \u00b1 2.6, respectively (Mohamed et al., 2014) .",

Large overcrowding at worshiping places (Mosques), pilgrimage centers, and airports are the important causes of airborne bioaerosols. Al-Madinah Al-Munawarah is a province in KSA, where there could be high concentration levels of indoor bioaerosols might happen due to overcrowding of pilgrims. A survey study measured pilgrim's exposure to bacterial and fungi aerosols over four consecutive weeks using sedimentation procedures in Al-Haram and Al-Nabawi cities. The most common identified bacterial aerosols were Staphylococcus sp. (32.47%), Mircrococus sp. (18.8%), Baccilus sp. (12.85%), and Dermacoccus (11.23%); while, Aspergigillus sp. (78%) was the highest among identified fungi species. The main causes were poor ventilation and overcrowding. However, the degree of infection depends on the immunity of the exposed population (Alananbeh et al., 2017) . Human adenovirus (42.8%), human coronavirus (42.8%), Haemophilus influenza (14.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (14.2%) were the dominant respiratory pathogens that identified in King Abdul Aziz International Airport during Hajj season (Memish et al., 2014) . Another study on concentration and characterization of bioaerosols using Airport MD gelatin filter sampler was conducted in mosque buildings in Makkah, KSA. Bacterial and fungal concentrations were found to be 10-50 CFU/m 3 and 10 CFU/m 3 , respectively. Bacillus sp., Microccoccus sp., and Aspergillus niger were the most abundant species of airborne microbes found within the mosques (Mashat, 2015) . Later, a study focused on bioaerosols among the schools in KSA. Bacteria aerosols of 252 samples in 25 middle schools in Riyadh were isolated over one month period. It was found that the highest airborne bacteria were Pseudomona stutzeri, Francisella tularensis, Ralstonia mannitolillytica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Kocuria kristinae. The highest bioaerosol concentrations were occurred during class hours (overcrowding); therefore, immediate mitigation action was required (Al Mijalli, 2017) .",

Due to the large abundance of proven reservoirs, the economy of the country chiefly depends on oil and gas extraction, which have led to serious concerns about air pollution and associated health effects. Qatar was recently rated as the second among the top globally air polluters (especially PM) caused by both anthropogenic (e.g., oil industries) and natural (e.g., dust storms) sources (Alfoldy, 2018) . In addition, massive construction activities in the country are happened similar to UAE. These construction activities, which count as the important sources of air pollution, have increased steadily as Qatar is preparing to host the FIFA World Cup in 2022 (Sofotasiou et al., 2015) . Literature review revealed that infiltration of ambient air caused a serious health issues in Qatar (Al-Rehaili, 2002; El-Sharkawy, 2014; Radaideh and Shatnawi, 2015; Soleimani et al., 2016) . > 20 indoor air pollution articles were published about Qatar, which were lower than that of UAE and KSA. Some of the current indoor air pollution studies in Qatar are summarized in Table 3 .",

In 2017, the pollutant emissions from a 60-seater water pipe caf\u00e9 equipped with a brand new HVAC system were carried out for six days in Kuwait city. Hourly maximum concentration levels of PM 1 (27 \u03bcg/ m 3 ), PM 2.5 (92 \u03bcg/m 3 ), CO (49.5 mg/m 3 ), and CO 2 (3244 mg/m 3 ) were obtained, especially during the late hours operation of the caf\u00e9 (Al-Dabbous et al., 2018) . Due to the importance of the topic, Freeman et al. (2018) estimated the annual emissions of indoor \"Sheesha\" and \"Nargila\" water pipes in the selected restaurants and caf\u00e9s in Kuwait city via Monte Carlo simulation. The yearly emission levels (kg) were 744.3, 233.7, 225.7, and 1.34 for NOx, N 2 O, NH 3 , and PAH, respectively. Further, CO, which is one of the hazardous indoor air pollutants, was determined to be 80.33 tons. In other words, the yearly emissions of NOx, N 2 O, NH 3 , PAHs and CO could be converted into 85, 26.7, 25.8, 0.15 and 9170 g per hour, respectively. These concentration levels were extremely high and could dangerously affect human health. However, measured emission data were important to be compared with the modeled data.",

This naturally occurring radioactive pollutant has been fairly studied in Kuwait. In 2003, a measurement campaign was conducted in 271 bedrooms and 268 living rooms in Kuwait city by using Pico-Rad detectors. The mean indoor Radon exposure levels ranged from 4.0-241 Bq/m 3 , where few homes had Radon concentrations above the threshold limit of 100 Bq/m 3 (Al-Azmi et al., 2008) . In educational institutions, Radon testing was carried out in 25 school buildings with similar building designs and HVAC systems over a period of 6 months with Track-Etch detectors. The results showed a mean Radon level of 16 \u00b1 4 Bq/m 3 and alpha dose equivalent rate of 0.97 \u00b1 0.25 mSv/yr (Maged, 2006) . Another 2-year comparative indoor Radon gas assessment among a total of 150 schools and residential buildings was conducted in Kuwait by Al-Awadi and Khan (2018). The minimum and maximum Radon concentrations in school buildings were 7 \u00b1 1 and 405 \u00b1 21 Bq/m 3 , respectively. The Radon levels increased in residential homes, where the minimum and maximum concentrations were 13 \u00b1 1 and 595 \u00b1 30 Bq/m 3 , respectively. The exposure level was attributed to the basement of the buildings, where poor ventilations could be an important factor for high Radon concentration levels.",

However, they were considered hazardous to human health, especially the vulnerable populations such as children and the aged population (Madany et al., 1987) . Indoor dusts, the main source of inhalable fine PMs, were collected from households and hospitals and analyzed to determine their chemical constituents. The results showed that the average indoor Pb, Cd, and Cr were 360, 29.2, and 154.5 ppm in homes and 697, 72, and 144.4 ppm in hospitals, respectively. The study attributed the high concentration of heavy metals to outdoor traffic emissions (Akhter, 1993) . Similarly, in-home assessment of indoor heavy metals from traffic related emissions was investigated. The probable concentrations of human exposure for Pb, Zn, Cd, Cr, and Ni were reported to be 517, 202, 1.9, 11, and 10 ppm, respectively (Madany, 1994) .

An efficient ventilation system (i.e., either natural or mechanical) should reduce the concentration of indoor air pollutants and prevent the entry of ambient air pollutants (Cabo Verde et al., 2015; Jovanovi\u0107 et al., 2014; Vanker et al., 2015; Xu and Hao, 2017) . In addition, the unfavorable climatic conditions, such as high temperature and humidity, and low precipitation have increased the ambient concentration levels of these recalcitrant pollutants (Table 5 ) (Farahat, 2016; Omidvarborna et al., 2018) . This situation is different in UAE, where ambient air pollutant levels, especially PMs from dust storms and trace gases from petroleum industries, are very high. Such conditions have led to high usage of air conditioners in UAE (Azar and Al Ansari, 2017; Bekhet et al., 2017; Giusti and Almoosawi, 2017; Krarti and Dubey, 2018) . According to Azuma et al. (2018) , air conditioners are one of the main sources of indoor PMs (mostly PM 0.1 ) as those fine PMs are emitted via medium efficiency particulate air filters (normally used in residential building air conditioners).",

The results showed that the ventilation rate per person (3.7 l/s) failed to meet the American society of heating, refrigerating and air-conditioning engineers (ASHRAE) threshold standard (8 l/s). It was reported that factors such as proper building orientations and efficient natural ventilations in UAE, which were depended on the building type, could reduce energy consumption by 30-79%, while improving indoor environmental quality (Friess and Rakhshan, 2017) . Fadeyi et al. (2014) reported a strong correlation (r = 0.88) of CO 2 concentration levels and ventilation systems in school buildings in Dubai. They concluded that the levels of indoor air pollutants were greatly reduced by proper ventilation systems, but at the same time, it could increase pollutant concentrations by taking infiltrated air from the outdoor environment. Although many environmentally sustainable building designs have been introduced in UAE, they have focused only on CO 2 reductions from indoor pollution other than improving ventilation systems. Therefore, since adequate ventilation mechanisms to prevent entry of outdoor pollutants have not been incorporated in the current buildings in UAE, infiltration of ambient air pollutants is now a big challenge that should be addressed (Table 6) .",

For example, in one case, IAQ modeling approach called TAS was employed to simulate environmentally sustainable school building design capable of adapting the unfavorable microclimate conditions in Makkah and Abha cities. The results showed that for a better environmental performance, including IAQ, the modeled buildings in the hot climate of Makkah natural ventilations were required, while in Abha city with moderate climate cross natural ventilations were required (Alwetaishi and Balabel, 2017) . However, El-Sharkawy and Javed (2018) argued that the major source of indoor pollution was infiltration of outdoor sources, which might be as a result of natural ventilations. In another study, CFD simulation system was employed to assess the optimum reduction of IAQ of Al-Haram mosque in Makkah. The model output revealed that indoor CO 2 levels were reduced by increasing the ventilation rate (Jaafar et al., 2017) . Hence, a study concluded that the residents of KSA would prefer of purchasing houses with improved ventilation systems to reduce indoor air pollution (Opoku and Abdul-Muhmin, 2010) . This implies environmentally sustainable building design that prevents penetration of ambient air into buildings that should be implemented in KSA (El-Sharkawy, 2014) .",

Green building rating study based on Global sustainability assessment system (GSAS) procedure was conducted in some selected buildings in Qatar.

Additionally, analysis of indoor air velocity in office buildings in Qatar, which is a critical factor in reducing build-up indoor air pollutants, showed that the indoor air velocity (0.0-0.05 m/s) in the current buildings did not meet the limits set by ASHRAE (0.18-0.25 m/s) (Indraganti and Boussaa, 2017) .

Thus, this climatic system may affect the ambient air pollution levels and subsequently IAQ, which depend primarily on the meteorological factors (Alenezi and Aldaihan, 2018) . Hence, to improve IAQ, various new green building design projects have been examined (Table 6 ). Some studies improved ventilation systems of the existing local buildings. A compartment building modeling system was applied to a typical Kuwaiti building to determine the indoor VOC levels. The results showed that an efficient indoor VOC reduction could be achieved if the ratio of makeup air to the recirculation air could fall within the range of 0.7\u22121.3 . According to Al-Hemoud et al. (2018) , application of conventional ventilation systems such as opening of doors compared to door closures in an office building did not result in a significant reduction in indoor VOC concentrations. In their study, both door opening and closure maintained VOC concentration levels of 10 ppb. Hence, new technologies should be implemented to further improve the IAQ.",

Wearing recommended respirators with improvement in sanitation practices, such as disinfections, is a potential remedy of reducing contaminations from airborne harmful microbes during Hajj (Memish et al., 2014) . Further, in order to reduce human exposure levels to bioaerosols, frequent cleaning of air conditioning filters and efficient ventilations were recommended in school buildings (Al Mijalli, 2017) . There are no studies on strategies for indoor air pollution control in Qatar. However, there are several indoor studies, where the performance of platform screen doors (PSD) and magnetic filters to remove indoor PMs have been studied (Xu and Hao, 2017) . The situation in Qatar involves very few indoor air pollution control recommendations based on specific IAQ characterization studies (Table 7) . For example, a study recommended thorough cleaning of playgrounds in all schools to avoid transportation of outdoor pollutants (PMs) to school buildings. Likewise, installation of air cleaners and frequent renovation of buildings could improve the IAQ (Abdel-Salam, 2017). Currently, there is a ban on public smoking in Qatar but the legislation exempts indoor water pipes. Al Mulla et al. (2015) suggested a ban on indoor tobacco smoking, which is one of the main causes of indoor air pollution. Finally, advanced ventilation systems could be incorporated by the current and future green buildings to reduce indoor pollutants in Qatar (Sergio et al., 2017) .",

Salient findings of IAQ based scholarly peer reviewed articles on several microenvironments in the GCC countries were summarized in this review. These encompass the major sources, characterization, measurement, and mitigation measures of different indoor air pollutants. In addition, the effects of building and ventilation designs on the quality of air based on the GCC microclimatic conditions were explored. The review of previous studies showed minor differences of indoor air pollutants in each GCC country. Throughout the entire GCC region, VOCs, NO 2 , SO 2 , PM 10 , PM 2.5 , heavy metals, and CO 2 were the most dominant indoor air pollutants found in homes, schools, caf\u00e9s, and office buildings. The main sources of these pollutants were infiltration of ambient air, burning of Arabian incense, and smoking. Other pollutants such as PAHs, Radon, bacteria, and fungi bioaerosols were well investigated in very few GCC countries, which were originated primary from overcrowding and poor ventilation systems. There was a lack of science based mitigation studies that could reduce the emission and the exposure of these pollutants in the GCC countries. However, several recommendations and precautionary measures were provided to minimize the levels of exposure. Above all, future studies should focus on 1) the advanced methods of modeling human health effects from the exposure to indoor air pollutants, and 2) further development of air purification systems.
