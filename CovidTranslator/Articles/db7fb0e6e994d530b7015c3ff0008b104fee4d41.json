The serum levels of DcR3 and its tumor necrosis factor-like ligand TL1A and homologous decoy receptor OPG were quantified by ELISA. The values of DcR3 to diagnose sepsis were analyzed by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The results showed that DcR3 was significantly elevated in sepsis compared to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), a condition similar to sepsis but resulting from noninfectious insults. DcR3 showed superior area under the ROC curve (AUC, 0.958) compared to poor AUCs of TL1A and OPG. At a cut-off of 3.24 ng/mL, DcR3 predicted sepsis from SIRS with 96% sensitivity and 82.6% specificity. DcR3 also predicted sepsis from cancer and inflammatory bowel disease with equally excellent values. Therefore, DcR3 serum level has the potential to serve as a reliable biomarker of sepsis.",

            "text": "Sepsis is a life-threatening disease resulting from the failure of our immune system to mount proper defense against invading pathogens. It is initiated by the binding of pathogen antigens to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed in immune cells that, in turn, results in the induction of various cytokines (Decker, 2004) . These cytokines then mediate numerous molecular and cellular activities that can lead to dysregulated immune responses. The clinical symptoms begin with systemic inflammatory responses and rapidly progress to multiple organ failure and ultimately death. Despite the availability of a broad spectrum of antibiotics and intensive supportive care, hospital mortality ranges from 30% to 50% for severe sepsis and septic shock (Angus et al., 2001) . The problem of effectively treating patients with sepsis is in part attributed to the difficulty of accurately diagnosing sepsis especially in its early stages. Also, incomplete understanding of the complexity of sepsis pathogenesis has hampered the invention of highly effective therapeutic strategies. Therefore, the discovery of a novel protein that possesses the potential to serve as a reliable biomarker of sepsis and to provide further insights into the mechanisms of sepsis development and progression is of significance.",

DcR3 has the closest protein sequence identity with OPG and the 2 proteins are the only receptors exclusively secreted as soluble receptors among the TNFRSF members. So far, 3 TNF family cytokines (ligands), namely, FasL (Pitti et al., 1998) , LIGHT (Yu et al., 1999) , and TL1A (Migone et al., 2002) , were identified to interact with DcR3. Once bound to DcR3, these ligands cannot bind to their cell surface-bound receptors. FasL and TL1A bind to Fas and DR3 (death receptor 3), respectively (Pitti et al., 1998; Migone et al., 2002) . LIGHT binds to both lymphotoxin-beta receptor and herpesvirus entry mediator (Zhai et al., 1998) . Like TNF, these 3 ligands belong to the type II transmembrane protein family and are first expressed as membrane-bound proteins and then cleaved off from the membrane. Both membrane-bound and soluble forms of these ligands are functional. As such, DcR3 was thought to modulate multifaceted immune responses that are mediated by the interaction between these 3 ligands and their cognate receptors.",

The selective DcR3 expression was primarily due to the preferential expression of TLR receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2/4) in APCs. Increased DcR3 levels were also detected in various human intestinal epithelial cell lines after LPS stimulation, and the increase was via TLR4 activation that led to the activation of transcriptional factor NF-\u03baB .

The SIRS group was purposely included as the negative control of sepsis. As the clinical signs between sepsis and SIRS of noninfectious causes are similar and the diagnosis of sepsis has to be confirmed by pathogen detection, it will be most useful for DcR3 to rapidly differentiate sepsis from noninfectious SIRS in ICUs. The majority of pathogens detected in the sepsis group were Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and there were 2 cases of fungi. The average ages of sepsis and SIRS patients were 65 (range 41-97) and 45 (range 18-84) years, respectively. The 20-year age difference between the 2 groups was significant (P = 0.0016), and this difference seemed to accurately reflect the widely known fact that sepsis is more common in the elderly and immunocompromised people. The average WBC counts of sepsis (16,792 cells/\u03bcL) and SIRS (16,857 cells/\u03bcL) were higher than the reference range of 4000-12,000 cells/\u03bcL, but there was no difference in the cell counts between the 2 groups. There was a significant correlation between DcR3 level and age (P = 0.0036), while no significance was found between DcR3 level and WBC (P = 0.4336). As scores for the severity of disease such as Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) were not obtained for this study, no correlation between DcR3 and the severity of disease was performed.",

However, confirmation of pathogens by cultures is slow and it often yields false-negative results (Klouche and Schr\u00f6der, 2008) . Although biomarkers cannot determine a particular pathogen like blood cultures, they can serve as rapid and inexpensive tools to discriminate sepsis from SIRS resulting from noninfectious insults in clinics. SIRS is nonspecific and can be caused by trauma, ischemia, inflammation, infection, or a combination of various insults. As antibiotics are ineffective for patients with SIRS, the differentiation between sepsis and SIRS of noninfectious causes especially in early stages of sepsis will help to reduce current practices of cautionary use of antibiotics on suspected patients. With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, this has also become a pressing issue lately. Furthermore, sepsis progresses rapidly from systemic inflammatory responses to multiple organ dysfunction and septic shock and, in these stages, antibiotics alone are ineffective to treat patients with severely dysregulated immune system resulting from the induction of numerous molecules upon the activation of TLRs by pathogens.",

However, the function of PCT, which is a precursor of calcitonin, and the regulation of PCT synthesis in sepsis are not well understood. Nevertheless, PCT was shown to be more reliable to predict sepsis from SIRS compared to other molecules expressed in sepsis including various TNF family cytokines (Pierrakos and Vincent, 2010) . PCT test is currently marketed for use in clinics (bioM\u00e9rieux, France). A recent finding showed that PCT serum level had no direct impact on prognosis, and PCT concentrations did not differ between hospital survivors and nonsurvivors (Karlsson et al., 2010) . Hence, there is still a need for having clinically relevant biomarkers that can provide better assessment of patient outcomes so that more effective therapy can be developed. DcR3 is a potent immunomodulator that can mediate numerous cellular effects in the immune system. Moreover, the regulation of DcR3 expression in response to bacterial antigens is under the control of TLRs that are known to play a key role in the innate immune system. As we reported, monocytes/macrophages and myeloid-derived dendritic cells (mDCs) selectively responded to bacterial antigens such as LPS and LTA to induce DcR3 . LTA and LPS mediate signaling preferentially via TLR2 and TLR4, respectively. Fungal antigens are also recognized by TLR2/4 (Calich et al., 2008) . In contrast to mDC, plasmacytoid-derived dendritic cells (pDCs) did not induce DcR3 release after LPS or LTA stimulation primarily due to the absence of TLR2/4 expression in pDC. Besides, pDC, which expresses TLR7/9, did not induce DcR3 release even in response to the specific ligands of TLR7/9, while it released large amounts of IFN-\u03b1 in culture supernatant. The TLR7/9 ligands were single-stranded RNA, a common feature of viral genome and CpG-DNA motif, respectively. This preferential regulation of DcR3 expression via TLR2/4 but not TLR7 might be one of the reasons that systemic acute viral inflammatory symptoms showed lack of DcR3 elevations.",

It was reported that 1 of 31 SARS patients had recovered on antibacterial treatment alone (So et al., 2003) . Antibiotics rarely work for SARS, which is caused by a virulent coronavirus. The high DcR3 serum level in 1 SARS case in our study might have been also due to secondary bacterial infection in the lung. This indicated that DcR3 serum level might be useful to distinguish between viral and bacterial acute systemic infection in emergency situations when causative agents are unknown. Besides, it has been shown already that DcR3 plasma level was significantly higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from the first day of admission and that high DcR3 level predicted the 28-day mortality independently of APACHE II scores (Chen et al., 2009) . This study only included ARDS of bacterial origin (mostly bacterial pneumonia) and thus the authors indicated that DcR3 may be a prognosticator for patients with ARDS with an infectious etiology. Therefore, DcR3 appeared to possess the potential to serve as both a diagnostic and a prognostic marker of acute systemic inflammatory symptoms of bacterial etiology.",

This mechanism was shown to be particularly important for intracellular pathogens to survive and replicate inside host cells protected from the host apoptosis immune attack (Oddo et al., 1998; Faherty and Maurelli, 2008) . Clearance of apoptotic cells by phagocytic cells plays a significant role in the resolution of inflammation (Devitt and Marshall, 2011) . Therefore, DcR3 might turn out to be a novel target of sepsis therapy.",
