Amphiregulin expression by basophils in response to anti-TCR stimulation required IL-3 produced by T cells, and IL-3 alone induced high levels of amphiregulin expression by purified basophils. Amphiregulin was expressed at much higher levels when human basophils were stimulated by IL-3 than by IgE cross-linking, whereas the opposite was true for IL-4 expression and histamine release. Heparin-binding Epidermal Growth Factor-like growth factor was also expressed by IL-3-stimulated human basophils. PBMC from asthmatic human subjects contained significantly higher numbers of basophils able to produce amphiregulin, compared to allergic or non-allergic controls.",

Although not directly addressing the role of basophils in the lung, our studies demonstrated that asthmatic subjects had increased numbers of peripheral blood basophils capable of producing AR. IL-3-dependent production of AR by human basophils could occur as part of a coordinate Type 2 response in which mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils produce AR, consistent with the correlation of AR and the mast cell and eosinophil products tryptase and ECP. The discovery that AR is produced by basophils, as well as mast cells, eosinophils and potentially Th2 cells, strongly suggests that AR is selectively produced at the site of allergic reactions and may participate in allergic reactions involving tissue remodeling, such as asthma and allergic dermatitis.",
