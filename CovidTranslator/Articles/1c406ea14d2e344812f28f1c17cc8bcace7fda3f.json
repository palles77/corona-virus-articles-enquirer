            "text": "RATIONALE: In infancy, rhinovirus illnesses and severe RSV bronchiolitis indicate increased risk for recurrent wheezing and asthma, but there is less information about other viruses. We evaluated the frequency and severity of metapneumovirus (HMPV) and coronavirus (HCV) infections in a high-risk group of infants. METHODS: Nasal lavage samples were obtained in the first year of life during scheduled study visits and symptomatic respiratory illnesses as part of the Childhood Origins of Asthma Project (COAST). Samples (n 5 567) were analyzed by Respiratory Multicode Assay (RMA) for HMPV, HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-SARS. RESULTS: HMPV was isolated in 10.7% of samples during illnesses (n 5 291), and also occurred with other respiratory viruses (4.8%). 47.8% of HMPV illnesses included wheezing. HCV were isolated in 19.2% of the samples during illnesses and included HCV-OC43 (10.0%) and HCV-NL63 (9.6%). In addition, HCV was commonly detected together with other respiratory viruses (6.5%). Of all HCV illnesses (n 5 42), 33.3% included wheezing; however, HCV-NL63 had a significantly higher wheezing rate compared to HCV-OC43 (37.5% vs. 4.5%, p 5 0.028). Children who had at least one HCV-NL63 illness during infancy were significantly more likely to have asthma at age 6 compared to those without HCV-NL63 illnesses (52.2% vs. 25.0%, p 5 0.007). Having either HCV-OC43 or HMPV was not a risk factor for asthma at age 6. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in viral diagnostics has allowed for identification of viruses that are difficult to culture. In infancy, HCV-NL63, HCV-OC43 and HMPV were significant causes of wheezing illnesses, however, only HCV-NL63 was significantly associated with asthma development at age six.",

            "text": "We hypothesize that children identified as wheezers will present with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and decreased levels of anti-viral cytokines in nasal lavage samples during symptomatic RV infection compared to non-wheezers during symptomatic RV infection. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, children enrolled in the Childhood Origins of ASThma (COAST) project provided nasal lavage samples during symptomatic respiratory infections and at scheduled well visits at ages 5 and 6 years. Children with a history of wheezing were sampled when well, during an uncomplicated cold and during a wheezing illness. Children with no history of wheezing were sampled when well and ruing an uncomplicated cold. Innate cytokine profiles were assayed using a Beadlyte\u00d2 Human Multi-Cytokine Flex Kit, and detection of the cytokines were evaluated using the Luminex 100\u00e4 IS for the following cytokines: IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 (p40), IFN-g, IFN-a, and TNF-a. Interleukin-8 levels were evaluated by ELISA. RESULTS: Interleukin-6, IL-10, IFN-g, and IL-8 were present in measurable concentrations. Concentrations of IL-6 were significantly higher during symptomatic RV infection than when well (14.6 vs. 9.91, p<0.001). The % detectability of IL-10 and IFN-g were significantly higher during symptomatic RV infection than when well (23.9 vs. 5.0, p50.045; 54.3 vs. 0, p50.022 respectively). Concentrations of IFN-g tended to be higher in non-wheezers than in wheezers during symptomatic RV infection (13.9 vs. 8.1, p50.077). CONCLUSIONS: During symptomatic RV illness, non-wheezers presented with higher levels of IFN-g than wheezers, suggesting the possibility that wheezers may have a depressed anti-viral response, which may not be as effective at fighting viral infections.
