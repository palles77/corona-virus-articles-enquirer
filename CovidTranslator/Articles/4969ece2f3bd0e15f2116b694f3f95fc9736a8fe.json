            "text": "A study of 158 pregnancies in alpacas in New Zealand reported a 25.7% pregnancy loss rate after 30 days of gestation and 9.6% to 16.7% losses occurring after day 120 of gestation. 3 In autumn-bred females, 17.3% of pregnancy losses occurred before 81 days of gestation, whereas spring-bred females had a loss rate of only 2.8% in the same gestational period. 3 Seasonal effects were not seen in other groups on a neighboring farm. In this particular study, most of the animals had been imported from Chile, and several of these animals experienced recurrent pregnancy loss over several seasons. Serial serum progesterone determination in pregnant females demonstrated a decrease to baseline of progesterone occurring simultaneously with the loss of the pregnancy in eight animals. 3 Early pregnancy loss is defined as loss of the embryo or fetus before 50 days of gestation. Frequently, no outward signs of loss are evident. However, in pregnancies beyond 35 days, small amounts of tissue or fluid may be evident, especially around the dung pile. In a large proportion of cases, the producer may suspect that the female is open because she either fails to develop abdominal distention in late gestation or may cush or be receptive in the presence of mating animals or a solitary male over a fence line. However, by the time the owner suspects that the pregnancy has been lost, it is often too late to evaluate the female clinically and reach a diagnosis. This is why pregnancy should be monitored through several examinations in the first 60 to 90 days. In our practice, we recommend pregnancy evaluations at 14, 25 to 30, and 45 to 60 days. If the female has had a history of recurrent pregnancy loss or infertility, particularly because of endometritis, another evaluation is scheduled between 80 and 90 days. This schedule allows us to monitor the pregnancy until the time when signs of fetal loss can be seen. It is also our recommendation that the females not be moved from the breeding farm during this period. During the early period, ultrasonographic signs of impending pregnancy loss include smaller-than-normal embryonic vesicle, echogenic spot (speckling) of the embryonic vesicle, absence of fetal heart beat after 25 days, poor definition of fetal structures, increased echogenicity of fetal fluid, slow growth in size, echogenic ring within the vesicle, disorganized membranes and collapsed amnion, and increased uterine edema and endometrial folds (Figure 23-1) .",

The producer may notice vaginal discharge in the pregnant female, in which case careful examination of the pasture or pen may yield the abortus. Late pregnancy losses may be preceded by clinical signs such as mammary gland development, restlessness, and colic. In many cases, the producer may find the abortus in a pasture of pregnant females and will have to identify which female lost the pregnancy. In either case, the animal which aborted must be separated from the herd and the aborted fetus and tissues collected to be submitted for laboratory investigations. As the aborted material may be infectious, the remaining pregnant females should be either moved to a clean pasture or contained in the area where the abortus was discovered with a temporary fence erected around it. If it is unknown which pregnant female aborted, all the population of females at risk may need to be reevaluated by using ultrasonography. This is also very important in case of an abortion outbreak so that some of the females in the process of aborting may be identified sooner. Owners should also be warned about the zoonotic risk of many of the abortion-causing agents.",

            "text": "When assessing for abortion in alpacas or llamas, the veterinarian must consider the history and clinical scenario: Did pregnancy loss occur in just one animal, or were multiple animals affected? The etiology of an abortion storm may include differential diagnoses that an individual abortion may not, and vice versa. At what state of gestation did the animal experience the loss? The history of the animal is crucial. Breeding records, vaccine history, and method of diagnosis of pregnancy are crucial to assessing for an abortion. If no diagnosis of pregnancy was performed and no fetus was expelled, often the question becomes, was this animal pregnant at all? In these cases, the issue may not be one of abortion but of infertility. Also, records may demonstrate that recurrent pregnancy loss in the particular animal may have been caused by physical or hormonal abnormalities. Last, examination of the animal's diet, prophylactic program, travel schedule, and history of previous illnesses, including any administered medications, may help define the cause of abortion. A B C D elsewhere in this text. Areas of reduced or absent chorionic villi may correspond to areas of uterine fibrosis or presence of twins. Histopathologically, evidence of inflammation, infection, or placental insufficiency may be identified. If the placenta cannot be submitted in its entirety, samples should be obtained from the cervical region, the body of the uterus, and the base, middle, and tip of each horn, as well as from any abnormal-looking area. Samples from lesions should have wide margins, including both normal and abnormal looking areas. Samples should be taken in duplicates and submitted fresh on ice and fixed in 10% formalin ( Figure 23-3) . Particular attention should be given to the number of placentas and the anatomy of the umbilical cord. Impression smear from the chorionic surface are often very helpful in the diagnosis of bacterial or fungal placentitis. The fetus should ideally be submitted in its entirety to the diagnostic laboratory. Evaluation of the aborted fetus should include weight measurements (crown-rump length) to estimate gestational age and rule out intrauterine growth retardation. Formulas for the estimation of gestational age are available but are not always accurate (Table 23-1) . Examination of the surface of the body may reveal lesions suggesting bacteriologic examination. External examination and necropsy should be very thorough and may reveal severe developmental abnormalities or evidence of infection. Fluid should be aspirated aseptically from the pleural and abdominal cavities as well as from the fetal stomach and submitted for microbiologic analysis. Tissue samples from any grossly abnormal areas and from all major organs (i.e., liver, lung, kidney, adrenal gland, placenta, heart-thymus, brain, spleen, and small intestine) should be taken for histopathology and immunohistochemistry. 4 Cardiac blood and frozen sections of the liver and brain should be provided for toxicologic studies.",

The Examination of the female should include a thorough physical examination. Young females bred before they achieved 63% of adult weight and height have a higher risk of pregnancy loss because of immaturity. Females with poor body condition or severe weight loss may also experience pregnancy loss, particularly in harsh winters ( Figure 23 -2). Serum may be collected for trace mineral assay, as deficiencies or excess may cause fetal loss. Ultrasonographic examination of the uterus may demonstrate fluid or membrane retention. Uterine culture should be performed using a double-guarded swab and an appropriate culture medium to transport the specimen to the laboratory. A vaginal examination will demonstrate any cervical damage or vaginal lacerations that commonly occur in late-term abortion because sufficient cervical dilation often does not occur before fetal expulsion.

A more detailed account on the examination of the placenta is given Initially, an animal is infected by the virus through exposure to an infected animal; it is hypothesized that BVDV was introduced into camelid populations from contact with infected cattle. Seroconversion and virus shedding occurs, and the animal either shows signs of illness or maintains subclinical infection. Clinical infection is manifested by immunosuppression and subsequent secondary bacterial or viral infections. Commonly affected systems include the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and lymphatic systems, although diarrhea does not seem to be a component of disease in alpacas or llamas. Subclinical infection may not be apparent besides transient fever, inappetance, lethargy, and changes in fleece quality. 7 If the infected animal is pregnant, the fetus may be affected in one of several ways. In early gestation, early embryonic death may occur; or in cattle, congenital malformations such as cerebellar hypoplasia, hydrocephalus, microphthalmia, and various other craniofacial, neural, and ocular defects have been reported. 8 No congenital defects due to infection with BVDV have been reported in alpacas or llamas. 9 Births of persistently infected crias have been documented. 7, 10, 11 In cattle, it is known that infection of the pregnant cow before 125 days of pregnancy results in the birth of a persistently infected (PI) animal. This period of immuno-naivety in the pregnancy of alpacas or llamas is not currently known. However, a study of an outbreak on a farm showed that the transplacental infection rate was 82%, resulting in the birth of a PI cria in 70% of the cases (n = 10) when pregnant females were exposed between 64 and 114 days of pregnancy. 12 Because of the great variability of pregnancy length, determination of the exact period of susceptibility is very costly. However, on the basis of available information, it may be assumed that this period ranges between 45 and 120 days of pregnancy. During this stage, the fetus is not immunocompetent, and infection by the virus is not recognized by the fetus as non-self; thus, no antibodies to the virus are ever formed. The fetus then becomes tolerant to the infection, and if it survives , the neonate then serves as a source of viral shedding in the herd. 11, 13 The final clinical picture is a female that becomes infected late in gestation when the fetus has developed a functional immune system. In these cases, the fetus will mount an antibody response, seroconvert, and usually recover along with the dam. Abortion may occur at any stage of gestation or a weak PI cria may be born prematurely.",

The PI animal itself may appear clinically normal but will continue to shed viral particles or may suffer from ill-thrift and secondary infections. 8 In cattle, PI animals may develop full-blown mucosal disease, which is highly fatal; this has not been reported in camelids and crias, which tend to develop chronic disease. 9 A recent study has shown that chronically infected and persistently infected crias have poor growth rate and often show anemia and monocytosis. The most common clinical symptoms include chronic wasting, diarrhea, and respiratory diseases. About 50% of the animals will die in the first 6 month of life. 12 Of primary importance to prevent or minimize BVDV infection on a farm is to segregate pregnant females from PI crias or transiently infected animals and from any cattle, sheep, or goats to prevent interspecies transmission from positive animals, although the roles of other domestic species in transmission to camelids are not completely elucidated. PI crias diagnosis rate rarely reaches 30% of all submissions. 5 This may be attributed to lack of sufficient clinical and laboratory data and lack of expertise in camelid pathology. As in other species, causes of abortion in alpacas and llamas fall into distinct categories: infectious and noninfectious. Noninfectious causes of abortion may be sporadic or affect several animals in a herd, as in the case of abortions caused by nutritional deficiencies or administration of some drugs. Infectious abortions are further subdivided into the types of organisms responsible: viruses, bacteria, protozoa, or fungi. Noninfectious causes of abortion may be categorized as maternal causes, fetal causes, nutritional causes, and iatrogenic causes.

However, very little evidence exists for the role of these organisms in pregnancy loss in camelid species, although leptospiral organisms are a significant cause of abortion in other domestic large animals, including horses and cattle. The most common isolates were L. interrogans serogroups Ictero haemorrhagiae and Ballum. Another study in Peru demonstrated that 79.24% of tested alpacas were seropositive for the serogroup Pomona and that seroprevalence was associated with the rainy season. 27 In a report from Oregon, L. Pomona and L. grippotyphosa were identified as possible causes of abortion on have been shown to shed the virus in all body fluid and are an important source of contamination. 13 Viral isolates from camelids have not completely matched those that infect other ruminants, and geographic location seems to be implicated in camelid disease in North America, as a majority of BVDV cases in camelids reported no contact of affected animals with cattle or sheep. 6, 9 It is recommended that producers take precautions with female alpacas or llamas that travel to another farm for breeding along with their suckling cria and develop an isolation protocol for animals that travel for shows. It is recommended that a BVDV screening program be put into effect, with no less than 10% or 15 animals in the herd tested. 9 Suckling crias may have circulating antibodies from the dam's milk or if fed bovine colostrum. 9 Research of pestiviral infection in camelids has been focused in three main areas: (1) determining the seropositivity of various herds through epidemiologic studies; (2) clinical examination of affected animals; and (3) experimental inoculation of animals with BVDV. The seropositive rate in epidemiologic studies has been widely variable and demonstrated camelids infected with BVDV types 1a, 1b, and 2, with 1b being the most common. 6 Experimental inoculation of pregnant llamas demonstrated seroconversion of the dams but no other clinical effects. 14 One experimentally infected llama aborted 5 months after infection, but no BVDV was found in the fetus. 14 Diagnosis of BVDV infection in an alpaca or llama is similar to that in cattle. Virus isolation from tissue samples of aborted fetuses may be performed; preferred tissues are blood, lymph nodes, and placenta. 15 Immunohistochemistry may be performed on formalin-fixed tissues of an abortus as well. 15 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may be performed on whole blood samples and is the most common screening method of infection in neonatal crias. Serology of whole blood will provide antibody titers to demonstrate seroconversion, although it will not distinguish active infection from prior exposure. The recommendation following a diagnosis of a PI cria is euthanasia and identification of any other infected animals in the herd to minimize propagation of the disease.",

However, two llamas had rising T. gondii titers and suffered abortion. 45 Fetal fluids from one of the aborted crias were positive for T. gondii antibodies. In contrast, a study of 50 aborted fetuses in Peru did not demonstrate any T. gondii DNA in analyzed tissues. 41 On the basis of these studies, toxoplasmosis does not appear to be a common cause of abortion in alpacas and llamas; however, producers should minimize the amount of contact between naive camelids and cats, the definitive host of T. gondii, as well as keeping the feed covered.",

L. monocytogenes was cultured from the fetal liver and lung, and diffuse placental lesions were noted on histopathology. A uterine culture of the affected female was obtained but could not be processed by the laboratory. The female became pregnant 30 days after the abortion, and no other animals on the property were affected. The llama was subsequently found to be infected with Myco plasma hemolamae, which has been associated with immunosuppression. Neonatal cases of septicemia caused by L. monocytogenes are mostly attributed to failure of passive transfer, although negative uterine cultures after parturition are often not available to rule out maternal infection and transplacental infection. 32, 33 Abortion caused by Campylobacter fetus was reported in alpacas in the United Kingdom. 34 Four abortions and one premature nonviable cria were born to females in late pregnancy over a 6-week period. Sheep were present on the farm but were geographically separated and had no abortions that year. Two aborted fetuses were examined. One placenta demonstrated a focal area of necrosis and the other generalized necrotic placentitis. Organisms were isolated from placental tissue as well as from fetal stomach contents. One dam was found to have a swollen tongue with a diphtheritic membrane, which may have been unrelated to Campylobacter infection. Fecal cultures of remaining pregnant alpacas demonstrated the organism in 36% of animals. Four of the five affected females were bred and became pregnant within 31 and 150 days of abortion. In sheep, it has been demonstrated that infection results in protective immunity for several years; it is not known if this occurs in camelids. Differentials for lateterm abortion in camelids with placental lesions and exposure to sheep should include C. fetus, although further investigation into this pathogen in these species is warranted. However, it is important to differentiate abortion caused by Campylo bacter spp. from those caused by Campylobacter-like organisms such as Arcobacter spp., which has also been isolated from an alpaca abortus. 35 Q-fever, caused by Coxiella burnetii, is a well-established cause of abortion in camels and present serious risks to human health. 4 To date, the implication of this organism in alpaca and llama abortions has not been reported. More investigation of its role in abortion in these species is warranted.",

Because the corpus luteum (CL) is required for pregnancy maintenance, any administration of PGF 2\u03b1 or its analogues will result in luteolysis and pregnancy loss. Induction of abortion may be intentional in cases of unwanted pregnancy. Both dinoprost tromethamine and cloprostenol have been shown to be efficacious in induction of abortion in camelids throughout pregnancy. 47, 48 The interval from treatment to abortion is generally 3 to 7 days. Pregnancy length does not seem to have an effect on the interval from treatment to abortion. However, females in advanced stages of pregnancy (>150 days) may experience more discomfort. Induction of abortion is sometimes warranted for management or medical reasons. Administration of cloprostenol (250 micrograms [mcg], intramuscularly [IM]) twice with a 24-hour interval has been shown to reliably induce abortion between 4 and 7 months of pregnancy. The majority (92.5%) of animals aborted 3 days (45.2%) or 4 days (37.7%) following a single series of injections. A small proportion of animals may require a second series of cloprostenol administration. 48 Fertility following induction of abortion was similar to nontreated control females. 48 In our experience, both cloprostenol (125 to 250 mcg, IM) and dinoprost tromethamine (5 mg, IM) induce abortion at any stage of pregnancy in alpacas. The interval from treatment to abortion seems to be slightly shorter in alpacas (2 to 4 days). It is important to note that PGF 2\u03b1 or its analogues may also reliably induce parturition in term alpacas and llamas. 49 The administration of corticosteroids during the last trimester of gestation will result in pregnancy loss. 50 In pregnancies in ruminants, increased levels of cortisol interrupt normal function of trophoblast cells, and a similar mechanism is suspected in alpacas and llamas. Pregnancy loss is characterized in alpacas and llamas by premature placental separation resulting in fetal death, release of PGF 2\u03b1 from the endometrium, and expulsion of the nonviable fetus. Pregnancy loss from administration of topical steroid-containing ophthalmic solutions has been observed in 4 pregnant females (5 to 8 months) in our clinic (A. Tibary, clinical observation). Induction of parturition with dexamethasone results in in utero fetal death. 49 The use of multivalent vaccines in pregnant female alpacas and llamas has also been associated with early-gestation pregnancy loss. This loss seems to be mostly associated with 8-way vaccines against Clostridium spp. 50 We do not recommend vaccination of pregnant females in the first 90 days of gestation, if possible. of twins in alpacas and llamas has been reported in North America, Australia, and New Zealand. As in other large domestic animal species, nearly all twins are conceived from double ovulations. The rate of double ovulations in alpacas and llamas is estimated to be 8% to 10% of all cycles. A tendency for increased ovulation rate is seen in animals with good body condition. However, a genetic predisposition for twinning may also exist, as some females have a tendency to double ovulate and conceive twins repeatedly. Hormonal induction of ovulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) has been suspected to increased double ovulation, but this has not been confirmed in controlled studies.",

We have seen cases of self-reduced twin pregnancy in which the retained fetus was in the right horn of the dam's uterus. Such cases should be flagged by the veterinarian as high-risk pregnancies, as the right horn is typically smaller, and an increased risk for late abortion may exist. Despite the tendency for early self-reduction, cases of aborted twin fetuses later in gestation have been reported; this highlights the need for early and accurate diagnosis. Pregnancy diagnosis should not be limited to a checkup if the female is pregnant but should include evaluation of the size of the embryonic vesicle, examination of both uterine horns, and, most importantly, examination of both ovaries for quality and number of corpora lutea. Anytime a double ovulation (two corpora lutea) is identified in the pregnancy diagnosis at 14 days, the females should be closely monitored for presence of twins and their location. This can be easily done by detection of two fetal heart beats or concepti proper by day 25. Our recommendation is to eliminate both twins if they are bilateral. If the twins are unilateral, another evaluation is scheduled between 30 and 45 days of pregnancy. If the pregnancy is not reduced to a singleton by this time, a decision to abort both should be considered. Termination of pregnancy is reliably achieved by administration of two doses of cloprostenol (250 mcg, IM) with a 24-hour interval. Abortion at this stage of pregnancy does not have any effect on the welfare and future fertility of the dam compared with late-term abortion or even the birth of twins, which may cause dystocia and damage to the cervix. 2 The twins are generally aborted anytime during mid-to late pregnancy in various degrees of autolysis (most of the cases we have observed are between 4 and 7 months). They are usually of unequal size and smaller than the normal gestation age (Figure 23-5) . Although rare, conjoined twins are possible and may cause dystocia during abortion (Figure 23-6 ). Birth of a normal cria with the mummified remains of a twin is possible. Females with recurrent twinning on consecutive cycles after abortion have been documented (Dietrich Volkmann, personal communication). In these cases, monitoring of follicular dynamics and reduction of nutritional plan may help reduce the chances of double recommend that any female that is placed on progesterone supplementation therapy during pregnancy be frequently evaluated with ultrasonography to assess fetal development and viability. The use of progesterone therapy in maiden females for maintenance of pregnancy should be discouraged.

Similar mechanisms are suspected in alpacas and llamas, which is why many producers choose to breed their female animals in the spring or fall to avoid early fetal development and possible pregnancy loss during the hottest days of summer. Stress from travel by trailer for as little as 30 minutes resulted in increased cortisol levels in alpacas for several hours. 57 Systemic disease may also result in pregnancy loss; production of cortisol may be implicated (especially if the animal is moved to a veterinary clinic, is stabled alone, is handled often, or undergoes multiple treatments, anesthesia, or both); or the pregnant female may be so debilitated that in an effort to meet her own metabolic needs the pregnancy is self-terminated.

Topical oil-based antibiotics such as triple antibiotic ointment or antibioticimpregnated lanolin (without corticosteroids) may be applied to the exposed tissue for protection. The tail should be kept clean, and the female should be placed in a dry environment to minimize the risk of ascending infection. 4, 60 Severe cases of vaginal prolapse are likely to involve not only the vagina but also the cervix and the urinary bladder (Figure 23-9) . Once the prolapse has occurred, the female will be unable to resolve it on her own. If the prolapse was identified early, prompt treatment will result in the least amount of tissue damage. Epidural anesthesia is often not required but may be considered in severe cases. The tissue is cleaned with a very dilute mild antiseptic solution such as described in a 3-year-old alpaca that developed ketosis in the 11th month of pregnancy. 59 After a 2-week period of anorexia, depression, and weight loss, clinicopathologic evaluation demonstrated ketonuria, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and increases in serum liver enzymes, \u00df-hydroxybutyrate, and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs). Azotemia and hyperlipidemia are often observed in some females. In severely debilitated females, induction of abortion or parturition should be considered to alleviate the syndrome. 49",

Sedation and or epidural anesthesia may be required for palpation per rectum. Most uterine torsions in camelids are precervical in nature, and a vaginal examination either by palpation or speculum will not demonstrate any spiraling of the vagina. Therefore, the most definitive means of diagnosis is palpation of the broad ligaments, noting the degree of tension and location of the fetus. The location of the fetus is often more cranial than normal and difficult to palpate. In clockwise torsion, the left broad ligament stretches diagonally from the left side to the right side of the animal as a tight band running over the uterine body, whereas the right broad ligament is shorter and trapped under the body of the uterus (Figure 23-11) . Determination of the direction of the torsion may be very difficult in some situations, and exploratory laparotomy should be performed in these cases. Camelids ovulate equally from both ovaries but only carry their fetus in the left uterine horn. This has been proposed as the main reason for a higher incidence of clockwise uterine torsion in alpacas and llamas. 65 However, a significant number of counterclockwise torsion still occurs. 63, 64 The occurrence of counterclockwise torsion cannot be explained by pregnancies in the right horn. However, we have observed an abnormal fetal position in several cases of term uterine torsion, which suggests that this may be a factor.",

Uterine torsion is suspected to be the leading cause of dystocia in alpaca and llamas. [61] [62] [63] Factors involved in the etiopathogenesis of uterine torsion are mostly speculative. The rolling behavior of the dam and the size of the fetus are often cited as the main contributing factors. A tendency towards increased incidence during the summer months is suspected to be related to increased dusting behavior. It is interesting to note that uterine torsion is rarely mentioned in the South American literature as a significant problem compared with North America and Australia. This geographic difference may be explained by the small birth weights and smaller body size of alpacas in South America. Another major difference is the extreme variation in the duration of pregnancy in llamas and alpacas observed outside of South America, which may be a contributing factor.",

Acute unrelenting pain is rarely an initial sign unless the torsion is severe. Uterine torsion is unlikely to be a sudden phenomenon but rather a progressive complication of a partially rotated uterus. Fetal movements and rolling of the dam may contribute to the final stages of torsion. Females may have decreased appetite, visit the manure pile frequently, quick at her abdomen, or lie in lateral recumbency. In advanced cases, depression, diarrhea, and anorexia may be the only clinical signs. Astute producers may notice a slight listlessness and less activity than normal. If the torsion is slight, often the female will not show signs of debilitation as the uterine vasculature will continue to supply the organ. The female may continue to eat and defecate normally. In severe torsions, the uterine vasculature may become occluded, leading to compromise of the uterus and the fetus. Additionally, the more severe the rotation, the more tension is placed on the broad ligament, which will cause more severe pain and clinical signs in the animal. The female may show tachycardia, tachypnea, and increased vocalization. It is important to note that approximately 30% of the cases referred to our service because of discomfort in late pregnancy are not cases of uterine torsion. Noticeable discomfort is often seen in maiden late-term females. neck to prevent injury to the female. Often placing a towel over the female's eyes calms the animal. Another person controls the front limbs and shoulder, and the third person controls the hindlimbs and hips. The person guiding the rolling process uses hand pressure to stabilize the fetus and the uterus of the female. As the female is rolled from right lateral to dorsal to left lateral to sternal recumbency, the person manipulating the fetus will attempt to hold the fetus stationary as the female rolls around it. This may be accomplished by the handler using just the hands or sometimes the hand on top and the knee on the side. The handler may feel the fetus slip as the torsion resolves or partially resolves. Once rolled to sternal recumbency, the female is repositioned as before and rolled again in the same manner. This process is repeated three to four times, and the female is then placed in sternal position and examined via transrectal palpation. Successful correction is recognized by easy identification of both broad ligaments and easy access to the uterus and the fetus. It is not possible to overroll the animal and cause a uterine torsion in the opposite direction. In large llamas, the procedure is similar, but heavy sedation of the animal is required. The use of a plank to hold the fetus in place is more practical for rolling llamas. Correction should not take more than four or five rolling attempts. The most critical aspect of correction of uterine torsion by rolling is to roll the female slowly, making sure that the fetus is always held firmly in place.",

            "text": "The surgical approach should be considered if the rolling is not successful or if the female is increasingly uncomfortable. Surgical treatment options are based on the stage of pregnancy at which the uterine torsion occurs and the size of the animal. If the fetus is at term or severely compromised or if the female is debilitated, a cesarean section may be warranted. Surgical correction should also be attempted when the diagnosis is made by exploratory laparotomy. The uterus may be gently rolled within the abdomen via a midline incision. Flooding the abdominal cavity with lactated Ringer solution helps with the correction. In the llama, surgical approaches to the gravid uterus include a ventral midline celiotomy and a left flank laparotomy. 63 Flank laparotomy may be more advantageous in larger debilitated animals or in field settings. In the alpaca, ventral midline celiotomy is the preferred approach, although in debilitated animals, respiratory failure is a significant risk because of the small lung field in these species and the fetus. 61 Fetal heart rates greater than 130 beats per minute (beats/min) may indicate fetal stress, and rates less than 50 beats/min may encourage the practitioner to consider cesarean section immediately and bypass any attempts to roll the alpaca to correct the torsion. Ultrasonographic examination of the uterus and the placenta will also yield important information about the health of the uterus and the pregnancy. A severe or chronic uterine torsion will lead to increased uterine wall thickness and, if the female is in active labor, potentially placental separation (Figure 23-12) . Measurements of the uterine wall may dictate whether rolling of the dam poses a substantial risk for uterine rupture, as thickened walls may be edematous or friable. In most cases of mild to moderate uterine torsion with normal fetal heart rates and normal uterine wall appearance and thickness on ultrasonographic examination, rolling the female is a viable first option for treatment. Most new portable ultrasound machines are equipped with color Doppler imaging. This feature is extremely important for the evaluation of uterine perfusion but most importantly of fetal viability, as it is often very difficult to ascertain fetal death. If the heart is not accessible, the clinician may use Doppler ultrasound on fetal aorta or richly vascularized organs such as the liver or the kidney. Blood flow within the umbilical cord may also be verified.",

It is crucial to accurately diagnose the direction of torsion, as this will dictate the direction of rolling. Females are rolled in the same direction as that of the torsion. For clockwise torsions, the female is placed on the ground in right lateral recumbency. In field-settings, a grass pasture or lawn is ideal; in hospital settings, a padded floor or mat may be used. Three to four people are required for a safe, successful rolling attempt. One person controls the head and biomechanics involved when the animal is placed in dorsal recumbency. Care must be taken when detorsing the uterus, as it may be edematous and friable, even if not noted on ultrasonographic examination. Manipulation of the uterus should be minimal and done with care, especially if the fetus is pre-term. The surgeon should palpate the broad ligaments directly and determine or confirm the direction of torsion. In the midline approach, correction is relatively easy. The surgeon should hold the tip of the pregnant horn and the fetal part engaged with it firmly with one hand while holding the rest of the fetal body and uterus by placing pressure on them with the flat hand. The fetus is then rocked against the direction of the torsion. In severe torsion, this may need to be done in two steps. For flank correction, the incision should allow the surgeon to use two hands. The fetus is rotated by gently pushing against the direction of the torsion with one hand while the other hand pulls the fetus and pregnant horn. In term pregnancy, the fetus should be delivered before any attempt is made to correct the torsion. Surgical risks are not unlike those for other abdominal procedures, and attention should be paid to keeping ventral midline incisions clean and bandaged postoperatively to prevent secondary infection and dehiscence, especially if the female delivers per vaginum shortly following surgery, as this places considerable strain on the suture line. For this reason, removal of term fetuses by cesarean section may be a good option. Blood work should be performed when surgical treatment is pursued. At the very minimum, in nondebilitated animals, packed cell volume (PCV) and serum total protein (TP) should be assessed. In debilitated animals, a complete blood cell count and complete serum biochemistry analysis should be performed prior to general anesthesia, and any electrolyte abnormalities, dehydration, or shock should be treated prior to induction of anesthesia by intravenous administration of fluids. A venous catheter is readily placed in the animal's right jugular vein and provides direct circulatory access. Care must be taken with fluid administration rates, as the small lung field of camelids predisposes them to pulmonary edema in cases of volume overload.",
