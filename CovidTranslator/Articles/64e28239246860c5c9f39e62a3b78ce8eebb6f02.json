The characteristics of the biology and intracellular viral RNA synthesis and the intracellular viral protein synthesis of JHMV are discussed in the two previous papers, respectively. This paper describes the neuropathogenesis of JHMV and the isolation and characterization of 34 temperature-sensitive mutants of JHMV. These mutants were selected for their inability to induce syncytia formation after low multiplicity infection (m.o.i. = 0.1 iU) in BALB/c 17CL-1 cells at 38.5\" as compared to the induction of syncytia at 33\". N-Methyl-N '-nitrosoguanidine (14 mutants) and Wluorouridine (20 mutants) were used as mutagens at a concentration that reduced infectivity by 90-95%. Characterization of these mutants included: induction of syncytia; synthesis of JHMV-specific intracellular RNA; progeny yields at 33, 37, and 38.5\"; synthesis of JHMV-specific antigens as dctcrmined by indirect immunofluorescence and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; virion thermostability; neuropathogenesis including isolation of virus from infected brain, immunofluorescence of infected brain, and histopathology of brain and spinal cord by light and transmission electron microscopy; ability to protect mice from a lethal JHMV infection; and complementation. RNA-minus (17/34), , and RNAplus (3/34) groups were defined. One mutant, N3, produces chronic meningitis and demyelination without typical JHMV encephalitis in spite of the fact that neurons are infected as detected by immunofluorescence. This altered neuropathogenesis cannot be explained by \"leakiness\" or reversion. In addition, non-temperature-sensitive variants of JHMV have been selected for altered neuropathogenesis and are described.",

            "text": "The growth and titration of methods of JHMV and A59V in 17CL-1 cells are presented in the first of the two previous papers (Robb and Bond, 197913) . The doubly cloned JHMV wild-type (wt) \"parent\" (Robb and Bond, 1979b) was subjected to N-methyl-N'-nitrosaguanidine (NTG) or 5-fluorouridine (5FU) mutagenesis. The concentration of each drug was chosen so that infectivity was reduced by 90-95% after mutagenesis. Cells were infected in suspension with a m.o.i. = 0.10. After a 30-min adsorption at 33\" with agitation every 5 min, the cells were either treated with NTG or 5FU in the following manner. NTG: Infected cells were plated into MultiWell plates (Falcon) using 6 x lo5 cells per well in 1.0 ml DEBZ. After a 4-hr incubation at 33\", 4 pug of NTG in 8 ,ul of sterile deionized water was added to each well. After an additional 4-hr incubation at 33\", the NTG-containing medium was aspirated, the wells rinsed once with 1.0 ml DEBZ, and the cells incubated with 1.0 ml DEB2 per well for an additional 16 hr at 33\". 5FU: Infected cells were plated into MultiWell plates at 6 x lo5 cells per well in 1.0 ml DEB2 containing 500 ,ug/ml 5FU. After a 6-hr incubation at 33\", the medium was aspirated, the infected cells were rinsed once with 1.0 ml DEB2 per well, and the cells incubated with 1.0 ml DEB2 per well for an additional 18 hr at 33\". A modified version of the previously described (Robb, 1973) replica-plating microtechnique for the isolation of ts animal virus mutants was developed. The modification was necessary because the titer of any given clone of JHMV was not high enough for reproducible replica plating. Three types of plastic culture vessels (Falcon) were used: the mutagenesis procedure used MultiWell plates with 24 wells/plate and 1.0 ml/well; the procedure for cloning mutagenized virus used Microtest plates with 60 wells/plate and 10 pi/well (\"master plates\"); and the replica plating procedure used Microtest II plates with 96 wells/plate and 0.10 ml/well (\"replica plates\"). The mutagenized viruses from a single MultiWell were plated into Microtest master plates at a dilution that would infect about half of the 60 wells in each plate. This initial plating of mutagenized virus used a sterile Hamilton syringe with repeating dispenser to inocu-late each \"master well\" with the virus and 1000 17CL-1 cells in 10 ,ul of DEB2 (Robb, 1973) . These master wells were incubated at 33\" for 48 hr and all infected wells were replica plated into two Microtest II replica plates in the following manner. Each \"replica well\" was first filled with 0.10 ml of DEB2 containing 4 x lo4 17CL-1 cells. Five microliters from an infected master well was then added to each of two corresponding replica wells of the two replica plates. When all the master wells derived from a single MultiWell were replica plated into replica wells, one set of replica wells was placed at 38.5\" and the other set at 33\". After a subsequent 48-hr incubation at the respective temperatures, the replica wells were examined with phase contrast microscopy for the presence of JHMVspecific syncytia formation.",

The cells in the 33\" replica well containing the presumed mutant were scraped with a sterile rubber policeman, sonically disrupted, and cloned by the endpoint dilution microtechnique (Robb and Bond, 1979b) . Two clones of a potential mutant were then picked from each of the independent isolates, incubated with 5 x lo5 17CL-1 cells in 0.5 ml DEB2 at 33\", plated into individual wells of a Multi-Well plate with an additional 0.5 ml DEBB, and incubated at 33\". Each of the two clones thus grown was harvested and titered at 33 and 38.5\". The clone with the greatest inhibition of syncytia formation at 38.5\" (reduction in the 38.5\" titer) was grown into a stock of mutant virus and the other clone was destroyed. Only mutants having a lOOO-fold or greater reduction in their ability to form syncytia at 38.5\" were studied further. The \"restrictive\" temperature of 38.5\" was chosen to provide the largest temperature differential (33\" vs 38.5\") while staying within the body temperature of a mouse (37-39\"). Perma-nent designations will be assigned to each mutant according to the nomenclature for animal viruses developed for mutants (Robb, et al., 1972) after the affected protein or complementation group has been identified.",
