The vaccine candidate elicited strong antigenicity in dogs in respect of specific SGE and Leishmania humoral immune response. The major saliva proteins recognized by serum from immunized dogs exhibited molecular weights of 35 and 45 kDa, and were related to the resistance pattern against Leishmania infection. Immunophenotypic analysis revealed increased circulating CD21 + B-cells * Corresponding authors atet al. and CD5 + T-cells, reflected by higher counts of CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells. The observed interaction between potential antigen-presenting cells (evaluated as CD14 + monocytes) and lymphocyte activation status indicated a relationship between innate and adaptive immune responses. The higher frequency in L. chagasi antigen-specific CD8 + T-lymphocytes, and their positive association with intense cell proliferation, in addition to the progressively higher production of serum nitric oxide levels, showed a profile compatible with anti-CVL vaccine potential. Further studies on immunological response after challenge with L. chagasi may provide important information that will lead to a better understanding on vaccine trial and efficacy.",

The act of probing and feeding by an infected female sand fly introduces into the host both secretions from the salivary gland of the fly and promastigotes of L. chagasi [2] . It is known that the saliva of L. longipalpis possesses apyrase, anticoagulant, vasodilatory and immunomodulatory activities that could facilitate evasion of the inflammatory and immune responses of the host [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Furthermore, initial studies with Leishmania major [8] demonstrated that sand fly saliva exacerbates host infection, and similar findings have been reported for a number of different species of Leishmania [2, [9] [10] [11] .",

Morris et al. [14] reported that animals vaccinated with maxadilan, a potent vasodilator and immunomodulator from L. longipalpis, were protected against L. major infection. Additionally, mice that had been vaccinated with a 15 kDa salivary protein (PpSP15) from sand flies were immune to infection by L. major when challenged with promastigotes and saliva [15] . These data support the hypothesis that induction of an immune response to salivary proteins of the sand fly may facilitate a protective immune response against Leishmania infection.",

Moreover, although the current strategy for vaccination against leishmaniasis is based on the use of recombinant antigens, whole parasite vaccines are still attractive in terms of cost, safety, and stability of their biochemical composition and antigenicity. Trials utilizing such vaccines have already been undertaken [27] , and several studies involving the dog model have revealed that crude antigen vaccines elicit strong cell reactivity against Leishmania antigens [28] [29] [30] [31] .

A total of 15,000 events were acquired for each preparation. Canine WBL were selected on the basis of their characteristic forward (FSC) and side (SSC) light-scatter distributions. Following FSC and SSC gain adjustments, the lymphocytes were selected by gating on the FSC versus SSC graph. Fluorescence was evaluated from FITC, PE and PE-Cy5 spectra, respectively, on FL1, FL2 and FL3 in single-histogram representations. Monocytes were analysed by fluorescence intensity detection on single histograms obtained directly from un-gated leukocytes. A marker was set as an internal control for non-specific binding in order to encompass >98% of unlabelled cells, and this marker was then used in the analysis of data for a given animal. The results were expressed as the percentage of positive cells within the selected gate for cell surface markers presenting bimodal distributions (CD5, CD4, CD8 and CD21). Semiquantitative analyses were carried out for the cell surface markers MHC-I and CD80, which exhibited unimodal distributions, in order to evaluate differential expression, and the results were expressed as mean fluorescence channel (MFC) on a log scale. Data were also expressed as absolute counts in order to allow the normalization of values obtained from groups presenting different overall leukocyte counts. The absolute counts for lymphocytes and monocytes were calculated as (global leukocyte counts \u00d7 percentage of lymphocytes or monocytes in hematoscopy)/100.

Addi- tionally, the LBSal group presented higher (P < 0.05) CD5 + T-cell counts at T2 compared with the Sap and Sal group Circulating CD4 + and CD8 + T-lymphocytes were the major Tcell subsets contributing to the enhanced CD5 + T-lymphocyte counts in the LBSapSal profile. In this context, increased (P < 0.05) CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell counts were observed at T1 in the LBSapSal group compared with, respectively, the C, Sap, Sal and LBSal groups, and the C, Sap and Sal groups. Similarly, the CD21 + B-lymphocyte count exhibited a significant increase in the LBSapSal group compared with the C, Sap, Sal and LBSal groups at T1, although there was a significant decrease in the number of CD21 + B-cells in the LBSal group compared with the C group at T2 and T3.

Alongside increased CD14 + monocyte counts, the lymphocyte activation status in the LBSapSal group exhibited increased (P < 0.05) mean fluorescence channel levels in gated lymphocytes for CD80 at T2 compared with the C and Sal groups (Fig. 5, upper middle panel) , and for the cell surface marker MHC-I at T3 compared with the C group (Fig. 5, upper right panel) . Additionally, the LBSal group showed a reduction (P < 0.05) in expression of MHC-I in lymphocytes at T1 compared with the C and Sal groups. Correlation analysis was employed to investigate the relationship between the increase in CD14 + monocytes (at T1) followed by the improvement in lymphocyte activation status (CD80 at T2 and MHC-I at T3) in the LBSapSal group (Fig. 5, middle panel) . Interestingly, the increase in counts of CD14 + monocytes at T1 was positively correlated with the lymphocyte activation profile in respect of the differential expression of CD80 (P = 0.0252; r = 0.9748) at T2 and MHC-I (P = 0.0241; r = 0.9759) at T3. Further investigation revealed a positive correlation in the LBSapSal group between lymphocyte expression of CD80 at T2 and of MHC-1 at T3 (P = 0.0063; r = 0.9937). These data point to the connectivity of events between APC and lymphocyte activation status, and also among lymphocyte activation profile markers during immunization with LBSapSal. In agreement with these findings, it was observed that dogs of the LBSap-Sal group displaying higher CD14 + monocyte counts at T1 also exhibited the highest levels of expression of CD80 at T2 and MHC-I at T3 in lymphocytes (Fig. 5, middle right  panel) .",

For these reasons, the canine model is considered to offer an excellent system for application in studies concerned with leishmaniasis in man [47] [48] [49] . Moreover, the natural history of CVL has been well described, particularly in respect of the parasite load in different tissues and of the immunopathological changes relating to the progression of clinical forms [42, 43, [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . Whilst such data have been valuable in developing tools employed in the evaluation of both chemotherapies and vaccines against CVL, current treatment strategies have failed to achieve a consistent parasitological cure for the disease owing to the presence of latently infected cells [56, 57] . In this respect, a canine vaccine may represent the most practical and effective method by which to reduce the incidence of human VL, and it could also provide a basis for the development of a similar vaccine for humans [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] .",

Such an approach may not, however, accurately reflect efficacy in the dog [35, 63, 64] since a vaccine designed to protect dogs should clearly be developed using a canine model [30] . Since the saponin has previously used by Lasri et al. [29] in immunized dogs with Leishmania promastigotes vaccine, the inclusion of this adjuvant in FML formulation has shown strong immunogenicity in dogs [16, 17, 21, 23, 25] . Moreover, the remarkable results obtained following the antigens derived from parasite cultures (excreted/secreted antigens) [65] and vaccination of dogs with killed parasite vaccines were demonstrated in immunogenicity studies [29] [30] [31] 66] as well as in challenge with L. chagasi [28] showing that a successful vaccine against CVL is still possible. In additional, in field assays using FML antigen [16] and purified excreted-secreted antigens of L. infantum [24] demonstrated encouraging efficacies results. With the aim of further improving immunoprotection against VL, the development of a vaccine containing components present in the saliva of sand fly saliva has been suggested as a potential approach for the control of Leishmania infection [7, 37, 67, 68] .",

Several studies have reported the potential of L. chagasi antigens to trigger immunosuppression by blocking the in vitro lymphoproliferative response to Leishmania antigens as well as the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines by antigen-presenting cells [69, 70] . The use of purified L. donovani and L. infantum antigens has been also proposed to overcome this immunosuppressive effect of L. chagasi antigens [16, 20, 24] . According Giunchetti et al. [30] , most studies, including those clinical trials with vaccine candidates to CVL immunoprofilaxis have been conduced using either L. amazonensis, L. braziliensis or L. major antigens. Previous studies from our group have demonstrated that L. braziliensis antigen have a potent role in protecting L. chagasi infection in dogs (unpublished data). Therefore, a critical question for screening and development of anti-leishmanial vaccines in CVL is to define Leishmania antigens and adjuvant systems that elicit a favourable and sustained cytokine environment in vivo.",

The assessment of such information is an essential pre-requisite to the understanding of mechanisms relating to immunogenicity elicited by candidate vaccines.

The positive correlation between antisaliva immunoglobulin isotypes, especially IgG1 and IgG2, indicate a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response following vaccination with LBSapSal. Moreover, it has been suggested that a mixed anti-saliva response involving both Th1 and Th2 components in human subjects may help in establishing an anti-immune L. chagasi response [76] .

[26] , the cDNA from the salivary glands of the sand fly codes for a 71 kDa polypeptide that shows strong similarities to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) from Anopheles gambiae, Drosophila melanogaster, chicken and humans. However, the function of the sand fly saliva protein as a peptidase remains to be elucidated, and a 71 kDa anti-saliva immunoglobulin has not yet been detected in the sera of humans or dogs with VL. The 35 kDa saliva protein has been previously reported to be an apyrase related to the potent anti-platelet factors displayed by L. longipalpis and Phlebotomus papatasi [4, 15, 77, 78] . Additionally, the 45 kDa protein has been described in the saliva of L. longipalpis, P. papatasi, P. ariasi, P. argentipes and P. duboscqi as a yellow-related protein [4, 15, [77] [78] [79] , and is considered to be one of the most abundant proteins found in sand fly saliva [77] . The 35 and 45 kDa proteins have been proposed as vaccine candidates in the control of L. chagasi [37, 76] .",

The intense anti-Leishmania humoral immune response exhibited by the LBSapSal group was synchronous with increased numbers of circulating CD21 + B-cells following the first immunization, resulting in the differentiation of plasmacytes and higher levels of immunoglobulin secretion as described previously in dogs that had been immunized with crude Leishmania antigen [30] . Additionally, the positive correlation between CD4 + T-cells and CD21 + B-cells suggests a possible cooperation in the activation of the humoral immune response in the LBSapSal group. Higher counts of circulating CD21 + B-cells have been previously associated with a resistance profile in CVL [51] . In addition, immunization with LBSal and LBSapSal elicited an increase in the numbers of CD5 + T-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. However, this amplification was only related to T-cell subsets (CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells) in the LBSapSal group. Recently, a decrease in the circulating CD4 + T-cell count has been reported in dogs immunized with crude antigen plus Bacillus Calmete-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) as adjuvant [31] . In contrast, another study in which dogs were immunized with L. braziliensis plus saponin as adjuvant revealed an increase in the number of circulating CD4 + T-cells [30] . In CVL, the increase in counts of circulating CD4 + and CD8 + Tcells has been described as the major phenotypic feature of the asymptomatic disease in dogs bearing low parasite loads [51] . Additionally, increased counts of circulating CD8 + T-cells have been associated with a resistance marker pattern during vaccination against Leishmania [30, 31] . Thus, our findings support the hypothesis that immunization with LBSapSal elicits an increase in CD4 + and CD8 + T-lymphocytes that play a central role in protective immunity during Leishmania infection, as has been suggested previously for CVL [51, 86] .",

In this context, a close correlation between APC (evaluated as CD14 + monocytes) and lymphocyte activation status could be demonstrated following LBSapSal immunization. Interestingly, the early increase (at T1) of CD14 + monocytes in the LBSapSal group, followed by higher expression of CD80 (at T2) and MHC-I (at T3) in lymphocytes, were shown to be connected events. It is known that the up-regulation of MHC-I and -II are both related to the presence of interferon-\u2425 [88, 89] . In addition, the largest APC counts were associated with the highest expression of CD80 and MHC-I in lymphocytes, suggesting that this association could represent interaction between the innate and adaptive immune responses, reflecting an improvement in activation status during immunization with LBSapSal.",

Interestingly, a negative association was demonstrated between cell reactivity and CD4 + T-lymphocytes or CD14 + monocytes following in vitro stimulation in the Sal group. These data support the hypothesis that Sal treatment inhibits CD14 + monocytes in the promotion of CD4 + T-lymphocyte activation and the induction of cell proliferation. In fact, as previously described by Titus [90] , saliva from L. longipalpis suppresses the development of the CD4 + T-cell-specific sheep red blood cell (SRBC) proliferative response in mice immunized with SRBC antigen. In contrast, when in vitro cultures of PBMC derived from the LBSapSal group were stimulated with SLbA or SLcA, increased lymphoproliferation activity was accompanied by a higher frequency of CD8 + T-cells. These results support the hypothesis that CD8 + T-cells play a protective role in the mechanism of control of parasitism by Leishmania after LBSapSal treatment associated with the antigen-specific immune response to antigens from the etiological agent of CVL. Moreover, the lymphoproliferative response in the LBSapSal group was positively associated with APC and CD8 + T-cells following in vitro stimulation with SLcA or SLbA and SLcA, respectively. These findings indicate that the stimulation of antigen-specific T-cell subsets following LBSapSal immunization could contribute to improvements in the cellular immune response during L. chagasi infection.",

            "text": "The results presented in this study provide support for the continued development of vaccines based on the whole parasite approach. Such vaccines are attractive in terms of safety and stability of product compared with purified subunit preparations or DNA vaccines. Moreover, killed vaccines exhibit a greater diversity in antigenic repertoire with the potential to activate a stronger cellular response, mainly by T-lymphocytes, compared with those of purified subunit preparations or DNA vaccines. In addition, inclusion of sand fly saliva extract in vector-based vaccines appears to be advantageous by virtue of its potential to neutralize the anti-haemostatic and immunomodulatory effects of arthropod saliva that serve to enhance the ability of the pathogen to establish infection in the host. In the present study, sand fly saliva extract, in combination with killed Leishmania vaccine and saponin, elicited strong immunogenicity, with increased anti-saliva and anti-Leishmania immunoglobulin isotypes, together with higher counts of circulating CD8 + T-lymphocytes and SLcA-specific CD8 + T-lymphocytes, and high NO production. In conclusion, LBSapSal vaccine elicited a potential immune activation status that was potentially compatible with effective control of the etiological agent of CVL. Further investigations will focus on the efficacy of the LBSapSal vaccination in protection against experimental challenge with L. chagasi.",
