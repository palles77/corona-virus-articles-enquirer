These infections are easily transmitted by exposure to infected droplets expelled by coughing or sneezing that can be inhaled, or contaminated hands or surfaces. Symptoms include fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat and runny nose, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea. The new Influenza A (H1N1) appears to be as contagious as seasonal influenza, and spreads rapidly, particularly amongst young people. The severity of the disease ranges from very mild symptoms to serious illness and occasionally even death. The majority of people who contract the virus experience mild disease and recover without antiviral treatment or medical care. Additionally, more than 50% of serious hospitalized cases have underlying health conditions or impaired immune function. Antiviral drugs may reduce the symptoms and duration of illness and may also contribute to preventing severe disease and death. However, the effectiveness and cost of administered therapy remains an interesting topic for further investigation, as a recent Cochrane meta-analysis, although contested, reported a limited effect of Oseltamivir (Tamiflu s ), a classical antiviral drug (Jefferson et al., 2014) , mainly related to the time-limited and usual self-healing nature of the disease.",

The use of herbs as ailments in the island of Crete has been mentioned since the Bronze Age (Arnott, 1996) . Herbal medicine also has a long history in ancient Greece. Popular medical handbooks from the Byzantine era forward incorporated material rooted in ancient medicine and routinely claimed Hippocrates and Galen (among others) as sources (Clark, 2002) . In current times, the antioxidant activity of herbs in rural Crete has been investigated and it has been shown that herbal extracts decrease lipid peroxidation in cultured lung cells exposed to iron or ozone (Lionis et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "Previous ethnobotanical field studies have revealed the existence of an indigenous knowledge system in rural Crete and certain combinations of different aromatic plants in rural areas of Crete have been used for the prevention and cure of the common cold and influenza (Lionis et al., 1998) . The biological effects and bioactivity of essential oils and as well as their antibacterial properties have been reported in the literature (Cowan, 1999; Burt, 2004; Bakkali et al., 2008; Koroch et al., 2007) . Similarly, the antiviral potential of medicinal plants has been discussed as well (Jassim and Naji, 2003; Mukhtar et al., 2008) . It is also exciting that even though the term \"virus\" is a very recent term in modern medicine (Silverstein, 2009) , these rural societies, without any prior knowledge of the term and in the absence of any immunologic knowledge, were protecting the population using traditional and folkmedicine. As stated above, it was interesting to study to what extent this ethnopharmacological knowledge is evidence-based and effective in virus-induced diseases. To that effort we have also taken into account certain Cretan history and archeological elements, as well as their ethnopharmacological uses in the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East regions, suggesting a beneficial action of such a combination in upper respiratory viral infections (Dafni et al., 1984; Honda et al., 1996; Lev and Amar, 2002; Said et al., 2002; Hanlidou et al., 2004; Lardos, 2006; Hudaib et al., 2008) .",

Rchb. f. synonym of Thymbra capitata (L.) Cav.), dictamnus or Cretan dittany (Origanum dictamnus L.) and sage (Salvia fruticosa Mill., Salvia pomifera L.) extracts through steam distillation. Analysis of essential oils was performed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy, in a GC-MS, Shimadzu, QP 5050A apparatus. GC was equipped with MDN-5 column (length 30 m, film thickness 0.25 mm, diameter 0.25 mm, max. useable temperature 325 1C) and a Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer as detector. MDN-5 column temperature was initially 50 1C for 5 min. It was then gradually increased to 150 1C at 5 1C/min and kept for 10 min, and finally increased to 280 1C at 5 1C/min and held for 20 min. The carrier gas was helium, the flow rate 0.9 mL/min. 2 \u03bcL was used as an injection volume. The sample was measured in a split mode procedure with a split ratio 1:35. Injector and detector were maintained at 230 and 250 1C, respectively. For GS-MS detection an electron ionization system was used with ionization energy at 70 eV. The chemical and percentage composition of specific constituents in each essential oil (Adams, 2007) is shown in Supplemental Tables 1-3. Essential oils (at a dilution of 15 ml/L) in extra virgin olive oil (used as a vehicle) were formulated as 0.5 ml soft-gel capsules, for a daily dose of two capsules. This dose has been based on anthropological reports of fieldwork work studies carried on Crete (Lionis et al. 2004 ) and corresponds to two cups of infusion of the aforementioned aromatic plants. Placebo capsules contained only extra-virgin oil, equally formulated as 0.5 ml soft-gel capsules. GC-MS chemical and percentage composition of the formulated mixture (Adams, 2007) are shown in Supplemental Table 4 .",

These criteria consist of sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, sore throat, cough, headache, malaise and chilliness. A patient was considered as eligible for participation when the Jackson score was greater or equal than two (with at least one of the first four 'cold-specific' symptoms present). Patients on a daily dosage of acetylsalicylic acid greater than 100 mg were excluded from the study. Further criteria for exclusion were the presence of malignancy, immunosuppression and pregnancy. Harakas Health Center serves a population of 12,284, in rural Crete. Of the 11 General Practitioners (GPs) practicing at the Centre, 10 agreed to participate.

Severity of symptoms over the study period was compared between intervention and control groups, using the 19-item WURSS-21 scores, with both univariate techniques and multiple linear regression models, adjusting for age, sex, initial CRP level, body mass index (BMI) and the presence of chronic diseases. Severity was assessed in three ways: (a) firstly, the average total WURSS-21 score over the time period was compared between groups (i.e. the sum of daily WURSS-21 scores). (b) Differences between the 2 groups were assessed by calculating the area under the time-severity curve (the y-axis being the WURSS-21 score). The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using a trapezoidal approximation. (c) Finally, the average maximum WURSS score (for each subject) was compared between groups. The percentage of missing values for the daily WURSS-21 scores ranged from 2.8% (n\u00bc3 out of 108 at baseline) to 6.5% (n\u00bc7 out of 108 on day three). Confidence intervals for median daily scores were calculated using a binomial method (the centile command in Stata 12). Multiple linear regression models were applied, with dependent variable the natural logarithm of the AUC [ln(AUC)] and independent variables the treatment (intervention/placebo), age (in years), BMI (kg/m 2 ), gender (male/female), presence of chronic illnesses (yes/no) and CRP-level upon presentation (Z0.8 mg/dL vs r0.8 mg/dL). Discrete-time survival analysis was used to assess possible differences in time to symptom cessation (i.e. symptom duration) between groups. Symptoms were considered absent on the first day in which the WURSS score dropped to zero. An intention-totreat approach was used. A complementary log-log model (a discrete time proportional hazards model) was also applied to our data. The model was estimated by maximum likelihood adjusting for age and sex (Stata command cloglog). The proportions of initially CRP-positive subjects who were CRP-negative at the end of the study were compared between groups.

Comparison between patients willing to participate and those who were not did not produce significant results in terms of gender distribution. Those who were willing to participate were significantly older than those who were not (mean age 50 versus 41 years; 95% CI for the difference from 4.12 to 14.72 years). One hundred and eight (108) patients were enrolled in this study; however, three (3) patients (2.8%) did not complete it (two in the placebo group and one in the intervention group). One patient developed pneumonia, one patient reported being unable to swallow the pills and one patient was lost to follow-up after the initial examination (Fig. 1) .",

We are not certain to what extent non-infectious diseases have been included in the study sample. This may explain the high number of patients without a virus-infection (resulting in a sample size far lower than that required to detect a medium-large effect size-see Methods). The possible inclusion of non-infectious diseases could seriously have affected the design of the study that assumed a high proportion of patients with virus infection. (2) The primary endpoint of this trial was also based on self-reported symptoms and it is known that subjective self-assessment might also be another potential source of bias. Furthermore, the self-healing nature of the disease and the small duration of the symptoms presents additional difficulties in the exploitation of the data.",

In a recent review it was highlighted that the use of certain herbal extracts rich in polyphenols could play an important role in controlling virus outbreaks and alleviating their symptoms (Hudson, 2009) . Actually, we are in the process of further delineating the direct anti-viral action of our preparation, as well as of some of its specific constituents, detected after an NMR analysis, although we strongly believe that the beneficial effect might be attributed to a combined effect of more than one constituent, as we have previously reported in the case of wine extracts Kampa et al., 2000) .",

In addition, the proportion of patients completing the study was very high. However, there are certain limitations that need to be considered in the interpretation of results. Our sample is limited in size ($ 100 participants) and becomes even smaller when focussing on patients with a documented viral infection. Even in the sub-sample of virus positive patients, our sample was very heterogeneous as several types of viruses were identified. However, the effect of our extract might be underestimated, since a sample of 48 subjects with a virus-documented infection does not provide enough statistical power, to respond to the question of the potency of our preparation in a large spectrum of common cold and influenza viruses. This can only be addressed through laboratory estimation of the potency of our preparation on virallyinfected cells (which is under investigation) and through a larger analysis, permitting the collection of a significantly higher number of virus-infected patients.",

However, our main intention was to introduce and promote research based on indigenous knowledge of the European regional flora, especially from the island of Crete, considered as a herbarium of the Mediterranean flora. We do not, of course, suggest to the health practitioners that they replace existing guidelines about the use of anti-viral treatment in influenza virus, although the use of specific anti-viral agents has been recently criticized, nor we suggest the combined use of anti-viral drugs and herbal extracts, which may lead to unwanted drug-herb interactions (Yang et al., 2012) . The study findings arrive on a time where much criticism has been published on the effectiveness of the neuraminidase inhibitors (Jefferson et al., 2014) . Very few adverse effects were reported in our study group. Indeed, our current laboratory data suggest that our preparation is effective in a broad spectrum of viruses, at doses similar or higher to those reported here.",
