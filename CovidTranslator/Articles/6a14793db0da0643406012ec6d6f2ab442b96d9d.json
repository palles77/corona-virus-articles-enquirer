Furthermore, it was recently demonstrated that a sustained loss of mDCs and pDCs occurs in SIV-infected macaques. Since loss of functional DC populations might impair innate immune responses to opportunistic microorganisms and neoplastic cells, we explored whether inoculation of naive and SIV-or SHIV-infected pigtailed macaques with the hematopoietic cytokine FLT3-ligand (FLT3-L) would expand the number of mDCs and pDCs in vivo. After the macaques received supraphysiologic doses of FLT3-L, mDCs, pDCs, and monocytes increased up to 45-fold in blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow (BM), with DC expansion in the BM preceding mobilization in blood and lymphoid tissues. FLT3-L also increased serum levels of IL-12, at least transiently, and elicited higher surface expression of HLA-DR and the activation markers CD25 and CD69 on NK and T cells. During and after treatment of infected animals, APCs increased in number and were activated; however, CD4 \u00fe T cell numbers, virion RNA, and anti-SIV=SHIV antibody titers remained relatively stable, suggesting that FLT3-L might be a safe modality to expand DC populations and provide therapeutic benefit during chronic lentivirus infections.",

            "text": "D endritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that link the innate and adaptive immune systems by recognizing pathogens and initiating humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Two major types of DCs circulate in human blood: CD11c \u00fe myeloid (mDCs) and CD123 \u00fe plasmacytoid (pDCs). In general, mDCs are more competent than pDCs at presenting antigen (Ag) to naive T cells 1,2 ; however, Hoeffel et al. 3 recently showed in vitro that human pDCs cross-present HIV-1 epitopes, (as lipopeptides), or after uptake of HIV-1 Ags in apoptotic cells, as efficiently as mDCs. Following recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns contained in bacteria and viruses by toll-like receptors (TLRs), both DC subsets secrete cytokines and upregulate the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86. 4, 5 On virus activation pDCs secrete more interferon (IFN)-a per cell than other cell types and are called IFN-producing cells. 6 Furthermore, mDCs and pDCs act synergistically to mediate immune responses against HIV-1 and tumor cells and to enhance the development and activation of regulatory T (Treg) and NK cells. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Studies on mDCs and pDCs typically focus on cells in blood, but both DC subsets in various stages of development are common in murine, macaque (Macaca), and human bone marrow (BM), their site of origin. [12] [13] [14] [15] DCs also accumulate in respiratory mucosae following allergic stimuli and in cerebrospinal fluid during bacterial meningitis, induce antiviral responses in the vaginal mucosa, and can be isolated from human tonsils, thymus, lungs, liver, kidney, colon, and peripheral lymph nodes (LNs). [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] Reduction in the numbers and functions of circulating mDCs and pDCs can occur during viral infections, such as with hepatitis B and C viruses, human T cell leukemia virus, SARS coronavirus, and HIV-1. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] We and others showed that DC numbers are reduced in blood and secondary lymphoid organs of rhesus (Macaca mulatta) and pigtailed macaques (M. nemestrina) acutely and chronically infected with SIV. [32] [33] [34] Characterization of pDCs in BM of normal pigtailed macaques also revealed that while these cells are less mature phenotypically than their blood counterparts, they were responsive to microbial stimuli. 15, 35 Because of their importance in initiating immune responses to pathogens and Ags in vaccine formulations, developing novel strategies to mobilize, by activation and=or maturation, DC populations in vivo is a valid goal. CD34 \u00fe myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells have high levels of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) receptors on their cell surfaces. 36, 37 The ligand for FLT3 (FLT3-L) is a cytokine expressed in most tissues, but it is at the highest levels on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A soluble isoform of FLT3-L is also present in human blood at concentrations typically between 50 and 100 pg=ml. 38 FLT3-L is elevated in serum from patients undergoing chemotherapy, and abnormally high levels are associated with hematologic disorders and autoimmune diseases. [39] [40] [41] Initially, murine studies showed that 9 days of subcutaneous inoculation of FLT3-L increased functional splenic DCs up to 17-fold. 37, 42, 43 After human stem cell transplantation, administration of FLT3-L to patients elicited increases in DC numbers and enhanced recovery of DC and NK cell subsets. [44] [45] [46] FLT3-L-induced DC expansion, with subsequent emigration from BM, was first performed in macaques using a 10-day regimen that efficiently led to activated and increased numbers of DCs in blood, 47 but Teleshova et al. 48 showed that a 7-day regimen was equally effective. Similar experiments using a chimeric FLT3 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor agonist, progenipoietin-1 (ProGP), were performed in naive and SIVmac32Hinfected macaques. 49 ProGP induced as much as a 50-fold expansion of blood DCs, but this increase was insufficient to augment responses to HIV Ags elicited by DNA vaccination and to protect macaques against challenge with SHIV-89.6P. 50 In contrast, Kwissa et al. 51 inoculated macaques with FLT3-L for 14 days followed by immunization, either alone or with CpG-B DNA, a TLR9 ligand, with plasmid DNA (recombinant vaccinia virus Ankara, rMVA) expressing both SIV and HIV proteins. Their results demonstrated that by day 14 of FLT3-L treatment, activation enhanced expression of CD86 on mDCs and monocytes and, after boosting twice with rMVA, the number of CD8 \u00fe T cells expressing IFN-g increased. This regimen did not prevent infection in all immunized groups after rectal SIVmac251 challenge, but viremia was reduced at 2 and 24 weeks in the best responders, those that received CpG-B DNA and FLT3-L.",

All SIVmac239-and SHIV-89.6P-infected animals had viral antibody titers that ranged from 400 to 409,600 (reciprocal serum dilutions); no significant changes in titers from those on day 0 were observed during or after FLT3-L treatment, which is consistent with minimal changes in viral loads. Loss of CD4 \u00fe T cells is a hallmark of progressive lentiviral disease; before FLT3-L treatment the mean numbers of CD4 \u00fe T cells in pigtailed macaques chronically infected with SIVmac239 mutants (702 =ml) or SHIV-89.6P (462 cells=ml) were lower than in naive controls (1499 cells=ml Changes in circulating numbers of mDCs and pDCs associated with FLT3-L CD34 \u00fe myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells express the FLT3 receptor; therefore, FLT3-L exogenously administered should promote proliferation and differentiation of DC subsets (Fig. 3A) . Before injection of FLT3-L, the mean numbers of blood mDCs were lower in SIVmac239-and SHIV-89.6Pinfected (50,200 and 67,800 mDCs=ml, respectively) macaques compared to those in naive animals (116,000 mDCs=ml) (Fig. 3B) . However, no significant difference (Mann-Whitney U test) between naive and infected animals was noted, probably due to the broad distribution of mDCs and small sample sizes of each group. In general, the numbers of mDCs began to increase by day 4 or 5 and peaked around day 8; relative increases for individual animals ranged from 1.5-to 12-fold, with no differences between naive and infected animals (Fig. 3B ). The relative increases in mDCs in SIVmac239infected were higher than those in either SHIV-89.6P-infected or naive animals, resulting in slightly greater numbers of circulating mDCs when the numbers peaked.",

[58] [59] [60] [61] However, during HIV infection, secretion of IL-12 and IFN-a is impaired. Exogenous FLT3-L resulted in transient increases in absolute numbers of circulating monocytes, mDCs, and pDCs, and also was associated with higher cell surface expression of HLA-DR; therefore, we determined whether these changes coincided with increased concentrations of DC-and monocyte-specific cytokines. On day 0, IL-12 was detected in serum from all animals, but the mean values were more than 2-fold higher in naive compared to both SIVmac239-and SHIV-89.6P-infected animals (Fig. 5A) . Moderate increases in serum IL-12 occurred between days 8 to 12, with the largest increase (>4-fold) in macaque 97P045. Before the first FLT3-L injection, only two macaques had detectable serum IFN-a ( Table 2 ). In macaques 97P009, CT19, AP1P, and AV1C, IFN-a was measured as early as day 4, but generally after day 10. On day 0, all serum samples were negative for TNF-a, but in one naive and three of four SHIV-89.6P-infected macaques, TNF-a was detected on one or more occasions during the 21 days of FLT3-L treatment and observation. Concentrations of TNF-a increased to greater than 27 pg=ml in 97P045 and 97P009, which was unusual because serum TNF-a typically is undetectable in naive pigtailed macaques and in those infected with various SIV=SHIV strains. 62 Both mDCs and pDCs activate T and NK cells, either by direct interactions or indirectly through cytokines, such as IFN-a, TNF-a, and IL-12, suggesting that the larger numbers of circulating DCs and higher serum cytokine concentrations might be associated with generalized activation and proliferation of both T and NK cells. 9,58-60 However, no consistent changes were observed in the numbers of CD3 \u00fe CD4 \u00fe T cells and any increases were probably influenced by fluctuations in the absolute numbers of total lymphocytes that occurred in response to FLT3-L (Fig. 2B) . Also, there were no significant changes in the total numbers of CD3 \u00fe CD8 \u00fe T cells and NK cells (defined as CD16 \u00fe CD8 \u00fe CD3 \u00c0 or NKG2A \u00fe CD8 \u00fe CD3 \u00c0 ) in either the infected or naive animals (data not shown). As a measure of T cell activation, we determined the frequencies of cells expressing the IL-2 receptor (CD25), which can be used either as a marker of T cell activation and proliferation or to identify Tregs. [63] [64] [65] [66] In most animals, increases in the frequencies of CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells expressing CD25 were observed: mean days of maximum expression on CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells were 11.4 and 7.9 days, respectively (Fig. 5B) . The frequencies of NK and CD8 \u00fe T cells expressing another activation marker, CD69, also significantly increased; the mean times of maximum CD69 expression on CD8 \u00fe T cells were 10.4 days and on NK cells were 11.2 days.

The absolute numbers of mDCs (B) and pDCs (C) at initiation, during, and after FLT3-L administration were calculated per milliliter of blood using percentages obtained by flow cytometry, multiplied by the absolute numbers of lymphocytes and monocytes combined, as determined using CBC and differentials. Note differences in the scales on the y-axes. DC numbers from day 0 were compared to peak numbers for animals in all groups; Mann-Whitney U test. The frequencies of CD4 \u00fe CD3 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe CD3 \u00fe T cells expressing CD25 and that of NK cells (CD16 \u00fe CD8 \u00fe CD3 \u00c0 or NKG2A \u00fe CD8 \u00fe CD3 \u00c0 cells) and CD8 \u00fe CD3 \u00fe T cells expressing CD69 were determined throughout the study.

In the three macaques for which PLN biopsies were performed on day 4, no changes in either mDCs or pDCs were observed; however, mDCs and pDCs in most animals increased during days 8 to 12 and then stabilized or decreased. The largest increase in mDCs was 35-fold for macaque 98P012 and in pDCs, 11-fold for macaque CT19. mDCs and pDCs were enumerated in mesenteric LNs (MLNs), spleens, lungs, and jejunums collected at necropsy (Table 3) . While the numbers of DCs in each of these tissues varied considerably, mDCs typically were more prevalent than pDCs, consistent with observations in blood, BM, and PLNs. Lung and spleen tissues were particularly enriched for mDCs, while jejunums appeared to contain the lowest numbers (Fig. 7) . Since MC fractions from jejunums were eluted over glass wool columns to remove epithelial cells and mDCs exhibit some adherent properties (R.K. Reeves, unpublished) , the prevalence of these cells in jejunums might be underestimated. Furthermore, although DCs were not enumerated in MLNs, spleens, lungs, and jejunums of FLT3-L-naive animals, we previously reported pDC frequencies in MLNs and spleens of SIV=SHIV-infected and uninfected macaques that did not receive FLT3-L. 33 The median numbers of pDCs=10 6 MLN-MCs were 300, 600, and 400 in SIVmac239-and SHIV-89.6P-infected and uninfected animals, respectively. The numbers of pDCs in MLNs of FLT3-L-treated macaques in the current study were consistently greater (up to 15-fold, Table 3 ), regardless of viral status. Interestingly, the numbers of pDCs in spleens of FLT3-L-treated virus-naive and SHIV-89.6P-infected macaques were comparable or only slightly greater than the numbers of pDCs in the corresponding FLT3-L-naive macaques previously studied. 33 All FLT3-L-treated SIVmac239-infected animals had greater numbers than the median of approximately 600 pDCs in untreated, similarly infected macaques; e.g., 99PO32 had almost 5000 pDCs=10 6 splenic MCs. These results suggested that expansion of DCs in tissues other than blood, BM, and PLNs also occurs in response to high levels of FLT3-L; however, a caveat to the tissue data (Table 3) is that MLNs, spleens, lungs, and jejunums from FLT3-L-treated macaques were taken on day 12 or later, which could be after the time of peak DC expansion.",

In this study we inoculated uninfected and SIV-or SHIVinfected pigtailed macaques with the hematopoietic cytokine FLT3-L and evaluated its effects on (1) hematologic parameters, (2) SIVmac239 and SHIV-89.6P viremia and disease progression, and (3) immune cell activation. Previous studies in which humans and nonhuman primates were inoculated with FLT3-L did not quantify serum concentrations and most did not evaluate animals infected with a lentivirus. Normal serum concentrations of FLT3-L in pigtailed macaques were similar to levels found in two studies of healthy humans, \u00c0=\u00c0 \u00c0 =\u00c0 \u00c0 =\u00c0 \u00c0 =\u00c0 11.0=5.5 a IFN-a=TNF-a (pg=ml) were measured in aliquots of serum obtained on days when blood was drawn from each animal (see Table 1 ).

Our findings, however, indicate that peak levels of FLT3-L in macaques were similar to those observed in humans and macaques with chemotherapeutic-or radiation-induced aplasia where hematopoiesis is upregulated due to pancytopenia. 41, 44, 67 Higher serum concentrations of FLT3-L coincided with higher numbers of monocytes, but alterations in the numbers of circulating lymphocytes were inconsistent. This finding agrees with that of Papayannopoulou et al. 68 who showed that in a cohort of FLT3-L-treated naive pigtailed macaques, myeloid progenitors were mobilized at a greater frequency than lymphoid progenitor cells. Coates et al., 47 however, reported a significantly higher frequency of lymphocytes in rhesus macaques given FLT3-L and, although the absolute numbers of circulating lymphocytes were not shown, this disparity might reflect minor differences in the responsiveness to FLT3-L of pigtailed compared to rhesus macaques. We observed a transient decrease in platelets, a result not unexpected since it was reported that when added to cell cultures, FLT3-L inhibited megakaryocyte differentiation from CD34 \u00fe progenitors. 69, 70 Furthermore, increased serum levels of FLT3-L in cynomolgus macaques that developed radiation-induced aplasia were associated with a decline in platelets, and FLT3-L treatment counteracted the effects of thrombopoietin-induced restoration of platelet counts in myelosuppressed rhesus macaques. 67, 71 Although the decrease in platelets that we observed was minimal and resolved within about 4 days after the last FLT3-L injection, it is possible that therapeutic administration of FLT3-L during advanced lentiviral disease, when thrombocytopenia is common, might elicit complications.",

Since the magnitude of expansion of mDCs in naive and infected macaques did not differ, the generally higher fold increases in other studies cannot be attributed to infection status, but might reflect either differences in rhesus versus pigtailed macaques or natural variation among outbred animals. Also, it is possible that our evaluations were not done at optimum times since Teleshova et al. 48 found the peak of DC expansion to be 10 days after initiation of the 7-day regimen, a day on which we did not examine most animals. While the magnitude and kinetics of monocyte and mDC expansion did not differ significantly between naive and infected macaques, the peak numbers of pDCs generally occurred later in infected (day 12) than in naive animals (day 8). The initial numbers of pDCs in blood from SIVmac239-and SHIV-89.6P-infected, compared to naive, animals were lower, suggesting that immediate pDC precursors might also be lower, which might delay increases of pDCs in blood. Although viral replication was generally not detected in these animals, it is possible newly activated, more mature pDCs, which are susceptible to lentivirus (Table 3) . Representative examples of FACScan plots are shown only for jejunum and lung, which clearly demonstrate the larger number of mDCs in lung than in jejunum.",

These differences might be related to the aviremic status of most of the macaques, a condition that might be associated with minimal immune system activation, or simply to differences in virus-host interactions in humans versus macaques. Also it is possible that the limited number of animals in our cohorts did not exhibit the full range of expression of these cell surface proteins. FLT3-L treatment of macaques, however, was associated with increases in HLA-DR expression on both mDCs and pDCs; CD80, CD86, and CD40 appeared to be upregulated in some animals. Using the same FLT3-L regimen, Teleshova et al. 48 reported significant upregulation of CD80 and CD86 on mDCs and pDCs in rhesus macaques. In FLT3-L-treated melanoma and renal cancer patients, CD86 and HLA-DR, but not CD80, were upregulated on DCs. 75 DCs mobilized in the lungs of FLT3-L-treated mice expressed higher levels of CD40, CD86, and HLA-DR than DCs in placebo-treated controls. 76 Combined with our data, these observations strongly indicate that, in general, blood DCs not only increase in number during FLT3-L treatment, but also can be activated.",

Although evaluation of a more definitive Treg marker, such as FoxP3, would confirm the latter idea, mDCs and pDCs are known to induce Treg development by mechanisms that can involve IFN-a, TNF-a, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. 11, [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] Specifically, during acute SIV infection of cynomolgus macaques, Malleret et al. 85 found that pDCs and type I IFNs played important roles in eliciting an immunosuppressive state. Furthermore, IFN-a=b produced by pDCs follow-ing HIV infection can modulate proliferation and depletion of effector CD4 \u00fe T cells, also contributing to immunosuppression. Since Tregs can influence HIV=SIV disease progression by limiting virus-specific immune responses, 65, 66, [85] [86] [87] [88] an increase in this population potentially might be detrimental for FLT3-L-based immunotherapies for HIV. However, Tregs, in general, are only a minor proportion of any CD4 \u00fe CD25 \u00fe population. 89 Our data also indicated that FLT3-L administration upregulated activation states, but not numbers, of NK cells, which contrasts with some murine studies in which FLT3-L treatment led to significant increases in NK cells concurrent with DC mobilization. 90 The increased CD69 expression on NK cells that we observed likely is linked to higher serum IL-12, which activates NK cells. 91 Whether activation enhanced the lytic activity of NK cells, which would be beneficial in lentivirus infections where NK cell numbers and functions can be impaired, [92] [93] [94] was not evaluated.",

Also, Koopman et al. 49 observed no changes in viremia in a cohort of SIV-infected macaques treated with the related FLT3 agonist, ProGP-1. However, in our study, vRNA in plasma from 98P016 increased almost 6-fold after 15 days, suggesting that FLT3-L potentially might augment viral replication in animals with measurable viremia.

Other studies utilized rhesus or cynomolgus macaques whereas we used pigtailed macaques-three distinct species-that are known to differ physiologically and in their pathological responses to some SIV strains. FLT3-L is expressed ubiquitously in tissues, while the FLT3 receptor is limited to CD34 \u00fe progenitor cells, including those for DCs 36, 37 ; therefore, initial DC activation should occur where CD34 \u00fe cells are concentrated. As in humans, we verified this site to be macaque BM and both mDC and pDC activation and mobilization in BM appeared to precede that in blood. 35 In support of this finding, there was a significant correlation between serum levels of FLT3-L and DC numbers in BM (mDCs, R \u00bc 0.5630, p \u00bc 0.006; pDCs, R \u00bc 0.5991, p \u00bc 0.003), but not in blood. Although BM damage occurs in HIV, SIV, and SHIV infections, 97-99 it was not obvious that DC activation in BM was impaired in infected animals. Our detection of significant increases in both mDCs and pDCs in the PLNs of all animals is similar to that in previous surveys of macaques. It is interesting that, as in blood, DC numbers did not increase in PLNs on day 4, which is highly suggestive that DCs originated in the BM and then migrated through the blood to LNs. Because we detected low frequencies of CD34 \u00fe cells in both blood and LNs (not shown), we cannot exclude the possibility that some newly generated DCs were derived from localized progenitor cells and did not originate directly from BM precursors. Consistent with this possibility, Waskow et al. 73 recently showed that DC precursors transit from BM to spleen and LNs where their division is controlled by FLT3-L.",

These future studies should be a comprehensive evaluation of the positive and negative effects of FLT3-L administration to SIV-infected macaques that are nonprogressors with low viral loads and to those exhibiting signs of disease progression.",
