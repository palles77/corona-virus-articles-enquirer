Lai et al., 3 have reported that in adult patients, fever was the most common symptom (92.8%; n = 258), followed by cough (69.8%; n = 194), dyspnea (34.5%; n = 96), myalgia (27.7%; n = 77), headache (7.2%; n = 20), and diarrhea (6.1%; n = 17). 3 Our observations are based on patients referred to a single-center gastroenterology clinic, and only two cases were documented. Thus, it is important to address promptly whether the incidence of unusual GI symptoms occurs before the incidence of respiratory disorders in patients confirmed to have COVID-19 pneumonia. The answer to this question may offer better, more effective therapeutic management, before lung involvement, of the COVID-19 virus.",

For the majority of patients, results of laboratory tests for blood analysis, biochemical analyses, endoscopy, and colonoscopy were acceptable. However, some abnormal findings were noted in the upper abdominal CT scan sections. Due to the current outbreak of COVID-19 in Qom province, we immediately suspected COVID-19. For further evaluation, a chest CT scan and laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 were performed using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Surprisingly, all patients with unusual GI symptoms, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and various forms of lung involvement were seen in the chest CT scans. However, no mortality occurred and all symptoms subsided after 2-3 weeks for all patients, without the administration of any medication. Respiratory tract symptoms were not observed in any patient in this study.",
