There is no substitute for a thorough physical examination in trying to determine which body systems of a sick animal are affected; this is true especially with diseases of the gastrointestinal system. A complete physical examination should include palpation for body condition, assessment of abdominal shape and rumen motility, observation of the consistency of the stool, and evaluation for the presence of bloat. Rectal palpation cannot be performed in sheep and goats, however, so localization of a disease process to a particular segment of the gastrointestinal system can be difficult. Therefore ancillary diagnostic procedures may be needed to characterize gastrointestinal diseases properly.",

A CBC rarely identifies a specific disease but can be helpful in evaluating the severity of dehydration, anemia, and hypoproteinemia. The clinician must take care to interpret the packed cell volume (PCV) and total protein in light of the hydration status of the animal as noted on physical examination. An anemic or dehydrated hypoproteinemic animal may have normal PCV and total protein values. Both the CBC and SBE can be helpful in determining the presence and severity of an inflammatory disease process. Changes in the total and differential white blood cell counts indicate acute or chronic inflammation; increases in globulins or fibrinogen suggest a chronic inflammatory disease. Low protein levels, especially of albumin, can point to chronic blood loss from intestinal parasitism or infiltrative bowel disease. Liver disease should be suspected if liver enzyme or bilirubin levels are elevated. Of note, however, liver enzyme concentrations can be normal in chronic liver disease. Also, albumin levels rarely drop in ruminants with liver disease as they do in other species. 1 Changes in electrolytes can occur with gastrointestinal disease, especially if affected animals are anorexic. Electrolyte measurements also are helpful in formulating a treatment plan. Hypochloremia and metabolic alkalosis occasionally occur in abomasal disease. A mild hypocalcemia may be encountered in some small ruminants with gastrointestinal atony. Many animals with gastrointestinal disease are dehydrated, azotemic, and possibly hypoproteinemic; therefore it may be helpful to rule out urinary tract disorders in these cases.",

An appropriately sized orogastric tube can be passed through the oral or nasal cavity for fluid collection ( Figure 5-1 ). For this procedure, proper restraint of the animal, using a mouth speculum to prevent chewing of the tube if it is passed orally, is essential. If the tube is chewed, its roughened surface may damage the esophagus, and parts of a broken tube can be swallowed. Rumen fluid also can be collected using percutaneous rumenocentesis. 1, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] For this percutaneous technique, a 16-gauge needle is inserted in the rumen through the abdominal wall caudal to the xyphoid and to the left of midline. The clinician then aspirates fluid with a syringe. Local anesthesia and sedation of the animal may be necessary. This technique avoids the saliva contamination that can occur during collection with an orogastric tube, and it appears to be less stressful. Rumenocentesis carries a slight risk of peritonitis, but this risk can be minimized with immobilization of the animal through proper restraint.",

The clinician should take care to avoid the prepuce in males and mammary veins in females. The second technique is useful if peritonitis is suspected. Because localized peritonitis is more common than generalized peritonitis, four sites are tapped. 12 The two cranial sites are slightly caudal to the xyphoid and medial to the milk veins on both sides. The two caudal sites are slightly cranial to the mammary gland and to the left and right of midline.

Fluid should be collected in a small ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) tube for analysis and a sterile tube for culture. Abdominal fluid can be difficult to obtain because of the small amounts normally present in both sheep and goats. It is important to minimize the ratio of EDTA to fluid in the sample, because EDTA can falsely elevate protein levels. Using EDTA tubes made for small animals or shaking excess EDTA out of large tubes resolves this problem. Normal culture results are similar to those for cattle (clear, colorless to slightly yellow, 1 to 5 g/dL protein, less than 10,000 cells) 12 (see Appendix  Table H ).

The abdominal cavity can be inflated with CO 2 delivered by a needle or teat cannula or after placement of a laparoscopic cannula. A time-saving method is to make a \"bite\" through the skin and into the external rectus sheath with a suture, which can be pulled tight in order to tense the body wall. A stab incision can then be made in the skin and external rectus sheath before introduction of a guarded trocar into the abdominal cavity while tension is applied to the abdominal wall using the previously placed suture. Next, the laparoscope is placed through the trocar and the abdomen inflated under visualization through the scope. The cannula is then placed in the inguinal area as described for laparoscopic insemination (Chapter 8). This technique allows a more efficient use of time and minimizes the likelihood that the omentum will be \"ballooned.\"",

The technique of exploratory laparotomy used in cattle can be adopted for sheep and goats with the understanding that these animals are more likely to lie down during surgery; therefore standing surgery should be attempted only rarely. 22 For this procedure, small ruminants should be heavily sedated or placed under general anesthesia. Animals that show signs of postoperative pain, anorexia, and depression should be treated accordingly with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) (e.g., flunixin meglumine, 1.1 to 2.2 mg/kg intravenously [IV] ). 12 The decision to use perioperative and postoperative antimicrobial agents should be based on the conditions under which the surgery is performed and the diagnosis made at surgery. Antimicrobial agents are not necessary for elective exploratory surgery performed aseptically, in a hospital setting, and without complications. However, they are indicated in field conditions, if infection is already present, and if the intestinal tract is opened. A combination of ceftiofur (1.1 to 2.2 mg/kg intramuscularly [IM] or subcutaneously [SC] twice a day) and procaine penicillin G (22,000 international units [IU]/kg IM twice daily) can be administered until culture results indicate an absence of microbes (see also Appendix 1).",

            "text": "Bloat is less common in small ruminants than in cattle, with goats being affected less commonly than sheep. Bloat is the accumulation of either free gas or froth in the rumen, which causes rumen distention. The causes of bloat can be divided into three categories 1,2 : Frothy bloat-caused by diets that promote the formation of stable froth Free gas bloat-caused by diets that promote excessive free gas production Free gas bloat-caused by failure to eructate Pathogenesis Frothy bloat usually is associated with the ingestion of legume forages or hay (particularly alfalfa) and with grazing on lush cereal grain pastures, but it also may occur with high-grain diets. 3 In the case of frothy bloat from a fine-ground diet (usually corn), mucoprotein released from rumen protozoa stabilizes the foam at a low pH. In legume-associated frothy bloat, plant chloroplasts released into the rumen trap gas bubbles. Regardless of the form of frothy bloat, the small bubbles fill much of the rumen, preventing clearance of the rumen's cardia and resulting in a cessation of eructation. Free gas bloat also occurs with grain diets, especially if the animals are not adapted to the diet. Failure to eructate has a variety of causes. Physical obstructions of the esophagus such as with choke or swollen mediastinal lymph nodes can cause free gas bloat. Any disease of the rumen wall may result in impairment of contractions and eructation. Hypocalcemia, endotoxemia, pain, peritonitis, and some pharmaceutical agents (especially xylazine) all produce conditions that interfere with rumen function and eructation. 1, 2, 4, 5 ",

If the animal is not in immediate danger of dying, an orogastric tube can be passed. Most cases of free gas bloat are relieved with passage of the tube. A thorough history and complete physical examination are then indicated to find the cause of the bloat. If the bloat is not relieved with passage of an orogastric tube, the tube should be removed and examined for evidence of froth. Frothy bloat can be treated with poloxalene (44 mg/kg) or dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS) (28 mL [1 oz]) delivered by orogastric tube. The froth encountered in frothy bloat, caused by the ingestion of finely ground grain, has a pH of less than 5.5. If frothy bloat develops while animals are being fed concentrates, mineral oil (100 mL) may work better. Peanut oil (20 to 50 mg/kg), vegetable oil (100 to 200 mL), and hand soap (10 mL) also have been recommended in emergency situations. 3 If the animal is in severe respiratory distress, the clinician should insert a trocar or large needle into the rumen at the paralumbar fossa. If gas does not escape, or froth is seen coming out of the trocar, an emergency rumenotomy is indicated (see later under \"Rumenotomy\"). 3 With occurrence of bloat in multiple animals of a pastured group, the entire group should be removed from the pasture and reintroduced slowly after gradual acclimation. If only one or two cases of bloat are encountered, the healthy animals can remain on the offending pasture, but grazing should be limited, to ensure gradual acclimation.",

When grazing or consuming legumes as green chop animals should be introduced to the feed or pasture slowly, preferably over 2 to 3 weeks. Animals should be closely monitored after a frost and during the rapid growth phase of plants, because legumes, particularly alfalfa, may be more likely to cause bloat at this time. Certain varieties of legumes that are designed for intensive grazing systems (e.g., Alfagraze) should be planted and managed in a manner that decreases the incidence of bloat (e.g., limited or creep grazing). Feeding dry, stemmy hay for 1 to 2 hours before allowing access to the legume pasture also may help minimize occurrence of bloat. Grass-legume pastures in which legumes are limited to less than 50% of the forage are safer but can still pose a problem with animals that are selective grazers. Grazing legumes with high leaf tannin concentrations (e.g., arrowleaf clover, kudzu) usually is safer, because tannins help break down rumen foam. The inclusion of poloxalene (10 to 20 mg/kg daily) in the feed or mineral supplement is useful in preventing frothy bloat. If poloxalene supplements are used, keepers should feed them for 1 to 2 weeks before moving animals onto a problem pasture.",

Examples of such dietary changes are replacing oats with corn and changing from whole to ground corn. If the changes are drastic, rumen acidosis (discussed next) can occur. Other common causes are changes in hay or pasture, consumption of moldy hay, and ingestion of weeds and toxic plants after overgrazing or drought. Clinical manifestations include mild anorexia that lasts for 1 to 2 days; mild diarrhea and bloat also may be present. Rumen fluid pH may be unchanged, increased, or decreased, depending on the inciting cause. Most animals improve with no treatment. 1",

Although corn commonly is implicated, other cereal grains (oats, wheat, barley) may be the offending feedstuffs, particularly if they are finely ground. The smaller the particle size, the more quickly rumen bacteria are able to ferment the carbohydrates contained in the feed. The common name for this condition is \"grain overload,\" but breads, candy, apples and other fruits, beets, and potatoes also have been implicated as sources of the excess carbohydrates.",

Fluid is drawn from the systemic circulation into the rumen, resulting in dehydration and possibly hypovolemic shock. Lactate concentrations increase in the blood, potentially leading to systemic lactic acidosis. The lactic acid in the rumen also is toxic to the rumen epithelium. Damage to the epithelium can result in leakage of bacteria and toxins into the portal and systemic circulation. Chronic sequelae to rumen acidosis include fungal rumenitis and occasionally formation of liver abscesses. 1, 7 Liver abscesses are less commonly encountered in sheep and goats than in cattle. Laminitis also can occur but may be more of a problem in sheep than in goats. 8 The severity of the disease depends on the composition of the feed, particle size, amount of feed consumed, and the period of adaptation to the diet.",

NSAIDs are indicated to control the pain and inflammation of toxemia (flunixin meglumine, 1.1 to 2.2 mg/kg IV). 1, 12 Oral administration of magnesium hydroxide and magnesium oxide (1 g/kg) may neutralize the acidic pH and is sufficient in mild cases. However, if much of the feed is still in the rumen, these two alkalizing agents will only work temporarily. Oral antibiotics have been recommended to kill rumen microflora and stop fermentation. We believe that these agents are contraindicated, however, because the gramnegative anaerobes that need to flourish to reestablish normal rumen microflora are susceptible to most antimicrobials effective against Lactobacillus species. Removing the substrate for growth of Lactobacillus organisms is more effective. Because orogastric tubes with largeenough bores for reflux of feedstuffs are too large for sheep and goats, rumenotomy is indicated in severe cases to remove the feed (see earlier under \"Rumenotomy\"). After the rumen pH is corrected, transfaunation of the rumen microflora with approximately 1 qt of rumen fluid from another small ruminant is beneficial (Box 5-1). Thiamine supplementation (vitamin B 1 , 5 mg/lb SC, three to four times a day) is indicated until rumen function returns. 11 In certain instances, calcium may be indicated and can be added to the intravenous fluids (as calcium gluconate).

            "text": "To reduce rumen fill in sheep or goats requiring rumenotomy, ideally feed should be withheld for 24 hours before surgery. Such preparation usually is impossible, however, because in most cases rumenotomy is an emergency procedure. The perioperative administration of antimicrobial agents is essential, because even with meticulous technique, some contamination of the incision site and possibly the peritoneal cavity is inevitable. Because the rumen microflora is composed predominantly of anaerobic bacteria, penicillin (22,000 IU/kg) is the antimicrobial agent of choice and should be administered 2 to 4 hours before surgery. If the rumenotomy is being performed on an emergency basis, penicillin salts (potassium or sodium), which can be given by the intravenous route, provide therapeutic concentrations more rapidly than can procaine penicillin. NSAIDs (e.g., flunixin meglumine, 1.1 to 2.2 mg/kg IV) also are recommended before surgery. If necessary, treatment of cardiovascular shock and dehydration with intravenous fluids also should begin before surgery and continue until the animal is rehydrated and in stable condition (see Chapter 3). Rumenotomy more commonly is done with the small ruminant in right lateral recumbency, because the standing patient is likely to become recumbent anyway during the procedure; either the animal will need to be restrained on some elevated surface, or the practitioner will have to operate while kneeling. The procedure can be safely done with use of local anesthesia, usually assisted by sedation in most animals. The use of general anesthesia may be considered in fractious or very valuable animals, to decrease the potential for abdominal contamination (see Chapter 18) . The clinician should clip and surgically prepare a square area from 5 cm in front of the last rib to the tuber coxae, and from the dorsal midline to the lower abdomen, encompassing the entire left paralumbar fossa.",

            "text": "The routine skin and body wall incision is made in the middle of the left paralumbar fossa. The surgeon makes a skin incision approximately 5 cm longer than a handwidth, 5 cm caudal and parallel to the last rib. The incision is continued through the muscle layers into the abdomen. Because the abdominal wall is relatively thin, the surgeon should take care not to enter the rumen or bowel. The body wall incision must be more than adequate in size to facilitate entry of the practitioner's hand and possibly forearm, to allow exploration of the rumen and evacuation of its contents. The rumen incision will be smaller than the body wall incision after the rumen is secured to the skin. After the body wall incision has been made, a thorough exploration of the abdominal cavity should be performed before the rumen is secured to the skin. (note: Exploration of the abdominal cavity is absolutely contraindicated after the rumen has been opened.) After abdominal exploration, the rumen is secured to the skin by creating a watertight seal with continuous suture. The watertight seal is critical in preventing abdominal contamination. The rumen is secured to the skin with use of monofilament (or coated) suture with minimal drag in the tissue on a cutting needle in a Cushing pattern. The first \"bite\" is taken in the skin at either 3 or 9 o'clock ( Figure 5-7) ; then the second bite is taken in the rumen at that location in the opposite direction. The suture is then tied and the tail left long. To prevent or minimize leakage, the rumen suture bites should be through the seromuscular layer but not penetrate the mucosa, which could lead to leakage at closure. The Cushing pattern is continued from the midpoint of the incision to the dorsal-and ventralmost aspects of the body wall incision, where a modification resembling a W stroke is done to ensure a seal at those areas. If the practitioner starts at the 9 o'clock point and sutures dorsally, the following technique is used at the dorsalmost part of the body wall incision: The standard bite (approximately \u00bc inch) is made in the rumen near the end of the body wall incision; then the suture is passed superficial and dorsal to the end of the incision by approximately 2 inches before a bite is taken in the skin toward the incision. The suture then is passed superficially to the dorsalmost part of the rumen, where a transverse bite (perpendicular to the suture line) is taken in the rumen. The suture is again passed superficial and dorsal to the body wall incision, where a skin bite is made parallel to and at the same level as the previous skin suture. Then the Cushing pattern is continued from the dorsalmost (12 o'clock) position down to the 3 o'clock location, where the suture is tied. The same procedure then is followed from 3 o'clock ventrally to 6 o'clock, where the dorsalmost suture pattern is repeated and continued to the originating 9 o'clock position, where the suture is tied. Two separate suture lines are used to limit the circumferential decrease in lumen size created by one suture line pulled tightly. If an assistant is available, each operator can work simultaneously on the two separate suture lines. The rumen can now be rolled over the skin to create a watertight seal ( Figure 5-8) . The rumenotomy incision is then made in the center of the exposed, secured rumen ( Figure 5-9 ). Once the rumen has been secured and opened, no other modifications should be made to the rumenotomy. The rumen contents can be evacuated by hand, which will lead to significant contamination of the field-thereby showing that a watertight seal is imperative ( Figure 5-10 ). If the contents are very liquid, a large tube can be used to siphon the rumen. In such instances, care must be taken to guard the end of the tube, to prevent occlusion of flow by suction of the rumen wall over the end of the tube.",

Suturing of this second layer should start at one end of the rumen incision, and retention sutures securing the rumen to the skin are removed as needed to free enough rumen for closure.

Decades of research have been devoted to the study of the pathophysiology of infectious diarrhea in calves; the pathphysiologic picture in lambs and kids is quite similar. Despite improvements in management practices and prevention and treatment strategies, diarrhea is still the most common and costly disease affecting neonatal ruminants. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Some general preventive measures (e.g., improved sanitation) will decrease the risk of diarrheal disease from any cause. By contrast, specific control measures such as vaccination require the definition of a specific cause of diarrhea. Table 5 -2 lists the agents most likely to cause diarrhea in lambs and kids, tissues or other samples required for diagnosis, and commonly used test methods. The color and consistency of the feces and any gross lesions can appear similar with numerous diseases. Laboratory identification of infectious agents and tissue histopathologic examination are therefore key to establishing a diagnosis (see Chapters 16 and 20) . Because autolysis and secondary bacterial invasion of the gut begin within minutes of death, necropsy samples taken immediately from euthanized lambs and kids yield the most reliable diagnostic material. Mixed infections with two or more pathogens are common, and clinically important farm-specific pathogens change from year to year. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] In some cases an underlying nutritional deficiency or excess may be present concurrently with infective disease. The clinician should therefore take a variety of samples to ensure identification of all pathogens and predisposing factors involved; continued reevaluation of the causes of diarrhea is crucial. Evaluation of material from multiple cases, with a focus on those in the acute phases, is important. Although examination of antemortem fecal samples can be diagnostic, laboratory testing of tissue samples may yield better results.",

After the organism attaches to the villi, it produces the second virulence factor, enterotoxin. Enterotoxin interferes with the normal physiology of the gut, with resultant diarrhea. 8 Calves have an age-associated resistance that probably is related to the blocking of fimbrial attachment to the gut, so ETEC diarrheal disease occurs mainly in calves younger than 1 week of age. 9, 10 The mode of infection is fecal-oral.

Because ETEC causes a secretory-type diarrhea, bicarbonate loss in the diarrhea leads to severe acidosis, with lambs and kids quickly becoming dehydrated and recumbent. However, many infected animals die before developing diarrhea. Affected neonates are depressed, stop nursing, and may show excessive salivation. Fluid sequestration in the abomasum produces a splashing sound on movement. This condition is associated with high mortality if animals are not treated promptly. 7, 8 Diagnosis Fecal culture and serotyping for the K99 and F41 fimbrial antigens constitute the basis for diagnosis. Because many nonpathogenic E. coli bacteria are normal gut inhabitants, growth of this organism on cultures usually is an insignificant finding. 8 Occasionally the bacteria do not express the fimbrial antigens in culture, so ETEC cannot be ruled out if the culture is negative for K99 and F41. 11 Histopathologic evidence of colonization of the small intestine can support a diagnosis.",

In type C infection, a beta toxin can cause acute hemorrhagic enteritis. Type C infection is seen mostly in lambs or kids younger than 3 weeks of age. An epsilon toxin is responsible for pathologic findings in type D infections. Enterotoxemia usually is seen in rapidly growing feedlot lambs on high-concentrate rations. It also is associated with other feeding changes, including changes in type of pasture. However, it occasionally has been reported in the absence of any dietary changes, particularly in goats. 4, 7, 45 This disease commonly occurs in the fastest-growing and most wellconditioned animals.

This is true especially of type A, for which a role in actual disease is controversial. 46 Histopathologic examination of sections of the gut can be helpful.

Goats may not respond as well to vaccination as sheep do, so biannual, triannual, or quarterly vaccination is recommended, especially in herds in disease-endemic areas. 4, 39 Vaccination with only C. perfringens type C and type D vaccines and tetanus toxoid is superior to the use of more polyvalent clostridial vaccines. 4 Reducing the energy density of the diet and avoiding sudden dietary changes or alterations in the feeding routine are crucial to prevention.

Animals with only mild diarrhea, especially mild nutritional diarrhea, may not require therapy unless they become dehydrated. If kids or lambs become less than 8% dehydrated and are only mildly depressed but still willing to nurse, they can be treated with oral electrolytes designed for calves. Fluids can be administered by bottle or by feeding tube (~ 18-24 inch, 3/8 inch diameter, catheter tip) if the animal will not nurse. The keeper or the clinician should carefully adjust the amount of fluids for lambs and kids (250 to 500 mL [8 to 16 oz], as opposed to 4 L in a calf). Because most electrolyte solutions designed for calves contain glucose, they should be refrigerated after they have been mixed and any leftovers discarded within 24 hours. Intravenous fluids may be needed to treat more severe dehydration. If the lamb or kid is too weak to stand, intravenous fluids are indicated. Isotonic fluids containing electrolytes should be given to replenish losses. Glucose can be added to make a 1% to 2.5% solution. Sodium bicarbonate also may be administered, especially if the dehydration is severe. A rule of thumb is to give one fourth of the calculated fluid needed as isotonic bicarbonate (1.3%). Extra potassium (10 to 20 mEq/L) can be added to fluids, because most animals are severely dehydrated from diarrhea and depleted in potassium, even though their blood potassium levels may be elevated. If extra potassium is added, acidosis must be corrected concurrently. After correcting the dehydration, the keeper or the clinician can offer oral electrolyte-enriched fluids to replace ongoing losses caused by continued diarrhea (see also Chapter 3).",

Young animals need nutrients, and even high-energy, glucose-containing electrolyte solutions are no substitute for milk.

Animals being hand-fed should be offered small amounts frequently to help minimize problems. Electrolytes should never be mixed with milk but should instead be given in separate feedings. If lactase deficiency is suspected, lactase drops or capsules (available in health food stores) can be added to milk or milk replacer. 39 NSAIDs (e.g., flunixin meglumine, 1.1 to 2.2 mg/kg IV, or ketoprofen, 3 mg/kg IV) are beneficial, especially if toxemia is involved, as in ETEC, enterotoxemia, and salmonellosis. Antimicrobial agents should be reserved for proven outbreaks of salmonellosis and for animals with other causes of diarrhea that do not respond to fluid therapy and NSAIDs; these drugs should be administered only parenterally. Oral coating agents and antacids are popular, but such agents have not been shown to be beneficial, and their use is not therapeutically logical in light of the pathogenesis of these diseases. The therapeutic use of probiotics is questionable, but anecdotal reports suggest they may be beneficial in reestablishing the normal flora of the small intestine.

Lambs or kids born as twins or triplets, weak or injured neonates, those born during severe weather, those born from a dam with dystocia, and those delivered by cesarean section all are candidates for colostrum supplementation. Supplemental colostrum should be good-quality colostrum from females that have tested negative for Johne's disease, ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP), and caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE). Mixing colostrum from several cows decreases the incidence of the \"cow colostrum-associated\" hemolytic disease sometimes seen in lambs. If the lamb or kid is unable to nurse, it should be tube fed 50 mL/kg of colostrum. The veterinarian or animal handler can sit comfortably holding the lamb or kid in sternal recumbency in the lap. A 12 to 14 French soft feeding tube is then lubricated, inserted into the side of the mouth, and passed slowly to the depth of the thoracic inlet. If the tube is placed in the trachea, the lamb or kid will show signs of discomfort and may shake and cough. The tube may be palpated on the left side of the throat.

Good sanitation in lambing and kidding areas is paramount in management programs that stress prevention. The presence of organic matter interferes with the effectiveness of many disinfectants, so removal and proper disposal of feces, carcasses, and placentas are essential. When disposing of waste material containing either Cryptosporidium or Giardia, the keeper should be careful to avoid contaminating water sources. Infected animals should be isolated to prevent spread of the infection throughout the flock or herd. In general, infected animals should remain in the environment where the infection was first diagnosed, because it is already contaminated. Removing pregnant ewes or dams to a clean area before lambing or kidding helps minimize the continued spread of disease. If possible, lambs and kids already born but not showing clinical signs should be removed to a third area. If \"safe\" pastures are maintained for internal nematode control, they are ideal for use in an emergency situation to control these diseases (see also Chapter 6) . Although some animals may appear normal, they may be incubating and possibly shedding the infective agents of disease. If such animals are moved with pregnant females, they can be a source of contamination in a clean area.

Feces of noninfected sheep and goats within heavily infected herds can yield a positive culture from oral-fecal pass-through of the organism. Sheep strains of Johne's disease and some goat variant strains seem to be more difficult to culture in media used to identify cattle strains of the disease. Therefore fecal culture in sheep and goats appears to be of limited benefit in a clinical setting. 4, 5 A relatively inexpensive and easily performed method of identifying approximately 50% of all clinically infected animals is acid-fast staining of fecal smears. 3, 4 A PCR fecal assay also is available, but its sensitivity is lower than that of fecal culture. Good diagnostic results can be obtained with serologic testing for antibodies (e.g., agar gel immunodiffusion [AGID] test, enzyme-linked immunospecific assay [ELISA], complement fixation test) in animals showing clinical signs. The specificity of all of the serologic tests is greater than 95% in sheep and goats with signs of clinical disease, although the sensitivity is not as high. 4-7 Therefore a positive serologic test result in an animal showing clinical signs indicates that the animal has Johne's disease. However, the disease cannot be ruled out with a negative test result. Identification of subclinically infected animals using serologic tests is more problematic. A sensitivity of approximately 50% is all that should be expected. With the ELISA and complement fixation test, cross-reactivity with Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis may occur, thereby limiting the value of such testing in flocks with caseous lymphadenitis infections. 4, 8 ELISA performed on milk samples from goats had reduced sensitivity but increased specificity (less cross-reaction) compared with serum ELISA. 9 Sheep and goats appear to respond differently with regard to the formation of antibodies. In sheep, antibodies tend to develop in the later stages of the disease, whereas antibodies may be detected much earlier in the goat. Necropsy diagnosis is based on the finding of thickened, corrugated intestines, especially in the area of the ileum. Acid-fast staining of impression smears (taken from the ileum and ileocecal lymph nodes) can help yield a quick diagnosis. The staining of numerous clumps of acid-fast rods is highly suggestive of Johne's disease.",

Keepers and herdsmen should cull the offspring of infected animals. Culling animals on the basis of the results of flock/herd -wide AGID testing or ELISA and fecal culture is recommended. Animals should be tested at least once a year. More frequent testing as resources allow will speed the identification of infected animals.

This finding is more common in males. In females with atresia ani, rectovaginal fistula with defecation through the vagina is a common finding.

This bulge in the skin indicates the rectum is most likely immediately cranial to the imperforate skin. For surgical correction, the area around the anus is clipped if needed and scrubbed for surgery. Epidural or local anesthesia is obtained. The clinician should first make a stab incision through the imperforate skin to identify the rectum. When feces are seen to freely exit this incision, it can be converted to an X-shaped incision; in such cases, a patent anus will be maintained by expulsion of feces. Some surgeons prefer to make a circular incision, which will be less likely to heal together, once again obstructing defecation. With this circular incision, repair is best accomplished by securing the rectal mucosa to the edge of the incised skin with absorbable suture placed at four points equidistant around the circular skin incision. The space between these sutures can then be closed with either short segments of continuous suture or additional separate sutures. The mucosa-to-skin suture procedure is not very difficult in a tractable patient with use of appropriate regional anesthesia. Use of this closure technique is imperative if the rectum terminates further cranial to the skin and some dissection with caudal traction on the rectum is required.

A pursestring suture of nonabsorbable suture material (3-5 nylon suture material) is then placed in the skin around the anus, tightened around the tubular object, and tied off. For placement of the suture, a cutting needle is used, entering and exiting at the 12 o'clock position. Tying the knot above the anus ensures that less fecal soiling of the suture will occur. The clinician should tie the suture in a bow knot to allow easy identification over the next few days and then remove the tubular object. The suture should be tight enough to prevent prolapse but loose enough to allow feces to pass. The clinician should regularly reevaluate the animal and if possible gradually loosen the pursestring suture at 24-hour intervals until no tension exists. After a full day of no tension, the suture can be removed. If the animal continues to strain, an epidural anesthetic can be administered. Petroleum jelly and hemorrhoid gel should be placed on the anus daily. 5, 9 The injection of counterirritants (1 mL or less of Lugol's iodine) around the rectum, either alone or in conjunction with anal pursestring suturing, is a quick and inexpensive treatment. 5, 6, 9 The clinician inserts an 18-gauge needle (5 cm) deeply into the skin around the anus at the 12, 3, and 9 o'clock positions.

The clinician places two spinal needles (9 to 10 cm) at a 90-degree angle to each other 2 to 4 mm distal to the anal sphincter and through the entire depth of prolapsed tissue. 5 A circular incision is made 2 to 4 mm distal to the spinal needles through the mucosa and around the outside of the anus. Another circular incision is made just distal to the caudal extent of the prolapse into the point at which the mucosa reflects on itself on the inner side of the prolapse. The clinician connects these two incisions with a longitudinal incision parallel to the prolapse and dissects the mucosa between the circumferential incisions. 5 The mucosal edges are then brought together using a suitable absorbable suture material in a simple interrupted pattern. After completion of this suturing, the clinician removes the two spinal needles and places a pursestring suture in the anal sphincter. Placement of the suture and follow-up care are the same as described for the pursestring suture technique. Submucosal resection decreases the incidence of both peritonitis and stricture formation compared with other surgical techniques, but it is costly to perform. 5 With all of these techniques, use of a caudal epidural anesthetic (e.g., 2% lidocaine, 0.5 mL/45 kg of body weight) is recommended to decrease straining and ease pain associated with the procedure. 6,7 A xylazine epidural (0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg in a quantity sufficient to make 2 mL, with 2% lidocaine) may give longer relief (approximately 4 to 6 hours) from straining than that obtainable with lidocaine. An alcohol epidural also may prevent straining for extended periods. Either isopropyl alcohol or ethanol can be used to demyelinate the motor and sensory nerves. 5 This type of anesthesia can be permanent and therefore should be used only in animals intended for slaughter. Because of the potential for some loss of sciatic nerve function, the clinician should perform a test injection of a local anesthetic",

            "text": "Pathogenesis Fatty liver occurs in conjunction with pregnancy toxemia in ewes and does during the last month of gestation. 3, 4 It is most common in both thin or obese ewes or does with a single large fetus, twins, or triplets. 1, [3] [4] [5] During late gestation, particularly in obese females, the abdominal space is filled with accumulated fat and an ever-expanding uterus. Because of the lack of rumen space, these animals have difficulty consuming enough feedstuffs to satisfy energy requirements. In most management systems, late gestation occurs during the winter months, when less pasture is available and poorer-quality feedstuffs are offered. Energy requirements for ewes and does carrying twins or triplets are greatly increased during the final 2 months of gestation, because 70% to 80% of fetal growth occurs during this time. Ewes with twins require 180% more energy, and those with triplets need 200% to 250% more dietary energy. Glucose maintenance in ewes pregnant with twins is significantly more prone to disturbance resulting in hypoglycemia than in ewes bearing singletons. 4 Pregnancy toxemia also occurs in association with anorexia caused by other diseases (e.g., foot rot, OPP, CAE) or sudden stresses (e.g., feed or weather changes, predator attacks, hauling). A period of anorexia or lack of sufficient energy intake will result in a negative energy balance. Affected animals begin to mobilize body stores of fat and transport them to the liver. In the liver, fat is catabolized to glycerol and free fatty acids (FFAs). FFAs can be used in the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) as an energy source, but not in the direct formation of glucose. Anorexic animals have less ruminal substrate available for production of the glucose precursor propionic acid. However, oxaloacetate, which is an integral part of the citric acid cycle, is removed from the cycle and converted into glucose. Depletion of oxaloacetate inhibits the normal citric acid cycle's function, thereby inhibiting the use of FFAs. As the pool of FFAs increases, they are converted to ketone bodies or repackaged into lipoproteins. Because ruminants are not efficient at transporting lipoproteins out of the liver and back to the adipose stores, the lipoproteins overwhelm the liver's ability to handle fats, leading to a massive buildup and resulting in a fatty liver. Because less substrate is available for glucose formation, more oxaloacetate is \"cannibalized\" from the citric acid cycle, further inhibiting the body's ability to use FFAs. This impairment in turn results in the continued accumulation of ketones. Hypoglycemia, hyperketonemia, and potentially uremia and death can occur.",

Chemically inducing parturition (by administering 2.5 to 10 mg of prostaglandin F 2 \u03b1 or 0.75 \u03bcg/45 kg of cloprostenol in does and 15 to 20 mg of dexamethasone in ewes) and giving the ewe or doe medical support (fluids, B vitamins, glucose) while waiting is a useful protocol in some cases. Unfortunately, during the time before parturition, endotoxemia from dead fetuses further compromises the female's well-being. For this reason, we recommend immediate cesarean section in depressed moribund animals (see Chapter 8) . The owner should be forewarned of the poor prognosis for animals already in a moribund state.

In overconditioned females, the keeper should be encouraged to restrict institution of weight loss programs to early gestation (if at all) and to avoid abrupt feeding changes, while promoting exercise (e.g., by increasing walking distances from mineral access to shelter). The requirement for energy may be one and a half to two times maintenance for dams with single fetuses and two to three times maintenance for those with multiple fetuses. Prevention of concurrent disease, which may further increase energy demands or cause anorexia (e.g., intestinal parasitism, foot rot), is crucial. The keeper should take care to increase the grain portion of the diet slowly, and ensure the consistent availability of fresh, clean water, as anorexia from rumen upset can lead to pregnancy toxemia. Ewes should be offered 0.5 to 1 kg of a cereal grain (corn, oats, barley, or a combination) every day during the final months of gestation; does can be offered \u00bd to 1 kg of grain.

Toxicity results from chronic accumulation in the liver from the ingestion of excess copper in relation to molybdenum or sulfate in the diet. In sheep, a copper-to-molybdenum ratio greater than 10:1 leads to the accumulation of excess copper. The most common sources of excess copper in sheep and goats are trace mineral mixtures and feeds formulated for cattle or horses. Clinical signs often are absent during the chronic accumulation phase. Onset of acute disease is related to the sudden release of copper from the liver in large amounts. Stress usually precipitates this acute phase. Acute release of copper and subsequent high blood copper concentrations cause an acute hemolytic crisis, resulting in anemia, hemoglobinuria, and acute renal failure. Existing hepatic disease (such as that caused by liver flukes) may predispose animals to this condition. Some breeds (e.g., Merino sheep) seem to be prone to copper absorption and storage problems, whereas others (e.g., pygmy goats) tend to be more resistant and prone to deficiency (see Chapter 2).",

            "text": "Treatment of acutely affected animals often is futile. Appropriate management consists of supportive therapy for the acute renal failure and anemia and attempts to lower liver copper stores. Fluid therapy for the acute renal failure (see Chapter 3) is of clinical benefit, and a blood transfusion may be needed if the PCV drops precipitously. Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (1.7 mg/kg IV or 3.4 mg/kg SC on alternate days for three treatments) is the most economical agent for treatment in acute cases. In valuable animals, oral d-penicillamine (26 to 50 mg/kg twice daily or 52 mg/kg once daily for 6 days) increases urinary copper excretion. Trientine is used in human beings but has shown variable results in sheep. Treatment of the remainder of the flock should include the oral administration of ammonium molybdate (50 to 500 mg/head/day) and sodium thiosulfate (300 to 1000 mg/head/day) for 3 weeks. Stress should be minimized, so keepers and clinicians should delay routine maintenance procedures such as deworming and hoof trimming until after treatment. When applicable, spraying a combination of ammonium molybdate and sodium sufate onto harvested forages low or deficient in copper to approximate the required therapeutic amount will decrease the stress required in daily oral dosing of chemicals. Allowing free access to grazing of forages high in sulfur (greater than 0.5% sulfur), if available, for all surviving ambulatory animals also may help to minimize death losses in a flock or herd. Overzealous attempts to clear excessive hepatic copper stores may potentially lead to deficiency, excessively stress the animal, and can be costly, thus should be avoided. The offending source of copper should be eliminated. Caution should be taken in such cases to remove ionophores from the diet, because these agents may contribute to copper absorption. 19 Prevention Avoiding high dietary copper (more than 10 ppm), a high copper-to-molybdenum ratio (greater than 10:1) in the feed, use of copper-containing foot baths, and other sources of copper is crucial. Including supplemental molybdenum in the diet to lower the copper-tomolybdenum ratio to 6:1 to 8:1 is beneficial. Addition of up to 2 to 6 ppm of molybdenum may be required in many instances.",

AP concentrations also are not liver-specific, but increased serum levels of GGT are very specific for liver disease. GGT also increases in some hepatocellular diseases, so testing for normal concentrations is important. 18 Unfortunately, levels of all of these enzymes can be normal with liver disease, especially if it is chronic.

The clinician should either lightly sedate the animal or infiltrate the skin around the hernia with a local anesthetic (e.g., 2% lidocaine). The animal is placed on its back and held by a technician helper. Any viscera prolapsing into the hernial sac should be replaced into the abdomen. The empty hernia sac and skin should then be tented away from the body wall to allow placement of an elastrator band as close as possible to the body wall. The clinician then inserts two metal pins (old fashioned baby diaper pins can be used) through the skin and hernia sac in a crossing fashion just distal to the elastrator band, so as to keep the elastrator band in place immediately adjacent to the external rectus sheath. Pinning in this fashion will result in ischemic necrosis of the tissue distal to the elastrator band and enough inflammation of the tissue that the hernia ring adheres closed. The skin and hernia sac distal to the elastrator band will slough and the abdominal defect will heal in 7 to 14 days. Lambs should be given tetanus prophylaxis. This procedure and other clamping techniques are useful in females and some males. However, urine scalding of the skin may occur in some males. Clinicians should closely monitor animals that have undergone clamping for signs of abdominal discomfort or wound complications.",

The animal can be sedated and the skin of the umbilical region then infiltrated with a local anesthetic, or general anesthesia can be used. The area around the hernia is clipped and surgically prepared. The clinician makes an elliptical skin incision around the hernia sac and dissects down to the hernia ring at the external rectus sheath. The abdominal cavity is opened just cranial (or caudal) to the hernia ring on the linea alba to allow introduction of a finger into the abdominal cavity. The clinician uses this finger to digitally palpate the hernia ring to ensure that no viscera have adhered to the inner lining of the ring and that no enlarged or infected umbilical remnants (umbilical vein, umbilical arteries, or urachus) are present. The surgeon then carefully excises the hernial sac at the hernial ring. Any adhesions or abnormal umbilical remnants present are then excised before closure of the defect in the abdominal wall. This closure can be accomplished by simply opposing the incised edges of the external rectus sheath with absorbable suture in a simple continuous pattern. In the case of large hernias with tension on the body wall closure, a nearfar-far-near suture pattern may be used. As a matter of personal preference (that of A.N.B.), a near-far-far-near suture pattern can be used in the middle of the incision to relieve tension, with completion of the closure in a simple continuous suture pattern. This approach provides a secure repair with rapid healing. The subcutaneous tissue should be closed with absorbable suture in a simple continuous pattern, and the skin can be closed using whatever pattern the clinician prefers. Animals should be given tetanus prophylaxis and antibiotics. They should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis and surgical failure. Exercise should be limited for 7 to 14 days after surgery.",

Ultrasonographic evaluation may indicate presence of an abscess or thickened tissue. Patent urachus is associated with dermatitis, urine scalding of the ventral abdomen, and urine dribbling. If the urachus becomes infected, it may leak urine intraperitoneally or subcutaneously. Both of these developments may be identified by abdominal palpation, ballottement, ultrasonographic evaluation, and, when indicated, paracentesis. 1 The CBC may reveal neutrophilia. Blood culture is indicated if sepsis occurs simultaneously. Occasionally, infection of the internal structures may occur with no outward umbilical swelling. Deep abdominal palpation and the use of real-time ultrasound imaging are necessary to obtain a diagnosis.

Prolonged antibiotic therapy with a broadspectrum antimicrobial agent (ceftiofur, 2.2 mg/kg once a day, or oxytetracycline, 20 mg/kg SC every 72 hours) may be attempted. If medical therapy is ineffective, however, the infected umbilical remnants should be marsupialized or excised. We prefer more aggressive surgical removal of the umbilical remnants. As with urachal surgery, the abdomen should be opened lateral to the umbilicus. Depending on the severity of infection and the amount of tissue involved, the clinician may need to perform extensive dissection of necrotic tissue and possibly intestinal resection. 3 Surgical Management of Extensive Infection. If the infection of the umbilical vein extends to and involves the liver, marsupialization of the umbilical vein is an effective method of therapy. 2, 3 The clinician can pull the vein to the cranialmost portion of the abdominal incision and suture it to the muscle layers and skin before closing the abdomen as described for umbilical hernia repair. Our own preference, however, is to cover the transected end of the umbilical vein (with a sterile glove or surgical sponge) and pull it through a stab incision cranial to the hernia. It can then be secured in place with suture. The abdominal incision is then closed as described in hernia repair. This method of repair will minimize the incidence of abdominal wall herniation. Only monofilament, absorbable, non-gut suture material should be used. 3 The venous stump should be flushed daily with antiseptic solution (1% chlorhexidine or 0.1% povidone-iodine), and the animal should be maintained on antibiotics for more than 14 days. The venous stump usually closes within a month. 3 Very rarely, a second operation may be required to resect the previously infected umbilical vein.",
