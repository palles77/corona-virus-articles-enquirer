Simultaneously, experimental infections were induced in control mice using either L. major or L. m. amazonensis to confirm infectivity of the parasites. The Results Before the protective immunity assay, we examined the monoclonal antibodies with respect to their isotype and their target antigens. Most belonged to the IgG isotype IgGi and the others to IgGzb. Based on observation of strong fluorescent labelling of the L. major and L. m. amazonensis live promastigote surfaces, we selected one monoclonal antibody (64B16 : isotype Ig2b) as potentially protective. Fig.  1 indicates that pre-treatment of the two Leishmania species, with 64B16 abolished their capacity to induce Fig. 1 : Cutaneous leishmaniasis.

Furthermore, HOWARD et al. (1982) in prophylactic immunization against experimental leishmaniasis noted that antibody response may be crucial in resistance to the infection. They considered that the development of cell-mediated immunity in immunization might not be necessary. At the present time, as did HANDMAN & HOCKING (1982) and ANDERSON et al. (1983) , we report that antibodies, when used in an in vitro or an in vivo system, can abolish the development of parasites. The role of the complement (C') in this effect is controversial. It has been proved that antibody + C' caused the lysis of promastigotes (ADLER, 1964) . In our own experiments, decomplemented monoclonal antibody ascites were not able to prevent Leishmania infections. However, ANDER-SON et al. (1983) using one antibody of isotype IgG, suggests that the mechanism of this antibody-mediated protection may be C' independent. Finally, according to HANDMAN & HOCKING (1982) , isotype IgG,b promotes L. major killing in vitro and isotypes IgGra or IgGs are cytotoxic to promastigotes in the presence of complement. These last observations have to be confirmed in several in vivo systems to distinguish the mechanism by which these antibodies are protective. Their use may allow the identification of the Leishntania antigens inducing effective immunity.",
