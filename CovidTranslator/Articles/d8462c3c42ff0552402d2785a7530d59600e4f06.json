Nine out of ten evaluated flavonoids blocked HCMV replication at concentrations that were significantly lower than those producing cytotoxicity against growing or stationary phase host cells. Baicalein was the most potent inhibitor in this series (IC 50 = 0.4-1.2 M), including positive control ganciclovir. Baicalein and genistein were chosen as model compounds to study the antiviral mechanism(s) of action for this series. Both flavonoids significantly reduced the levels of HCMV early and late proteins, as well as viral DNA synthesis. Baicalein reduced the levels of HCMV immediate-early proteins to nearly background levels while genistein did not. The antiviral effects of genistein, but not baicalein, were fully reversible in cell culture. Pre-incubation of concentrated virus stocks with either flavonoid did not inhibit HCMV replication, suggesting that baicalein did not directly inactivate virus particles. Baicalein functionally blocked epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity and HCMV nuclear translocation, while genistein did not. At 24 h post infection HCMV-infected cells treated with genistein continued to express immediate-early proteins and efficiently phosphorylate IE1-72. However, HCMV induction of NF-B and increases in the levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins-events that are associated with immediate-early protein functioning -were absent. The data suggested that the primary mechanism of action for baicalein may be to block HCMV infection at entry while the primary mechanism of action for genistein may be to block HCMV immediate-early protein functioning.",

HCMV causes morbidities and mortalities in immunocompromised individuals such as transplant recipients and acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients (Landolfo et al., 2003; Davis et al., 1987) . HCMV surface glycoprotein ligands interact with cellular receptors to produce multiple cell growth and inflammatory signals that are reactivated once HCMV immediate-early proteins are expressed (Evers et 2004). Many of the pathways that HCMV employs to activate cell growth and inflammatory events are required for viral replication and may be useful targets for antiviral drug development.",

            "text": "It was with this goal in mind that we investigated the potential anti-HCMV activities of flavonoids. Over 5000 naturally occurring flavonoids have been found in dietary or other botanical sources and many are proposed to be responsible for the health benefits of certain folk remedies and dietary supplements (Beecher, 2003) . A number of biological properties have been described (or proposed) for various flavonoids. These include antioxidative, antiinflammatory, antiproliferative, and vasculoprotective effects (Gabor, 1986; Formica and Regelson, 1995) , and specific modulation of the activities of a number of cellular enzymes, including inhibition of protein kinases (Middleton et al., 2000) . Two properties of flavonoids predicted possible antiviral activity against HCMV. First, the replication of multiple viruses is inhibited by various flavonoids. Genistein was active against bovine herpesvirus type 1 (Akula et al., 2002) . 5,6,7-Trimethoxyflavone inhibited herpes simplex virus (HSV), HCMV, and poliovirus (Hayashi et al., 1997) . Quercetin was active against herpes simplex, adeno-, respiratory syncytial (RSV), Rous sarcoma, Sindbis, pseudorabies, and parainfluenza viruses (Chiang et al., 2003; Formica and Regelson, 1995) . Luteolin and quercetin inhibited the SARS coronavirus (Yi et al., 2004) . Kaempferol and its derivatives inhibited HSV, HCMV, and poliovirus (Amoros et al., 1992; Mitrocotsa et al., 2000; Robin et al., 2001) . Antiviral activity against several herpesviruses and respiratory viruses was reported for a series of biflavonoids (Lin et al., 1999) . Several glycosylated flavonoids were active against RSV or influenza A H1N1 (Wei et al., 2004) . Second, flavonoids affect signal transduction pathways that are required for HCMV replication. The effects of various flavonoids upon receptor tyrosine kinases, PI3-K, Akt, MAPKs, transcription factors, and prostaglandins vary according to the compound, compound concentration, stimulus, and cell type (Formica and Regelson, 1995; Middleton et al., 2000) .",

Nine out of ten compounds showed antiviral activity at concentrations below 40 M in at least one of the antiviral assays (Table 1) .

Western blot analyses revealed that all three kinetic classes of HCMV proteins were reduced to nearly background levels by baicalein (Fig. 2) . Fifty micromoles genistein reproducibly resulted in slightly lower levels of IE1-72 at 24 h post infection (hpi). IE2-86 levels were more sensitive to genistein, but were never reduced by more than 65%. Since IE1-72 is present prior to IE2-86 , we reasoned that the mechanism of action for genistein might be direct inhibition of IE1-72. IE1-72 is a protein kinase that autophosphorylates (Pajovic et al., 1997) . We reproducibly detected substantially the same amounts phosphorylated relative to total IE1-72 in the presence and absence of genistein (Fig. 2) . In contrast to its effects upon immediate-early proteins, genistein treatment resulted in an unambiguous block to HCMV early and late proteins. This flavonoid reduced UL84 and UL94 proteins to nearly background levels at 48 and 72 hpi, respectively (Fig. 2) .",

HCMV immediate-early proteins induce the p53 tumor suppressor protein (Muganda et al., 1994; Speir et al., 1994) , and p53 levels may provide some measure of immediate-early protein transactivation. We measured the ability of baicalein, genistein, and control viral DNA replication inhibitor ganciclovir to inhibit HCMV-mediated cell cycle regulatory protein induction at 24 hpi by immunoblotting (Fig. 4) . Increases in the steady-state levels of cdk2, cyclin E, p53, and PCNA were not affected by treatment with ganciclovir. The activation of these proteins by HCMV was inhibited by both baicalein and genistein. Genistein treatment did not always result in full inhibition of HCMV induction of these proteins (Fig. 4) , however, none were increased to levels reflecting those of immediate-early proteins as compared to HCMV positive controls in response to genistein (Fig. 2) .",

In contrast to its effects upon viral DNA (Fig. 3) and titer (Table 1) , the colorimetric assay detected little antiviral activity for positive control ganciclovir. A reproducible IC 50 of 9 M was reported for ganciclovir in the original description of this assay (Hippenmeyer and Dilworth, 1996) . In our adapted assay, we examined ganciclovir ten times and nine times obtained an IC 50 of >100 M (Table 1 and data not shown). It is possible that different infection conditions were responsible for this discrepancy. They infected fibroblasts by centrifuging virus (0.05 pfu/cell) onto trypsinized cell pellets, while we infected by adding supernatant virus (1.2 pfu/cell) to the media of adherent cells. Infecting cells with HCMV by centrifugation was elsewhere shown to accelerate (viral DNA replication was detectable at 16 instead of 56 hpi) and amplify (30-50 fold increased HCMV protein staining) HCMV replication (Ho et al., 1993; Gleaves et al., 1989) .

In general, flavones were the most active group of flavonoids examined. Among flavone and flavonol derivatives, those hydroxylated at the 6 position had greater anti-HCMV activities. Since naringenin was essentially inactive in both antiviral assays, it is possible that anti-HCMV activity requires aromatic conjugation or coplanar arrangement of the benzene rings. While baicalein was the most potent compound, it lost only 10-fold activity when conjugated to glucuronic acid at the 7 position (baicalin). Similarly, 3-glycosides of kaempferol were active against HCMV and less toxic than the parent compound (Mitrocotsa et al., 2000) . The two most potent and selective compounds in our series, baicalein and quercetin, have the same arrangement of hydroxyl substituents on the A ring as well as unsubstituted B rings. The most toxic compound in the series (luteolin) was dihydroxylated on the B ring.",
