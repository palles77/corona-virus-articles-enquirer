There is an urgent need for effective treatment. Current focus has been on the development of novel therapeutics, including antivirals and vaccines. Accumulating evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 might have a cytokine storm syndrome. We recommend identification and treatment of hyperinflammation using existing, approved therapies with proven safety profiles to address the immediate need to reduce the rising mortality.",

In adults, sHLH is most commonly triggered by viral infections 3 and occurs in 3\u00b77-4\u00b73% of sepsis cases. 4 Cardinal features of sHLH include unremitting fever, cytopenias, and hyperferritinaemia; pulmonary involvement (including ARDS) occurs in approximately 50% of patients. 5 A cytokine profile resembling sHLH is associated with COVID-19 disease severity, characterised by increased interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, granulocytecolony stimulating factor, interferon-\u03b3 inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1, and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1. 6 Predictors of fatality from a recent retrospective, multicentre study of 150 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China, included elevated ferritin (mean 1297\u00b76 ng/ml in nonsurvivors vs 614\u00b70 ng/ml in survivors; p<0\u00b7001) and IL-6 (p<0\u00b70001), 2 suggesting that mortality might be due to virally driven hyperinflammation.",
