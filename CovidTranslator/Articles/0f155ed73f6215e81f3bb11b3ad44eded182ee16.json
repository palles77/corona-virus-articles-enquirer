However, certain immunizations against diseases such as brucellosis, leptospirosis, and clostridial infections should be routine. Other diseases such as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine virus diarrhea, parainfluenza-3, colibacillosis, and pasteurellosis should be considered if it can be determined that the herd is infected chronically. The present knowledge of other disease conditions, vaccine effectiveness and safety makes the use of vaccines for other diseases of questionable value.",

Little thought is required to realize that the death loss of potentially great producers due to scours and pneumonia in the baby calf is a major difference between a financially rewarding and a marginal or bankrupt operation. Management and nutrition are the keys to the door of successful disease prevention. Prophylaxis and treatment can be considered only, at best, a second line of defense against decimating diseases of the dairy calf. The prevention of disease by enhancing the immune mechanisms of the baby calf to increase its resistance to disease never should become more important in the dairyman's mind than the strict adherence to good management practices and sound nutritional programs. Such sound principles as the assurance by the dairyman that the neonatal calf receives adequate amounts of antibodyladen colostrum within the first few hours of life cannot be overemphasized. Even though this practice has a sound immunologic basis, it will not be considered in this discussion except as it applies to specific vaccination programs. The purpose of this report is to make an unbiased evaluation of the many vaccines available and try to develop recommendations 1 for a reasonable vaccination program based upon scientific knowledge of the immunogenicity of the product, the resistance developed in the animal vaccinated, and the reasonable risk involved in not vaccinating the animal. The report is organized around bacterial and viral disease agents that may be expected in neonatal, young, and growing calves.",

The syndrome is due to the growth and circulation of pathogenic bacteria and their toxigenic products within the blood stream. The clinical signs of fever, hemorrhages in the mucosal surface, lethargy, prostration, and hypoxia are indications of a grave prognosis. The disease can be caused by bacteria in virtually every genera of bacteria, but the most common ones, Streptococci, Escbericbia, Salmonellae, Corynebacteria, Klebsiella, and Proteus, usually enter the blood stream through superficial wounds in the mucosaI surfaces or severed naval cords. The value of colostrum to prevent such serious infections is unknown. Maternal antibody could play an important role as a protective mechanism in light infections, but gross contamination always would overwhelm such protective mechanisms. No known vaccines to be used in the neonate have been effective nor would be expected tO be developed against these bacterial agents. Viremias are in the same category as the above, but both conditions seem to be reasonably rare.",

A review of the literature indicates that many different agents are involved in the pathogenesis of diarrheal disease of the neonatal calf. These agents may be singularly causal or may serve as concert pathogens in combined infections. They may be divided conveniently into bacteria and viral agents. Bacterial causes include such well known agents as Escbericbia coli (colibacillosis), Salmonella typbimurium, S. Dublin, and other sp. (Salmonellosis) and, occasionally, other genera of bacteria. The viral agents associated with pneumoenteritis include bovine virus diarrhea-mucosal disease virus (BVD), reovirus, coronavirus, adenoviruses, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), bovine parvoviruses, and probably enteroviruses.",

Colibacillosis may account for as many as 50% of the calf losses in a herd, and death rates of 10 to 20% are not uncommon. Because the disease strikes so early in life, it probably is not reasonable to believe that a vaccine could be developed that would immunize the individual effectively soon enough to prevent disease. Recent experimental data shows promise, however, in immunization of the dam with bacterins prepared from known pathogenic strains of the organism (31). Myers and his colleagues (30) have shown that effective resistance to experimentally induced cotibacillosis is induced in calves nursing dams immunized with bacterins injected subcutaneously 1 yr previously and 1 wk before the expected beginning of calving within the herd. The practice of preparing autogenous bacterins from E. coli strains isolated from problem herds to vaccinate dams has been recommended by veterinarians for years, but these reports are sound scientific evidence that the procedure is effective. Though commercial vaccines are not now available, Myers (30) reports that \"a commercial firm has prepared the vaccine for sale and will release it for marketing as soon as a license becomes available.\" He recommends that the primary vaccination be administered 6 mo before and a secondary booster be given 1 mo before the expected calving date. The effectiveness of such a vaccination program on experimental infections with the homologous strain of E. coil provides hope for the dairyman, but the results of this and other investigations (8, 11) must be verified carefully against the efficacy of the procedure on a routine herd basis. The impact of strain differences in vaccine development and immunospecificity cannot be predicted with certainty.",

The wide range of symptoms recorded (12, 16) exemplifies the complex nature of the disease in chronically infected herds. The agent is apparently widespread in dairy herds (16) , but each of these reports indicates that the widespread use of modified live virus vaccines may be responsible for some of the evidence for the existence of chronic infections. The intranasal type vaccine to prevent disease is recommended by workers actively pursuing research in this area (17) . The primary vaccination should be given at 4 to 6 days of age, a secondary booster vaccination should be given at 6 mo of age and again at one yr and annually thereafter. The dangers of a modified live virus vaccine causing overt disease in immunodeficient calves or of reverting to the virulent form at present cannot be evaluated properly. Our own research indicates that few passages in bovine tissue culture cells and an increase in the viral titer of the inoculum will cause similar lesions to the field strain when inoculated by the same routes and that recrudescence of the vaccine virus by chemical immunosuppression causes overt disease. The use and effectiveness of an attenuated nonabortigenic temperature sensitive mutant of IBR has been reported (41) . The theory behind such an effort is intriguing, but the vaccine must still be considered experimental.",
