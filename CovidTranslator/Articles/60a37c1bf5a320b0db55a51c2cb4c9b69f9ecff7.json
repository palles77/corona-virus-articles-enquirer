This pathway is found in all eukaryotic species, as well as in most DNA viruses and members of the family Reoviridae, and consists of the following reactions: hydrolysis of the \u03b3-phosphate of the primary transcript by an RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase (RTPase); transfer of GMP to the 5\u2032-diphosphate RNA (ppNp-RNA; in which N is the first transcribed nucleotide and p is a phosphate group) by a guanylyltransferase (GTase) through a 'ping-pong' mechanism, leading to the formation of GpppNp-RNA; and methyl ation of the guanosine moiety by a capspecific S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7MTase), providing the minimal RNA cap chemical structure, named cap-0 (m 7 GpppNp), which is recognized by the translation factor eIF4E 15 Following translation, the lifespan of an mRNA molecule is controlled by two main processes in eukary otic cells: first, the removal of its poly(A) tail and subsequent 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonucleolytic degradation, and second, an mRNA-decapping step that allows 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 exo nucleolytic degradation (see REFS 17, 18 for a review). Interestingly, decapped RNA may apparently be re-capped by the combined action of an as-yetunknown 5\u2032-monophosphate kinase 19 interacting with a host cell GTase that is also present in minor amounts in the cytoplasm (see REF. 20 for a review). Cytoplasmic decapping is catalysed by DCPS, a member of the NUDIX hydrolase superfamily, and stimulated by decapping enhancer proteins. Following RNA decapping in P-bodies, transcripts are quickly degraded by 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 exonucleases such as XRN1. Thus, 5\u2032-triphosphate mRNAs are almost completely absent in the cytoplasm. The eukaryotic cell has consequently evolved mechanisms to sense triphosphate RNA as non-self and uses these RNA species to trigger an innate immune response 6, 7 . Viruses are the most common cell invaders to produce cytoplasmic mRNAs and have therefore been under a selective pressure to evolve Figure 1 | RNA cap structure and canonical capping mechanisms. a | The mRNA cap consists of a 7-methylguanosine linked to the 5\u2032 nucleoside of the mRNA chain through a 5\u2032-5\u2032 triphosphate bridge. The methyl group at the N7 position of the guanosine is shaded green, and the 2\u2032-O-methyl groups of the first and second nucleotide residues, forming the cap-1 and the cap-2 structures, respectively, are shaded red. b | The cap-0 structure is formed on nascent RNA chains by the sequential action of three enzymes. First, the RNA triphosphatase (RTPase) hydrolyses the \u03b3-phosphate of the nascent RNA (pppNp-RNA, in which N denotes the first transcribed nucleotide and p denotes a phosphate group) to yield a diphosphate RNA (ppNp-RNA) and inorganic phosphate (P i ). Then, guanylyltransferase (GTase) reacts with the \u03b1-phosphate of GTP (Gppp), releasing pyrophosphate (PP i ) and forming a covalent enzyme-guanylate intermediate (Gp-GTase). The GTase then transfers the GMP molecule (Gp) to the 5\u2032-diphosphate RNA to create GpppNp-RNA. In the final step, (guanine-N7)methyltransferase (N7MTase) transfers the methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to the cap guanine to form the cap-0 structure, 7-methyl-GpppNp (m 7 GpppNp), and releases S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) as a by-product. counteracting mechanisms to conceal their RNA 5\u2032 ends from the innate immunity machineries of the host cell. Some viruses, such as those in the family Picornaviridae (single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses (ss(+)RNA viruses); for example, polioviruses and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)) recruit the 43S pre-initiation complex in a 5\u2032-cap-independent manner (BOX 1). Other viruses (for example, viruses of the family Caliciviridae, which are also ss(+)RNA viruses) covalently attach their RNA 5\u2032 end to a VPg-like protein, which directly interacts with the cap-binding protein eIF4E and initiates translation of viral mRNAs 21 . In members of the Picornaviridae, VPg may be lost before translation 22,23 . However, by far the most common viral mechanism for ensuring efficient translation of viral proteins and avoiding immune surveillance mechanisms is through the acquisition of a cap structure. The remarkable diversity of mechanisms that lead to an RNA cap structure identical to that of the host cell mRNAs is described below.",

            "text": "Conventional capping of viral RNA Even when the viral replication cycle includes a nuclear phase, any virus entering a host cell must express its genes in the cytoplasm using the host translation machinery. Viral genomes can be made of singlestranded or double-stranded nucleic acids, either RNA or DNA, and the corresponding strategies used for protecting their RNA transcripts are outlined in FIG. 2. Cap structures can be added to viral RNAs by one of the three following mechanisms. In the first mechanism, most viruses that synthesize their mRNA using cellular RNA pol II use the cellular capping machinery (FIGs 1b,2), as exemplified by most DNA viruses (except for those from the dsDNA virus family Poxviridae) and by RNA viruses such as those of the family Retroviridae (ss(+)RNA viruses) and the family Bornaviridae Box 1 | Getting around the lack of capping Some viruses (such as single-stranded positive-sense RNA (ss(+)RNA) viruses from the families Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae and Astroviridae) do not have a cap structure at the 5\u2032 end of their mRNAs or genomic RNAs. Rather, they covalently attach to the 5\u2032 RNA end a protein termed VPg 21 and/or carry an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) structure in the 5\u2032 untranslated region 154 . IRESs have now been found in many different cellular and viral RNAs, including those of ss(+)RNA viruses from the families Picornaviridae and Dicistroviridae, the genus Lentivirus and the Flaviviridae genera Hepacivirus and Pestivirus. In pestiviruses, genomic RNA remains in a 5\u2032-triphosphate form and thus promotes high levels of expression of host interferon-stimulated genes. However, these viruses also trigger several pathways that limit the antiviral response 155, 156 , resulting in a competitive advantage for IRES-dependent translation of viral genes 157 . (single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses (ss(-)RNA viruses)). A second strategy consists of acquiring cap structures from cellular mRNAs by 'cap snatching' (FIGS 2, 3) . RNA viruses such as members of the families Orthomyxoviridae, Arenaviridae and Bunyaviridae -which are ss(-)RNA viruses, with the latter two families also referred to as ambisense RNA viruses -steal short, capped cellular mRNAs through endonucleolytic cleavage. The stolen short, capped mRNAs are then used by the viral polymerase to prime synthesis of viral RNA. The box indicates viruses that acquire their cap structures using such a capping pathway. c | the RNA-capping mechanism of (-)RNA viruses such as those of the family Orthomyxoviridae; this mechanism is referred to as cap snatching. The PB2 subunit of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) binds to the 5\u2032 end of cellular capped mRNAs (which are enriched in the processing (P)-bodies), and the PA subunit then releases short capped RNAs by using its endonuclease (EndoN) activity. These capped RNAs are used as primers by the viral RdRp in viral transcription to generate viral mRNA using the viral (-)RNA as a template. The RdRp then synthesizes the complementary negative-sense strand. The box provides example of viruses that acquire their cap structures using a similar capping pathway. Note that most of the mRNAs that are capped by viral enzymes are indistinguishable from cellular mRNAs and can be translated into proteins by the cellular ribosomal machinery.

The RTPase reaction proceeds in two steps, starting with entry of the 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA into the activesite tunnel and formation of a covalent cysteinyl-S-phosphoester adduct. The catalytic cysteine responsible for the nucleophilic attack on the \u03b3-phosphate of the RNA 5\u2032 end belongs to a P-loop motif (HCXXXXXR(T/S)). The second step releases inorganic phosphate. Cysteine phosphatases adopt a characteristic \u03b1-\u03b2 fold with a central twisted, five-stranded parallel \u03b2-sheet flanked by six \u03b1-helices 49 . The catalytic cysteine that specifically recognizes the \u03b3-phosphate of the RNA 5\u2032 end resides at the bottom of the substrate-binding pocket, whereas other conserved residues from the P-loop, together with surrounding residues, form a positively charged channel that can accommodate the \u03b1-phosphate and the \u03b2-phosphate of the RNA 5\u2032 end. The shape of the binding pocket dictates the selectivity for triphosphate RNA and seems too deep to grant diphosphate RNA access to the active site.",

Several dsRNA viruses encode structural proteins that are packaged with their genome in the viral particle and are able to perform the four reactions needed to synthesize a cap-1 structure, much like an assembly line (FIG. 4c) . The key molecular components of the RNA-capping machinery in members of the dsRNA virus family Reoviridae are RNA-directed RNA polymerase (named VP1 in orbiviruses and rota viruses, and \u03bb3 in orthoreoviruses) and a multifunctional cap-synthesizing enzyme (named VP4 in orbiviruses, VP3 in rotaviruses and \u03bb2 in orthoreoviruses). Both \u03bb2 and VP4 are composed of four domains that were identified as RTPase, GTase, N7MTase and 2\u2032OMTase, respectively 62, 63 . The spatial arrangement of the different protein domains reflects the time sequence of the enzymatic reactions that are required for mRNA capping following synthesis by the viral polymerase (FIG. 4c) . Although it is unclear how and when RTPase activity occurs, a complete pathway has been proposed in which guanylyl transfer occurs near the base of the pentameric 'turret' (formed by \u03bb2 in orthoreoviruses), followed by N7-methylation and 2\u2032-O-methylation of the mRNA 62 . Therefore, in dsRNA viruses, the sequence of steps in the cap synthesis pathway should remain identical to the sequence in the capping pathway for cellular mRNAs and for DNA viruses such as vaccinia virus, for which the capping machinery is embedded in a multidomain protein complex.",

The enzymatic activity requires Mg 2+ (REFS 63, 86, 87) . However, VP4 does not adopt a typical metal-dependent RTPase fold.

Alphaviruses (ss(+)RNA viruses, such as Semliki Forest virus, sindbis virus and chikungunya virus) synthesize a cap-0 structure through a nonconventional mechanism (FIG. 3b) . The Semliki Forest virus replicase protein nsP1 has N7MTase and GTase activities, the latter still incompletely characterized, and is presumably involved in the capping of viral mRNA after nsP2-mediated cleavage of the \u03b2-\u03b3 phosphate bond at the 5\u2032 end 99, 100 . Although the GTase activity of nsP1 has not been fully demonstrated, GTP leads to the formation of a covalent enzyme-GMP complex, albeit only in the presence of AdoMet 99, 101 . Accordingly, mutagenesis and in vitro assays have also revealed that the MTase catalyses the transfer of a methyl group from AdoMet to the N7 position of GTP before the formation of the covalent m 7 GMP-enzyme complex. The covalent link involves a conserved catalytic histidine residue that is required for the GTase reaction but not for MTase activity. Interestingly, brome mosaic virus replicase protein 1A, bamboo mosaic virus nsp 102 , tobacco mosaic virus P126 (REF. 103) and hepatitis E virus p110 (REF. 104) have properties similar to the N7MTase and GTase of alphaviruses, pointing to a common evolutionary origin for these distantly related viruses of plants and animals. Crystal structures are not yet available for any of these enzymes.",

Cap snatching involves three steps (FIG. 3c) . First, the 5\u2032-methylated cap-1 or cap-2 structure of a host mRNA is bound by a specific site in the viral RdRp (or possibly the N protein 108 ). Then, endonucleolytic cleavage of the cellular mRNA occurs several nucleotides downstream from the cap structure. Finally, this short, capped RNA is used as a primer for the synthesis of viral mRNA by the RdRp. The sequence, length and structure of the mRNA 5\u2032 end that comes with the cap varies from one virus to the other. Most sequences are 15-20 nucleotides long 106,109-112 , but arenaviruses, nairoviruses and thogotoviruses use shorter primers [113] [114] [115] [116] .

The influenza virus polymerase is made of three subunits: PA, PB1 and PB2. A cap-binding domain was found in the central region of the PB2 subunit 118 , and an endonuclease domain at the N terminus of the PA subunit 119, 120 . The structures of both domains shed light on the molecular mechanisms leading to cap snatching (see below). The cap-binding domain has a novel fold, although the mode of m 7 G binding by aromatic stacking is similar to that used in other cap-binding proteins. By contrast, the endonuclease domain of PA has a fold that is characteristic of the two-metal-dependent PD(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily but has the peculiarity of a metal-ligating histidine residue in the active site, conferring Mn 2+ specificity 121 (FIG. 5) .",

The decapping activity of Gag aids in the expression of viral RNA, apparently by producing large amounts of cellular RNA decoys that inhibit the S. cerevisiae enzyme 5\u2032-3\u2032 exoribonuclease 1 (Xrn1) 159 and compete with degradation of viral RNA. How the viral mRNA is recruited by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) complex remains to be elucidated. In the case of the family Poxviridae (double-stranded DNA viruses), the decapping enzyme (D10) increases the turnover of host mRNAs and contributes to the shutdown of host protein expression 160 . Moreover, D10 seems to preferentially degrade m 7 GpppGm 2\u2032-O rather than m 7 GpppAm 2\u2032-O and thereby hydrolyses early-phase viral RNA carrying predominantly m 7 GpppGm 2\u2032-O cap structures 161 . In other words, this viral pathway benefits from having mRNAs (produced by the capping apparatus) that will be recruited by the eIF4E complex, and simultaneously removes the potential competition from cellular mRNAs for ribosome binding. Viral 'cap-snatching' (see main text) also results in this imbalance, favouring expression of viral genes. Finally, several viruses have been reported to interfere with the cellular RNA-trafficking and decoy machinery. First, a single-stranded positive-sense RNA (ss(+)RNA) enterovirus was shown to inhibit the ability of cells to form stress granules by cleaving RAS\u00b7GAP-binding protein (G3BP) family members. The kinetics of poliovirus-induced processing (P)-body disruption correlates with production of viral proteases that induce the degradation of P-body proteins, such as DCP1A and the 3\u2032-deadenylase complex component PAN3. Recently, the ss(+)RNA viruses hepatitis C virus and HIV were also reported to be connected to the cellular decapping machinery and to regulate it (reviewed in REF. 162 ). The recent nucleoprotein (NP) structure and enzymatic assay of Lassa virus (ss(-)RNA; Arenaviridae) revealed a second nuclease 108 , which is probably involved in damping the interferon response 127 , and a dTTPbinding site, which is proposed to be a cap-binding site involved in cap snatching. The idea that the cap-binding site for cap snatching may be in the nucleoprotein rather than the L protein had already been suggested for hantaviruses (ss(-)RNA; Bunyaviridae) 128 . In this model, L and N (as the NP protein is called in hantaviruses) cooperate in the process. Meanwhile, the structure of N from Rift Valley fever virus (also a bunyavirus) 129 does not present any of these features. These data call for caution before extending the assignation of such a function to related nucleoproteins.",

            "text": "Innate immunity and RNA capping Mammalian cells have co-evolved with viruses and have developed several mechanisms to detect a viral infection (such as detecting uncapped or partially capped RNA, VPg-RNA, and so on) and induce an antiviral response in neighbouring cells [130] [131] [132] . This innate immunity is based on a small number of receptors called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which discriminate self from non-self components. Non-self detection depends on the recognition of a limited set of pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are molecules or components that are characteristic of infectious agents, such as viral nucleic acids 133 . The presence of non-self nucleic acids is detected through sensors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize DNA or RNA in intracellular compartments that do not usually contain these molecules. Moreover, several PRRs sense the presence of foreign nucleic acids directly in the cytoplasm -namely, the NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and the retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-like receptors (RLRs) 134 . As host cell RNA is present in the cytosol, PRRs sense uncommon RNA structures that are present in infected cells, such as dsRNA, RNA presenting a 5\u2032-triphosphate, RNA with an incompletely methylated cap structure (cap-0, for mammalian standards) or RNA bearing a protein co valently attached to the 5\u2032 end (such as VPg). The detection of PAMPs by PRRs triggers intracellular signalling events that mainly induce the production of type I interferon (IFN), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the establishment of a cellular antiviral state in order to limit viral propagation 135, 136 (FIG . 6) .",

            "text": "The molecular basis for RNA recognition with and without 5\u2032 end modification and/or overhanging nucleotides was analysed for RIG-I and MDA5. Initial studies indicated that RIG-I specifically recognizes 5\u2032-triphosphate-containing ssRNA 140 . It was later found that RIG-I requires base-paired structures in conjunction with a 5\u2032-triphosphate to trigger an antiviral response 141 . The molecular basis of the specific interaction between the RIG-I CTD and 5\u2032-triphosphate dsRNA was deciphered by a crystallographical study of the CTD in complex with RNA 142 . This study revealed Figure 6 | Sensing of viral RNA by the innate immune system. A virus that infects a cell releases viral RNA into the host cytoplasm or endosomes in one of four forms: RNA protected by a 5\u2032 cap-1 structure (7-methyl-Gppp-2\u2032-O-methyl-NP-RNA, depicted here as m 7 GpppNmp-RNA, in which N is the first transcribed nucleotide and p is a phosphate group), 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA (pppNp-RNA), RNA linked to VPg or RNA carrying a 5\u2032 cap-0 structure (m 7 GpppNp-RNA). Cap-1 RNA is recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-like receptors (RLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), which in this case recognize, for example, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). In absence of a cap structure, the 5\u2032-triphosphate of RNA is sensed by the RLR RIG-I, and the VPg-RNA and cap-0 RNA are recognized by another RLR, MDA5. Both RIG-I and MDA5 recruit the mitochondrial-anchored protein interferon-\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2) promoter stimulator 1 (IPS1), which in turn recruits appropriate inhibitor of NF-\u03baB kinase (IKK) proteins to activate nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and IFN regulatory factors (IRFs). This results in the induction of type I IFNs and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1). The endosomal receptor TLR7 can recognize cap-0 RNA and 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA, whereas TLR8 recognizes only 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA. TLR7 recruits the adaptor protein MYD88 through a Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR)-TIR domain interaction, leading to the activation of NF-\u03baB and IRF3 or IRF7; this results in the induction of type I IFNs and the production of IL-1 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Antiviral restriction factors are also stimulated by type I IFN receptor (IFNR) and are known to inhibit the replication of RNA viruses carrying non-capped genomes. Autocrine and paracrine IFN binds IFNR and initiates the JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription) signalling cascade. Among hundreds of proteins encoded by IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), some antiviral proteins specifically target uncapped viral RNA. The IFIT (IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats) proteins specifically sequester 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA (IFIT1) or cap-0 RNA (IFIT2). Protein kinase, RNA activated (PKR) recognizes 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA through an amino-terminal dsRNA-binding domain composed of two binding motifs. Activated PKR phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) through its kinase domain and blocks protein translation. RNase L is stimulated by 2\u2032,5\u2032oligo(A) oligonucleotides synthesized by oligoadenylyl synthases (OASs) and is also involved in the degradation of capped and non-capped viral RNA.",
