This pathway known also as mitochondrial pathway involves pro and anti-apoptotic members of the proteins bcl-2 family which can be a key to trigger mitochondrial apoptosis (Hildeman et al., 2002) . Both pathways, extrinsic and intrinsic, converge at the activation of executioner caspases (caspase-3, -6 and -7), which are responsible for the characteristic morphological changes of apoptosis (Budihardjo et al., 1999; Elmore, 2007) . Generally, both death receptor and mitochondrial apoptosis signalling pathways were shown to be implicated in apoptosis induced by viruses. Induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis has been observed during infection by other coronaviruses, including transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (Eleouet et al., 1998) , avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (Liu et al., 2001) , human coronavirus strain 229E (Collins, 2002) , and equine coronavirus (Suzuki et al., 2008) .",

The aim of this study was to provide a better characterization of the pattern of caspase activation following infection with CCoV-II. We showed that CCoV infection results in the activation of the initiator caspases, caspase-8 and -9, and of the effector caspases, caspase-3 and -6. The data demonstrated that both death receptor and mitochondrial pathways can play an essential role in CCoVinduced apoptosis. Furthermore we observed no variation of CCoV release inhibiting apoptosis by caspase inhibitors.",

Then, the active form of bid translocates to the mitochondria, and triggers bax activation in correlation with the translocation of bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria. These events result in the cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytosol (Korsmeyer et al., 2000; Roucou et al., 2002) . Because CCoV-II infection, as shown above, induced caspase-8 activation in infected cells, we generated subcellular fractions to examine bid and cytochrome c cell localization. As shown in Fig. 7a and b, the full-length bid expression level evaluated by Western blot analysis in cytosolic fraction, decreased in time-dependent in virusinfected cells respect to mock-infected cells. The mitochondrial localization of 15 kDa fragment truncated bid (tbid) clearly appeared at 12 h p.i. Since this fragment contains the BH3 domain which is the functional part of bid for cytochrome c release, we examined whether the bid translocation was accompanied by a mitochondrial release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. The relationships with bid-induced cytochrome c release are evident in Fig. 7c and d which shows the presence of cytochrome c in the cytosolic fraction from 12 h p.i. until the end of infection.",

One of the main advantages of apoptotic cell death for virus infectivity is to facilitate the spread of virus progeny to the neighboring cells and to minimize the inflammatory reaction evoked by virus-infected cells on the host (O'Brien, 1998; Shen and Shenk, 1995) . Coronaviruses are known to infect host cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis and some of them to cause cell-cell fusion during the late stages of infection, resulting in synctium formation and CPE (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . Apoptosis was observed in Vero E6 cells infected by SARS-CoV (Yan et al., 2004) and in a recent publication it has been reported that CCoV induces apoptosis in cultured cells (Ruggieri et al., 2007) . It has been shown that in other coronavirus, e.g., avian infectious bronchitis virus (Liu et al., 2001) , swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Eleouet et al., 2000) and murine coronavirus (Liu et al., 2006; Liu and Zhang, 2007) , apoptosis is induced by a caspase-dependent mechanism.",

First, we examined by MTT assay and morphological evaluations the CCoV-II infection, demonstrating a doseand time-dependent trend of the apoptotic process virusinduced. Then, in an attempt to understand the mechanism of induction of apoptosis in CCoV-II-infected cells we have investigated the caspase pathways. The results reported herein by FLICA method (Bedner et al., 2000) provide an unequivocal evidence that CCoV-II induces apoptotic cell death in vitro, involving caspase-dependent pathway of caspase-8 (death receptor-mediated) and caspase-9 (mitochondrial-mediated). This suggests that both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in the CCoV-II-induced apoptosis were involved. Our results match those Eleouet et al. (2000) who demonstrated that the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), also included in group 1 coronaviruses as CCoV-II, triggers caspase activation events, involving both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, during infection. Further apoptosis-associated caspase activation has been documented also in other coronavirus groups such as SARS-CoV (group 2) (Mizutani et al., 2004) , MHV (group 2) (Chen and Makino, 2002) , and IBV (group 3) (Liu et al., 2001) .",

Therefore, the bcl-2 family of proteins have been considered as pivotal players in apoptosis. Our study has shown that CCoV-II infection down-regulated bcl-2 but up-regulated bax expression. Furthermore, densitometric analysis of bim, which is one of the candidates for initial mitochondrial activation, indicated a marked increase of protein expression level up to 36 h p.i. Bim activates bax through interactions with mcl-1 and bcl-2 (Willis et al., 2007) . Here we have reported that bim significantly shifted the relative contributions of bax to cell death. Then, in response to apoptotic stimuli, bax has to translocate to mitochondria before it can oligomerize and form pores (Desagher and Martinou, 2000) , and the relative decline in bcl-2 expression permits bax to gain dominance, the downstream effects of which most likely involve both direct and indirect activation of the cell death proteases that represent the final steps in the apoptotic pathway.",
