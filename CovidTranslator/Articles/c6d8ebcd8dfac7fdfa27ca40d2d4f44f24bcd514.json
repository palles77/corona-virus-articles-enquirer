Differently from previous studies, we introduce a heterogeneous infection rate to characterize the effect of nodes' local properties, such as population density, individual health habits, and social conditions, on epidemic infectivity. By means of a mean-field approach and Monte Carlo simulations, we explore how the heterogeneity of the infection rate affects the epidemic dynamics, and find that large fluctuations of the infection rate have a profound impact on the epidemic threshold as well as the temporal behavior of the prevalence above the epidemic threshold. This work can refine our understanding of epidemic spreading in metapopulation networks with the effect of nodes' local properties.",

In most studies, the substrate network is represented as a static network where each node stands for a single individual and edges between individuals are fixed. The remarkable result is that the epidemic threshold is a positive value in homogeneous networks such as regular lattices and random networks, but tends to zero in a wide range of scale-free (SF) networks [9] . On the other hand, some other studies investigated epidemic spreading in the dynamical network model with the assumption that all mobile agents have the same action radius and move randomly on a plane satisfying periodic boundary conditions [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The mobility of individuals has been proved to have a significant impact on the epidemic behavior. For example, Buscarino et al. studied disease spreading in a system of random walkers which additionally perform long-distance jumps, and found that a small percentage of jumps in the agent motion are sufficient to produce a large drop in the epidemic threshold [21] .",

In these models, the social network is characterized by the metapopulation network where each node represents a city (subpopulation) consisting of any number of individuals and links denote transportation routes among cities. The individuals' reaction (infection) process occurs within nodes and the diffusion (mobility) process happens among nodes. In the diffusion process, some infected individuals as carriers of a disease may infect previously unaffected nodes. The network topology and diffusion pattern are two key factors in understanding such an epidemic spreading [25, 26, 29] . More recently, people have begun to pay much attention to how the nodes' local properties, such as heterogeneous length of stay of hosts' movements [31] , city-size heterogeneity [32] , local population structure [33] and local epidemic curing rate [34] , affect the metapopulation epidemic dynamics.",

In reality, at different subpopulations, human disease infectivity may possess discrepancies because of social, geographical or cultural aspects. It has been shown that the location-specific factor induces the substantial variation of disease incidence between populations [35, 36] , and the impact of the epidemic in European countries is highly different because of the marked differences in the sociodemographic structure of European populations [37] . In the present work, we introduce a heterogeneous infection rate to characterize the effect of the distinctive nodes' local properties, such as population density, individual health habit, and social conditions, on epidemic infectivity, and study its impact on the metapopulation epidemic dynamics. By using a mean-field (MF) approach and Monte Carlo simulations, it is shown that the heterogeneity of the infection rate has a significant impact on the epidemic threshold as well as the temporal behavior of the prevalence above the epidemic threshold. Note that some related works studied epidemic dynamics on Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) networks with other heterogeneous infection rates across links that are proportional to the intensity of interactions between people [38, 39] .",

The RD process on this network is described as follows.

Here, the local infection rate for nodes with degree k is defined as where \u27e8k \u03b1 \u27e9 = \ued71 k k \u03b1 P(k). In Eq.

(2): negative-correlation infection regime (NIR) (i.e., the case of \u03b1 < 0) and positive-correlation infection regime (PIR) (i.e., the case of \u03b1 > 0). For NIR, the infection rate is negatively related to the node degree. That is to say, the infection rate in nodes with higher degree is smaller than that in nodes with lower degree. This may be understood as follows. Individuals in well-connected central cities (i.e., nodes with higher degree) generally have better health habits, such as washing hands and wearing masks, and have more opportunities for vaccinations than those in peripheral locations (i.e., nodes with lower degree) when an epidemic breaks out. Conversely, for PIR, the infection rate is positively related to the node degree. That is, central cities have a larger infection rate compared with peripheral locations. This can be explained by the fact that central cities generally have a higher population density leading to closer distance and stronger interaction among individuals [41] . This in some sense means that a susceptible individual can be infected with higher probability when it contacts with an infected individual. In the special case of \u03b1 = 0, we have a homogeneous infection rate \u03b2 k = \u03b2 that has been considered in the previous studies [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] .",

More specifically, at the early time steps, the epidemic prevalence in the PIR infection regime grows faster than that in the NIR infection regime. However, as time goes on, it is just the opposite. As a result, after a long time, the two infection regimes make epidemic spreading reach a same equilibrium state. Similarly, in the NIR infection regime, epidemic has a faster speed at the early time steps and reaches the infection peak earlier than that in the NIR infection regime (see the inset of Fig. 4) .",

(2), in nodes with higher degree, the infection rates are larger in the PIR infection regime than those in the NIR infection regime. In nodes with lower degree, it is just the opposite. On the other hand, as a result of the stochastic migration process, most individuals will gather in nodes with higher degree, and this is convenient for epidemic invasion in those nodes. In such cases, epidemic speed in the PIR infection regime is larger than that in the NIR infection regime at early time steps due to the fact that infection mainly occurs in nodes with higher degree. As time goes on, the epidemic diffuses to nodes with lower degree. From this time, epidemic speed in the NIR infection regime begins to increase because of larger infection rates in those nodes with lower degree.",

The network link weight is ignored and the cumulative degree distribution is shown in Fig. 5 . The simulation results about the epidemic threshold and the temporal behavior of the prevalence above the epidemic threshold in the US air transportation network are shown in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. It can be seen from these two figures that the simulation results are also in accord with theoretical results obtained in Section 3. The theoretical and simulated results above are based on the two special mobility patterns. To understand how the heterogeneous infection rate affects the epidemic threshold in a more general mobility pattern, we give the simulation results about the epidemic threshold with D s = 0.5 and D I = 0.8 in the configuration network ( Fig. 8(a) ) and the US airport transportation network (Fig. 8(b) ). It can be seen from Fig. 8 that for a more general mobility pattern, the NIR infection regime increases the epidemic threshold and the PIR infection regime decreases it, which are similar to the results in the special case of D s = D I = 1.",

By a MF approach and Monte Carlo simulations, the impact of these two infection regimes on epidemic dynamics has been studied in heterogeneous metapopulation networks with individuals diffusing randomly. Interesting results have been found as follows. In the case that the susceptible individuals cannot move and the infected individuals always move (i.e., Case 1 mobility pattern), NIR and PIR infection regimes produce the same impact on the epidemic threshold, i.e., increasing the epidemic threshold by the same extent. However, when both the susceptible and infected individuals always move (i.e., Case 2 mobility pattern), the PIR infection regime decreases the threshold and NIR increases it. Furthermore, we have also provided some simulations of the temporal behavior of the prevalence above the epidemic threshold in the Case 1 mobility pattern. It is shown that, compared with the NIR infection regime, the PIR infection regime favors the epidemic invasion at early time steps, but in the long-time limit, these two infection regimes have the same impact on the final epidemic prevalence.",
