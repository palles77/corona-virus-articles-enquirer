            "text": "Human embryo lung cellular protein interacting with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus nonstructural protein-10 (HEPIS) is a novel transcriptional repressor, the expression profile and promoter activity of which have not been well studied. In the present study, in situ hybridization of RNA was used to study differential HEPIS expression levels in different types of cancer and normal tissues. A total of six truncated lengths of the HEPIS promoter regulatory sequences were cloned into the pGL3-basic vector, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and dual luciferase reporter assays were performed. The results of RT-qPCR demonstrated that HEPIS expression levels differed across four breast cancer cell lines. The results of the dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that the activities of the reporter gene fragments spanning -1334/+373, -1203/+373, -1060/+373 and -899/+373 bp were higher compared with the reporter gene fragments spanning -759/+373 and -279/+373 bp. A search of the transcription factor database TRANSFAC identified numerous octamer transcription factor-1 (OCT-1), nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB and C-JUN transcription factor binding sites located on the HEPIS promoter (pHEPIS). Furthermore, the results revealed that mutations of the OCT-1 (-1236/-1223 bp), NF-\u03baB (-1186/-1176 bp) and C-JUN (-856/-846 bp) sites on the human pHEPIS resulted in a decrease in luciferase activity. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that OCT-1, NF-\u03baB and C-JUN bound to pHEPIS in a site-dependent manner at the basal state. The TRANSFAC database was used to analyze the pHEPIS of multiple species and several activator protein-1, NF-\u03baB and OCT-1 transcription factor binding sites were predicted. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that HEPIS is expressed at different levels in multiple organs and breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, these findings indicate that OCT-1, NF-\u03baB and C-JUN transcription factors are associated with transcriptional regulation of the HEPIS gene.",

The HEPIS protein is able to interact with SARS-CoV nsp-10 (1). SARS-CoV nsp-10 is produced by the coronavirus main protease, which cleaves polyproteins pp1a-pp1ab during infection; this protein is able to function as a viral transcriptase (2) . The HEPIS protein consists of 147 amino acids and has several casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (1) . In a previous study, HEPIS was demonstrated to interact specifically with the TATA sequence of the heat shock protein 70 promoter, suggesting that HEPIS may be associated with gene transcriptional regulation (1) . However, the expression profile and promoter activity of HEPIS are yet to be elucidated.",

Octamer transcription factor-1 (OCT-1), nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) are important transcription factors that serve roles in cancer cell proliferation, survival, transformation, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis and chemotherapy/radiotherapy resistance (4) . OCTs are a class of transcription factor that bind to the 'ATTTGCAT' sequence of the gene promoter (5) . OCT-1 (also termed POU2F1) is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor containing a POU domain with a homeobox subdomain (6) . OCT-1 serves an important regulatory role in cellular transcription via binding to a specific promoter octamer sequence on the target genes (7) . Furthermore, OCT-1 binds to cofactors that interact with the POU DNA-binding domain to either positively or negatively regulate a variety of genes (8) . Previous studies have reported that OCT-1 affects the occurrence and development of several cancers, including breast cancer (9) , LNCaP prostate cancer (10) , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (11) and colorectal cancer (12) . NF-\u03baB is a dimeric transcription factor that belongs to the Rel/NF-\u03baB family and is formed by hetero-or homodimerization (13) . NF-\u03baB is known to serve a vital role in the regulation of inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation and apoptosis (13) (14) (15) (16) . AP-1, which is a dimeric transcriptional activator composed of Jun, Fos, activating transcription factor and musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma protein subunits (17, 18) , serves important roles in the regulation of cellular proliferation, transformation, differentiation and apoptosis via binding to a common AP-1-binding site in the target gene promoter (19, 20) .",

HEPIS was positively expressed in tumor and normal tissues from the stomach, liver, colon, prostate, lung, uterine cervix and pancreas (Table I ). The expression of HEPIS was positive in some tumor and normal tissues of the kidneys and ovaries and negative in others. HEPIS was positively expressed in nonspecific infiltrating duct carcinoma of the breast and partial positive expression was observed in normal breast tissue. HEPIS expression levels in four human breast cancer cell lines was examined using RT-qPCR (Fig. 2) . The expression of HEPIS was significantly increased in the osteolytic breast cancer T-47D cell line compared with ZR-75-30, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. HEPIS mRNA levels in T-47D cells were ~8-fold higher compared with MCF-7 cells (P<0.01), and in ZR-75-30, MDA-MB-231 cells were ~1.8-fold higher compared with MCF-7 cells (P<0.05).

HEPIS is also able to inhibit the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and may function as a factor of transcriptional repression (1) . The aim of the present study was to determine the expression profile of the HEPIS gene and further elucidate the mechanism by which HEPIS transcriptional levels differ. RNA in situ hybridization (RISH) is a method of identifying the mRNA transcriptional expression pattern within the cytoplasm by hybridizing the sequence of interest to a labeled probe (24) . Probes include radioactive probes and non-radioactive probes and RISH experiments performed with non-radioactive probes have several advantages over the radioactive procedures, including signal resolution, safety, shelf-life and cost (25) . Due to the limited availability of the HEPIS antibody, the expression of the HEPIS gene in cancer and adjacent normal tissues in 12 organs was assessed using RNA in situ hybridization with a specific digoxigenin-labelled probe. However, due to the limited number of specimens available, it was necessary to further increase the number of specimens analyzed in order to obtain accurate results. HEPIS expression levels in four human breast cancer cell lines was examined using RT-qPCR, however, HEPIS expression in other types of cell lines remains unknown. Determining the differential expression of HEPIS allows analysis of its function in a variety of diseases. Promoters control gene transcription. They may be located upstream of the gene transcription start site and can be very long (26) . The binding of transcription factors to a promoter is an important mechanism by which gene expression is controlled (26) . Investigating HEPIS promoter activity revealed that the luciferase activity varied between pHEPIS-1.3k and pHEPIS-1.1k, suggesting that transcriptional regulation occurs at the-899/-759 bp region of the promoter. Furthermore, the results suggest that mutations of C-JUN (TTG AGT CAGG, -856/-846 bp), OCT-1 (CTA TTT GCT TCTG, -1236/-1223 bp) and NF-\u03baB (GGA ATC CCCT, -1186/-1176 bp) result in a marked reduction in luciferase activity, which indicated that C-JUN, OCT-1 and NF-\u03baB are activators. However, no significant changes in luciferase activity were observed following truncation of the -1334/1203 bp and -1203/-1060 bp regions. These results suggest that the -1334/1203 bp and -1203/-1060 bp regions also contain repressor-binding sites. The findings of the present study indicate that the apparent changes in transcriptional activity of the HEPIS gene may result from complex interactions of different transcription factors with the promoter. The association of HEPIS gene and the above transcription factors maybe widespread and therefore, further study is required.",

These findings provide further insight into the expression profile and the mechanism of HEPIS gene transcriptional regulation.",
