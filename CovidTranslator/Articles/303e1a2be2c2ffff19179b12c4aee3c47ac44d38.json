The most common viral cause is the Rhinovirus (10%-25%). Usually, patients recover in 7 to 10 days. Complications are usually related to extension of infection to the lower respiratory tract (eg, bronchitis, pneumonia) or nasal ostia and eustachian tubes (eg, sinusitis, otitis media). Usual care is mainly symptomatic and supportive. The most commonly known or marketed natural supplements are described in this article. However, health professionals should know that herbalists and natural health care providers most often use a combination of herbs, supplement, aromatherapy, and so forth. to treat symptoms or for their antimicrobial properties.

He followed that by conducting several meta-analyses demonstrating a decrease in the incidence and in the number of days of illness following the use of vitamin C. Since then, controversy has arisen with several trials reporting a benefit (mainly in populations who had low vitamin C intake or < physical stress) and others reporting no benefit. Initial reviews indicated that despite the heterogeneity of the studies, supplementation with vitamin C at doses of 1 g/d or more consistently decreased the duration or alleviated the symptoms of the common cold. 11, 12 In 2007, a meta-analysis by the Cochrane review group 13 attempted to answer the question: does vitamin C in doses of 0.2 g daily or more, reduce the incidence, duration, or severity of the common cold when used either as continuous prophylaxis or at the onset of cold symptoms.",

The exact mechanism of action for the immune-stimulating effects of Echinacea preparations remains unclear. Four compounds are believed to contribute to the immunomodulatory activity of Echinacea extracts: alkamides, glycoproteins, polysaccharides, and caffeic acid derivatives. These seem to activate the alternate complement pathway components, and increased levels of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. 14 In addition, Echinacea extracts increase the macrophage proliferation and phagocytosis, as well as secretion of interferon, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-1 (in vitro and in vivo). [15] [16] [17] A Cochrane Review identified 9 trials (N 5 1126) with a total of 10 Echinacea groups diagnosed with common cold symptoms, randomized and treated with Echinacea. 18 Pressed juices (stabilized with alcohol), alcohol tinctures, or tablets made from dried extracts were the forms of Echinacea used. Outcome measurements were heterogeneous. Treatment groups often used different instruments, timing of measurements, type of analysis, and descriptive statistics. Among the 2 trials with no comparison groups, 1 study among children receiving pressed juice of E purpurea herb reported positive results. 19 When Echinacea preparations were compared with placebo as treatment, a significant effect was reported in 9 comparisons, a trend in 1, and no difference in 6.

Antibiotics should be reserved for patients with bacterial symptoms. Surveys indicate that 24% to 32% of subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis use herbal therapy either alone or in combination with other treatments. 30 Allergic rhinitis is a common condition. Current estimates indicate that more than 50 million people in the United States suffer from allergic rhinitis. It is the most prevalent chronic condition in patients less than 18 years of age. People affected by the condition often report fatigue and upper respiratory symptoms. Allergic rhinitis also leads to 40% to 80% of cases of chronic rhinosinusitis. 31 In this section, the most common natural supplements marketed for the treatment of rhinosinusitis are reviewed.",

Three systematic reviews of herbal therapies for asthma were conducted in the last decade, and although they used slightly different methodologies, they all came to similar conclusions. In the most recent and most comprehensive review, 65 the investigators found 27 studies assessing 21 herbal preparations involving 1925 participants that met the entry criteria of the review. Small sample sizes, disparate outcome measurements, and relatively short-term follow-up prevented any overall clear conclusion as to efficacy and long-term safety of herbal therapy for asthma. Mean duration of therapy was only 8 weeks. There were large variations in the types of pulmonary function measurements, symptom scores, and types of subjective assessments, greatly limiting the ability of the review to perform combined outcome data assessments or subgroup analysis. With these limitations in mind, the results of a few herbs merit comment.",

            "text": "Given the known influence of inflammatory mediators on asthma, fish oil supplementation has naturally been a topic of significant interest for treatment and prevention of asthma, because of the known antiinflammatory effects of omega-3 fatty acids present in fish oil. Epidemiology studies have shown that populations (such as Eskimo communities) with diets high in fish have low rates of asthma, and as diets in other communities have become higher in saturated fats, asthma incidence has increased. 81 Two very small double-blind RCTs of only 10 and 16 patients with exercise-induced asthma using fish oil capsules containing 3.2 g of eicosapentaenoic acid and 2.0 g of docohexaenoic acid daily for 3 weeks demonstrated clinical improvement in pulmonary function response to exercise, decreased bronchodilator use, and decreased sputum inflammatory mediators. 82, 83 However, a Cochrane Systematic Review in 2002 81 failed to demonstrate any clinical benefit of the use of n-3 marine fatty acids supplementation for asthma. In the comprehensive review, the investigators identified 9 studies that met study inclusion criteria, and found no convincing evidence that supplementation of diet with marine n-3 fatty acids leads to an improvement in asthma symptoms, asthma medication usage, bronchial hyper-reactivity or FEV 1 , nor was there evidence of risk or adverse effects identified. They concluded with 2 interesting caveats: first, that the studies concentrated mainly on supplementation of marine n-3 fatty acids rather than eating more fish per se, and that perhaps there are other elements in the original food source that could have beneficial effects for asthma; second, that much of the interest in n-3 fatty acid supplementation for asthma began in the era when the neutrophil was considered to possibly have an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma, because the most profound antiinflammatory effects of n-3 fatty acids are on neutrophil function and mediator generation. However, eosinophils and mast cells are now believed to be more important effector cells in asthma, and therefore this may explain their relative lack of efficacy, given that n-3 fatty acids lack significant antiinflammatory effect on eosinophils and mast cells in vitro.",

Martin and colleagues 88 searched for all RCTs since 1970 that compared acupuncture at real and placebo points and used at least 1 objective measurement of pulmonary function. They took estimates from the 11 trials that met inclusion criteria, and combined estimated standardized mean differences between acupuncture and placebo to estimate the overall effect. The Cochrane Systematic Review 87 was only able to pool data for 2 outcomes (PEFR and global assessment of well-being) in the 12 RCTs involving 350 patients that met their criteria.

(2) As with herbal medications, study quality, sample size, missing information, and heterogeneity in measurements limited data pooling and the ability to draw useful, statistically significant conclusions. (3) Reviewers commented in particular about the challenge unique to acupuncture research in choosing appropriate placebo acupuncture points, noting that studies varied in choosing nonmeridian points versus nonindicated but legitimate acupuncture points for placebo control. The points used in the sham arm of some studies were used for the treatment of asthma in others (according to TCM). Further heterogeneity occurs with needle depth, duration of insertion, choice of laser versus needle, and the choice of either standardized points versus allowing treating providers to individualize and customize points depending on diagnoses made using a TCM nosology quite foreign to western physicians and research methods. They concluded with clear recommendations for larger studies with particular attention to the nature of sham/ control points and including a no-treatment control arm in addition to sham groups, as well as the need for studies to include patients with more severe asthma.",

A well-designed double-blind RCT of 92 moderately severe (FEV 1 50%-65%) COPD patients in Israel demonstrated that 100 mg of ginseng extract capsules twice daily for 3 months resulted in significant improvement in all parameters of pulmonary function testing, including maximum voluntary ventilation, maximum inspiratory volume and VO 2 max with no observed side effects. 103 The improvement in airflow in major and peripheral airways as well as improvement in exercise capacity parallels previous studies on athletes. This was interpreted by the investigators as indications of positive effects on respiratory muscle strength possibly caused by postulated neurotransmitter-like actions. Another very small Chinese study of 20 patients using a daily intravenous formulation of 3 herbs with Panax ginseng as the main ingredient for 14 days also showed improvements in pulmonary function (FEV 1 and vital capacity) as well as 6-minute walk time and Borg symptom scores. 104 In general, animal studies indicate that ginseng has very few toxic effects for either acute or chronic (up to 2 years) use, but some in vitro studies show that Panax ginseng may inhibit the aggregation of platelets, reduce platelet adhesiveness, reduce internationalized normalized ratio (INR), and reduce warfarin concentrations and increase its clearance.",

No mention was made in the article about adverse effects in any of the study arms. Concerns expressed by subsequent letter responses challenged the use of nonstandard allopathic medications as control, pointing out that the combination of oral salmeterol and theophylline poses known cardiovascular risks to COPD patients, and expressed concern about the issue of heavy metal poisoning associated with plant-based Ayurvedic medicines. Drosera species have been used for hundreds of years for respiratory tract problems, and it is a fairly commonly used medicine as a solitary ingredient or as part of combination medications in roughly 200 to 300 registered medications. Testing of individual Drosera constituents reveals antiinflammatory, antispasmodic, and antibacterial effects, with minimal adverse effects although safety data are limited. Although purported to have some evidence of antitumor and antiinflammatory effects, Bryonia has been rated as unsafe with serious gastrointestinal, renal, and neurologic adverse effects reported. Ipecac is well known in the United States from its previously recommended role as an emetic in cases of suspected pediatric poisoning. That recommendation was rescinded several years ago, and there have been reports of myopathies and death with chronic use. 68,70 Although this is a promising and interesting study done with reasonable methodology, further study is clearly needed regarding the efficacy, safety, and adverse effects of the individual herbal ingredients.",

Using meta-analysis, they found no evidence that simple nutritional supplementation confers benefit to patients with COPD in terms of clinical outcomes including measuring effects on anthropometric, functional exercise, pulmonary mechanics, peripheral muscle function, and health-related quality of life derived from validated scales. Triceps skinfold thickness was marginally higher with supplementation than control, but was not associated with any other meaningful health improvements, suggesting that some fat was deposited in the patients receiving nutritional supplementation but this change does not constitute a worthwhile response to therapy. However, it is worth noting that 2 weeks may be a short period of supplementation.",

Researchers at the Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine performed a well-designed, double-blind, RCT of a single session of multitechnique OMT versus sham therapy in 35 patients more than 65 years of age, looking for evidence of immediate measurable changes in pulmonary function. They did find statistically significant evidence of pulmonary function change, but in the wrong direction: OMT-treated patients had worsening of residual volume, indicating more air trapping, and a decrease in forced expiratory flow. The investigators concluded that further study looking at the effect of individual techniques and studying longer-term pulmonary function responses to OMT will be important to understand if COPD should be a contraindication to the use of this therapy.",
