However, the functional domain of Ov-ASP-1 as an adjuvant is not clearly defined. Based on the structural prediction of this protein family, we constructed a 16-kDa recombinant protein of Ov-ASP-1 that contains only the core pathogenesis-related-1 (PR-1) domain (residues 10-153), designated ASPPR. We found that ASPPR exhibits adjuvanticity similar to that of the full-length Ov-ASP-1 (residues 10-220) for various antigens, including ovalbumin (OVA), HBsAg protein antigen, and the HIV peptide 5 (Pep5) antigen, but it is more suitable for vaccine design in ASPPR-antigen fusion proteins, and more stable in PBS than Ov-ASP-1 stored at \u221270 \u2022 C. These results suggest that ASPPR might be the functional region of Ov-ASP-1 as an adjuvant, and therefore could be developed as an adjuvant for human use.",

As a widely used adjuvant, alum can induce good Th2-associated antibody response, but it has little capacity to stimulate strong cellular immune responses, and it is not effective for peptide antigens [5, 6] . Oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants, such as MF59, AS03 and AF03 as well as AS04 are used in vaccine formulations against influenza virus or HPV and HBV, respectively. They are able to permit dose reduction and induce longer duration of antibody responses, and could not enhance the immunogenicity of peptide antigens [7] [8] [9] . The AS03 adjuvant has recently undergone an increased scrutiny because of the adverse reactions, including increased risk of narcolepsy, induced in children, adolescents and young people [10] . Accordingly, new generations of adjuvants, which are capable of safely inducing both humoral and cellular immune response with proper magnitude, breadth and potency are needed for the vaccine development of future subunit vaccines [1] .",

The innate adjuvants include the TLR4 ligand MPL [12] , the TLR3 ligand poly (I:C) [13] , the TLR5 ligand Flagellin [14, 15] CpG ODN [16] . Apart from these immunostimulatory molecules, several helminth-proteins were reported to have adjuvant effects when used with different vaccine models; however, most of them induced Th2-type immune responses [17] [18] [19] . Our previous studies have shown that a 22-kDa protein named activation-associated secreted protein-1 (Ov-ASP-1) from Onchocerca volvulus is a potent adjuvant for various vaccine antigens, including synthetic peptidebased antigens [20] [21] [22] [23] . Importantly, Ov-ASP-1 can be formulated with a vaccine antigen either in aqueous admixtures or as a fusion protein. The attributes of Ov-ASP-1 adjuvant include: (i) easy formulation; (ii) enables reduction in dosage of the vaccine antigen; (iii) has the capacity to accelerate and enhance antibody responses against the target vaccine antigens; (iv) able to elicit mixed Th1/Th2 with Th1-biased antibody responses and cellular immune responses against some antigens; (v) elicits a balanced immune responses against various vaccines; and (vi) augments recall responses to the vaccine antigens [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Ov-ASP-1 was shown to bind specifically to human antigen presenting cells (APCs) and to trigger Th1-biased proinflammatory cytokine production in na\u00efve PBMCs, most likely through its ability to activate monocytederived dendritic cells, TLR2 and TLR4 [28] .",

ASPPR not only augmented the IgG antibody responses (Fig. 4A ), but also increased both Th2-associated IgG1 (Fig. 4B) and Th1-associated IgG2a (Fig. 4 C) antibody responses, which reflects a bioactivity profile much different from that of alum. Of note, ASPPR induced significantly higher antibody IgG2a responses than Ov-ASP-1 (P < 0.05) with similar levels of antibody IgG and IgG1. ELISPOT assay revealed that ASPPR as well as Ov-ASP-1 elicited higher production of HBsAg peptide-specific IFN-\u2425 (Fig. 4D ), but ASPPR also induced higher IL-4 (Fig. 4E) responses; whereas, alum stimulated only significantly higher IL-4. Taken together, these results indicated that ASPPR not only augmented protein antigen-induced antibody response, but also enhanced specific cellular immune responses, suggesting that ASPPR retains the adjuvanticity of Ov-ASP-1 for recombinant protein antigen such as HBsAg.",

In particular, safe and nontoxic adjuvants able to stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses for different types of antigens are sought. Our previous studies have shown that Ov-ASP-1 in aqueous formulation with bystander antigens is an efficient adjuvant for several vaccine antigens, including recombinant proteins, synthetic peptides and commercially inactivated vaccines [24] . Moreover, Ov-ASP-1 induced a mixed Th1/Th2 response with a Th1-biased antibody profile against many antigens. However, its functional region is still unknown.

The presented data were representative results from three mice (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article). acid sequences showed that Ov-ASP-1 has a major conserved domain that forms a similar tertiary structure as that published for Na-ASP-2 [29] . Using the crystal structure of Na-ASP-2 as a model, we designed a potential functional fragment, ASPPR, that corresponds to the PR-1 structurally conserved domain and which was successfully expressed in an E. coli system. Further investigation revealed that ASPPR retained the cell binding profile of Ov-ASP-1, but has a higher binding capacity, as demonstrated by its ability to bind to mouse T, B, and NK cells, as well as macrophages. Previously it was shown that Ov-ASP-1 binds mostly to human B cells and monocytes [28] .",

            "text": "Since both ASPPR and Ov-ASP-1 are proteins, they can induce anti-self antibodies in the vaccinated mice, thus raising the question of whether preexisting antibodies against these protein adjuvants may suppress their adjuvanticity when they are used in subsequent vaccine formulations. Our previous study have shown that the antibodies induced against Ov-ASP-1 (1:256,000-1:512,000) had no impact on its ability to induce immune responses against bystander antigens (e.g., the RBD of SARS-CoV spike protein and a commercial influenza virus HA vaccine) when used as an adjuvant in a sequential vaccine. Moreover, we have shown that the anti-Ov-ASP-1 anti-self-antibodies elicited during three immunization of non-human primate are much reduced, thus pointing to the possibility that the level of anti-self-antibodies could be species dependent and presently less of an issue with moving forward to the development of Ov-ASP-1 as an adjuvant [27] . Notably, another protein adjuvant, flagellin, has been used in clinics or clinical trials [36] [37] [38] . To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report to show that the antiflagellin antibodies have significant impact on its adjuvanticity. As a protein-based adjuvant, Ov-ASP-1 can be fused with a protein antigen as a subunit vaccine consisting of both immunogen and adjuvant. Since ASPPR has much shorter sequence than Ov-ASP-1, we believe that ASPPR is more suitable than the full-length of Ov-ASP-1 for construction and expression of the fusion protein-based subunit vaccine.",
