Some worry it could badly hit the developing world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, potentially leading to a global human calamity. It is still early days, but using existing data we develop a large ensemble of ecological niche models that project monthly variation in climate suitability of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus throughout a typical climatological year. The current spread suggests a degree of climate determination with Coronavirus displaying preference for cool and dry conditions. The predecessor SARS-CoV was linked to similar climate conditions. Should the spread of SARS CoV-2 continue to follow current trends, a worst-case scenario of synchronous global pandemic is improbable. More probable is the emergence of asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks much like other respiratory diseases. People in temperate warm and cold climates are more vulnerable. Those in arid climates follow next in vulnerability, while the disease will likely marginally affect the tropics. Our projections minimize uncertainties related with spread of SARS CoV-2, providing critical information for anticipating the adequate social, economic and political responses.",

Projections are obtained from an ensemble of 10 familiar machine learning and statistical ecological niche models 9 , each with 20 copies generated with bootstrapping to account for and enable the quantification of intra-model variability to the initial conditions 10, 11 . Models were trained using the distribution of all recorded SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus cases by the 10/03/2020 with data compiled and made available to the John Hopkins University Mapping 2019-nCoV portal 12 . Regions with fewer than 5 positive cases were not included in the models. Exclusion of such sites was based on the working assumption that sites with small numbers of positive cases are likely imported from infected regions, thus failing to provide evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus is being transmitted locally within its ecological niche. Predictors were temperature and precipitation values expected between January and March using 1979-2013 as reference, and with data downloaded from the high-resolution climatology database for the earth's land surface 13 . Models were then projected monthly for the rest of the year.",

While the pattern of spread is, as it seems based on our analysis, constrained by climate, the actual numbers of positive cases are affected by nonclimatic factors 14 , some of which might be stochastic. Less sensitive measurements can be obtained by using presence absence of positive cases. With such an approach, the estimated interquartile ranges for temperature is -18,10\u00baC to 28,64\u00baC (99% range) and -8,81\u00baC to 25,65\u00baC (95% range). For precipitation it is 1,00 mm to 345,55 mm range (99% range) and 2,16 mm to 151,31 mm (95% range). Regardless of the approach used to quantify the climate envelope of the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus, we are not characterizing the exact local temperature and precipitation conditions constraining the virus spread but rather determining the type of macro-climate conditions in the places where spreading is occurring. Nevertheless, regardless of whether we calculate environmental preferences of the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus using the total numbers of incidences or their presence and absence, it appears the virus favors cool and dry conditions being largely absent under extremely cold and very hot and wet conditions ( Figure 1 ). We summarized projections by ensembles of ecological niche models by climate zones 15 . The analysis reveals that SARS-CoV-2 strives in warm temperate climates between October to May and cold temperate climates between April and September ( Figure 2 ). Arid environments follow the temperate warm trend of seasonal probability of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus but with generally more moderate levels. Much of the tropics have low levels of climate suitability for spread of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus owing to their high temperatures and precipitation (used here as a surrogate for humidity), followed by polar climates, where conditions of extreme cold temperatures seem to be beyond the virus critical minimum tolerance values. In most of such low climate suitability areas, human populations will likely be spared from outbreaks arising from local transmissions ( Figure 2 ).",

We used SDM-R platform 9 for ensemble ecological niche modeling 10 (or species distributions modeling 25 ), to characterize climate conditions associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 between January and March 2020. We used 10 commonly used machine learning methods including generalized linear model (GLM) 26 , generalized additive model (GAM) 27 , classification and regression trees (CART) 28 , boosted regression trees (BRT) 29 , random forests (RF) 30 , multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) 31 , support vector machine (SVM) 32 , multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLP) 33 , maximum entropy (Maxent) 34 , and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) 35 . We used a bootstrapping resampling procedure 36 , with 20 replications, to generate the training and test datasets. We then fitted the ecological niche models for each replication using the training dataset and evaluated them for their performance using the test dataset. We used the area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot and the true skill statistic (TSS) to measure the predictive performance of models 37 . A ROC curve plots sensitivity values (true positive fraction) on the y-axis against '1specificity' values (false positive fraction) for all thresholds on the x-axis. AUC is a threshold-independent metric that varies from 0 to 1 and provides a single measure of model performance. AUC values under 0.5 indicate discrimination worse than chance; a score of 0.5 implies random predictive discrimination; and a score of 1 indicates perfect discrimination. TSS is calculated as \"sensitivity + specificity -1\" and ranges from -1 to +1, where +1 indicates perfect agreement, a value of 0 implies agreement expected by chance, and a value of less than 0 indicates agreement worse than chance. We then used the ensemble of 200 models to calculate and project a consensus distribution of spreading risk for each month across the globe. Consensus was achieved through AUC-weighted mean across all models 38 . .

That is, substitute the familiar analysis of meteorological variation at site levels matched with specific SARS-CoV-2 cases by examination of all known positive cases worldwide against an analysis of large-scale climatological variation. It is, obviously, possible that, as the virus spreads and additional climate regions witness outbreaks of positive cases, inferences made herein are altered. We are skeptical this will happen for two reasons. Firstly, there is little reason to suspect that out-of-China contaminations would have occurred only, or mainly, with trade partners in the northern hemisphere 14 . China is a big world player, having key commercial partnerships with Africa and Latin America. Yet there is not indication that meaningful local infections have taken place in these areas despite the global reporting of Coronavirus cases generally attributed to travellers coming from infected regions.
