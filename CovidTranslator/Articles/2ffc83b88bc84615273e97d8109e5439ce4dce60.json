Reliable estimates can provide key insights into the climatic and biological drivers influencing the diversity or structure of that population and evidence hypotheses concerning its future growth or decline. In infectious disease applications, the individuals infected across an epidemic form the target population. The renewal model estimates the effective reproduction number, R, of the epidemic from counts of its observed cases. The skyline model infers the effective population size, N, underlying a phylogeny of sequences sampled from that epidemic. Practically, R measures ongoing epidemic growth while N informs on historical caseload. While both models solve distinct problems, the reliability of their estimates depends on p-dimensional piecewise-constant functions. If p is misspecified, the model might underfit significant changes or overfit noise and promote a spurious understanding of the epidemic, which might misguide intervention policies or misinform forecasts. Surprisingly, no transparent yet principled approach for optimising p exists. Usually, p is heuristically set, or obscurely controlled via complex algorithms. We present a computable and interpretable p-selection method based on the minimum description length (MDL) formalism of information theory. Unlike many standard model selection techniques, MDL accounts for the additional statistical complexity induced by how parameters interact. As a result, our method optimises p so that R and N estimates properly adapt to the available data. It also outperforms comparable Akaike and Bayesian information criteria on several classification problems. Our approach requires some knowledge of the parameter space and exposes the similarities between renewal and skyline models.",

These algorithms, while capable, are more computationally demanding, and lack interpretability (their results are not easily debugged and linear functions do not possess the biological meaningfulness of constant ones, which estimate the harmonic mean of time-varying population sizes [32] ). Note that we assume phylogenetic data is available without error (i.e. we do not consider extensions of the above or subsequent methods to genealogical uncertainty) and limit the definition of skyline models to those with piecewise-constant functions.

Here we attempt to answer this need by developing and validating a minimum description length (MDL)-based approach that unifies renewal and skyline model selection. MDL is a formalism from information theory that treats model selection as equivalent to finding the best way of compressing observed data (i.e. its shortest description) [35] . MDL is advantageous because it includes both model dimensionality and parametric complexity within its definition of model complexity [36] . Parametric complexity describes how the functional relationship between parameters matters [21] , and is usually ignored by standard selection criteria. However, MDL is generally difficult to compute [10] , which may explain why it has not penetrated the epidemiological or phylodynamics literature.",

This is achieved by recognising that sampled phylogenies and incidence curves both sit within a Poisson point process framework and by capitalising on the piecewise-constant structure of skyline and renewal models. The result is a pair of analogous FIA metrics that lead to adaptive estimates of N (t) and R(s) by selecting the p most justified by the observed Poisson data. These expressions decompose model complexity into clearly interpretable contributions and are as computable as the standard AIC and the Bayesian information criteria (BIC). We find, over a range of selection problems, that the FIA generally outperforms the AIC and BIC, emphasising the importance of including parametric complexity. This improvement requires some knowledge about the piecewise parameter space domain.",

The FI defines the precision i.e. the inverse of the variance around the MLEs, and also (directly) improves with m j . We will find these two quantities to be integral to formulating our approach to pmodel selection. The FI and MLE control the per-segment performance, while p determines how well the overall piecewise function adapts to the underlying generating process. The renewal model is based on the classic (Lotka-Euler) renewal equation or branching process approach to epidemic transmission [42] . This states that the number of new infecteds depends on past incidence through the generation time distribution, and the effective reproduction number R(s). As incidence is usually observed on a coarse temporal scale (e.g. days or weeks), exact infection times are not available. As a result, incidence data conform to a Poisson histogram record with the number of infecteds observed in the s th bin denoted I(s). For simplicity we assume daily bins. The generation time distribution is specified by w(u), the probability that an infected takes between u \u2212 1 and u days to transmit that infection [7] .",

Using results from [28] , we find the square root transform of R to be robust for renewal models i.e. it guarantees optimal estimation properties. We compute the FI under this parametrisation to reveal that the total infectiousness controls the precision around our MLEs (via \u03bb j ). This will also improve as m j increases, but with the caveat that the parameters underlying bigger epidemics (specified by larger historical incidence values, and controlled through \u039b(s)) are easier to estimate than those of smaller ones. In both models we therefore find a clear piecewise separation of MLEs and FIs. Per-segment bias and precision depend on the quantity of data apportioned to each parameter. This data division is controlled by p, which balances persegment performance against the overall fit of the model to its generating process. Thus, model dimensionality fundamentally controls inference quality. Large p means more segments, which can adapt to rapid N (t) or R(s) changes. However, this also rarefies the per-segment data (grouped sums like \u03bb j or m j decrease) with both models becoming unidentifiable if p > m. Small p improves segment inference, but stiffens the model. We next explore information theoretic p-selection methods that formally utilise these MLEs and FIs in their decision making.",

As observed previously, current approaches to p-selection utilise ad-hoc rules or elaborate algorithms that are difficult to interrogate. Here we emphasise why finding an optimal p, denoted p * , is important and illustrate the pitfalls of inadequately balancing bias and precision. We start by proving that overfitting is a guaranteed consequence of depending solely on the log-likelihood for p-selection. While this may seem obvious, early formulations of piecewise models did over-parametrise by setting p = m [38] and our proof can be applied more generally e.g. when selecting among models with p < m. Substituting the MLEs of Eq. (5) and Eq. (7) into Eq. (4) and Eq. (6), we get Eq. (10).",

Specifically, the AIC simply treats model dimensionality as a proxy for complexity, while the BIC also factors in the total dimension of the available data. A small sample correction to the AIC, which adds a further p+1 /m\u2212p\u22121 to the penalty in Eq. (12) , was used in [38] for skyline models. We found this correction inconsequential to our later simulations and so used the standard AIC only. As discussed in Materials and Methods, these metrics are insufficient descriptions because they ignore parametric complexity. Consequently, we suggested the MDL approximations of Eq. (8) and Eq. (9) . We now derive and specialise these expressions to skyline and renewal models. Adapting the FIA metric of Eq. (8) forms a key result of this work. Its integral term, \u2126 = log det[m \u22121 I(\u03b8)] 1 2 , can, in general, be intractable [36] . However, the piecewise structure of both the skyline and renewal models, which leads to orthogonal (diagonal) FI matrices, allows us to decompose det[m \u22121 I(\u03b8)] m \u22121 I j (\u03b8 j ) with I j (\u03b8 j ) as the j th diagonal element of I(\u03b8), which only depends on \u03b8 j .

For the FIA we set v = 100 as a conservative upper bound on the reproduction number domain. We start by highlighting how the FIA (1) regulates between the over and underfitting extremes from Fig. 2b, and (2) updates its selected p * as the data increase. These points are illustrated in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b . Graphs (i) and (iii) exemplify (1) as the FIA ((iii)) reduces p from the maximum chosen by the log-likelihood ((i)), leading to estimates that balance noise against dimensionality. Interestingly, the FIA chooses a minimum of segments for the sigmoidal fall in Fig. 3b , and so pinpoints its key dynamics. As the observed data are increased (graphs (ii) and (iv) of Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b ) the FIA adapts p to reflect the improved resolution that is now justified, hence demonstrating (2). The increased data use 5 more, conditionally independent (on R(s)) I m 1 curves and has size 6m. The i j and \u03bb j used now sum over every of the I m 1 curves. While the above examples provide practical insight into the merits of the FIA, they cannot rigorously assess its performance, since continuous R(s) functions have no true p = p * or k * = m /p * . We therefore study two problems in which a true p * exists: a simple binary classification, and a more complex piecewise model search. In both, we benchmark the FIA against the AIC, BIC and QK criteria over the same set of simulated I m 1 curves. We note that, when R(s) is piecewiseconstant, increasing the number of conditionally independent curves improves the probability of recovering p * . We discuss the results of the first problem in the Appendix (see Fig. A1 ), where we show that the FIA most accurately identifies between a null model of an uncontrolled epidemic and an alternative model featuring rapid outbreak control. The FIA uniformly outperforms all other metrics at every p * in this problem, with the QK a close second.",

We simulate serially sampled phylogenies with sampled tips spread evenly over some interval using the phylodyn R package of [14] . Increasing the sampling density within that interval increases overall data size m (each pair of sampled tips can produce a coalescent event). We define our p segments as groups of k coalescent events. Skyline model selection is more involved because the end-points of the p segments coincide with coalescent events. While this ensures statistical identifiability, it means that grouping is sensitive to phylogenetic noise [38] , and that p changes for a given k if m varies (m = pk). This can result in MLEs, even at optimal groupings, appearing delayed or biased relative to N (t), when N (t) is not a grouped piecewise function. Methods are currently under development to resolve these biases [25] . Nevertheless, we start by examining how our FIA approach mediates the extremes of Fig. 2a . We restrict our grouping parameter to 4 \u2264 k \u2264 80, set v = 10 3 (max N (t) = 300) and apply the FIA of Eq. (14) to obtain Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b . Two points are immediately visible: (1) the FIA ((iii)-(iv)) regulates the noise from the log-likelihood ((i)-(ii)), and (2) the FIA supports higher p * when the data are increased ((iv)). Specifically, the FIA characterises the bottleneck of Fig. 5b using a minimum of segments but with a delay. As data accumulate, more groups can be justified and so the FIA is able to compensate for the delay. Note that the last 1-2 coalescent events are often truncated, as they can span half the time-scale, and bias all model selection criteria [22] . In the Appendix (see Fig. A4 ) we show how the sensitivity of the FIA to event density compares to other methods on empirical data (see Materials and Methods). We consider two model selection problems involving a piecewise-constant N (t), to formally evaluate the FIA against the QK, BIC and AIC. We slightly abuse notation by redefining m as the number of coalescent events per piecewise segment. The first is a binary hypothesis test between a Kingman coalescent null model [16] and an alternative with a single shift to N (t). We investigate this problem in the Appendix and show in Fig. A2 (i) that the FIA is, on average, better at selecting the true model than other criteria, with the QK a close second. Further, these metrics generally improve in accuracy with increased data. Closer examination also reveals that the FIA and QK have the best overall true positive and lowest false positive rates (Fig. A2(ii) ).",

This is a known issue in common skyline methods that apply smoothing prior distributions for example, where the prior-induced penalty is unclear [20] . Standard metrics, such as the AIC and BIC, are easy to compute and offer transparent penalties; treating model complexity as either equivalent to p or p mediated by the observed data size (see Eq.

We achieved this by setting v to the true R max = 1.5. However, when there is a significant mismatch between v and R max we find that the FIA is notably inferior to the QK and BIC. Fig. A3a illustrates, at v = 100 and 6, how the magnitude of this mismatch influences relative performance. However, this effect is not always important, as seen in Fig. 4b(i) where R max = 6 and \u03bd = 100. The skyline model also has this FIA v-dependence. We re-examine the square wave model selection problem of Fig. 6b , but for v ranging between 10 2 and 10 5 . Fig. A3b plots the resulting changes in the FIA detection probability at N max = 300 ((i)) and 600 ((ii)). There we observe, that while the FIA is sensitive to v, it still performs well over the entire range. Thus, the FIA can sometimes be a choice selection metric, even in the absence of reasonable Fig. 4b (ii) but at different v. The accuracy of the FIA clearly depends on the discrepancy between v and R max = 1.5, and becomes inferior when v is dramatically above this maximum ((i)). In (b) we revisit the simulations of Fig. 6a , but vary v between 10 2 and 10 5 . The AIC, BIC and QK from Fig. 6a are in cyan, while the best and worst case FIA values are in grey.

The MLEs and FIs of the renewal model depend on the \u03bb j and i j groups. As a result, epidemics with low observed incidence (i.e. likely to have i j = 0) and diseases possessing sharp (low variance) generation time distributions (i.e. likely to feature \u03bb j = 0 ) will be difficult to adaptively estimate. Hence, we conditioned on the outbreak not dying out. Similarly, the MLEs and FIs of the skyline are sensitive to m j , meaning that it is necessary to ensure each group has coalescent events falling within its duration. Forcing segment end-points to coincide with coalescent events, as in [6] , guards against this identifiability problem [28] .

It is impossible to infer changes in R(s) on a finer time scale than that of the observed incidence curve or estimate more N (t) segments than the number of available coalescent events [28] .
