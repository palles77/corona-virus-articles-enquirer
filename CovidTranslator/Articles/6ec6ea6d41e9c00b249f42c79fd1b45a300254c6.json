            "text": "Background Pancreatic digestive enzymes present in meconium might be responsible for meconium-induced lung injury. The local Renin Angiotensin System plays an important role in lung injury and inflammation. Particularly, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) has been identified as a protective lung enzyme against the insult. ACE-2 converts pro-apoptotic Angiotensin II to anti-apoptotic Angiotensin 1-7. However, the effect of meconium on ACE-2 has never been studied before. Objective To study the effect of meconium on ACE-2, and whether inhibition of proteolytic enzymes present in the meconium reverses its effects on ACE-2. Methods Alveolar epithelial A549 cells were exposed to F-12 medium, 2.5% meconium, meconium + a protease inhibitor cocktail (PIc) and PIc alone for 16 h. At the end of incubation, apoptosis was measured with a nuclear fragmentation assay and cell lysates were collected for ACE-2 immunoblotting and enzyme activity. Results Meconium caused a fourfold increase in apoptotic nuclei (p < 0.001). The pro-apoptotic effect of meconium can be reversed by PIc. Meconium reduced ACE-2 enzyme activity by cleaving ACE-2 into a fragment detected at ~ 37 kDa by immunoblot. PIc prevented the degradation of ACE-2 and restored 50% of ACE-2 activity (p < 0.05). Conclusion These data suggest that meconium causes degradation of lung protective ACE-2 by proteolytic enzymes present in meconium, since the effects of meconium can be reversed by PIc.",

None of the interventions (oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, and tracheal suctioning) after delivery has proven effective in preventing MAS [1] . Meconium aspiration is characterized by initial obstruction of the airways resulting in ventilation-perfusion mismatch and hypoxemia. Within a few hours of exposure to meconium, a severe inflammatory response in the lungs is initiated [2] . Recent experimental data using animal models have indicated the presence of non-inflammatory cell death, apoptosis, in meconium-contaminated lungs [3] . Still, the potential pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic action of meconium in the pathogenesis of MAS is not well understood.",

            "text": "The role of the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) is well established in neonatal lung injury and inflammation [4] . RAS is thought to be a systemic cascade and plays an important role in fluid balance and blood pressure regulation [5] . However, many studies support the pivotal role of tissue specific RAS in injury and repair [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . A subset of these studies supports the existence of an intrinsic angiotensin system in lung alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and demonstrates that activation of this local angiotensin system plays a major role in lung injury [12] . Angiotensinogen gets converted to Angiotensin I (ANG I) via renin. ANG I is then converted to ANG II by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). ANG II induces apoptosis in AEC's through angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R). In contrast, ANG 1-7 is antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and vasodilatory and acts through the \"Mas receptor.\" The main function of ACE-2 is to convert the octapeptide ANG II to the heptapeptide ANG 1-7, thereby counterbalancing ACE activity [13] .",

This degraded ACE-2 (at ~ 37 kDa) was only found in meconium-treated cells (Fig. 3b) . The degraded ACE-2 at ~ 37 kDa by Western blot has been detected in an LPS-induced rat model of lung injury [20] . We did not observe a statistically significant decrease in intact ACE-2 at ~ 100 kDa by densitometry. This might be due to abundance of ACE-2 protein expression in A549 cells after 5 days postconfluence. (We used cells 5 days postconfluence to maximize ACE-2 expression in our experiments.) At the same time, generation of a small quantity of cleaved ACE-2 in meconium-treated cells as compared to other groups did reach statistical significance. Table 1 shows that meconium-treated cells have increased cleaved ACE-2 at ~ 37 kDa as compared to control cells by densitometry (Western blot). We collected meconium from normal healthy term neonates without the history of meconium-stained amniotic fluid and studied the effect of meconium on ACE-2 individually. There was a wide variation in production of cleaved ACE-2 by meconium from each baby as compared to control (control vs meconium, p < 0.05, paired t test). This variation might explain the heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of MAS.",

We used a PIc which caused near complete inhibition of trypsin, chymotrypsin and pancreatic metalloprotease enzyme activities. We demonstrated that meconium-induced lung AEC apoptosis by nuclear fragmentation assay in human A549 cells is reversed by inhibiting the activities of fetal proteolytic enzymes. Ivanov et al. [15] has shown that meconium causes A549 cell detachment and the detached A549 cells were alive (using the acridine orange staining method) in contrast to our results demonstrating apoptosis after centrifugation of detached cells. It is important to point out that the acridine orange staining method is not a reliable method for detection of cell apoptosis, particularly for in vitro studies. We used the nuclear fragmentation assay which is considered the gold standard for measuring apoptosis in in vitro studies [23] [24] [25] . It has been shown that nuclear fragmentation is a crucial event in apoptosis [26] . The morphology of this event is strikingly similar in different cell types [26, 27] . Previous studies have shown that protease inhibitors can prevent cell apoptosis in response to various noxious stimuli by nuclear fragmentation assay method [28] . This method of detecting apoptosis has been validated in previous publications from our laboratory [18, 19, 29] by simultaneously using other methods (In Situ End Labelling and anti-caspase 3 immunolabeling) in human A549 cells. This observation is in agreement with studies by Zagariya and co-workers, who have demonstrated lung AEC detachment and apoptosis in meconium-induced lung injury [30]. Rosenfeld et al. showed that exposure to meconium induces AT1 receptor expression and further that losartan, an antagonist for the AT1 receptor, attenuates meconium-induced AEC apoptosis in newborn rabbit lung [31] . An extensive body of literature has shown that the ACE/ ANGII/AT1 axis promotes lung injury and is counteracted by the ACE-2/ANG1-7/Mas axis. Interestingly, previous attempts to downregulate ACE/ANGII/AT1 axis by using captopril and losartan have produced mixed results in human and animal studies [32] . In particular, ACE2 has been identified as an essential receptor for SARS coronavirus infections, as well as a protective molecule against lethal lung failure in SARS [33] . Imai et al. showed the severe acute lung injury in ACE-2 knock-out mice and symptoms of acute lung injury can be rescued by a recombinant ACE-2 protein [34] . Intriguingly, ACE2 localization was mapped to the apical surface of epithelial cells in the lungs [35] . This leads to our hypothesis that proteolytic enzymes in the meconium causes cleavage of ACE-2 present on the surface of AECs.",

This could also explain the partial reversal (50%) of ACE-2 enzyme activity by PIc. It is possible that that particular baby had a very high amount of proteolytic enzymes in the meconium; therefore, protease inhibitor could only partially inhibit pancreatic enzymes which led to only 50% restoration of ACE-2 enzyme activity.

Additional experimental studies have shown the activation of the local RAS system mediated apoptosis in response to meconium [30, 31] . This led to our speculation that maintaining high levels of tissue ACE-2 by prevention of its cleavage, and/ or replacement of the protein through administration of biologically active enzyme, may hold potential as a therapeutic strategy for treating MAS. In support of this theory, a recent pilot clinical trial of GSK2586881, a recombinant form of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (rhACE-2), was performed in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome [38] .",

This apoptotic effect is presumably due to reduction in ACE-2 activity caused by proteolytic cleavage of the lung protective enzyme ACE-2 by pancreatic digestive enzymes present in the meconium. Since it is well known that lung injury can be abrogated by ACE-2, the demonstration of a direct effect of meconium on ACE-2 in human A549 cells has significant implications. The findings from this preliminary report suggest the ACE-2 mediated RAS modification may be a viable therapeutic option for treatment of MAS.",
