            "text": "Background: The pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus has spread worldwide and infected a large proportion of the human population. Discovery of new and effective drugs for the treatment of influenza is a crucial issue for the global medical community. According to our previous study, TSL-1, a fraction of the aqueous extract from the tender leaf of Toonasinensis, has demonstrated antiviral activities against pandemic influenza A (H1N1) through the down-regulation of adhesion molecules and chemokine to prevent viral attachment. Methods: The aim of the present study was to identify the active compounds in TSL-1 which exert anti-influenza A (H1N1) virus effects. XTT assay was used to detect the cell viability. Meanwhile, the inhibitory effect on the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus was analyzed by observing plaque formation, qRT-PCR, neuraminidase activity, and immunofluorescence staining of influenza A-specific glycoprotein. Results: Both catechin and gallic acid were found to be potent inhibitors in terms of influenza virus mRNA replication and MDCK plaque formation. Additionally, both compounds inhibited neuraminidase activities and viral glycoprotein. The 50% effective inhibition concentration (EC 50 ) of catechin and gallic acid for the influenza A (H1N1) virus were 18.4 mg/mL and 2.6 mg/mL, respectively; whereas the 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC 50 ) of catechin and gallic acid were >100 mg/mL and 22.1 mg/mL, respectively. Thus, the selectivity indexes (SI) of catechin and gallic acid were >5.6 and 22.1, respectively. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that catechin might be a safe reagent for long-term use to prevent influenza A (H1N1) virus infection; whereas gallic acid might be a sensitive reagent to inhibit influenza virus infection. We conclude that these two phyto-chemicals in TSL-1 are responsible for exerting anti-pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus effects.",

Thus far, vaccination is the major resolution strategy to control seasonal influenza viral pandemics. At present, two major classes of antiviral drugs, oseltamivir and amantadine, are commonly used as the prophylaxis and for the treatment of influenza virus infection. 2 Oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor, inhibits the spread of the virus and the release of virus progeny from infected cells. While amantadine blocks the M2 protein in order to inhibit viral uncoating from the infected cells. These drugs target on a highly variable sequence, as a consequence, the virus can easily acquire resistance by mutating the drug targets. Recently, increasing resistance of influenza A viruses to amantadine and oseltamivir has been reported. 3 The discovery of new and effective drugs for preventing and/or treating influenza infections is a crucial challenge for the global medical community.",

As reported, [5] [6] [7] [8] TS extracts have been used to treat various diseases and have been shown to have a variety of effects, including glycemic control, inhibition of lipid accumulation, antimicrobial activity and anti-cancer. Many compounds, including retinoids, catechin, gallic acid, kaempferol, methyl gallate, quercetin, afzelin, quercitrin, isoquercitrin, and rutin have been isolated from the leaves of TS. 6 According to our previous study, TSL-1 has been verified to inhibit attachment activity towards pandemic influenza A (H1N1) through down-regulation of adhesion molecules to prevent virus infection. 9 As of yet, it is unclear which major compounds in TSL-1 execute the anti-influenza A (H1N1) virus activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate those chemical compounds present in TSL-1, including catechin, gallic acid, kaempferol, quercetin, and rutin, to examine the inhibition of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus replication in a cell model.

Amantadine (10 mg/mL) was used as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 1 , the CC 50 of those five compounds were as below. The CC 50 of catechin (Fig. 1A) , kaempferol (Fig. 1C) , quercetin hydrate (Fig. 1D ) and rutintrihydrate (Fig. 1E ) were more than 100 mg/mL. The CC 50 of gallic acid (Fig. 1B) was at 22.1 \u00b1 0.6 mg/mL. The EC 50 of catechin might be around 10e25 mg/mL (Fig. 1A) . The EC 50 of gallic acid will be around 1e5 mg/mL (Fig. 1B) . Our results demonstrated that catechin and gallic acid exerted protective effects against pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection with a dose-dependent manner under 100 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL treatment, respectively. The other three compounds also had a protective effect against the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus, but not as prominent or dose-dependent, in comparison with catechin and gallic acid. Based on the above findings, we selected catechin and gallic acid for further investigation.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses generally infect approximately 10% of the global population annually, and are associated with approximately 250,000 deaths each year. 11 The influenza A (H1N1) virus is a novel and highly contagious pathogen for humans, associated with a high risk of severe complications, and first identified in Mexico in 2009, causing seasonal epidemics and pandemics. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) are approved for use against Type A and Type B influenza infections. However, the development of drug resistance due to the use of insufficient doses or inadequate courses of therapy, may limit the future clinical applications of these drugs. 12 Based on the limitations of health care resources and the high cost of current antiviral drugs, in addition to the development of drug resistance, the need to develop new antiinfluenza treatments is of utmost importance to the global community. Chinese herbs are traditionally used for preventing and treating influenza in Taiwan, especially in rural regions. Recently, Isatisindigotica (Ban-Lan-Gen) has been reported to effectly inhibit the attachment ability of influenza A and B viruses by interfering with the viral particles of the host cell surface. 5, 13 Paeonialactiflora has also been demonstrated to inhibit influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) infection, both in vitro and in vivo, through viral hemagglutination with viral binding and penetration into host cells. 14 Furthermore, Mosladianthera has exhibited therapeutic effects in influenza A virus-infected mice by suppressing the viral replication and inflammatory mediators, and by boosting the antioxidant potential to prevent subsequent pneumonia occurrence. 15 TSL-1 is a fraction of the aqueous extract from the tender leaf of TS, a vegetable commonly consumed by Taiwanese in daily life. Our previous study found that TSL-1 had the effect of inhibiting the coronavirus, the life-threatening and highly contagious virus which induces severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 16 Meanwhile, TSL-1 inhibits influenza A (H1N1) virus attachment through significant down-regulation of adhesion molecules and chemokines, including VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin, IL-8, and fractalkine. 9 This aqueous extract of TS was characterized by HPLC. Nine compounds present in TS, gallic acid, methyl gallate, catechin, kaempferol, kaempferol 3-O-b-D-glucoside, quercetin, quercitrin, Fig. 2 . Catechin and gallic acid inhibited influenza virus propagation. Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus at an MOI of 1.5 was inoculated in A549 cells. After 1 h, viruses were removed. A549 cells were treated with (A) catechin (5e100 mg/mL), (B) gallic acid (0.5e10 mg/mL) individually. The cultures were incubated for 3 days at 37 C under 5% CO 2 . The yield of progeny viruses in A549 cells was determined by plaque titrations assay on MDCK cells. Each concentration of chemicals was analyzed in triplicate. The results represented the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent assays. Asterisk (*) indicates significant difference (p <0 .05) compared to the vehicle control respectively. Fig. 1 . Cytotoxicity assay of five chemical compounds. A549 cells were infected with or without virus at an MOI of 1.5 at various concentrations of each chemical compound. Cell viability was measured after 3 days by using XTT viability assay. Five chemical compounds included (A) catechin, (B) gallic acid, (C) kaempferol, (D) quercetin, and (E) rutin. To normalize, the relative viability in untreated cells was set as 100%. The results represented the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent assays. Asterisk and pound (*, # ) indicate significant difference (p < 0.05) compared to the control group without or with the treatment of virus infection, respectively. quercetin 3-O-b-D-glucoside, and rutin, have previously been reported as exerting positive effects in terms of disease treatment . 17 Thus, we chose the major five compounds, catechin, gallic acid, kaempferol, quercetin, and rutin, which are all commercially available, to further investigate their antiinfluenza A (H1N1) virus effects. Analyses found that both catechin and gallic acid had protective effects. The present study demonstrates that gallic acid is effective at inhibiting influenza A (H1N1) virus, but is toxic to A549 cells, in comparison with catechin. While catechin demonstrates an inhibitory effect against the influenza A (H1N1) virus, it is also more promising in terms of safety. The other three major compounds are either cytotoxic to A549 cells, or offer less protective effects against influenza A (H1N1) virus infection.",

Total RNA extraction was performed at 3 days after influenza virus infection and the levels of intracellular influenza viral RNA replication was measured by qRT-PCR. Each concentration of chemicals was assayed in triplicate. The results represented the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent assays. Asterisk (*) indicates significant difference (p < 0.05) compared to the vehicle control, respectively. months had a statistically significant preventive effect on clinically defined influenza infection and was well-tolerated. 20 They conclude that green tea may be an effective prophylaxis for influenza infection. Furthermore, the clinical trial by Yamada et al has shown that gargling with tea containing catechin extracts had the effect of preventing influenza virus infection in elderly nursing home residents. 21 Catechin has been assessed in terms of its ability to interact with influenza neuraminidase, and to significantly suppress the increased ROS level to prevent influenza infection. 22, 23 Gallic acid is easy to extract from a number of plants, fruits, teas, and cloves. Gallic acid reportedly has potent and broad antiviral activity against influenza A and B type viruses, both in vitro and in vivo. 24 Theisen et al reported the cytotoxic and antiviral activities against H1N1 virus (H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/ 34-NS116-GFP) of gallic acid with CC 50 , EC 50 and SI were 770.5 mM, 50.8 mM, and 15.2 mM, respectively, which differs from the results reported from the present study. 25 This could possibly result from the different viral strains used in experimentation. In addition, the therapeutic safety of gallic acid was found to be lower than other hydrolysable tannins and pseudotannins. 25 In this study, we found that both of these two compounds indeed exerted anti-influenza A (H1N1) virus replication via significant inhibition of viral RNA synthesis. Meanwhile, catechin and gallic acid were shown to inhibit the growth of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) with EC50 of 18.4 mg/mL and 2.6 mg/mL in MDCK cells, and SI of >5.6 and 8.6, respectively. It indicated that catechin might be a safe reagent for long-term use in the prevention of influenza A (H1N1) virus infection; whereas gallic acid might be a sensitive reagent to inhibit influenza virus infection, and a promising candidate to protect the host against pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. Therefore, TSL-1 may be used as a food supplement or as an adjunct therapy with current drugs to prevent influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. Fig. 4 . Measurement of the anti-viral activity of catechin and gallic acid by using neuraminidase activity assay. A549 cells were infected with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. After 1 h, viruses were removed. A549 cells were treated with (A) catechin (5e100 mg/mL) and (B) gallic acid (0.5e10 mg/mL). Fluorescence was monitored with excitation of wavelength 535 nm and emission of wavelength 590 nm. Each experiment was repeated three times independently and differences were shown at *p < 0.05 significantly. In conclusion, this study provides evidence to support that catechin and gallic acid inhibit pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus activity. As such, catechin has the promise of being a low-toxic, abundantly available treatment for the prevention of the influenza infection. Furthermore, gallic acid offers the potential of being developed into a new drug due to its significant anti-influenza virus effects, with less cytotoxic effects at low doses to the host cells. However, more specific characterization of the active compounds and mechanisms providing protective effects against influenza virus infection requires further investigation. At present, both catechin and gallic acid may provide effective alternatives as replacements or supplements for currently available anti-influenza remedies. ",
