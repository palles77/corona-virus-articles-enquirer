            "text": "The coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome contains a small envelope protein, E, with putative involvement in host apoptosis and virus morphogenesis. To perform these functions, it has been suggested that protein E can form a membrane destabilizing transmembrane (TM) hairpin, or homooligomerize to form a TM pore. Indeed, in a recent study we reported that the a-helical putative transmembrane domain of E protein (ETM) forms several SDS-resistant TM interactions: a dimer, a trimer, and two pentameric forms. Further, these interactions were found to be evolutionarily conserved. Herein, we have studied multiple isotopically labeled ETM peptides reconstituted in model lipid bilayers, using the orientational parameters derived from infrared dichroic data. We show that the topology of ETM is consistent with a regular TM a-helix. Further, the orientational parameters obtained unequivocally correspond to a homopentameric model, by comparison with previous predictions. We have independently confirmed that the full polypeptide of E protein can also aggregate as pentamers after expression in Escherichia coli. This interaction must be stabilized, at least partially, at the TM domain. The model we report for this pentameric a-helical bundle may explain some of the permabilizing properties of protein E, and should be the basis of mutagenesis efforts in future functional studies.",

This protein is very important for virus morphogenesis, to the point that it has been found to be critical for viral budding in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (2) .

A search of the possible interhelical interactions in the transmembrane domain of E protein (ETM) was performed using a total of 17 homologs of SARS-CoV E, present in other viruses. We showed that only three homooligomeric models had been conserved by evolution of the viruses: a dimer, a trimer, and two similar pentamers. Due to the special nature of our simulation, totally independent from experimental measurements, and only dependent on the disturbing effect of conservative mutations on non native models, we predicted (12) that all these oligomers should be found in vivo.",

We have then determined the orientation in space of these labeled peptidic carbonyl groups using the theory of site specific infrared dichroism (SSID) (16) . Like any orientational technique, SSID has certain limitations. First, it requires a certain order of the sample, and therefore is not applicable to proteins in solution. Also, it requires a known periodicity in the sample, which is found in a-helical segments. Finally, the requirement for discrimination between neighboring peptide carbonyl orientations makes it unsuitable when a-helices are either completely parallel or perpendicular to the membrane normal. SSID is therefore ideal to study TMH bundles, where all the above conditions are met (14, 15, 17) .",

The peptides were cleaved from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and lyophilized. The lyophilized peptides were purified by HPLC and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (12) . Lyophilization was performed always in the presence of HCl (typically at an approximate molar ratio 20:1, HCl/peptide) to avoid the formation of peptide-TFA adducts; consequently, the typical TFA band at ;1685 cm \u00ff1 was not observed in the amide I region. Peptide purity was further confirmed by mass spectrometry. During the synthesis of ETM, an amino acid bearing a 13 C\u00bc 18 O carbonyl group was introduced at a specific position ( Fig. 1 B, open circles). A mutation was introduced in two of the peptides, N15A and F23A ( Fig. 1 B, residues underlined). In the first case (N15A), this was done to observe if Asn substitution had a critical destabilizing effect on the oligomers, because Asn-Asn interactions were predicted to be present in all evolutionarily conserved oligomeric models (12) . The second mutation, F23A, was assumed to be critical in view of its suggested central role in the formation of a putative palindromic helical hairpin (23). The arrows indicate the direction of the C\u00bcO bond relative to the z axis.

This suggests that this mutation not only does not perturb the oligomeric forms present in SDS (see Fig. 2 ) but also does not alter significantly the structure of the oligomer in lipid bilayers. Similarly, our results show that the substitution F23A did not affect the orientation of the a-helices: when the dichroic data from the label introduced at position A23 (Fig. 1 B, asterisks) was combined with V24 or A22, a solution was found which was consistent with the v-values expected for the pentameric B model. Together with the electrophoresis results, which show that none of the oligomeric forms are affected by mutation F23A (Fig. 2) , this suggests that F23 does not play any essential role in either maintaining the oligomeric structure or in defining a particular topology.

To confirm this topology, we labeled ETM with Phe-CN, a nitrile derivatized phenylalanine, at these three positions (see Fig. 1 B, solid dots) . The rationale for this experiment is provided by the sensitivity of the C[N stretching vibration of this nitrile derivatized side chain to the hydration and polarity of the environment (35, 36) . If the side chain is fully hydrated, the band is centered at 2235 cm \u00ff1 in contrast, when inserted deep in phospholipid bilayers, this band shifts to lower wavenumbers, at 2229 cm \u00ff1 , and becomes narrower (35) . Fig. 5 shows the C[N stretching vibration of the three nitrile derivatized amino acids when ETM is reconstituted in DMPC lipid bilayers. Clearly, for all three Phe residues, the band is centered at ;2230 cm \u00ff1 . This indicates a generally hydrophobic and dehydrated environment, consistent with these Phe residues being deeply buried in the lipid bilayer.",

This modification, which we also used in a previous report (12) was made to improve solubility and purification (37) . It has been demonstrated (38, 39) for various TM oligomers, e.g., monomeric epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), dimeric glycophorin A (GpA), and tetrameric M2 from Influenza A, that even with up to four flanking lysines at each C-and N-termini, oligomerization is not affected during SDS PAGE electrophoresis. Also, electrophoretic mobility has been reported to be reduced ;30% when three lysines are added at each terminus (38) . In this work, with only two lysines on each side, the error in molecular weight estimation should not be higher than 20%. In support that a pentameric form of whole E protein is also present in SDS, we show bands consistent with pentamers (;46 kDa), along with monomers (;9 kDa) and some dimers (;17 kDa) of E protein when expressed in E. coli in reducing conditions. In a previous work (8) only monomers (;9 kDa), dimers (;18 kDa), and trimers (;27 kDa) were observed, but only under nonreducing conditions. We are unable to explain these variations in the oligomeric species observed, but they may be related to the complex functionality of SARS-CoV E. In any case, the band at (;46 kDa) cannot be interpreted as being trimers, because these were observed previously at ;27 kDa (8). Incidentally, a pentameric homooligomer has also been observed in other similarly sized viral membrane proteins, e.g., the small (63 residues) hydrophobic protein in the respiratory syncytial virus (40, 41) . It is possible therefore that these two proteins perform similar functions. In this respect, E protein has been found to induce in vivo permeabilization of biological membranes to bulky molecules 1 and 2) , respectively, on a 15% SDS polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 150 mM DTT and 2% SDS. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with polyclonal anti His tag antibody in 1:1000 dilution. This was by followed incubating with horse radishperoxidase conjugated anti rabbit IgG and the E protein was detected by a chemiluminescence detection kit.

Although a pentameric porelike structure cannot explain permeabilization to these big molecules, it can explain the permeability to cations observed in an in vitro system (9) . If model B were correct, the narrowest constriction site along the lumen occurs at F26 (see Fig. 7) , with a diameter of only 1.66 \u00c5 (the effective diameter of a water molecule is ;2 \u00c5 ). Clearly, the model pentamer B is not consistent with an open channel (the diameter of naked Na 1 or Ca 21 is ;2 \u00c5 , and that of K 1 is even larger, 2.66 \u00c5 ). We note that similar constriction diameters have been found for other channels in a closed state, e.g., 1 \u00c5 in KirBac (42), a bacterial homolog of mammalian inward rectifier K channels. Considering the model A orientation from residues 24-27 however, the channel appears more open. Our experimental data can only be explained by a bend of the a-helices around residues 25-27, with residues 17-24 consistent with pentamer B and 24 onward consistent with pentamer A. The only partial consistency with the computational models may be explained by the fact that during the simulations of ETM (12) we restrained the helix tilt to a particular value, and effects such as bends or kinks, if existed in the native structure, were not accounted for. The result of this simplistic assumption may have been that, instead of a single pentameric model, two different models were obtained with only a partially correct orientation in different parts of the sequence. This conclusion is supported by the fact that none of these two models contained all the lowest energy structures for the 17 sequences analyzed, although most of them (16) were in agreement with model A and only 1 (PHEV) with model B.",

Equally for the pair 22/24, if Dv ; 200\u00b0. We also note that if the helix tilt determined previously without any isotopic label (23) was #6\u00b0, we should be unable to calculate v-angles for the different residues, because the transition dipole moment of any peptidic C\u00bcO bond would have a similar orientation relative to the z axis. In other words, SSID can only provide orientational information if the tilt is at least 10\u00b0. In this work, the helix tilt found is in the range 20-30\u00b0. We conclude therefore that the topology of ETM in our preparation is not the same as the preparation used to report a TM hairpin (23, 45) .",

It is possible that the presence of these positively charged lysines favors a transmembrane topology, and not a hairpin. In any case, the pentameric form we report is unlikely to be an artifact, because these TM interactions and oligomeric size are consistent with evolutionary conservation data and expression of the complete SARS-CoV E polypeptide, and also consistent with the reported ion channel activity. Clearly, more than one topology is possible for ETM, especially considering the range of attributed roles for this small protein.",
