We constructed primers for inefficient reverse transcription of ribosomal sequences based on the distribution analysis of hexanucleotide patterns in ribosomal RNA. The analysis revealed that distributions of hexanucleotide patterns in ribosomal RNA and virus genome were different. We constructed 96 hexanucleotides (non-ribosomal hexanucleotides) and used them as mixed primers for reverse transcription of cDNA RDA. A synchronous analysis of hexanucleotide patterns in known viral sequences showed that all the known genomic-size viral sequences include non-ribosomal hexanucleotides. In a model experiment, when non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were used as primers, in vitro transcribed plasmid RNA was efficiently reverse transcribed when compared with ribosomal RNA of rat cells. Using nonribosomal primers, the cDNA fragments of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 were efficiently amplified by subtracting the cDNA amplicons derived from uninfected cells from those that were derived from virus-infected cells. The results suggest that cDNA RDA with non-ribosomal primers can be used for species-independent detection of viruses, including new viruses.",

For example, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was controlled after the identification of the causative agent coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1) . Developments in molecular biological approaches in recent years have led to the identification of many unknown pathogens. Once a fragment from the agent's genome has been isolated and sequenced, standard genomic walking techniques are used to extend the known sequence, and computer homology searches can then be used to identify the likely phylogenetic relationship of the agent with other known organisms (2) . Additionally, sequences of some viruses, such as SARS-CoV, have altered during transmission, and this may prevent the detection of the virus by a PCR method (3, 4) . Thus, a detection method that is not based on the known sequence is essentially required as an alternative method to the normal PCR method.",

The determination of sequences of these fragments resulted in the discovery of the KS-associated herpes virus (7) . Despite the fact that RDA has been developed for detecting agents with a DNA-based genome, it can be used to detect the presence or absence of RNA in a sample by generating a cDNA intermediate (cDNA RDA) to amplify the RNA (8) . Since a large quantity of ribosomal RNAs interfere with cDNA RDA, the cDNA intermediate should be synthesized from poly(A) + RNA. Therefore, it is difficult to detect RNA viruses from virus-infected cells by cDNA RDA because many viruses have no poly(A) at the end of the genome. If cDNA RDA can be applied to total RNA without interference with ribosomal RNAs, the virus genome can be amplified from total RNA of virus-infected cells by cDNA RDA.",

Primers that are specific to a viral genome also efficiently eliminate the influence of ribosomal RNAs. However, prior knowledge of the virus genome is required for the construction of specific primers. In this study, based on the fact that cDNA can be primed with a mixture of oligomers, we constructed a set of oligomers that was inefficient for priming ribosomal RNAs but that normally primed most of the genome of an RNA virus (9, 10) . Based on the frequency distribution of hexanucleotides in ribosomal RNAs and viral sequences in current public databases, we determined a mixture of 96 hexanucleotides that rarely prime ribosomal RNAs but can prime all the known mammalian viruses listed in public databases.

We created three programs, GREG, GAS and OSC (produced by C's Labs, Sapporo, Japan and licensed by Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd, St Louis, MO), connected to a MySQL database server (version 4.0.20). The program GREG transformed FASTA-formatted sequence to a textformatted sequence and inserted it into a table in the  MySQL database (GREG table) . Using these programs, we designed a mixture of hexanucleotide primers. First, sequences were divided into hexamers, and each hexamer was classified into a pattern of hexanucleotide sequence in which 4 6 = 4096 patterns were included. The program GAS generated frequency distributions of hexanucleotides in the sequences in the GREG table, extracted the progeny with their probabilities  of hexanucleotide patterns and inserted them into a table (GAS  table) of the database. We made four sets of GREG and GAS tables for rat ribosomal RNAs, a satellite repeat, BPI3 and SARS-CoV (Table 1 ).

The table  included EMBL ID, title, annotation and sequence as fields. The annotation field included taxonomic classification of the origin of the data. We separated the words included in the annotation field into taxonomic words, such as family names, and inserted them into a new table (taxonomic table) , in which EMBL IDs and taxonomic words were included. We then selected EMBL IDs of mammalian viruses with any of the viral family names listed in Table 5 from the taxonomic table. Next, sequences of mammalian viruses were divided into groups according to their species presented in the taxonomic table. To determine the targets for hexanucleotide analysis, EMBL IDs having the longest sequence in the species were selected as the estimated genomic sequence of the virus, and then, a new table named 'Sequences of viral species' was prepared. Although the longest sequence from each species was selected, some of these sequences were very short. Therefore, we eliminated sequences that were shorter than half of the common genomic size of each viral family. The resultant 1791 viral sequences were inserted into a table titled 'Genomic sequence of viral species'.

For experimental use, the cells were split once in 25 cm 2 flasks and cultured until they reached 100% confluence. Prior to the virus infection, the culture medium was replaced with 2% FBS containing DMEM. SARS-CoV, which was isolated as Frankfurt1 and kindly provided by Dr J. Ziebuhr (16) , was used in the present study. The viral infection was established in the cells with a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) of 10.

Among the sequences of 30 selected clones, the sequences of 25 clones and 5 clones were highly homologous to those of ribosomal RNA and a 1399 bp satellite repeat (GenBank accession no. V00125), respectively. Based on this result, ribosomal and satellite sequences were determined for analysing hexanucleotide frequency. Since the reported ribosomal sequences of mammals are highly homologous to each other, we selected rat premature 18S, 5.8S and 28S ribosomal sequences as ribosomal sequences for hexanucleotide frequency analysis. Genome sequences of SARS-CoV and BPI3 were selected as representatives of RNA viral sequence. Table 1 shows the probabilities [number of the patterns/(length of sequence \u00b7 2)] of hexanucleotides in the human ribosomal RNA, V00125 satellite repeat, BPI3 and SARS-CoV. If a random sequence is assumed, frequencies would be distributed according to the Poisson's distribution, and the average of frequency would be the same as the variance of frequency. Although the average/variance ratios of all the four sequences were <1, the ratio of ribosomal RNA was smallest in these sequences (Table 3 ). This value suggests that the probabilities of hexamer patterns of ribosomal RNA were strongly biased from random sequence. Based on histograms of probabilities, the distribution of the probabilities of hexamer patterns in ribosomal RNA differed greatly from those of V00125 satellite repeat or BPI3 (Figure 1 ). It should be noted that 8 hexanucleotides did not exist and over 90 hexanucleotides were rare in the ribosomal sequence. To determine primer sequences that do not prime ribosomal RNA but prime viral RNA, the probabilities of hexamer patterns in ribosomal RNA and satellite repeat were calculated. The hexamer patterns were then realigned in an ascending order according to the sum of probabilities, and the 1st to 96th patterns were selected as non-ribosomal hexanucleotides, i.e. we selected 96 rarest hexanucleotide patterns ( Table 2 , non-ribosomal hexanucleotides) in major transcripts in normal mammalian cells on the assumption that ribosomal RNA and transcripts from satellites are the most frequent transcripts in normal cells. The rarity of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides in comparison with non-V00125-satellite and random hexamers was confirmed in reported sequences of mammalian ribosomal RNAs (Table 4 ). The probabilities were relatively low in all the mammalian ribosomal sequences reported in GenBank. It is considered that non-ribosomal hexanucleotides inefficiently primed ribosomal RNAs in reverse transcription. On the other hand, the probabilities of non-ribosomal, non-V00125-satellite or random hexamers were different among the satellite sequences.",

We investigated the effect of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides on cDNA synthesis by using in vitro synthesized plasmid RNA (artificial RNA) and total cellular RNA, including ribosomal RNAs. An autoradiogram of 32 P-labelled double-stranded cDNAs that were synthesized using non-ribosomal hexanucleotides or a random primer and subsequently separated by agarose gel electrophoresis is shown in Figure 2 . When test and total cellular RNAs were reverse transcribed individually, the efficiencies of cDNA synthesis from artificial RNA using random and non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were almost similar; however, the efficiency of cDNA synthesis of cellular RNA was markedly lower in a non-ribosomal hexanucleotide-primed cDNA sample than in a random primer-primed cDNA sample (Figure 2A ). In the mixed samples of test and total cellular RNAs, ribosomal RNAs were inefficiently reverse transcribed with nonribosomal hexanucleotides. The total incorporated counts in non-ribosomal hexanucleotides-primed cDNAs decreased with a decrease in the proportion of the test RNA in the mixed RNA samples (Figure 2A) . It is considered that the efficiency of reverse transcription depends on the proportions of the test RNA in the mixed RNAs. When approximately the same counts of cDNAs were loaded on the gel, synthesis of ribosomal RNA-derived cDNA (ribosomal cDNA) was obvious in random primer-primed cDNAs ( Figure 2B) . . From each sequence, the frequency was determined for each hexanucleotide pattern by using programs described in Materials and Methods. Probability was calculated as (frequency of a motif/total length of sequence). For simple comparison, the probabilities of ribosome RNAs and satellite repeat or SARS-CoV and BPI3 were added for each hexanucleotide pattern. Hexanucleotide patterns were aligned according to their probability in the ribosomal RNAs. When the probabilities of hexanucleotide patterns were larger than 0.005, the data were omitted. Sequences of the non-V00125 and random hexamers are supplemented online. Probabilities of the hexanucleotide-sets in 2464 reported satellite repeat are also supplemented online. Sequences for species were selected according to their length as described in Materials and Methods. The total probability in each species was calculated as the summation of probabilities of all non-ribosomal hexanucleotides in sense and complementary sequences of a viral genomic sequence that was selected as described in Materials and Methods. The probabilities of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides in 1791 virus genomic sequences are supplemented online. On the other hand, the synthesis of ribosomal cDNA was not obvious in the cDNA primed with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides. A relatively large cDNA derived from artificial RNA could be observed even when a smaller proportion of test RNA was mixed with cellular RNA and non-ribosomal hexanucleotide-primed samples. These data suggest that the relative amount of test RNA-derived cDNA is greater in non-ribosomal hexanucleotides-primed samples than in random primer-primed samples.",

The amount of ribosomal RNA has been reported to be 1000-fold greater than that of frequently transcribed mRNA, such as beta actin and G6PDH. Thus, the repertoire of cDNA would be strongly affected by ribosomal RNA. This influence of ribosomal RNA has been avoided by oligo(dT) selection. Alternative strategy for the elimination of ribosomal RNA from total RNA, however, has not been developed. Therefore, there have been only a few applications of cDNA RDA for non-poly(A) RNA, such as those in viral genomes.

However, methods using multiple primers for simultaneous gene amplification have been recently employed for DNA chip methods. In order to simultaneously detect multiple genes by using a DNA chip, mixed oligonucleotides have been used as a primer for reverse transcription. This usage of mixed primers was based on the assumption that the specificity of primers was equal to the summation of the specificity of each primer. Thus, we searched for primers that do not prime ribosomal RNAs by frequency analysis of hexanucleotides. The frequency and distribution of oligonucleotides in mammalian and viral genomes have been studied to search for common motifs that might be used for controlling cellular functions (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . Volinia et al. (22) found sets of common decamers that can be used for the control of transcription control signals or for the common amplification of viruses. Programs for frequency Figure 5 . Agarose gel electrophoresis of RDA products with PCR products used for probes for hybridization (A) and a hybridized fluorogram (B). RNA was extracted from SARS-CoV-infected cells and subjected to RDA according to the method described in Materials and Methods. Mock-infected cells were used for the synthesis of driver amplicons for RDA. One-twentieth of the volume of the amplified products was separated on 3% agarose gels and blotted on a Nylon membrane. The membrane was then cut into slits that contained the lane showing the presence of DNA. On the other hand, the PCR fragments predicted to be amplified in the RDA reaction were amplified and subsequently ascertained by agarose gel electrophoresis (A). The amplified genomic fragments of SARS-CoV were Dig-labelled and used as probes for hybridization to each slit of the Nylon membrane containing the RDA product. Hybridization was performed in separate hybridization bags. After washing with 1\u00b7 SSC and 0.1% SDS solution, the hybridized probes were detected on a fluorogram (B). Positions and sizes (bp) of markers are present on the left. analysis have been useful for searching common oligonucleotides in many subsets of sequences. On the other hand, database programming is useful not only for searching common oligonucleotides but also for searching oligonucleotides that do not exist in a subset of sequences. In this study, we found that there were hexanucleotide patterns that were rare or that did not exist in ribosomal RNA sequences. We also showed that sequences of 96 selected non-ribosomal hexanucleotides are normally present in known viral sequences ( Table 5) .",
