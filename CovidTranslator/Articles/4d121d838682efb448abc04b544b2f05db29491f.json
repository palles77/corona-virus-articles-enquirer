The virus was proved to be a new coronavirus by RT-PCR and it responded positively to convalescent-phase serum specimen from SARS patients, which is the evidence that this new virus is etiologically linked to the outbreak of SARS. The morphogenesis and distribution of the virus are also discussed in this article.",
