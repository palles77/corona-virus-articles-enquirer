            "text": "The ability of cyclodextrins to enhance the antiviral activity of a phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide has been investigated. A 18-mer oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to the initiation region of the mRNA coding for the spike protein and containing the intergenic consensus sequence of an enteric coronavirus has been tested for antiviral action against virus growth in human adenocarcinoma cells. The phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide only showed a limited effect on virus growth rate (from 12 to 34% viral inhibition in cells treated with 7.5 to 25 mM oligodeoxynucleotide, respectively, at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 infectious particle per cell). In the same conditions, the phosphorothioate analogue exhibited stronger antiviral activity, the inhibition increased from 56 to 90%. The inhibitory effect of this analogue was antisense and sequence-speci\u00aec. Northern blot analysis showed that the sequence-dependent mechanism of action appears to be the inhibition of mRNA transcription. We conclude that the coronavirus intergenic consensus sequence is a good target for an antisense oligonucleotide antiviral action. The properties of the phosphodiester oligonucleotide was improved after its complexation with cyclodextrins. The most important increase of the antiviral activity (90% inhibition) was obtained with only 7.5 mM oligonucleotide complexed to a cyclodextrin derivative, 6-deoxy-6-S-b-D-galactopyranosyl-6-thio-cyclomaltoheptaose in a molar ratio of 1:100. These studies suggest that the use of cyclodextrin derivatives as carrier for phosphodiester oligonucleotides delivery may be an effective method for increasing the therapeutic potential of these compounds in viral infections.",

            "text": "The use of antisense oligonucleotides is an interesting approach to study cellular and viral gene function and to block gene expression [2, 3, 60] . Oligonucleotides have been considered as ideal agents for inhibiting viral replication due in part to their high speci\u00aecity for viral DNA and RNA sequences. These agents have been successfully employed to block the replication and cellular expression of several viruses, including herpes simplex virus [20] , cytomegalovirus [43] and especially human immunode\u00aeciency virus [33] . However, the vulnerability of oligonuleotides to nucleases' attack, combined with their intracellular distribution and uptake properties, have limited their therapeutic potential. To avoid the problem of nucleases' digestion and to improve the cellular uptake of oligonucleotides, either chemical modi\u00aecations of the internucleoside phosphodiester linkages [35] or of the ribose sugar [25] and various oligonucleotide conjugates have been tested. One chemical analog that is widely employed for enhanced stability is the phosphorothioate oligonucleotide. But, although this analog has increased resistance to degradation in vivo and in vitro [1, 46, 59] it has exhibited sequence-speci\u00aec and non sequence-speci\u00aec activities [11, 54, 55] . The oligonucleotide conjugates include oligonucleotide adsorbed onto poly (isobutylcyanoacrylate) nanoparticles [40] , encapsulated in liposomes [23] or conjugated to the cholesterol [18, 26] . These strategies have resulted in an increase of the cellular uptake of oligonucleotide and / or stability against nucleases. However, the inherent properties of the cholesterol, liposomes or nanoparticles carriers led to increase the immunogenicity of the oligonucleotide complex and the tendency of the complex to be phagocytosed by the reticuloendothelial system [44] .",

It frameworks describes a group of cyclic polysaccharides containing 6 to 8 glucose units in a- (1, 4) linkage (a-CD, b-CD and g-CD have respectively 6, 7 or 8 glucose units). They possess an hydrophobic internal cavity which can include various small molecules and a peripheral structure containing a large number of hydroxyl groups making the molecule water soluble. The cyclodextrins form complexes with numerous compounds and b-cyclodextrin is the most employed for numerous applications. A wide variety of cyclodextrins and derivatives has been studied to enhance the solubility and the availability of various water-soluble and water-insoluble pharmacological agents [6, 9, 21, 38, 64] . This approach using cyclodextrin derivatives has been recently studied to increase the cellular uptake of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides [65] . In this work, we have investigated the ability of native b-and gcyclodextrins and b-cyclodextrin derivatives as carriers to enhance the antiviral activity of a phosphodiester oligonucleotide directed toward the initiation region of the mRNA coding for the spike protein and containing the intergenic consensus sequence of an enteric coronavirus.",

These viruses cause acute and / or persistent infections and might be etiological agents for autoimmune diseases [16, 41, 45] . They are enveloped viruses which contain a single-stranded, positive-sensed polyadenylated genome. They possess three or four major structural proteins. All coronaviruses have spike (S), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins and some have a haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein. In addition, there are at least four genes that encode nonstructural proteins (ns1 to 4) [29, 58] . During the replication in infected cells, genomic RNA is transcribed into genomesized, negative-stranded RNA which serves as template for the synthesis of a 3 Hcoterminal nested set of 7 to 8 subgenomic mRNAs [52, 56] and only the 5 Hproximal region which is not present in the next smaller RNA of the set is used for translation [48] . Another unique feature of coronavirus mRNAs is that the 5 H ends of genomic RNA and of all mRNAs contain a 72\u00b177 nucleotide-long leader sequence [27, 28] . Studies made on the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis [10, 50] have shown that the 3 H end of the leader sequence contains a repeated UCUAA pentanucleotide sequence included in the unique UCUAAAC consensus sequence (or similar sequence) observed in all intergenic regions of genomic RNA. Thus the mRNA transcriptional start is the result of the interaction between the leader sequence of the positive-stranded RNA and the complementary antileader sequence of the negative-stranded RNA [49, 50] .",

The absence of a more signi\u00aecant inhibitory effect of this oligonucleotide may be related to its rapid degradation by nucleases and to its reduced cellular uptake. Our observations about the cellular uptake of\u00afuorescein-conjugated oligonucleotides have revealed (data not shown) that only 1 mM of S \u00c0 oligo is quickly (`1 h) internalized by HRT-18 cells and that\u00afuorescence is present both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of cells. In contrast, intracellular localization of even 20 mM of O \u00c0 oligo can not be noticed. Studies have shown [8, 22, 62] that the uptake of oligonucleotides is a complex process which depends on many factors including cell type, structure and chemical modi\u00aecations of oligonucleotides, temperature and time of incubation. This uptake is a saturable process that probably occurs through an 80 kD protein but the true role of this protein is still unknown [5, 34] . The stronger inhibitory effect observed with S \u00c0 oligo could be related to an increase in stability and in lipophilicity resulting from the replacement of the oxygen atom by sulfur [15] . It has thus been reported that phosphorothioate oligonucleotides are more strongly associated with cell membranes than the corresponding phosphodiester [8] .",

            "text": "It is noteworthy that non-sequence-speci\u00aec oligonucleotides can inhibit HIV replication especially at high concentrations [53\u00b155]. So, a random unrelated phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (S r oligo) with the same base composition as S \u00c0 oligo but without homology with any known sequence in genomic RNA shows no activity. Therefore, the inhibition of virus growth does not seem to be due to a non-sequence-speci\u00aec effect. In addition a sense oligonucleotide (S oligo) at any concentration employed does not inhibit virus growth showing that the antiviral mechanism of action of S \u00c0 oligo is antisense. These results are con\u00aermed by northern blotting analysis in which all transcripts are signi\u00aecantly reduced in infected cells when 25 mM of S \u00c0 oligo is used. In contrast RNAs levels are unaffected by non-speci\u00aec control (S r oligo) or by sense (S oligo) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides. In addition, northern blotting shows that the antisense phosphorothioate S \u00c0 oligo acts through a transcription inhibition mechanism in which the duplex made by hybridization of positive-stranded genomic RNA and S \u00c0 oligo stops the synthesis of the full length negative stranded-RNA preventing so a subgenomic and genomic RNA synthesis. The non-inhibitory effect of the sense oligonucleotide could be explained by considering the viral replication mechanism. The transcription of the mRNA is initiated after the hybridization between the leader and anti-leader sequences. The anti-leader sequence contains the anti-consensus sequence which is the target of the sense oligonucleotide. Consequently, we assume that a competition occurs between the leader sequence and the sense oligonucleotide for hybridization to their target. This competition might be in favour of the leader sequence mainly due to its total complementarity to its target and due also to a highest af\u00aenity. Our results provide evidence that the coronavirus intergenic consensus sequence of the positive-stranded genomic RNA is a good target for an antisense oligonucleotide antiviral action. The inhibiting effect on virus growth is mediated by the ability of the oligonucleotide to interfere with mRNA transcription.",

            "text": "However, some potential disadvantages may be inherent to the use of phosphorothioate analogs. There is no assurance that substitution of a phosphorothioate for a phosphodiester in an oligonucleotide would preserve its ability to bind with similar high af\u00aenity to its target. In addition studies have shown [14] that the sulfur on phosphorothioate may provide a novel reactive center on a DNA molecule for drug interactions and this interaction may affect the ef\u00aecacy of the antisense compound. It may also act by viral polymerase inhibition or by interference with viral adsorption or penetration or by inhibition of cellular enzymes or growth factors [55] . Moreover commercially phosphorothioates tend to be more expensive than the phosphodiester oligonucleotides. To avoid these problems, we attempted to improve the properties of the phosphodiester oligonucleotide by complexation with cyclodextrin supermolecules. We compared the biological activity of the phosphodiester antisense oligonucleotide (O \u00c0 oligo) either free or complexed with native b-CD and -CD or b-cyclodextrin derivatives. When the O \u00c0 oligo is complexed either with native b-, g-CD, or with a 7(ethane-diamino)-b-CD derivative, 50% decrease in viral multiplication is observed. The inhibition is higher (75%) after its complexation with S-Gal-b-CD or 7(S-Gal)-b-CD. Moreover, the antiviral activity of O \u00c0 oligo complexed with S-Gal-b-CD is improved to 90% if the complexation is performed in the [O \u00c0 oligo-CD] molar ratio of [1:100; 7.5 mM: 750 mM]. The same level of inhibition is obtained in presence of 25 mM of S \u00c0 oligo, a concentration three fold up to that used in the complex.",

We checked that the chemical modi\u00aecation of b-CD does not induce any cyclodextrin antiviral nor anticellular effect. S-Gal-b-CD induces no inhibitory effect on the viral multiplication at the concentrations used for the preparation of the complexes. Moreover, assays to measure cell viability show no cytotoxic action of the cyclodextrins. These observations exclude the possibility that the antiviral activity obtained with the [O \u00c0 oligo-S-Gal-b-CD] complexes is due to an effect of the S-Gal-b-CD itself.",

            "text": "From these results it might be concluded that the complexation of the oligonucleotide with the cyclodextrins protect the O \u00c0 oligo from its degradation by the nucleases perhaps by protecting the phosphodiester group. Cellular uptake studies recently reported that the\u00afuorescent intensity of (FITC)conjugated phosphorothioate oligonucleotides was greatly increased when the oligonucleotide was complexed with cyclodextrin derivatives, indicating that complexation increases cellular uptake [65] . In our case it might be expected that the chemical modi\u00aecation of the native b-CD by substitution of the hydroxyl of the primary alcohol of one glucose unit on the ring with a thiogalactose residue improves the cellular uptake of the O \u00c0 oligo by a ligand-carbohydrate cell receptors interaction. As the surface of numerous normal and malignant eukaryotic cells are covered with galactose-speci\u00aec lectins, galactose-substituted b-CD might be used as drug carriers for targeting oligonucleotides in vivo. Another possibility which may also contribute to the enhancement of the antiviral activity of O \u00c0 oligo complexed to cyclodextrin is that the complexation could modify the intracellular distribution of the antisense oligonucleotide. Probably oligonucleotide-cyclodextrin complexes enter the cells by a process different from endocytosis pathway in which the oligonucleotides may be trapped within endosomal or lysosomal vesicles. Further studies have to be achieved to study the intracellular distribution of oligonucleotide after treatment with [oligonucleotide-cyclodextrin] complexes and to elucidate the mechanism of the interaction between the oligodeoxynucleotide and cyclodextrin.",
