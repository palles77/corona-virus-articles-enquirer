Numerous infectious and noninfectious causes of diarrhea in newborn and growing foals exist. Unfortunately, determination of a specific etiology in individual cases continues to be difficult because of our incomplete understanding of normal flora and limitations in available diagnostic tests. The isolation of an organism from the feces of foals with diarrhea may not directly indicate that that agent causes the diarrhea. Clostridiumperfringens biotype A, Rhodococcus equi, Bacteroides {ragilis, and rotavirus are examples of potential enteric pathogens that may be recovered from the feces in the absence of disease.",

Affected foals are typically aged between 6 and 12 days of age and have a nonfetid, lowvolume stool that varies in consistency from soft to watery. The pH of the feces is alkaline. The diarrhea is nondebilitating, and foals remain bright and alert with a good appetite. The basis of foal heat diarrhea is not certain, but likely it is a response to developmental changes within the intestinal tract. The temporal association between coprophagy, the appearance of protozoa in the feces, and the onset of diarrhea implies that the syndrome occurs in response to establishment of intestinal flora. The diarrhea does not appear to be associated with alterations in milk composition, maternal estrus, or parasite infection. Anecdotal reports suggest that the feeding of probiotic preparations may reduce the incidence of foal heat diarrhea.",

However, the quality of commercial milk replacement solutions has improved over recent years, such that diarrhea is uncommon if the milk is prepared and fed as per the manufacturer's instructions. The feeding of overly dilute or concentrated milk will often cause diarrhea. Many of the commercial replacement products have a greater caloric density than mare's milk, thus necessitating feeding at a volume less than 20% to 25% bodyweight daily. The use of bovine milk is problematic in that it often causes diarrhea and ill-thrift, probably because of its relatively greater proportion of fat. Formulations that use lowfat cow's milk with dextrose have been used with some success. The low complication rate associated with the use of goat's milk is paradoxic given that it has a similar total fat content to bovine milk. The exceptions are mild metabolic derangements seen in some foals and occasional constipation. The fat in goat's milk is more highly emulsified and may be more readily digested by foals.",

This form occurs rarely in foals. In contrast, secondary intolerance is a contributing factor to the diarrhea associated with many small intestinal infections. Lactose intolerance should be suspected when diarrhea resolves after withdrawal of milk and then returns when milk is reintroduced. Confirmation is by lactose tolerance test. Briefly, lactose is administered at a dose rate of 1 gm/kg (20% w/v solution) after a 2-hour fast. Blood is sampled before lactose administration and then at IS-minute intervals for 60 minutes. In normal foals the blood glucose concentration should increase by a minimum of 25 mg/dl within 30 minutes. In lactase-deficient foals, glucose rarely increases above 30 mg/dl, Supplementation with lactase (Lactaid caplets or drops [McNeil-PPC, Inc., Ft. Washington, Pa.] ; 6000-9000 FCC units every 3 to 6 hours) may have benefit in cases of primary lactose intolerance.",

Clinical signs are more variable but may include transient bloody stool, colic, and fever. Mortality is less than with disease induced by biotype C. The role of biotype A is often confounded because it appears to be commonly present in the feces of healthy young foals as early as 24 hours of age. It is not uncommon for this biotype to produce an enterotoxin (CPE) that can be identified with a commercial fecal assay.Several factors confound the interpretation of this test. Firstly, the toxin is rapidly degraded in fecal samples, and delays in processing will frequently yield a negative result. Secondly, C. perfringens species other than biotype A can produce enterotoxin. Lastly, recent information indicates that many biotype A isolates from foals lack the gene to produce enterotoxin. Currently, the most appropriate method of diagnosis involves signalment and clinical signs. Large numbers of Gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria are seen on fecal Gram stain. Spore stains can be requested but rarely provide useful additional data. The isolation of C. perftingens biotype A from feces or blood culture increases the accuracy of diagnosis. All C. perfringens isolates contain an alpha toxin. Further separation into biotypes A through E is based on identification of additional toxins produced by the bacteria. The exception is a C. perfringens isolate that contains the alpha toxin and a [32 toxin. This organism has been isolated from both adult horses and foals with diarrhea. The future development of commercial fecal toxin tests for 0., [31, and [32 toxins would provide a clearer insight into the role of C. perftingens biotypes in neonatal diarrhea.",

The isolation of C. difficile is usually considered significant in foals of all ages, but it is not uncommon to identify foals that are culture positive but toxin negative by ELISA.

The foal may appear healthy and show signs of mild abdominal discomfort, or it may experience extreme pain and exhibit signs of endotoxic and hypovolemic shock. Resuscitation should be started immediately for the critical foal before or concurrently with diagnostic testing. A colicky foal is more difficult to evaluate than an adult horse; foals are less tolerant of abdominal pain, and the degree of pain exhibited does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the abdominal lesion. Although rectal palpation cannot be used, abdominal radiography and ultrasonography are very useful tools for evaluating foals with colic. A tentative diagnosis often can be obtained from a thorough history and physical examination. Diagnostic tests-such as venous blood gases, complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry pro-file, serum IgG, nasogastric intubation, peritoneal paracentesis, abdominal radiography and ultrasonography, and gastroscopy and duodenoscopy-can provide additional information. Treatment ranges from careful monitoring and medical therapy to surgical intervention.",

Meconium is composed of glandular secretions from the gastrointestinal tract, amniotic fluid, and cellular debris and should be passed by 48 hours of age.
