            "text": "Two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detecting Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Dublin antibodies in bulk milk were developed and evaluated for potential use in control programs. The ELISAs were based on either lipopolysacharide (LPS ELISA) or flagellar antigen (GP ELISA). Sensitivity was determined with 79 case herds with a wide range of clinical signs. Specificity was determined with 125 Dutch and 200 Swedish control herds. The relation between antibodies in bulk milk, antibodies in serum, and the level of milk production of individual cows was studied with 61 case herds. The optimal optical density (OD) values of the LPS ELISA and the GP ELISA were determined to be 0.2 and 0.5, respectively. The sensitivities of the LPS ELISA and the GP ELISA were 54 and 63%, respectively, with a specificity of 98% for both ELISAs with samples from the Dutch control herds. The specificities for samples from the Swedish herds were 100% for the LPS ELISA and 95% for the GP ELISA. The sensitivity of the combination of tests was 65% when samples were run in parallel, and the specificity was 100% when samples were run in series, irrespective of whether the samples came from Dutch or Swedish control herds. The variance (R 2 ) in the OD value for bulk milk samples could be explained by the percentage of seropositive lactating cows in a herd with the LPS ELISA for 51% of the samples and with the GP ELISA for 72%. The variance in the OD value was best explained by the combination of the percentage of seropositive lactating cows in the herd and the mean log 10 serum antibody titer for that herd (R 2 \u202b\u060d\u202c 62% for the LPS ELISA and R 2 \u202b\u060d\u202c 75% for the GP ELISA). Case herds more often tested negative by the ELISA with bulk milk when the percentage of seropositive lactating cows was less than 5%. It is concluded that both ELISAs with bulk milk can be used in control programs to distinguish between infected and noninfected herds. Specificity can be increased by using the two tests in combination. Sensitivity was relatively low for both single tests and both tests combined.",

Sensitivity was defined as the proportion of bulk milk samples that tested positive (with an OD value equal to or above the cutoff value) among the case herds. Specificity was defined as the proportion of bulk milk samples that tested negative (with an OD value below the cutoff value) among the control herds (12) . Cutoff values were evaluated with respect to sensitivity, specificity, and differential positivity rate (DPR) (9) . Optimal cutoff values were defined as those with a specificity of at least 98% because a lower specificity would lead to an unacceptable number of false-positive reactions in control programs. Statistical significance was defined at P equal to 0.05. Differences in sensitivities and specificities between the two ELISAs were tested by McNemar's chi-square test for paired data (3) . The sensitivities and specificities of the two ELISAs were further evaluated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and by calculation of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) (4) .",

(7), who found a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 95% with 10 case herds and 20 control herds. Wedderkopp (27) also reported a higher sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 89%. The relatively low sensitivities of the ELISAs used in our study may be the consequence of the selection criteria used for the case herds, the time of sampling, and the cutoff values chosen for the tests. The severities of clinical symptoms and the ages of the diseased animals were not included as selection criteria. The only selection criterion for the case herds in this study was a single bacteriological culture positive for serovar Dublin, irrespective of whether the positive sample came from a lactating animal or a nonlactating animal. Selection of only those herds with lactating cows in which clinical symptoms occurred would certainly influence the test results (26a). Sampling of blood and bulk milk sampling occurred 2 to 4 months after the first serovar Dublinpositive sample was detected. It is possible that no antibodies were detected because antibody titers can decrease rapidly in seropositive cows (21, 26) or because seropositive cows were culled shortly after infection. The rate of detection of infected herds therefore can possibly be increased by more frequent sampling (28) . The cutoff values of the LPS ELISA and GP ELISA for bulk milk samples were determined with a specificity of at least 98%. This specificity is consistent with the common practice of defining the cutoff value as the mean plus 2 or 3 standard deviations for the negative control group (18) . A disadvantage of this approach is that it assumes that the results for the negative control group have a normal distribution, whereas the results for the control herds in our study were not normally distributed. Another disadvantage is that the test results for the case herds are neglected. Selection of the cutoff value by using the DPR has the advantage that it combines the test results for the control and case herds. A disadvantage of this approach is that it aims for the highest value, irrespective of the purpose of the test and of the consequence of falsepositive and false-negative reactions. In control programs that emphasize the certification of herds as being free of serovar Dublin, a higher cutoff value can be chosen to increase the specificity, resulting in fewer false-positive reactions. In control programs that emphasize the identification of infected herds, a lower cutoff value can be chosen to increase the sensitivity, resulting in fewer false-negative reactions.",

The reason for this is that earlier studies found unexpectedly high titers in milk during the first 14 days after parturition (20) and more false-positive reactions in control herds (7) . In addition, in control programs for serovar Dublin it is expected that serum will be used more frequently than milk for the detection of carrier animals because carriers are not always lactating. Further research is needed to evaluate the use of ELISAs with bulk milk in relation to the presence of carrier animals.",

Control programs for Salmonella are especially important if carriers of Salmonella are present. The observation that the LPS ELISA with bulk milk detected positive samples more often when one or more lactating cows had a serum antibody titer higher than the cutoff value is therefore interesting because carriers of serovar Dublin often have a high serum antibody titer (26) . Introduction of the percentage of milk produced by seropositive cows did not further increase the percentage of the variance in the OD value that was explained. This may be because the overall difference in the volume of milk produced between seropositive and seronegative cows was small.",

The actual use of such ELISAs in a control program depends on the test characteristics of the ELISAs in combination with the true prevalence of the infection in a country or region. In The Netherlands, serovar Dublin is estimated to be present in 5 to 10% of the dairy herds (unpublished observations). At this prevalence, the number of false-positive reactions will be relatively high compared with the number of true-positive reactions if the specificity of the test or combination of tests is lower than 100%. We found a specificity of 98.4% for both ELISAs for the Dutch control herds with the cutoff values that had been determined. Use of a combination of the two ELISAs in our study increased the specificity to 100% without a significant decrease in sensitivity, although the number of samples tested was small. With samples from the Swedish control herds, the specificity of the LPS ELISA was 100% and that of the GP ELISA was 94.5%. Use of a combination of the two tests would give a specificity of 100%. It is possible to increase the rate of detection of serovar Dublin-infected herds by using an ELISA with bulk milk in combination with serology for young calves (26a).",
