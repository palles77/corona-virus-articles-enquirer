In a previous study we determined that the target antigen was an N-linked glycoprotein that was present both in the envelope of BV and in the plasma membrane of infected cells during virus budding (Volkman et aL, i Author to whom requests for reprints should be addressed. 1984). A question generated (but which remained unanswered) by that study was why the immunoprecipitation of solubilized, [35S]methionine-labeled BV yielded four bands (one major band of 64,000 Da and three minor bands of 127,000, 59,000, and 49,000 Da) instead of just one band by SDS-PAGE autoradiography.",

By varying postimmunoprecipitation sample preparation conditions we obtained evidence that the 49K and 59K bands were breakdown products of the 64K protein (BVGP 64), and that the 127K bands were composed of dimers of BVGP 64. Under nonreducing conditions higher-molecularweight oligomers of BVGP 64 (trimers and tetramers) could be detected in addition to dimers. We obtained evidence that BVGP 64 was an acidic phosphoprotein with an isoelectric point of 3.15. Additionally it was discovered that the BVGP 296   VOLKMAN  AND  GOLDSMITH   64 epitope reactive with the neutralizing  monoclonal  antibody was destroyed by  interaction with SDS. This effect could account for the lack of neutralizing activity of antiserum made to SDS-PAGE purified BVGP 64. MATERIALS AND METHODS Virus and cells. All studies were conducted with Spodoptera frugipwda IPLB-SF-21 cells grown at 28\" in BML-TC/lO medium (Gardiner and Stockdale, 1970) with 10% fetal calf serum.

Previous experiments that had yielded four bands upon radioimmune precipitation with AcVl were done under conditions of boiling the precipitated antigen for 10 min in sample buffer, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS and 3% 2-ME before being loaded onto 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE gels (Volkman et aL, 1984) . We examined the effect of varying the chemical environment and the time of boiling on the number and intensity of the bands obtained. Samples were boiled for 3 min or longer in pH 6.8 sample buffer with or without 3% 2-ME, or were heated to 100\" or incubated at room temperature for 3 min in pH 2.3 sample buffer with or without 3% 2-ME. The results of these treatments are shown in Fig. 1 . The 64K band was prominent in all cases, and the 127K band was visible, although faintly so, in all conditions tested except for boiling in pH 2.3 sample buffer with 3% 2-ME (Fig. 1 , lane C). In contrast, the appearance of the 59K and 49K bands was highly dependent upon the sample preparation conditions, with the appearance of both being favored by boiling in sample buffer of pH 2.3 ( Fig. 1, lanes C and D) . Antigens released by the acid environment of this same sample buffer without being boiled contained no detectable 59K band and only traces of the 49K protein (lanes E and F). In sample buffer of pH 6.8, samples boiled in the presence of 2-ME contained a heavier 49K band than those boiled in the absence of 2-ME (compare lanes A and B). Extended boiling times also favored the appearance of the 49K protein (compare lanes G, H, and I). The appearance of various peptides less than 49K also depended on sample preparation conditions, as is evident in (A) through (F). solubilized BV protein samples were treated various ways before SDS-PAGE on 10% gels: resuspended in pH 6.8 sample buffer with 3% 2-ME (A) or without 2-ME (B) and boiled 3 min; resuspended in pH 2.3 sample buffer with 3% 2-ME (C, E) or without 2-ME (D, F), and boiled 3 min (C, D), or not boiled (E, F); resuspended in pH 6.8 sample buffer with 3% 2-ME and boiled 3 min (G), 5 min (H), or 10 min (I). In (A)-(F) approximately 20 pg presolubilized BV per well and lo-day exposure period were used. In (G)-(I), 12.5 pg presolubilized BV and a 5 day-exposure period were used.",

To accomplish this we added alkylating agent IA (0.075 M) to pH 6.8 sample buffer in place of the standard 2-ME, and observed bands with apparent molecular weights of 64K, 129K, 172K, and 229K upon SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2 , lane C). Controls of nonimmunoprecipitated solubilized virus 100,000 Q supernate were included to confirm that the higher-molecular-weight bands were not aggregates somehow caused by IA, but were present in the 100,000 g supernatant sample fraction (Fig. 2, lane B) . Both the nonimmu- noprecipitated and the IA-treated highermolecular-weight protein bands were sensitive to 2-ME and disappeared in its presence with no other heavily labeled bands appearing to take their place other than the 64K band (Fig. 2, lanes A and  F) . An attempt was made to determine whether these higher-molecular-weight aggregates were intact in the presolubilized virus or if they aggregated after solubilization by pretreating labeled virus with IA for 30 min at room temperature, and solubilizing in its presence for 2 hr at 4' before immunoprecipitation.",

This observation and others led to the speculation that the integrity of the target epitope of the neutralizing AcVl might be dependent upon the association of at least two proteins or peptide chains, with the 64K protein being at least one of the components. Alternatively, it was reasoned, the neutralizing epitope was destroyed by the Laemmli gel sample preparation conditions. The evidence presented in the previous sections, suggesting that BVGP 64 could be present as multimers in the virion (perhaps forming the peplomers) presented the further possibility that the multimeric form of BVGP 64 might be the functional target of neutralizing AcVl. It was of interest, therefore, to determine whether the antiserum to SDS-PAGE purified BVGP 64 could recognize multimers of BVGP 64, whether AcVi could recognize reduced and alkylated BVGP 64, and what component of the Laemmli protein disruption treatment destroyed the AcVi recognition (neutralizing) epitope. The experiment designed to answer these questions was simply to preboil the 100,000 g supernatant fraction of [35S]methionine-labeled, solubilized BV for 3 min with 0.075 M IA, 1% SDS, or 3% 2-ME followed by 0.075 M IA, and immunoprecipitate using either AcVi or antiserum to BVGP 64.

It was determined that the 49K and 59K bands were generated by postimmunoprecipitation sample preparation conditions such as heating to 100\" (especially at pH 2.3), and that exposure to 2-ME exaggerated the effects of heating. That the 64K protein can be degraded by the combined effects of 2-ME and boiling was confirmed by the observation of breakdown products by a second PAGE analysis of PAGE-purified 64K protein (Fig. 3) . Boiling in IA, and boiling at pH 2.3 led to the generation of numerous other bands in addition to the four first observed (Figs. 1 and 4). These types of effects, that is, the generation of anomalous bands on SDS-PAGE gels by heating to lOO\", especially in the presence of 2-ME, have been described before for a coronavirus envelope protein (Sturman, 1977) . The significance of these observed effects with regard to baculovirology in general is that care must be taken in evaluating molecular weights and numbers of proteins observed by SDS-PAGE, both with and without subsequent autoradiography or Western blotting. (The effects, of course, are exaggerated with the more sensitive detection techniques.) It is quite possible that many of the observed bands, even though they are consistently obtained, may be due to protein -degradation or aggregation, or both. Effects such as these could account for the reaction of multiple bands with individual monoclonal antibodies in Western blots of viral structural proteins, such as described by Hohmann and Faulkner (1983) .",

BVGP 64 is important in the infectivity of AcNPV BV as it is the target of neutralizing antibody AcVi. Its biological function, however, is still unknown at this time. It is likely that BVGP 64 composes the peplomers seen projecting from BV envelopes, though this by no means is firmly established. The occluded phenotype of AcNPV also has a 64K structural phosphoprotein (Maruniak and Summers, 1981) . It is doubtful that this protein is the same as BVGP 64, however, because it does not appear to be a glycoprotein (Stiles and Wood, 1983) , and it does not react with any of four monoclonal antibodies (AcV1, AcV5, AcVs, and AcVJ reactive with BVGP 64 (Hohmann and Faulkner, 1983) . This point must be examined more thoroughly, however, before any firm conclusions are drawn.",
