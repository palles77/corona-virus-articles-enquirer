With the discovery of antibiotics in the early twentieth century and the successful eradication of smallpox in 1979, it seemed that humanity was about to finally rid itself of infectious diseases. During the past couple of decades, however, microbes have shown a tenacious ability to adapt, re-adapt, survive and challenge human ingenuity (table 1) .",

Mass migrations, trade and travel are notoriously effective at spreading infectious diseases to even the most remote parts of the globe (table 2) . Mass migrations are often the result of emergency situations such as floods, wars, famines or earthquakes, and can create precarious conditions-such as poor hygiene and nutrition or risky sexual behaviours-which hasten the spread of infectious diseases. global trade and travel introduce new pathogens into previously virgin regions, where the diseases find a more vulnerable population and can develop into epidemics; this was the case, for example, in the late 1990s, when West nile virus arrived in new york city, from where it quickly spread throughout north america. in the present-day global village, the next rabies or Ebola epidemic could occur anywhere in the world.",

Moreover, the misuse and overuse of antibiotics is eroding our ability to control even common infections. Many bacteria have become resistant to even the most powerful antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics; similarly, the once first-line drugs against malaria are now almost useless. p romiscuous sexual behaviour and substance abuse remain the main means of transmission of blood-borne infectious diseases such as HiV and hepatitis. in areas of extreme poverty, given the increased resort to the sex trade for survival, sexual transmission of these diseases is accelerated. in many developing countries, commercial sex workers and long-distance truck drivers have contributed greatly to the spread of such infectious diseases from one community to another. in addition, institutional settings-such as child-care centres, hospitals and homes for the elderlyprovide an ideal environment for the transmission of infectious diseases because they bring susceptible individuals into close contact with one another.",

Finally, public-health experts also worry that global climate change could contribute further to the spread of both pathogens and their vectors such as mosquitoes or birds, as their migratory patterns and normal habitats are likely to change. t he burden of infectious disease is therefore likely to aggravate, and in some cases even provoke, further economic decay, social fragmentation and political destabilization, especially in the developing world and former communist countries. as of the year 2001, one billion people lived on less than uS$1 per day. countries with a per capita income of less than uS$500 per year spend, on average, uS$12 per person per year on health. according to the World Health organization (WHo), infectious diseases caused 32% of deaths worldwide, 68% of deaths in africa and 37% of deaths in Southeast asia (WHo, 1999) . these diseases account for 90% of the health problems worldwide and kill about 14 million people annually, 90% of whom are from the sp e c i a l i s su e developing world. they have killed more people than famine, war, accidents and crimes together. aiDS, tB and malaria are increasingly being acknowledged as important factors in the political and economic destabilization of the developing world. However, the developed world is not spared either. as of the year 2000, the number of annual deaths owing to infectious diseases was estimated at roughly 170,000 in the uSa (gordon, 2000) . HiV and pneumonia/ influenza are among the 10 leading causes of death in the uSa. at present, approximately one million americans are infected with HiV. the WHo estimates that 33.4 million people have contracted HiV worldwide since the beginning of the epidemic in 1983 and about 2.3 million of these died in the year 1998 alone. in the uSa and many other countries, aiDS is now the leading cause of death among young adults (Fauci et al, 1996) . the united nations Joint programme on HiV/aiDS (unaiDS; geneva, Switzerland) estimates that another 115 million people will die by 2015 in the 60 countries most affected by aiDS (unaiDS, 2006) . the economic costs of infectious diseases-especially HiV/aiDS and malariaare significant. their increasing toll on productivity owing to deaths and chronic debilitating illnesses, reduced profitability and decreased foreign investment, has had a serious effect on the economic growth of some poor countries. according to the WHo, the economic value of the loss-of-life owing to HiV/aiDS in 1999 was estimated at about 12% of the gross national product (gnp) in sub-Saharan african countries, and the virus could reduce the gross domestic product of some by 20% or more by 2010.",

Health must therefore be regarded as a major economic factor and investments in health as a profitable business. a ccording to the WHo, tB affects working hours in formal and informal economies, as well as within households (WHo, 2008) . country studies document that each tB patient loses, on average, 3-4 months of work time annually due to the disease, and lost earnings amount to 20-30% of household income. Families of people who die from the disease lose approximately 15 years of income. the global burden of tB in economic terms can therefore be easily calculated: given 8.4 million patients yearly according to the most recent WHo estimates (Kim et al, 2008) , the majority of whom are potential wage-earners, and assuming a 30% decline in average productivity, the toll amounts to approximately uS$1 billion each year. In addition to affecting the health of individuals directly, infectious diseases are also having an impact on whole societies, economies and political systems science & society sp e cial issue annual deaths are estimated at two million and, with an average loss of 15 years of income per death, there is an additional deficit of uS$11 billion. Every 12 months, tB therefore causes roughly uS$12 billion to disappear from the global economy. the social cost of the lost productivity further increases the burden on society. By contrast, a 50% reduction in tB-related deaths would cost uS$900 million per year, but the return on investment by 2010 would be 22 million people cured, 16 million deaths averted and uS$6 billion saved.",

We need a global commitment to address the most prominent infectious diseases and to complement local initiatives with special attention to the least-developed countries (alilio, 2001; Stop tB partnership, 2006) . this will require analytical and advisory services in order to help countries generate and act on information about the status and dynamics of most infectious diseases, and to estimate their social and economic impact. Such information is essential for advocacy, and for making appropriate and timely decisions.",

Even from the purely economic point of view, the investment in the fight against infectious diseases is evidently good business: the world economy-and, subsequently, individual family economiesstands to benefit from such investments.
