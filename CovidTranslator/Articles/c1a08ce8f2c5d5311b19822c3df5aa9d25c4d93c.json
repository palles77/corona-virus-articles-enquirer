Since February 20, authorities have reported more than 70,000 confirmed cases and 2,122 deaths across all Chinese provinces. More than 26 countries or regions have reported confirmed cases. 8 With the number of confirmed cases increasing, the implementation of corresponding outbreak control policies began on January 23. By following these procedures, most cities have been controlled, except Wuhan; however, there have been outbreaks in countries outside China. 9 Some articles have reported the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in Wuhan 10-13 , but other cities have rarely been reported. Clinical manifestations do not vary widely, but the epidemiology may be different from region to region. We analyzed the epidemiology of 213 COVID-19 patients admitted to the First People's Hospital of Jingmen, which admitted all the confirmed patients within the municipal districts (not including county or county-level cities) of Jingmen, a city of Hubei about 250 miles away from Wuhan.",

These numbers indicate that COVID-19 is more contagious than SARS 19 and, without protection, people can get infected easily by eating together, shopping, meeting, talking, and staying in crowded places. This is the first descriptive study of the epidemiology of COVID-19 in a city outside Wuhan. A total of 213 patients in Jingmen have provided the opportunity for the whole process of COVID-19, from outbreak to control, to be studied in a single district.Most confirmed patients are between the ages of 27-68, there was no difference between genders, it's similar to the whole cases in china, 20 which suggests that all humans are sensitive to COVID-19;",
