By using systems-scale network analysis, we identify repertoires of cellular transcriptional pathways that lead to and underlie distinct patterns of asthma exacerbation. Specifically, in both virus-associated and nonviral exacerbations, we demonstrate a set of core exacerbation modules, among which epithelial-associated SMAD3 signaling is upregulated and lymphocyte response pathways are downregulated early in exacerbation, followed by later upregulation of effector pathways including epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, extracellular matrix production, mucus hypersecretion, and eosinophil activation. We show an additional set of multiple inflammatory cell pathways involved in virus-associated exacerbations, in contrast to squamous cell pathways associated with nonviral exacerbations. Our work introduces an in vivo molecular platform to investigate, in a clinical setting, both the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic targets to modify exacerbations.",

It has been established that the majority of exacerbations are provoked by viral respiratory infections, most notably rhinoviruses (RVs); however, exacerbations also occur in the absence of infections 1,2 . Furthermore, even in children with severe asthma, the majority of respiratory infections do not progress to exacerbation 3 . The fundamental question of why some but not all colds lead to exacerbations has not been fully answered, and the similarities and differences between the mechanism(s) of virus-associated and nonviral exacerbations are unknown. Identifying the molecular pathways underlying progression from colds to exacerbations has the potential to improve understanding of the mechanisms of these events and, from this information, to target therapeutic strategies more precisely and effectively.",

We have therefore performed the first study in asthma that uses transcriptome network analysis in a case-control, longitudinal study design. In our study, we prospectively evaluated a cohort of children with high disease burden. We combined nasal virus PCR, nasal and peripheral blood cell differentials, and nasal and blood RNA-seq for serial sample collections at baseline and longitudinally during episodes when participants reported cold symptoms to determine the key molecular pathways associated with subsequent asthma exacerbations.

Gene expression levels measured in nasal samples were associated with percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, respiratory epithelial cells (termed 'epithelium'), and/or squamous epithelial cells (termed 'squamous') in nasal samples. Gene expression levels measured in peripheral blood were associated with percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and/or basophils in peripheral blood. By applying this modular framework, we compared Ex + and Exevents to identify immune pathways underlying asthma exacerbations. Expression patterns in 13 nasal modules were statistically significantly associated with exacerbations at false-discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, 11 of which had increased expression in Ex + events and 2 of which had decreased expression ( Table 2 ); 6 of these modules had FDR < 0.001 ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 2a ). In contrast, there were no significant differences in expression for the blood modules. The comparison was adjusted for cell percentages and the presence or absence Fig. 3 ) but were not different between the Ex + and Exgroups. Our results therefore suggest that the observed differences are predominantly due to changes in gene expression in specific cell types as opposed to changes in cell population composition. Each of the differentially expressed modules represents a significant protein-protein interaction network (enrichment P < 0.001) that includes important known asthma-associated genes but also demonstrates a much broader functional network ( Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 2b ). We annotated the most significant exacerbation-upregulated module as the epithelial-associated 'SMAD3-related cell differentiation' module, which was associated with epithelium and squamous percentages. It contains 46 genes that form a network centered around the transcription factor SMAD3 and includes other transcription factors and signaling molecules induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 signaling, including KLF4, FZD1, and FZD5, as well as genes involved in wound healing and epithelial differentiation. The second most significant upregulated module was annotated as 'eosinophil activation/mucus hypersecretion' . It contains 69 genes and was associated with eosinophil, epithelium, and squamous percentages; it includes the key epithelial mucin associated with hypersecretion, MUC5AC 15 , the respiratory epithelial proliferation marker KRT8 16 , the eosinophil surface activation/survival molecule CD9 17 , and the eosinophil transcription factor IKZF2 18 . FGFR2, a receptor implicated in dysregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal signaling in asthma 19 , represents the central-most gene within this module network. The third most significant upregulated module, 'extracellular matrix (ECM) production/cell membrane' , contains 209 genes and includes the asthma-associated collagen COL1A1 20 , the membrane molecules CAV1 and CFTR, and the inducible nitric oxide synthase NOS2 21 . The core gene of this network is EPHA1, a tyrosine kinase linked to pulmonary inflammation 22 . This module was associated with epithelium and squamous percentages. The fourth most significant upregulated module, 'epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling/cell-cell adhesion' , contains 240 genes and represents an important pathway associated with lung fibrosis 23 and mucus secretion 24 . It forms a densely clustered network centered around EGFR and its homolog receptor ERBB2 and includes associated signaling molecules; it was associated with epithelium and squamous percentages.",

Events were subgrouped as V + Ex + (n = 33), In primary analysis, 13 (of 94 total) modules had significantly different expression when comparing the Ex + and Exevent groups in the full cohort (FDR < 0.05). Values correspond to the differences shown graphically in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2 . In secondary analysis, 20 modules had significantly different expression when comparing the V + Ex + , V + Ex -, V -Ex + , and V -Exsubgroups (ANOVA, FDR < 0.05). These results are subdivided into virus-associated exacerbation modules that had different expression in the V + Ex + and V + Exsubgroups and nonviral exacerbation modules that had different expression in the V -Ex + and V -Exsubgroups. Values correspond to the differences shown graphically in Supplementary Fig. 5 . Another five modules were significant in this comparison but only showed different expression between V + and Vevents with no difference according to exacerbation status; these modules are therefore excluded for brevity. The analysis included 247 unique nasal samples and 256 unique blood samples from 106 individuals who in total had 47 Ex + events and 107 Exevents. The event subgroups included 33 V + Ex + , 14 V -Ex + , 69 V + Ex -, and 38 V -Exevents.

This suggests a specific 'at-risk' immune state, when a child is highly susceptible to exacerbation. Furthermore, our results provide insight into conflicting data regarding antiviral IFN responses in asthma from earlier studies, in which some have shown relative deficiency in IFN responses 44, 45 whereas others have shown normal or excessive responses 46, 47 . Our data show that both observations may be valid; IFN responses may not be consistently diminished or elevated, but rather dysregulated. Low IFN signaling at baseline may enable viral replication and/or epithelial damage during the early phase of infection, which secondarily induces an exaggerated IFN response promoting exacerbation. We show that systemic corticosteroid treatment affects only a subset of exacerbation-associated pathways, in particular those related to eosinophil activation and mucus hypersecretion, type 2 inflammation, and epithelial SMAD3 signaling. The failure of corticosteroids to moderate other pathways, including EGFR signaling and ECM production, may help to explain why corticosteroid treatment has limited efficacy in preventing lung function decline 48 .

It is possible that we have missed aspects of the lower-airway inflammatory response by not directly sampling the lower airway during illness. However, the clear differences between Ex + and Exevents and the corresponding decrease in pulmonary functions suggest that our findings reflect molecular pathways directly relevant to the pathophysiology of exacerbations. Paired upper-and lower-airway samples collected in future work can build upon our results.

Finally, we have developed a new sample collection and analysis platform that can be readily integrated into translational asthma research. Collectively, we anticipate that these approaches will advance understanding of both the efficacy of current and novel intervention strategies and unresponsiveness to these strategies in some treated individuals, thereby leading to a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of asthma exacerbations and how to prevent and treat them.",

All STRING interaction sources were used, and a minimum interaction score or 0.15 was required for a gene to be included within a network. An interaction network was significant if its protein-protein interaction enrichment P value was <0.05, meaning it had more interactions than expected from a set of proteins of the same size drawn randomly from the human genome. Cytoscape version 3.5.1 66 was used to draw interaction networks according to a prefuse forcedirected layout by using the combined interaction score exported from STRING. The size of each gene was made proportional to the number of interactions in the network as a percentage of the maximum number of interactions for any node in that network.

For participants who did not experience an exacerbation during the study, time to exacerbation was censored to the length of enrollment in the study. Two individuals reported an exacerbation at a later time on the same day as visit 0 and so were excluded from this analysis. Forward stepwise regression was performed with only the significant modules from the univariate analysis in comparison to the time to exacerbation. We selected the model providing the lowest Akaike information criterion that had significant P values for each beta coefficient, which was a linear combination of two modules. Samples were divided into quartiles according to their scaled combined expression value for the two modules. A Kaplan-Meier curve showing the exacerbation probability over time was fit to the data splitting individuals according to quartile. The lower three quartiles overlapped and were each significantly different from the top quartile, and they were therefore combined. For comparison, a Kaplan-Meier curve was generated on the basis of FEV 1 predicted (%) split at 80% or split by quartile. For the Kaplan-Meier curves, time was censored at 100 d for display purposes, but the results are similar when using the entire length of follow-up.",
