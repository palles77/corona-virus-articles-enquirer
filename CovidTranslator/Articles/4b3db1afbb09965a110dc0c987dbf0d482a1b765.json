We postulate that these two interleukins may participate in the early phase of TBE and NB. The aim of the study was to measure serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of ICAM-1, IL-21 and IL-23 in patients with TBE and NB before treatment and to assess their usefulness in the diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory process in TBE and NB. Methods: Forty-three patients hospitalized in The were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups: TBE, NB and CG. Pre-treatment blood and CSF samples were obtained from all patients. ELISA kits (DRG Instruments, Germany) were used to measure the concentration of IL-21, IL-23 and sICAM-1. Results: Significant differences between TBE/CG and NB/CG concentration of sICAM-1 were found only in the CSF. CSF IL-21 levels in NB were lower than in TBE. In TBE, a strong negative correlation between CSF concentration of IL-21 and IL-23 and monocyte count in CSF was observed. Negative correlation between IL-21 in CSF and neutrophil count was also noted. Serum IL-23 correlated positively with leukocytes and platelet count in serum. In NB, a strong positive correlation between serum IL-21 and platelet count and negative correlation between IL-21 in serum and CSF with pleocytosis was observed. Conclusions: Increased sICAM-1 concentration in TBE and NB may be a proof of brain-blood barrier disturbances in the early phase of these diseases. IL-21 and IL-23 do not appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of the early stages of TBE and NB.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is composed of tight junctions within the capillary endothelium. Normal BBB maintains a unique microenvironment within the central nervous system (CNS) [2] . The early stage of inflammation involves adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes across the BBB to the normally isolated CNS. This process is regulated by the expression of adhesion molecules. One of the most well-known components is the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). It has been described as a ligand for the membrane-bound integrin receptors for the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and monocyte adhesion molecules-1 (Mac-1) on leukocytes. It is involved in the adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes. Some studies have demonstrated ICAM-1 upregulation in many tissues after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Recent studies tend to focus on its effects on brain tissues in acute diseases, but neglect possible differences between the brain and the spinal cord following traumatic lesions. Yang et al. demonstrated the upregulation of ICAM-1, LFA-1, and Mac-1 in the spinal cords of LPS intraspinal injected rats, and the location of ICAM-1 in microglia cells. These results suggest a possible role of this molecule in microglia-mediated immune response and antigen presenting in CNS immune diseases [3] .",

It shares the common gamma-chain with IL-2, IL-4 and IL-15, but in addition it also binds to the unique IL-21R alpha chain and activates JAK/STAT pathway. IL-21 influences the proliferation of T cells and B cells into memory cells and differentiates plasma cells to augment the activity of natural killer cells. It regulates the innate and acquired immune response. IL-21 contributes to the differentiation of the na\u00efve T lymphocytes to strongly proinflammatory Th17 cells and is implicated in immune-inflammatory diseases [4] . The presence of IL-21 and IL-6 may decide about the T cells differentiation towards Th17 phenotype rather than immunoregulatory T reg phenotype, defining the type of response to a given antigen. Th17 cells secrete IL-21 themselves, creating a possible positive feedback mechanism.",

Codolo et al. identified borrelial NapA protein as a factor inducing synthesis of IL-23 in human monocytes and neutrophils. Antibodies against NapA are detected in serum of 48% of patients with Lyme arthritis and Th lymphocytes from synovial fluid of patients with Lyme arthritis react specifically to NapA with release of IL-17A, suggesting the response to this protein is essential in developing Th17-like inflammation in Lyme arthritis [8] .",

ICAM-1 binds to its leukocyte ligands and allows activated leuko-cytes entry into the CNS [11] . Doerck et al. suggest, that adhesion molecules are not only important for capture and migration of pro-inflammatory T cells into the central nervous system, but also permit access of anti-inflammatory cells, such as regulatory T cells. Therefore it is likely to assume that intervention at the BBB is time related and could result in different therapeutic outcomes depending on the phase of CNS lesion development [12] .",

Th1 lymphocytes cross the BBB and may produce soluble forms of ICAM-1, which secondarily disturb BBB and increase the inflammatory process in CSF [16, 17] . Henningson et al. proved that Th1 response dominates in early phase of NB [18] . Th1 pathway predominates in early TBE but then Th2 type immune prevails [19] . These observations agree with the results of our study (increased ICAM-1 concentration in CSF in the early phase of TBE and NB). The role of IL-21 and IL-23 has been proven in many autoimmune diseases such as MS and lupus erythematosus. These interleukins are involved in neutrophils and monocytes recruitment to CSF through the BBB. Thus they are responsible for inducing the inflammatory process in the CNS in the course of autoimmune diseases. Lymphocytes produce specific cytokines, depending on their competence and role in inflammation. Th17 cytokines includes proinflammatory interleukins (IL)-17, 6, 21, 22, 23 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a. It suggests their important role in the immunopathogenesis of MS as the neuroinflammatory reaction is a prominent feature of this disease [20] . In the course of TBE CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells display different localization. Compared to CD8+ T cells, considerably greater numbers of CD4+ T cells are retained within the perivascular spaces. In contrast CD8+ T cells have a higher affinity for parenchyma [21] .",
