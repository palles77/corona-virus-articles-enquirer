Regulation, typically in the form of incentive based price caps, often applies to aviation infrastructure, such as major airports and air navigation services. At the same time, the demand for aviation infrastructure services is uncertain and subject to external shocks. Two case studies in economic regulation of aviation infrastructure are examined. They cover a period of volatile demand associated with the collapse of a major domestic airline which coincided with the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US. One case study involves the application of price caps to newly privatized airports during 1997e2002. The other case study examines the development of a long term price path for air navigation services over 2002 to 2004. The case studies illustrate the important role played by regulatory design. The paper concludes that the design of the regulatory framework has an important role in ameliorating the risks associated with uncertainty.",

In common with other infrastructure industries, aviation infrastructure has relatively high costs in comparison to demand. As airports are capital intensive and subject to indivisibilities, there is generally a single airport, or only a few airports, in a given geographic region. Competitive influences on key aeronautical services 1 can be weak depending on the particular circumstances of an airport, including its geographical location. Although potentially less capital intensive than airports, the safety requirements associated with air navigation services imply that a single air navigation service provider (ANSP) serves a geographic region. There is limited, if any, scope for direct competition between infrastructure providers within a geographic area, other than through competitive tendering for the provision of services within the area. In areas where there is considered not to be enough competition to protect users, economic regulation, in some form, is often applied to major airports and to ANSPs with the aim of achieving more economically efficient outcomes.",

Under a price cap approach the overall level of prices is constrained over a period of time to an upper limit often linked to inflation minus a productivity factor, such as CPI e X. 2 Under a price cap there are incentives for cost efficiency because the regulated firm is able to keep the gains from cost reduction which may be passed on to users at the next price review. Two types of price caps can be distinguished; 'pure' price caps and 'hybrid' price caps (Gillen, 2011; Niemeier, 2009) . Under 'pure' price caps the overall level of price caps is primarily determined through the estimated productivity gains available to the regulated firm rather than through reference to the regulated firm's costs. 'Hybrid' price caps set the overall level of the price caps primarily based on the firm's costs, typically estimated forward looking, and efficient costs.",

The key feature of price-cap regulation in practice, is that a fair rate of return on the capital base is set ex ante, on the basis of the regulator's perception of efficiency savings and input prices over the control period (Grayburn et al., 2002) . The key advantage of the price cap form of regulation is that it provides incentives for cost reduction and efficient pricing. This approach compares with rate-of-return regulation where prices are regulated based on total costs including depreciation and a normal rate of return on capital and there is less incentives for cost reduction and efficient pricing for the regulated firm. It is commonly applied to airports in North America and some European countries. There are additional variants of these two broad types of regulation, including 'sliding scale regulation' which relates the level of charges negatively to passenger growth over a given period of time. The price cap form of regulation, and how this form of economic regulation manages uncertainty for aviation infrastructure, is this focus of this paper.",

Australian experience is particularly interesting. A dramatic fall in demand for aviation services occurred in Australia at time when price caps were applied to newly privatized airports, and preceding the introduction of a long term price path for air navigation services. In October 2001, Ansett Australia, a major Australian domestic airline carrier, ceased operation coinciding with a global reduction in demand associated with the September 11 terrorist attacks in the USA. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic followed in 2002. The island nature of Australia, its large size, and the distances between major cities mean that there is a heavy reliance on air services. These characteristics contrast with those in some other countries where there is greater substitutability between airports and between modes of transport, such as in many European countries, where as a result the case for economic regulation of airports is considerably weaker.",

The form of regulation, such as whether a price cap approach is applied or rate of return regulation is used, is one potential source of risk. A company with high fixed costs that is under price-cap regulation faces excessive risk from demand fluctuations as these movements significantly affect the company's income but leave its cost level relatively unchanged (Alexander et al., 1996) . The link between regulatory structure and risk in infrastructure industries has been the subject of studies including comparisons of UK price cap regulation and US rate-of-return regulation. The studies undertaken usually focus on the effect of the regulatory structure on the regulated firm's cost of capital. Alexander et al. (1996) considered the evidence from a large number of countries to disentangle the influence of regulation on risk as measured by a firm's cost of capital. Their investigation involved studying regulated utilities in the UK, the Pacific region, Europe and North and South America. They show that the choice of regulatory regime affects the level of shareholder risk for the regulated company. They found that investors bear the greatest non-diversifiable risk with price caps and the least nondiversifiable risk with rate-of-return regulation. They considered that their results were in line with earlier more limited studies. The problem of focusing on just one specific element of what is a complete financial package is identified. The determination of the rate base and the way in which investment is treated are among other factors that are important.",

(Alexander et al., 1996, p.7) Extending the earlier analysis, Alexander et al. (2000) consider the various methodological questions that arise in the transport sector when establishing the link between the degree of market risk and a regulatory regime. Transport specific issues to consider include the presence of intermodal competition, the existence of shorter contracts and the geographic coverage of the companies. The results of quantitative studies confirm that even for the transport sector the choice of regulatory regime greatly affects the degree of market risk a company will face.

(2004) on infrastructure regulation and investment for the long-term finds that generic ownership forms (e.g. state ownership, private ownership) do not seem to be related to a specific investment pattern, such as under or over investment. It is the exact specification of the regulatory system that matters. Regulation needs to be refined to combine the advantages of incentive-based regulation with the appropriate investment incentives, and to develop other instruments, such as sliding-scale regulation and other sharing-mechanisms. Gaggero (2007) carried out an empirical investigation on whether different types of regulatory regimes, such as price cap regimes and rate-of-return forms of regulation, have different impacts on the level of risk incurred by regulated firms. He uses 93 regulated companies operating in six English-speaking countries with similar traditions, Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, UK and USA, during the period 1995e2004. Gaggero takes into account the underlying elements of the regulatory regime in which each company operates, such as whether price caps are of the 'pure' kind or whether they exhibit intermediate characteristics such as earnings sharing plans. He estimates the impact of the method of regulation (as measured by an index) on equity betas, the firms' systematic (non-diversifiable) risk. Using a more homogeneous sample of countries and a later time period, the results obtained by Gaggero are different from Alexander et al. (1996) and do not support the hypothesis that price cap regulation imposes more risk based on estimates of betas.",

While regulatory changes will impact on risk, the effect will depend on a number of factors, such as the framework under which they are made and how they are made. Understanding regulatory risk is important for policy design as the design of a regulatory system has a significant impact on the degree of systematic risk borne by a company.",

Regulators will typically use a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to estimate the return required by investors commensurate with the risks that they face (Biggar, 2011) . Within this approach a 'beta' value reflects the systematic (non-diversifable) risk associated with a firm. There are a number of well-known difficulties associated with estimating this parameter. Estimates of beta are not stable over time so estimates based on the historic beta of the firm may not be a reliable indicator of a firm's future cost of capital. Further, estimates of beta can be difficult to obtain when regulated companies are not quoted on stock exchanges, or where they undertake a wide range of activities across a range of industries and sectors, and in different countries (Alexander et al., 2000) .",

(2003) undertook a study on behalf of UK regulators on aspects of the cost of capital for regulated utilities in the UK. Their analysis of regulatory risk highlights that the type of uncertainty faced by a firm is an important determinant of the effect of regulation on its beta. They distinguish two conceptually different forms of regulatory risk. One form of regulatory risk arises from factors that are external to the firm and the regulator, such as macro-economic shocks, but have an impact on the regulatory scheme employed, such as the level of a price cap. The second source they identify relates to risk arising from factors that are internal to the regulatory process. Where regulatory agencies have statutory independence, and operate within legal frameworks provided by governments, a further conceptual distinction can be made within the regulatory process. Risks related to features of the regulatory frameworks provided by governments can be distinguished from risks related to discretionary action by regulators under a given regulatory framework.",

This resulted in complicated compliance requirements and Ministerial directions under the legislation being reissued a number of times.",

However, the cost pass through provisions relating to \"necessary new investment\" were ambiguous and resulted in much greater regulatory intervention than had been anticipated at the outset of privatization. The lack of clarity as to the investment costs that were covered by the price caps increased risks for airports and airlines alike. The existence of this unusual price cap feature encouraged airports to seek price increases above the level of the cap for a wide variety of investments, both large and small. The effects on uncertainty and incentives that resulted from this provision is likely to have been an important factor which contributed to the Government's removal of price caps on airports (see s.3.2 and s.3.4). From Table 1 it can be seen that the effect of the sudden downturn in activity from August to October 2001 was markedly different between airports. Price caps had been applied to some very small airports which suffered the largest declines in passenger numbers. These smaller airports also had relatively little market power compared to the largest three airports, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. In taking actions to ameliorate the significant decline in passenger volumes at the largest three airports, the Government only considered the negative shocks on demand and neglected the positive benefits that airports can gain from unexpectedly positive economic conditions. Table 1 The Australian Governments concern that the price caps did not allow \"flexibility to adjust to a changing aviation environment\" in its response to the Productivity Commission's report raises the question of whether this was a deficiency in the design of the price caps. Should the price caps have incorporated provisions reducing the impact of unexpected large and sudden volume changes? In a competitive industry a response to a fall in demand would not be accommodated by price rises. Additionally, the airlines and other parts of the aviation industry experienced significant falls in demand. However, relative to competitive industries and other parts of the aviation industry, major airports have high sunk costs and significant indivisibilities, and therefore more limited capacity to adjust their cost structure in the short term. It seems likely that the provision of an arrangement in the price cap to allow a temporary adjustment for rare occasions where an airports solvency could be at stake would reduce risks. For example, it may be possible to design a mechanism where in specified circumstances an airport would be able to get some limited relief by not reducing prices in line with the price cap. This could be a temporary 'borrowing' against future revenues which are paid back through compensating price adjustments at a later time.",

The Australian price monitoring, which replaced the price caps, has limited effectiveness in providing a constraint on the use of airport market power (Arblaster, 2014) . The maintenance of infrastructure solvency and profitability was a factor recognized by airlines in their support of review triggers for the pricing of air navigation services provided by Airservices Australia. The risk mitigation strategy adopted in the Airservices price agreement appears to take a riskneutral position over the longer term. It allows Airservices to earn only its cost of capital as reflected by the two sided nature of the aggregate activity level trigger and the ACCC approach to reviewing Airservices' cost of capital. 7 The ACCC has also encouraged Airservices to develop, in conjunction with airlines, more efficiency indicators of performance, including for capital expenditure (ACCC, 2011). These characteristics are likely to have resulted in the regulatory framework becoming progressively more risk adverse, as well as becoming more complicated and associated with higher administrative costs.",

The airport price caps were developed prior to the sale process so that 'X' values would be known to airport bidders. The political process determined characteristics of the design of the caps, including the coverage of price caps both in terms of which airports had price caps and which services were under the caps. The lack of transparency of the asset base that the price caps applied to, and lack of clarity relating to whether some new services were covered by the price caps, were among features of the price caps that raised significant uncertainty. Airservices price agreements were established subsequent to the development of airport price caps and benefited from 'lessons learned' from the airport experience. Additionally, air navigation services are provided by a single entity, which is corporatized and not privatized simplifies the regulatory process. However, the success of the arrangement in reducing regulatory risk can also be attributed to the greater use of principles of good regulation, including transparency, predictability, adaptability of the framework, and consultation, which were used in the establishment of the Airservices' price agreements.",

The use of principles of 'good regulation', which include principles such as transparency, predictability, adaptability of regulatory frameworks to changed market circumstances, regulation that is proportional to the situation that it is applied to, consultation in regulatory processes and 7 In the 2011 Airservices price review the ACCC was concerned that the weighted average cost of capital took appropriate account of the reduced risk to Airservices from the price review triggers (ACCC, 2011). effective and clear regulatory guidance, are among measures which can be adopted to reduce regulatory risk.
