            "text": "White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is a major shrimp viral pathogen responsible for large economic losses to shrimp aquaculture all over the world. The RNAi mediated by siRNA contributes a new strategy to control this viral disease. However, the efficient approach to deliver the siRNA into shrimp remains to be addressed. In this investigation, an antiviral vp28-siRNA was encapsulated in \u03b2-1,3-D-glucan, and then the \u03b2-1,3-D-glucan-encapsulated vp28-siRNA particles (GeRPs) were delivered into Marsupenaeus japonicus shrimp. The results showed that the vp28-siRNA in GeRPs could be released in hemocytes of shrimp. It was found that the GeRPs containing the vp28-siRNA inhibited the replication of WSSV in vivo, which presented a better antiviral activity than the non-encapsulated vp28-siRNA. Further evidence indicated that the mortality of WSSV-infected shrimp was significantly delayed by the GeRPs containing vp28-siRNA. Therefore, our study presented that the glucan-encapsulated siRNA might represent a novel potential therapeutic or preventive approach to control the shrimp disease.",

            "text": "White spot syndrome, caused by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), has become the most hazardous and devastating disease in shrimp culture. The virus can lead to 100% shrimp mortality within 7\u223c10 days in commercial shrimp farms, resulting in large economic losses (Escobedo-Bonilla et al. 2008) . WSSV, a rod-shaped enveloped DNA virus, contains a double-stranded DNA genome with 184 potential open reading frames (Yang et al. 2001) . Recently, the virus is classified as a new genus Whispovirus of a new family Nimaviridae (Mayo 2002) . Due to the importance of viral envelop proteins in virus infection, many WSSV structural proteins have been characterized (Tsai et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2005) . Among the WSSV structural proteins, the VP28 protein, located in the viral envelope (Zhang et al. 2002) , plays very important roles in the invasion of WSSV into shrimp (Witteveldt et al. 2004a, b; Wu et al. 2005; Xu et al. 2007 ). It has been reported that the VP28 protein, when being injected intramuscularly or administered orally, provides higher and prolonged survival rates after WSSV challenge (Witteveldt et al. 2004a, b) . Interestingly, the silencing of vp28 gene by a specific 21-bp short interfering in vivo leads to the eradication of WSSV in the virus-infected shrimp (Xu et al. 2007 ), which sheds a light on the control of WSSV infection in shrimp industry by administration of RNAi.",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) initiates posttranscriptional silencing of homologous genes (Fire et al. 1998; Elbashir et al. 2001; Hammond et al. 2001; Hannon 2002) . Higher eukaryotes can mount antiviral immune responses induced by dsRNA. RNAi is sequence-specific and can therefore be used to target gene expression (Cullen 2002) . In invertebrates, RNAi studies are commonly performed with large dsRNA molecules, which are cleaved into smaller 21-25-bp siRNAs by the host enzymes (Hammond et al. 2000) . However, it is reported that the 21-bp siRNAs are the most effective at triggering RNAi in vitro (Kim et al. 2004) . In fact, RNAi can be used as an antiviral immune defense strategy in Caenorhabditis elegans during VSV infection (Wilkins et al. 2005) . RNAi has been widely applied to suppress the infection or replication of many viruses, including several important human pathogens such as poliovirus (Gitlin et al. 2002) , HIV-1 (Jacque et al. 2002 ), hepatitis B virus (McCaffrey et al. 2003 ), hepatitis C virus (Kapadia et al. 2003) , foot and mouth disease virus (Kahana et al. 2004) , influenza virus (Tompkins et al. 2004) , and SARS coronavirus (Li et al. 2005) . In shrimp, it is reported that the injection of sequence-dependent siRNA, targeting the vp28 gene of WSSV, can eliminate the WSSV in virus-infected cells (Xu et al. 2007) . RNAi technology has been recently extended to shrimp as a therapeutic approach and efficient strategy for viral disease prevention in the aquaculture industry (Shekhar and Lu 2009; Westenberg et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2007; Xu et al. 2007 ). However, the efficient approach for delivery of siRNA into shrimp remains to be addressed.",

Based on our previous study (Xu et al. 2007) , in this investigation, the antiviral vp28-siRNA was encapsulated with \u03b2-1,3-D-glucan and delivered into shrimp. The results showed that the \u03b2-1,3-D-glucanencapsulated vp28-siRNA particles (GeRPs) effectively inhibited the replication of WSSV in shrimp.

Therefore, this siRNA was used as a target siRNA to control WSSV in this study. As controls, the sequence of vp28-siRNA was rearranged at random and mutated at one nucleotide, respectively, resulting in the corresponding random-siRNA (5\u2032-CAGACCTCACGACACAACA-3\u2032) and mutation-siRNA (5\u2032-GACCAGCGAAACCCACACA-3\u2032). The siRNAs used in this study consisted of 21-nucleotide double-stranded RNAs, each strand of which contained a 19-nucleotide target sequence and a two-uracil (U) overhang at the 3\u2032 end. The siRNAs were synthesized in vitro using in vitro Transcription T7 Kit (TaKaRa, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The synthesized siRNAs were dissolved in siRNA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl) and quantified by spectrophotometry.",

Forty picomoles of siRNA was incubated with \u03b2-1,3-D-glucan shells at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. Subsequently, the GeRPs were trapped with polyethylenimine (50 mg; Sigma, USA) for 20 min at 20-25\u00b0C. The siRNA-loaded GeRPs were then washed, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and sonicated to ensure homogeneity of the GeRPs preparation. For each experiment, GeRPs batches were aliquoted into tubes for daily dosing, flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C for later use. The final dosage of GeRPs contains 20 \u03bcg/g siRNA directed against the WSSV vp28 gene. For confocal microscopy, the empty \u03b2-1,3-D-glucan shells were labeled with 5-(4,6dichlorotriazinyl) aminofluorescein (Invitrogen, USA), and the siRNA was labeled with rhodamine B (Sigma, USA).

At the same time, the siRNA only and the GeRP only, as well as a negative control (0.9% NaCl) and a positive control (WSSV only), were included in the injections. In antiviral assays, 20 shrimp were used for each treatment. Everyday, the shrimp mortality was monitored and three shrimp specimens from each treatment, selected at random, were subjected to quantitative PCR analysis. All assays described above were carried out in triplicate.",

The data showed that the GeRPs had no toxicity to shrimp. When the shrimp were co-injected with GeRPs and WSSV, the shrimp mortality was significantly delayed (P<0.01), indicating that the infection of WSSV could be inhibited by the vp28-siRNA in GeRPs. By comparing the shrimp mortalities between the The cumulative mortality of WSSV-infected shrimp treated with siRNAs. The solutions used for injection were shown on the right. Each point showed the means of triplicate assays within \u00b11% standard deviation vp28-siRNA (non-encapsulated) and GeRPs (containing the vp28-siRNA) treatments (Fig. 4) , it was found that the GeRPs demonstrated better antiviral activity than that of vp28-siRNA, which was consistent with the detection of WSSV copies, showing a potential use of GeRPs in shrimp against virus infection by using glucan encapsulation. In our study, the GeRPs containing the vp28-siRNA could inhibit the replication of WSSV and further led to the decrease of virus-infected shrimp mortality. Therefore, our study presented a better strategy to control WSSV in the shrimp industry. It has been reported that the oral administration of \u03b2-1,3-glucan extracted from Schizophyllum commune can improve the shrimp immunity against WSSV (Chang et al. 2003) . However, \u03b2-1,3-glucan, derived from bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, exhibits no protection of shrimp against WSSV infection (Sukumaran et al. 2010 ). The documented data show that the improvement of shrimp immunity by \u03b2-1,3-glucan is changed with the resource of glucan. In our study, the \u03b2-1,3-glucan was derived from S. cerevisiae. Therefore, it could be concluded that the protection of shrimp against WSSV was due to the presence of vp28-siRNA. Our previous study showed that the sustainable presence of vp28-siRNA could lead to the elimination of WSSV in shrimp (Xu et al. 2007 ). To make the GeRPs containing vp28-siRNA more useful in shrimp industry, the sustainable presence of vp28-siRNA in vivo merited to be further studied.",
