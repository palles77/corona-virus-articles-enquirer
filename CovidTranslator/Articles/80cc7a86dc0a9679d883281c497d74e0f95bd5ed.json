            "text": "The intestinal microbiota is the collection of all live microorganisms that inhabit the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The word microflora is often used synonymously, but microbiota (from bios, Greek: life) is the technically correct term. The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in GI health and disease, yet our understanding of the composition, dynamics, and functionality of the intestinal ecosystem remains rudimentary. The total microbial load in the intestine is estimated to be 10 12 to 10 14 organisms, approximately 10 times the number of body cells. It is estimated that the intestine harbors several thousand bacterial strains. 1,2 This mutually interacting system comprising the host cells and the resident microbes is termed the intestinal microbiome. The microbiota can be influenced by exogenous factors such as diet and antibiotic administration, but it is usually resilient to these changes and returns rapidly to its pretreatment state. Therefore long-term treatment strategies for modulating the microbiota are necessary. New molecular tools have improved our understanding of microbial diversity in the intestine. Although the major phylogenetic lineages are similar, the microbiota differs substantially at the level of species and strain in each individual animal of the same species. Yet despite these differences, the metabolic end products in the intestine are very similar between individuals. New metagenomic approaches suggest the presence of a \"core microbiome,\" where the function of the intestinal ecosystem is independent of the presence of specific bacterial species or strains. For better understanding of microbial-host interactions in health and disease, future work must focus on the intestinal microbiome as one entity, evaluating its phylogenetic composition as well as metabolic functions.",

The selection of the best approach depends on the study problem (e.g., detection of specific pathogens in clinical specimens, or general characterization of the intestinal ecosystem), the cost, and the availability of technologies. Each method has strengths but also limitations (outlined below). For general ecologic surveys of microbial communities, molecular high-throughput sequencing techniques yield the most information as they allow in-depth identification of microorganisms. For screening of specific pathogens, culture techniques and species specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays may be most useful. Both of these methods are sensitive to sample handling and processing. Detailed instructions for sample collection and shipping for each particular assay should be acquired before sample submission as many laboratories use their own in-house culture or PCR assays. In the case of molecular methods, there is usually no standardization of DNA extraction or PCR protocols among laboratories, and such factors impact on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays. Improper DNA extraction, especially from fecal samples, may result in the presence of residual PCR inhibitors that cause false negative results. Because of the high sensitivity of PCR assays (theoretically a single target copy can be amplified), any DNA contamination can lead to false-positive results. A laboratory should be chosen that has expertise in molecular analysis, and that has validated each assay in the target specimen.",

Bacterial culture underestimates total bacterial numbers in the intestine, as microscopic counts (especially when using fluorescent dyes) are typically higher than the total viable counts obtained from culture. Although the majority of intestinal bacteria cannot be cultured, this does not necessarily mean that they are uncultivable, but rather, that insufficient information is currently available about their optimal growth requirements. Furthermore, many microbes depend on mutualistic interactions with other bacteria and the host, hindering their successful isolation in vitro. While recent advances have increased the cultivable fraction, 3 it is estimated that less than 10% of intestinal bacteria can be cultured, and an even smaller fraction can be correctly classified. Therefore studies of the intestinal ecosystem may universal-, group-, or species-specific primers) can be used for quantitative analysis.

            "text": "Molecular fingerprinting techniques are used for simultaneous analysis and comparison of microbial communities in multiple samples. These techniques provide information on microbial changes over time and in response to treatment. Available techniques include denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE), and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). The goal is to separate the mixture of PCR amplicons that were generated with broad range primers (universal or group specific) to yield a \"fingerprint\" of the bacterial community. This is achieved as each bacterial phylotype has a unique nucleotide composition (i.e., guanine+cytosine content). These differences in nucleotide composition result in unique melting behaviors of PCR amplicons. Each PCR amplicon reaches a specific melting point in a different position in a polyacrylamide gel, where it will denature and slow its migration. This banding pattern illustrates the bacterial diversity in the sample (Fig. 2-2) . In DGGE, a gel containing a linear gradient of DNA denaturants is used, whereas in TGGE a temperature gradient is used for separation. Bands of interest can be excised and sequenced. DGGE and TGGE are inexpensive and rapidly performed. However, because DGGE/TGGE bands are usually short, only limited resolution of PCR amplicons can be achieved, and many bacterial phylotypes will have similar or exhibit bias toward the minor cultivable portion of the gut microbiota. The analytical sensitivity of bacterial culture depends on the organism and its growth requirements. Bacterial culture is associated with difficulties in handling, storing, and shipping of clinical specimens. Ideally, samples should be processed immediately to preserve anaerobic species. Many selective culture media lack sufficient specificity, and often organisms other than the target are enumerated. 4 Phenotypic and biochemical identification systems often fail to accurately classify many microorganisms, requiring DNA sequencing of isolates.",

[5] [6] [7] The principle of these methods is that DNA or RNA is extracted from intestinal samples, and a specific gene is amplified with universal primers that target conserved regions (located up-and downstream of variable regions within the gene). 8 This approach allows in theory the amplification of DNA from all known and unknown bacterial species in a sample (see Fig. 2-1 ). The mixture of sequences can then be separated by subcloning and identified by sequencing, or they can be separated by methods that yield a \"fingerprint\" of the bacterial community. 8, 9 The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene is most commonly targeted as more than 1.6 million unique sequences are available in public databases (Ribosomal Database Project; http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/). Other more rarely used genomic targets include the 16S to 23S internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region or the chaperonin (cpn60) sequences. 10 If the sequence for a particular phylotype is known, specific PCR assays can be designed for its detection.

A commonly used method is the construction of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. 6, 7, 10 The PCR amplicons are separated by ligation into plasmid vectors with subsequent transformation into Escherichia coli cells. These cells are plated on culture medium and grown overnight. Each cell forms a colony containing one plasmid with the original amplified 16S rRNA gene sequence. This plasmid can then be purified and sequenced. Although this approach is informative, it is laborious and not well suited for analysis of large sample numbers. Recently, new high-throughput sequencing platforms have been introduced that allow automated separation of PCR amplicons without the need for subcloning. These platforms (e.g., 454-pyrosequencing, Illumina) allow several thousand sequences to be analyzed within a few hours, yielding a deep coverage of the microbiota. 2, 11 However, because of the high bacterial diversity in the intestine, groups of low abundance (especially pathogens of interest) may constitute such a low proportion of the total bacteria, that they still escape identification.

Animals can live well when raised under germ-free conditions. However, morphologic and immunologic differences between germ-free and conventionally raised animals suggest that that the commensal microbiota is a significant contributor to the development and maintenance of gut physiology and immune function. 39 Germ-free animals have an altered mucosal architecture (i.e., thinner lamina propria) and reduced turnover of epithelial cells compared with conventionally raised animals. 39 The underdeveloped immune system is rapidly restored upon introducing bacteria into germ-free mice. 40 Bacteria communicate with the host via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and dendritic cells. The resident intestinal microbiota is a crucial part of the intestinal barrier that protects the host from invading pathogens. This mechanism is called colonization resistance. Proposed defenses include the competition for oxygen, nutrients, and mucosal adhesion sites, and the creation of a physiologically restrictive environment for nonresident bacterial species (e.g., secretion of antimicrobials, alterations in pH, and hydrogen sulfide production). 41 Other crucial parts of the intestinal barrier are the intestinal epithelial cells, protective mucus, and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The increase in diversity of the colonizing microbiota at weaning strengthens the colonization resistance against pathogens. Furthermore, the resident microbiota drives maturation of the intestinal immune system. Younger animals with underdeveloped microbial diversity and immature GALT are dependent on protective colostral antibodies and milk components. Younger animals are typically more susceptible to invading pathogens (e.g., Campylobacter spp.). Studies of murine models have suggested that the pattern of microbial colonization in early life may impact on host physiology and colonizing resistance far into adulthood. 42 Bacteria in the large and small intestine can differ in their contribution to GI health. The large intestinal microbiota is mainly beneficial to the host. Clostridiaceae, Dorea spp., Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcus spp., Faecalibacterium spp., and Roseburia spp. are the predominant bacteria in the colon. The majority of colonic bacteria are anaerobic and their main functions are to produce energy from undigested food and to help in the competitive exclusion of potential pathogens. The slower flow of ingesta and the increased time and availability of nutrients favors microbial diversity in the colon. Bacteria within this ecosystem have developed cooperative strategies to transform the complexity of nutrients to their own and the host's benefit. Colonic bacteria provide digestive enzymes that allow utilization of complex carbohydrates. For example, 8% of the genome of Bifidobacterium longum is comprised of genes needed for carbohydrate metabolism. 43 Microbes metabolize sloughed epithelial cells, endogenous mucus, and nondigested substrates that have passed through the small intestine. The latter are predominantly complex carbohydrates, including starch and dietary fiber such as cellulose, pectin, and inulin. The fermentation of these substrates results mainly in the production of short-chain fatty acids (e.g., acetate, propionate, and butyrate) that provide energy for bacterial metabolism and for epithelial cell growth. Up to 7% of the metabolic energy of dogs, and to a lesser extent in cats, is produced by viruses, RNA viruses, single-stranded DNA [ssDNA] viruses). Consequently, a universal approach as used for bacteria and fungi is not feasible. New metagenomic approaches show the most promise for the characterization of intestinal viruses.",

Passing microbes (i.e., swallowed) are present only transiently in the GI tract. Within hours after birth, the sterile intestine becomes colonized by bacteria present in the birth canal, milk, and surrounding environment. 34 Shifts in relative proportions of bacteria occur during postnatal development. In one study, bacterial counts in the small intestine were highest in one-day-old puppies and decreased significantly thereafter. They remained stable at approximately 10 7 CFU/g over the observation period of 42 days. 34 Aerobes predominate in the first weeks of life, but the proportion of anaerobes gradually increases with age, mostly because of an increase in Bacteroidetes. The major shifts in microbial populations correlate with dietary changes (i.e., suckling and transition to solid food) and the physiologic development of the host's ability to metabolize dietary substrates (e.g., development of intestinal brush-border enzymes) in the first weeks after birth. 34, 35 The microbiota increases in diversity in the first few months of life and remains remarkably stable during adulthood. More pronounced changes are observed in older animals (i.e., dogs older than 11 years), especially in the large intestine. 20 These changes are most likely caused by the changing structure and function of the GI tract with increasing age. Older dogs have more Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus spp., and fewer Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus spp. 20 DGGE fingerprinting profiles also cluster according to age, and levels of Bacteroides are significantly lower in older dogs. 33",

            "text": "Several physiologic mechanisms regulate bacterial colonization in the intestine. Gastric acid, bile, and pancreatic enzymes inactivate most ingested microorganisms. Intestinal motility is an important regulator of bacterial counts in the intestine, as microbes that are not able to adhere to the epithelium will be quickly eliminated. In contrast, higher numbers of bacteria are present in the large intestine as a consequence of stagnant flow of luminal content and the abundance of nutrients. The ileocolic valve together with normal intestinal motility prevents retrograde migration of bacteria from the large into the small intestine. 36 Any changes in these control mechanisms may lead to alterations to community composition or total bacterial count. For example, atrophic gastritis or acid suppressant therapy leads to an increase in duodenal bacterial counts in man. 37 Similarly, dogs with experimentally induced exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) have increased bacterial number in highest bacterial counts and the diversion of the fecal stream or antibiotic therapy improves clinical signs. In murine models of IBD, inflammation develops only in the presence of bacteria. The causeeffect relationship between microbial alterations and inflammation is not well determined. It is suspected that intestinal inflammation causes a shift toward Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Proteobacteria) that may perpetuate the disease in genetically susceptible individuals. New hypotheses also suggest that intestinal inflammation may trigger alterations in the immune system, which, in turn, diminish the colonization resistance of the resident microbiota, resulting in an overgrowth of pathogens. 50 One current hypothesis implicates an abnormal interaction between commensal bacteria and the intestinal immune system in genetically predisposed individuals. 51 For example, a subset of people with Crohn's disease may not be able to effectively clear commensal or pathogenic bacteria, resulting in overcompensating antibacterial effector T cells that may, in turn, cause tissue damage. 51 People with Crohn's disease have a decrease in the bacterial phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and an increase in Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. 1 In most studies of human IBD, a reduction in the diversity of Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium coccoides subgroups) was identified, suggesting that these bacterial groups, which are mainly producers of short-chain fatty acids, may play an important role in maintenance of GI health. Alterations in microbial composition have also been recently reported in dogs and cats with IBD. 13, 49 Similar to people, dogs and cats with idiopathic IBD had significantly more Proteobacteria and reductions in Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV in their duodenum compared with healthy animals. 13, 49, 52 Boxer dogs with histiocytic ulcerative colitis respond to therapy with fluoroquinolones, and in this disease there is an association between the presence of adherent and invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) and inflammation. 53 These AIEC isolates share similarities to those obtained from ileal tissues of people with Crohn's disease. 53",

This observation emphasizes the need to distinguish the presence of beneficial clostridial groups from opportunistic commensals such as C. perfringens and Clostridium difficile. Changes in proposed beneficial bacterial groups such as Bifidobacterium spp. have also been observed in GI disease, although to a lesser extent. Modulating the intestinal microbial ecosystem is therefore a rational therapeutic approach in animals with GI disease. Clinical experience shows that dietary changes or antibiotic administration often leads to an improvement in GI signs. However, the exact mechanism remains elusive. Antibiotics can eliminate specific pathogens or can, as is also proposed for diets, lead to more general modulations of the intestinal microbiota.

Colonization with transient pathogens, overgrowth of resident opportunistic commensals, or altered communication between the intestinal innate immune system and the commensal microbiota may result in GI disease. Invasion of specific pathogens (i.e., Salmonella, enterotoxigenic C. perfringens, Campylobacter jejuni, and others) may profoundly disturb the structure of the GI mucosa. Enteric pathogens can penetrate into the submucosa and Peyer's patches, or produce exo-or enterotoxins that alter enterocyte function. Enterotoxins often stimulate mucosal fluid secretion, while villus effacement and loss of surface area diminishes mucosal absorptive capacity, resulting in diarrhea. Dysfunction of the mucosal barrier can lead to increased intestinal permeability and clinically significant bacterial translocation. 47 Several GI diseases are associated with nonspecific alterations in the microbiota. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or antibioticresponsive diarrhea (also known as tylosin-responsive diarrhea) is suspected to be caused by an intestinal dysbiosis. 48 Rapid diet changes or dietary indiscretion, changes in the architecture of the intestine, or changes in intestinal motility (e.g., surgical creation of intestinal loops, short bowel syndrome, and resection of the ileocolic valve) are also associated with alterations in the intestinal ecosystem. EPI is associated with an increase in bacterial counts in the canine small intestine, which often is reversible upon pancreatic enzyme supplementation. 38 Such alterations may lead to various mechanisms that will negatively impact the function of the GI tract. Examples are an altered intestinal barrier with increased intestinal permeability, and direct damage to the intestinal brush-border and enterocytes leading to nutrient and vitamin malabsorption. Overgrowth of specific bacterial groups may lead to increased competition for nutrients and vitamins and increased deconjugation of bile acids and creation of potentially deleterious metabolites.",

            "text": "The commensal intestinal microbiota is also thought to play an integral part in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in man, dogs, and cats. 1, 13, 49 In man, the microbiota is implicated because inflammation is present in gut compartments with the changes are largely individualized for each animal. Bacterial groups of a higher phylogenetic level (i.e., order or family) may show a synchronized response to the environmental influence, but these changes are rarely associated with one specific bacterial species or bacterial strain that is consistently altered in every individual. As a consequence of the complexity of the microbiota, the vast majority of bacterial groups within the ecosystem remain typically unaffected by diet or nutraceuticals. 33, 54 This complicates the prediction as to which animal may benefit most from a selected strategy. Probiotics can lead to a transient increase in the administered target species, but this has an insignificant impact on the composition of the total microbial ecosystem. Furthermore, probiotics are typically eliminated from the intestine within a few days after ending administration. Therefore administration of high doses over prolonged periods of time is usually required. Prebiotics are typically complex carbohydrates that are added to diets to enhance the growth of endogenous microorganisms; including Bifidobacterium spp. Increases in bacterial groups that utilize these nutrients have been demonstrated. 55 Such changes are again typically very minor within the entire ecosystem, as the administered prebiotics fulfill only some of the nutrient requirements for their target bacteria, but other essential nutrients remain at growth-limiting amounts. At this point, the significance of altering a rather minor proportion of the ecosystem remains unclear. It is also now well recognized that the microbiota is generally resilient to change and returns rapidly to its pretreatment state within a few days. Consequently, long-term modulation is needed to maintain a desired ecosystem. Antibiotic usage has a more pronounced effect and may disrupt the microbial ecosystem for prolonged periods of time (weeks to months). In one study evaluating the fecal microbiota of healthy people, approximately 30% of all bacterial taxa were affected, some of them for up to six months. 11 Similarly, administration of tylosin for 14 days led to significant modifications in the jejunal microbiota of dogs, with some bacterial groups depressed for more than 14 days. 2 However, highly individualized responses for some bacterial groups were observed in each animal.",

Every animal may require individualized management consisting of combinations of dietary modification, antibiotics, and pro-or prebiotics. Therefore, therapeutic modulation is currently based on empirical approaches with improvement of clinical signs as the most useful outcome measure. New molecular tools such as metagenomics and transcriptomics will be useful for elucidating how such modulatory strategies affect the gene content within the intestinal microbiome. This may help to customize treatment strategies for individual animals and conditions.",
