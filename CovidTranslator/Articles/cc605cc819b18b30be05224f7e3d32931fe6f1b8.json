On the other hand, practitioners can make a significant public health contribution with small changes to their everyday practices. For instance, the addition of routine rapid streptococcal antigen testing on patients with presumptive pharyngitis reduced antibiotic prescriptions by nearly 50% in a pediatric emergency department. 2 Patient education and early identification of highly transmissible diseases, such as the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, help to control the spread of disease and overall public health burden. Even seemingly basic symptomatic relief can speed the return to work and school and improve overall productivity.",

Influenza has a tendency to mutate, so vaccines must be revised yearly. It is spread easily via aerosolized droplets and direct contact, and is highly virulent due to frequent mutations.

Vaccination not only protects the individual but also conveys herd immunity to those not immunized. 11 Its effectiveness, however, is contingent on how well the yearly vaccine represents the actual viral strain in the community.

This group includes the elderly older than 65 years, pregnant women, children younger than 2 years, and patients with certain comorbid medication conditions such as asthma, heart disease, and immunodeficiency. Patients with severe or progressive cases of influenza requiring hospitalization should also be started on antiviral therapy as soon as possible, preferably within 48 hours. Antivirals may be considered for all other patients. Treatment is commenced empirically, without laboratory confirmation of influenza. 12 Prophylaxis with neuraminidase inhibitors is recommended for the following patients who have had close contact of a person with suspected or confirmed influenza during the infectious period: persons at high risk for complications of influenza, health care workers and emergency medical personnel, and pregnant women. High-risk vaccinated patients who received vaccine in poor-match years and immunosuppressed patients who have been vaccinated are also good candidates for antiviral prophylaxis. 12",

The rapid streptococcal antigen test is the quickest of the 3 and is highly specific (95%-98%), but is notably less sensitive than throat culture (75%-85%). One of the primary arguments in favor of rapid streptococcal testing is that it is relatively quick and minimally invasive. The rapid streptococcal test works by detecting the presence of a carbohydrate antigen unique to GAS; it consists of a throat swab and delivers a result in 10 to 20 minutes. This test allows the practitioner to determine the need for antibiotics while the patient is present, and studies have shown a decrease in overall antibiotic prescriptions in centers where the test was used routinely. 2 Throat culture is highly sensitive and specific for diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. Throat culture is sometimes recommended for confirmation after rapid streptococcal antigen testing is negative. Culture confirmation of negative rapid streptococcal testing, however, is the least cost-efficient method for managing possible pharyngitis. 16 Furthermore, culture confirmation of negative rapid streptococcal tests does not prevent more streptococcal complications than use of a single diagnostic test. 17 Exceptions to this include conditions in which there is a low probability of streptococcal throat infection (eg, summer months), when an antigen test with a poor sensitivity is used, and during an epidemic of acute rheumatic fever. 16 Intramuscular penicillin G or oral penicillin V (penicillin V potassium, penicillin VK), the phenoxymethyl analogue of penicillin G, have long been the standard of care for streptococcal pharyngitis. It is interesting that over 5 decades there has not been a reported resistance to penicillin in the treatment of pharyngitis. 18 Penicillin V, 500 mg 3 times a day for 10 days, is recommend and the potassium salt, penicillin VK, is more resistant to degradation by gastric acids than penicillin G. Other antibiotics such as amoxicillin, various cephalosporins, azithromycin, and clindamycin have been tried and advocated on the basis of taste or convenience, but currently penicillin V and penicillin G are still the recommended drugs of choice of the major medical academies. 19, 20 Erythromycin is the first-line alternative for those with penicillin allergies. Of note, benzathine penicillin G is the only antibiotic proven in controlled studies to prevent rheumatic fever, and is available as a one-time injection of 1.2 million units given intramuscularly. 20 Procaine penicillin alone is not an appropriate treatment.",

A culture typically is not obtained before commencing therapy, as it is not timely enough to dictate therapy and has no proven effect on outcome. 24 Antibiotic therapy should be aimed at covering both common aerobic and anaerobic organisms, as these abscesses tend to be polymicrobial. The most common anaerobic organisms found are Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, and Peptostreptococcus species, whereas aerobic organisms are primarily GAS (Streptococcus pyogenes), Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae. 25 Peritonsillar abscess is a clinical diagnosis that usually requires no imaging. Ultrasound has been used increasingly by emergency room physicians for locating the pus when performing incision and drainage, with good reliability. 26 Radiographs will show soft tissue thickening and possibly the presence of air within soft tissue; however, radiographs are not the imaging modality of choice if one is needed. Computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound can be useful adjuncts when the picture is unclear or when the abscess is located inferiorly. An inferior pole abscess occurs only in rare cases but should not be missed, as it can more readily lead to serious complications including parapharyngeal abscess, airway obstruction, aspiration of pus with resultant pneumonia or lung abscess, internal jugular vein thrombophlebitis, carotid artery rupture, mediastinitis, and pericarditis. 27 Recurrent peritonsillar abscess (>1/lifetime) is an indication for referral to an otolaryngologist for tonsillectomy. An interval tonsillectomy after the acute infection has subsided is often preferred over immediate (quinsy) tonsillectomy, except in the case of an inferior pole abscess when immediate tonsillectomy is the treatment of choice. Previous experience with quinsy tonsillectomy cautioned that higher rates of bleeding and other complications occur after immediate tonsillectomy, but recent reports have attempted to reverse this previous thinking. 28, 29 Parapharyngeal Abscess and Retropharyngeal Abscess Retropharyngeal abscess and parapharyngeal abscess are 2 of the most common deep space neck infections, with similar presentations, workup, treatment, and concerns. A parapharyngeal abscess (PPA) usually arises from direct extension from pharyngeal and odontogenic infections. A retropharyngeal abscess (RPA) originates most commonly from retropharyngeal lymphadenitis. RPA may also occur after penetrating trauma to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Because the parapharyngeal space communicates with all of the other deep spaces of the neck, spread can also occur from one space to another.",

Radiography is a good initial study that can quickly help to triage a patient in the proper direction of care. A lateral neck radiograph in the setting of retropharyngeal abscess may show soft tissue thickening or free air in the posterior pharyngeal soft tissues (Fig. 3) . A good rule of thumb is that if the width of the overlying soft tissues is greater than one-half the width of the corresponding vertebrae, there is significant swelling that should be evaluated further. This method is gross but easily applied. Any radiograph, however, is greatly limited if the patient's neck is not fully extended and the film is not taken during end-inspiration. These suboptimal positions may yield a false-positive result. Lateral neck films were found to have a sensitivity of 83% for determining the presence of a pediatric deep neck infection, whereas CT scanning with contrast had a sensitivity of 100%. 30 CT of the neck with contrast remains the study of choice for evaluation of suspected deep space neck infection (see Fig. 3; Fig. 4 ). From a respiratory and hemodynamic standpoint the patient must be stable enough to travel to radiology. Excessive secretions may preclude lying supine for the entire scan. CT findings include a rimenhanced area of low density, loss of fat stranding, edema of the surrounding tissues, and possible deviation of nearby structures such as the airway. With RPA there is some controversy as to what specific radiographic findings are consistent with pus at the time of incision and drainage. [31] [32] [33] Some investigators advocate that irregularity of the abscess wall was a stronger predictor than just rim enhancement for the presence of pus at the time of incision and drainage. 33 Although the information from a magnetic resonance (MR) image may be superior to that of CT for evaluation of deep space neck infections, the longer duration lying supine and the remote location are undesirable. MR imaging is also often not tolerated by young children without sedation. The ultrasound does not provide the spatial relationships necessary to assist in localizing the collection intraoperatively.",

Since the 1990s reflux has been considered a contributor to laryngeal irritation, and more recently studies have sought to understand its role in chronic nonspecific pharyngitis. 41 The mucosa of the larynx and pharynx are more sensitive to acid and pepsin than the gastric or esophageal mucosa. The larynx and pharynx lack bicarbonate production and peristalsis, which are protective to the stomach and esophagus. Koufman 42 demonstrated that even trace amounts of reflux, 3 times a week, are enough to cause mucosa trauma to the larynx. Recent studies in cell culture have shown that pepsin can damage hypopharyngeal cells in the absence of acid. 43 LPR is thought to be a distinct entity from GER. GER is a high-volume problem whereas LPR is a low-volume, high-susceptibility problem. Those with LPR are typically daytime upright refluxers whereas patients with GER are symptomatically worse when supine. Symptoms of LPR can be present in the absence of common gastroesophageal reflux symptoms such as sour brash and heartburn. Only about 25% of patients with LPR develop esophagitis.

Their symptom and finding scores also decreased compared with controls after 2 months of twice-daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. 41 There are 3 approaches to confirming the diagnosis of LPR: (1) response of symptoms to behavioral and empiric medical treatment, (2) endoscopic observation of mucosal injury, and (3) demonstration of reflux events by impedance and pHmonitoring studies or barium swallow esophagram. The first approach can be trialed by any primary practitioner. The latter 2 require referral to either an otolaryngologist or gastroenterologist for evaluation. On laryngoscopic examination, patients may manifest edema of the posterior glottis including the arytenoids and interarytenoid area. Erythema may also be present along the posterior glottis and posterior pharyngeal wall. There may be hypervascularity or edema of the true vocal folds (Fig. 6) .",

Alternatively, some advocate that starting on twicedaily therapy and then stepping down is more effective and less costly in the long run. 44 Patients should be counseled that it is important to take the PPI 30 minutes before meals for optimal effect. Two to 3 months of therapy usually are required to see effects.
