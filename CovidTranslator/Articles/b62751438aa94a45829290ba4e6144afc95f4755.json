Recently, the apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium was found to be one of the leading causes of infectious diarrhea in children 2,3and Infection with this parasite is strongly associated with mortality, growth stunting, and developmental deficits4. The major human pathogens causing cryptosporidiosis, C. hominis and C. parvum, infect the epithelial cells of the intestine and, through a mechanism that is not fully understood, trigger severe watery diarrheal symptoms. These are particularly longlasting and often life-threatening in malnourished and immunocompromised children4. Nitazoxanide, the only approved drug for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis has limited efficacy in those most vulnerable patient populations5,6. Cryptosporidiosis is also a wellrecognized opportunistic infection in adult AIDS and transplant patients4. Infection occurs through ingestion of the spore-like oocyst stage which shows remarkable resistance to water chlorination. Therefore, even in countries that apply advanced water treatment infection is common, Cryptosporidium is the cause of 50% or disease outbreaks linked to recreational water use in the United States. The search for cryptosporidiosis therapeutics has been hindered by the many technical challenges faced when working with this notoriously intractable parasite7. Here we establish a cryptosporidiosis drug discovery screening process combining phenotypic in vitro assays with novel animal models that take advantage of transgenic parasites8.",

Notably, many anti-malarials (spiroindolones9, cyclomarins10 and imidazolopiperazines11) lacked activity against Cryptosporidium, however 154 compounds showed >60% growth inhibition at 5 \u03bcM. Secondary screening using a novel cytopathic effect (CPE) based C. parvum assay confirmed several scaffolds, with imidazopyrazines12,13 and pyrazolopyridines14 showing sub-micromolar cellular activity (Fig. 1a -d and Table 1 , structures provided in Extended Data Fig.1 ). We evaluated \u02dc200 pyrazolopyridine analogs and found correlation between activity against C. parvum and Plasmodium falciparum (R 2 =0.702, Fig. 1d ) suggesting that the mechanism of action of pyrazolopyridines is conserved between these two parasites. No such correlation was observed with toxicity against HepG2 (R 2 =0.071) (Extended Data Fig.  2 ). C. hominis is responsible for the majority of clinical infections15. We thus evaluated a subset of pyrazolopyridine analogs against C. hominis, and found potency comparable to C. parvum (R 2 =0.872, Fig. 1e and Table 1 ).",

A very safe drug profile is thus a key component of the target product profile18,19. KDU731 has a selectivity index of more than 100 (CC 50 HepG2 = 15.6 \u03bcM and CpCPE EC 50 = 0.1 \u03bcM) (Extended Data Table 1 ). In a battery of safety pharmacology assays, the compound does not show intrinsic risks for cardiotoxicity, mutagenicity, clastogenicity, or phototoxicity and it does not significantly bind to a panel of human antitargets (Extended Data Table 1 and 2). KDU731 safety was further evaluated in a 2-week toxicology study in rats using a solid dispersion formulation to maximize systemic exposure (\u02dc25 fold). In this study, no significant histopathological changes and only minor changes in clinical chemistry and hematology were observed (slight elevation of chloride and phosphate ions and increase in red blood cells, see supplementary materials). Importantly, no hematopoietic toxicity related to potential inhibition of PI3K or PI4K lipid kinases was observed, suggesting that the in vitro selectivity of KDU731 translated to lack of host toxicity in vivo (Extended Data Table 1 ). Children with cryptosporidiosis in resource limited settings frequently suffer co-morbidities including HIV, TB, and other infections, anticryptosporidial drugs will thus likely be used along with other medications and the risk of drug-drug interactions needs to be minimized. Consistent with the requirement, KDU731 did not inhibit any of the major Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and did not induce human pregnane X receptor (Extended Data Table 1 ). KDU731 pharmacokinetics, metabolism and distribution was examined in mice, rats and rhesus monkeys. Upon intravenous administration, KDU731 displayed a low to moderate volume of distribution (Vss = 1.12 and 2.15 liter/kg), a low total systemic clearance (CL= 6.8 and 16 ml/min /kg) and a half-life ranging from 1-4 hours (Extended Data Table 3 ). KDU731 orally-administered in suspension formulation displayed a moderate half-life (T 1/2 = 2-4 h) in all three species. KDU731 was selected as a drug candidate because it shows moderate-to-low oral bioavailability (37% in rodents, 9% in non-human primates). As Cryptosporidium primarily infects the intestinal epithelium, we reasoned that systemic exposure may not be required for efficacy and that limiting systemic exposure may further enhance the safety margin of a cryptosporidiosis drug.",

Next, we inoculated 6-8 week old C57BL/6 IFN-\u03b3-knockout mice with 10,000 oocysts and monitored infection following parasite-derived luciferase activity in the feces (Fig. 2a) . Infected mice were treated orally with KDU731 in suspension formulation and parasite load was measured in the pooled feces by Nluc and quantitative PCR assay with a high degree of correlation (Spearman coefficient=0.786; two-tailed P=0.048). The Nluc assay has a small sample requirement (20 mg) and thus could be conducted on individual mice as well as pooled feces (unpaired t-test comparing means of individual and pooled readings showed no significant difference, two-tailed P=0.3862). Importantly, KDU731 dramatically reduced oocyst shedding regardless of assay method ( Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 4b and c, non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, pooled Nluc two-tailed P <0.001; fecal qPCR two-tailed P=0.0042). In a modified design, KDU731 (10 mg/kg) treatment was initiated at the peak of infection again resulting in significant reduction of oocyst shedding ( Fig. 2a and c) . At the end of the treatment period three mice per group were killed and intestines were processed for histology. We did not observe parasites in the intestines of treated animals while those that received vehicle showed substantial infection (Fig. 2d ).",

A 404 bp fragment of the 5'TK flank, the tk gene and a ribosomal 3'UTR was inserted upstream of the 5' actin UTR using Gibson Assembly cloning (New England Biolabs). The final vector, along with the Cas9 plasmid containing a TK guide RNA (GAAGAATACAATTTCTAAGG) that targets the 3' end of the tk gene was used to transfect C. parvum sporozoites. Sporozoites were delivered via surgery into the small intestine of C57BL/6 IFN-\u03b3 knockout mice (B6.129S7-Ifngtm1Ts/J, Jackson Laboratories) using procedures described previously8.

Assuming a type I error risk of 5% and a type II error risk of 80%, 7 calves were needed in the treatment group, plus 2 positive controls. In the event of calf death or removal from the study, an additional 4 calves were added to the control group (n = 6). Sample size was calculated using Epi Info. Fifteen Friesian-Holstein bull calves were enrolled in November 2015 and February 2016. At birth, all calves enrolled in November were randomized to treatment with KDU731 (n = 7), positive infection control (n = 2), and negative infection control (n = 1). The 5 calves enrolled in February were positive controls. The perineum of the dam was cleaned with povidone-iodine scrub and calves were delivered onto single-use plastic sheets to prevent exposure to environmental pathogens. Calves with abnormal physical examination findings and those weighing less than 29.5 kg at birth were excluded. Enrolled calves received 4L \u2265 50g IgG/L commercial colostrum replacer (Land O'Lakes Inc.) and a 3 ml subcutaneous injection of vitamin E and selenium (Merck Animal Health). Calves were then transported from the commercial dairy farm to Washington State University where they were housed in individual box stalls in a BSL-2 facility. Shatter-proof mirrors were provided for enrichment. Within 48 h of birth, blood samples were collected and evaluated for adequate passive transfer of colostral immunity. Calves were offered a commercial 20% protein/20% fat non-medicated milk replacer (Land O'Lakes Inc.) every 12 h via nipple bucket. At each feeding, calves were fed an average of 8.8 g of dry matter per kg of birth weight for the duration of the study. Water was provided ad libitum.

Whole animal imaging during the treatment period is shown inFig 2g.Fecal oocyst load was determined by measuring parasite DNA by qPCR in feces pooled from a cage of 5 mice. b, Mice (n=4) were infected with 50,000 UGA2 FLuc oocysts and imaged after one week. Mice were killed and the small intestine was resected and imaged (representative image shown). Infection of the intestine ranges in intensity from heavy in the ileum to more moderate in the jejunum and cecum (see radiance scale bar for comparison). Intestines were cut into 12 segments and luminescence of each segment was recorded. c, Quantitative PCR analysis of intestinal segments was performed in triplicate and plotted against the respective luminescence measurements. Regression analysis found robust correlation of tissue luminescence and PCR for parasite DNA with an R2 of 0.8.Extended DataFigure 7.
