Many people feared that SARS would spread through the health care system, and outpatient visits fell by more than 30% in the course of a few weeks. We examine how both public information and the behavior and opinions of peers contributed to this reaction. We identify a peer effect through a difference-in-difference comparison of longtime residents and recent arrivals, who are less socially connected. Although several forms of social interaction may contribute to this pattern, social learning is a plausible explanation for our finding. We find that people respond to both public information and to their peers. In a dynamic simulation based on the regressions, social interactions substantially magnify the response to SARS.",

Facing an increase in disease risk, people protect themselves and thereby limit the spread of infection. With few exceptions (de Paula et al., 2011; Gong, forthcoming) , this literature has assumed that decision makers possess complete information, which is an unrealistic assumption in a disease outbreak. In even the most saturated media environment, public announcements only weakly indicate a person's idiosyncratic infection risk. Without a precise public signal, people may rely on private signals such as the opinions and actions of their peers. This mechanism may cause an \"information cascade\" that magnifies the response to an unfamiliar threat (Banerjee, 1992; Bikchandani et al., 1992; Welch, 1992) .

Reports of local and national SARS incidence provide public risk signals. We proxy for the risk signal of peers using the change in health care utilization among peers from a pre-SARS baseline, which derives from a simple model of health care demand. A regression of individual medical visits on these variables distinguishes between the contributions of public information and peer signals. Our analysis uses a nationally representative panel of medical claims of 1 million people (4.3% of Taiwan's population). This source allows us to quantify the number of outpatient visits by patient, provider and two-week period from 2001 to 2003 for a 16% subsample of this data set. We proxy for peer groups, which the claims data do not directly measure, using cohorts of patients who visit a common physician and facility.",

Patients may sort into peer groups because of common risk or health preferences. Heterogeneous supply shocks, such as office closures by some doctors, may also induce a spurious correlation. Patients in the same peer group may receive correlated signals of SARS risk if they obtain news from the same media sources. We address these concerns through a difference-in-difference design that compares the response of longtime community residents (\"non-movers\") to the response of recent arrivals (\"movers\"). Although these groups face a similar (vanishingly small) risk of contracting SARS, non-movers have stronger social ties to their communities. We find that non-movers respond more to their peers than to local SARS incidence but less than to national SARS incidence. This identification strategy places a lower bound on the peer effect because it is based on a differential response.",

We evaluate this assumption through a complementary approach in which we address common unobservables by controlling for current peer visits. This strategy relies on variation in lagged peer visits for identification. Fixing current visits, a peer group whose visits were previously high conveys a stronger signal of SARS risk than a group whose visits were previously low. By specifically controlling for the visits of nonmover peers, we deal with the concern that shocks specific to nonmovers confound the difference-in-difference regressions. In a final falsification test, we apply our methodology to the annual drop in visits that occurs during Chinese New Year and find that peer effects do not explain this phenomenon.",

Information is scarce during a novel epidemic, as even experts lack basic facts about the disease. In the absence of more reliable signals, people may learn from the behaviors and perceptions of their peers. Several mechanisms other than social learning may contribute to our peer effect estimate. In principle, SARS contagion among peers may cause a positive correlation in peer visits during the SARS period. This mechanism is not a serious confound in practice because SARS prevalence is very low, even in the highest-risk townships. 1 Alternatively, people may imitate rather than learn from their peers. We cannot distinguish learning from imitation without richer data. Finally, the visits of peers may be negatively correlated through congestion at health care facilities, which also causes our estimates to be a lower bound.",

For instance, objectively small terrorism and health risks have large impacts on commerce (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003; Blunk et al., 2006; Kraipornsak, 2010) . Becker and Rubinstein (2011) find that Israeli tourists respond more strongly to terrorism risk than local residents, and suggest that people who regularly confront risk may invest in the ability to surmount an emotional response. Social interactions may also explain why people adopt mistaken beliefs and respond in extreme ways to a crisis. The magnitude of this private response determines the impact of a crisis. Just as air travel reductions after 9/11 caused more people to die in traffic accidents than in the attacks themselves (Blalock et al., 2009) , health care avoidance during SARS may have caused more deaths than the epidemic itself. 2 We proceed in Section 2 to motivate and justify our empirical approach. This section shows the assumptions under which our empirical strategy identifies a peer effect. Section 3 describes the health care setting in Taiwan, the SARS epidemic, and the data set. Regression results appear in Section 4. Section 5 describes a dynamic simulation of the aggregate response to SARS. Section 6 discusses the interpretation of our findings and Section 7 concludes.",

The primary identifying assumption of this regression is that common unobservables have the same effect on movers and non-movers during the SARS period: \u03bb 3 md = \u03bb 3 nd . Under this assumption, the differential effect of common unobservables during SARS cancels and the coefficient for N i D t \u0394v Ii jt isolates a peer effect. This regression controls for any shock that is common to movers and non-movers, including supply heterogeneity. Our approach provides a lower bound estimate of the peer effect because it excludes any social interactions by movers during SARS as well as social interactions by either group prior to SARS (\u03bb 2 mp , \u03bb 2 np and \u03bb 2 md ). We provide further evidence using a complementary identification strategy that does not distinguish between movers and non-movers. Instead we regress the change in individual visits on current and one-year lagged peer visits with a SARS period interaction. Common unobservables primarily threaten identification by causing a correlation between contemporaneous values of v ijt and v Ii jt . However Fig. 1 illustrates that lagged visits also contain information about a person's risk perception. Fixing current visits, a peer group with previously high utilization provides a larger risk signal than a peer group with previously low utilization. Contemporaneous shocks are unlikely to confound the differential effect of lagged peer visits during SARS, since these visits occur prior to the epidemic.",

In a sharp deviation from the usual seasonal pattern, visits fell by over 30% from March to June of 2003. Visits did not return to the pre-SARS level until September of that year, three months after the last probable SARS case on June 16. Based on the number of SARS deaths and outpatient visits from March to June of 2003, SARS created a mortality risk of at most 0.0000007 deaths per visit. Using an upper-bound estimate of $2.2 million for the value of statistical life (Hammitt and Liu, 2004) , the risk of SARS death during a medical visit raised the expected price of a visit by $1.93. However the decline in visits during SARS is consistent with a much larger perceived cost. After a copayment increase of $3 in November of 2002, visits to medical centers fell by 3%. Benchmarking the SARS response by this copayment response, people behaved as if SARS had increased the price of a visit by $17.60. 6 The response to SARS occurred both in townships with and without actual SARS incidence. Fig. 4 plots total visits, comparing townships with zero and positive SARS incidence. The response to SARS is only slightly larger in townships that actually experienced the outbreak. The timing and magnitude of the SARS response also depended on the nature of the visit. Fig. 5 categorizes visits as respiratory, critical, chronic, or other. 7 Although utilization fell in all categories, the response of respiratory visits was particularly sharp and extended. These visits fell by over 50% and remained suppressed through the end of the year. Although respiratory visits are distinct in several aspects, the low marginal benefit of a respiratory visit is the most likely explanation for this pattern. 8",

A reported case is any case that the TCDC investigates as a possible SARS infection. A probable case is a reported case that also (1) exhibits high fever and difficulty breathing, (2) an epidemiological link to other SARS cases, and (3) radiographic evidence of pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome or a positive assay for the SARS coronavirus (WHO, 2003) . 9 To express SARS incidence as an infection probability, we compute the number of cases per 100 people. 5 This assumption also requires type-specific time fixed effects. With this modification, the first term of \u03be ijt is the difference between s ijt p,md and s p;md i jt . Regression estimates that include type-specific time fixed effects (available from the authors) are equivalent to the estimates in Section 4. The insensitivity of our estimates to type-specific time fixed effects suggests the first element of \u03be is not a serious confound. 6 The mortality risk calculation assumes conservatively that all SARS deaths arise because of outpatient visits. Consistent with the extreme response, Liu et al. (2005) find that the VSL associated with avoiding SARS risk is several times greater than conventional VSL measurements from Taiwan. 7 Critical visits include visits related to pregnancy, abortion, injury, appendicitis, stroke, heart attack, and internal bleeding. Chronic visits include visits related to dialysis, chemotherapy, diabetes, and liver or kidney failure. 8 Patients with mild respiratory illnesses may have also feared that doctors would place them in quarantine (Hsieh et al., 2005) . As a respiratory condition, SARS could also have increased respiratory visits among people concerned about possible exposure. 9 Confirmatory diagnostic tests for SARS did not become available until midway through the epidemic. Even once these tests arrived, authorities did not provide immediate confirmation of SARS infection. Therefore, people did not generally have information about confirmed SARS incidence.",

We proxy for peer groups using cohorts of patients Using this measure, 93.1% of the population belongs to at least one peer group and the median number of peer groups is seven. Quartiles of the group size distribution occur at 12, 55, and 204 people. A peer group definition based on common health care utilization is sensible for two reasons. People typically seek outpatient care for mild conditions and are unwilling to travel far outside the community. Outpatient health care markets in Taiwan are highly localized and many neighbors visit the same physician. Because most patients select a physician through a friend's referral, patients of a common physician often share a direct or indirect acquaintance (Hoerger and Howard, 1995; Tu and Lauer, 2008) . 10 Noise in the definition of a peer group is a common issue that does not ordinarily interfere with the identification of social interactions as long as the true social network overlaps with the proxy (Blume et al., 2011) . Misspecification of peer groups most likely causes attenuation bias through the same mechanism as classical measurement error. In Section 4, we show that results are robust to defining peer groups by facility, township, or county. Results are also similar if a person must visit twice from 2001 to 2003 rather than just once in order to count as a group member. 11 The one-year change in average visits of peers proxies for the group's perception of SARS risk. v Iijkt denotes the average number of visits in group j and township k, excluding the index person. The change in peer visits, \u0394v Iijkt is the difference in v Iijkt from the same two-week period in the previous year: \u0394v Iijkt \u2261 v Iijkt \u2212v Iijkt\u221226 . The lagged component of \u0394v Iijkt always captures pre-SARS utilization because SARS lasted for less than a year. While the duration of the difference is arbitrary, a one-year difference implicitly removes seasonality from the regressor. Regressions in which \u0394v Iijkt is constructed as a six-month difference lead to similar results. For both \u0394v Iijkt and SARS incidence, we construct the sum over periods t \u2212 2 to t (a six week period), allowing these variables to reflect SARS risk information from the preceding six weeks.",

Next we determine each patient's modal township by year and define a move as a transition across townships with low overlap. 14 This process allows us to classify people by tenure status in the community, which ranges from 1 to \u22657 years.

We begin by discarding peer groups that contain only movers or only non-movers (2% of all observations). For the remaining peer groups, we attempt to draw 16 people who have tenure of 1, 2 or \u2265 7 years. We attempt to draw 8 people with tenure of 3, 4, 5, or 6 years. This step increases the proportion of movers and reduces the proportion of people with tenure of \u22657 years relative to the population. This procedure yields a regression data set with 28.3% movers and a sufficient share of people with 10 Published evidence of this phenomenon from countries other than the US is extremely limited. Anecdotally, referrals are especially important in Taiwan because there are few institutional restrictions (such as HMO networks) on the choice of physician. 11 If group membership requires two rather than one visit, then 85% of the population belongs to at least one group and the median number of groups per person is 4. Quartiles of the group size distribution occur at 6, 29, and 115 people. 12 The identification strategy exploits heterogenous exposure to social interactions among subsets of the peer group. Cohen-Cole (2006) and Blume et al. (2011, Theorem 2) derive the conditions under which this approach is valid. Despite the superficial similarity, this strategy is distinct from Gaviria and Raphael (2001) , who test the endogeneity of school choice by comparing movers and non-movers. 13 This dichotomy between movers and non-movers does not conflict with Munshi's (2003) finding that international migrants with larger destination networks have better outcomes. Munshi compares migrants from different origin communities within the same city, and does not claim that migrants have larger networks than longtime destination residents. 14 As a baseline, townships have low overlap if they fall below the fifth percentile of the overlap distribution, so that less than 0.17% of patients visit doctors in both townships. As we show below, results are robust to using the tenth percentile of overlap (0.92%) as an alternative cutoff. tenure of 3-6 years. Our regressions use probability weights to restore the population proportions and weight individual patients equally. Table 1 compares the characteristics of movers and non-movers. Because of the large sample, all mean differences in the table are statistically significant with p b 0.001. 15 In Panel A, non-movers average 0.039 visits per two-week period, compared to 0.032 for movers. Movers and non-movers are diagnosed with respiratory infections (e.g. sore throat and cold) at comparable frequencies. These groups have similar gender and income distributions, but movers are an average of 7.2 years younger than non-movers. Panel B summarizes the characteristics of peer groups. Movers' and non-movers' peer groups are generally similar, however movers differentially belong to large peer groups and groups with a high intensity of respiratory visits. Because regressions below include tenure \u00d7 SARS fixed effects, periodspecific level differences between movers and non-movers do not confound the estimates.",

Becker and Rubinstein (2011) suggest that people overreact to unfamiliar risks. In our setting, overreaction does not explain the sharp increase in the coefficient of variation in Fig. 7 , while social interactions can explain this pattern. Without a theory of differential overreaction by non-movers, overreaction also fails to explain the differential correlation between the behavior of 23 This exercise is based on the following algorithm. First, we create a simulation data set with 1000 hypothetical doctor's offices, each populated with 61 patients, the median size of peer groups in the regression sample. The simulation data set spans the period from 2002 to 2003. For each person, the number of visits during period t in 2002 equals the mean of this variable for movers in the regression sample. Beginning with the first period in 2003, we construct v ijkt using \u0394v Iijkt and v ijkt \u2212 26 based on lagged data according to the requirements of each counterfactual. 24 Simulation regressions deviate from our earlier regressions in two important ways.",

Our regression eliminates the need to assign simulated people to actual townships by omitting local SARS incidence, for which the effect is small. 25 Visits in our simulation closely track the actual decline in visits by movers, for whom all visits fell by around 25% and respiratory visits fell by around 60%. 26 This result differs slightly from the finding in Table 5 that peer effects had the largest impact in Quarters 2 and 4. This difference most likely arises because the simulation uses a single dummy for the SARS period (Quarters 2-4) , while regressions in the table use separate dummies for each quarter. non-movers and their peers. In our analysis, both public signals and time fixed effects may embody overreaction to SARS. The simulation, which shows similar responses to public information and social interactions, suggests that peer effects contribute in an important way to the response to SARS in Taiwan.",

As we discuss in Section 2, social learning is a very plausible cause of a heightened peer effect for nonmovers during SARS. In a novel epidemic, people face considerable uncertainty about the risk and severity of the disease, as well as the effectiveness of possible prevention measures. Public signals such as incidence reports only provide a noisy signal of an idiosyncratic risk exposure. People with social connections may demand additional information from peers under these conditions. Peer imitation may also contribute to the peer effect during SARS. Imitation lacks a consensus definition (Apesteguia et al., 2007) , however imitation is distinct from learning because learning involves the transmission of information among peers. A complementarity between individual and peer consumption (either through utility or the budget constraint) may lead to imitation. Complementary utility may lead people to watch the same television shows or wear the same clothing brands as their peers. Complementarity in terms of the budget sets may cause peers to share transportation to common activities. A medical visit is distinct from entertainment or clothing because health is idiosyncratic, and so a peer's health care utilization does not strongly influence someone's utility of a medical visit. Imitation due to cost sharing (e.g. carpooling to medical facilities) could contribute to the peer effect, however this effect would need to become stronger during SARS to contribute to identification, which we do not suspect. Finally, peers could have coordinated with each other in terms of the extent of social distancing. While we cannot rule out this hypothesis, it would be odd to coordinate in this dimension without also communicating SARS risk perceptions.",

By interacting socially, peers may transmit communicable diseases to one another, causing a positive correlation in their medical visits. SARS prevalence is too low for SARS contagion to have a noticeable effect on our estimates. SARS incidence peaked nationally in Period 10 of 2003, in which there were 270 probable cases. During this period, there were 928,700 outpatient visits, which was 230,300 fewer than Period 10 of 2002, so that SARS diagnoses comprise 0.029% of visits during this period. The maximum of SARS incidence occurs during Period 9 of 2003 in the Jhongjheng District of Taipei City, in which there were 96 probable cases (0.00006 SARS cases per capita), so that SARS diagnoses comprise 0.57% of visits in Jhongjheng during this period. SARS contagion contributes positively to health care utilization during this period, which works against the aggregate decline in visits that we observe. Our estimates are robust if we limit the sample to the 68% of township \u00d7 period observations with zero SARS incidence. Non-SARS contagion may also induce a correlation between the medical visits of peers. However this mechanism can only explain a peer effect for visits due to communicable diseases. Table 5 distinguishes between respiratory, chronic, critical and \"other\" visits. Critical visits include diagnoses of pregnancy, abortion, injury, appendicitis, stroke, heart attack, and internal bleeding, all of which are noncommunicable. Chronic visits relate to dialysis, chemotherapy, diabetes or liver failure. \"Other\" visits include diagnoses that are neither respiratory, chronic, nor critical. This category is also predominately non-communicable. Contagion cannot explain the significant social interactions for critical and other visits in Columns 3 and 5 of Table 5 .",

People assume that SARS is distributed binomially in the population. This implies that the posterior probability of an individual catching SARS is a linear weighted average of the means from different data sources (Jewell, 1974) and their priors. For tractability, we make two assumptions about these weights. First, each person places identical weight on the private information of different peers. Second, all individuals place the same weight on each information source. In addition, we define the composite influence of an individual's prior information and his priors as s ijt p . 28 This definition does not compromise generality because we proceed under the conservative assumption that s ijt p is not observed.

First, movers and non-movers 27 People may sample peers' beliefs by communicating directly or by observing behaviors like the change in health care utilization, which indicate beliefs.

In Eq.

Limiting the sample to only large networks, for which this assumption is most valid, does not affect our results. obtain private signals and peers' information in the same way, so the correlation between different sources of data is identical for movers and non-movers, i.e., \u03b3 3 m = \u03b3 3 nm . Second, movers and non-movers follow the same Bayesian updating process in Eq. (7). 30 These assumptions imply that the coefficient on average peer beliefs in Eq.

Using this coefficient estimate rather than\u03b2 1 leads to a larger estimate of learning from public information. It is also more accurate if the common signal is uncorrelated with private information or prior beliefs. A regression based on Eq.
