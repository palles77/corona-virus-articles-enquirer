South China agricultural university, found beta coronavirus in the pangolin, it is need to further research whether it belong to novel coronavirus or not. South China seafood wholesale market is the main source of infection in Wuhan city of Hubei province. The early cases of NCP were mainly imported infections directly or indirectly from Wuhan [13] . According to the analysis of the current infection situation, Hubei province, is a NCP infections most populous province, followed by Guangzhou province and Zhejiang province, which is related to the economic development and intensive personnel exchanges; Henan province and Anhui provinces also had higher cases of NCP, which is related to neighboring of Hubei province. On January 26, 2020, the suspected cases of the NCP showed a rapid increase. According to the information that the general incubation period of the disease is 3-7 days and the diagnosis needs 2 days, the rapid increase of the suspected cases may be related to the banquet held by the community of Baibuting community in Wuhan city on January 18, 2020.

On February ,2020, the suspected cases of NCP has reached 5328. since then, suspected cases and confirmed cases were gradual decline, It may be related to the traffic control in Wuhan, as well as the first-level response to major public health emergencies and relevant control measures launched by several provinces on January 23, 2020, But during the Spring Festival, a time of traditional Chinese reunions, more than 10 million people in the city of Wuhan, the source of the .

The basic reproduction number(R0) is an index that reflects the ability of the virus to transmit [17] .The basic reproduction number(R0) is defined as the number of second-generation cases that can be infected under ideal conditions when a case enters a susceptible population. On January 23, 2020, the WHO estimated that the basic reproduction number of the novel coronavirus was 1.4-2.5 [18] . The infectious power of the novel coronavirus was lower than that of SARS and MERS [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

To some extent, the turning point in controlling the spread of NCP appears, but the onset of the novel coronavirus has a confidentiality and the novel coronavirus can also be infected during incubation period, at the same time, many people return back to work after the Spring Festival and the cumulative cases of NCP is still more, All these factors lead to that the NCP will still exist for a period of time. Extinction index reflects the extinction rate of the disease. Because there is no specific drug against the NCP and the course is long and the cumulative number of infections is large, the turning point of the disappearance of the disease in China mainland has not yet occurred, but the turning point of the disappearance of the NCP in China mainland except Hubei province has occurred. It is expected that serum antibodies to cure patients, traditional Chinese medicine, newly developed vaccines and drugs in clinical trials such as Remdesivir will work against the NCP [5, 23] .",
