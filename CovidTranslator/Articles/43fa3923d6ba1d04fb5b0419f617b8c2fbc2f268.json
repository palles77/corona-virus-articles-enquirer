The IDSR is a strategy of the WHO Afro region adopted by the member states in 1998 as a regional strategy for strengthening weak national surveillance systems in the African region (2, 3) . The DSNOs under the supervision of the Medical Officers of Health (MOHs) are responsible for surveillance activities within their Local Government catchment area. Therefore, their role is very crucial to the success of the IDSR strategy.",

            "text": "In the last decade, the scope of public health (PH) surveillance has grown, and biosurveillance capacity has expanded in Duval County. In 2004, the Duval County Health Department (DCHD) implemented a standalone syndromic surveillance (SS) system, which required the manual classification and entry of emergency department (ED) chief complaints by hospital staff. At that time, this system, in conjunction with other external systems (e.g., CDC ILInet, FluStar and NRDM) were used to conduct surveillance for health events. Recommendations from a 2007 ISDS panel were used to strengthen surveillance within Duval County. Later that year, the Florida DOH moved to a statewide SS system and implemented ESSENCE, which has been expanded to include (1) ED record data from 176 hospitals (8 within Duval County); (2) reportable disease case records from Merlin; (3) Florida Poison Information Network consultations; and, (4) Florida Office of Vital Statistics death records (1) . ESSENCE has subsequently become a platform for rapid data analysis, mapping and visualization across several data sources (1) . As a result, ESSENCE has improved business processes within DCHD well beyond the initial scope of event detection. These improvements have included (1) expansion of the ability to create visualizations (e.g., epi-curves, charts and maps); (2) reduction in the time required to produce reports (e.g., newsletters and media responses); (3) reduction in staff training needs; and (4) augmentation of epidemiology processes (e.g., active case finding, emergency response and quality improvement [QI] ) and closing the PH surveillance loop.",

Conducting ad hoc ED surveillance was compared between ESSENCE and e-mail/telephone methods. QI reviews were compared between ESSENCE and Merlin Analysis Tools. The number of software or systems requiring training, which were replaced by ESSENCE, was reviewed. Computational steps included page clicks, exporting/importing data between systems and data management.

Data are collected for 19 of 20 King County EDs, for visits that occurred the previous day. Over time, various problems with data quality have been encountered, including data drop-offs, missing data elements, incorrect values of fields, duplication of data, data delays and unexpected changes in files received from hospitals. In spite of close monitoring of the data as part of our routine syndromic surveillance activities, there have occasionally been delays in identifying these problems. Since the validity of syndromic surveillance is dependent on data quality, we sought to develop a visualization to help monitor data quality over time, in order to improve the timeliness of addressing data quality problems.",

The heatmaps summarize data by month and year, though other visualizations (e.g., daily or weekly) are also possible. For each row on the heatmap, a color change indicates that data quality has shifted over time. Blocks with stable color over time suggests that there has not been a change in data quality. White space on the heatmap highlights periods of time where data were not recorded by the system and can provide a visual cue for newly added EDs, hospital closures or data drop-offs.

The system collects age, sex, zip code and billed charges of the patient, as well as hospital names and discharge diagnoses and procedure codes. The data have potential value for monitoring the severity of outbreaks such as influenza but not for prospective surveillance: Reporting to CHARS is manual, not real-time, and there is roughly a 9-month lag in release of information by the state. In 2005, Public Health*Seattle & King County (PHSKC) requested that hospitals report pneumonia and influenza admissions (based on both admission and discharge codes) directly to the PHSKC biosurveillance system; data elements included hospital name, date/time of admission, age, sex, home zip code, chief complaint, disposition and diagnoses. In 2008, reporting was revised to collect separate admission and discharge diagnoses, whether the patient was intubated or was in the ICU and a patient/visit key.

Introduction People usually celebrate holidays by inviting family and friends to have food at home or by gathering and eating at restaurants or in other public venues. This increased exposure to food with a common source can create conditions for outbreaks of gastrointestinal illnesses. Holidays can also be targeted by bioterrorists who seek to maximize physical damage, psychological impact and publicity around dates of patriotic or religious significance. They might aim at contaminating food and water supplies, especially with CDC-defined category B agents that can cause diseases such as salmonellosis, shigellosis, cholera, crytosporidiosisand infections with Escherichia coli O157:H7 and the Epsilon toxin of Clostridium perfringens. Hence, there is a need to quantify whether gastrointestinal illnesses increase around holidays. This can also help determine a baseline of the incidence to which future holiday periods should be compared to. This research does not focus on specific reportable diseases. That will be the purpose of forthcoming research. Instead, ED visits with gastrointestinal symptoms are used to leverage the capability of syndromic surveillance for early detection.",

We developed logistic regression (LR) models using part of the data set available. The second part, not previously used for model development, was used for testing. The ROC curve and positive predictive value (PPV) for the test set are shown in Fig. 1 . High specificity is easier to obtain than high sensitivity.

This measure was derived from case-based criteria developed for the Department of Defense ESSENCE (2) and adapted by OPH epidemiologists for the VA population. These criteria are based on separate monitoring of evaluation\\management codes for complex cases, OPH-selected procedure codes, 'bounce-backs' to an emergency setting, patient age distributions anomalous for a VA facility and extreme spikes; case disposition was not yet available. We tested candidate filters by tabulating alert rates and sensitivity to known outbreaks using 13 months of all-VA historical outpatient data.

Lambert (3) introduced the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model to account for excess zeros in counts of manufacturing defects. The use of such model has been applied to innumerous situations. Count data, like contingency tables, often contain cells having zero counts. If a given cell has a positive probability associated to it, a zero count is called a sampling zero.

Simultaneously, HIE records from four Spokane facilities were monitored for flu diagnoses (i.e., records with ICD9 487\u00c1488 listed in the working or final diagnoses) and positive flu laboratory test results (including rapid antigen, DFA, culture or PCR). Records from the NC system and the HIE were matched using facility name, age, gender, county and admission date. The medical records of cases detected by the HIE but not reported through the NC system were evaluated to determine true case status. Sensitivity and PPV were calculated for each surveillance system. Timeliness, completeness and representativeness of records received through the HIE were evaluated against NC reporting.",

Unlike testing methods (1, 2), modeling for spatiotemporal disease surveillance is relatively recent, and this is a very active area of statistical research (3) . Models describing the behavior of diseases in space and time allow covariate effects to be estimated and provide better insight into etiology, spread, prediction and control. Most spatiotemporal models have been developed for retrospective analyses of complete data sets (4). However, data in public health registries accumulate over time and sequential analyses of all the data collected so far is a key concept to early detection of disease outbreaks.

In reality, the staff often 'translates' the statement and adds jargon. Text parsing maps keywords or phrases to specific syndromes. Challenges exist given the vagaries of the English language and local idiomatic usage. Still, CC analysis by text parsing has been successful in civilian settings (1). However, it was necessary to modify the parsing to reflect the characteristics of CAPER data and of the covered population. For example, consider the shock/coma syndrome. Loss of consciousness is relatively common in military settings due to prolonged standing, exertion in hot weather with dehydration, etc., whereas the main concern is shock/coma due to infectious causes. To reduce false positive mappings, the parser now excludes terms such as syncope, fainting, electric shock, road march, parade formation, immunization, blood draw, diabetes, hypoglycemic, etc.",

Two analysts evaluated the sample strings independently and identified key decisions they each used to decide whether the match between the text string and the syndrome was accurate. They then attempted to reconcile those cases where they disagreed. Unresolved differences were reviewed by a DoD consultant who offered revised rules based on clinical experience and known practice patterns among DoD providers. The modified rules were incorporated into the CC parser and tested on miniature data samples for accuracy, and then the CC parser was rerun on the full record set. The cycle of independent analysis and review was repeated with additional modifications to correct any remaining errors followed by a final full run. Before and after contingency tables were used to compare CCbased versus diagnosis-based classifications.

Introduction Spatial cluster analysis is considered an important technique for the elucidation of disease causes and epidemiological surveillance. Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic, defined as a likelihood ratio, is the usual measure of the strength of geographic clusters (1). The circular scan (2), a particular case of the spatial scan statistic, is currently the most used tool for the detection and inference of spatial clusters of disease. Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic for aggregated area maps searches for clusters of cases without specifying their size (number of areas) or geographic location in advance. Their statistical significance is tested while adjusting for the multiple testing inherent in such a procedure. However, as is shown in this work, this adjustment is not done in an even manner for all possible cluster sizes (3).",

Because participation is voluntary, locations of the sentinel providers may not reflect optimal geographic placement. This study analyzes two different geographic placement schemes*a maximal coverage model (MCM) and a K-median model, two location-allocation models commonly used in geographic information systems (GIS) (1). The MCM chooses sites in areas with the densest population. The K-median model chooses sites, which minimize the average distance traveled by individuals to their nearest site. We have previously shown how a placement model can be used to improve population coverage for ILI surveillance in Iowa when considering the sites recruited by the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) (2) . We extend this work by evaluating different surveillance placement algorithms with respect to outbreak intensity and timing (i.e., being able to capture the start, peak and end of the influenza season).",

We use the Huff Model (3) to determine whether or not a case might have been detected by a particular network of sites. Using this scheme, we compare surveillance networks based on outbreak intensity (i.e., which networks detect the highest percentage of cases) and outbreak timing (i.e., which networks detect cases temporally in sync with the true start, peak and end of the disease season). To compare network outbreak timing, we generate the noise parameters of a state space time series model using the expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm implementation provided by Shumway and Stoffer (4).

Mahalanobis Distance is a scale invariant form of Euclidean Distance that also takes correlations of the data set into account. This is an extension of a previously devised Kullback-Leibler Information-based time-series-clustering discrepancy measure (2) . All pairwise distances between cities were then used in a clustering procedure known as QT_Clust (3). This procedure was initially developed for the clustering of high dimensional genomic data. However, QT_Clust may be applied to many time-series-data sets where the trajectory rather than the process of a time series is of interest. A measure of cluster size and within-cluster distance is used to compare how geographically based influenza surveillance performs as opposed to nongeographically based surveillance.",

However, we hypothesize that the relatively high level of travel within the country will affect the pattern of mortality such that cities across the nation may resemble one another more closely than cities within a predefined geographic region. Our approach involved the creation of a discrepancy measure specifically designed for time series data and the application of a clustering routine that seeks to create high quality clusters (rather than high-inclusion clusters). The largest cluster held roughly a third of the observed cities and yet still had a low within-cluster distance when compared to the geographic census regions. This result suggests that many cities observe similar influenza and pneumonia mortality patterns despite varying geographical locations. There are several limitations to this study. First, while our discrepancy works well in the presence of missing data, a preponderance of consecutive missing time points can negatively affect performance. We determined that 25 cities out of the original 122 cities reported too sporadically for analysis. Furthermore, our clustering technique depends upon the arbitrary selection of a 'quality criterion' that is very data driven. High quality clusters can be obtained, but this often leads to a large number of clusters. Conversely, a small number of clusters can be obtained by lowering the quality criterion. Future work will determine if we can use this time-seriesclustering approach to find repeatable clusters that may or may not suggest changes to current geographic boundaries in an effort to coordinate future influenza surveillance activities.

Information was collected through structured questionnaire by trained data abstractor and entered into Microsoft Access software. On the basis of research hypotheses, specific data chunk was extracted and analyzed in SPSS (Statistical Package of Social Sciences) software. Impact in clinical practice Before this database, there was no way to monitor mortality and morbidity. Fortunately, with the development of database, postsurgery mortality and morbidity rates could easily be generated. It helped in development of strict enforcement of protocol to reduce the mortality and morbidity rates. It also helped in controlling preventable postsurgery complications. It also helps in identification of a gap inpatient knowledge regarding the use of warfarin after heart valve surgery and deficiencies in laboratory capabilities, both causing catastrophic complications. As a result, we modified our practice in an effort to address these issues and reduce the complication rates after heart valve surgery. Furthermore, identification of the need to quantify the midterm functional status of in-person and telephonic interview, resulting in the development of a questionnaire that has been added to our protocol 1-year postsurgery.",

Faced with a rapidly growing number of cases, health authorities notified the EU of a potential public health emergency of international concern and implemented new surveillance systems (2) . Media reports suggested that the public health infrastructure was strained to a breaking point, as hospitals in northern Germany issued appeals for blood donations and transferred cases to hospitals in neighboring states. These problems were compounded by the lack of an effective HUS treatment, causing health officials to resort to an emergency experimental treatment instead. As the outbreak continued to spread, up to 130 cases primarily associated with travel were detected in 13 other European countries (3). The EU responded by implementing a new case definition twice over the course of 1 month, to allow for effective surveillance and treatment of cases (3, 4) . By June 29, an investigation launched by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) had determined that contaminated fenugreek seeds imported from Egypt were the most probable source of the outbreak (3, 5) . Previous efforts to locate the source of infection had failed, resulting in strained trade relations and major economic losses among EU member states (3). On July 26, Germany's Robert Koch Institute (RKI) declared the outbreak over and reported a cumulative total of 4321 EHEC cases, including 852 HUS cases and 52 fatalities (6) .",

The NC DETECT Web application provides access to aggregate and line listing analyses customized to users' respective jurisdictions. The most active users are state-level epidemiologists (DPH) and hospital-based public health epidemiologists (PHEs). The use of NC DETECT is included in PHE job descriptions, and functionality has been developed specifically to meet their surveillance needs, including data entry of aggregated laboratory results for flu and respiratory panels. Interviews of local health department (LHD) users completed as part of an evaluation project have suggested that functionality specifically tailored to LHDs may increase their use of the NC DETECT Web application (1). As of June 2011, there were 139 LHD users with active NC DETECT accounts (out of 384 total users with active accounts). Methods Initial information-gathering sessions were held with DPH stakeholders on April 7 and 12, 2011. Mock-ups based on these meetings were discussed with LHD focus groups on April 13 and 14 via Web conference. A later version of the prototype was shown in person at a health department epidemiology team meeting on May 13, and feedback from that meeting was incorporated into the initial release of the dashboards, which were made available to LHD users on June 14, 2011. On June 21, 2011, drill down functionality was added to the dashboards, and on June 30, 2011, the dashboards were made available to DPH users.

NPDS is owned and operated by the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC). Since 2001, scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collaborated with AAPCC to use NPDS for surveillance of chemical, poison and radiological exposures. In March 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami damaged the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan, causing a radiological incident classified as a 'major accident' according to the International Nuclear Event Scale. The incident resulted in the release of radioactive iodine (I\u00c1131) into the global environment, which was detected in precipitation in parts of the United States. While no adverse health effects were expected, concerned citizens contacted public health officials at the local, state and federal levels. Many started to acquire and use potassium iodide (KI) and other iodide-containing products intended for thyroid protection from I\u00c1131, even though this was not a public health recommendation by state and federal public health agencies. Shortly after international media coverage began, regional PCs began receiving calls regarding the Japan radiological incident. State and federal health officials were interested in identifying health communication needs and targeting risk communication messages to address radiation concerns and KI usage recommendations as part of the public health response. This was done in part through NPDS-based surveillance.",

Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from each patient presenting with ILI to test for influenza subtypes including influenza A (H1, H3 and H1N1) and influenza B by RT-PCR. Samples negative for influenza were tested for other respiratory viruses including rhinovirus, metapneumovirus (MPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) and adenovirus by RT-PCR by Luminex.

We propose an approach to transform this stream of raw vital measurements into a sparse sequence of discrete events. Each such event represents significant departure of an observed vital sequence from the null distribution learned from reference data. Any substantial departure may be indicative of an upcoming adverse health episode. Our method searches the space of such events for correlations with near-future changes in health status. Automatically extracted events with significant correlations can be used to predict impending undesirable changes in the patient's health. The ultimate goal is to equip ICU physicians with a surveillance tool that will issue probabilistic alerts of upcoming patient status escalations in sufficient advance to take preventative actions before undesirable conditions actually set in.",

These moments correspond to circumstances in which the observed spectral decomposition of a vital sign does not match what is expected. We consider each such event as potentially informative of near-future deteriorations in the patient's health status. We quantify the predictive utility of each type of these automatically extracted events using training data, which contain actual health alerts, in addition to the vital signs data. To accomplish the task, we perform an exhaustive search across all pairs of CuSum event types (inputs) and alert types (outputs) and identify pairs with high values of the lift statistic (2). Input-output pairs with lifts significantly greater than 1.0 can be expected to enable prediction of health status alerts. Fig. 1 depicts an example result obtained with the presented method. The CuSum Events (green spikes) obtained for the 9th principal component of Modified Chest Lead 1 (MCL1) signal, and the alerts (red spikes) are critical apnea conditions.

Therefore, we developed a novel conceptual framework and toolset that objectively measured opportunities and challenges to inform decision-making, specifically about future implementation of the Electronic Integrated Disease Surveillance System (EIDSS)*a computer-based system for national reporting and monitoring of reportable human and veterinary infectious diseases*in East Africa and the Middle East.",

Novel emerging infections may have very specific and anomalous symptoms, which should be easy to detect even if the number of cases is small. However, typical spatial scan approaches may fail to detect a novel outbreak if the resulting cases are not classified to any known prodrome.

We compare three variants of the semantic scan: static (topics are learned from historical data and do not change from day to day), dynamic (topics are recalculated each day using the most recent two weeks of data) and incremental (not only using the static topics but also learning additional 'emerging' topics that differ substantially from the static topics).",

We first considered 55 different outbreak types, corresponding to all distinct ICD-9 codes with at least 10 cases, which were mapped to one of the existing prodromes. For each outbreak type, we generated spatially localized injects with chief complaints sampled from the cases with that ICD-9 code (Fig. 1) . The static, dynamic and incremental methods required an average of 7.7, 7.1 and 6.9 days, respectively, to detect and were able to precisely characterize the outbreak based on the detected topic (e.g., top keywords for ICD-9 code 569.3 were 'rectal', 'bleed', and 'bleeding'). The prodrome method achieved more timely detection (5.0 days to detect) but with much less precise characterization (e.g., 'hemorrhagic' for ICD-9 code 569.3). Next, we considered both randomly selected, unmapped ICD-9 codes and synthetically generated unprecedented events, such as an outbreak that makes the patient's nose turn green. The prodrome method required 10.9 days to detect these outbreaks, while the semantic scan was able to achieve much faster detection. For example, for the green nose outbreak, the static, dynamic and incremental methods detected in 6.4, 5.3 and 5.6 days, respectively. The dynamic and incremental methods correctly identified the emerging topic (keywords 'green', 'nose', 'nasal', etc.), while the static method did not, since the outbreak did not correspond to any of the topics learned from historical data.",

Thus, it is essential to make a plan on activation of the system in advance in case a severe disaster occurs and to prepare and stockpile the hardware that is necessary for an early activation of evacuation site surveillance. The necessary hardware, for example, includes battery and communication tool even if electronic power, internet and (mobile) phone network are shut down. This is the next challenge. ",

Several visualization tools were developed to assist in analyzing and characterizing data quality patterns for each site: upload pattern graphs (Fig. 1) , stacked lag histograms and arrays of lagged time series graphs. Upload pattern graphs are heat maps comparing upload dates with encounter dates (an example figure is given below for three sites). Stacked lag histograms provide a succinct view of the complete distribution of data timeliness for a particular site. Arrays of lagged time series graphs provide an in-depth look at how timeliness patterns manifest in time series graphs. Implementation of the latter two visualizations required implementing a specific database architecture to enable reconstruction of the data at any prior upload date.",

Early studies focused on prediction of an outbreak; however, further investigation of patient resource utilization would be helpful in developing an action plan for addressing community and patient needs during future outbreaks. There is a paucity of research comparing ED and urgent care utilization rates during the 2009 Novel H1N1 pandemic, though there are regional data suggesting that urgent care centers bore a larger portion of the burden of H1N1 influenza than EDs (2) . Furthermore, one group found that ILI-related phone calls to urgent care centers predicted influenza outbreak at least 1 week ahead of peaks in the ILI hospital care consultation rates (3) . ED data on its own have proven useful for public health disease surveillance (4, 5) , and many studies group urgent care and ED care together. The literature is lacking subgroup analysis of these two very different care environments. Understanding the correlation between urgent care and ED utilization rates will provide a more in depth understanding of the stress that the 2009 Fall Novel H1N1 placed on community resources in our geographic region.",

We evaluated syndrome validity over two distinct time periods: (1) the ''discrete'' 2003\u00c104 influenza season, which had relatively less co-circulation of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) compared to most years, and (2) the ''concomitant'' 2000\u00c105 influenza seasons (excluding 2003\u00c104), when influenza and RSV co-circulation was high. Analyses during the concomitant years were further stratified by age B5 years and ]5 years. Multiple imputation was used to address missing viral lab results. The imputation model was based on testing guidelines in place at the hospital during the time of study.",

Greater sensitivity and false positive fractions (1-specificity) tended to be produced by the febrile definitions than by the ILI definitions; and by definitions derived from CC or diagnoses as compared to those from CC alone.

ED ILI may provide a more robust estimate of the burden of disease than laboratory surveillance, which captures only a subset of patients seen by a healthcare provider and who were tested. The higher specificity of the ILI definitions suggests it is best used for situational awareness during influenza outbreaks and for distinguishing influenza from other viral agents. The use of several definitions throughout the season may be most appropriate in some settings. Public health practitioners should bear in mind that syndrome performance may vary by season and year. Higher syndrome specificity among older children suggests specificity in adults should be higher than that observed for younger populations. However, the generalizability of these results to adult populations and other hospitals is uncertain and should be further studied.",

These challenges are more pronounced in developing countries, which bear the greatest burden of disease and where new pathogens are more likely to emerge, old ones to reemerge and drug-resistant strains to propagate. In August 2008, a mobile phone-based surveillance system was piloted in 6 of the 23 districts in the state of AP in India. Health workers in 3832 hospitals and health centers used mobile phones to send reports to and receive information from the nationwide Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP). Like in many other states, the IDSP in AP is facing many operational constraints like lack of human resource, irregular supply of logistics, hard to reach health facilities, poor coordination with various health programs and poor linkages with nonstate stakeholders. The mobile phone-based surveillance system was an attempt to tackle some of the barriers to improving the IDSP by capitalizing on the exponential growth in numbers as well as reach of mobile phones in the state. Promising results from the pilot of the system led AP state to extend it to about 16,000 reporting units in all 23 districts. This study evaluates how the system has affected the efficiency and effectiveness of IDSP in the state.",

First, it faces the problem of multiplicity from multiple testing. Also, the ignorance of CBS reduces the performance of outbreak detection if data are truly correlated. Finally, since health data are normally dependent over time, CWS is another issue that should be taken into account. Sufficient reduction methods are used to reduce the dimensionality of a simple multivariate series to a univariate series, which has been proved to be sufficient for monitoring a mean shift in multivariate surveillance (1, 2) . Having considered the sufficiency property and the nature of health data, we propose a sufficient reduction method for detecting a mean shift in multivariate series where CWS and CBS are taken into account. (2) proposed a sufficient reduction method used for monitoring a mean shift in multivariate series where observations are assumed independent. Also, the former allows for CBS while the latter does not. In this study, we further develop sufficient reduction methods by taking CWS and CBS into account. At each time point, data from p-dimensional multivariate series are used to calculate sufficient statistics derived from the likelihood ratio between out of control and in control states. The evaluation of this method is by simulation study, where bivariate series are generated daily from different sets of parameters (whether or not CWS and/or CBS are present) (3). Detection of a mean shift, which is 2, 3 or 4 times standard deviation of background data, is investigated. A EWMA chart is used to monitor the resultant series of sufficient statistics, and the conditional expected delays (CED) and false alarm rates (FAR) (4) from four methods are compared.",

This effect violates the assumptions of EWMA chart, for which data are assumed to be independent and then produces a high FAR.

We normalize each score by dividing by the maximum unconstrained subset score for that training example (computed efficiently using LTSS). We then compute the mean normalized score averaged over all training examples. If a given graph is close to the true underlying structure, then its maximum constrained score will be close to the maximum unconstrained score for many training examples, while if the graph is missing essential connections, then the maximum constrained score given that structure will be much lower than the maximum unconstrained score. Any graph with a large number of edges will also score close to the maximum unconstrained score.

Modified Shewhart charting was developed with dynamic system modeling using a knowledge base technique. Community health status was charted with a set of state syndrome variables and dynamic processes, where baselines, thresholds, trend analysis and alerts from historic data were automatically charted (1). This technical framework was implemented in STEMS with OTC data, school absentee data and occupational health data, then later in AHEDD. The AHEDD system also used the Real-Time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance CoCo chief complaint classifier with electronic data feeds from four hospitals. AHEDD was later expanded to include drill down custom querying for all 26 acute care hospitals (allowing NH to realize statewide ED surveillance).",

It has been suggested that the syphilis epidemic in the United States is a 'rare example of unforced, endogenous oscillations in disease incidence, with an 8\u00c111-year period that is predicted by the natural dynamics of syphilis infection, to which there is partially protective immunity' (1). While the time series of aggregate case counts seems to support this claim, between 1990 and 2010, there seems to have been a significant change in the spatial distribution of the syphilis epidemic. It is unclear if this change can also be attributed to 'endogenous' factors or whether it is due to exogenous factors such as behavioral changes (e.g., the widespread use of the internet for anonymous sexual encounters). For example, it is pointed out that levels of syphilis in 1989 were abnormally high in counties in North Carolina (NC) immediately adjacent to highways (2) . The hypothesis was that this may be due to truck drivers and prostitution and/or the emerging cocaine market (1). Our results indicate that syphilis distribution in NC has changed since 1989, diffusing away from highway counties (see Fig. 1 ).",

Surveillance is a critical aspect of pandemic preparedness for early case detection (2) . Identification of the index cases of a pandemic virus can trigger public health mitigation efforts (3) . To develop an appropriate surveillance process, it is important to understand the two possibilities of pandemic evolution. A new pandemic may begin with mild cases, during which surveillance should be concentrated on work/school absenteeism and in physician offices. The other possibility begins with severe cases, characterized by sCAP, respiratory failure and ICU admission. As the syndrome of pneumonia is not reportable to health agencies for public health surveillance, a year-round, hospital-based surveillance mechanism may be an important tool for early case detection in the event of an epidemic of sCAP. To fill these gaps, we developed a statewide, hospital-based surveillance network for sCAP surveillance in Kentucky.",

Information regarding ADEs is reported to the medical community in peer-reviewed journals. However, in most cases, there is significant lag in the publication of peer-reviewed articles concerning ADEs. Within medical journals, our intuition is that letters to the editor may provide the earliest reports of ADEs. They often report single case reports or a collection of cases and usually precede more formal investigations and reports. Although these letters may contain useful and timely information, the challenge is that letters to the editor may be 'buried' inside print journals. Furthermore, they may be more difficult to find and access even when using electronic searches because unlike other published reports, there is no corresponding abstract to view. Due to the lack of an abstract, detection depends almost exclusively upon words in a title or manually applied Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). We propose that searching the full text of letters to the editor can provide a faster and perhaps more complete detection of ADEs compared to searches based on MeSH terms or titles alone.",

We restricted the letters to those that had the MeSH term 'adverse effect' in the indexing data.

For example, some of the letters had MeSH terms like ''Adverse Effect'' but no mention of adverse effects in the letter.

The Oscour network constitutes a part of the system, based on the emergency departments. Starting in 2004 with 23 ED, the network progressively enhances with the participation of new ED. In 2011, 55% of national attendances are daily recorded in the system, covering 25 of the 26 French regions. The daily fluctuations of the ED visits are monitored by age groups, syndromes and geographical levels. Numerous factors may influence the daily fluctuations of the number of ED attendances. A predictive model relating the temporal factors and the daily attendances is proposed. Methods The study consists in a time-series analysis of the daily number of all causes attendances in 23 ED in Paris area, included in the Oscour network, from 2007 to 2010. After a prior descriptive analysis of temporal variables, a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) has been developed, and the parameters have been estimated using data from 2007 to 2009. Different combinations of variables have been tested to find the most predictive model. The goodness-of-fit was measured using the R 2 and BIC indicators and by comparing the observed and estimated number of visits. The predictive performances of the model have been assessed by comparing the expected number of attendances provided by the model with the observed number of visits in 2010. The statistical analysis has been extended by age group.",

These districts and municipalities represent a mix of high and low Fiscal Capacity of the local governments and high and low Economic Capacity of the population. MNCH S-R Systems strengthening was carried out by means of two 2-day training sessions (of approximately 1 year apart) at the District/Municipal Health Offices (D/M HOs) and consultations via electronic telecommunication. The subject matter of the training sessions courses and consultations consisted of: (1) controlling MNCH priority diseases; (2) applying S-R core and support functions by the D/M HO and health service providers; (3) managing a S-R Support Unit at the D/M HO; and, (4) setting up a D/M HO internet website and publishing S-R electronic bulletins (1, 2).",

With the rise of social networks like Twitter, topic detection has begun leveraging measures of user influence to identify emerging events. Twitter's highly skewed follower/followee structure lends itself to an intuitive model of influence; yet, in a context like the Emerging Infections Network (EIN), a sentinel surveillance listserv of over 1400 infectious disease experts, developing a useful model of authority becomes less clear. Who should we listen to on the EIN? To explore this, we annotated a body of important EIN discussions and tested how well 3 models of user authority performed in identifying those discussions.",

Cardiothoracic surgery quality improvement is a core value of healthcare provision. In order to improve quality of care, information on key indicators needs to be systematically collected and maintained. In 2006, the cardiothoracic department at AgaKhan University developed an infrastructure that would enable us to answer the more challenging research queries in cardiac surgery practice. The resulting electronic cardiothoracic database is based on the European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgeons database and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database. While, it is currently used only at Aga Khan University, it has the potential to become a multicenter database.",

This provides an opportunity to capture data and conduct simple interventions on specific subjects amenable to basic evaluation. Given the sensitive nature of pathogen-specific data, we focus on nondisease-specific interventions leading to the reduction of exposure to and release of any given hazard. Here, we present an opportunistic approach for capturing data, at no additional cost, to assess (i) baseline awareness of on-farm biosecurity measures among UZ veterinary officials and (ii) the impact of training on their awareness of biosecurity.

Here, we focus on impact. Specifically relating to biosecurity on farm, we aim to assess the impact at the training events through interactive presentations that allow the elicitation of trainees' views on what are the most common biosecurity breaches in their regions of origin, the measures they recommend and the barriers that prevent their implementation. At the end of the session, trainees discuss the most common biosecurity breaches to produce a check list that they can use the next time they visit farms.",

The intervention would be in the form of advice from the visiting official and the provision of a limited amount of materials to support the implementation of biosecurity measures (e.g., poster with biosecurity messages, log book, etc.). Later visits to the farm by the official will aim to record the number of breaches and allow comparisons with the baseline. Results from this study could be taken as a proxy measure of the ROI from the training efforts.The model of opportunistic data collection at trainings can be extended to advise other nonsensitive areas, such as some of the technical attributes of the surveillance system (timeliness, etc.). Other extensions are possible by means of expanding generic frameworks, like the one discussed here, into disease-specific ones either to assess biosecurity or the risk pathways to the introduction of a pathogen into the country, a region or a farm.",

During the study period, a high proportion of zeros and some large positive counts were observed in most of the 66 surveillance locations. Among the four candidate distributions (Poisson, NB, ZIP and ZINB), we find that the ZINB distribution is most frequently favored in terms of Akaike's information criterion (AIC) (3) . In contrast, we find that the Poisson distribution is never selected for any of the surveillance locations (Table 1) .",
