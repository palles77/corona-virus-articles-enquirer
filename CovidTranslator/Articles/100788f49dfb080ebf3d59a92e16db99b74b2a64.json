            "text": "Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have a potential to differentiate into neurons in addition to lineages of mesoderm. Protocols in published papers for the differentiation of hMSCs into neuron cells are highlighted by the combined use of various growth factors, cytokines, and even chemicals in the induction medium. In the present work, hMSCs were directed to neural differentiation by applying an alkaline medium with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Results from RT-PCR disclosed that some neuron-specific genes including NeuroD were exclusively expressed in the differentiated cells. Changes of proteome profiling by neural induction was observed with the conventional proteomic method using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry. Differentially expression of intracellular proteomes between hMSCs and differentiated cells was evident. Using the intracellular proteome of MSCs before induction as the basis, 8 proteins were found to be up-regulated and 11 proteins were down-regulated in the proteome of MSCs after neural induction for 21 days. Among them, the Alzheimer's disease related mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme MnSOD increased about twenty-one times in the differentiated cells. The 2-DE was also used to profile the proteins secreted by hMSCs and differentiated cells. Proteins exclusively appeared in the differentiated cells include MAP6 which has the ability to repair synapses and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP-7) which can regulate PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. In addition, hMSCs modified with targeting DNA hypermethylation of genes in Salvador/Warts/Hippo (SWH) pathway were also studied for the neural differentiation. Although the SWH knockout hMSCs were found to have higher rates of expansion and differentiation, their neural differentiation pattern was very similar to that of intact hMSCs. (1) . The enhancement of virus production is essential for the development of an efficient vaccine production process. In this study, the stimulating agents for improvement of PEDV production was searched. We tested stimulating agents such as antioxidant, ascorbic acid, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), polyamine, geneticin, neomycin, DEAE-dextran, poly-L-lysine, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and sodium butyrate (NaBu) (2, 3) . NaBu, known as inhibitor of histone deacetylases, was the strongest of these stimulating agents. After addition of NaBu, cell density was rapidly decreased, but virus production was stimulated. In PEDV production for high (0.1) and low (0.0001) MOI, the optimum treatment times of NaBu were different in each MOI because of different optimum harvest times. The optimum time of NaBu treatment in high and low MOI were 0 and 36 h of postinfection, respectively.",

This fusion protein was produced inducibly by sugar starvation and secreted into the culture media with signal peptide. After secretion during production phase, hCTLA4Ig is degraded by proteases (1). To achieve higher recovery, it is important to separate target protein from the medium containing proteases and prevent degradation of target protein by proper purification process. Affinity chromatography using Streamline rProtein A has been widely used to purify monoclonal antibodies and Fc fusion proteins. Determination of the dynamic capacity of rProtein A is essential for the optimization of a packed-bed affinity chromatography. The dynamic capacity depends on many factors including the flow rate, resin height, pH and temperature (2) . In this study, binding flow rate as a major parameter was examined. XK16/20 column was packed with 20 mL Streamline rProtein A. The purity and yield in each step were observed with binding flow rate of 100, 200, and 300 cm/h, respectively. This small-scale protein A chromatography was performed by KTA explorer FPLC. It was found that the purity and yield were influenced by changing binding flow rate.",
