It is characterized by the features of acute encephalopathy such as seizure, alteration of consciousness, and symmetric involvement of the bilateral thalamus on neuroimaging tests. Although most ANE cases have occurred sporadically, familial or recurrent ANE has been reported in Caucasian patients, with genetic susceptibility to ANE noted in some patients due to a RANBP2 mutation. We report the cases of two Korean siblings with typical ANE and RANBP2 mutation.",

Seven hours after the first seizure, she developed repetitive seizures and unresponsiveness and became comatose. She was admitted to the intensive care unit with hypotension and respiratory compromise. Laboratory findings, including liver function tests and ammonia levels, were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was normal except for an elevated protein level (protein: 523 mg/dl, glucose: 93 mg/dl). The patient was empirically started on vancomycin, cefotaxime, and acyclovir to treat possible meningoencephalitis. Computed tomography (CT) revealed low attenuation in the bilateral thalamus and diffuse effacement of the sulci and lateral ventricles, indicating diffuse cerebral edema ( Fig. 1 ). Despite treatment in intensive care and immunosuppressive therapy including intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day for 2 days) and immunoglobulin (1 g/kg/day for 2 days), the patient died 2 days after the onset of initial neurological symptoms. Results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for respiratory viruses (parainfluenza, influenza, corona virus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, bocavirus, and enterovirus) and herpes simplex viruses in the CSF as well as the results from cultures for bacteria in the CSF, serum, and urine were all negative.",

In 2009, Neilson et al. reported multiple affected family members with acute necrotizing encephalopathy [2] .

However, there are case reports of familial and recurrent ANE without RANBP2 mutation, suggesting a heterogeneous genetic contribution to ANE [7] .
