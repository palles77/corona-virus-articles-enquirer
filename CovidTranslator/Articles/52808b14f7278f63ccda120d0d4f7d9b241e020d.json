            "text": "Technically, any high-rise building with more than one occupancy can be considered a mixed-use facility. For example, an office building that has a cafeteria and an observation deck; a hotel building that has a shopping arcade, restaurants, and a movie theater; and a residential and apartment building that has retail shops and a health club open to the public. Each occupancy within each respective facility manages its own operations and is managed overall by the building owner and manager. For the purposes of this chapter, each of the three major occupancies-office, hotel, and residential-are housed separately from each other. They operate autonomously, and yet overall are still managed by the same building owner and manager. 1 Olmsted L. Hotel residences: all the perks, none of the work. USA Today.

Inherent in this is the likelihood or probability of the threat occurring and the consequences of the occurrence. Thus, a very high likelihood of occurrence with very small consequences may require simple [,] low cost mitigation measures [countermeasures] , but a very low likelihood of occurrence with very grave consequences may require more costly and complex mitigation measures. The risk assessment should provide a relative risk profile. High-risk combinations of assets against associated threats, with identified vulnerability, allow prioritization of resources to implement mitigation measures.\" 3 Key steps in the process involve examining the assets, the threats against the assets, the vulnerabilities of the assets, and the countermeasures or mitigation measures that can be used to address identified vulnerabilities of the assets (within the confines of risk management). These areas are now examined for mixed-use buildings.",

These countermeasures need to be looked at in terms of security design. \"Security design involves the systematic integration of design, technology, and operation\u2026. The process of designing security into architecture is known as Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED).\" 15 As mentioned previously, the key to selecting appropriate countermeasures for a particular facility is for a risk assessment to be conducted. (See Chapter 4.) Because fire is a risk in high-rise buildings, the following is noted regarding their fire protection features: mixed-use buildings that have properly designed, installed, operated, tested, and maintained automatic fire detection and suppression systems, and other fire protection features-automatic closing fire doors for compartmentation and maintenance of the integrity of occupant escape routes, and automatic smoke control systems to restrict the spread of smoke-do have the necessary early warning systems to quickly detect fires and warn occupants of their presence, as well as the necessary automated sprinkler systems to quickly extinguish a fire in its early stages.

For high-rise buildings, automatic extinguishing systems are associated with a reduction of at least 88% in the rate of deaths per 1,000 fires for each of the three property classes (excluding office buildings, which had no deaths recorded in NFIRS [National Fire Incident Reporting System] in high-rise buildings) and at least 44% in the average dollar loss per fire for each of the four property classes. Fire detection equipment is associated with a reduction of 55% in the rate of deaths per 1,000 fires in apartment buildings. Fire-resistive construction is associated with a reduction of 30% in average dollar loss per fire in apartment buildings. This probably is produced not directly by the construction but indirectly by the compartmentation features that tend to be used with fire-resistive construction, features that keep more fires smaller and so keep property losses lower. (Note, though, that compartmentation practices probably vary more by type of occupancy than by type of construction.) Because high-rise buildings often use all three systems, it is very difficult to try to separate their effects on loss rates, and many rates are very sensitive to deaths or large dollar loss in individual incidents.",
