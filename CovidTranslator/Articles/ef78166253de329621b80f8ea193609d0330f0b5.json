            "text": "Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) infection causes acute atrophic enteritis in the turkey poults, leading to significant economic loss in the U.S. turkey industry. Rapid detection, differentiation, and quantitation of TCoV are critical to the diagnosis and control of the disease. A specific one-step real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) assay for detection and quantitation of TCoV in the turkey tissues was developed using a dual-labeled fluorescent probe. The fluorogenic probe labeled with a reporter dye (FAM, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamin) and a quencher dye (AbsoluteQuencher TM ) was designed to bind to a 186 base-pair fragment flanked by the two PCR primers targeting the 3 end of spike gene of TCoV. The assay was performed on different avian viruses and bacteria to determine the specificity as well as serial dilutions of TCoV for the sensitivity. Three animal trials were conducted to further validate the assay. Ten-day-old turkey poults were inoculated orally with 100 EID 50 of TCoV. Intestinal tissues (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum), feces from the cloacal swabs, or feces from the floor were collected at 12 h, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and/or 14 days post-inoculation (DPI). RNA was extracted from each sample and subjected to the RRT-PCR. The designed primers and probe were specific for TCoV. Other non-TCoV avian viruses and bacteria were not amplified by RRT-PCR. The assay was highly sensitive and could quantitate between 10 2 and 10 10 copies/l of viral genome. The viral RNA in the intestine segments reached the highest level, 6 \u00d7 10 15 copies/l, in the jejunum at 5 DPI. Eighty-four intestine segments assayed by the developed RRT-PCR and immunofluorescence antibody assay (IFA) revealed that there were 6 segments negative for TCoV by both assays, 45 positive for TCoV by IFA, and 77 positive for TCoV by RRT-PCR. Turkey coronavirus was detected in the feces from the cloacal swabs or floor 1-14 DPI; however, the viral RNA load varied among different turkey poults at different intervals from different trials. The highest amount of viral RNA, 2.8 \u00d7 10 10 copies/l, in the feces was the one from the cloacal swab collected at 1 DPI. The average amount of TCoV RNA in the cloacal fecal samples was 10 times higher than that in the fecal droppings on the floor. Taken together, the results indicated that the developed RRT-PCR assay is rapid, sensitive, and specific for detection, differentiation, and quantitation of TCoV in the turkey tissues and should be helpful in monitoring the progression of TCoV induced acute enteritis in the turkey flocks.",

            "text": "Turkey coronavirus belongs to the antigenic group 3 in the family Coronaviridae. It is a pleomorphic enveloped virus with the size about 80-160 nm in diameter. There are 20 nm long club-shaped projections around the virions. The genomic nucleic acid is a linear, positive sense, single stranded RNA. The major structural proteins include spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The S protein is highly variable among different coronaviruses while M and N protein are more conserved between different antigenic groups. The S proteins of coronaviruses have been reported to form peplomer structures on the surface of coronavirus, which bind to cell receptors and induce cell fusion and neutralizing antibodies (Lu et al., 2004) . The similarity of S gene nucleotide and amino acid sequence among coronaviruses varies. Although TCoV and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) are in the same antigenic group, the S gene nucleotide sequence of TCoV only share 30-40% homology to that of IBV (Lin et al., 2004) . The amino terminal S1 region of several coronaviruses has been reported to contain the receptor binding domain. It can bind to cellular receptors, induce neutralizing antibodies, and determine host specificity and tropism (Hwang et al., 2006; Sheahan et al., 2008) . The carboxyl terminal S2 region consisting of transmembrane domain can induce cell fusion and viral assembly (Broer et al., 2006; Howard et al., 2008) . The S2 gene is more conserved than S1 gene between different coronaviruses and between different strains or isolates of the same coronavirus (Cavanagh, 2005; Lin et al., 2004; Loa et al., 2006a,b) . Therefore, S2 gene is a better target to detect TCoV isolates and differentiate TCoV from other coronaviruses.",

Because there is no cell culture system for TCoV, the virus isolation has to use turkey eggs for propagation of the virus, which is time consuming and labor intensive. Immunofluorescent antibody assay and IP are antibody-based methods. They are simpler and faster than virus isolation but the sensitivity is very low. Since the sequence information of TCoV was available, RT-PCR has been developed and it has high specificity and sensitivity. It has been applied to detect TCoV RNA in fecal samples and intestinal contents of infected turkeys (Breslin et al., 2000; Loa et al., 2006a) .

Twenty-two days old embryonated turkey eggs were inoculated with 200 l of the filtrate via amniotic route and embryo intestines were harvested after 3 days of incubation. Harvested embryo intestines were processed and propagated as described above for 5 passages. Intestines of TCoV-infected turkey embryos in the fifth passage were prepared as 20% suspension in PBS. The suspension was homogenized, clarified, filtered as described above, and used as inoculum. The titer of virus in the inoculum was determined by inoculation of the suspension at 10fold dilutions into groups of five 22-day-old embryonated turkey eggs. The 50% embryo infectious dose (EID 50 ) was calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (Loa et al., 2001; Reed and Muench, 1938; Senne, 2008 ).

The designed primers and probe can distinguish TCoV from other pathogens, including E. coli, Salmonella, rotavirus, reovirus, enterovirus, avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, turkey herpesvirus, and other coronaviruses (CCoV, BCoV, TGEV, FIPV, and IBV). Based on the studies by IFA, immunoperoxidase (IP) procedures, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and sequence analysis, there is a close antigenic and genomic relationship between TCoV and IBV (Akin et al., 2001; Guy et al., 1997; Lin et al., 2002; Loa et al., 2000; Stephensen et al., 1999) . In addition, experimental infection studies using the animals have showed that TCoV could replicate in the enteric tissues of chickens without causing clinical signs (Gelb et al., 1987; Guy, 2000) , BCoV could replicate in the intestines of turkeys with no or mild clinical diseases (Dea et al., 1991; Ismail et al., 2001) , and IBV could maintain in the blood of infected turkeys up to 48 h via intravenous inoculation (Gelb et al., 1987) . Thus, rapid, accurate, and specific detection of TCoV is critical to the control and eradication of turkey enteritis in the turkey flocks. Two RRT-PCR assays for the detection of avian enteritis viruses have been reported and could be applied to the detection of TCoV. One assay was designed to target M gene of TCoV and the other was targeted 5 un-translated region of IBV genome. However, both gene sequences are conserved between TCoV and IBV (Callison et al., 2006; Spackman et al., 2005) . There- fore, both assays could not detect TCoV differentially. The present study targeted the unique region of TCoV S gene that is specific to TCoV and conserved among various TCoV isolates and could detect, differentiate, and quantitate TCoV specifically.",

The standard curve was generated for each independent run of samples for the accuracy of absolute quantification. The limit of detection of TCoV-specific RRT-PCR assay was as low as 10 2 copies/l, more sensitive than that by using RRT-PCR assay targeting M gene of TCoV in which the detection limit for a single target test in TCoV was 1100 copies and for multiplex with the genes of other enteric viruses was 2200 copies (Spackman et al., 2005) . In addition, one advantage of the TCoV-specific RRT-PCR assay in the present study was the wide range of linearity of standard curve from 10 2 to 10 10 copies, rendering the application of such assay to different kinds of specimens with various levels of virus load.",

In the present study, experimentally infected intestinal tissues, cloacal fecal samples, and/or fecal droppings were collected and subjected to the analysis by IFA and RRT-PCR, respectively. Six out of the total 84 samples collected at 12 h and 1 day post-inoculation in the trial 1 were tested negative for TCoV by both assays. The viral load in those samples could be expected too low to be detected by these two assays. Thirty-two samples that had low concentration of TCoV were only detected positive by RRT-PCR but not by IFA, indicating RRT-PCR is more sensitive than IFA on the detection of TCoV. There was one sample positive for TCoV by IFA, but negative by RRT-PCR. It may be caused by the loss of TCoV RNA during processing of intestine or during RNA extraction. Furthermore, in addition to specific and sensitive detection of TCoV, RRT-PCR can provide absolute quantitative data of TCoV in tissue specimens.",

The TCoV concentration was significantly lower in the duodenum than that in the jejunum, ileum and cecum. At 3 and 14 dpi, the TCoV level was significantly higher in the ileum than that in the other 3 segments. Therefore, the viral load varied through 14 days after inoculation, but TCoV were concentrated in the jejunum and ileum after 3 dpi. The results were consistent with previous studies showing that TCoV could be detected in the intestinal contents of experimentally inoculated turkeys for up to 6 weeks post-inoculation by virus isolation and 7 weeks post-inoculation by a RT-PCR procedure (Breslin et al., 2000) .",

The dynamic changes of viral load from each turkey from 1 to 14 dpi were most likely related to the replication of the virus, reintroduction of the virus from the environment, the damage of intestinal epithelial cells, or the regeneration of epithelial cells. In the trial 3, TCoV in the fecal droppings on the floor could be detected and quantified by RRT-PCR, but TCoV levels in the fecal droppings were 2 logs less than those from the cloacal fecal swabs. Such findings indicated the possibilities of TCoV RNA degradation in the fecal droppings exposed in the environment. The feasibility of using the cloacal swabs and fecal droppings as the sample sources for specific detection and quantitation of TCoV by RRT-PCR increases the practical application of RRT-PCR in the diagnosis of TCoV in the field situation greatly because necropsy of animals to collect intestinal segments for RRT-PCR can be avoided and the time to carry out RRT-PCR can be shortened.",
