            "text": "Liver Enzyme Activities. The serum activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in newborn and growing puppies and kittens are usually within the normal range or slightly higher than those of healthy adult dogs and cats (Keller, 1981) . The serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activities of 1-to l O-day-old puppies are 20-to 25fold greater than those of healthy adults. Selected laboratory values used as indicators of hepatobiliary dysfunction in newborn and growing puppies and kittens are listed in Table 11 -1. The source of the profound ALP and GGT activity is probably of placental, colostral, and! or intestinal origin. These profound serum ALP and GGT activities after 10 to 14 days postpartum will decrease to moderately increased activities. Although the bone ALP isoenzyme derived from active osteoblast activity may increase the serum ALP activity in growing animals, the magnitude of increase usually is only two-to threefold the normal level (Center et aI, 1995) . Colostrum is rich in both ALP and GGT activity, and it is possible that these enzymes may be absorbed from the colostrum or intestinal tract during the first days of life. Alternatively, the ingestion of colostrum may stimulate intestinal growth and enzyme production. Therefore, colostrum-deprived puppies can be identified by their serum ALP and GGT activity level, particularly during the first week of 200 life, as an indicator of successful ingestion of colostrum. Thus, increased serum ALP and GGT activities cannot be used in the diagnosis of acute liver dysfunction during the first 10 to 14 days of life. Such increases in serum ALP and GGT activities cannot be used to detect colostrum-deprived kittens.",

Cystic lesions may be parenchymal or ductal in origin and may be either solitary or multiple (polycystic). Cystic lesions vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. Congenital hepatic cysts are typically asymptomatic. Rarely, fluid may accumulate in the abdominal cavity as a consequence of cyst rupture or portal hypertension resulting from impingement of major vessels. Cyst contents are usually a clear or modified transudate, although cysts may contain bile or blood. Acquired hepatic cysts are usually solitary, whereas congenital or developmental he- patic cysts are commonly multiple. Polycystic hepatic cysts may be associated with cystic lesions in other organs, most notably the kidneys. Polycystic kidneys and liver have been identified in Cairn terrier dogs and Persian cats during the first few months of life (Crowell et ai, 1979; McKenna and Carpenter, 1980) . Abdominal radiographs may reveal an irregular hepatic margin or focal densities if a few large hepatic or biliary cysts are present. Ultrasonography readily reveals the cystic nature of these lesions and the extent of parenchymal or biliary tract involvement ( Fig. 11-2 ). Treatment is usually not needed for a congenital hepatic cyst unless a large cyst is causing abdominal discomfort or fluid accumulation. If cystic lesions are symptomatic, surgical resection of solitary lesions, partial cyst wall, or a liver lobe may be required.",

The mesenteric portions of the omphalomesenteric veins become the tributaries of the portal vein. Small anastomoses develop between the portal and systemic circulation routes that become the normal portosystemic venous communications (Heath and House, 1970;  Khan and Vitums, 1971; Sleight and Thomford, 1969; Viturns, 1959 ). In the fetus, blood from the umbilical vein flows directly to the caudal vena cava through the ductus venosus, thus bypassing the liver. By passively responding to changes in the systemic or hepatic circulation, the ductus venosus stabilizes the venous return to the fetal heart as the umbilical venous return fluctuates (Edelstone, 1980) . Functional and morphologic closure of the ductus venosus does not occur at the same time after birth (Lohse and Suter, 1977) . Functional closure develops gradually during the second and third days after birth in the puppy. Morphologic closure occurs as the ductus atrophies, resulting in the formation of a thin fibrous band, the ligamentum venosum, within the liver. The ductus closure depends on changes in pressure and resistance across the hepatic vasculature that follows the postnatal obliteration of the umbilical circulation. Morphologic closure of the ductus occurs by 1 to 3 months after birth.",

Normal portal blood flow is relatively uniform and nonpulsatile, average portal blood flow velocity being approximately 15 cm/s in healthy, unsedated puppies. The caudal vena cava normally contains variable blood flow because of the influence of changing right atrial and pleural pressures. In most cases, congenital PSS represents a low resistance pathway for blood to bypass the liver and enter the caudal vena cava. In affected puppies with congenital PSS, the portal vein is exposed to right atrial and pleural pressure changes, and the pattern of portal blood flow may become similar to that noted in the caudal vena cava. Puppies with portal hypertension have reduced mean portal blood flow velocity, which correlates with the presence of multiple extrahepatic anomalous vessels. Puppies with portal hypertension as a result of hepatic arteriovenous fistula have pulsatile hepatofugal flow in the portal vein. Most extrahepatic and intrahepatic congenital PSSs are detectable using two-dimensional, gray-scale ultrasonography; however, use of color-flow Doppler ultrasonography aids in the detection of small extrahepatic shunting vessels. A congenital extrahepatic PSS usually drains into the caudal vena cava close to the cranial pole of the right kidney, and on color-flow images a localized area of turbulent flow in the caudal vena cava indicates the shunt's location. When two-dimensional gray-scale, duplex Doppler, and color-flow Doppler modalities are used in combination, the accuracy for ultrasonographic diagnosis of congenital PSS in puppies and kittens can be at least 94% (Lamb, 1997) .",

This technique can also be used in combination with surgery, in which case the mesenteric vein catheter is also used to measure portal blood pressure during the congenital shunt ligation or attenuation procedure.

The interpositio\u00f5 f the hepatic sinusoids between the heart and fistula. cushions the hemodynamic effects, influencing heart function in animals with congenital hepatic arteriovenous fistulas. Animals with congenital hepatic arteriovenous fistulas have multiple portosystemic shunts and ascites.

Diagnosis is made by nonselective Jugular venography , selective celiac angiography, technetium scintigraphy, ultrasonography, or observation of an abnormal liver lobe during laparotomy. Affected liver lobes are large and may have numerous pulsating surface vessels. Unaffected liver lobes are small. A continuous murmur accentuated during systole may be auscultated near the lesion. Palpation of the area may reveal a thrill.

Most dogs with microvascular dysplasia are asymptomatic, probably because only a small amount of blood is being shunted away from the liver. When signs are present, they are similar to those seen in dogs with congenital extrahepatic and intrahepatic PSS, with the exception that most dogs with microvascular dysplasia usually present at an older age. The most prominent laboratory abnormality is increased serum bile acid concentrations. There is no ultrasonographic, sur-gical, or portographic evidence of a congenital PSS, and the rectal portal scintigraphy is normal. Medical treatment is the same as for any suspected congenital PSS. Asymptomatic dogs with increased serum bile acids as their only detectable abnormality do not require treatment.",

The mucopolysaccharide storage disorders are caused by a defect in lysosomal enzymes responsible for the degradation of dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, or keratan sulfate-normal constituents of the connective tissue matrix. These disorders are clinically progressive and are associated with tissue accumulation of glycosaminoglycans. Clinical features vary with the specific enzyme deficiency. Hepatosplenomegaly may develop from the accumulation of incompletely degraded mucopolysaccharides in parenchymal and reticuloendothelial cells. Clinical findings may include facial dysmorphia (rounded broad forehead, small ears, and dished face), corneal opacity, bone and joint lesions (including odontoid hypoplasia, intervertebral disk degeneration, spinal canal and vertebral exostoses, osteoporosis, coxofemoral luxation, lytic areas in long bones and vertebrae, joint effusions, and degenerative joint disease), cardiac murmurs, stunted growth, metachromatic granules in leukocytes, neurologic abnormalities (mental slowness, cervical or thoracolumbar myelopathy), and early death. Mucopolysaccharidosis I (a-L-iuronidase deficiency) has been described in a kindred of Plott hounds and in domestic short-haired cats (Haskins et ai, 1983; Shull et ai, 1984) . Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (arylsulfatase B deficiency) has been described in Siamese and domestic short-haired cats (Breton et al, 1983; Haskins et ai, 1980 Haskins et ai, , 1981 . Mucopolysaccharidosis VII has been described in a dog (Haskins et al, 1984) . A presumptive diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis can be made by a positive urine toluidine blue spot test. Definitive diagnosis is made by measurement of the activity of specific enzymes in fresh serum, cultured dermal fibroblasts, or leukocytes. Treatment with bone marrow transplantation has been reported to result in clinical improvement (Dial et al, 1985; .",

            "text": "Diagnosis of copper-associated hepatopathy in Bedlington terriers can be made by examination of hepatic tissue for excessive copper storage or by performing genetic tests on DNA samples collected from suspected dogs. An autosomal recessive mode of inheritance is in- valved in copper-associated hepatopathy in Bedlington terriers. The frequency of the recessive gene in Bedlington terriers is estimated to be as high as 50% in the United States, with a similar frequency in England. This means that more than 25% of Bedlington terriers are \"affected,\" and another 50% are \"carriers.\" The DNA samples can be collected with a soft cheek brush that is provided by a commercial genetic laboratory (VetGen, 3728 Plaza Drive, Suite 1, Ann Arbor, MI 48108; 1-734-669-8440, Toll Free: 1-800-4-VETGEN, Fax: 1-734-669-8441; or see their web site: www.vetgen.com). By gently brushing the inside of the dog's cheek, cells containing DNA are removed. The collected DNA samples then are analyzed to determine the genetic status of the suspect dog. Useful for dogs of any age, the DNA sample collection and analysis activities can be completed before puppies are purchased at 6 to 10 weeks. The results of the DNA testing also can be formally registered with the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals. (For further information about the Orthopedic Foundation for Animal's Registry for Copper Toxicosis in Bedlington Terriers, contact Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, 2300 E. Nifong Boulevard, Columbia, MO 65201-3856 or telephone 1-573-442-0418.) n-penicillamine, a copper chelator, is recommended for the treatment of the copper-associated hepatopathy in Bedlington terriers as soon as the disorder is confirmed. The recommended dose of n-penicillamine is 125 to 250 mg/day (adult dogs), given 30 minutes before feeding (Hardy, 1983) . The most common adverse effects from o-penicillamine administration are vomiting and anorexia. Vomiting may be manageable by dividing the daily dose into two or three doses. If o-penicillamine is not tolerated, another copper chelator, 2,3,2-trientine, administered at 10 to 15 mg/kg orally one to two times daily or zinc acetate administered at 50 to 200 mg orally once a day, decreases intestinal absorption of copper and may be used. In addition to the decopper drugs, vitamin C and prednisolone have been recommended. Vitamin C is known to facilitate the excretion of copper in urine, and large doses may reduce the intestinal absorption of copper. Dosages of 500 to 1000 mg/day have been suggested (Hardy, 1983) . Prednisolone at 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg per day is recommended only for those dogs showing evidence of active hepatic necrosis. Limitation of the dietary intake of copper is usually not possible. Most dog foods contain 5 to 10 mg/ kg of copper, which may result in a higher copper intake per kilogram than is appropriate.",

Primary hepatobiliary disease associated with an increased accumulation of hepatic copper, albeit smaller amounts of tissue copper than in Bedlington terriers, has been described in Doberman pinscher, Skye terrier, West Highland white terrier, and American and English cocker spaniel dogs (Crawford et al, 1985;  Thornburg and Rottinghaus, 1985;  Thornburg et al, 1986) . The chronic active hepatitis associated with an increased liver copper content in Doberman pinschers occurs primarily in middle-aged females. Although the youngest dog reported with this disorder was 1.5 years old, it is unknown whether younger dogs are symptomatic. It is suspected that affected dogs could be identified at a younger age on the basis of routine screening serum chemistry profiles revealing increased liver enzyme activity.",

Most puppies and kittens that present with hepatic lipidosis have primary disease in other organ systems or an infectious disease, and therefore it is possible that the hepatic lipidosis was the consequence of acquired nutritional inadequacies. A variety of metabolic disorders can disturb the mobilization of triglycerides from the liver. Whenever intrahepatic lipid synthesis or the hepatocellular uptake of fat exceeds the dispersal of triglycerides from the liver, hepatic lipidosis develops (Fig. 11-7) (Miettinen, 1981; Pulito et aI, 1976) . Severe hepatic lipidosis occurs most commonly in toy-breed puppies, which become hypoglycemic and die after prolonged anorexia or fasting (van Toor et aI, 1991) . Clinically, kittens appear to be more susceptible to hepatic triglyceride accumulation than puppies. Any serious medical problem in the kitten can be associated with excessive hepatic lipid accumulation characterized by cytoplasmic vacuole formation that adversely influences hepatic function. Nutritional management that ensures adequate intake of calories, essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids is the best recommended symptomatic therapy. In addition, nutritional management for the mother during pregnancy can be important in possibly preventing hepatic lipidosis in the newborn.",

Concurrent disorders frequently include inflammatory bowel disease, low-grade lymphocytic pancreatitis, and cholecystitis. Cats with lymphoplasmacytic inflammation tend to have greater magnitudes of increased serum ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT activities than cats with just lymphocytic inflammation. Cats with lymphocytic inflammation may develop a lymphocytosis (total lymphocyte counts greater than 14,000/f..d) without other evidence of malignant lymphoproliferative disease. Similar to cats with suppurative CCHS, abdominal radiographs rarely show important diagnostic information. In most cats with nonsuppurative CCHS, a multifocal hyperechoic pattern is recognized ultrasonographically, which represents peribiliary inflammation and fibrosis. In some cats, ultrasonography may fail to show any abnormalities. Cytologic preparations from liver aspirates may lack evidence of inflammation or may disclose only a few inflammatory cells.

The most common liver fluke in cats in North America is Platynosomum amcinnum. Other species of flukes that may infect cats include Amphimerus pseudofelineus, Opisthorchis tenuicollis, Metorchis albidus, and Metorchis conjuctus. Cats acquire Platynosomum con-cinnum infection by the ingestion of the second intermediate hosts: a land snail (Subulina octona) and a lizard or marine toad. Once ingested, the infective stage of the parasite migrates up the common bile duct into the gallbladder and bile ducts, where in 8 to 12 weeks it matures into the adult fluke. Embryonated eggs are passed in the feces and are the basis for diagnosis. Clinical signs are noted by 7 to 16 weeks after infection and may include inappetence, lethargy, weight loss, hepatomegaly, emaciation, mucoid diarrhea, depression, vomiting, and abdominal tenderness. Many naturally infected cats show no clinical signs. In heavy infections, clinical signs may develop before the fecal shedding of ova, which occurs as early as 8 weeks after infection. Concentration of eggs in feces by sedimentation is the most reliable diagnostic test. Transient increases in the serum AST and ALT activities develop during fluke migration through the liver. The serum ALP activity may remain normal or may increase. Cats with heavy fluke infection may become jaundiced. Persistent fluke infections and bile duct obstruction may result in biliary cirrhosis. Treatment with praziquantel (20 to 40 mglkg daily for at least 3 days) is clinically effective.",

Consequently, inflammatory pancreatic disease, that is, acute pancreatitis or relapsing pancreatitis that more commonly affects older dogs and cats, has been rarely identified in dogs and cats younger than 6 months of age. The likely causes of inflammatory pancreatic disease in the young dog and cat are abdominal trauma and infectious agents. Abdominal trauma may induce pancreatitis in dogs that are traumatized by motor vehicles and in cats that have fallen or jumped from high places (high-rise syndrome) (Drazner, 1986 ). In addition, abdominal surgery may result in acute pancreatitis due to traumatic injury to the pancreas (spearing the pancreas with a surgical instrument) or excessive manipulation of the pancreas.",

Varying degrees of frequent (6 to 10 stools per day), foul-smelling, bulky, greasy, loose stools are de-scribed by the dog owner. Often, coprophagia is noted. Affected dogs commonly eat their stools because of their high fat content and because of a dietary energy deficit. The diarrheic stools contain undigested sugars and fats that are being altered by intestinal bacteria to become osmotically active particles (Drazner, 1983) . The marked increase in osmotically active particles and the subsequent efflux of water into the lumen of the intestinal tract result in the colon's inability to resorb the increased volume, and diarrhea ensues. The volume of unabsorbed intraluminal water produces marked intestinal distention and altered motility, which may be severe enough to cause intestinal and colonic bacterial overgrowth (Drazner, 1983) . Unabsorbed fatty acids may also impair the absorptive capacity of the small intestine by damaging the brush border, blunting the villi, and inhibiting colonic water absorption.",

Efforts to treat these dogs are usually rewarded with a favorable response. The expense of treatment and an unconscientious owner, rather than the ineffectiveness of the treatment regimen itself, are most often the reasons that successful treatment is not accomplished. The most effective dietary management for dogs with congenital pancreatic hypoplasia is a highly digestible, lowfiber, moderate-fat diet supplemented with pancreatic enzymes (Lewis et ai, 1987) . Commercial diets formulated for gastrointestinal disease may be fed. The dog's daily food intake is divided into two or three feedings or is fed free choice. The dietary replacement of pancreatic digestive enzymes is given orally with each meal. Various pancreatic enzyme products are commercially available for this purpose (Sherding, 1979) . Reliable commercial products are available in both powder and tablet form. The usual effective dosage of the powder preparation is 1 to 2 tsp per meal for each 20 kg body weight. The pancreatic enzyme product is mixed with the commercially prepared canned or well-moistened dry dog food and fed without necessarily any preincubation time. \"When diarrhea is in remission and the animal is gaining weight, the pancreatic enzyme product should be titrated to the minimum effective maintenance dose per feeding.",
