            "text": "Grossly, the architecture of the nose resembles a triangular pyramid. Inside, this triangle is split down the middle by a septum; the palate is the floor. The narrow apex is the cribriform plate. The lateral wall has a complex anatomy and a great clinical relevance. Shell-shaped bony projections (inferior, middle and superior turbinates) arise from its surface overlying inferior, middle, and superior meatus respectively. (Fig. 1) The nasolacrimal canal opens into the inferior meatus. The ostia of frontal, maxillary and anterior ethmoid sinuses have their opening in the middle meatus, although the posterior ethmoid cells and sphenoid sinuses drain into the superior meatus. (Fig. 2) The passageways of the nose normally run 10 to 12 em deep, from the tip of the nose to the posterior wall of the nasopharynx; they essentially are horizontal parallels to the plane of the palate in spite of the vertical-oblique orientation of the external nose. It is important to provide the patient with this information if satisfactory results from self-administered topical agents are to be obtained. The individual nasal passages measure 3 to 6 mm in diameter, but the patency is remarkably influenced by various factors, including atmospheric conditions such as temperature and relative humidity, hormonal and emotional status, and medications. In addition, there are periods of increased resistance caused by unilateral engorgement of the mucosa, with reciprocal vasoconstriction on the contralateral side called \"nasal cycles.\" These alternating periods normally vary in time from 20 minutes to 3 hours, so that the total nasal resistance to airflow is constant. The musculature shaping the aperture of the external nares also may affect the airflow by widening and narrowing the external nares. Pinch the tip of the nose lightly to experience how dramatically a flail nasal tip may affect respiration. The limen nasi or internal nasal valve is formed by the union of lateral and alar cartilages. Located between the nasal vestibule and nasal cavity, the narrowest area of the nasal airway, any degenerative, post-traumatic or postsurgical changes of this fine structure may compromise greatly the ability to breathe with the nose. The nasal valve (Fig. 3) can be seen easily in children by gently elevating the tip of the nose with some illumination; however, in adults, larger vestibules covered by vibrissae makes the nasal valve slightly more difficult to visualize.",

The fact that ostia of the maxillary sinuses are located high up in the sinus wall is more than just a curiosity, it is a major reason why humans are prone to sinus disorders. The plausible explanation is that paranasal sinuses are vestigial structures, and the drainage pattern is appropriate for a quadrupedal animal, feeding with the head down. Bychanging to the upright position, the phylogenetic evolution brought many advantages to the human species, but also disadvantages like frequent low back pain and familiar sinus disease. Any significant anatomical aberration of the lateral wall structures (e.g., an enlarged middle turbinate, septal spur, polyps), or inflammatory swelling of the mucosa (in response to an allergen, infectious agent or noxious physical stimuli) will obstruct tiny sinus ostia and create an insurmountable barrier on the way of mucociliary transport.

It is a viral illness usually caused by 1 of 110 serotypes of the rhinoviruses, although other agents like coronavirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus might be implicated. Locally in the upper airway, the pathogens trigger an acute inflammatory reaction with the release of vasoactive mediators and increased parasympathetic stimuli that produce congestion and rhinorrhea. The constitutional symptoms probably are secondary to acute viremia. The spread occurs by droplets and close contacts during colder seasons. Children are more susceptible and more symptomatic. The typical ENT presentation initially consists of a dry, burning, scratchy sensation in the nose and throat lasting about a day followed by a catarrhal phase (profuse, watery rhinorrhea, hyperemic, edematous, covered by a transudate nasal mucosa). The catarrhal phase usually lasts for 2 to 3 days. During the following posteatarrhal phase, before the symptoms start to improve, the secretions actually get thicker, adding to the severity of nasal obstruction. A dry and then progressively more productive cough may be associated with it. This mucopurulent phase lasts at least several days before the secretions clear again.

            "text": "Less common causes of rhinosinusitis disease include 1. Nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia (NARES) is a condition that clinically behaves like a perennial allergic rhinitis with a nasal smear heavily loaded by eosinophils, but either skin testing or RAST results are negative. A nonidentifiable allergen or pathogenetic mechanism other than IgE-mediated sensitivity is probably implicated. Avoidance strategies and conventional anti-immune therapy can not be used in these patients. 2. Vasomotor rhinitis, or perennial nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) without eosinophilia, is an idiopathic nasal hyper-reactivity with exaggerated parasympathetic response to a non-well-identified trigger or to physical stimuli such as mild irritants or a change in environmental temperature, that usually does not affect most people. Although it is important to recognize the existence of NARESand NAR without eosinophilia, these conditions are relatively infrequent and have a questionable relevance in a primary care practice. Exclusion of perennial allergic rhinitis, chronic infection, and other types of rhinitis should be considered before making the diagnosis. NARES respond better to the allergy stabilizing and anti-inflammatory agents than the vasomotor rhinitis, which can be challenging to control.\" 3. Nasal polyps are benign proliferative lesions arising from chronically inflamed mucosa of paranasal sinuses or nasal cavity. They are more frequent in asthmatic individuals and are highly correlated with eosinophilia. Nevertheless, about 75% of people with nasal polyps do not have documented allergies. Polyps appear as smooth, pale, mobile, nontender, often multiple masses. They may cause a significant degree of nasal obstruction often compromising the sense of smell. The majority of patients respond to topical steroids. More severe nasal polyposis is controlled by a combination of medical and surgical therapy, but frequent recurrence of the polyps is a major concern in spite of adequate treatment.... s 4. Gustatory rhinitis is a nasal secretory reaction to exquisitely spicy foods and is a common phenomenon. Food-induced allergic manifestations limited to the nasal symptoms are very rare, however. Although this phenomenon may be encountered in the pediatric population, children usually do outgrow it. 5. Rhinitis medicamentosa is rebound congestion (vasodilatation with interstitial edema and hypersecretion caused by a prolonged use of pharmacological agents). Some authors limit this definition to side effects from topical decongestants only> Indeed, the majority of people using topical decongestants develop rebound congestion just after several days of application. This situation progressively is getting worse because the vasocon-stricting effect of the decongestant shortens, while more prominent rebound congestion develops earlier, driving the patient to use the medication more and more often. Once a patient is counseled about the nature of the problem, the management is successful by switching to a short course of oral decongestants. After a few weeks of topical steroid agents the condition reverts back to normal. Rhinitis caused by sniffed cocaine has the same pathogenesis. In advanced stages, mucosa may present as atrophic or crusty with occasional septal perforations. Some authors extend the definition of rhinitis medicamentosa to the oral decongestants and any other systemic drugs capable of causing nasal congestion as a side effect.\" These include antihypertensive agents such as hydralazine, prazosin, methyldopa, guanethidine, propranolol, nadolol; tranquilizers such as thioridazine, or alprazolam; and oral contraceptives. 6. Fungal sinusitis in the past was limited to the complications of uncontrolled diabetes. This invasive disease is caused by the mucor species. With the increased number of immunocompromised patients, invasive aspergillosis became more frequent. Clinically, these conditions may present with necrosis of the nasal structures involving palate and cribriform plate, and systemic symptoms usually are present. Treatment includes surgical debridement, parenteral antifungal medications, and control of the underlying conditions. A local fungal infection limited to a one-sinus cavity also may occur. It presents as mycetoma (fungal ball) and is caused by aspergillus and candida species. Unfortunately, it does not respond well to medical treatment and therefore requires surgical excision and establishment of drainage.\" 7. Allergic fungal sinusitis is a recently recognized entity. Again it is secondary to aspergillus infection. Patients typically present with history of a chronic nasal obstruction and demonstrate hypertrophic polypoid nasal mucosa. Local histology and skin testing usually confirm both fungal and allergic components. 8 . Several systemic conditions known to have implications in nasal obstruction include cystic fibrosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, immotile cilia syndrome, and the aspirin triad (aspirin intolerance, asthma, and nasal polyps). Therefore, recalcitrant rhinosinus disease that is unresponsive to medical management deserves further investigation. 9. Rhinitis of pregnancy is recognized as a separate entity. The nasal congestion is the result of increased estrogen production; however, on careful questioning, the majority of women had symptoms preceding the pregnancy. What they are experiencing is caused by the common causes of rhinitis.\" 10. Hypothyroidism-related rhinitis is mentioned in the literature, but its incidence and clinical relevance is not clear. 11. Atrophic rhinitis or ozena is a diffuse atrophy of nasal mucosa, secondary to chronic mucopurulent or crusty rhinopathy with characteristically foul odor. This condition rarely is encountered in the western world today. The cause of atrophic rhinitis is probably multifactorial, including nutritional and endocrine factors; Klebsiella ozaellae overgrowth also has been implicated. Some success with ciprofloxacin has been documented in addition to aggressive hygienic measures.\" 12. Other conditions that can mimic rhinitis include:",

A rhinoscopic exam helps to further investigate signs of obstruction. A light source (preferably headlight) with or without magnification, nasal speculum, or halogen otoscope with a large ear speculum can be used. Keeping eyes and mind open assists in detecting interesting findings. The first landmark to be identified by anterior rhinoscopy is the nasal valve (see Fig. 3 ), where the vestibular cutaneous and the mucosal lining merge, shaping the narrowest point of the nasal cavity. The inferior turbinate, middle turbinate, anterior aspect of the middle meatus (Fig. 6 ), septal integrity, and degree of septal deviation should be visualized next, followed by the assessment of patency of the nasal passages, degree of hypertrophy, deformity, or asymmetry of the structures. Attention should be paid to the color and thickness of the mucosal lining, septal integrity, and deviation. The origin of the nasal discharge should be searched for and its quantity, quality (watery, exudative, frankly purulent, crusty), and smell should be evaluated. The differentiation between middle turbinate and polyps sometimes might be difficult. The middle turbinate may appear with pseudopolypoid hypertrophic lining of the mucosa, but it is a single structure of firm consistency, relatively immobile, and sensitive to touch. The color of the middle turbinate also is more like the rest of the nasal mucosa and not as ashy and transparent as a polyp. Acute inflammatory changes commonly seen by anterior rhinoscopy are hyperemia and edema of the nasal mucosa covered by exudate. In response to allergens, characteristic signs include pale, bluish, bulging, watery mucosa. Visualization of purulent discharge draining down the middle meatus and facial tenderness on palpation over one or more sinuses with or without facial and periorbital edema is very suggestive of a sinus involvement. By applying a Q-tip, the patency of the nasal passage down to the nasopharynx (notice: not \"up\" to the nasopharynx) can be assessed, and suspicious structures, which may be a turbinate, a polyp, thick mucus, or any other sort of growth can be checked. This method can provide immediate, magic relief by gently squeezing against the edematous turbinates with a Q-tip soaked in decongestant. A gross functional assessment can be obtained by \u2022 Asking the patient to breathe in and out separately with each side of the nose. \u2022 Watching for mist formation while the patient breathes over some polished surface. \u2022 Listening with the stethoscope for nasal airflow. \u2022 Watching the patient blow his or her nose, checking for the effort, appearance and smell of the discharge.

It is imperative therefore to recognize the cause of nasal obstruction, to give a thorough trial of medical therapy, and to allow enough time for medications such as topical steroids to become effective. In case of treatment failure, the physician should reevaluate the findings preferably with endoscopy and imaging techniques in an attempt to determine whether there are surgically correctable defects before scheduling surgery.",

The creation of surgically enlarged passages leads to an excessive loss of resistance to the airflow, compromises the ability of air exchange, and does not improve subjectively the nasal breathing. The preservation of the turbinates also is essential to the humidification and conditioning of the inhaled air. In patients with allergic diathesis the surgical outcomes are not satisfactory, or offer only temporary relief at best. Therefore, allergy investigations should precede surgical procedure. There is no doubt that in properly selected patients, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) can be an important problem-solving procedure. Ideally, referral should be given to patients with chronic, frequently recurrent or complicated rhinosinusitis, who fail the maximal medical management, and in whom a surgically correctable obstruction of the osteomeatal unit or other anatomic defect has been diagnosed.",
