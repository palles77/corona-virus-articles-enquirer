An important clue comes from a natural history study of the world's fastest land animal, the Mrican cheetah ( Fig. 1 ). Difficulty in breeding cheetahs in zoos prompted a multidisciplinary study that showed cheetahs as a species to be remarkably inbred, having a reduction of 90 to 99 per cent of overall genomic diversity based on molecular genetic markers\u2022. Perhaps most surprising was the demonstration that unrelated cheetahs would accept reciprocal skin grafts indicating immunological identity at the cheetah's MHC. The cheetah's genes were likely homogenized by a near extinction event followed by inbreeding in the species' ancestry. When cheetahs became exposed recently to feline infectious peritonitis virus, a coronavirus with low morbidity and mortality in domestic cats (about 1 per cent affected), 100 per cent of infected cheetahs developed symptoms (diarrhea, jaundice, depression, fever) and 60 per cent died 7 \u2022 The cheetah's homogeneous sensitivity to this agent in the face of genetic monomorphism at the MHC provided a rationale for the critical importance of MHC genetic variation in natural populations.

But only about 20 per cent of the Lake Casitas mice became infected even though the virus caused 90 per cent mortality when inoculated into laboratory mouse strains. The reason that 80 per cent of the Lake Casitas mice were virus-free was the presence of a powerful trans-dominant restriction gene, Fv-4, that blocked infection of the retrovirus. Fv-4 was subsequently shown to be a truncated version of the exogenous retrovirus. Integrated into chromosome 12 of resistant mice was a portion of retroviral pol, a full length env and 3'-LTR retroviral genes. In lymphoid cells of protected mice the env portion produced an Env glycoprotein that bound and blocked the murine retroviral receptor, thereby conferring resistance to infection. The LC mice had acqu red a natural evolutionary solutio 1 to a fatal paralytic retroviral disea e. In the presence of the retroviral pathogen, the Fv-4 gene protected its carriers and their offspring, representing a remarkably effective genomic adaptation. Chromosomally integrated endogenous retroviral genomes have been described in many mammal species including humans, and we have always suspected that they represent 'genomic fossils' of historic pathogenic outbreaks\"\u00b7 12 \u2022 At least 0.1 per cent of the human genome is related to retroviral genomes. It is likely that all of these were acquired by infection into the germ line of a developing embryo during an outbreak that conferred endogenous immunity to the carriers. The wild Lake Casitas mouse population and functional retroviral integrations seen in other species are now considered to be the paradigm for acquisition of endogenous retroviral sequences. Expression of endogenous retroviral genes in humans is rare 12 \u2022 Any role they may play in disease resistance is only speculative until an interaction with pathogenic human",

A hint of an answer can be obtained by considering immunodeficiency viruses in free-ranging species. HIV-1, the aetiologic agent for AIDS, causes a slow drop in CD4-bearing Tlymphocytes and has led to collapse of the immune system, opportunistic infections and death in over 2 million people. The cosmopolitan HIV-1 and the less virulent west African HIV-2 strain erupted in human populations within the past few hundred years 13 \u2022 HIV origins are likely to have derived from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a virus that is endemic in free-ranging sooty managabey, green monkey and other Cercopithecus African monkey species.",

FIV was discovered in an immunocompromised domestic cat and, like HIV, induces immune deficiency and death among domestic cats\". FIV has been found in sixteen non-domestic cat species (including puma, leopards, lions, and cheetahs) sampled for antibody and genomic sequences\u2022\u2022\u00b7\". However, the FIV in wild cats, like the African monkeys, shows little evidence for immune suppression, associated disease or mortality. Since viral genomic sequences are highly divergent within and between different cat species, we suspect that the virus is relatively old, perhaps coexisting with wild cat species for thousands of years. Because retroviral sequence evolution is even less clocklike (in a molecular evolutionary sense) than gene sequences of host species, it is difficult to be precise about the timing. Nevertheless, the pattern of FIV divergence is generally monophyletic within each species (as if virus in each species entered that species 744 \u00b7NEWS & VIEWS only once and subsequently evolved), supporting the notion that FIV persistence in the felids is rather ancient. Like the monkeys, the cat species may have achieved an evolutionary balance whereby disease is postponed at least until after the reproductive years. Domestic cats, which do become ill, may simply represent a recent emergence of FIV in a heretofore naive species.",

Is there an adaptive advantage to carrying the virus once historic adaptation has muted its pathogenesis? The answer could involve a temporary acquisition of immune protection against pathogenic FIV which may be present in low frequency or be produced spontaneously by rapid leotiviral mutation. Wild cats infected by an attenuated FIV strain would be immunized naturally against exposure to a virulent strain. An extended period of exogenous virus/host commensalism or symbiosis may provide the time period required for a genomic 'endogenization' event to occur. Although primates and cats have abundant endogenous retroviral sequences, none of these are lentivirus-related. With passenger lentiviruses so common among mammals, it may be simply a matter of time before the birth of endogenous lentivirus sequences in the free-living species. Finally, with the recent development of high resolution comparative gene maps of primate, cat, and other mammalian species, the genetic basis of lentivirus resistance can now be approached'\".",

The burgeoning biotechnology industry was born to accomplish this hope. Harold Varmus, Director of NIH, has moved to review gene therapy research and development as a high priority for medical research. In 1988, David Baltimore of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology coined the term 'intracellular immunization' to describe the delivery of virus-restricting genes to cells of sensitive or infected patients as a genetic therapy to virus disease 19 \u2022 Attempts to apply this to AIDS are beginning, but to be honest we really do not know which genes to use. The answer may be lurking in wild monkeys, cats, gazelles, woodchucks or armadillos.

There is little question that timetested and selectively improved natural solutions to our own medical ills await discovery, and with the rapid advances in medical biotechnology the tools to recognize them are now available. The potential benefits of chemical and genomic prospecting are dazzling, because they promise both to reveal naturally tested solutions for difficult health conditions and to contribute to conservation of the earth's biodiversity.",
