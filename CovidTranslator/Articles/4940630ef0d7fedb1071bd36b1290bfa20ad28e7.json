Methods: Only cases meeting the case definition were included in the study. We reviewed the medical records of the cases who were admitted to the local hospitals, interviewed cases by a standard questionnaire, and then described the epidemiologic features and analyzed risk factors by means of a case-control study. We collected pharyngeal swab specimens and sent them to different laboratories for isolation and culture. The laboratory used different detection methods such as DIF, PCR, electron microscope examination and microneutralization assay, to identify and then type the positive specimens. Results:A total of 871 cases were reported during the period from April 18 to July 4, 2004. The distribution of onset times presented two peaks, one in late May and another in middle June. The epidemic occurred mainly in the elementary and junior high schools in ten townships of one county, and the mean age of the cases was 12 years (range 7 months to 18 years). The course of the disease was acute, and was characterized by fever accompanied with sore throat and tonsillitis. The WBC count of cases was normal or elevated. The mean duration of illness was 5 days (range 2 to 12 days). No fatalities from illness were reported. A case-control study indicated that the possible risk factors were close contact with a case and/or poultry before onset and sharing of towels among members of the family. The typical CPE was observed through inoculating pharyngeal swab specimens into the HEP-2 cell cultures in different laboratories. An infection of adenovirus type 3 was verified by detecting positive specimens in different methods. Conclusion:This investigation demonstrated that the acute respiratory infection in cases was caused by adenovirus type 3. Cases occurred in over 70 schools in ten townships in 2004, and the route of transmission was possibly close contact with cases or droplet transmission.",

Adenovirus can cause coryza and pharyngitis in infants, upper respiratory, pharyngoconjunctival fever, diarrhea and haemorrhagic cystitis in children, acute respiratory disease and pneumonia in young adults, and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis in adults. Adenovirus is a non-enveloped icosahedral DNA virus. Over 100 serotypes have been discovered since the first successful adenovirus isolation in the 1950 s. At least fifty-one serotypes belong to the human adenovirus group and can be divided into six different subgroups (A-F).",

Adenovirus infection can be seen in people, poultry, cattle, dog, rats, pigs and monkeys and be classified as Mastadenovirus and Aviadenovirus. Aviadenovirus or fowl adenovirus(FAV) was once thought impossible to infect mammals including hu-man beings for the reason of strict host specificity [17] . The results of the case-control study identified contact with poultry as one of the risk factors even after the effect of contact with cases was removed.(OR Adjust = 5.4381, 95% CI:1.5297-21.9120). However, we did not detect out viral DNA from 57 animal specimens and five flies specimens using the fluorescence quantitation PCR assay. The lack of identifying virus in the poultry specimens could have been due to an insufficient number of poultry in our sample. Also possibly, an outbreak had occurred in the poultry population but was over by the time when investigators began testing poultry. If infection in humans did result from close proximity to poultry farms, this has implications for avian influenza transmission as well. Determining what specific kinds of contact with poultry put humans at greatest risk for such infections is very important for prevention.",

In China from 1962 to 1988, the dominant genome types were Ad3a2, with occasional isolates of Ad3a4, Ad3a5, and Ad3a6 [18] . The viral etiology study of an acute conjunctivitis outbreak that happened in Shenzhen Areas in the summer of 1997 was performed by He Yaqing, et al [19] and also demonstrated that the main viral strain was Ad3a2. In many outbreaks, the adenovirus viral strain can not be isolated and the genome type can not be identified [20] . Genome types may be useful for epidemiological studies. It is important to identify the variability in epidemic viral strains on time and relate specific strains with clinical manifestation and severity. Analysis of genome types may be of clinical as well as epidemiological importance. Future studies of adenovirus in poultry should examine if unique or similar strains circulate in that population.",

Before the confirmation of pathogen through viral culture, PCR detection of relating viral DNA and serology methods, it was very difficult to distinguish adenoviral diseases from a bacterial diseases based on clinical manifestation, white blood cell count, and chest X-ray findings. Although normal WBC count or leucopenia may be seen after a viral infection, the WBC count may be normal or may be elevated leukocytosis consisting mainly of neutrophils in the adenovirus infection. Progression of the clinical course despite antibiotic therapy and presence of a normal or elevated WBC count suggests the possibility of adenovirus infection [23] .",
