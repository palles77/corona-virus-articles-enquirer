            "text": "Rhinovirus is a ubiquitous RNA virus known to cause the 'common cold.' Infections occur throughout the year and are generally transmitted by aerosols or direct contact. Rhinovirus preferentially infects the upper airways and typically does not cause specific pathological changes. In symptomatic patients, the most common clinical manifestations include rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, sneezing, sore throat, headache, malaise and fevers. Diagnosis of rhinovirus infectious disease is usually made on clinical grounds; however, viral culture, Ag detection, PCR and serology may be used for diagnosis. 1 Treatment of rhinovirus infectious disease is mainly supportive due to the lack of agents targeting this virus. 2 Viral respiratory infections in hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) recipients are a frequently encountered problem. Several studies have shown that rhinovirus can account for 25-40% of cases. 3, 4 Although rhinovirus is known to cause mild upper respiratory tract infectious disease in immunocompetent hosts, it has been linked to fatal respiratory failure in immunosuppressed patients. 5, 6 These reports are limited, however, and the exact role or pathogenesis of rhinovirus in lower respiratory tract infectious disease has not been fully elucidated. In addition, around 13% of HSCT patients with rhinovirus infection may be completely asymptomatic and prolonged shedding of the virus in respiratory secretions is common. 2 Because of these concerns, some medical centers might postpone the HSCT procedure and implement infection control measures in infected patients. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact and clinical features of rhinovirus on this special patient population.",

Patients under 18 years of age, prisoners and those who did not have documented follow-up after transplant were excluded from the study. All cases were followed for 100 days after rhinovirus diagnosis or 100 days after transplant, whichever was later. In each of the controls, the time of follow-up was determined according to the time of rhinovirus diagnosis in the corresponding case. 1 The following data were collected after reviewing the patients' medical records: age, gender, ethnicity, underlying malignancy, type of HSCT, medical comorbidities, conditioning regimen, immunosuppression and anti-infective prophylaxis at the time of rhinovirus diagnosis, laboratory findings at the time of rhinovirus diagnosis ( \u00b1 7 days), other infections after rhinovirus diagnosis, CMV and EBV infection or disease after transplant, in addition to outcomes at the end of the follow-up period including mortality, hospitalizations and GVHD. For the cases, clinical features of rhinovirus infectious disease, timing of diagnosis and radiographic findings were also evaluated. GVHD was diagnosed clinically and confirmed histologically whenever possible by the HSCT team and graded according to the consensus criteria. 7 Recurrent hospitalizations were defined as hospitalizations for any reason after rhinovirus diagnosis in the follow-up period.",

We did not see any difference in terms of mortality, ICU care, or other associated infections. The significant difference was mostly observed in the number of recurrent hospitalizations with rhinovirus cases admitted to the hospital more frequently after the rhinovirus diagnosis. This was true whether the readmission was for all cause hospitalization or due to a specific infectious event. Whether the rhinovirus itself increases susceptibility to infections, especially of the respiratory tract and thus admission rates, is difficult to determine. The other possible explanation of this finding is that HSCT patients with rhinovirus have more symptoms than non-infected controls and are therefore admitted more frequently. There are several limitations to our study. It was retrospective and conducted at a single facility with a relatively small number of subjects. In addition, the PCR assay used may not always reliably distinguish between other picornaviruses (such as enteroviruses) and rhinoviruses. This means that it is at least possible that some of the cases included in the study as rhinovirus infections were actually secondary to enteroviruses or other closely related viruses. Given the ubiquity of rhinoviruses and their being the most common respiratory virus worldwide, it is safe to assume that the vast majority, if not all of our cases, were true rhinovirus infections.",

When comparing these patients to matched controls, there was no significant difference in mortality, ICU care or recurrent hospitalizations (P \u00bc 0.26, 0.36 and 0.35, respectively).

            "text": "In conclusion, this study demonstrates that HSCT patients with rhinovirus infectious disease do not have worse outcomes compared with matched controls. Larger prospective studies are needed to study the impact of rhinovirus infection and disease on this unique population, including specific determination of rhinovirus subtypes associated with severe disease, the incidence and effects of prolonged shedding, or association with other lower respiratory tract infections. Until then, in line with current recommendations regarding the prevention of these infections, 2 continued infection control measures in HSCT patients with suspected respiratory viral infections should continue both in and out of the hospital setting.",
