MBL selectively binds distinct chemical patterns, including carbohydrates expressed on all kinds of pathogens. The present study shows that serum MBL levels influence the ability of chickens to clear the respiratory tract of virus genomes after an infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection. The primary IBV infection induced changes in circulating T-cell populations and in the specific antibody responses. Serum MBL levels also influenced IBV vaccine-induced changes in circulating T-cell populations. Moreover, addition of mannose to an IBV vaccine altered both vaccine-induced changes in circulating T-cell populations and IBV specific vaccine and infection-induced antibody responses in chickens with high serum MBL levels. These data demonstrate that MBL is involved in the regulation of the adaptive immune response to IBV.",

The innate immune system reacts promptly to invading pathogens and instructs antigen presenting cells (APCs) to activate and secrete cytokines that, among other things, regulate T-and B cells towards an appropriate adaptive effector phenotype. Activation of APCs in response to pathogenic stimuli is mediated by unique pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules which participate in the activation of the adaptive immune response [1] [2] [3] . Several soluble PRRs have been characterized as LPS-binding proteins, collectins, pentraxins and alternative pathway complement components in addition to cell-associated receptors like C-type lectins, scavenger receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and various intracellular receptors. Many PRRs are highly conserved and provide the cornerstones upon which the antimicrobial immune response is built. Moreover, vaccine-induced protective immunity can be regulated by PRR stimulation by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) in order to perform the \"adjuvant effect\" which is central to successful vaccinations.",

MBL binds to mannose and other sugar residues present on the cell wall of bacteria, viruses and parasites with high affinity [4] . As these sugars do not naturally occur in higher organisms, MBL represents an important mechanism for discrimination between pathogens and host. MBL exhibits a number of innate immunological properties. By binding to, e.g. microbial cell wall antigens, MBL can act as an opsonin and mediate phagocytosis directly through MBL receptors expressed on the surface of neutrophils and monocytes [5] [6] [7] . Alternatively, MBL can activate the complement system through the 'lectin pathway' causing pathogen lysis or phagocytosis via complement receptors on phagocytic cells. In addition, MBL is important for the removal of circulating immune complexes. Knowledge of the functional role of MBL in the immunity of both humans and animals is increasing [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Individuals with MBL deficiency are reported more susceptible to viral and bacterial infections as well as 0264-410X/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We have also shown that low MBL concentration is associated with increased numbers of Pasteurella multocida in the spleen in a non-selected exotic breed after an infection [21] .

Recently, this was also shown in mouse models where the specific IgG response was increased in MBL-deficient mice following immunization with a Group B streptococcus vaccine [23] and in double MBL knockout mice injected with soluble hepatitis B surface antigen [24] . These results suggest that MBL influences the production of specific antibodies either by directing the immune response into a more cellular response (Th1 vs. Th2) by neutralizing the microorganism via the complement membrane-attack complex, and/or by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines via interaction with other surface receptors [13] . The latter has been shown in a human whole-blood model where a low concentration of MBL enhances the cytokine production and a high concentration suppresses the cytokine production [25] .",

This may lead to the discovery of new adjuvants for the vaccine industry. In the future, this will be an important issue as breeding companies currently focus on selection markers that belong to the innate part of the immune system in their effort to produce more robust animals [26] . Improvement of genetically determined disease resistance is an attractive and inexpensive approach to improve the health status of our production animals. Therefore, the challenge in future vaccination strategies is to choose the optimal adjuvant design for innate robust animals. Thus, when vaccinating it may be necessary to temporarily overcome the contribution from the innate part of the immune system in order to allow the development of the adaptive immune response.",

Recently, new field strains of IBV have been isolated in domestic poultry in China (QX) and Europe (QX-like IBV) causing severe losses to both the layer and the broiler industry [29] because vaccination is no longer fully protective against these new strains. With hindsight, one of these strains may have been a better choice as challenge virus since both groups of animals were protected against infection with the M41 strain. In order to detect any effect of MBL and mannose in relation to vaccine-induced protection against IBV, a more virulent strain should therefore be used in further experiments.",

In the present study, this response was most pronounced in group 1 which was only challenge-infected. The acute phase response was much weaker after the challenge infection in the two vaccinated groups (groups 2 and 3) probably due to the adaptive memory response. No influence of mannose addition to the vaccine was observed for serum MBL levels. The decrease in serum MBL after the vaccination or the infection to below the baseline level may be due to a feedback mechanism from other parts of the immune system. This feedback mechanism may have occurred at the MBL transcriptional level, or alternatively by transfer of MBL from the blood to infected tissues thereby lowering the concentration of MBL in the blood as proposed by Valdimarsson et al. [30] or simply because MBL has been used for opsonization and thus has been engulfed by phagocytic cells. The decrease was then followed by an increase to above baseline level in all three groups which we have no explanation for. Age can be left out as an explanation at least after the vaccination since there was no increase in the mock-vaccinated group.",

In this study, we found no difference between the specific antibody titers in Hand L-chickens in group 1 after infection. This difference may be attributed to the time point chosen for termination of the experiment, i.e. too early, or the titer of the virus (it was calculated to 10 6.5 ELD), i.e. too high, On the other hand, we did find differences between the two sub-lines in group 3, which received mannose together with the vaccine, both PV and PI (Fig. 3) . H-chickens receiving mannose in combination with the vaccine showed very low specific IBV IgG antibody titers compared to L-chickens in the same treatment group, whereas the titers of L-and H-chickens were very similar in group 2 that did not receive mannose. This indicates that high serum levels of MBL influence the production of specific antibodies and that addition of mannose to such high birds MBL with high MBL-levels alters their antibody production in a negative way. Likewise, one may likewise speculate that in birds with constant low levels of serum MBL compensatory mechanisms for induction and regulation of antibody responses are activated and therefore mannose addition does not affect antibody production in L-chicken. The direct involvement of other mannose specific receptors can be ruled out since no difference was found in the L-chickens from groups 2 and 3 presuming that these receptors are genetically identical in the two sub-lines.",

DC-SIGN is known to bind to different pathogens and triggers intracellular signaling cascades that affect TLR signaling and thereby adaptive immune responses (reviewed in [32] ). The specific modulation of the immune responses is dependent on the pathogen involved and can lead to the inhibition or promotion of T helper type 1 (Th1) polarization, Th2 responses and/or induction of regulatory T cell differentiation [33] . In chickens it has been shown that the S protein of IBV alone is sufficient to induce protection [34] .",

The CD4+ cells are considered \"classical\" T-helper cells, whereas the majority of the CD8+ dim positive cells also carry the CD4 molecule on the cell surface and hence are double CD4CD8 positive \u2423\u2424 TCR T-cells expressing the CD8\u2423\u2423 homodimer.

However, the function of chicken \u2425\u2426 T-cells is still largely unknown, but in vitro studies have shown that they can have cytotoxic and immuno-regulatory properties. Moreover, it is not known if chicken \u2425\u2426 T-cells recognize classical peptide MHC antigens or bind to alternative antigens. In mammals, the function of \u2425\u2426 T-cells is likewise not firmly identified; studies in humans [41] and cattle [42] have for instance revealed the existence of several subpopulations of \u2425\u2426 T-cells, that recognize both MHC and non-MHC-associated antigens. These studies have suggested a number of functions such as killer cells, classical T cells with central memory, immunemodulators through cytokine production and as antigen presenting cells.",

This increase in CD4\u2212CD8\u2212 cells was most pronounced in those H-chicken where mannose was added to the vaccine (group 3). Interestingly, it has recently been shown in humans that \u2425\u2426 T-cells can proliferate, express memory markers, and produce cytokines in response to infection with Candida albicans which contains mannose structures [41] . Our results (Figs. 3 and 4b) indicate a role of CD4\u2212CD8\u2212 \u2425\u2426 T-cells in the defense against IBV especially in chickens with low levels of specific antibodies to the virus, e.g. as killer cells. An alternative explanation is that the CD8\u2423+ high \u2423\u2424 T-cells, i.e. CTL's, in these chickens have been translocated from the circulation to the respiratory organs, because it has been shown by adoptive transfer that \u2423\u2424 T-cells bearing CD8 molecules are critical in protecting chickens from IBV infections [36] . This could, however, be addressed by absolute rather that relative counting the different T-cell subtypes in the blood which will be obvious to do in the next experiment.",

            "text": "In conclusion, MBL seems to be associated with clearance of IBV as previously indicated [19] . The acute MBL response peaked 2-3 days PV or PI followed by a down regulation which was most pronounced in H-chickens. The specific antibody titer was highest in L-chickens and mannose seems to inhibite the production of specific antibodies, but only in the H-chickens. The H-chickens, on the other hand, showed decreases in CD4\u2212CD8\u2423+ cells and increases in CD4\u2212CD8\u2423\u2212 \u2425\u2426 T-cells after vaccination and infection which suggested that antibodies and T-cells have complementary functions in the protection against IBV. These results indicate that MBL is involved in the regulation of the adaptive immune response to IBV. MBL should therefore be considered when designing future vaccines in relation to inhibition or promotion of T-helper type 1 (Th1) polarization, Th2 responses and/or induction of \u2425\u2426 T-cells. More research is needed to elucidate the importance of MBL including studies with other MBL ligands.",
