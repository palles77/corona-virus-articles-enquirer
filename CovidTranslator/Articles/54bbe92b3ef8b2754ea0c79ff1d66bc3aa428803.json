However, unlike previous poultry outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza due to H5 that were controlled by depopulation with or without vaccination, the presently circulating A/H5N1 genotype Z virus has since been spreading from Southern China to other parts of the world.",

There are 16 hemagglutinin (H1 to H16) and 9 neuraminidase types (N1 to N9). Hemagglutinin mediates attachment to and entry of the virus into host cells by binding to sialic acid receptors at the cell surface. Hemagglutinin is also the main viral target of protective humoral immunity by neutralizing antibody. The binding affinity of hemagglutinin to the sialic acid residues partly accounts for the host specificity of the various influenza A virus subtypes. Human viruses preferentially bind to sialic acid linked to galactose by \u2423-2,6 linkages that are the main type found on the epithelial cells of the human respiratory tract, while avian viruses tend to bind to \u2423-2,3 linkages that are found on duck intestinal epithelium. 1, 2 The specificity for different receptors has long been one of the explanations for the species barrier between avian and human influenza viruses. The presence of both \u2423-2,3 and \u2423-2,6 linkages in the pig tracheal epithelium is the reason why pigs may serve as the \"mixing vessel\" for the genesis of new viral types through co-infection. 2 Chickens may have a similar role, in that their lung and intestinal epithelia contain both types of linkages. 3 In the human respiratory epithelium, it has been shown that \u2423-2,3 and \u2423-2,6 linkages are found on ciliated and nonciliated cells, respectively, thereby allowing human infection by avian influenza viruses. 4, 5 The change of one amino acid of the H5 protein is sufficient to change the receptor binding specificity of A/H5N1 viruses. 6 Thus, the barrier to interspecies infection can be overcome easily.",

The report of a mutation at position 274 of neuraminidase from histidine to tyrosine in an A/H5N1 isolate from a Vietnamese girl was associated with clinical and laboratory evidence of resistance to oseltamivir but not zanamivir. 36 M2 is an ion channel crucial for the pH-dependent dissociation of matrix proteins from the nucleocapsid during viral uncoating and pH changes across the trans-Golgi network during maturation of hemagglutinin molecules. M2 is the target of the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine). Mutation in the M2 from serine to asparagine at residue 31 invariably confers resistance to adamantanes, and this is seen in the latest A/H5N1 isolates circulating in Southeast Asia since late 2003. 7, 8 PB1-F2 causes cellular apoptosis by acting on the host mitochondria. 9 The hemagglutinin and PB2 proteins appear to be important in determining host specificity and virulence. 10 The other notable feature of influenza A viruses is their propensity to undergo antigenic variations through antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Antigenic drift represents relatively minor alterations in the antigenicity of hemagglutinin or neuraminidase by mutation. This occurs continuously as a result of selection pressure from the host immunity and explains the need for yearly changes in the human influenza vaccine composition. For example, the H3N2 component of the vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere 2005-2006 season is changed to A/California/7/2004(H3N2), as compared to A/Fujian/411/ 2002(H3N2) used in the 2004 -2005 season. Antigenic shift by genetic reassortment of the eight gene segments can result in the appearance of a novel hemagglutinin/neuraminidase combination for which the human population has little or no immunity. The appearance of such novel antigenic types may lead to pandemics of influenza if such strains can be transmitted efficiently from human to human. Major pandemics have occurred in the last century, in 1918 -1919 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), and 1968 (H3N2). However, it is also possible that a pandemic virus is generated by mere mutation of an avian influenza virus such as the A/H5N1, which adapts to the human host without genetic reassortment.",

Human avian influenza infections largely occur as a result of direct transmission of viruses from infected birds to humans. Sporadic cases of human A/H7N7 infections have occurred as a result of direct animalto-human transmission or laboratory accidents; most of these infections resulted in conjunctivitis (Table  1) . 11-13,15-20 Between 1999 and 2003, 3 .8% (7 of 185 poultry workers) in Italy had serologic evidence of infection by H7 avian influenza viruses during an H7N3 epizootic; only 1 worker had conjunctivitis, while the rest were asymptomatic. 14 The first ominous sign that avian influenza viruses could directly infect humans from avian species in a large scale occurred in 1997 in Hong Kong, resulting in 18 documented cases and six fatalities. 15 17 In December 2003, an outbreak of A/H5N1 infection occurred among poultry in South Korea. Shortly afterwards, Vietnam, Japan, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, and Malaysia successively experienced the largest-ever A/H5N1 poultry epidemic in history.

            "text": "The recent epidemic of A/H5N1 virus infection is notable in two ways. Firstly, the geographic extent of the epidemic is unprecedented. Traditionally, southern China is considered to be the epicenter for both human and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses among avian species, domestic mammals, and farm workers have been documented in this region. 23 Since 2004, the A/H5N1 virus has been stretching its borders northwards and westwards, and avian infection has now been described in western China, Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Inner Mongolia, Turkey, and Romania. This puts an increasingly larger human population at risk of infection. Secondly, genetic changes of the contemporary viruses and a changing ecology with different animals are evident. Since 2002, waterfowl in Hong Kong started to succumb to A/H5N1 infections. This is also seen in the current epidemic in Eurasia. Studies 24, 25 of A/H5N1 viruses collected from 2003-2004 in Southeast Asia showed that these viruses infect not only the intestinal tract but also the respiratory tract of ducks, with a higher viral load at the trachea than the cloaca. Viruses may be shed for up to 17 days after infection of the ducks (in contrast to 2 to 5 days in older studies). More importantly, they demonstrated increased virulence to mammals as shown in animal studies 10,26 -29 and natural infection of caged felines in endemic areas. This increase in virulence has been associated with specific amino acid changes in the sequence of the PB2 protein (such as aspartic acid to asparagine at position 701 and glutamic acid to lysine at position 627). 10,29 -31 Disseminated extrapulmonary infection, including the brain, was demonstrated in mice and ferrets. 29 Since 1997, the Z genotype of A/H5N1 viruses has emerged as the predominant virus in southern China and many Z genotype strains also carry M2 gene mutations, thereby conferring resistance to the adamantanes. 7 Other avian influenza viruses have also been associated with symptomatic human infections in recent years (Table 1 ). Human infections due to the A/H9N2 virus manifesting as influenza-like illness was documented in two patients in Hong Kong in 1999. 16 H7N3 infection occurred in two poultry workers in Canada in 2004. 20 The largest outbreak of non-H5N1 avian influenza infection in humans occurred in 2003 in the Netherlands, with 89 virologically confirmed cases and 1 fatal case. 18 Humans acquire avian influenza viruses primarily through direct contact of the mucous membranes with infectious secretions and excreta from infected birds or contaminated poultry products. Personnel involved in culling operations have occasionally been infected. 31, 32 The main portal of entry appears to be the upper respiratory tract and conjunctivae; the latter appears to be an important route for A/H7N7 and A/H7N3 infections. Direct introduction to the lower respiratory tract might occur following massive exposure (such as during a culling exercise), although the importance of this is uncertain. The role of infection through the GI tract remains to be established.",

Adamantanes are active against influenza A viruses, while neuraminidase inhibitors are active against both influenza A and B viruses. Adamantanes are currently not considered to be the drug of choice for avian influenza virus infections because of two reasons. Firstly, adamantane resistance emerges rapidly following therapeutic use in human influenza, and the resistant viruses are fully transmissible and pathogenic. Up to 30% of patients with human influenza A being treated with amantadine may shed resistant viruses, sometimes as early as day 2 to 3 after treatment. 49 Such adamantane-resistant viruses can readily be transmitted to contacts. Secondly, recent isolates of A/H5N1 from the Indochina clade in Cambodia-Thailand-Vietnam often carry mutations in the M2 gene, thereby rendering this group of antiviral agents ineffective in the treatment and prevention of this emerging epidemic. 7 But it is important to note that the China-Indonesia clade are still quite susceptible to amantadine. Thus, adamantanes should still be considered for prophylaxis in the community contacts if the pandemic strain is still susceptible. The long shelf life of amantadine of \u03fe 25 years and its low cost make it an attractive choice for stockpiling.",

[53] [54] [55] [56] The susceptibility of avian influenza viruses to neuraminidase inhibitors is variable and appears to be related to the specific neuraminidase type ( Table 2) . A/H5N1 viruses isolated in 1997 and in the recent outbreaks are readily inhibited by clinically achievable levels of neuraminidase inhibitors. Nevertheless, an oseltamivir-resistant A/H5N1 isolate was recently described in Vietnam. 36 In this report, 36 an oseltamivir-resistant A/H5N1 virus was isolated from a symptomatic girl who had received 4 days of postexposure oseltamivir prophylaxis (75 mg qd). The virus had a histidine-to-tyrosine substitution at position 274 of the neuraminidase protein, and the IC 50 for oseltamivir was found to be 90 nmol/L, still within clinically achievable peak plasma level of oseltamivir. The girl subsequently received a therapeutic dose of oseltamivir (75 mg bid) for 7 days, and no viruses were then isolated. This level of resistance apparently did not lead to treatment failure in this case, although it is impossible to draw definite conclusions based on a single case report. One of the viral clones of the girl's isolate, however, has an IC 50 for oseltamivir of \u03fe 763 nmol/L. Extensive use of oseltamivir for the treatment of human influenza in children has been shown to be associated with a substantial risk of resistance developing to the agent. 57 Therefore, it will hardly be surprising to see more oseltamivir-resistant A/H5N1 viruses when the number of human cases increases and the use of this drug for prophylactic or therapeutic purposes becomes more common. Other strategies for antiviral therapy and prophylaxis are urgently required.",

The latter test method tends to give more variable results and higher IC 50 levels. In vivo susceptibility of influenza viruses to this group of compounds is more closely related to the results NA enzyme inhibition assays. 76 Unless otherwise stated, values for IC 50 are determined by the neuroaminidase enzyme inhibition. EC 50 is determined by cell-culture-based virus reduction or microcentralization assays. optimal dosing of oseltamivir for avian influenza, which most likely requires higher doses than currently recommended dosages for human influenza. Increased dose is especially indicated in patients with a high viral load due to delayed presentation, severe diseases with shock, or poor oral drug absorption as a result of severe diarrhea. Although oseltamivir has been administered in high doses to healthy volunteers at supratherapeutic doses without significant adverse reactions, 77 any potential toxicity associated with high-dose regimens must be closely monitored in therapeutic trials. If the use of an increased dosage of neuraminidase inhibitors for avian influenza infection is indeed beneficial, this will have a major impact on the supply of these agents in a pandemic situation. One option is to use a combination of oseltamivir and probenecid to double the systemic exposure following a conventional dosage of oseltamivir. 78 Another option is to use combination therapy with two neuraminidase inhibitors, one neuraminidase inhibitor plus one adamantane if the circulating genotype is susceptible to adamantanes, or one neuraminidase inhibitor plus ribavirin (or viramidine when it becomes available). The synergistic effects of these combinations, if any, need to be studied urgently by in vitro and animal studies. Ribavirin has been used in the treatment of human influenza A virus infections, usually administered orally or by aerosolization, and occasionally by the IV route for severe infections or in immunocompromised hosts. A consistent benefit has not been observed in clinical studies, and currently ribavirin is not considered to be a drug of choice for influenza A infection. There are only limited in vitro data on the activity of ribavirin on avian influenza viruses. 73 But ribavirin was shown to be highly effective in reducing mortality in a mannan-enhanced mice model infected by influenza B even when treatment was delayed for 3 days after the infection, when oseltamivir treatment is no longer effective. Combination of oseltamivir with ribavirin treatment started at such delayed timing does not increase the efficacy in this mice model. Viramidine is a carboxamidine analog of ribavirin that also demonstrates broad-spectrum antiviral activities like ribavirin. Its anti-influenza activity has been confirmed in limited in vitro and animal studies. 73 Viramidine is currently not licensed for clinical use.",

This mode of delivery for zanamivir could be problematic in certain populations such as the very young and old patients, the intubated patients, and those who are severely ill who are not able to inhale the powder properly. Oseltamivir is easier to administer and theoretically more effective when there is systemic infection or severe pneumonia (with collapse and/or consolidation of the lungs that could hinder penetration of inhaled zanamivir). However, both neuraminidase inhibitors need to be available because crossresistance between the two neuraminidase inhibitors is incomplete. For example, the oseltamivir-resistant A/H5N1 isolate from Vietnam described above remains fully susceptible to zanamavir. A healthy reserve of zanamivir not only relieves the tension over oseltamivir supply but may also prove necessary when oseltamivir-resistant viruses become prevalent in the future. Zanamavir should be considered for prophylaxis in health-care workers taking care of patients receiving treatment with oseltamivir for avian influenza. Zanamivir may be used for prophylaxis or treatment of less severely ill patients because higher blood levels of the drug may not be needed (the blood level of zanamivir is almost 5 times lower than that of oseltamivir). However, oseltamivir may be reserved for patients with systemic infection or severe pneumonia who require higher blood levels. It is unfortunate that other formulations of zanamivir and the newer agent peramivir are not commercially available. In preclinical trials, IV zanamivir, even when administered at doses up to 1,200 mg/d, was very well tolerated and achieves very high blood and respiratory secretion levels; protective efficacy was also demonstrated in experimental human infections. 61, 67 The role of combinations of neuraminidase inhibitors are uncertain, as is the case of combinations with other groups of antivirals. However, a low serum level of inhaled zanamivir in patients with consolidated lungs may theoretically promote the emergence of zanamivir resistant virus that is crossresistant to oseltamivir.",

For patients suspected or confirmed of having avian influenza, the WHO recommended contact and droplet precautions as key measures. 85 Airborne precautions are also recommended because of the high mortality and the ability of human influenza viruses to be transmitted by droplet nuclei. The relative importance of these routes of transmission are uncertain at present. The findings of GI involvement by A/H5N1 viruses and the prominent diarrhea with a high fecal viral load in some patients should be not be overlooked. A similar combination of clinicopathologic findings during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong led to an unprecedented outbreak in a housing estate via airborne transmission of a virus-laden aerosol plume generated from a faulty sewage system. 84 Besides hospital-acquired infections, laboratory-acquired infections during the postmortem examination of A/H7N2-infected seals have been reported. The 1977 A/H1N1 strain was believed to have been originated from a laboratory in Russia. In 2005, an isolate of A/H2N2 virus was erroneously sent to laboratories in 18 countries in a proficiency testing program. Therefore, faulty laboratory precautions can also be a source for pandemics. Avian influenza viruses are readily inactivated by common disinfectants, and the WHO presently recommends the use of 1% sodium hypochlorite or 70% alcohol for disinfection.

Proper poultry-handling practice and personal hygiene (such as handwashing) and minimizing contact with birds are basic precautions that must be enforced. In some instances, use of an H5 vaccine in poultry has been shown to be able to interrupt virus transmission in the field. 89 There are no H5 influenza vaccines licensed for human use at present, but developmental work is ongoing. An inactivated H5N3 vaccine was previously tested in human subjects and was found to be well tolerated. 90 An MF59-adjuvanted vaccine was immunogenic in volunteers with development of anti-A/H5N1 neutralizing antibodies. 91 Another recombinant baculovirus-expressed H5 hemagglutinin vaccine has also been tested in human subjects and was immunogenic. 92 Other candidate vaccines that have appeared to be protective in animal models include an A/H5N1 vaccine generated by reverse genetics. 93 Even though vaccine development is taking place, it is important to remember that the pandemic strain may have significant antigenic differences from the H5N1 vaccines being developed. Should this happen, a new vaccine would have to be developed with a significant time lag of 6 months before an effective vaccine is commercially available for mass vaccination.",

            "text": "In the absence of an effective human vaccine, antiviral chemoprophylaxis remains the only viable means for specific protection against avian influenza. Oseltamivir prophylaxis was used in the Netherlands during the A/H7N7 outbreak for high-risk individuals, such as personnel involved in culling operations on infected farms, and hospital and family contacts of a patient suffering from A/H7N7 pneumonia. Persons who had received oseltamivir prophylaxis appeared to have a lower risk of infection by avian influenza (2.6% vs 9.6% infection rate for those who had and had not received prophylaxis, respectively), although the difference was not statistically significant. 18 Perspective Avian influenza may seem to be the most likely candidate for the next influenza pandemic. Vaccines are probably the most effective means of specific protection, but the ability to produce effective vaccines on time will limit their role in the early phase of the pandemic. Indiscriminate use of neuraminidase inhibitors for human influenza virus infection should be discouraged because this will inevitably promote the emergence of neuraminidase inhibitorresistant influenza viruses. 57 Another potential concern is the reassortment between neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant A/H1N1 or A/H3N2 virus with A/H5N1 virus, resulting in neuraminidase inhibitorresistant A/H5N1 reassortants with enhanced human-to-human transmissibility. Studies need to be done urgently to include the role of combination antiviral therapy in treating severe infections and its ability to prevent the emergence of resistant strains of viruses. The efficacy of other agents such as ribavirin (by aerosolization or systemic administration), either alone or in combinations, should be explored. Antiviral susceptibility testing must be performed on new epidemic strains, as not all A/H5N1 viruses are resistant to adamantanes (our unpublished data, 2001). While oseltamivir is toxic to newborn rats at a dose 250 times higher than the recommended pediatric dosage, the use of oseltamivir in infants \u03fd 1 year old has not been shown to be neurotoxic. This should be confirmed by larger clinical trials. 94, 95 Efforts to avert or minimize the impact of the impending pandemic should not be based solely on therapeutic measures. Simple community infection control and personal hygienic measures are important for respiratory infections, as shown in the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003. 96 Human avian infection is currently limited to close contacts with infected animals. For travelers to endemic areas of avian influenza, avoiding close contacts with poultry or wild birds could significantly reduce the risk of infection.",
