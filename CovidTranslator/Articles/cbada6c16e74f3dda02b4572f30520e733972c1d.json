            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has been responsible for several recent outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) and has caused great economic loss in the swine-raising industry. Considering the significance of PEDV, a systemic analysis was performed to study its codon usage patterns. The relative synonymous codon usage value of each codon revealed that codon usage bias exists and that PEDV tends to use codons that end in T. The mean ENC value of 47.91 indicates that the codon usage bias is low. However, we still wanted to identify the cause of this codon usage bias. A correlation analysis between the codon compositions (A3s, T3s, G3s, C3s, and GC3s), the ENC values, and the nucleotide contents (A%, T%, G%, C%, and GC%) indicated that mutational bias plays role in shaping the PEDV codon usage bias. This was further confirmed by a principal component analysis between the codon compositions and the axis values. Using the Gravy, Aroma, and CAI values, a role of natural selection in the PEDV codon usage pattern was also identified. Neutral analysis indicated that natural selection pressure plays a more important role than mutational bias in codon usage bias. Natural selection also plays an increasingly significant role during PEDV evolution. Additionally, gene function and geographic distribution also influence the codon usage bias to a degree.",

PED is a great threat to swine health and production, and it has caused devastating diseases with a severe impact on the swine-raising industry Lee and Lee, 2014; Puranaveja et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2014) . PED is characterized by vomiting, watery diarrhea and dehydration and causes a high death rate among suckling piglets. PED has been reported in many countries since 1971, including China (Chen et al., 2008; Tian et al., 2013) , Thailand (Puranaveja et al., 2009; Temeeyasen et al., 2014) , South Korea (Lee and Lee, 2014; Park et al., 2013) , and the United States Wang et al., 2014) . Outbreaks of PED were first identified in the United States between 2013 and 2014, and in less than one year, 2692 PED cases were found in 23 US states, which led to great economic losses Wang et al., 2014) . The genome of the causative agent was identified as being closely related to a strain from China . During 2013 and 2014, outbreaks of PED also occurred in South Korea, and genomic sequences of the South Korean isolated virus were shown to be similar to the US PED strains (Lee and Lee, 2014) . The recent frequency in outbreaks and the great economic losses associated with PED indicate the importance of understanding this virus.",

The PEDV genome is composed of seven open reading frames (ORFs) (Egberink et al., 1988; Kocherhans et al., 2001) . ORF1a and ORF1b encode the replicase proteins.

Synonymous codon usage bias is strong in some viruses, such as the hepatitis A virus (D'Andrea et al., 2011) . Other viruses have weak codon usage bias, such as SARS (Zhao et al., 2008) , classical swine fever virus (Tao et al., 2009) , and H9N2 influenza A virus (Liu et al., 2010a) . Codon usage bias is related to mutation bias, natural selection, gene function, gene length, tRNA abundance, and RNA structure. Codon usage bias is generally influenced by one of the two following biological pressures: (1) pressure from mutational bias and/or (2) pressure from natural selection (Fu, 2010) . In some RNA and DNA viruses, mutational bias has been identified as playing a more important role, compared with natural selection, such as in foot-and-mouth virus (Zhou et al., 2010) and herpes virus (Fu, 2010) . Natural selection has also been confirmed as being the dominant factor in some viruses such as Parvoviridae (Shi et al., 2013) . The nucleotide content in the third codon position (A3s, T3s, G3s, C3s, GC3s, AT3s) is based on the codon usage bias (Wong et al., 2010) . Many analytic methods for analyzing codon usage bias have been developed and are based on examining the nucleotide content of the third codon position. These methods have been shown to be effective in uncovering the codon usage bias of the genome and other significant information, such as the effective number of codons (Wright, 1990) .",

Understanding the extent and causes of codon usage bias is essential to research focused on viral evolution and transmission. To date, only a limited number of studies have focused on synonymous codon usage in animal viruses.

            "text": "The results indicate that codon usage bias exists and that the PEDV preferred codons ending in (U)T. The codon usage bias was further confirmed by the mean ENC value of 47.91. For comparison, the mean ENC value for the following other studied viruses is: (1) foot and mouth disease virus (mean ENC = 51.42) (Zhou et al., 2010) , (2) H5N1 influenza A virus (mean ENC = 50.91) (Auewarakul et al., 2009) , (3) duck enteritis virus (mean ENC = 52.17) (Jia et al., 2009 ), (4) SARS (mean ENC = 48.99) (Zhao et al., 2008) , (5) classical swine fever virus (mean ENC = 51.7) (Tao et al., 2009) , and (6) Hepatitis A virus (mean ENC = 39.78) (D'Andrea et al., 2011 ). An ENC value greater than 45 is considered to represent a low codon usage bias. The mean ENC value for PEDV was a little higher than most viruses, and the value is also higher than 45. Accordingly, the codon usage bias of PEDV is comparatively low. A low biased codon usage pattern may allow the virus exploit several codons for each amino acid, and accordingly is beneficial for viral replication in the host cells. Additionally, the existence of the codon usage bias in PEDV was identified in the ENC plotted-GC3s analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 , the data points representing the ENC value for each PEDV strain were lower than the expected curve. When the PEDV codons are completely random with bias present, all of the data points lie upon the expected curve. This reveals that other factors also influence the PEDV codon usage pattern. Mutational bias and natural selection pressures have been shown to be the two main forces involved in shaping the synonymous codon usage pattern of RNA viruses. To examine the possible role of mutational bias in the codon usage pattern, we performed a correlation analysis between the nucleotide content and the codon composition. The strong correlation between these two variables (except in the C% and A3s, G3s, and GC3s) showed that mutational bias contributed to the codon usage pattern. A significant correlation was shown between the ENC values and the nucleotide content (Table 3) , which also reveals the importance of the mutational bias. The role of mutation bias was further demonstrated by the PCA analysis. Using the PCA analysis, we found that the first and second axes values were significantly correlated with the nucleotide content. A weak codon usage bias may be caused by natural selection when the viruses try to adapt to the host cell. Thus, we then investigated the role of natural selection in shaping the PEDV codon usage pattern by the investigating the relationships between the Gravy value, Aroma value and nucleotide content, and the high CAI value compared with the pig genome codon usage pattern. Next, the natural selection pressure was proven as being more important than mutation bias in neutral analysis. In addition, gene function and geographic distribution were also identified as influencing factors in shaping the PEDV codon usage pattern, while the genomic group had no affect on the PEDV codon usage bias. Finally, we identified several factors that contribute to the PEDV codon usage bias.",
