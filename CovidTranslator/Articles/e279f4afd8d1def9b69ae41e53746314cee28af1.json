The trial will compare the \u00d4supervised use of facemasks\u00d5 versus \u00d4standard measures\u00d5 among pilgrims over several Hajj seasons. Cluster-randomisation will be done by accommodation tents with a 1:1 ratio. For the intervention tents, free facemasks will be provided to be worn consistently for 7 days. Data on flu-like symptoms and mask use will be recorded in diaries. Nasal samples will be collected from symptomatic recruits and tested for nucleic acid of respiratory viruses. Data obtained from questionnaires, diaries and laboratory tests will be analysed to examine whether mask use significantly reduces the frequency of laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infection and syndromic RTI as primary outcomes.",

During any inter-pandemic year, there are an estimated 1 billion cases of influenza worldwide with 3-5 million cases of severe illness and 300,000-500,000 deaths [1] . Fear of the global spread of serious respiratory disease persists in the light of past pandemics, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, and the recent emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [2] . Ever-increasing international travel intensifies the risk of the spread of emerging novel viruses, further intensifying the concern [3] . Mass gatherings such as the Hajj pilgrimage pose a particular risk for transmission of respiratory viruses [4, 5] .",

A randomised controlled trial (RCT) in a household setting found that adherence to facemask use decreased the risk of influenza-like illness (ILI) [7] . Meta-analysis of data from 6 trials shows that wearing facemasks is protective against ILI, but did not show that facemasks are protective against laboratory-confirmed influenza, perhaps due to limitations of the studies (Fig. 1 ) [18] . Interestingly, one nested case-control study showed that intermittent facemask use was associated with a significantly greater risk of infection among healthcare workers at Hajj, suggesting perhaps that infectious material that settles on facemasks can become a source of direct hand transmission to the respiratory tract [19] . Standard facemasks may prevent: (i) acquisition of infection by droplet and/or aerosol spread, or conversely, (ii) transmission from infected subjects [20, 21] .",

The largest study undertaken to date was a cluster-randomised trial in 509 households, with 2788 recruits; it did not find an additional benefit from the combination of facemasks and hand hygiene over health education (regarding preventive measures) on the overall rate of laboratoryconfirmed viral infection, although there was a benefit against secondary transmission of RTI and laboratory-confirmed influenza. The authors pointed to concerns about both under-powering of the study and poor compliance with mask use [11] . Bin Reza et al. recommended that sufficient power may be achieved by larger trials that are multi-centred and run for several years [6] . The authors of this study contend, in addition, that taking important steps to improve compliance with mask use is also critical to inducing a form of herd immunity through widespread mask use. There are considerable logistic and cost issues to consider in the design and conduct of such trials, but the public health benefits of a positive result could be substantial.",

Additionally, this study will address the newly emerged MERS-CoV threat and the potential role of facemasks in its prevention.

An efficient orchestration of the trial is needed to achieve the study objectives; this include training a large number of study research volunteers (n = 500), leading the team to conduct the trial, appropriate data collection, and storage and transport of samples in optimum temperature. Additionally, the compliance with facemask use in intervention tents must be optimised. Some ''contamination'' may occur whereby subjects in control tents may use facemasks. These issues would be addressed by analysing data with respect to compliance of facemask use, in addition to intention-to-treat analysis. Study staff will visit the intervention tents twice a day to encourage mask use and advise people if they have problems with wearing facemasks. Study staff will similarly visit the control tents and encourage the recruits to strictly maintain a record of any facemask use, to complete their diary and to collect samples from symptomatic pilgrims. A recent pilot study showed that high compliance could be achieved, up to 76%, where facemask usage was recommended and the purpose explained [28] .",
