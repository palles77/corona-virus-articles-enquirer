The compounds which inhibited more than 50% of the protease activity at 50 lM were selected for the next assay run at 10 lM for IC 50 calculation. Compound 6m with R 2 group of nitro functionality at C-4 position is the most potent inhibitor with an enzyme inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CL pro with an IC 50 of 6.1 lM. The structure and IC 50 values are given in Table 1 . The cytotoxicity of the test compounds was tested by performing the MTT assay and found that all compounds are devoid of cytotoxicity. 24 To obtain molecular insight into the binding properties of these active compounds, we conducted docking studies in the 3CL pro active site. For modeling analysis, the crystal structure of SARS 3CL pro in complex with a peptide inhibitor (PDB code 1UK4) was used. 26 Docking process was performed using an automated ligand-docking subprogram of the Discovery Studio Modeling 1.2 SBD (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA), with a set of parameters chosen to control the precise operation of the genetic algorithm. Docking runs were carried out using standard default settings 'grid resolution' of 5 \u00c5, 'site opening' of 12 \u00c5, and 'binding site' selected for defining the active site cavity. In search of obtaining a model of the associated complex between the compound 6m and protein, the distance between the NH of the pyrimidine ring and oxygen atom of Glu-166 was constrained in the distance of 2.0 \u00c5. The orientation of the ligand has the nitro phenyl group situated in the S1 pocket, with the nitro group pointing towards the surface of the protein. One of the oxygen of the nitro group is in close proximity 2.3 \u00c5 to the Gly-143 and the other oxygen atom is forming hydrogen bond with Cys-145 at the distance of 2.1 \u00c5 (Fig. 2) . The chlorophenyl ring fits into the S2 pocket and having hydrophobic interactions with Met-49 and Gln-189. The results of the docking studies presented here suggest that the nitro phenyl group of 6m can potentially occupy the active site cysteine residue in the enzyme. The oxygen of the nitro group formed a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Gly-143 and Cys-145 that was important for inhibition activity. The compounds lacking nitro functionality in the aryl ring lost the activity. Moderate electron withdrawing substituent R 1 like chloro in the compounds 6l and 6m favors the inhibitory activity when compared to the electron donating groups like methyl and methoxy in the compound (see Table 1 ). This result suggests that the substituent R 1 can be electron withdrawing group to increase the inhibitory action.",

The measured inhibitory activity coupled with possible structure modifications revealed by 3D docking give us new directions for a fast development of much more potent inhibitors. Further investigations on this new family of compounds are currently in progress in our laboratory.",
