These women and their families should be counseled about the schedule of care visits; diagnostic testing for HIV; and chemoprophylaxis with zidovudine (ZDV) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), which are recommended for at-risk infants ( Table 1 ).2 l9 A DNA polymerase chain reaction for the detection of HIV is recommended before hospital discharge. Diagnostic tests for HIV in the infants detects 30% to 50% of infected infants at birth, with more than 95% diagnosed by 2 months of age, so physicians should follow up these infants closely during the first several months of life. Their mothers should be counseled against breast-feeding their infants because of the additional risk for transmission of HIV to 65 At the authors' institution, the first postnatal visit is done at 14 days of life. At this visit, compliance with the ZDV regimen is assessed, dosing is adjusted as needed, and refills given to ensure that infants have a 6-week supply of ZDV. Also, feeding practices and nutrition'are discussed. A complete blood count is recommended to monitor for hematologic toxicity, most commonly, anemia or leukopenia. If the HIV DNA PCR was not done at birth, it is performed at this visit. During the second visit, at 6 weeks of age, ZDV is discontinued if the HIV DNA PCR tests have been negative. At this visit, complete blood count, T-cell subsets, and DNA HIV PCR results are obtained. TMP-SMX is begun at a dose of 150 mg/m2/ dose given three times a week for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis curinii pneumonia (PCP), and the first set of immunizations is given. PCP prophylaxis is started empirically in at-risk infants less than 1 year of age, independent of the CD4+ cell count and percentage, because HIV status may be uncertain and, in infected infants with rapid pronression of disease, CD4+ cell counts can decrease precipitously in thifirsi m k t h s of life, predisposing to PCP.rn, 74 At-risk infants are seen at 4 and 6 months of age for routine care and immunizations and appropriate immune and diagnostic tests. When an at-risk infant has had two negative HIV DNA PCR test results after 2 months of age and is clinically and immunologically normal, PCP prophylaxis is discontinued. These children are considered presumptively HIV negative, but an HIV enzymelinked immunosorbent assay test is performed after 1 year of age to monitor for the disappearance of maternal antibody. If the HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot are negative, the ELISA test is repeated and, if the result is negative, the child is considered uninfected and a seroreverter. Because many infants are born to HIV-infected women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy, physicians should carefully note drug exposure on these infants' charts and maintain follow-up on them as long as possible to determine any long-term effects of prenatal or postnatal exposure to these drugs. Also, any congenital anomalies or unusual illnesses occurring in these infants should be ",

Common clinical manifestations of pediatric HIV infection include generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, oral candidiasis, parotitis, recurrent or persistent diarrhea, failure to thrive, and developmental delay. Multiple organ system involvement is common, and the following HIV-associated conditions have been found: cardiomyopathy, lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis, nephropathy, encephalopathy, enteropathy, hepatitis, and malignancies. Skin manifestations caused by bacterial, viral, and fungal infections; atopic disease; hypersensitivity reactions; and pruritic papular reactions are common. Table 5 outlines the clinical and laboratory studies and assessments that should be done at baseline and thereafter at periodic intervals. These studies are done to identify any am;e problems and to assess the risk for opportunistic infections or other HIV-related complications and monitoring for medication side effects. Studies have shown that prognosis in children is related independently to viral burden and immune ~tatus.5~ Also, a direct relationship exists between the development of certain opportunistic infections and the degree of immune suppression. 18 HIV-infected children should have baseline antibody titers obtained for toxoplasma, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and hepatitis viruses. The results provide information about these children's exposure and susceptibility to specific infections. For example, if a CMV-seronegative child requires a blood transfusion, then a CMVnegative donor blood is requested or, if unavailable, leukofiltered blood is used.",

RHo(D) immune globulin intravenous (WinRho SDF) is an alternative to WIG, but hemolysis may result and is a significant side effect. Corticosteroids are another alternative treatment. Prednisone is usually started at a dose of 2 mg/ kgl d for 2 to 4 weeks and then tapered and discontinued, but the thrombocytopenia may relapse when the steroids have been discontinued. Interferon alfa is reported to be effective in patients with severe thrombocytopenia that is resistant to antiretroviral therapy. Splenectomy is an option to consider if other treatments fail and usually results in the resolution of thrombocytopenia, but the lack of a spleen will predispose these children to encapsulated bacterial infections.55, 6 . 1 If splenectomy is considered, these children should be immunized with pneumococcal, Haemophilus influenzae type B, and meningococcal vaccines. A new approach is the use of recombinant thrombopoietin. Harker et a1% experimentally treated three chimpanzees infected with HIV and thrombocytopenia with pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor. The chimpanzees had a tenfold increase in platelet number, 30-fold increase in marrow megakaryocyte numbers, and fourfold increase in marrow megakaryocyte progenitor cells. On the other hand, Cole et a P found that thrombocytopenia in HN-infected patients was caused by a shortening of platelet life span, increased splenic sequestration, and ineffective delivery of viable platelets and that levels of thrombopoietin were significantly higher than in control subjectsz3 The eventual role of this agent in the treatment of thrombocytopenia in children or adults infected with HIV is unclear.",

Therapy is directed at the usual pathogens (i.e., Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. infuenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus), but in patients with chronic lung disease, gram-negative organisms, especially P. aeruginosa, must be considered potential pathogens. The authors have had good experience with the combination ticarcillin-clavulanic acid.

The Woman Infant Transmission Study prospectively followed up 128 HIV-infected children. Of the 128 children, 27 (21%) were diagnosed with HIV encephalopathy. Encephalopathy was more common with advanced disease (89% of the children were category B or C, and 74% were category 2 or 3). The presence of encephalopathy increased the risk for death 28-fold. The presence of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy in the first 3 months of life and increased viral load was correlated with the presence of encephalopathy. A trend, although, not statistically significant, showed that children with a positive HIV culture in the first week of life were at higher risk for encephalopathy. Levels of HIV RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid may be an important predictor of encephalopathy.

In areas where a high prevalence of measles exists, monovalent measles vaccine is given between 6 and 12 months of age. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, children with HIV who developed measles infection had a high risk for complications and death, suggesting that the benefits of administering this live viral vaccine outweighed the potential risks, but in one case report, a 21-year-old hemophiliac man infected with HIV was immunized with the measles-mumpsrubella vaccine, giant cell pneumonia developed 1 year later, and the patient died.17 The measles vaccine virus was isolated from postmortem specimens. Since this report, recommendations have been altered, and children with mild or moderate immunosuppression (i.e., immune category 1 or 2) should receive the measles vaccine, but children with severe immunosuppression (i.e., immune category 3) should be excluded. Whether a child with severe immunosuppression who responds to HAART with an increase in the CD4+ T-cell count and percentage corresponding to immune category 1 or 2 should be immunized with measles vaccine is a matter of controversy. At this time, the functional capacity of the CD4+ T cells that have been restored is uncertain. Until a reliable, quantitative test is available to define the function of these restored cells, immunization with the measles vaccine is not recommended in these situations. Also, the antibody response to measles vaccination in HIV-infected children may vary in amount and duration, depending on the clinical and immune status of these children, so in the case of exposure to measles, HIV-infected children should receive prophylaxis with immunoglobulin, preferably, within 72 hours after exposure. The dose recommended for children with symptomatic HIV infection is 0.5 mL/kg (maximum dose, 15 mL) and for asymptomatic children is 0.25 mL/ kg, given intramuscularly. Children who have received IVIG therapy within 3 weeks of exposure do not need additional prophylaxis.",

In children with severe immunocompromization, recurrent herpes zoster virus or chronic varicella infection may develop. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices does not recommend administering the varicella vaccine to persons with cellular immune deficiencies, but because of the increased risk for morbidity from varicella and herpes zoster, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that the varicella vaccine be considered for children with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HIV infection, CDC classification N1 or Al, with an age-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage of 25% or more.2O The vaccine should be administered in two doses with a 3-month interval between doses for this group of children. This schedule differs from the vaccination schedule for healthy children. It is strongly recommended for HIV-negative siblings and children living in households with HIVinfected adults or children, but this vaccine should not be administered to children with HIV infection who have moderate or severe immunocompromization. Studies to evaluate the safety and tolerance of this vaccine in HIV-infected children are ongoing. In a studyto determine the safety and immunogenicity of the Oka strain varicella vaccine, 42 HIV-infected children aged 1 to 8 years (stage N1 and Al) who had no history of varicella infection and had negative titers received two doses of the vaccine separated by 3 months. No severe adverse effects were reported. Fever occurred in 20% of the recipients after the first dose and in 5% after the second dose. Local reactions were similar to those seen in healthy children. After eight exposures, only one mild case of varicella occurred. Varicella-zoster virus antibody and specific lymphocyte proliferation were respectively detected in 48% and 63% of patients after the first and 56% and 82% of patients after the second dose.= Susceptible children with HIV infection exposed to varicella should receive passive immunization with varicella-zoster immunoglobulin given within 96 hours of exposure.

Therapy should be individualized, but around-the-clock therapy is preferred to intermittent dosing. Intramuscular and subcutaneous routes should be avoided, and oral and IV routes are preferred. The use of behavioral techniques also has a significant role.74 From the beginning, an open and sincere relationship should exist between physicians, patients, and patients' families.

As children enter late childhood and adolescence, they should be aware of their diagnoses. Children with other chronic diseases who know their diagnoses have been shown to cope better with their illness than those who do not know their diagnoses. In past years, families have been afraid to tell their children about their HIV infection because of the fear that these children will disclose to others and the family would be stigmatized or because of denial or guilt about transmitting the infection to their children, but an ongoing dialogue with the family regarding the importance of disclosure is important. The age, maturity, and social circumstance of these children must be taken into consideration, and disclosure should be done in a language and at a level that these children understand. Neuropsychological testing can guide the practitioner in determining the developmental age of a child. Simple, uncomplicated explanations can be given to children under 10 years of age, but older children and adolescents should have full disclosure, conveying an understanding of how the infection is transmitted, how to protect others from getting the infection, and a sense of responsibility for their health. These children should become active participants in their health care. As children reach adolescence, issues of compliance arise, and teenagers should be able to express opinions on the type of medication regimen they can accommodate, with full realization of the consequences of not taking their medication. Disclosure may occur through the family or guardian of the child or with assistance of the physician and the social worker. The counseling session should include a discussion of who must or should know about the diagnosis. The authors encourage telling siblings who are mature enough to handle the responsibility of knowing this information so that they can be supportive of the infected child. Physicians should answer questions openly and truthfully to prevent misconceptions about the illness. At each subsequent visit, physicians should allow the children to ask questions regarding the diagnosis. After disclosure, the children should be given the opportunity to speak with another infected child or attend a peer support group so they do not feel isolated?, 54 SUMMARY Significant advances have been made in the understanding of the pathophysiology of HIV infection since the beginning of the epidemic. T h s knowledge has translated into the development of new therapies for HIV and opportunistic infections, laboratory advances in monitoring viral and immune status, and a better understanding of factors affecting patient outcome. Concomitantly, significant progress has been made in the medical management of children with HIV infection in the past 5 years. The number of children reported with AIDS in the United States is decreasing, and efforts are shifting from caring for children with advanced immunosuppression and severe opportunistic infections to early HAART, maintenance of the immune system, and prevention of opportunistic infections. Primary care physicians are now more involved and informed in the care of HIV-infected patients. Although published data are limited, physicians who have been working with this population have observed a dramatic improvement in the quality of life and length of survival of these patients. Unfortunately, this progress is not shared by developing countries where resources are minimal and antiretroviral agents are commonly unavailable. Although efforts to develop a vaccine to prevent HIV infection are ongoing, progress has been slow. Education and awareness continue to be the most powerful weapons against HIV. ",
