Objective: This study aimed to investigate the association of innate and adaptive immunity with acute asthma attacks by analysing the role of IFN-\u2425-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), TLR2, cathelicidin, vitamin D and cytokines. Material and methods: This prospective study included 33 patients with viral-induced acute asthma and 30 children with controlled asthma. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected for virus identification and asthma attack scores assessed in acute asthma group. Blood sampling for IP-10, TLR2, cathelicidin, vitamin D levels, and spirometric indices were employed. Results: Serum IP-10 and cathelicidin levels of acute asthma group were significantly higher and vitamin D levels were lower than controlled asthma group (IP-10; p = 0.006, cathelicidin; p = 0.002, vitamin D; p < 0.001). Serum IP-10 levels showed a significant negative correlation with age (p = 0.009), TLR2 (p = 0.05) and spirometric indices (p = 0.002) in all asthmatics and a significant positive correlation with parameters of asthma attack severity (p = 0.03) in acute asthma group. Higher cathelicidin values showed significant positive relation to IP-10 (beta coefficient: 33, p = 0.02). Serum IP-10 levels higher than 38.9 pg/ml (sensitivity: 85%, The relation of IP-10 and cathelicidin with acute asthma attacks 161 specificity: 47%, p = 0.002) were predictive of virus-induced asthma. Serum IP-10 and vitamin D levels were found to be significantly related to viral-asthma attacks (IP-10; aOR: 8.93, p = 0.03 and vitamin D; aOR: 0.82, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Innate immunity biomarkers such as serum IP-10 and cathelicidin can be used to predict viral-induced acute asthma. These biomarkers may provide potential new treatment targets for acute asthma.",

The innate immune system plays a crucial role in the defense against microbes as well as in the initiation of inflammatory responses. Cathelicidin is a multifunctional host defense molecule that has several effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems that may be relevant in the modulation of infections (Fig. 1) . It has the potential to influence and modulate Toll-like receptor (TLR) mediated responses and the activity of various cell populations involved in inflammatory processes. Cathelicidins also promote the production of type 1 interferons, which are the important part of the innate immune response to microbes. 4, 5 The role of cathelicidins in viral-induced asthma exacerbations is not well known.",

It is secreted from cells stimulated with type I and II IFNs and lipopolysaccharide. 8, 9 The expression of IP-10 is observed in many Th1-type inflammatory diseases, in which it is considered to play an important role in recruiting activated T cells into sites of tissue inflammation. 10, 11 It has also been shown to be increased in the airways of asthmatics. 8, 10 However, its regulation in Th2-type inflammation and viral-induced asthma still remains elusive.

            "text": "The inflammatory process in asthma, including multiple cell types and mediators, is quite complex. 6 Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of viral-induced asthma is clearly different from the pathogenesis of allergen-induced asthma and is poorly understood. 3 The present study showed that serum IP-10, and cathelicidin levels were significantly higher and vit D levels were lower in the acute asthma group than the controlled asthma. Serum IP-10 levels showed a significant negative correlation with age. An inverse correlation was found between IP-10, cathelicidin and TLR2 levels. Higher cathelicidin values were found to be positively related to serum IP-10 levels. In the acute asthma group, a significant positive correlation was found between IP-10 and the parameters of asthma attack severity. Moreover, a significant negative correlation was found between serum IP-10 levels and spirometric indices. We demonstrated that high serum IP-10 levels were predictive of viral-induced acute asthma. Viral respiratory tract infections have long been recognized to be among the most important triggers of asthma attacks. 3, 20 Most research about the mechanism of viral-induced asthma attacks has focused on rhinovirus. 20, 21 The identification of impaired innate immunity in asthma suggests a possible mechanism for virus-induced asthma exacerbations. 22 Viruses are recognized by TLRs, which are the important components of the innate immune. The interactions between virus and TLR signaling cascades result in the activation of type 1 interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines and IP-10. 21 We also confirmed that serum IP-10 levels were significantly higher in the viral-induced asthma attack group. Another innate immune molecule, human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, which is a multifunctional host defence molecule is essential for normal immune responses to infections. 23---25 In addition to the antimicrobial effects, cathelicidin also has immunomodulatory properties such as chemoattractant function, inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis, tissue regeneration and cytokine release. 26, 27 Previous studies suggested that cathelicidin could be used as a marker for a strong systemic immune response in viral or bacterial infections. 28, 29 Similarly, the current study and our previous report revealed that serum cathelicidin levels were significantly higher in the viral-induced acute asthma group. 30 Although the exact reasons for the dependency of IP-10 production on age remain elusive, the reason could be related to Th1-dominant immune responses, such as virus infections. In the study of Kato et al., serum IP-10 showed an inverse correlation with age. 31 Similarly, we demonstrated a significant negative correlation between serum IP-10 and age. Further work is needed to explore the relationship between age and IP-10 production.",

            "text": "Type 1 IFNs are an important part of the innate immune response to microbes. 32 The antimicrobial peptide, cathelicidin, promotes type 1 IFN production. 5 Recently, cathelicidins have been observed to augment interferon-\u2424 expression and antiviral activity induced by double-stranded RNA in keratinocytes. 33 In the present study, higher cathelicidin values were found to be a significant factor that could influence serum IP-10 levels. We could not measure type 1 IFNs, but higher IP-10 values in the acute asthma group could depend on the overproduction of type 1 IFNs which were possibly upregulated by cathelicidin. We found no significant difference in IFN-\u2425 production between the two asthma groups despite the higher serum IP-10 levels in the acute asthma group. In a recent report, IP-10 was shown to be induced in bronchial epithelial cells infected by rhinovirus through a mechanism that was not dependent on prior induction by either IFN-\u2425 or the type I IFNs. 31 Serum cathelicidin levels showed a significant positive correlation with IL-6 and a negative correlation with IL-4 and IL-13 levels in our study. Previous studies showed that human cathelicidin elicited a modest up-regulation of IL-6 gen expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 34 The anti-inflammatory properties of cathelicidin are demonstrated by its antagonistic action on IL-4 responses. 5 In addition, IP-10 may also contribute to this antagonistic action on IL-4. The overexpression of IP-10 decreased IL-4 release and eosinophil recruitment to the airways in an OVA-sensitized mouse model. 35 IP-10 interacts with CXCR3, a receptor that is highly expressed on activated CD4+, CD8+ and NKT cells and stimulates the migration of these cells. 11 T cells expressing CXCR3 were associated with Th1 inflammation and IP-10 were even reported to show antagonistic effects on the Th2 cell mediated immune response. 36 The modulation of TLR function by cathelicidin can be considered an anti-inflammatory effect. 5 Cathelicidin downregulates signaling through TLR4, 37 whereas it stabilizes TLR3 ligands and enhances viral responses transmitted via this receptor in bronchial epithelial cells. 38 Although the cathelicidin molecule has a general anti-inflammatory effect on TLR stimulation by inhibiting the pro-inflammatory cytokine release from monocytic cells stimulated with TLR2 and TLR4, it can enhance or abrogate inflammatory signals depending on cell type and the microenvironment. 4, 5 In the present study, significant negative correlations between TLR2 and cathelicidin and IP-10 were shown. A relationship between TLR2 and IP-10 is less well characterized as it has both synergistic and antagonistic effects between TLR2 and TLR3 pathways, which may be stimulus dependent. 39, 40 Wood et al. showed that IP-10 gen expression in sputum was correlated with TLR2 and TLR3 in viral-induced acute asthma. 41 Vit D has several effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems. Vit D has been shown to inhibit IFN-\u2425 gene and protein expression through the Vitamin D receptorretinoid X receptor complex. Vitamin D receptor agonists can reduce the release of IP-10, a powerful chemokine driving Th1-mediated inflammation. 42 Kuo et al. found that 1\u2423,25-(OH) vitamin D could significantly suppress Th1related chemokine IP-10. 43 Moreover, Banerjee et al. found that calcitriol inhibited IP-10 secretion in a concentrationdependent manner in TNF\u2423-treated cells. 13 Although we found a negative correlation between vitamin D and IP-10 on the border of significance, lower serum vitamin D levels in viral-induced acute asthma could be considered to contribute to higher IP-10 levels.",

Viral infections may lead to the release of IP-10 in bronchial epithelium that enhances the asthmatic airway inflammation and migration and the activation of mast cells into the airway smooth muscle. 45, 46 These data clearly indicate that in individuals with pre-existing asthmatic airway inflammation, IP-10 is capable of worsening the inflammation and bronchoconstriction. Moreover, the involvement of IP-10 may explain the lack of corticosteroid efficacy in virus-induced asthma. Wark et al. confirmed that the levels of serum IP-10 of subjects with acute asthma were strongly associated with more severe airflow obstruction and a reduced \u24242-agonist bronchodilator response. 46 A previous study by Medoff et al. showed that IP-10 contributed to airway hyperreactivity and airway inflammation in a mouse model of asthma. 8 In the present study, a significant positive correlation was found between IP-10 and the parameters of asthma attack severity in the acute asthma group. Also, a significant negative correlation was found between serum IP-10 levels and spirometric indices.",
