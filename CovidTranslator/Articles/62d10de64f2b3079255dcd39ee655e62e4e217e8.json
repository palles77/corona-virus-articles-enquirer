If properly acclimated, they can thrive indoors, outdoors, or in a combination of both in most climates. 2 It is not advisable to allow ferrets to roam freely in the home. Their curiosity level, combined with a small, flexible, tubular-shaped body, enables them to both gain access to and escape from areas that pose little to no concern with many other pet species. They, therefore, should be housed in a secure, appropriate cage or enclosure and should only be allowed to roam outside the enclosure in a ferret-proofed area while under close supervision. Ferrets are especially fond of crawling into furniture and piles of laundry and seem to have a predilection for soft rubber items. 1, 3 The author has treated many cases of \"ferret versus recliner,\" clothes dryer-associated heatstroke, and television remote button ingestion. Ferrets are also not suitable for young children due to their ability to inflict a severe bite and the risk of blunt trauma from not-so-gentle handling. 3 Examples of suitable indoor ferret housing are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Multiple levels and vertical climbing options are suitable for younger ferrets. Older ferrets or those with medical conditions, rendering them less active or at risk of injury from routine play-related falls, should be allocated more horizontal space on a single level.",

Additionally, some high-end feline diets seem to work well for some ferrets. In short, there is no one perfect formulated diet that can be recommended universally and owners need to be advised that they may have to do some experimenting to find which works best for their individual ferrets. 2, 4 The author advises clients to find 2 to 4 brands with the appropriate composition of protein and fat and feed in combination. Because ferrets experience olfactory imprinting, it is wise to expose young ferrets to various foods early. Additionally, with the recent trend in frequent pet food recalls, this ensures that ferrets are not subjected to sudden diet changes if one of the main dietary components becomes unavailable.",

Because this disease is considered universally fatal in ferrets, vaccination for CDV should be considered every bit as important as rabies vaccination. 4 Choosing a vaccine in this case is not as easy. Various multivalent canine vaccine products were used successfully prior to the introduction of ferret-licensed monovalent vaccines. A safe and effective vaccine has been on the market for ferrets for years, 12 but availability from the manufacturer has become inconsistent recently and, at the time of this writing, the product has been on long-term back order. It is suspected that it may not be returning to the market and veterinarians again forced to choose from available canine products for off-label use. Although some practitioners choose not to vaccinate in the absence of a labeled product, the deadly nature of this disease necessitates that owners be involved in a discussion of all options available. If an owner elects to vaccinate with an off-label product, a vaccine with the fewest components should be chosen. Distemper/parvovirus combination vaccines are generally used by most clinicians. If owners choose to forego vaccination, they need to be advised to avoid any possible source of exposure-these include allowing ferrets outdoors with access to the ground; bringing any new dogs into the household; and walking in the house with shoes on after having visited a shelter, dog park, or other area frequented by a higher than average number of dogs of undetermined vaccination status. Vaccinated household dogs can bring the virus in on their feet as well. The myriad sources of exposure is generally sufficient to convince an owner that it is a wiser choice to vaccinate.",

It was initially speculated that this disease may have jumped species or that it was a mutation of the coronavirus causing FECV. Recent research has determined, however, that it is a distinct virus. 15 Therefore, it is unlikely that prior infection with FECV provides protection from this disease, which is eventually fatal. Owners should be made aware, however, that transmission is much more difficult, requiring intimate contact between ferrets (as with feline infectious peritonitis transmission in felids), and most exposed ferrets never develop the disease.",

Prior to emergence of deslorelin implants, leuprolide acetate was under investigation for preventive use. 20, 21 With the availability of deslorelin implants, potential prevention becomes a more convenient and economical option. 9 Investigation regarding the true efficacy of this practice is still in the early stages, but the general consensus is that it is currently appropriate to use these implants for preventive purposes. Owners may initially balk at the expense of placing an implant so closely after the series of first year vaccinations (which are often a surprise to new owners because many pet stores fail to disclose that young ferrets have only received the first in a series of at least 2, but more likely 3, CDV). For those owners receptive to this option, implants ideally should be placed in December or January of a male ferret's first year and in January or February of a female ferret's. Insufficient data exist at this time to suggest a definitive interval for replacement, although the labeled usage for therapeutic use is for 1 year. The author finds that a majority of owners who have had experience with adrenal gland disease and its various sequelae are rarely hesitant to invest in potential prevention.",

Because it has been determined to have a familial pattern of inheritance in both humans and dogs, this may be the case in ferrets as well. Cystine urolithiasis is much more common in the United States, where extensive inbreeding is a problem. This is compelling evidence that there may be a hereditary factor. 22 It is too soon, however, to rule out diet as a factor and a combination of the 2 may prove causative.

Blood work should be advised at this time, at least annually. Dental and periodontal disease generally begins to develop at this age, so regular dental prophylaxis should be performed or at least discussed with owners. 10 If changes in the teeth referable to diet (abrasion from hard kibble or calculus deposition secondary to soft or high-carbohydrate diets) are observed, dietary management/changes can be discussed with owners in addition to any recommendations for transitioning to a diet more appropriate for a senior ferret. 24 Regarding dramatic weight and coat loss, it is normal for ferrets to experience weight loss of up to 40% during spring or summer (timing may vary by geographic locale). The winter coat also normally sheds at this time. These changes should not be confused with hyperadrenocorticism or other diseases for which these findings can be characteristic. If ferrets are active and eating well and there are no additional findings on physical examination, owners should be advised to monitor ferrets and expect weight gain and hair regrowth.

Domestic ferrets, when given the opportunity, usually accept and engage with other ferrets. A huge proportion of their energy can be exhausted in this sort of social setting with no more investment from owners other than to be present to supervise, then sit back and enjoy the show. Well-socialized ferrets stalk, pounce, chase, and wrestle, engaging in an exhibition of their natural predatory, territorial, and breeding behaviors. Bonded ferrets usually prefer to sleep piled on top of one another. When choosing to house multiple ferrets together, most rescue organizations advise keeping a minimum of 3 ferrets, because they have a tendency to develop extremely strong bonds and the loss of a single companion can have detrimental consequences for a surviving ferret. Many ferrets experience grieving as is seen in species that mate for life, the severity of which can require hospitalization for prolonged anorexia, relapse of a previously controlled Helicobacter gastritis, or stress-induced gastrointestinal ulceration. Methods of introduction are beyond the scope of this article and are discussed in detail elsewhere. 25, 26 A ferret's housing in and of itself can be a source of enrichment.
