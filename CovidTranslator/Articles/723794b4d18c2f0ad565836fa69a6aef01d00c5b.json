Significant correlations were found between NW LDH and NW cytokines/ chemokines. Similarly, NW LDH correlated with NW-caspase 3/7 activity (r=0.75; P<.001). In a multivariate analysis, NW LDH concentration in the upper quartile was significantly associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization (odds ratio: 0.19; 95% confidence interval: 0.05-0.68; P=0.011).",

[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the chief cause of hospitalization for respiratory tract illness in young children 8, 9 and the most common agent recovered from children with bronchiolitis. 10 There is a need to have a biochemical marker of disease severity to assist the clinician in determining the need for hospitalization in children with bronchiolitis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be such a biochemical marker because of its relation to tissue injury. LDH is a membrane-associated protein involved in the oxidation of various organic substrates. 11 It is present in all major organ systems, and when found extracellularly, indicates cell damage and inflammation. 12 Measurement of LDH in bronchoalveolar fluid is commonly done as a surrogate for the presence of leukocytes and overall inflammation. In children with RSV bronchiolitis, neutrophils account for over 90% of total cells in nasal washes (NWs) and more than 70% in bronchoalveolar fluid. 13, 14 LDH activity in NW and serum has not been reported for children with bronchiolitis.",

            "text": "We did not observe a correlation between NW and serum LDH. This indicates that LDH in nasal secretions is unlikely to be derived from capillary extravasation of protein into the airways. Supporting this notion, studies evaluating LDH concentration in bronchoalveolar fluid concluded that its source is different from serum. 22, 23 When considering the relation of NW-to-serum LDH as a ratio, a factor \u22650.6 was more likely to be present in children being sent home from the ED compared to those admitted for supportive care (P = .003, data not shown). Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that LDH originates from widespread airway epithelial cell injury and apoptosis 21, 22, 24 or from leukocytes (largely polymorphonuclear cells) 25 present in the NW fluid. The strong correlation between NW LDH, IL-8 and GM-CSF supports polymorphonuclear cells and other leukocytes as a source for LDH, while the near linear correlation with caspase 3/7 suggest apoptosis is contributing to NW LDH. A better understanding of the source of the NW LDH may provide additional information on the early innate mechanisms involved in virus-induced bronchiolitis.",

            "text": "RSV is the major etiologic agent of bronchiolitis and our data reflect this fact with 66% of cases attributed to RSV. Intuitively, elevated concentrations of RSV should be closely linked to more severe bronchiolitis disease. Previous studies support this theory. [26] [27] [28] DeVincenzo et al analyzed 141 infants infected with RSV who were hospitalized during 4 winter seasons. Markers of disease severity included requirement for intensive care, respiratory failure, and duration of hospitalization. An increased NW RSV load was a significant independent predictor of all 3 markers of disease severity. 27 Buckingham et al 26 studied with RSV infection who were hospitalized. Mean NW concentrations were significantly higher in patients who required mechanical ventilation (5.06 \u00b1 0.34) compared to those who did not (3.91 \u00b1 0.35). In contrast, Wright et al 29 examined RSV titers in NW samples from 77 infants who were hospitalized with bronchiolitis, and did not find demonstrable correlation between viral titer and severity of illness. Martin et al 30 described patients with respiratory infection attributed to RSV where, after adjusting for age and the presence of comorbidities, the frequency of hospitalization decreased with each log increase in viral load (OR: 0.8 [95% CI: 0.7-0.997]; P = .047). The strong correlation we observed between NW LDH and RSV viral load (as quantified by real-time PCR) was not present when only infectious virus was assessed (P = .05) with the plaque assay (Fig 1A-C) . We attribute this discrepancy to the possible presence of RSV neutralizing antibodies in nasal secretions [disproved by Wright et al 29 ] or an increased precision of PCR over traditional methods [disproved by Bae et al 31 ].",

            "text": "Significant correlations were observed between NW LDH and various cytokines and chemokines, which may reflect the activation of parallel biological responses related to viral infection and innate and adaptive immune system activation. Aberrant Th2 immune responses 32 and mutations in genes involved in the innate immunity have been linked to RSV bronchiolitis susceptibility and severity. 33, 34 However, recent data suggest that cytokine levels do not necessarily correlate with disease presentation. 35 Welliver et al 24 showed that infants with fatal RSV lower respiratory tract disease succumbed to overwhelming viral infection and epithelial cell apoptosis and not to a cytokine storm. Lung sections were characterized by a paucity of lymphocytes and natural killer cells, unchecked viral replication, and apoptotic crisis. These recent studies support the concept of a protective effect derived from a robust innate immune response during an episode of RSV bronchiolitis, where inflammatory markers inversely correlate with disease severity. 15, 24, 35 To date there is no biochemical marker predictive of disease severity in children with bronchiolitis. In our study, the sensitivity and specificity of NW LDH for predicting hospitalization was 81% and 77%, respectively. These values are comparable to many of the point-of-care tests used in diagnosing a viral infection. The LDH assay is easy to perform, inexpensive, and available in most clinical laboratories. At our institution, the expected turnaround time for serum LDH is 1 hour, and NW samples should not be treated differently. Currently the presence of hypoxemia, significant respiratory distress and clinical judgment are the main consideration for determining the need to hospitalize a child with bronchiolitis. Having a validated biochemical marker predictive for hospitalization can provide another objective parameter to the physician, and would be valuable in difficult-toassess cases.",
