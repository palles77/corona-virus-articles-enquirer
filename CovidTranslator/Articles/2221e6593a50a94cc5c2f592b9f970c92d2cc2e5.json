In doing so, they expect to sustain economic growth but, on the other hand, will consume a considerable amount of energy. Nevertheless, the causal relationship between economic growth and electricity consumption in this type of serviceoriented territories has never been investigated. Using the historical data obtained from the Government of Macao SAR, we found that electricity consumption and economic growth in terms of gross domestic product are co-integrated for the period of 1999 Quarter 1e2008 Quarter 4. Moreover, vector error correction (VEC) models indicated a lack of short-run relationships but showed that there was a long-run equilibrium relationship between electricity consumption and gross domestic product. The accuracy of VEC models was assessed by using the mean squared error and the mean absolute error. The error analysis shows that VEC models reproduced time series of gross domestic product and electricity consumption in difference form accurately.",

            "text": "Macao, a special administrative region in the People's Republic of China, has experienced a phenomenal economic growth since the liberalization of the gaming industry in 2002. According to the statistics provided by the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau of Macao, gross revenue from Macao's casinos amounted to US$13.6 billion in 2008, representing an increase of 31% on year-toyear basis [1] . This figure exceeded the gross income of US$6.12 billion from Las Vegas Strip's casinos as reported by the Nevada Gaming Commission by a very wide margin. The direct taxes from gaming amounted to US$4.9 billion in 2008, representing 77% of the total income of the Government of Macao SAR. Besides, the annualized gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in Macao was estimated as US$39,036 at the end of 2008, higher than that of Hong Kong and Singapore. As the majority of Macao GDP (62.25%) depends on the gaming and the associated hospitality services provided to visitors, the change in GDP is a good proxy for economic growth in Macao e the world gaming center. In fact, many Asian cities including Singapore and Penghu of Taiwan have decided or proposed to jump on the bandwagon. However, this type of service industry, like the manufacturing sector, consumes a substantial amount of electricity to operate and brighten its infrastructure such as casinos, hotels, resorts, and meeting, exhibition and convention venues day and night. To cope with the increasing demand of electricity consumption, public policy makers in those cities need to have a better understanding on the relationships between economic activities, electricity consumption, and economic growth.",

            "text": "Numerous studies have been conducted to examine the relationship between electricity consumption and various economic indicators in the past fifty years. In the 1950s, Houthakker [2] analyzed electricity demand on domestic two-part tariffs for 42 provincial towns in the U.K. He found that average annual electricity consumption per consumer was a function of the average income per household, marginal price of elasticity and marginal price of competing forms of energy, such as gas. Houthakker also reported that the monthly electricity consumption of families had a strong seasonal variation, depending on average temperature and average hours of daylight per day for each month. Foss [3] studied the utilization of capital equipment and suggested that electricity consumption was an indicator of capital usage, especially in an industrial country such as the USA. Foss's idea was adopted by Jorgensen and Griliches [4] and Heathfield [5] to measure capital usage using electricity consumption data. Mount et al. [6] analyzed both the short-run and long-run demand for electricity for three classes of consumers, namely residential, commercial and industrial. They demonstrated that long-run electricity demand was generally price elastic and became increasingly elastic as prices rose. In contrast, demand was general inelastic with respect to income, especially for residential and industrial classes that approached zero as income increased. Population exhibited approximately unit elasticity for all classes implying the common practice of estimating demand models on a per capita basis to be reasonable. In the past decade, researchers [7e12] studied the modeling of electricity consumption in different countries or cities. When annual data were used, researchers [8, 10] found that gross national product (GNP) or its derivative such as the number of tourists in a tourist center was the major determinant of electricity consumption. When monthly data were used, researchers found that population (POP), temperature (TEMP) and other economic or industrial factors are the major determinants of electricity consumption [7, 9, 11, 12] . Moreover, Pao [11] reported that economic indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) and consumer price index (CPI) have a very weak instantaneous effect on Taiwan's electricity consumption. Lai et al. [12] used multiple regression, artificial neural work (ANN), and wavelet-ANN to model electricity consumption in Macao for the period of January 2000eDecember 2006. The results show that the total monthly electricity consumption depends on economic factors such as the number of visitors and their hotel-room occupancy rate, demographic and climatic conditions in Macao. Most of the more recent studies show electricity consumption to be strongly associated with the business activities of a country or city.",

            "text": "In pioneering the study of causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth, Kraft and Kraft [13] used annual data on gross energy inputs and GNP between 1947 and 1974 in the USA and utilized the test for unidirectional causality as outlined by Sims [14] . They found the evidence of a unidirectional causality running from GNP to energy consumption. Yu and Hwang [15] reexamined the causality between energy consumption and GNP over the time period of 1947e1979 using annual data. However, they did not find any evidence to support any causality between energy consumption and GNP over the entire sample period. When the time period was changed to 1973e1981 and quarterly data were used, Yu and Hwang [15] reported that unidirectional causality ran from GNP to energy consumption. A year later, Yu and Choi [16] studied the causal relationship between energy consumption and GNP using Sims and Granger causality tests for five countries. They reported that there was (i) no causal relationship between energy consumption and GNP in the USA, UK and Poland; (ii) unidirectional causality from GNP to energy consumption in South Korea; and (iii) unidirectional causality from energy consumption to GNP in the Philippines. Nachane et al. [17] used EngleeGranger co-integration approach [18] to test the energyeGDP relationship over the time period 1950e51 to 1984e85 for 16 countries. They reported that there was long-run relationship between energy consumption and GDP for 11 developing countries and 5 developed countries. Since then, many researchers [19e34] adopted EngleeGranger co-integration approach or its modified version to study the causal relationship between energy consumption or electricity consumption and economic growth such as GDP or GNP. Table 1 summarizes the empirical findings of the causality tests between energy consumption and economic growth over the past three decades. The results from more recent studies [23e34] showed that there was in general a relationship between energy consumption and economic growth. More specifically, Chontanawat et al. [32] suggested that causality from energy to GDP was found to be more prevalent in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries compared to the developing non-OECD countries. However, when it comes to whether the increase in energy consumption is a result of or a cause of economic growth, there is no conclusive agreement on this issue, possibly due to other exogenous factors that may affect energy consumption and GDP simultaneously or sequentially (but have been ignored in most prior studies). Therefore, our study was aimed at studying the relationship between electricity consumption and GDP with the number of tourists and population as important exogenous factors in the world's gaming center e Macao SAR using Johansen's methodology [35] .",

It might be true that when quarterly data are used (let alone the annual data), for example, a simple causal model is not sufficient to explain the relationships between the variables, while for monthly data a simple causal model would be all that is required. Thus, some nonsimple causal models may be constructed not because of the basic properties of the economy being studied but because of the data being used. It has been shown elsewhere that a simple causal mechanism can appear to be a feedback mechanism if the sampling period for the data is so long that details of causality cannot be picked out.\" (Granger, 1969 , p. 427) Table 1 shows that there were relative few studies on the causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth employed quarterly data and most of previous studies were all based on annual data. As the increase in GDP and electricity consumption is more pronounced only after Macao was returned to mainland China in 1999, our study decided to use quarterly data because of the number of data points available and its better ability to capture short-term changes.

Therefore, the ADF statistics show that all investigated variables including LGDPSA, LELECSA, LPOP and LTOURSA were integrated of order one, I(1), which are normal for typical economic parameters.

First, the goodness of fit of a VEC model describes how well the regenerated data fit a set of observations as it measures the variability between the actual data and the estimated data using VEC equations. The adjusted coefficient of determination (adjusted R 2 ) was used to indicate the goodness of fit of the model investigated. The higher adjusted R 2 , the better goodness of fit. Moreover, the stability of VEC models is a statistical property of continuance to estimate the stable distributions provided by a linear combination of variables in models. For example, structural changes and/or discontinues in the data typically may cause unstable in estimated models. In VEC models, we applied unit-root tests for determining model stability. Furthermore, t-tests and Wald tests were applied to test whether the long-run relationships and short-run causalities exist in VEC models. In Wald tests, chi-square c 2 statistics and their probabilities were obtained to determine the short-run causalities in VEC models, respectively. When the probability of chi-square statistics was below 5 percent, the null hypothesis was rejected based on the 5 percent significance level, implying a VEC model having a short-run causal relationship between dependent and independent variables.

Vector error correction models indicated that there was a long-run unidirectional causal relationship from gross domestic product to electricity consumption. Moreover, given a change in gross domestic product, gross domestic product and electricity consumption interacted in shortterm and then re-established the long-run equilibrium. Co-integration test showed that seasonally adjusted gross domestic product, electricity and tourists' amount in natural log scale (LGDPSA, LELECSA and LTOURSA) were co-integrated. Although in previous section, we adopted the VEC model with DLGDPSA and DLELECSA only, change in the number of tourists (DTOURSA) will have a peculiar effect on DLGDPSA than on DLELECSA. It can be understood because the gaming and tourism center in Asia Macao SAR depends heavily on the tourism industry (but in fact more on the high rollers among those tourists). The number of tourists (more specifically, the number of high rollers) affects significantly and positively on gross domestic product and in turn affects electricity consumption. A detailed observation of the DLELECSA VEC equation reveals that DLELECSA depends heavily and significantly on the lag 1 of DLGDPSA. This implies that in a service-oriented territory, infrastructures such as casinos, hotels, resorts, convention centers, food-serving outlets, etc. have to be built (leading to a sudden increase in GDPSA) and operated to attract tourists, consequently leading to a positive change in the city's or national electricity consumption.",
