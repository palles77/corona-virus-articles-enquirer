            "text": "The Zika virus outbreak has captivated the attention of the global audience and information has spread rapidly and wildly through the internet and other media channels. This virus was first identified in 1947, when it was isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey placed by British scientists working at the Yellow Fever Research Laboratory located in the Zika forest area of Uganda, hence its name, and is transmitted primarily by the mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. The fact that the rhesus macaque is an Asian species being placed in an African forest brings to mind the possibility of rapid adaptation of the virus from an African to Asian species, an issue that has not been considered. Whether such adaptation has played any role in acquiring pathogenicity due to cross species transmission remains to be identified. The first human infection was described in Nigeria in 1954, with only scattered reports of about a dozen human infections identified over a 50-year period. It was not until 2007 that Zika virus raised its ugly head with infections noted in three-quarters of the population on the tiny island of Yap located between the Philippines and Papua New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean, followed by a major outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013. The virus remained confined to a narrow equatorial band in Africa and Asia until 2014 when it began to spread eastward, first toward Oceania and then to South America. Since then, millions of infected individuals have been identified in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, including 25 additional countries in the Americas. While the symptoms associated with Zika virus infection are generally mild, consisting of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia and conjunctivitis, there have been reports of more severe reactions that are associated with neurological complications. In pregnant women, fetal neurological complications include brain damage and microcephaly, while in adults there have been several cases of virus-associated Guillain-Barre syndrome. The virus was until recently believed to only be transmitted via mosquitoes. But when the Zika virus was isolated from the semen specimens from a patient in Texas, this provided the basis for the recent report of possible sexual transmission of the Zika virus. Due to the neurological complications, various vectors for infection as well as the rapid spread throughout the globe, it has prompted the World Health Organization to issue a global health emergency. Various governmental organizations have recommended that pregnant women do not travel to countries where the virus is epidemic, and within the countries affected by the virus, recommendations were provided for women of childbearing age to delay pregnancy. The overall public health impact of these above findings highlights the need for a rapid but specific diagnostic test for blood banks worldwide to identify those infected and for the counseling of women who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy. As of this date, there are neither commercially licensed diagnostic tests nor a vaccine. Because crossreactivity of the Zika virus with dengue and Chikungunya virus is common, it may pose difficulty in being able to quickly develop such tests and vaccines. So far the most effective public health measures include controlling the mosquito populations via insecticides and preventing humans from direct exposure to mosquitoes.",

The news outlets have latched onto this hot item and have been bombarding the public with information that is both legitimate and misleading. The internet age has allowed rapid dissemination of such information, therefore causing rapid reactions or responses by both national and international agencies, regulatory bodies and professional organizations. The story of the impact the Zika virus has played upon humanity is an interesting and unique one, which has led to the government issuing non-traditional recommendations, in an effort to ensure the public's safety and health. Tracing the sequence of events from the discovery of the virus to the current state of affairs provides a useful learning tool that would allow effective responses during unexpected pandemics. Although there are over 325 published articles associated with the Zika virus, the majority coming out of Uganda, there is still little known about the potential of the virus [1].",

It is known to have spread to various geographic areas of Asia and the Pacific Islands, with the most recent spread eastward to the Americas. Earlier, symptoms associated with infection included a mild response, which included fever and fatigue, until this year when it was reported that pregnant women, primarily Brazilian women, that tested positive with the Zika virus had fetuses born with brain defects. After Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory virus (MERV), the Ebola outbreak, and recurrent re-emergence of measles, influenza, dengue and cholera throughout the globe, the world now has a new enemy to contend with, serving as a reminder that human beings live in a complex relationship with other organisms in an ecosystem that is often unpredictable [2] . The continuous encroachment of otherwise forested and/or remote habitats by humans in search of new space for housing and adventure combined with the ever increasing speed of inter-continental air travel logarithmically increases the likelihood of the jumping of microbial species from its natural habitat to urban locations. This is a reality to be faced by those involved in public health safety and will remain a continuing challenge to health care providers worldwide.",

            "text": "Several viruses were reported to have been isolated by a team of British and American scientists that were in charge of the Yellow Fever Virus Research Institute housed in Entebbe, Uganda during the late 1930's to late 1940's primarily with the aim of isolating yellow fever viruses (YFV) [3] . In efforts to isolate the YFV, these scientists placed Asian species rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) in sentinel cages atop forest canopy level platforms in the Zika Forest area located near Entebbe, Uganda, presumably in a location where they could serve as potential hosts for the local mosquito population known to be vectors of the YFV. Blood samples isolated from one of these \"sentinel\" rhesus macaques (monkey 766) when injected into the brains of Swiss albino mice led to sickness of these mice. Homogenates of brain tissues from these sick mice led to the isolation of several filterable viruses, amongst one that was called the Zika virus766 because of the forest and the number of the monkey (hence, its name) [4, 5] . These viruses were also isolated from mosquito populations from the same location and thus reasoned to be circulating and being kept endemic by virus host interactions between the indigenous monkey species (that include 13 species with the colobus species monkey being predominant) and mosquitoes. The fact that the virus was isolated from \"sentinel\" Asian rhesus macaques implies that there must have been an adaptation of the virus from the African monkey species to the Asian monkey species (jumping of species). Whether such adaptation was instrumental in further transmission of this virus and whether such adaptation led to increased pathogenicity remains unknown. It should be noted that sera collected from blood samples of several local individuals residing in the same area during the same time period were found to contain antibodies against the Zika virus presumably suggesting that the virus was already circulating in the human population. However, there were no reports of any disease. What is not clear is the specificity of the antibody test that was utilized at the time since there is considerable cross reactivity among the flaviviruses. It was first isolated from a human in 1969 in Nigeria, though the illness caused by the virus, Zika fever or Zika disease has been known to infect humans since the early 1950s [6] . A time line of the history of the Zika virus is shown in Fig. 1 ; the countries involved are shown in Table 1 .",

            "text": "The Zika virus belongs to the family Flaviviridae and the genus Flavivirus. Other Flaviviruses include yellow fever, dengue, West Nile and Japanese encephalitis viruses [8, 9] . Flaviviruses belong to a group of viruses labeled as \"arborviruses\", which is a descriptive term that refers to hundreds of RNA viruses which rely on arthropods such as mosquitoes or ticks for transmission. Arboviruses (arthropod borne viruses) cause some of the most devastating diseases in humans and animals worldwide. The families of RNA arboviruses include Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Togoviridae. The arboviruses are acquired orally by their hematogenous vectors in the form of a blood meal of an infected vertebrate host. These viruses are non-pathogenic to the vector but have to be able to survive in a live form in the vector which then transmits via saliva deposition into a new vertebrate host. This cycle is important to remember since the details of how the virus survives in the vector host and whether it replicates in the vector host, and if it replicates, the cell types that it infects in the vector and whether the virus changes in any form in the vector host (such as glycosylation of its envelope for example) are all important issues that influence the ability of the vector to transmit infection including the Zika virus. Evidence for recombination of the virus has already been documented to have potentially occurred by transmission of the virus via a different species of mosquitoes [10] . The Zika virus is closely related to the Spondweni virus. There are a total of seven groups of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, according to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). The groups are categorized based on antigenic and genetic considerations. The genus Flavivirus consists of 39 different mosquito-borne viruses [11] .",

The Zika virus is a positive polarity RNA virus with a genomic size of about 11 kb [12] . The single open reading frame sequence of its RNA genome encodes a polyprotein which constitutes the structural architecture of the virus [13] . This polyprotein contains 3 components, including a capsid (105 aa), membrane and premembrane portion (187 aa) termed C, M and P, respectively. There is also an envelope protein (E, 505 aa) and an addition 7 components that are non-structural (NS). These seven proteins are designated NS1 (352 aa), NS2a (217 aa), ND2b (139 aa), NS3 (619 aa), NS4a (127 aa), NS4b (255 aa) and NS5 904 aa) [14] . The non-structural proteins NS2B/NS3 includes a serine protease that along with host proteases co-translationally and posttranslation cleaves the polyprotein into its components. The envelope protein is the primary flavivirus antigenic site and dictates attachment of the virion and penetration into the host cell. Folding of the E protein is controlled by the premembrane protein, which is cleaved by furin to form the membrane protein prior to mature virion release from the cell [15] . The function of the remaining nonstructural proteins remain unknown, but may have specific essential roles in various replication stages. For example, NS5, the most highly conserved of the flavivirus NS proteins functions as a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [16] .",

Thus, there were cases reported in various parts of Africa that included one in Nigeria in 1971, one in Sierra Leone in 1972 and more recently in the Cape Verde Island. The other route of spread was Eastward to the Pacific Islands and Asia. Multiple arbovirus infections were reported in the late 1950s and early 1960s in East Africa, including Zika, yellow fever, Banzi, Wesselsbron, West Nile and dengue 1 (group-B arboviruses), chickungunya, o'nyong-yong and Sinbis (group-A arboviruses), and Bunyamwera virus [23] . Although known since 1947, extensive spread of the Zika virus to Asia probably only occurred as recently as 2012e2014 [24] . It is unknown what triggered the worldwide emergence of a disease confined to a narrow tropical band. RT-PCR based studies on the Zika virus suggest that genetic changes in protein glycosylation through recombination events may have led to a higher efficiency in transmission via mosquito vectors, thus facilitating changes in geographical spread patterns [10] .",

The increased incidence of microcephaly in infants born in Brazil led to the realization that there is an extremely likely association between brain damage and Zika virus infection, though even to this day this has not yet been definitively confirmed [8, 29] . In barely eight months, there have been over 4000 confirmed cases of microcephaly in Brazil, according to a report in the British Medical Journal published on the 26th of January, 2016 [30] . The virus is widespread in multiple regions and states in Brazil [31e33], and the reports of microcephaly coincide temporally with the appearance of the Zika virus in Brazil. Other Latin American countries have since reported cases of Zika virus infection [34, 35] . Tracing the route of spread, one theory is that the beginning of the disease in Brazil was caused by transmission from the outbreak in French Polynesia in 2014, which coincided with the World Cup football competition [36, 37] . In addition, it has been proposed that climate changes may have facilitated the spread of Zika virus to the Americas by virtue of the warmer temperatures and drought conditions observed in the second half of 2015 in South America. Drier conditions may have enhanced vector dispersal [38] .",

It is reasoned that most of these arboviruses remain endemic in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world that promote the life cycle of the arthropod. In most, if not all such cases, the virus in question does not cause any disease in its natural host. Thus, the infectious virus has to be present in sufficient quantity in the blood/tissues of the vertebrate host so that it is picked up by the arthropod when it bites the natural host. The infectious virus then has to survive in the arthropod and in some cases replicate in a specific tissue of the arthropod and once again be in sufficient infectious amounts to be delivered by the arthropod to another natural host to continue the cycle. Mosquitoes generally feed on plant nectars and it is primarily the female mosquito that feeds on vertebrate blood that is needed for the maturation of the eggs it carries. The average life span of a male mosquito is only 10 days and 1e2 months for the female and the range of a mosquito is 1e3 miles. Thus, female mosquitoes have to be transmission competent within this framework for the life cycle of the arbovirus to be complete. One study reported survival of the Zika virus for a period of two weeks in female mosquitoes, suggesting the stability of the virus in the vector host. As one may gather, these are rather stringent requirements for the life cycle of arboviruses and have evolved over millennia. It also seems clear that it is only when such viruses jump species (non-natural host), i.e. to humans, that we see evidence of disease often with serious pathology and, in a small number of cases, potential death of the host.",

The Zika virus is spread by mosquitoes belonging to the Aedes species [46] . In the Uganda forest which is the namesake of the Zika virus, mosquito population analysis revealed a total of 58 species. The mosquito species diversity is changing, as mosquito populations are constantly being monitored, and 22 of the 58 species were considered new to the Zika forest, and 20 previously detected species were no longer found at the time of this study. Of the 58 species detected in 2014, the majority belonged to the genera Aedes and Culex [47] . Changing biodiversity is influenced by human activity (building roads, communities, hunting, agricultural incursions, and timber harvesting) and changing climate [48] .",

This mosquito can breed in small quantities of water, and is known to be active and aggressive during the daytime hours, but especially during dusk or dawn in cloudy weather, and often indoors. This mosquito originated in Africa, but now can be found in almost all subtropical and tropical climates throughout the globe. Zika virus was isolated from the A. aegypti mosquito in Malaysia in 1969 [50] . In North America, the A. aegypti species are found primarily in Florida, but they have also been detected as far north as Washington, DC. The A. aegypti mosquito lives for 2e4 weeks, but its eggs can survive for long periods of time in a dry state, and are known to reintroduce large numbers of the mosquito after a cold, dry winter. Other diseases that are transmitted by the A. aegypti mosquito include dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya. A. aegypti has been identified to be the main vector for arboviruses in the Pacific region [51] . In Brazil, where recent Zika virus cases have exploded, the A. aegypti mosquito had been known for its ability to transmit related virus such as dengue or Chikungunya [52] .",

A. albopictus was believed to play a role in the Zika virus epidemic in Gabon in 2007 [54] . Because A. albopictus is present in Southern Europe, the WHO issued a warning to European countries to be on the lookout for potential cases of Zika infection [55] . An analysis of the transmission potential for the Zika virus by various species of the Aedes mosquito was conducted [56] . A. aegypti, A. albopictus, Aedes unilineatus and Aedes vittatus were all found to be susceptible to Zika virus infection. Interestingly, in this study performed in Senegal, A. aegypti was found to have low potential for transmission of the Zika virus, which was discordant with other findings from other studies and field observations [57] . Studies designed to define the range of vector species employed the use of murine skin explants that served as a barrier when placed on Zika virus heparinized human blood and the candidate mosquito species allowed to feed on such an in vitro culture system. The Aedes spp of mosquitoes were found to be easily infectable with the Zika virus using this technique [58] . Zika virus has also been isolated from Aedes africanus in the Lunyo forest on the shore of the Entebbe peninsula as early as 1948 [59] , and was again isolated from this strain of Aedes mosquitos caught from various heights of a 120 m tower in the Zika forest in Uganda in the early 1960s [60] .",

In addition, Foy et al. [67] has reported sexual transmission of the Zika virus to the wife of a patient who got infected in Senegal after his return to the US. The transmission was reasoned to be via semen but the semen was not tested. In this regard, it is important to note that Flaviviruses have been detected in urine samples of individuals infected with the West Nile virus with suggestive evidence that the virus was in fact replicating in these patients and being shed and thus thought to be infectious [68] . Similarly dengue virus RNA and non-structural protein of the dengue virus (NS1) has also been reported in urine samples of infected patients, but in vitro culture of the urine sample failed to show any evidence of replication competent virus. Finally, yellow fever virus RNA was shown to be present in the urine of a vaccinated individual [69] . More recently a case of sexual transmission of the Zika virus in Texas has been reported raising considerable concern among the public health officials in the state and at the CDC, Atlanta, GA.

            "text": "While there are similarities between dengue and Zika virus infection, there are some notable differences [75] . First of all, dengue infection is caused by four different serological types of dengue virus termed DEN 1, 2, 3 and 4. Infection with one type leads to life long immunity against the same type. However, exposure of the individual to a second type of dengue virus, in a small number of cases leads to a very severe form of illness resulting in shock and hemorrhage termed dengue shock syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever. This has not so far been reported for the Zika virus infections. The fever in dengue virus tends to be higher (>40 C versus <38.5 C). Nausea and vomiting can be a significant symptom in dengue virus. Headaches, retro-orbital pain and joint symptoms may occur in both infections. As indicated, in most cases, particularly in endemic countries, dengue infection is benign and limited to fever during the acute phase followed by a gradual return to normal. In the few cases with exposure to a secondary serological type of dengue, there are three distinct phases of disease: an acute febrile phase, a critical (plasma leak) phase where hematologic abnormalities, shock and death can occur, and a recovery phase. In Zika infections, the course is about 2e7 days and it is self-limiting. Secondary dengue infection often requires hospitalization and 2.5% of infected individuals will develop a lethal illness, but in Zika virus infections, most cases are managed on an outpatient basis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) can increase risk of bleeding in dengue, but are acceptable to use in Zika virus infection as long as dengue has been ruled out. Long term sequellae may persist in dengue infection for up to 2 years, while none have been associated with Zika virus infection in the primary host (i.e. not including fetal losses and complications in offspring). There may be an association with Guillain-Barre syndrome in Zika infection [76] ; this association has also been observed in dengue infection [77] . Laboratory findings in Zika virus infection include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyl transferase and increased levels of inflammatory markers such as Creactive protein, fibrinogen and ferritin [3, 44] .",

Thus, previously serological tests have been performed for the detection of antibodies. However, it is generally known that there is considerable cross reactivity between the various flaviviruses and thus the specificity of the test becomes an issue. There have also been plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) tests performed but the problem with such assays is that the presence of antibodies in the newborn could be due to passively transferred neutralizing antibodies from the mother, making it difficult to distinguish infection of the baby/ fetus. The more recently developed PCR assay can obviously be performed and yield valuable information. However, if the fetus was infected in utero with neurological sequellae including microcephaly, the period of viremia may have passed and thus negative findings may not be informative. Thus, there are clear challenges. These challenges are highlighted by the findings of the recent outbreak in Brazil. The latest data from the Ministry of Health, Brazil, shows that there were 4180 reported cases of microcephaly associated with Zika virus infection. Of these 4180 cases, 732 (17.5%) have been investigated and classified. Of the 732 classified cases 270 were confirmed to have neurological manifestations but only six of these 270 cases were found to be positive for Zika virus. These findings have to be interpreted with caution as outlined above. There have been no reported cases of microcephaly from Southeast Asia (could be due to lack of clinical awareness) but the outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013 and earlier in Brazil both did report associations of Zika virus infections with neurological complications such as Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS). It is clear therefore considerable challenges lie ahead in establishing a cause and effect and the mechanism of Zika virus infection and microcephaly. A case control study would be one answer.",

Murine monoclonal antibodies which are specific to the viral envelope glycoprotein and NS1 glycoprotein from West Nile virus and yellow fever virus were tested against the C1008 cell line experimentally infected with the Zika and Langat viruses. The Mab541 and Mab109 clones against the viral envelope glycoprotein and NS1 glycoprotein, respectively, were shown to stain the nucleus of Zika virus infected cells and the nucleoli of Langat virus infected cells, respectively but not the cytoplasm [83] . These findings first of all highlight the problems of cross reactivity between the various flaviviruses and secondly, that nuclear and nucleoli localization are difficult to interpret. Early development of testing for flavivirus infection involved the use of solid-phase immunosorbent techniques and hemagglutination-inhibition assays to detect the IgM isotype against specific viruses, especially during primary acute infection [84] . There have also been plaque reduction neutralization assays (PRNT) performed. However, much like the problems with the diagnosis of other flaviviruses such as dengue and yellow fever, the issue of specificity and cross reactivity remain and need to be addressed. Besides these serological assays, the assay of choice at present is the Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). False positives due to cross-reactivity represent a major challenge. The presence of nucleic acids in body fluids may not be persistent enough to accurately diagnose patients with active infection. There are no commercially available tests, and Zika testing is currently only performed at the CDC laboratory and at some state and regional health departments [85] .",

            "text": "The entire Zika ss(\u00fe) RNA genome consists of 10,794 nucleotides. Full length genomic sequencing of the Zika virus was accomplished in 2006 [86] . RT-PCR methods for the rapid detection and identification of flaviviruses, including Zika virus, were established as early as 1994 [87] . Original primers were derived from [30, 132] nucleotide sequences from the NS5 gene or from the 3'non-coding region. In 2008, an RT-PCR protocol utilizing sequences encoding the envelope protein region was developed. The detection limit was 7.7 pfu/reaction and the methodology was determined to be 100% sensitive in serum and specific by its failure to amplify genomes of 19 other flaviviruses [88] . In subsequent studies, polymerase chain reaction assays for Zika virus have mostly targeted the NS5 gene. The NS5 gene is chosen for primer development because this region displays a high degree of conservation among flaviviruses, while envelope protein genes may vary within a single flavivirus and thus present false negative data [89] . In a separate study, real time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) offers a quick and quantitative method to detect and evaluate the presence of Zika virus in mosquitoes. A method utilizing the NS5 protein coding regions was found to show high sensitivity for 37 Zika virus strains and specificity against other flavivirus strains. At the time of the study, this methodology had been tested on field mosquitoes and not yet applied for clinical diagnostic usage [90] . It is currently recommended that RT-PCR testing be done within the first 6 days of the onset of illness. It is also believed that in the early phases of the disease, the virus is present in its highest concentrations in the saliva, but that presence can be more persistent in the urine [91] , thus testing should be done from one of these two specimens. In a study of 855 patients presenting with symptoms of Zika virus infection, investigators in French Polynesia analyzed 1067 samples from saliva, blood or both sources. In 182 patients from whom both urine and saliva samples were available, there were 35 that were saliva positive, blood negative and 16 of which were saliva negative, blood positive. The timing of obtaining the samples revealed no pattern with regard to saliva versus urine positivity [92] . A separate study found the presence of Zika virus in the urine of 6 patients greater than 10 days after onset of symptoms [91] .",

Autophagosomes were shown to contain poliovirus particles in patients infected by the polio virus. The mechanisms by which viruses use autophagy to infect cells varies amongst viruses. For example, the dengue virus is able to reorganize membranes to form autophagosomes which can fuse with endosomes to form amphisomes. The dengue virus then is able to replicate inside these double membrane vesicles that are induced by the virus. A similar event is thought to occur with Zika viruses, but this has not been well characterized [94] . Flaviviruses including the Zika virus have been found to activate the unfolded protein response (UPR), which may play a role in autophagy which is linked to alterations in the function or degradation of endoplasmic reticulum architecture or composition [95] .",

Centrosomes are organelles that serve as the primary microtubule organizing centers of an animal cell. They have a role in mitosis and vesicle migration, polarization and trafficking. It has been demonstrated that increased centrosome number has been associated with microcephaly. It is not known if the Zika virus plays a direct role in centrosome development, but certain proteins have roles in both autophagy and centrosome development [96] . An increase in centrosome number can cause a delay in mitosis and an increase in apoptosis. This can lead to abnormalities in neural cell development and a consequence of this may be a reduction in brain matter formation or microcephaly [97] .",

The role of the skin in the pathogenesis of infection carries potential significance as an entry point into the body. Adhesion factors including AXL, Tyro3, and DC-SIGN were found to facilitate Zika virus entry into human skin cells. The phosphatidylserine receptor AXL was in particular found to be an entry receptor for the Zika virus. Dermal fibroblasts showed Zika permissiveness using specific RNA silencing and a neutralizing antibody. Transcription factors involved in the synthesis of the innate immune response molecules RIG-I, MDA5 and Toll like receptor (TLR)-3 were each enhanced following Zika virus infection. The fact that Axl tyrosine kinase is expressed by glioma cells provides a clue for its role in the pathology characterized to be associated with Zika virus infection. More recently, a potent inhibitor for Axl (BMS-777607) has been identified [101] , making this an interesting candidate for the study of therapeutic options. Interferon-stimulated genes were also enhanced. Autophagosomes induced by Zika infection of human skin fibroblasts was associated with increased viral replication using the autophagy inducer, Torin 1 and the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine [94] . Those who live in areas where Aedes spp mosquitoes exist should implement control measures such as the use of insect repellents such as DEET, use of mosquito nets at night and wearing light colored clothing and staying covered. The use of air-conditioning is also potentially effective in reducing risk for mosquito bites.",

In particular, automobile tires that tend to accumulate stagnant water and are dark seem to be a preferred breeding ground for mosquitoes, and should be removed. Climate changes should also be taken into consideration when discussing vector abundance issues. Global warming is a factor that drives vector abundance, as may changes in humidity or rainfall. In past studies of arbovirus circulation dynamics, rainfall negatively predicted dengue virus isolation, but positively predicted Zika virus isolation. Temperature had opposite effects on dengue versus yellow fever virus isolates.

There are 3 levels of travel advisory, Level 1 recommends practice usual precautions and level 3 recommends the avoidance of non-essential travel. 4 On January 19th, 2016, the CDC issued interim guidelines for pregnant females which included recommendations directed at the travel and screening of pregnant women to countries where Zika virus infection has been identified. The guidelines outlined symptoms such as fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis that occur within 2 weeks of travel should lead to an evaluation of the fetus by ultrasound to identify the presence or absence of fetal microcephaly or other abnormalities such as intracranial calcifications [106] . The guidelines include an algorithm for the management of these cases. Updated guidelines are expected. 5 On January 22nd, 2016, El Salvador issues a recommendation for women of childbearing age to delay pregnancy until 2018. This came after the release of a report of 492 cases found in El Salvador. The impact of this on population demographics and social structure can only be imagined. 6 Colombia has also issued warnings for women of child bearing age to not get pregnant until more information is known about spread and control. 7 The CDC issued interim guidelines for testing of infants with congenital Zika virus infection. These measures include fetal ultrasound review and maternal testing for Zika virus infection. Zika virus testing is recommended for \"1) infants with microcephaly or intracranial calcifications born to women who traveled to or reside in an area with Zika virus transmission while pregnant or 2) infants born to mothers with positive or inconclusive test results for Zika virus infection\" [85] . The CDC recommends additional health evaluation for infants with laboratory evidence of a possible congenital Zika virus infection. More comprehensive guidelines are available at the CDC website and in CDC releases. On 1st February, 2016, the World Health Organization declared Zika virus a Global Health Emergency. 8 On 3rd February, 2016 in the United States, Florida declares a health emergency after the identification of 5 patients with Zika virus infection On 5th February, 2016, Colombia's National Health Institute (INS) reported 3 deaths resulting from presumed Zika virus-associated Guillain-Barre syndrome. 9 On 5th February, 2016, the WHO declared 33 countries with autochthonous Zika virus infection and an additional 6 countries with local transmission. A total of 7 countries have now reported an increased incidence of microcephaly and/or Guillain-Barre syndrome. 10 Due to the rapid developments in the global Zika virus pandemic, new guidelines and recommendations are issued almost weekly, if not daily. The reader should be cognizant that the recommendations provided in the paragraphs above are only valid as of the date of submission of this manuscript. Updated recommendations are available from well known resources such as the WHO and the CDC, as well as local or regional health departments.",

After inactivation, the RNA load was 9.51 log copies/ ml, but the inactivated plasma was unable to render cell cultures infective. In addition, the inactivation procedure was able to decrease the production of replicative virus after a single passage, providing some guidance to be utilized for the discovery of antiviral drugs effective against Zika virus [109] .",

Methods to be utilized have to be environmentally safe but retain effectiveness. These include the use of insecticides in spray form and its use in areas considered optimal for breeding of mosquitoes such as stagnant water, ponds, and areas where rain water collects etc. The use of insect repellents such as DEET and the education of residents plays a major role in curbing mosquito populations. There are also efforts being made to introduce genetically resistant strains of mosquitoes. Ironically due to the mild nature of most Zika virus infections, the infection often goes undetected and those capable of spreading the disease may not appear clinically ill, and would be difficult to identify, which provides a challenge.",

Previously believed to be spread only by mosquitoes, thus the classification as an arbovirus, it is now known to be potentially transmissible by sexual contact or blood transfusion.

Since the skin is the entry point for Zika virus infection, immune dynamics in the skin clearly plays a role in viral entry and infection. As the Zika virus spreads, the need for a vaccine becomes increasingly urgent. A better understanding of the pathogenesis will facilitate development of an effective and safe vaccine. Other control measures must be implemented in the meantime, including vector control and prevention of mosquito bites. These control measures are outlined in Table 3 .",
