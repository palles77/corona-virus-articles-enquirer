Among these are zoonotic viruses that originate from reservoir species, often mammals, and jump to humans to cause disease syndromes of varying form and severity. An emerging virus, depending on its ability to transmit among humans, can lead to individual or a few sporadic cases, resulting in a localized outbreak that requires public health intervention or, in the worst scenarios, can develop into a large epidemic or global pandemic. Such emergence events over the past two decades are numerous and varied. They include viruses not previously encountered, such as the SARS and MERS coronaviruses [1] [2] [3] , and familiar foes that have reappeared to cause outbreaks, such as swine-and avian-origin influenza 4, 5 , and Ebola 6 and Zika 7 viruses. Although many outbreaks end naturally or are controlled quickly, questions remain over how best to scientifically respond to these events.",

These include what is the virus, is it novel, or does it represent the re-emergence of a known pathogen; what is its mode of transmission; where does the emerging virus come from (in particular, what is its reservoir host and/or geographic source); what ecological factors underpin its emergence; how many introductions into humans have there been; what is the timing of these introduction events, and was there a period of undetected transmission before the first reported case; during flare-ups and future outbreaks, how are they connected to previous events; and what is the nature of virus evolution and is there evidence for local adaptation? In the past, many of these of questions were addressed using case (incidence) data, which led to estimates of key epidemic parameters such as the basic reproductive number (R 0 , the expected number of secondary cases produced by each case at the start of the outbreak) that were used to inform epidemic control policy. Although still of fundamental importance, case data alone cannot inform public health management with the level of precision necessary for all targeted interventions. Recent advances in virus genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses, however, mean that we are now in a position to answer such questions with molecular precision, and open new areas of investigations not previously possible based on epidemiological data alone (Table 1) .",

Tracking the spread of infectious diseases to assist in their control has traditionally relied on the analysis of case data gathered as the outbreak proceeds.

We highlight the utility of this approach with the hypothetical outbreak of an unknown pathogen, 'Disease X', suggested by the World Health Organization to be a potential cause of a future major epidemic.

Patients may present with patterns of symptoms that are similar to those of more common diseases, but which, after repeated observation and diagnostic testing, may deviate in scale, seasonality or severity. At this very beginning of an outbreak, the most critical task is therefore to identify a causal pathogen. Historically, virus identification has been performed using molecular tools, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), that directly recognize pathogen-derived material (Box 2), or conventional non-molecular techniques, such as microscopy. The advent of untargeted metagenomic sequencing directly from clinical samples, however, means that we are now on the cusp of being able to detect human viruses in a single step, without a priori knowledge of putative causal pathogens (Box 2). The major advantage of sequencing-based approaches is the ability to detect novel viruses-such as the initial appearances of SARS 2 , MERS 3 or Lujo virus 23 -or unexpected ones, as exemplified by Ebola virus during the 2013-2016 epidemic in West Africa 24 .",

Its inclusion emphasizes the need for flexible and deployable platforms to understand and combat disease outbreaks of many varieties. Most likely, Disease X may be a known microorganism believed to cause no or mild human disease, as was the case for Zika virus before its epidemic in the Americas. Disease X could emerge anywhere in the world and, given the mobility of human populations, it could spread to distant and highly populated regions within days or weeks. To illustrate how genomic epidemiology can successfully reveal important aspects of disease emergence and inform epidemic control efforts, we present a hypothetical scenario in which Disease X successfully jumped into humans, established sustained transmission and caused severe disease. In Miami, Florida (United States), a 22-year-old man sought medical assistance after an influenza-like illness suddenly progressed to a dangerously high fever and laboured breathing. He reported golfing activity at nearby resorts, harbouring clusters of wildlife, including birds. He was admitted into the emergency room and within 3 days died of pneumonia. During this time, 5 other young adults presented with similar symptoms to Miamiarea hospitals. Standard molecular diagnostics for commonly suspected pathogens were negative, but immunoglobulin M antibodies collected from each patient were slightly cross-reactive to MERS and SARS coronaviruses. Since the virus could not be conclusively identified with conventional assays, metagenomic sequencing was used to identify Disease X as a novel human virus, most closely related to other coronaviruses in ducks (see figure, panel a). Importantly, due to the relatedness of the novel virus to a family of viruses with well-defined host-ranges, these data led to a hypothesis about its potential origin and reservoir (overwintering migratory birds in the nearby Everglades wetlands) and allowed for the development of virus-specific diagnostics and targeted sequencing approaches.",

In particular, coalescent models relate the rate at which virus lineages of a phylogenetic tree merge, as common ancestors, to the size of the epidemic.

As noted in the introduction, this can be assessed by estimating R 0 , which is critical for epidemiological projections and for planning public health responses. While R 0 can be calculated through epidemiological analyses of case counts, accurate estimates of such data may not be available early in an outbreak, since they require a time-series of cases. As demonstrated during the early spread of the novel influenza A/H1N1 virus in 2009, phylogenetic inference of epidemic growth based on virus genomics can provide estimates of R 0 comparable to that inferred from case data 36 . These calculations can be performed using coalescent models that directly estimate R 0 , based on classic susceptible-infectedrecovered (SIR) models 37, 38 . A similar group of models analyse patterns of lineage birth-death, linking the shape of trees to the rate at which virus lineages split and go extinct, and have recently gained popularity 39, 40 . Both approaches were applied during the 2013-2016 epidemic in West Africa to calculate R 0 to assess Ebola virus transmission dynamics, and illuminated the impact of 'superspreader' events 41, 42 . All of these methods, however, are beholden to the inherent uncertainty of genome sequence data, especially at the start of an epidemic where such sequences exhibit limited variability and sampling may be biased. Hence, phylogenetic estimates of R 0 , although probably indicative of broad characteristics such as epidemic growth, may not be precise enough to make critical decisions in the absence of corroborating (epidemiological) information.",

Although RNA viruses exhibit remarkably high evolutionary rates 53 , their small genome sizes and short epidemiological generation times often result in, on average, less than one substitution per transmission event [54] [55] [56] (Fig. 2b) . Hence, virus genomics alone often cannot be expected to perfectly reconstruct transmission chains at the level of individual infections. Combined with epidemiological data, however, virus genomics provides a powerful tool for restricting the number of possible transmission scenarios and for supporting novel modes of transmission 47, 57, 58 . In addition, most phylogeneticsbased transmission chain analyses have been performed using virus consensus sequences (that is, a single genome per sample/patient that represents the average of the virus population), which may limit resolution. However, as virus infections exhibit diverse intra-host populations (containing intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) 44 ), newer methods incorporating viral iSNVs may greatly increase the resolution of transmission chain analyses so long as multiple variants are transmitted between hosts 59 .",

Untargeted metagenomic sequencing provides a potential one-step solution for outbreak pathogen detection of both known and novel pathogens, and may be able to replace the need for multiple individual pathogen assays 24 . The main advantage of metagenomic sequencing is that it does not require a priori knowledge of the pathogen, but comes at the expense of specialized equipment, increased costs and bioinformatic complexity. Although high backgrounds of host nucleic acid and/or low pathogen titres in clinical samples can make pathogen detection difficult, host gene depletion 113 and pathogen enrichment 114, 115 methods can help alleviate these issues. After the first outbreak pathogen genome sequence has been obtained, targeted approaches using next-generation sequencing can also be developed. This was the case for both of the recent Zika and Ebola epidemics 116, 117 , where cheaper and faster amplicon-based approaches were rapidly developed and deployed to track both of the epidemics. The most common platforms used for these purposes are those developed by Illumina (for example, MiSeq and HiSeq), because they have high accuracy and throughput, but they also have high costs and relatively short read lengths (up to 300 base pairs). Cheaper portable devices, such as the miniaturized Oxford Nanopore MinION, can help to produce data in close to real time directly in-country and under austere conditions 93, 117 . This is a significant advancement because, along with open data sharing, rapid diagnostics and sequencing, such devices help promote a comprehensive and collaborative response network. the uncertainty of phylogeographic estimates, and to bear in mind that such analyses may only be capable of elucidating partial pictures of outbreak spread. In addition, sampling biases may severely affect these analyses, although the coalescent and birth-death models mentioned above have been extended to account for aspects of virus population structure [63] [64] [65] , making the analyses more robust to sampling heterogeneity 66 .",

To illustrate these methods, in Fig. 3 we show an application of generalized linear modelling to explain Ebola virus migration rates between locations as a function of several potential predictors, to infer virus spread during West African Ebola outbreak (Fig. 3) . In this case, geographic distances and population sizes at the location of origin and destination combine into a gravity model of spread, with virus transmission largely occurring within large population centres and geographic spread being more frequent over shorter distances 61 .

            "text": "Once outbreaks have been brought under control or (temporarily) resolved, phylogenetic analyses can provide insights into evolutionary patterns during inter-epidemic periods by comparing virus genome sequences sampled across different outbreaks. The most fundamental question is whether the virus in question has been able to persist in human populations between outbreaks, so that each new outbreak has arisen from an endemically circulating lineage (for example, dengue virus), or whether they represent independent zoonotic spillover events from an animal reservoir (for example, Ebola virus). With sufficient sampling of viruses from human and reservoir species, this question can be answered using standard phylogenetic analysis. For example, although both dengue virus and yellow fever virus have transmission cycles that involve mosquitoes and humans (urban transmission) or nonhuman primates (sylvatic transmission), phylogenetic analyses have shown that dengue virus is now an entirely endemic urban virus that does not rely on its sylvatic vectors and hosts to seed new epi demics 68 . Most human outbreaks of yellow fever, in contrast, have been shown by virus genomics approaches to represent independent The first three scenarios show a single introduction from a non-human reservoir followed by human-to-human spread. a, A small outbreak from a recent zoonosis with a commensurately short tree, suggesting recent emergence. R 0 is greater than 1, indicating the potential to cause a large outbreak. b, A medium-sized outbreak with a deeper tree and internal nodes dispersed. With R 0 close to 1, this suggests that emergence into humans was not recent and its transmission potential is just sufficient to persist. The root of the tree is not the index case meaning the zoonosis could be older. c, A large outbreak with R 0 greater than 1, and thus exhibiting exponential growth in case numbers. Distinctively for a growing epidemic, internal nodes tend to be towards the root of the tree, suggesting that only a small fraction of the total cases were sampled. d, A scenario of repeated zoonotic jumps with limited human to human transmission. The internal parts of the tree represent the diversity of the virus in the non-human reservoir and the human-to-human transmission cases are closely related. Icons courtesy of S. Knemeyer. emergences of the virus from sylvatic sources, rather than spread via an urban cycle 69, 70 .",

            "text": "Inter-epidemic analyses can also be used to elucidate the nature of virus evolution and spread in reservoir species, which are probably characterized by different evolutionary forces than those seen during human outbreaks 71, 72 . For example, although human outbreaks of Ebola have happened relatively frequently since the 1970s, each outbreak starts as an independent spillover of the virus from an animal (probably bat 73 ) reservoir. Hence, the inter-epidemic evolution of Ebola virus occurs in a species other than humans, such that patterns of genetic divergence among the viruses associated with human epidemics can provide insight into viral replication and transmission within reservoir hosts. For example, there have been suggestions that Ebola virus has spread across Africa in a wave-like manner in its reservoir species 74 ; however, phylogenetic analyses incorporating virus genomic data from recent outbreaks are incompatible with this scenario 6 . Additionally, while Ebola virus normally evolves according to a relatively constant molecular clock 6,45,75-77 , the phylogenetic branch leading to the viruses sequenced from the small Ebola outbreak that occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2014, concurrent with the 2013-2016 epidemic in West Africa, was characterized by a far lower evolutionary rate 78 . Although the reasons for this reduction in evolutionary tempo are unclear, it is possible that it reflects Ebola virus evolution in a different (unknown) reservoir species that experiences a lower rate of viral replication. Alternatively, this rate disparity may result from the existence of different viral replication states within the same reservoir host, similar to that described during human epidemics, with faster rates observed during continuous human-tohuman transmission and slower rates during persistent infections of Ebola survivors 79 .",

The foremost need for genomic epidemiology is timely access to clinical samples and data, which should be built on productive and equitable collaborations with local communities, public health agencies, outbreak responders, local clinics and researchers 80 . For each clinical sample to be used for virus genomic sequencing, it is essential to obtain a minimal set of metadata related to the infection, including: (1) the date of sample collection and/or onset of symptoms; and (2) the location of sampling. Additional information can greatly increase the utility of genomic epidemiology, including the availability of: (3) travel and contact history; (4) suspected source of infection; and (5) clinical outcome and symptoms. Other factors, including patient history, age, sex and economic status can also help to reveal risk factors underlying infection and transmission.

Consequently, there is an urgent need to make genomic and epidemiological data and analysis tools publically available during ongoing epidemics 81 . This movement is supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), which has called for data pertaining to public health emergencies to be disseminated openly and immediately following generation, and not withheld until the acceptance or publication of a corresponding scientific paper 82 . More recently, the WHO has outlined the current and future benefits of virus genome data sharing during outbreaks 83 . Combined with an acceleration of making manuscripts available via preprint servers such as arXiv and bioRxiv, especially during outbreaks 84 , there has been a shift towards scientists storing their data and source code on depositories such as GitHub (https://www. github.com), Synapse (https://www.synapse.org) and Data Dryad (https://www.datadryad.org), in close to real-time for others to use. Furthermore, extensive online communities and forums such as Twitter (https://www.twitter.com), Virological (http://virological. org), FluTrackers (https://www.flutrackers.com), ProMED (https:// www.promedmail.org), Nextstrain (https://www.nextstrain.org), HealthMap (https://www.healthmap.org) and Microreact (https:// www.microreact.org) allow rapid dissemination of unpublished results and analyses. In our experience, not only does the process of open science promote new collaborations and lead to more accurate scientific insights into outbreak research, but it helps in getting relevant information rapidly into the hands of decision makers.

The accumulated set of these data-together with the rapid development of sophisticated software packages (http://virological.org/c/software)-will provide a valuable resolve for the mitigation and control of future outbreaks. Ultimately, with sufficient genome sequences from individual viral genera and/or families, it may be possible to categorize viruses by their phylogenetic patterns and utilize this information in epidemic preparedness. For example, as well as considering obvious biological features of viruses such as their genome structure and mode of transmission, it may be possible to group viruses according to a series of evolutionary variables such as rate of evolutionary change, extent of antigenic evolution, frequency of recombination, pattern of geographic spread and population dynamics. This information may then help forecast the evolutionary behaviour of any virus, should it re-emerge in human populations, and assist in the selection of future vaccine strains [86] [87] [88] . This information will also help counter the alarmist claims that emerging viruses will evolve novel phenotypes, such as airborne transmission in the case of Ebola virus 89 , that often accompany any major disease outbreak. It is clear, however, that a more fundamental understanding of the genetic and ecological barriers of virus spillover into human populations is needed to better identify risk factors for disease emergence. Longterm capacity building, partnerships with local communities, and commitments to long-term investments on these fronts will go a long way towards better enabling the global community to effectively and rapidly deal with future emerging outbreaks 80 . Geographic distances between all pairs of locations, in this case administrative areas in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, as well as population sizes at the origin and destination of these pairs are combined into a transition rate matrix through a generalized linear model. This matrix parameterizes the phylogenetic process of spread that is being estimated. Each predictor is associated with a coefficient, \u03b2 , which denotes the strength of contribution with some predictors (for example, population size) positively associated with the intensity of migration whereas others (for example, geographic distance) are negatively associated. A coefficient of 0 implies that the predictor is excluded from the model (represented in the figure by the transparent matrix with \u03b2 = 0).",

The three main hypotheses and their expected genomic signatures are illustrated here with a hypothetical haplotype network. Genomes from all of the observed flare-ups grouped closely with genomes sequenced from patients in the same country, from earlier in the outbreak (bottom left), consistent with transmission from persistent sources. In contrast, genomes linked to re-introductions from neighbouring countries (right) would be expected to cluster with genomes from a different country and from late in the outbreak. In the case of independent spillovers from a reservoir host (top left, that is, independent sampling from the diversity circulating within the reservoir), the spillover genomes would be linked to the main outbreak by a long branch originating from near the root of the network. GIN, Guinea; LBR, Liberia; SLE, Sierra Leone. b, Expected 'genomic resolution' for the inference of transmission chains at the level of individual infections. Resolution is dependent on the serial interval between infections (x-axis; used as a proxy for epidemiological generation time), as well as the genome size and nucleotide substitution rate (y-axis).
