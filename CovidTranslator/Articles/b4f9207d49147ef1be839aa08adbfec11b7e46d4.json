            "text": "To subvert host antiviral immune responses, many viruses have evolved countermeasures to inhibit IFN signaling pathway. Porcine bocavirus (PBoV), a newly identified porcine parvovirus, has received attention because it shows clinically high co-infection prevalence with other pathogens in postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PWMS) and diarrheic piglets. In this study, we screened the structural and non-structural proteins encoded by PBoV and found that the non-structural protein NP1 significantly suppressed IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) activity and subsequent IFNstimulated gene (ISG) expression. However, NP1 affected neither the activation and translocation of STAT1/STAT2, nor the formation of the heterotrimeric transcription factor complex ISGF3 (STAT1/STAT2/ IRF9). Detailed analysis demonstrated that PBoV NP1 blocked the ISGF3 DNA-binding activity by combining with the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of IRF9. In summary, these results indicate that PBoV NP1 interferes with type I IFN signaling pathway by blocking DNA binding of ISGF3 to attenuate innate immune responses.",

Type I interferons (IFNs), including IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, represents the principal response of the innate immune system to virus invasion (Gonzalez-Navajas et al., 2012) . During viral infection, host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize viral components or replication intermediates, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and trigger signals that result in the expression of type I IFNs (Rathinam and Fitzgerald, 2011) . Following binding of the IFN receptor complex, the synthesis and secretion of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 initiates signaling through the Janus kinases/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway (O'Sullivan et al., 2007) , resulting in the phosphorylation of STATs (Leonard and O'Shea, 1998; Pellegrini and Dusanter-Fourt, 1997) . The phosphorylated STATs interact with the transcription factor IRF9 to form the heterotrimeric transcription factor complex, IFNstimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). This complex translocates to the nucleus where it binds specific regulatory DNA sequences called IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) via IRF9 (Qureshi et al., 1995; Veals et al., 1993) . This binding step drives the transcription of many IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) involved in antiviral states, such as double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), 2 0 ,5 0oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx1), ISG15, ISG56 and ISG56 (Borden et al., 2007; Fu et al., 1990) .",

            "text": "Porcine Bocavirus (PBoV), a newly emergent parvovirus belonging to the genus bocavirus of the parvovirinae subfamily, was first identified in Swedish pigs with post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) (Allander et al., 2005; Blomstrom et al., 2009; Chen et al., 1986; Manteufel and Truyen, 2008) . To date, a number of different strains of PBoV have been reported worldwide in PMWS, respiratory, diarrheic or asymptomatic swine (Blomstrom et al., 2009;  Huang et al., 2014; Zhai et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2014 Zhang et al., , 2013 . Although the pathogenesis of PBoV infection remains to be clarified, there is a significantly higher prevalence of co-infection with Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), PRRSV, Porcine torque teno virus (PTTV), and classical Swine fever virus (CSFV) in PBoV-positive pigs, indicating that PBoV plays a role in the co-infection process Zhai et al., 2010) . Moreover, high prevalence of PBoV was detected in inguinal lymph node and spleen tissues in PBoV-positive pigs . Hence, it is speculated that PBoV is an immunosuppressive pathogen (Zhou et al., 2014) . The full-length genome sequence of PBoV exceeds 5 kb and contains three potential open reading frames (ORFs) encoding two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NP1) and two structural proteins (VP1 and VP2). The genome organization is very similar to that of other bocavirus Qiu et al., 2007) . Despite extensive efforts, isolation of PBoV and the generation of an infectious clone have not yet been successful. To explore the possible mechanism (s) underlying the immunosuppressive effects of PBoV, we have focused on the effects of PBoV-encoded proteins on innate immunity. Recent study demonstrated that human bocavirus (HBoV) NP1 inhibits both Sendai virus-and poly(dA-dT)-induced IFN-\u03b2 production (Zhang et al., 2012) . We also found that PBoV NP1 could inhibit Sendai virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 production (unpublished data). In this study, we demonstrated that, in addition to inhibiting IFN-\u03b2 production, PBoV NP1 also antagonize IFN signaling by reducing the DNA-binding activity of ISGF3, exhibiting a broad-spectrum ability to inhibit innate immune responses.",

            "text": "It is well-known that IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 initiates a series of signaling cascades through the JAK/STAT pathway, resulting in the expression of a set of ISGs, which collaboratively suppress the replication of viruses and contribute to the development of adaptive immune responses (Platanias, 2005) . PBoV encodes two structural proteins (VP1, VP2) and two non-structural proteins (NS1, NP1). To identify whether these proteins influences type I IFN signaling, we examined the effects of PBoV encoding proteins expression on ISG promoter activity in response to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 stimulation. To this end, HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with ISRE-Luc (containing a consensus sequence for the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) of the ISG promoter), pRL-TK (internal control plasmid) and the different PBoV protein expression vectors (VP1, VP2, NS1, NP1). Empty expression vectors were used as controls. At 24-h posttransfection, the cells were treated with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2, ISRE-Luc was measured in whole-cell extracts using a dual luciferase reporter assay at 6 h after this treatment. As shown in Fig. 1A and B, the activation of ISRE promoter was markedly induced by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 stimulation, while this induction was strongly impaired by NP1 ( Fig. 1A and B) . Conversely, overexpression of VP1 and VP2 enhanced the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-induced ISRE activation. Using real-time RT-PCR, we also analyzed the expression of several ISGs at the mRNA level in cells overexpressing NP1. As expected, ectopic expression of NP1 significantly reduced the expression of ISG15, ISG54 and ISG56 mRNA induced by IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. 1C) . These data indicated that PBoV NP1 functions as an antagonist of IFN signaling.",

Therefore, we investigated whether NP1 inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT1 or STAT2. To this end, HEK-293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS-HA-NP1 and then incubated with IFN-\u03b1. The results showed that phosphorylation of STAT1 (P-Y701-STAT1) and STAT2 (P-Y690-STAT2) were obviously induced by IFN-\u03b1 in cells with or without NP1 expression ( Fig. 2A) . Similarly, the endogenous expression of STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 was also maintained at a steady-state level in the presence or absence of NP1 ( Fig. 2A) . These observations indicated that NP1 did not prevent STATs phosphorylation or induce the degradation of STATs and IRF9.",

By using a reporter assay, we found that the IRF9 expression up-regulated ISRE activity and NP1 suppressed IRF9-induced ISRE activation. However, possibly due to a lack of the active form, non-phosphorylated STAT1 or STAT2 expression did not have any effect on ISRE activity (data not shown), indicating that NP1 targets at or downstream of the ISGF3 complex. It is known that essential contacts between IRF9 and STAT1 are required for ISGF3 stability and transcriptional activity (Horvath et al., 1996) . As previously described, the human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) IE1 protein disrupted ISGF3 complex formation and inhibited its binding to the ISRE by binding STAT2 within the 111-397 region (Jaworska et al., 2010) . To address this issue, we used CoIP assays to determine whether NP1 alters ISGF3 complex formation. Constructs encoding Flag-tagged STAT1, STAT2, IRF9, or empty vector plasmid were co-transfected into HEK-293T cells with HA-tagged NP1 or empty vector. The transfected cells were stimulated with IFN-\u03b1 for 6 h before lysates were prepared for immunoprecipitation with an anti-IRF9 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A , Flag-IRF9 co-precipitated with Flag-STAT1 and Flag-STAT2, demonstrating that the Flag-tagged protein formed an ISGF3 complex after IFN treatment. This co-precipitation was not impaired by NP1 expression (Fig. 3A) . Interestingly, the HAtagged NP1 and ISGF3 complex were immunoprecipitated with the anti-IRF9 antibody (Fig. 3A) , suggesting that NP1 interacts with the ISGF3 complex but does not impair its formation.",

As mentioned above, the PBoV NP1 protein binds IRF9 and blocks the binding of IRF9 to responsive DNA sequences within the promoter ( Fig. 3A and Fig. 4A ). These observations indicated that this inhibition may involve in the IRF9 DBD. To confirm this speculation, we investigated the capacity of NP1 to interact with the IRF9 DBD. The Nterminal mutant containing the DBD region (IRF9-1-199) was constructed and the results of Co-IP assay showed that NP1 bound to the IRF9 DBD (Fig. 4B) .",

Knowing the structure loop 1 (L1) and \u03b1-helix 3 (\u03b13) of the IRFs DBD play important role in DNA binding, it is possible that PBoV NP1 blocks this binding surface to inhibit IRF9 binding activity. Although the crystal structure of the IRF9/ DNA complex has not yet been resolved, a Histidine (H) residue on L1 and a Arginine (R) residue on \u03b13 are completely conserved in the IRF family, and which were identified as an important DNA recognition sites in IRF2, IRF3 and IRF7 (Escalante et al., 2007; Fujii et al., 1999) . Thus, we speculated that H44 on L1 and R85 on \u03b13 of IRF9 perform binding function in IRF9/DNAassociation. To investigate whether the binding surface of IRF9 is required for interaction with NP1, we used two constructs by incorporating mutations in Loop1 or \u03b1-helix 3 of the IRF9 DBD in Co-IP assays (Fig. 4C ). As shown in Fig. 4D , compared with the wild-type controls, less NP1 was co-immunoprecipitated with IRF9-1-199-H44A, suggesting that the conserved Histidine residue contributes to NP1 binding. However, similar amounts of NP1 were immunoprecipitated with IRF9-1-199-R85A and the wild-type IRF9-1-199 control (Fig. 4D) , possibly because Arginine 85 of IRF9 is not required for DNA binding. Taken together, these data further demonstrate a mechanism by which PBoV NP1 disrupts the IFN signaling pathway by interaction with the DNA-binding domain of IRF9.",

To subvert the antiviral effects of IFN-induced ISGs, viruses were shown to express certain proteins that negatively regulate type I IFN signaling by targeting the JAK-STAT pathway at different levels, including impeding IFN receptor activation (Bisson et al., 2009) , degrading STATs (Tay et al., 2013; Ulane and Horvath, 2002) , inhibiting STATs phosphorylation (Caignard et al., 2007; Devaux et al., 2007) , blocking STAT1/STAT2 nuclear translocation Xu et al., 2014) , and disturbing ISGF3 formation (Jaworska et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2006) . In this study, we screened the components of JAK-STAT pathway and found that PBoV NP1 does not affect the amounts of STATs and IRF9 in IFN-\u03b1-treated cells, nor does it alter the IFN-induced phosphorylation of STAT1/STAT2. Furthermore, NP1 hardly affected the nuclear translocation of STATs. Interestingly, we found NP1 interacted with ISGF3 without any effect on its formation but inhibited ISGF3 DNAbinding activity. Thus, we identified PBoV NP1 as an antagonist of the type I IFN system to mediate negative regulation of IFN signaling by targeting the DNA-binding step of ISGF3. Because we did not investigate the potential interaction of NP1 with CREB-binding protein (CBP) in the present study, we could not exclude the possibility that NP1 may impair CBP function. Given that binding of transcription factors to promoters and combining with CBP are two independent events, we mainly focused on the mechanism by which the DNA-binding of ISGF3 is inhibited.",

            "text": "Acting as key transcription factors in the IFN signaling pathway, the activated ISGF3 recognize and bind directly to the conserved DNA sequences in the nucleus. Multiple levels of regulation occur during ISGF3 translocation to the nucleus. However, to the best of our knowledge, only the rabies virus P protein has been shown to inhibit ISGF3 binding to the ISRE directly, whereas it also blocks STAT1 nuclear translocation (Vidy et al., 2007) . It is unclear at present how the PBoV NP1 protein inhibits the binding of ISGF3 to the DNA. We speculate that there are two possibilities: 1) NP1 interacts directly with the IRF9 DBD to block the binding step; 2) NP1 interacts directly with the promoter to block the binding site on ISRE. In this study, we confirmed that NP1 interacts with IRF9 DBD. This result is consistent with a previous report (Zhang et al., 2012) , which described the interaction of the HBoV NP1 protein with the IRF3 DBD. Furthermore, we noted that a potential DNA binding site (H44) on Loop1 of IRF9 contributes to IRF9 and NP1 association, indicating that NP1 acts as an obstruction on the DNA-binding interface of IRF9, and in turn interferes with the IRF9 DNA-binding activity. Considering the structural similarity among the different IRF DBDs and the histidine residue on Loop1 is also highly conserved in IRFs family, it is possible that NP1 interacts with similar binding sites on the DBDs of other IRFs to mediate broad-spectrum impairment of the IFN system. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that NP1 interacts directly with the responsive DNA-binding site of the promoter. Indeed, as previously shown, the KSHV K-bZIP protein, which is an IFN antagonist, interacts directly with the PRDIII-I region of IFN-\u03b2 and the ISRE region of RANTES (Lefort et al., 2007) . Considering that bocavirus NP1 has effects on RNA processing and DNA replication (Sukhu et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2009) and the existence of a potential nucleic acid recognition site at the Nterminal region of PBoV NP1 (http:// http://smart.embl-heidelberg. de/; http://pfam.xfam.org), it is possible that PBoV NP1 recognizes and binds to the DNA sequence on the promoter.",

HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with ISRE-Luc, pRL-TK, and HA-tagged NS1, NP1, VP1 or VP2 expression plasmids. Twenty-four hours after the initial transfection, the cells were treated with IFN\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2. Dual luciferase assays were performed after treatment. The resultant ratios were normalized to fold change values with reference to the untreated empty vector control. The results represent the means and standard deviations of data from three independent experiments. (C) Overexpression of NP1 inhibited IFN-\u03b1 induced transcription of ISG15, ISG54 and ISG56. HEK-293T cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with 1 \u03bcg of a plasmid encoding PBoV NP1 protein (pCAGGS-HA-NP1) or an empty vector. At 24-h post-transfection, the cells were treated with IFN-\u03b1 and the cells were collected after a further 6 h. Total RNA was extracted from the cells, and the expression levels of the ISG15, ISG54 and ISG56, and GAPDH genes were evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The results are expressed as increases in mRNA levels relative to those in transfected cells without IFN infection and were normalized to the expression level of the GAPDH housekeeping gene. One of three experiments is shown. * P o 0.05, ** Po 0.01, Student's t-test.",
