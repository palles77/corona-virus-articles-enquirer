            "text": "Currently available prognostic tools are inadequate to discern the molecular basis of the heterogenic response in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients treated with the current standard of therapy. The expression and biological function of immune mediators have been shown to be critical in all phases of the immune response to HCV infection and likely therefore influence host response. Herein, a biometric multiplex serum cytokine assay was utilized to characterize the immunomodulatory effects of host response in 10 HCV patients. Serum levels of 17 cytokines were compared before and after 1 month of treatment and against controls. Overall serum cytokine levels were significantly higher in patients (P < 0.05) than controls. Additionally, viral titers decreased in all patients after 1 month of therapy, as did overall serum cytokine levels in the cohort (P < 0.05). To assess relationships between changes in cytokine levels and changes in viral titer, the cohort was divided into three statistically distinct subgroups based on changes in viral titers. Specific sets of cytokines decreased in each group: decreases in CCL4, interleukin (IL)-2, CXCL8, and IL-1\u03b2 correlated with the greatest drops in viral titer, decreases in IL-5, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and CCL4 correlated with moderate drops in viral titer, and only CCL2 correlated with the lowest drops in viral titer. Interestingly, decreases in CCL4 levels correlated with decreases in viral titers in all patients. CCL4 controls leukocyte influx and thus propagates inflammation. In conclusion, these data raise the possibility that characteristic changes in host response modulate the therapeutic response, demonstrating the prognostic power of serum cytokine profiling in chronic HCV.",

The current therapy for HCV infection includes pegylated interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 plus ribavirin; the sustained virological response (SVR) rates with this combination therapy were improved to more than 40%, compared to less than 20% with IFN-\u03b1 monotherapy (8, 9) . Patients infected with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 have been estimated to be curable at a rate of approximately 80% with this combination, whereas pegylated IFN-\u03b1-2b and ribavirin combination therapy helped achieve SVR rates of up to 72% in HCV relapsers after treatment for 48 weeks (10) (11) (12) .",

Cytokines are critical in all phases of the immune response to HCV infection, from early onset of liver damage to chronic infection, viral persistence, tissue damage, and fibrosis. The immune response in HCV is mediated with a predominantly Th2/Th0 response in the periphery (16, 17) and a Th1 response in the liver (18) . Elevated serum levels of Th2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and IL-2 have been observed in chronic HCV patients (19) . Cytokines produced by both CD4+ and CD8+ cells play an important role in both inhibiting viral replication and causing liver injury. Macrokine (WF10), a novel macrophage-regulating agent, has been shown to downregulate elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2) in a dose-dependent fashion in nonresponsive patients with HCV infection (20) .

The intricate complexity of both cytokine networks clearly conceals the role that a single cytokine may play in the pathogenesis of the disease. It is therefore informative to investigate the immunopathogenesis of the disease process by analyzing multiple cytokines. Utilizing a broadspectrum bead-based multiplex immunoassay, we have effectively characterized the serum levels of cytokines that mediate humoral and cellular immunity and inflammation, correlated these serum cytokine levels with disease activity, and characterized the immunomodulatory effects of therapy 1 month posttreatment. This has provided us with a better understanding of the role of cellular, humoral, and chemotactic immunity at a critical time in the treatment course of HCV infection, when the most significant changes in viral titer are observed.",

A multiplex biometric enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based immunoassay, containing dyed microspheres conjugated with a monoclonal antibody specific for a target protein, was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bioplex Human Cytokine Assay; BioRad Inc., Hercules, CA). Cytokines measured were IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, CXCL8 (IL-8), IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-17, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractive protein [MCP]-1), CCL4 (macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]-1\u03b2), and TNF-\u03b1. Briefly, serum samples were diluted 1:4 and incubated with antibody-coupled beads. Complexes were washed, then incubated with biotinylated detection antibody and, finally, with streptavidin-phycoerythrin prior to assessing cytokine concentration titers. Concentrated human recombinant cytokine was provided by the vendor (BioRad, Inc.). A broad range, 1.95 \u221232,000 pg/ml, of standards was used to establish standard curves to maximize the sensitivity and dynamic range of the assay. Cytokine levels were determined using a Bio-Plex array reader (an automated flow-based microfluidics device that uses a dual-laser fluorescent detector with real-time digital signal processing for quantitation; Luminex, Austin, TX). This instrument quantitates multiplex immunoassays in a 96-well format on very small fluid volumes. The concentrations of analytes in these assays were calculated using a standard curve with software provided by the manufacturer. A regression analysis was performed to derive an equation that was then used to predict the concentration of cytokines in serum samples. Statisical Analysis. Patients were clustered into three groups (low-, moderate-, and high-responsive groups) based on the similarity of quantitative change in viral titer at 1 month, using Student's t-test as a measure of significance. Change in viral titer was calculated as (pretreatment viral titer)-(viral titer at 1 month). Nonparametric variables were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.",

Liver biopsies and peripheral blood samples were obtained prior to therapy and blood samples were collected at 1 month following therapy for viral testing and assessment of clinical parameters (Table 1 ). Viral subtyping demonstrated that four different HCV subtypes were present within this cohort: subtypes 1a, 1b, 2, and 3a. Viral titers in peripheral blood samples were estimated by quantitative PCR. Viral titers decreased in all patients after 1 month of combined therapy highlighting the efficacy of this treatment modality (Table 1, Figure 1A ). Titers dropped below detectable levels in four patients, depicting a complete remission. In the remaining patients the response to therapy was variable (Table 1, Figure 1A ).

Also of note, not all individuals in the high-response group had undetectable levels of virus at 1 month, but they had in common the highest quantitative drop in viral titer at 1 month.

However, treatment remains a challenge, particularly for certain patient populations, because several virus-related and individual patient-related factors are associated with a poor therapeutic response. Ten adult patients with HCV infection were followed prospectively over 4 weeks during combination therapy with pegylated IFN and ribavirin. Significant changes in viral titer were observed in the majority of patients after 1 month of treatment, with no virus detected in 40% of patients and a greater than 10-fold decrease in viral titer observed in the remaining patients, illustrating the significance of this phase of therapy with regard to modulation of infection. Interestingly, five of the six partially responsive patients were infected with genotype 1 HCV, further confirming previous findings of lower response rates in patients with this viral genotype (28) (29) (30) and demonstrating the complexity of therapeutic outcome. Importantly, cirrhosis is projected to occur in 10%-20% of patients in whom chronic infection persists (6, 7) . Defining the bases of nonresponse is therefore crucial for defining more efficacious treatments. Host response plays a key role in response to virus. The expression and biological function of cytokines are therefore critical in defining host response, as these mediators are principal regulators of the immune response. To assess the role of host response in therapeutic outcome, we used a multiplex cytokine immunoassay to measure the therapy-induced changes among 17 serum cytokines from this cohort. Serum cytokine levels were assessed in patients prior to initiation of therapy and posttherapy.",

HCV has been shown to have the potential to induce autoimmune disease including inflammatory arthritis and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (31) (32) (33) (34) . The relatively high cytokine levels and the persistence of significant arthralgic and myalgic symptoms in the absence of detectable virus may suggest the need for anti-inflammatory therapy in this patient. While diagnostic biochemical analyses failed to identify a likely cause of the musculoskeletal symptoms, serum cytokine profiling provided a likely biochemical basis and evidence for the systemic inflammatory symptoms, demonstrating a utility of cytokine profiling as a screening tool. In the remaining nine patients serum cytokine levels measured prior to therapy were significantly higher than those observed in the control population (P < 0.05). After 1 month of therapy, overall serum cytokine levels decreased in these patients (P < 0.05). In group C, the group with the most significant drop in viral titer (high-responsive group), significant decreases were observed in the levels of CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2), IL-2, CXCL8 (IL-8), and IL-1\u03b2 after 1 month of combination therapy. Patients with moderate drops in viral titer in response to therapy (group B) had significantly decreased levels in only three cytokines, IL-5, G-CSF, and CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2) while in weakly responsive patients (group A), only CCL2 (MCP-1) significantly decreased posttreatment. It was therefore demonstrated that patients can be further differentiated by their immune responses and these differences categorically correlate with therapeutic response.",

Decreased serum CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2) levels were observed after 1 month of therapy in all high and moderate responders. However, serum CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2) levels remained unchanged or were increased in patients with the weakest response to therapy (group A; specifically patients P1 and P2). The association between a drop in CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2) levels at 1 month and response to virus at 1 month may be of prognostic merit, as a drop in CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2) levels at 1 month also correlates with response at end of treatment (100%) and SVR (87.5%).",

Because these CCR5 ligands are constitutively expressed on portal vessels, they provide a mechanism for the recruitment of CCR5 memory T cells to portal areas in normal liver during immune surveillance, as well as for recruiting T cells to portal areas in inflammatory liver diseases. CCR5 has preferential activity for Th1 lymphocytes (36) , triggering the activation of IL-2 and IL-1\u03b2. Furthermore, liver injury mediated by CD8 + T cells in graft-versus-host disease is CCR5-dependent (37) . The decrease in serum levels of CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2) and CXCL8 (IL-8) posttreatment suggests that a decrease in the transendothelial migration of leukocytes occurs in responsive patients, which would preclude the retention and the survival of lymphocytes in the liver and, thereby, ameliorate tissue damage and fibrosis. Accordingly, concomitant decreases in CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2) and the Th1 cytokines IL-2 and IL-1\u03b2 ere observed in patients with the highest response rates, which would be expected given the predominantly Th1 immune response in the liver HCV patients (19) . Intracellular immunity, influenced by IFN-\u03b3 is imperative for defense against viral infections. CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2) mediated T cell infiltration is essential for the delivery of IFN-\u03b3 to mediate downstream protective responses against HCV infection in the liver. It has been shown recently from intrahepatic gene expression profiles of chimpanzees that MIP-1\u03b2 was upregulated in acute infection at the time of viral clearance, but not in those who failed to eradicate the virus (38) , and previous studies have demonstrated that HCV-infected individuals have a diminished response to CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2) in the liver (39) . These data and the fact that serum CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2) levels correlated with therapeutic response in these nine patients suggest that the action of CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2) part influences an appropriate treatment-induced host response to HCV.",

This somewhat antithetical conjecture is consistent with recent observations that mortality in SARS virus infection is due in part to the Th1-biased inflammation induced in lungs by the virus and the fact that mortality can be decreased by treating SARS patients with a combined course of immunosuppressants (corticosteroids) and antivirals (ribavirin) late in the infection cycle at a time when the host response is causing maximal damage to the infected tissue (40) . If this provocative hypotheses is valid, then treating nonresponsive HCV patients with a combination of immunosuppressants and antivirals may improve response rates and targeted anti-CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2) therapy could be of interest in future clinical trials.",
