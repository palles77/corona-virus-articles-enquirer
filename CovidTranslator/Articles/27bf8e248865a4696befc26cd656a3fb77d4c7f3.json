Pharmaceutical planning was considerably more advanced in the MMRS counties. Hospitals in these counties were more likely to have dedicated decontamination facilities and to have conducted a disaster exercise using the decontamination facility. Agreements with other health care facilities to accept patients were more likely to be in place, and, as expected, regional planning was more advanced in the MMRS counties. Mean scores on the 6 composite measures were compared for hospitals in Fayette and Jefferson counties and facilities in all other counties. Hospitals in the MMRS counties scored significantly higher on the measures for pharmaceutical management (P < .001) and preparation for being out of communication or cut off from resources (P < .001).",

Overall, the results suggest that much work remains to be done. Hospital WMD preparedness planning and coordination on a community or regional basis were in early stages of development at the time of this survey, and some critical hospital response capabilities, such as isolation, decontamination, and syndromic surveillance were clearly underdeveloped. These results are generally consistent with those of a national survey of 2021 short-term, nonfederal, general hospitals in metropolitan statistical areas conducted by the US General Accounting Office (GAO) between May and September 2002. The GAO found that most hospitals reported participating in basic planning and coordination activities for bioterrorism response, but many lacked the medical equipment to handle the number of patients that would likely result from a bioterrorist incident. 2 The MMRS program appears to be producing positive results as evidenced by the comparison of MMRS and non-MMRS counties in Kentucky. Most encouragingly, hospitals in MMRS counties reported more advanced pharmaceutical planning and preparedness, an area of critical importance in a bioterrorism event. However, the need for greater support for preparedness efforts in non-MMRS counties was evident in the large variations across EMAs and low scores on the composite measure of pharmaceutical planning.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to this study. First, the results cannot be generalized nationally because only hospitals in Kentucky participated. Second, the 2 surveys extended over 7 months at a time when hospitals were busily engaged in preparedness activities. Thus, it seems likely that early respondents continued to improve during the study period, and these improvements are not reflected in the results. However, much of the delay was caused by the need to clarify responses to questions in the supplemental survey, and the GAO survey also extended over a prolonged time period (4 months). 2 In addition, repeated calls from KHA staff resulted in a remarkably high response rate, although this process extended the duration of the survey. Third, Kentucky hospitals have continued to improve preparedness and response capabilities since this survey was completed. It is likely that hospitals are better prepared today in a number of areas, both because of increased investment and training related to bioterrorism readiness and in response to concerns raised by the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Almost $1.8 million in federal funds have been provided to hospitals in the Commonwealth, and some hospitals purchased decontamination equipment and PPE with these funds. However, Kentucky hospitals had already spent almost $1.7 million of their own revenues to improve preparedness, and respondents identified more than $18 million in high priority needs. Thus, in Kentucky as elsewhere, the burden of preparing for catastrophic terrorism is largely an unfunded mandate for hospitals.",

The Institute of Medicine has recommended a comprehensive evaluation process for this program and noted several limitations of checklisttype questionnaires for evaluating complex programs, such as the MMRS. 7 Overall, the surveys described above provided a valuable input to regional and state-level preparedness planning. Comments from hospital CEOs suggest that responding to the survey based on the Mass Casualty Disaster Plan Checklist provided a useful educational experience for them and their staff, as well as helping improve emergency plans. As preparedness efforts continue, these or similar instruments could be administered periodically to assess the progress of hospital preparedness planning.",
