            "text": "The spread of the COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been growing since its first identification in December 2019. The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor via which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. By calculating : bioRxiv preprint 2 the binding energy between RBD and ACE2, we highlighted the putative jump in the affinity from a progenitor form of SARS-CoV-2 to the current virus responsible for COVID-19 outbreak. Our result was consistent with the phylogeny analysis and corroborates the opinion that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than mutation accumulation. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to hACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Moreover, we show from the structural analysis that it is unlikely for the interface residues to be the result of human engineering. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2.",

The use of RBD sequences, however, places the virus in a clade that comprises SARS-CoV related homologs including isolates from Bat and Civet. The clade swapping as seen in figure 1A , seems also to occur for RaTG13 and Rm1 isolated from bat. This is expected as the use of different phylogenetic markers may considerably affect the topology of the tree. However, given the functional implication of the spike RBD in host-pathogen infection, we have raised the question about where the virus obtained its RBD binding interface. The binding of the spike glycoprotein to ACE2 receptor requires a certain level of affinity. In the case where the RBD evolves from an ancestral form closer to that of Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21, we expected a decrease of the binding energy through the evolution process following incremental changes in the RBD. In such a scenario, we presume that there are other intermediary forms of coronavirus that describe such variation of the binding energy to reach a level where the pathogen can cross the species barriers and infect .

On the other hand, our results show that the binding energy and the interface sequence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD are closer to SARS-CoV related isolates (either from Human or other species). Therefore a recombination event involving the spike protein that might have occurred between SARS-CoV and an ancestral form of the current SARS-CoV-2 virus might be also possible. This will allow for the virus to acquire a minimum set of residues for the interaction with hACE2. The recombination in the spike protein gene has been previously suggested by Wei et al in their phylogenetic analysis [4] . Thereafter, incremental changes in the binding interface segment will occur in order to reach a better affinity toward the receptor. One of these changes may involve P499 residue which substitution to threonine seems to drastically destabilize the interface segment and has a distant effect. Moreover, the decomposition of the interaction energy showed that 5 out of 6 hotspot amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 have their equivalent in SARS-CoV including N501. Contrary to what Wan et al [17] have stated, the single mutation N501T does not seem to enhance the affinity. Rather, the residue Q493 might be responsible for such higher affinity due to a better satisfaction of the Van der Waals by the longer polar side chain of asparagine. Indeed, when we made the same analysis while mutating Q493 to N493, the favorable contribution decreases from -2.55 kcal/mol to a non significant value of -0.01 kcal/mol, thus supporting our claim.",

            "text": "No major divergence of the interaction interface of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with hACE2 was noticed from the similarity matrix analysis. This suggests that the molecular elements required for the binding with the receptor might also be involved in the interaction with other orthologous forms of ACE2 and that these elements are not optimized specifically for the human form. Therefore, it is unlikely that the interface of RBD from SARS-CoV-2 is a result of human intervention aiming to increase the affinity toward ACE2. For example, residue E484 contributes unfavorably to the binding energy with 2.24 kcal/mol due to an electrostatic repulsion with E75 from hACE2. This residue is an apparent choice for engineering a protein-protein complex with high affinity by substituting E484 with a polar residue. It is, however, noteworthy that the lesser homogeneity of the nodes of SARS-CoV-2 group, in comparison to SARS-CoV, may suggest a higher tolerance . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.
