While there is a wealth of epidemiological studies, little if any molecular characterization of SARS coronavirus (SCoV) proteins has been carried out. Here we describe the molecular characterization of SCoV E protein, a critical component of the virus responsible for virion envelope morphogenesis. We conclusively show that SCoV E protein contains an unusually short, palindromic transmembrane helical hairpin around a previously unidentified pseudo-center of symmetry, a structural feature which seems to be unique to SCoV. The hairpin deforms lipid bilayers by way of increasing their curvature, providing for the first time a molecular explanation of E protein's pivotal role in viral budding. The molecular understanding of this critical component of SCoV may represent the beginning of a concerted effort aimed at inhibiting its function, and consequently, viral infectivity.",

            "text": "Functionally, coronavirus E protein's pivotal role in viral morphogenesis has been studied extensively. Co-expression of Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) E and M proteins on their own has been shown to result in the production of virus-like particles. 4, 5 This fundamental observation proved that neither the nucleocapsid nor the viral spike are needed for viral budding. Work on other viruses, such as Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV), 6 Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) 6 and Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) 7 has shown this to be a general phenomena of the coronaviridea. The interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of the two proteins is thought to take place in pre-Golgi compartments. 8 The importance of the role played by E protein in virus budding and morphogenesis is further strengthened by the observation that in a number of coronaviruses, expression of M protein on its own does not produce virus-like particles. 4 -7,9 In contrast, expression of IBV or MHV E protein on its own causes the release of vesicles containing E protein, thereby pointing to the importance of 0022 coronavirus E protein in the budding process. 7, 9 Interestingly, cells infected with MHV release vesicles containing E protein as well. 9 Finally, mutations in MHV E protein cause marked morphological changes in the resulting viruses. 10 In the cell, evidence has been accumulating suggesting that IBV E protein localizes to the Golgi apparatus, 7 the site from which coronaviruses are known to invaginate into mature virions. During the expression of E protein the Golgi apparatus changes its morphology dramatically, 11 which could explain in part E protein's ability to induce apoptosis. 12, 13 Structurally, E proteins are conserved within the different coronaviridea groups, yet exhibit little sequence similarity between the groups (Figure 1 ). In line with its belonging to a new group within the coronaviridea, SCoV E protein differs substantially from other coronavirus E proteins. 3 Whether this has any bearing upon the marked difference in pathogenicity of SCoV versus other coronaviruses remains to be seen. Finally, SCoV E protein shares no significant sequence similarity with any other known protein.",

Hydrophobic amino acid residues according to the GES scale 28 are indicated by gray shading. 21 residues, 14 far shorter than the hydrophobic stretch of E proteins. In contrast, if a hairpin were to be formed by the long hydrophobic stretch, the resulting helices would be much shorter than the average. Protease digestion of MHV does not affect E protein's molecular mass, suggesting that no part of the protein protrudes beyond the viral membrane. 11 Antibodies raised against the N terminus of the protein could detect the protein only after treatment of the cells with Triton X-110, but not with digitonin. 7 Both of the above studies concluded that the protein traverses the lipid bilayer once, with its C terminus located in the viral interior. 11, 7 More recent results with an epitope tagged MHV E protein are indicative of the protein traversing the lipid bilayer twice, whereby both termini of the protein reside in the virus lumen. 15 In the current study we present the results of a detailed structural examination of SCoV E protein, in which we determine the topology of the protein and the effects upon the lipid bilayer thereof. The results conclusively show that SCoV E protein has a highly unusual topology, consisting of a very short transmembrane helical hairpin. The hairpin forms an inversion about a previously unidentified pseudo-center of symmetry which seems to be unique to SCoV. Electron microscopy studies indicate that the protein dramatically distorts lipid bilayers, causing tubulation. Taken together, the structure of the protein facilitates a molecular explanation of the effects upon the bilayer curvature underpinning the function of the protein in vivo and may represent the beginning of a concerted effort aimed at inhibiting its function and consequently viral infectivity.",

            "text": "In order to examine the secondary structure of the transmembrane domain (TMD) of SCoV E protein, peptides were made which encompassed the entire hydrophobic region of the protein (Glu7-Arg38), as depicted in Figure 1 . The peptide was purified and reconstituted into dimyristoylphosphocholine (DMPC) lipid vesicles, to be used for FTIR spectroscopy. The transmission FTIR spectrum of the resulting proteo-liposomes focusing on the amide I vibrational mode (1600 -1700 cm 21 ) is presented in Figure 3 (a). Since the amide I vibrational mode arises mostly from the peptidic C \u00bc O stretch, its frequency is well correlated with the secondary structure of the protein. 16 Peaks resonating at 1655 cm 21 , 1630 cm 21 and 1645 cm 21 , correspond to a-helical, b-strand and random coil peptide segments, respectively. 16 The amide I mode of SCoV E protein TMD is centered at 1657 cm 21 with a peak-width at half height of 23 cm 21 , both indicative of the very high helical content of the protein, and the absence of any other secondary structure component. 16 E protein contains 26 residues embedded in the lipid bilayer FTIR spectroscopy can be used to delineate the extent of membrane incorporation of transmembrane proteins. This is achieved by observing the reduction in any vibrational mode containing significant contributions from the amide proton (e.g II mode : peptidic N -H deformation) upon exchanging the solvent from H 2 O to D 2 O. The reason is that the lipid bilayer protects the peptide from exchange, whereas amide groups exposed to the solvent undergo H \u00fe /D \u00fe exchange. Any vibrational mode containing the \"new\" N -D group will resonate elsewhere and H \u00fe /D \u00fe exchange can be quantitated by measuring the reduction in the amide II mode directly. 16 As shown in Figure 3 (b), upon flushing the membrane with air saturated with D 2 O for several hours, the reduction in the amide II peak, centered at 1545 cm 21 , is minimal. Since the amide I peak at 1657 cm 21 is not expected to undergo any intensity changes upon exchange from H 2 O to D 2 O, it is possible to calculate the extent of exchange by normalizing both spectra (in H 2 O and D 2 O) on the amide I peak. The resulting exchange rate of 19^2% is indicative of only six out of 32 residues in the peptide undergoing H \u00fe /D \u00fe exchange. In other words, 26 residues of SCoV E protein are protected from exchange as a result of their being embedded in the lipid bilayer. Note that this value corresponds exactly to the length of the hydrophobic stretch of the protein.",

The dichroism (ratio of absorption of parallel and perpendicular polarized light) for the amide I peak (centered at 1657 cm 21 ) is 3.76^0.52. From this dichroism it is possible to calculate an exceptionally high order parameter for the peptide of S \u00bc 0:82^0:17, a value nearing the theoretical limit. 17 When taking into account sample disorder, it is possible to convert the maximal value of the measured order parameter to a maximal tilt angle.

Thus, there are two ways in which to describe the structure of the protein: either as a single long transmembrane helix, or as two short helices forming a transmembrane helical hairpin. Both models however, incur a hydrophobicity mismatch between the protein and the bilayer. In the case of a single helix, the hydrophobic stretch is too long relative to the bilayer thickness. \u2020 On the other hand, the helical hairpin would have to be comprised of two very short helices in order to enable the 26 residues to traverse the membrane twice. Since the smallest possible loop is of three residues, each helix cannot contain more than 11-12 hydrophobic residues. This value is much smaller than the average of 21 residues per transmembrane helix. 14 In order to conclusively determine the topology of SCoV E protein we iodinated Phe23, which is located at the center of the hydrophobic stretch of the protein (see Figure 1) . FTIR spectroscopy has shown that the iodinated and unlabeled peptides are indistinguishable in any of the experiments described above (data not shown). Electron density profiles obtained using X-ray scattering should be able to pinpoint the position of the labeled electron-dense iodine. As shown in Figure 4 , the electron density of lipid vesicles containing iodinated and unlabeled SCoV E protein transmembrane domain exhibit normal density profiles. 18 However, upon subtracting the densities form one another, clear density resulting from the iodine label is identified, located 16.5 \u00c5 from the bilayer core, close to the lipid head-group region. Thus, one can clearly state that the labeled Phe23 is located adjacent to the head-group region, despite the fact that it is in the middle of the hydrophobic segment of the protein. Taken together, our data prove conclusively that the transmembrane domain of SCoV E protein forms a hairpin with unusually short hydrophobic helices.",

The tilt angle between the helices was set to 08, according to the high degree of orientation found experimentally.

The hydrophobic stretch of both hairpin helices is only 11 residues long, which is much shorter than the average of 21 residues. 14 At the apex of the hairpin three amino acid residues have their amide carbonyl and amine groups unpaired, surrounded by an aromatic belt. At the other end of the hairpin a cluster of charged residues is located. The distance between these two polar elements is much shorter than the hydrophobic thickness of the lipid bilayer. The polarity of both elements is not equal however, whereby the charged residues at the opening of the hairpin predominate. Thus, one can speculate that the hairpin opening is situated at the lipid headgroup region of one leaflet. Therefore, the hairpin apex is situated in the hydrophobic region of the bilayer, with its aromatic belt (known for its affinity to the polar head group) and unpaired amide groups poised to attract the lipid head-group region. It is this attraction that exerts a deformation force on the bilayer, causing an increase in curvature.",
