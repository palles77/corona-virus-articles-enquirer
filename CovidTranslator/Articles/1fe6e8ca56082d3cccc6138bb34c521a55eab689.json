Pronghorns and other primarily grazing species have a large, stratified rumen, a smaller reticulum, a welldeveloped omasum, a larger abomasum, and roughly twice the relative intestinal length (25-30 times body length) of browsing species. This anatomy is adapted for digestion of large amounts of cellulose. Browsers have a smaller rumen, with evenly distributed, dense ruminal papillae, and tend to have comparatively larger salivary glands and livers compared with grazers. 51 A gallbladder is usually present in bovids, and the kidneys may or may not be lobulated. 10 Reproductive anatomy is similar to that of domestic cattle in most bovids, with the exception that females of some species such as the Hippotraginae demonstrate duplex uteri, in which the cervix is bifurcated, creating a physical separation between the uterine horns with no uterine body.",

            "text": "The 21st century has brought a grim outlook to the conservation of nondomestic bovid species. Ever-increasing human populations and their livestock encroaching on natural habitats, agriculture, transportation infrastructure, and fencing are some of the factors causing disruption of habitat and migration and are decreasing population size and genetic diversity across the taxon. In captivity, a loss of nearly 1000 spaces for antelope between 1999 and 2011 and a predicted decline in future space are reported by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) Antelope Taxon Advisory Group. 2 Of the 82 species of ungulates in AZA collections, 42% are in decline or have a negative growth rate. Few sustainable bovid populationsthose that are able to persist indefinitely without supplementationexist, either in the wild or in captivity. Over 25% of antelope species are threatened by extinction, three exist in populations of fewer than 500 individuals, and many are not represented by captive populations, all of which increases the risk of extinction. 34 Recent recommendations to manage antelope in larger, less intensively managed groups have been based on (1) the difficulty of maintaining genetic diversity in small, isolated captive populations; (2) the risk of transporting animals for breeding purposes; (3) advanced methodology in genetics and population modeling; and (4) the relative success of large-landscape game ranches in population management. 34, 57 Special Housing Requirements Pronghorns in the wild are accustomed to wide open spaces in arid regions and may tolerate wide temperature fluctuations. They often do not thrive in captivity and are compromised by high humidity, unnatural social structure, novel stimuli, and enclosed spaces. They are more likely to crawl under fencing than to jump over fencing 1.5 meters (m) or higher, but until accustomed to an enclosure, this fractious species should have visible sight barriers and minimal obstacles near fence lines to reduce trauma. A shelter that does not restrict view may be preferred by pronghorns over an enclosed barn. 10 In captivity, they benefit behaviorally from frequent human proximity from a young age to maintain tractability. Pronghorns are CHAPTER 63 \u2022 Bovidae (Except Sheep and Goats) Milk composition varies considerably among species, and a formula' s composition should mimic that of the dam' s milk in protein, carbohydrate, fat, and total solids. Goat' s milk is a good choice for many species, alone or in combination with a milk replacer. However, milk may be low in vitamin E, zinc, copper, and iron, necessitating vitamin and mineral supplementation. Probiotics may also be relatively tolerant of species with which they have historically grazed (bison, elk, and deer); however, interspecific aggression has been documented. 10 Housing and husbandry practices for antelope and cattle species vary widely, depending on management goals, climate, and available space. Fences and bomas may be constructed of a variety of materials and should be a minimum of 2.5 m (8 feet) in height and designed with the species size, temperament, and jumping ability in mind. Fences with sight barriers are beneficial in management areas to prevent trauma and between adjacent enclosures to prevent aggression and fence damage. Electric wires may be useful for keeping animals away from fence lines but may also present an entrapment and trauma risk through horn entanglement. Space and temperature recommendations are listed in Table 63 -2. Some species may experience regular hoof problems when housed on substrates to which they are not adapted. For example, hoof abscesses may be common in desert species exposed to muddy conditions for prolonged periods. Indoor substrates should be considered with regard to hoof hardness and wear to minimize trimming and hoof lesions.",

Desert-adapted animals may tolerate high temperatures (\u226538\u00b0 C [100\u00b0 F]) provided adequate water and shade are available, but most desert and tropical species need to be housed indoors during the cold season in colder regions. Frostbite and ear tip loss are frequently seen at temperatures below 9\u00b0 C (15\u00b0 F). Forest and cold-adapted or altitude-adapted species may require more shade during the warm season, and shelters for all species should provide cover and windbreaks facing away from prevailing winds. 10 Forest species such as duikers will benefit from plantings or other structures that support hiding behaviors. Indoor housing should provide temperatures between 10\u00b0 C and 27\u00b0 C (50\u00b0 F-80\u00b0 F), with adequate ventilation to control humidity and reduce ammonia concentrations. beneficial in establishing a healthy rumen flora. Calves should receive 8% to 15% of their body weight in formula every 24 hours, divided into four to six feedings per day. Resources are available to assist with milk replacer formulation and methods of feeding. 48, 59 In the first 2 to 3 weeks of a ruminant' s life, milk digestion occurs in the abomasum and small intestine. Milk deposited into the nonfunctional rumenoreticulum during this period is not digested and may lead to rumenitis and septicemia. 15 For this reason, tube feeding or force feeding a calf with a poor suckle response may be harmful. Closure of the esophageal groove is stimulated by suckling TA B L E 6 3 -2 and normally prevents this deposition. If tube feeding is necessary in the first weeks of life, a tube passed to the mid-esophagus may stimulate swallowing and closure of the groove. Additionally, oral administration of 10% sodium bicarbonate or 2% to 5% copper sulfate prior to milk feeding may facilitate groove closure for several minutes. By 2 to 3 weeks, the ruminal papillae are stimulated, and the calf begins to take in small amounts of dry feed. Changes in gastrointestinal (GI) flora occur throughout this period and until weaning (around 4 months), often manifesting as changes in fecal consistency. and expertise available, and each procedure conducted must be planned with the animal, handler ability, and equipment in mind. Restraint may be classified as physical, behavioral, and chemical, and many procedures in these taxa will require some combination of all three methods. Planning for any restraint procedure should take into account the goal, the conditions (e.g., restraint type and capability, ambient temperature, footing, enclosure size), and the temperament of the animal. 9 Restraint planning should also include plans for alternative physical and chemical restraint and emergency release in case of injury, failure of behavioral compliance, or signs of severe distress in the animal. Safety of the personnel and the patient are the primary considerations. Any manipulation of bovids and pronghorns may result in extreme panic, self-injury, capture myopathy (see Noninfectious Disease), and even sudden death, necessitating efficiency of time and force used to achieve the goal of restraint.",

Desensitization and operant conditioning may be used to train animals to move calmly to a restraint area, enter a chute or crate, lie down, or tolerate minor procedures, but special attention to the explosive nature of many bovids requires slow, deliberate movements, quiet conditions, and safety precautions.

Restraint should be initiated on an isolated animal in a darkened, quiet, obstacle-free enclosure that is small enough to minimize the risk of injury to the animal but large enough to allow free movement and escape of the handlers. A stall with padded walls and hay or straw floor substrate is optimal for animal safety. A minimum of two handlers should perform the capture, depending on the size and temperament of the animal, and the handlers should wear protective clothing, footwear, eyewear and gloves. Hand restraint in bovids under 5 kg may be accomplished by a single handler by quickly lifting the animal, supporting the abdomen and spine against the handler' s body, and restraining the head and legs. Restraint of medium-sized animals may be initiated by catching the head and quickly pushing the animal against a wall, pad, or floor with head restraint and placing a knee under the flank, with a second handler restraining the rear legs. Horns may be used for restraint of most species, but young animals or those with thin horns may be prone to horn avulsion. The head and legs should be tightly restrained to prevent the use of horns and hooves, and placement of a hand or a pad between the hocks may help to prevent self-trauma. The duration of physical restraint should be minimized to prevent distress and hyperthermia, and a clear airway and adequate chest excursion should be ensured at all times. Use of a blindfold may reduce struggling. If an animal is to be restrained repeatedly, short pieces of hosing placed on the horn tips improves safety for the handlers. Release should be coordinated such that handlers act quickly and in concert, directing the animal toward a clear path and to an open area that provides the patient with a sense of refuge and minimizes the risk of injury.",

            "text": "The development of sophisticated chute systems for hoof stock has allowed for the handling of entire herds of nondomestic bovids rapidly and without chemical restraint. 25 Procedures such as Feeding the Adult Many of the common health problems of nondomestic ruminants have recently been associated with direct or indirect dietary causes. 11 Chronic weight loss, rumen acidosis or rumenitis, laminitis, hoof overgrowth, and periodontal disease have all been attributed, at least in part, to historical feeding of all exotic bovids diets designed for domestic cattle. Cattle are grazing species, but many of the nondomestic Bovidae are intermediate or browse feeders. Browsers are adapted to eating the leaves and twigs of woody plants, intermediate feeders to both browse and grasses, and grazers to consuming grasses (see Table 63 -1). All of these forages are fermented by the microbes of the ruminoreticulum, which produce fatty acids, providing energy to the ruminant. The grazer rumen is adapted for fermenting the high cellulose content in grasses through prolonged fermentation and particle retention, compared with the smaller, less muscular browser rumen. Consequently, browsers tend to eat less hay and are often fed higher amounts of pelleted concentrate to compensate for low hay consumption. High levels of easily digested carbohydrates such as starch and sugar, often found in pelleted concentrates, are too rapidly fermented in the rumen, leading to rumen acidosis. The ideal rumen pH range is 6.7 \u00b1 0.5, and variation from this results in disturbance of the microflora. Altered and depleted rumen flora decrease the energy delivered to the ruminant, which results in weight loss. In response, many of these animals will receive increased amounts of concentrate, which compounds the problem. Rumen acidosis and resulting rumenitis may also lead to systemic acidosis, mineral imbalances, and laminitis or abnormal hoof growth.",

The recommended feed intake is 1.5% to 2.5% of body weight per day in addition to ad libitum grass or legume hay, and supplementation with natural nontoxic browse is recommended for all browsers.

Capture and restraint of animals in the wild is conducted by a multitude of means, including drive nets, drop nets, net guns, bomas, chutes, traps, and remote injection. Some of these procedures require helicopters and specialized training and are conducted by full-time capture professionals. In zoologic settings, capture and restraint capabilities depend on the facilities management for capture, translocation, isolation, or adaptation to environmental changes. 10, 16, 44 Licensed for use in humans as antipsychotic agents, these drugs act by blocking D2 dopamine receptors, thereby producing a state of lucid relief from anxiety. Most of the longer-acting formulations have an onset of action of 1 to 3 days, necessitating the addition of short-acting neuroleptics to produce immediate and long-term tranquilization. Table 63-3 lists common  formulations and their onset and duration of action, and Table 63-4 lists suggested doses of neuroleptic drugs for tranquilization of pronghorns and bovids. Recommended dosages per kilogram of body weight are inversely proportional to body size. It should be noted that neuroleptic use may improve the ease of captive management of smaller hoof stock by increasing flight distance, but reducing the fear response may have the opposite effect in larger, more aggressive species, resulting in reduced avoidance behavior, reluctance to move, and aggression. Overdosing is known to produce behavioral side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, including abnormal facial and tongue posture, head pressing and other unusual movement patterns, and anorexia. Treatment of clinical signs of overdosing may be accomplished using low doses of xylazine, diazepam, or diphenhydramine. 44",

            "text": "General anesthesia is induced parenterally by intramuscular or intravenous routes. Intravenous administration may be performed on manually or mechanically restrained animals and provides the advantage of decreased induction and recovery time. However, in larger animals, intravenous administration of a mechanically restrained animal may result in difficulty in removing the rapidlyinduced animal from the restraint device. In general, intramuscular induction of an animal with an appropriate regimen in a darkened, quiet enclosure provides a relatively rapid and smooth induction and may minimize the need for anesthetic supplementation because of longer duration of action. Administration of anesthetics intramuscularly (IM) may be conducted by hand, pole syringe, or projectile dart. The use of darts and remote injection systems has been previously reviewed 27 and requires careful planning and experience. Planning an anesthetic event should include considerations such as environmental temperatures, approach, enclosure size, obstacles, and the presence of other animals. Failure to deliver an appropriate dose accurately and quickly to an animal in the wild or in a large enclosure may result in excessive running or pacing injury, capture stress or myopathy, and death. Muscle masses of the rump, shoulder, and neck are preferred sites of remote injection. Failure of induction within an appropriate time (usually 5 to 15 minutes, depending on the regimen) may be caused by many factors, including dart failure, venipuncture, vaccination, tuberculin testing, physical examination, treatment of minor conditions, hoof trimming, and reproductive procedures may be conducted without chemical restraint in an effectively designed chute system. In designing a restraint, considerations such as maneuvering animals from a pen into the chute, the ability to stop and sort animals within the system, the inclusion of movable rear walls for pushing resistant animals, the presence of a scale within the system, and multiple exit routes may be critical to creating a process that is efficient and safe, minimizing time and stress to the animals. Desensitizing animals to any chute system by incorporating movement through the system into the animals' regular routine may greatly facilitate restraint. Many facilities housing large numbers of bovid and equid species are now using chute systems to facilitate preventive medicine, reproductive management, research, and extended treatment of animals, while alleviating the need for repeated chemical restraint.",

Chemical restraint is commonly necessary in the management of nondomestic bovids and carries significant risks because of the fractious nature of the species, the difficulty of drug delivery, and the unique biology of the taxon. Veterinary practitioners caring for nondomestic Bovidae are constantly evaluating and improving protocols for sedation and anesthesia, as sensitivity to different anesthetics among nondomestic bovids tend to be species-specific. Chemical restraint in this taxon has been the subject of many reviews. 3, 10, 13, 29, 53 Tranquilization and Sedation Chemical restraint may be accomplished by two means: tranquilization and general anesthesia. Increasingly, neuroleptics of the butyrophenone and phenothiazine families have been used to attenuate the stress response in nondomestic ruminants undergoing intensive inappropriate dosing, and operator error. A partially anesthetized animal is susceptible to capture myopathy, so a decision to repeat induction should be made within 20 minutes of initial dart placement. Supplementation by remote means generally requires a full anesthetic dose, as the animal may be rapidly metabolizing the anesthetic because of stress and activity. Many anesthetic regimens have been described for pronghorns and bovids, 3,10,29 ,53 and these regimens generally consist of ultrapotent narcotics (carfentanil, etorphine, thiafentanil), with or without sedatives or tranquilizers (\u03b1 2 -agonists, butyrophenones), dissociative cyclohexamines (ketamine or tiletamine), or both. The use of the mixed opioid agonist-antagonist butorphanol tartrate as a component of anesthetic cocktails has been recently reviewed. 6 Historically, the ultrapotent opioid (narcotic) agents carfentanil citrate, etorphine, and thiafentanil oxalate have been the primary components of anesthetic cocktails used in nondomestic bovid species for many reasons:",

Selected diseases of concern to zoologic species of bovids and pronghorns are listed in Tables 63-10 and 63-11. Bacterial infections are of increasing importance in zoologic species because of multidrug-resistant pathogens. 28 Abscesses and other infections caused by pathogens such as Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, and others may lead to systemic infection and death if not treated to resolution, on the basis of culture and sensitivity testing. Strict sanitation measures in hospital settings are required to prevent frequent infections and development of antibacterial resistance of resident organisms. Hoof infections are particularly common in some species, especially in weather and substrate conditions unnatural to the species 60 and may involve lengthy treatment with systemic antibiotics, regional perfusion, hoof curettage, topical treatment, and protective bandaging. Some animals cannot tolerate long-term confinement to allow healing: once infection is eliminated, hoof deficits may, in some cases, be filled with hoof repair material (which may be impregnated with antibiotics), allowing return of the animal to its home enclosure. These materials are worn away as granulation tissue fills the hoof capsule and results in a normal hoof. Mycobacterial diseases remain a concern because of the lack of clinical signs in early stages and to the sensitivity and specificity of existing diagnostics. Of most concern are tuberculosis 37 (Mycobacte-include trauma, abscesses, horn fractures and avulsions, hoof abscesses, castration, vasectomy, herniorrhaphy, ovariectomy, ovariohysterectomy, exploratory laparotomy, and tumor excisions. Less commonly, eye enucleation, cesarean section, and surgical treatment of corneal lacerations and ulcers, cataracts, angular limb deformities, GI or urinary obstructions, umbilical abscess, patent urachus, and rectal, uterine or vaginal prolapse are warranted. 10 Laparoscopy is useful in nondomestic bovids for assisted reproduction, minimally invasive abdominal and thoracic exploratory, biopsy, and endosurgical techniques. In large bovids, laparoscopic procedures may require intubation and positive pressure ventilation because of the pressure of the abdominal viscera on the thoracic cavity when the animal has been secured in dorsal recumbency at a head-down tilt.",

            "text": "Capture myopathy was first described decades ago and remains a significant concern in pronghorns and bovids under all conditions of management. 42, 54 The syndrome is most often associated with prolonged pursuit, capture, restraint, transportation, and high ambient temperatures, although many other stress-inducing factors may precipitate its development. Capture myopathy is most commonly characterized by ataxia, metabolic acidosis, muscle necrosis, and myoglobinuria; however, several closely related syndromes have been described (Table 63- 12) . In general, the pathophysiology of the disease includes exhaustion of muscular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (skeletal and cardiac), decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, and increased production of lactic acid leading to muscle necrosis, myoglobin release, and renal failure. Predisposing factors include species (reported to be common in pronghorn, nyala, tsessebe, duiker, roan, hartebeest, eland, springbok, kudu, and impala 17 ); environment (high temperature and humidity); capture or restraint; underlying conditions (pregnancy, advanced age); and vitamin E or selenium deficiency. By the time signs of capture myopathy are obvious, treatment is generally unrewarding. Prevention consists primarily of careful restraint planning and includes limiting pursuit to less than 3 minutes; avoiding capture in ambient temperatures over 20\u00b0 C; reducing visual and auditory stimulation during restraint; minimizing restraint time; and using sedation and general anesthesia, when warranted. If, despite careful planning, an animal becomes highly stressed, hyperthermic, or hypoxemic during capture, (WA-MCF), are caused by ovine herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2) and alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (AlHV-1), respectively. Both viruses are carried asymptomatically in the reservoir host species (after which they are named), are pathogenic to other species, and are shed through ocular and oronasal secretions. WA-MCF is generally transmitted by calves from birth up to 4 months of age, but lambs are generally not infected with OvHV-1 until after 2 months of age and shed the pathogen intensively from 6 to 9 months of age. Lambs may, therefore, be separated from dams and raised virus-free. 32 Other described MCF viruses include hippotragine (HipHV-1) and alcelaphine 2 (AlHV-2) MCF, isolated from roan antelopes and hartebeests, respectively, but the epidemiology of these viruses remains poorly understood. Oryxes, ibexes, muskoxen, and aoudads are also known to harbor MCF viruses of unknown pathogenicity. Species susceptible to disease caused by MCF viruses include cattle, bison, deer, and pigs, but sporadic cases of MCF or MCF-like disease in a variety of captive nondomestic bovids have been reported. 22, 32 Susceptible hosts may be subclinically or clinically affected. Bison are known to be 1000 times more susceptible, compared with cattle, to clinical SA-MCF, 32 and bongos have been recently reported to acquire fatal MCF from Nubian ibexes. 22, 32 The clinical presentation of MCF is variable but usually includes profuse nasal and ocular discharge, corneal opacity, diarrhea, enlarged lymph nodes, fever, anorexia, and often death within 24 to 72 hours. Pathologic findings include lymphoproliferative vasculitis and epithelial necrosis. Identification of clinically relevant reservoir species is complicated by the incomplete characterization of these complex and evolving viruses: serologic tests distinguishing OvHV-2 and AlHV-1, however, are available. In the face of a suspected outbreak in a mixed-species situation, a multiplex PCR is the first choice diagnostic. 32",

These techniques also have the potential advantage of reducing the risk of disease transmission, but international transport of gametes remains challenging because of the risk of transboundary disease transmission. 43 Because assisted reproduction has been widely used in domestic cattle, techniques have been adapted from domestic protocols for many nondomestic species. 39 However, species differences in estrous cycle length, sensitivity to exogenous hormones, and stress response have limited the success of using domestic bovine protocols in bovids. In general, estrus synchronization protocols must be developed through research on each species. To date, estrus synchronization and artificial insemination using frozen-thawed semen have been successful in the eland, banteng, gaur, addax, scimitar-horned oryx, suni, blackbuck, Speke gazelle, Mhorr gazelle, and springbok. 39, 43 Perinatal Care Neonatal mortality rates among nondomestic bovids are often over 30%. Because management techniques differ significantly between these animals and their domestic counterparts, an understanding of the special needs and risks involved in dam and neonate management may prevent unnecessary problems and losses, as previously reviewed. 56 Housing should provide the opportunity for seclusion, adequate ventilation and drainage, and exposure to sunlight. Species with strong herd instincts may be most successful when housed with conspecifics and in a familiar environment during calving. In temperate areas, careful timing of breeding to favor mild-season calving may also improve neonatal survival. One month prior to expected parturition, the energy ration should be increased and special attention paid to the provision of adequate calcium and minerals, particularly if the regional soil is deficient in specific minerals such as selenium.",

Male behavior such as following, foreleg kicking, chin resting, and mounting may be good indicators of estrus; however, females will generally only stand to be mounted by a male during peak estrus. Seasonality varies among artiodactyls and may shift to some degree ex situ. Species from higher latitudes tend to be more seasonal compared with tropical species. 58 Onset of sexual maturity may vary widely within and among species and is influenced by diet and general health (see Table 63 -1). In herd settings, the removal of the breeding male may accelerate sexual maturity in young males. Fertility assessment in males is best achieved by microscopic examination of spermatozoa, collected by electroejaculation under general anesthesia. Most healthy bovid species produce highly concentrated spermatozoa with over 50% motile cells. Diagnosis of pregnancy may be made through rectal palpation or ultrasonography in many bovids; however, the risk of anesthesia, if necessary, may outweigh the benefit of early pregnancy diagnosis in many fractious species. Fecal progestin assays, available in many laboratories, provide a means of noninvasive pregnancy Impending parturition may be signified by teat and udder enlargement (weeks) and vulvar swelling or relaxation (days) prior to parturition. Dams will often seek isolation and give birth at night. Dystocia is not uncommon, particularly in species of limited genetic diversity, and represents an important risk factor for morbidity and mortality in calves. If birth intervention is required, many dams will not accept an offspring following general anesthesia, resulting in failure of passive transfer (FPT) and the need for hand rearing.",

Neonates born to anesthetized dams may have pharmacologic respiratory depression and should receive specific antagonists. Oxygen therapy has been shown to improve neonatal survival in at-risk domestic calves. 40 Intravenous fluid therapy may improve the chance of survival and provides a means of rapidly treating metabolic abnormalities. Treatment for acidosis with sodium bicarbonate (see Table 63 -13) should only be administered after the establishment of a normal breathing pattern and may otherwise exacerbate respiratory acidosis. Provision of an external heat source 24 hours or more after parturition may improve thermoregulation, oxygen saturation, tidal volume, and respiratory rate. 40 Common causes of illness in neonatal ruminants include acidosis, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, dehydration, pneumonia, and septicemia, each of which may be rapidly fatal. 36 Physical examination findings of hypothermia or hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, hyperemia or petechiae of mucous membranes, increased capillary refill time, cold extremities, diminished peripheral pulse, and inability to correct hypoglycemia despite treatment are suggestive of septicemia. Supportive treatment for neonatal septicemia should include provision of a clean, warm, lowly lit environment; soft, clean bedding; intravenous fluid supplementation; and plasma transfusion, colostrum supplementation, or milk-based nutritional support, depending on the age and condition of the neonate.
