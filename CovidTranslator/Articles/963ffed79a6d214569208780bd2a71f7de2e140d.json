This version will undergo additional copyediting, typesetting and review before it is published in its final form, but we are providing this version to give early visibility of the article. Please note that, during the production process, errors may be discovered which could affect the content, and all legal disclaimers that apply to the journal pertain. The COVID-19 epidemic in China has ignited another epidemic of stress, anxiety and depression (Bao et al., 2020) . Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the Chinese government has taken proactive measures to contain not only the spread of the novel coronavirus but also that of psychological distress in the public. A series of national and provincial policies were enacted to guide emergency psychological crisis interventions for the epidemic. And mainly due to their high feasibility, online mental health services, as Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2020) noted, have been established as essential measures to address mental health needs in the epidemic and have been sprouting up in China since last month.",

First, to date, most of our attention has been focused on the provision of online mental health services, with the utilization of these services to a large extent neglected. In fact, China has long been faced with an extremely low rate of mental health service utilization (Shi et al., 2019) . And based on one survey involving 108 participants with high acute stress in this epidemic (defined as experiencing at least \"sometimes\" \u22653 dissociative, \u22651 avoidance, \u22651 intrusive, and \u22651 arousal symptoms in the Stanford Acute Stress Response Questionnaire), we found that as low as 3.7% of them had ever used mental health services since the outbreak of COVID-19. And it is still unknown whether online mental health services can improve mental health service utilization especially in low and middle-income countries (Kauer et al., 2014) .",

Individuals with lower socioeconomic status (SES) might not have as much access to digital technologies, on which online mental health services rely heavily, as those with higher SES do.
