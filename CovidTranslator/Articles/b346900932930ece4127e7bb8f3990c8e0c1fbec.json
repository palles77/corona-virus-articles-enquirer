It restricts a diverse group of pathogenic, enveloped viruses, by interfering with endosomal fusion. In this report, the swine IFITM3 (sIFITM3) gene was cloned. It shares the functionally conserved CD225 domain and multiple critical amino acid residues (Y19, F74, F77, R86 and Y98) with its human ortholog, which are essential for antiviral activity. Ectopic expression of sIFITM3 significantly inhibited non-enveloped foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection in BHK-21 cells. Furthermore, sIFITM3 blocked FMDV infection at early steps in the virus life cycle by disrupting viral attachment to the host cell surface. Importantly, inoculation of 2-day-old suckling mice with a plasmid expressing sIFITM3 conferred protection against lethal challenge with FMDV. These results suggest that sIFITM3 is a promising antiviral agent and that can safeguard the host from infection with FMDV.",

The human IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) was recently identified as a new antiviral effector of the ISGs family. Overexpression of IFITM3 blocks infection of a wide range of highly pathogenic enveloped viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), West Nile virus, dengue virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, as well as one non-enveloped reovirus (Anafu et al., 2013; Brass et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2011; Weidner et al., 2010) .",

Amino acid (aa) sequence analysis of IFITM3 and its other four human paralogs (IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM5 and IFITM10) reveals that they have two intramembrane domains (IM1 and IM2) and a conserved intracellular loop (CIL), flanked by short variable N-terminal and C-terminal domains (John et al., 2013) . The intramembrane domains and CIL constitute the CD225 domain that is shared by hundreds of CD225 domain family members (Punta et al., 2012) . Brass et al. (2009) first demonstrated the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins using a functional RNAi genomic screen. IFITM3 expression accounted for 50-80% of IFNs' ability to block IAV infection and exhibited early viral infection restriction (Brass et al., 2009) . IFITM3 potently restricts the viral entry by altering the properties of cellular endolysosomal membranes, thus creating an unfavorable milieu for viral fusion with membranes (Amini- Bavil-Olyaee et al., 2013; Feeley et al., 2011) . IFITM3 further blocks cytosolic entry of viruses and the release of viral genomes, resulting in degradation of pathogens trapped within later endosomal or lysosomal compartments.",

Inoculation of swine with adenovirus-delivered type I IFN confers 100% protection against FMDVcaused fever, vesicular lesions, and viremia and this protection can be maintained for 3-5 days (Chinsangaram et al., 2003) .

Later, an acidic pH within the endosome is required to disassemble the capsid and translocate viral RNA into the cytoplasm (Johns et al., 2009) . Ebola virus, IAV and VSV that exhibit similar entry patterns are inhibited by human IFITM3 (Bhattacharyya et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2011; Lakadamyali et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2005; Weidner et al., 2010) . The aim of this study was to clone swine IFITM3 (sIFITM3) and examine if it could restrict FMDV infection. Our results demonstrate that sIFITM3 has a similarly functional CD225 domain and several critical conserved aa residues that correspond to its human ortholog. Ectopic expression of sIFITM3 inhibited infection of non-enveloped FMDV in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells by disrupting viral attachment, and this differs from human IFITM3 restriction on enveloped viruses. Inoculation of suckling mice with a plasmid expressing sIFITM3 confers protection against lethal FMDV challenge. These data suggest that sIFITM3 is a novel and potent antiviral agent that could be used to enhance animal resistance to FMDV infection.",

Mean fluorescence intensity analysis showed that each BHK-eGFP cell captured more viral particles than BHK-sIFITM3 cell (P < 0.01) (Fig. 4D) . (Fig. 5A ). All PBS-treated mice died within 5 days, and 88.8% of the pCA-treated mice died within 7 days post viral challenge (Fig. 5B) . Six of the 10 mice inoculated with pCA-sIFITM3 survived the viral challenge, and this difference was statistically significant from the PBS and pCA control groups (P < 0.01). These data indicated that sIFITM3 conferred protection against lethal O/ ES/2001 challenge in the suckling mice. One out of the nine mice in pCA group survived.

IFITM3 is a transmembrane protein that is mainly stimulated by type I IFN. It has been implicated in a broad range of cellular processes including adhesion, apoptosis, immune cell signaling, oncogenesis cell adhesion, heart development, germ cell homing, and repulsion (Siegrist et al., 2011) . IFITM3 is also responsible for IFN-induced cell growth inhibition by transduction of antiproliferative signals (Brem et al., 2003) . However, our data show that expression of sIFITM3 in BHK-21 cells does not interfere with cell growth in comparison with the BHK-eGFP, as previous studies (data not shown) (Brass et al., 2009; Weidner et al., 2010) .

In addition, integrins recycling on endosomes membrane serve as main receptors recognizing FMDV particles (Johns et al., 2009) . Siljamaki et al. reported that cholesterol stability plays a vital role in integrin a2 uptake and in the formation of integrin-specific multi-vesicular bodies during virus infection (Siljamaki et al., 2013) . Cholesterol aggregation can halt integrin a2 uptake and prevent internalization. It has also been reported that IFITM1, the paralog of IFITM3, interacts with hepatitis C virus receptors CD81 and occludin to disrupt the process of viral entry (Wilkins et al., 2013) . In future studies, it will be interesting to explore the relationship between the biological features, steady state of FMDV receptors and sIFITM3 expression.",

Therefore, we postulate that virus attachment is not the only step that is targeted by sIFITM3 during FMDV infection. We cannot exclude the possibility that sIFITM3 also alter endosomes in BHK-21 cells in order to prevent the disassembly of the viral capsids and viral RNA release. We suppose that the 3-to 4-fold decrease in viral attachment associated with sIFITM3 expression cannot fully account for over 100-fold decrease in viral production.",

Our data indicate that sIFITM3 is a potent swine-originated factor defense against FMDV infection in BHK-21 cells and suckling mice.

O/ES/2001 caused obvious CPE in BHK-eGFP cells as early as 12 h post infection, and all cells were dead at 24 h post infection (Fig. 3A). In contrast, only slight CPE was observed in the BHK-sIFITM3 cells up until 24 h post infection. Similarly, O/ES/2001 titers in cell supernatants collected at different time points post-infection were lower in BHK-sIFITM3 cells than in BHK-eGFP cells (P < 0.01) (Fig. 3B). As early as 6 h post infection, expression of sIFITM3 substantially inhibited O/ES/2001 production at least 100-fold, and cells maintained antiviral status as long as 36 h post-infection (P < 0.01)",
