These regulations, known as IHR (2005) , are binding to all member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) and include several major provisions aimed at facilitating global communication and cooperation for early detection and containment of events termed public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC).

The health focus within SPP was to enhance public health cross-border coordination in infectious disease surveillance, prevention, and control. In particular, leaders of the 3 nations agreed to a set of principles that would guide collaboration in the detection and response to avian and pandemic influenza. These principles led to the formulation of the North American Plan for Avian and Pandemic Influenza (NAPAPI). This plan stresses the need for communication between nations and coordination in responding to the threat of a novel strain of influenza; it also lays out a set of actions for each nation relative to emergency coordination and communications, avian influenza, pandemic influenza, border monitoring and control measures, and critical infrastructure protection (9). A senior level coordinating body was established to facilitate planning and preparedness as well as to serve as a contact in the event of a human outbreak caused by a novel strain of influenza (10).",

Other nations interrupted trade of pork products from the United States, disregarding the determination by WHO and global scientists that cooked pork does not transmit the virus. In addition, some countries quarantined North American citizens, regardless of potential exposure to influenza A virus (H1N1). One of these countries defended its decision to quarantine persons from North America by citing what it believed is the failure of the United States and Mexico to implement entry and exit screening to detect cases of infection with influenza virus (H1N1) (33) .

Although it is impossible to predict the exact nature of an emergency, thoughtful planning enables all affected parties to know their responsibilities and to know with whom they need to work. Time is not wasted on developing procedures and contacts during an emergency. Instead, responders can focus on mitigating the consequences of the event. Planning does not guarantee that everything will run smoothly, or that all nations will adhere to agreed-upon regulations.

An obvious comparison is the global communication mechanisms around an emerging epidemic. When WHO needed to reach the global community to alert it to the emergence of SARS, it needed to hold a press conference on a Saturday morning. No mechanism was in place for communicating with member states in a timely fashion. The creation of National IHR Focal Points enabled rapid communication between WHO and the entire global community, and guaranteed that proper authorities were notified and that information was shared with appropriate policy makers and responders.
