A DNA microarray platform that can simultaneously detect and characterize many different types of human pathogens that cause similar symptoms provides considerable potential for both medical use and national defense purposes (Bodrossy and Sessitsch 2004; Cleland et al. 2004) . DNA microarrays do this by simultaneously interrogating hundreds to thousands of immobilized probe DNA oligonucleotides, where each probe provides a single query for a known sequence that is unique for an organism or trait.

            "text": "Another hurdle to using spotted microarrays is that the de-sign of specific oligonucleotide probes for pathogen identification is dependent on assumptions regarding target sequence composition. Long (50-70mer) oligonucleotide probes used in most prior studies have the disadvantage of decreased specificity (threshold for differentiation at 75%-87% sequence similarity), making it necessary to target multiple markers and rely on hybridization patterns for pathogen identification, which can lead to unquantifiable errors (Bodrossy and Sessitsch 2004) . Nevertheless, these microarrays have provided a successful platform for screening a large number of pathogens at a viral family level via the use of highly conserved and hybridization mismatch-tolerant 70mer oligonucleotides (Wang et al. 2002 (Wang et al. , 2003 . An additional problem with this format is that cross-hybridization occurs when two sequences share a high degree of similarity (Kothapalli et al. 2002) . Careful data interpretation is needed to differentiate subtypes of pathogens using spotted microarrays and hybridization patterns. This approach does not produce direct genomic sequence as an output, but requires manual isolation and conventional DNA sequencing of captured pathogen targets (Wang et al. 2003) . Thus, it is obvious that any incorporation of these concepts into a broad-spectrum diagnostic device for hundreds of pathogenic microorganisms and their variants will require a significant reduction in design, processing, and analysis steps. The exponentially increasing availability of microbial sequences makes it possible to envision the use of direct sequence for routine pathogen diagnostics and surveillance; however, this requires that pathogen sequence information be rapidly obtained. \"Resequencing\" microarrays use \"tiled\" sets of 10 5 to 10 6 probes of either 25mers or 29mers, containing one perfectly matched and three mismatched probes per base for both strands of target genes (Hacia 1999) . This array-based format, combined with specific PCR, has proven ideal for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and phylogenetic analysis (Kozal et al. 1996; Gingeras et al. 1998; K. Wilson et al. 2002; W. Wilson et al. 2002; Wong et al. 2004) . Because several types of variations (especially insertion/deletion or frequent multiple substitutions) in pathogen sequence can perturb hybridization patterns, these approaches used differential measures of specific pathogen hybridization patterns to identify individual sequence variants. That is, identifications require a priori knowledge of a differential hybridization pattern that is empirically determined in control experiments. Even when control experiments are carried out, these characteristic and conserved hybridization patterns do not always occur with highly diverse pathogen targets obtained from clinical specimens.",

We chose to use a customdesigned Affymetrix resequencing Respiratory Pathogen Microarray (RPM v.1). Furthermore, we developed a method for automatic assembly of incomplete and disconnected pathogen sequence data into cumulative sequences amenable for similarity-based (e.g., Basic Local Alignment Search Tool-BLAST, Altschul et al. 1990) identification. The combination of a resequencing microarray with the application of statistical metrics to the raw output of the assay can allow unambiguous and reproducible sequence-based pathogen identification from clinical specimens. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for correct species-and strain-level identification with unambiguous statistical interpretation of adenovirus and influenza A strains at clinically relevant sensitivity levels. This report further suggests the feasibility of using this technology for broadspectrum surveillance of respiratory pathogens, while providing new information on the incidence of pathogen coinfection.",

Samples were amplified with either pathogenspecific PCR or random amplification strategies and then hybridized to the arrays. To test whether prototype tile regions could be used for the identification of a broad number of variants without relying on predetermined hybridization patterns, we used febrile respiratory illness (FRI)-causing adenoviruses (HAdV) as our model system. The capability of the RPM v.1 to discriminate HAdV serotypes was tested by interrogating degenerate PCR amplicons (Lin et al. 2004 ) from different HAdV strains that were fully sequenced by members of the Epidemic Outbreak Surveillance (EOS) Consortium. The amplicons were hybridized to the chip, and GDAS software (Affymetrix Inc.) was used to generate sequence calls by comparing the respective hybridization intensities. The parameters of the nucleotide base call algorithm (Cutler et al. 2001) within GDAS were set to allow the maximum number of base calls (Permissive Base Calling Algorithm Setting, Supplemental data). Once generated, the primary nucleotide sequence produced was filtered and subjected to sequence similarity searching using the Respiratory Pathogen Identifier (REPI) software developed by our group. For this report, we examined the results from REPI and counted a sample positive for a specific pathogen if at least one subsequence from the pathogen's prototype tile region produced BLAST returns where the return with lowest expected (E) value was a match for the specific pathogen. E-values from multiple records that have the same score but indicate different strains generate ambiguous strain identification, but could still be unambiguous at the serotype level. This approach allows one or more individual subsequences to be used for pathogen identification without relying on the design of strain-specific probes and hybridization pattern recognition (Gingeras et al. 1998) , and permits highly variable hybridization patterns to produce the same order of sequence rankings.",

Strain-level identification was obtained in all cases except for subgroup B2 strains that were identified only as belonging to that subgroup. In a similar fashion, the remaining tiled regions on the RPM v.1 were successfully validated with the exception of those for West Nile virus. For these validation tests, control laboratory strains (Table 2 ; Supplemental data) were used, except in the case of influenza A virus H5N1 tiled regions.

For DNA targets (e.g., HAdV-4), the isolated total NA from nasal wash or throat swab specimens was first subjected to McrBC enzymatic digestion at methylated CpG sites (Panne et al. 1999 ), reducing the human genomic DNA to a manageable size (\u054510 kb), followed by the subtraction of repetitive sequences using Cot-1 human DNA (Fig. 1) . The remaining DNA was subjected to whole-genome amplification (Lovmar et al. 2003) and routinely allowed full or partial detection of the E1A, hexon, and fiber genes at target concentrations of 10 3 copies/\u00b5L of the starting clinical sample. For RNA pathogen targets, non-human RNA species were enriched by the capture and removal of human 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, and polyadenylatedmRNAs (MICROBEnrich, Ambion Inc.). Subsequent amplification of the enriched RNA, using a modified random reverse transcription PCR from a previously described method (Wang et al. 2002 (Wang et al. , 2003 Kessler et al. 2004 ) led to reproducible detection sensitivities of 2.5 \u202b\u05df\u202c 10 \u202b3\u05de\u202c plaque-forming units/\u00b5L of influenza A virus in previously frozen nasal wash specimens. In comparison to the detection sensitivity without subtraction (adenovirus, 10 6 copies/\u00b5L; influenza A virus, 250 plaque-forming units/\u00b5L of the starting clinical sample), the combination of human NA background subtraction and random amplification of the remaining NA in clinical samples greatly increased the detection sensitivity without multiple amplification steps.",

Visual examination of the hybridization of amplicons from a clinical sample on the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (H1) gene prototype sequence correctly identified the presence of an influenza A virus. Sequence-based REPI analysis revealed the identity of the virus to be most nearly identical to subtype A/Madrid/1082/ 2001, another H1N1 strain that had been circulating during the same flu season as the A/New Caledonia/20/99 vaccine strain. This identification corresponded to identification made based on the sequence obtained using the conventional DNA sequencing.

Using multiplex PCR, 13 out of 13 samples were correctly diagnosed in comparison to the culture method. While using random amplification, 15 out of 18 samples were identified.

Similar BLAST search results were observed from sequences generated for samples in which both random amplification and multiplex PCR were done, further suggesting that random amplification methods correspond well with multiplex PCR (Table 2 ).

This approach not only allows simultaneous detection and differentiation of common circulating respiratory pathogens at clinically relevant sensitivity levels, but also enables us to identify coinfections and rarely encountered or typically unexpected pathogens. This technology does not require a priori knowledge of a differential hybridization pattern for pathogen identification. Thus, it is not necessary to build up a database of reference hybridization patterns through control experiments for differentiating subtypes of pathogens. Also, the false-positive rate caused by cross-hybridization when two sequences share a high degree of similarity was greatly reduced through this approach. In >300 experiments for all validated tiled sequences on the RPM v.1, no false-positive results were obtained when using clinical samples, and no misidentifications were made when using controlled laboratory samples (Table 1 presence of two or more coinfectants, but also identified them correctly at the strain level. In all cases, the interpretation of a pathogen's identity is much more straightforward. While this system demonstrates remarkably low falsepositive rates (a high specificity), the system remains somewhat limited in sensitivity as indicated by the false negatives. The sen-sitivity of the current system can detect adenovirus at target concentrations of 10 3 copies/\u00b5L of the starting clinical sample and influenza A virus at 2.5 \u202b\u05df\u202c 10 \u202b3\u05de\u202c plaque-forming units/\u00b5L using a combination of human NA background subtraction and random amplification of the remaining NA. Due to the use of specific primers and the exponential amplification of PCR, it is not surprising to see that the multiplex PCR is more sensitive than random amplification. Limitations in sensitivity can result in false negatives, especially if a patient is tested early or late in the infection or the pathogen of interest does not typically shed in high titer, such as HAdV or influenza A virus. Our future work will focus on improving assay sensitivity using more complete subtraction of background human DNA and RNA. Nevertheless, this assay may still be useful for some applications. This assay is not yet optimized for detailed strain-level identification, speed (\u223c12-16 h), or cost ($400 per chip, \u223c$20 per pathogen species) relative to that desired for rapid infectious disease diagnostics. Improvements to processing methods (Lin et al. 2004 ) and the use of the next generation of resequencing chips will increase sequence content while substantially decreasing cost and time.",

(For probe tiling information of RPM v.1, see Supplemental Table 1 ). Two pathogens, HAdV and influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1), were treated in much more detail. They were selected based upon recent outbreak information (Erdman et al. 2002; Kolavic-Gray et al. 2002; Thompson et al. 2003) . Based on this, partial sequences from the E1A, hexon, and fiber genes containing diagnostic regions of adenovirus serotypes HAdV-4, HAdV-5, and HAdV-7 were tiled for the detection of all FRI-causing human adenoviruses. Similarly, tiled regions for influenza A virus detection were comprised of partial sequences from the hemagglutinin gene (subtypes H1, H3, and H5), the neuraminidase gene (subtypes N1 and N2), and the matrix gene. In addition to HAdV and influenza A virus, the current RPM design permits discrimination of 12 other common respiratory pathogens, and six Centers for Disease Control and Prevention category A bio-terrorism pathogens (Table 1) known to cause FRI, i.e., \"flu-like\" symptoms at early stage of infection.",

The algorithm first removes control sequences, since they are intended only to indicate correct operation and are specifically designed by Affymetrix to be nonsense sequence; therefore, they will never have relevant returns. Next the sequence is evaluated for subsequences of usable data that will return a significant return from BLAST. A prototype tiled sequence is evaluated starting from the first base call. A window, m bases long, slides along the sequence searching for the first area that scores 25% or better, which is computed by dividing the total of valid bases in the window by the window's length, m (Fig. 4A) . Now that the start of usable data is determined, the program moves the window forward, searching for the location at which the window score is <25%. Once the end of the subsequence is found, beginning and trailing n's are trimmed. Any subsequence <20 nucleotides (nt) is discarded. Subsequences >50 nt are accepted. Subsequences 20-50 nt in length are accepted if the total number of n's in the sequence is \u054560% of the total subsequence length. The evaluation of the sequence continues in this manner, generating as many subsequences as needed to represent all usable data of the sequence. All accepted subsequences are queried against a public database (e.g., GenBank) and other nonpublic sequences using the BLAST algorithm. The output of this program discards subsequences that only have returns with an expected (E) value >1.0 \u202b\u05df\u202c E \u202b9\u05de\u202c and only displays for each subsequence records having an E-value <1.0 \u202b\u05df\u202c E \u202b9\u05de\u202c . Raw BLAST outputs (subsequence length, database identifier, bit score, and E-value) for each parsed subsequence were saved and ranked in order of descending bit scores (Fig. 4B) . In addition, a number of statistics on the subsequence are computed for user analysis, including the subsequence percentage of the target sequence, the subsequence length, the number of subsequence base calls, and the percentage of subsequence base calls.
