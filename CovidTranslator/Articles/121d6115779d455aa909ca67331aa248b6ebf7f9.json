Using our subgenomic DI system, we have studied the effects of sequences flanking the MHV transcription consensus sequence on subgenomic RNA transcription. We obtained the following results. (i) Insertion of a 12-nucleotide-long sequence including the UCUAAAC transcription consensus sequence at different locations of the DI RNA resulted in different efficiencies of subgenomic DI RNA synthesis. (ii) Differences in the amount of subgenomic DI RNA were defined by the sequences that flanked the 12-nucleotide-long sequence and were not affected by the location of the 12-nucleotide-long sequence on the DI RNA. (iii) Naturally occurring flanking sequences of intergenic sequences at gene 6-7, but not at genes 1-2 and 2-3, contained a transcription suppressive element(s). (iv) Each of three naturally occurring flanking sequences of an MHV genomic cryptic transcription consensus sequence from MHV gene 1 also contained a transcription suppressive element(s).

The molar ratio of the genomic to subgenomic sequence could affect transcription by constructing a new series of DI cDNAs with the 12-nt sequence positioned at different sites in DE5-w3; each construct was similar to the others in that they all contained the 0.4-kb inserted region that carried the 12-nt sequence and its upstream and downstream 0.2-kb sequences; each construct differed only in the location of the insertion within the DI genome. We chose the 0.4-kb fragment used for construction of FDI-SpeI, because FDI-SpeI showed the most efficient subgenomic DI RNA transcription (Fig. 4) . We inserted this 0.4-kb fragment at the AflIII, StuI, EagI, SphI, AflII, SacII, and NruI sites of DE5-w3 to produce FDI-AflIII/Sp, FDI-StuI/Sp, FDI-EagI/Sp, FDI-SphI/Sp, FDI-AflII/Sp, FDI-SacII/Sp and FDI-NruI/Sp, respectively (Fig.  5A) .
