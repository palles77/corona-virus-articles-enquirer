Interestingly, surgery had also evolved through four stages of evolution from Surgery 1.0 to Surgery 4.0 roughly around the same periods of time. Although the time periods for the four stages of the two revolutions are not exactly the same, there are a lot of major developments on which these two revolutions are based.",

With remarkable developments in science at that time, production technology, which previously was powered by muscle of men or animals, was replaced by power provided by steam engines. The steam power increased human productivity many times. Further developments in steam-powered ships, or some years later, steam-powered locomotives brought about further massive changes as people and goods can move greater distances within shorter hours.",

            "text": "Starting around the same time, but ending slightly later (18th -20 century) was the first stage of the evolution of Surgery, Surgery 1.0. Although different authors have considered different surgeons to be the father of surgery [1], most would agree that the father of scientific surgery is John Hunter (1728-1793) [2] . This Scottish anatomist, surgeon and pathologist, was well-known to be \"an experimental surgical scientist\". With his introduction of science into surgery, surgery gradually evolved to become a subject of science in the 19th century. At around this time, Joseph Lister (1827-1912) advocated the use of carbolic acid as an antiseptic in surgery. As a result of the marked improvement in surgical outcomes, he was dubbed \"the father of modern surgery\" [3] . Antiseptic surgery gradually evolved into aseptic surgery through the subsequent contributions by many clinicians. Furthermore, pain control during surgery had also developed through the stages of nitrous oxide, ether. chloroform and finally into modern anaesthesia [4] . The availability of blood transfusion through the identification of ABO blood groups, and the preservation of stored blood for transfusion made surgery to become much safer [5] .",

However, patients who underwent the former procedure had fewer postoperative complications and reoperation rates than patients who underwent the latter procedure.

The study found that the former treatment offered the advantages of cost, shorter hospital stay and total anaesthesia time as this treatment prevented the development of recurrent acute cholecystitis which occurred in some patients receiving the latter treatment during the wait for delayed cholecystectomy. The second is a propensity score-matched study on the \"Risk factors and oncological outcome for intravesical recurrence in organ-confined upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma patients after radical nephroureterectomy\". The study found tumor diameters and tumor stage to be independent risk factor of intravesical recurrence in these patients. As these patients had poorer prognosis than those patients without intravesical recurrence, a more active postoperative surveillance and treatment strategies should be adopted for them.",
