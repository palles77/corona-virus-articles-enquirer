For this purpose, we developed specific transfer vectors containing the gene encoding for the highly antigenic structural ASFV protein p54 in which foreign sequences were introduced. DNA sequences encoding continuous linear epitopes, the antigenic site A from foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) VP1 protein and the DA3 antigenic determinant from transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) nucleoprotein N, were separately cloned into the p54 gene, in a region encoding a non-essential domain of the protein. Chimeric p54 genes were inserted by homologous recombination into the thymidine kinase (TK) locus of ASFV genome. The resulting recombinant viruses efficiently expressed both chimeric proteins under transcriptional control of the p54 promoter, and the chimeric gene products were recognized by antibodies to both p54 and foreign epitopes. The modified p54 proteins were also found in the viral particles and complemented the function of the wild-type p54, since deletion of the p54 gene from recombinant viruses did not affected virus replication in Vero cells. This work demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of incorporating foreign amino acid sequences (up to 18 residues) into a protein component of the ASFV particle without affecting virus viability.",

Dixon, pers. comm.), is a large DNA virus which infects species of the Suidae family and soft ticks of the Ornithodoros genus [22, 24] . It was previously shown that the genome of ASFV, a double-stranded DNA molecule, can accept foreign sequences by homologous recombination [17] . This fact was further extended with the construction of plasmid vectors for the generation of deletion mutant viruses or viruses expressing foreign reporter genes [2, 6, 7, 13, 19] . Recently, it was possible to attenuate a virulent strain of ASFV by specific elimination of a viral gene. Animals immunized with the attenuated virus survived the lethal challenge with the homologous virulent virus [26] . The feasibility of manipulating the ASFV genome and its restricted host range makes reasonable to explore the use of ASFV as a swine vector when the incoming information about the genes involved in virulence and pathogenesis allows the stable attenuation of the virus and, consequently, a safer use of such vector.",

Accordingly to its highly immunogenic character, p54 induces neutralizing antibodies during virus infection [8] , in agreement with more recent data regarding the functionality of this polypeptide as one of the virus attachment proteins [9] . Furthermore, it has been shown that the p54 gene suffers rearrangements within the coding region without affecting virus viability [18, 21] . These rearrangements produce alterations in the number of copies of the P A A A tetrapeptide present in p54, thus resulting in stepwise modifications in the molecular weight of this protein which are dispensable for virus replication in cell culture.",

            "text": "The study of p54 heterogeneity proved that differences in size displayed after adaptation of ASFV to growth in cell culture [1] consisted of changes in the number of copies of an imperfect direct repeat formed by 12 nucleotides coding for a PAAA tetrapeptide [18, 21] . Wild type and low passage viruses contained only two repeats while one to more than four copies were found in highly passaged viruses. These alterations in the number of PAAA blocks produced stepwise changes in the electrophoretic mobility of p54. Nevertheless, all p54 species were functional since they were specified by single virus clones and incorporated to the viral particle without affecting virus morphogenesis [18] . We took advantage of the occurrence of these dispensable repetitions to introduce foreign sequences between two consecutive PAAA motifs. The coding sequence for the three alanine residues provided for a NotI restriction endonuclease recognition site, thus facilitating the insertion of foreign sequences into the p54 coding region (Fig. 1) . Following this approach we generated plasmids containing modified p54 genes including either the site A epitope from FMDV VP1 or the DA3 epitope from TGEV nucleoprotein N. Subsequent generation of recombinant viruses with modified p54 proteins was achieved in a two-step process (Fig. 2) as reported [19] . The first step involved the insertion of the chimeric p54 gene together with a reporter gene, \u2424-glucuronidase (\u2424-gus), into the thymidine kinase locus of the ASFV genome. In the second step, the wild-type copy of the p54 gene was disrupted by the insertion of a second reporter gene, \u2424-galactosidase (\u2424-gal), into the genome of \u2424-gus expressing viruses, generated after the first homologous recombination.",

An inmunorreactive band of approximately 26 kDa corresponding to chimeric protein p54/site A was readily detected using both specific anti-p54 serum and monoclonal antibody SD6 (Fig. 3B) . Thus, incorporation of the 18 amino acid site A epitope generated a p54 chimeric protein that increased in 1 kDa the relative molecular mass observed in wild-type ASFV-infected cells. In contrast, incorporation of the 12 amino acid DA3 epitope from nucleoprotein N into p54 increased the relative molecular mass of the wild-type protein in about (Fig. 3A) . These differences in molecular mass of p54 after incorporation of foreign epitopes were not due to incorporation of repetitive copies of DA3 epitope into the p54. Sequence analysis of the plasmid constructs used for homologous recombination with the parental viruses demonstrated that only one copy of the sequence encoding for each epitope was inserted into the p54 gene. Postransductional modifications of chimeric p54 proteins incorporated to the ASFV genomes, that may account for the altered molecular mass observed with DA3 epitope, were not analyzed. Importantly, the antigenicity of p54 after incorporation of the foreign epitopes was not substantially altered since a monospecific antiserum reacted with chimeric proteins similarly as it did with wild-type p54.",

Genetic manipulation of ASFV can be achieved by homologous recombination with a similar efficiency to that routinely obtained for vaccinia virus [17] . Therefore, and as a first step in the development of an ASFV derived vector, we have designed a method to incorporate foreign sequences into the ASFV particle. Three ASFV strains were genetically modified to produce chimeric p54 proteins carrying two different foreign viral epitopes. These chimeric proteins were expressed in cells infected by recombinant viruses at lower level than wild-type p54. This difference in protein expression could be due to the localization of the gene copy in the virus genome, since chimeric p54 was expressed under the control of the same promoter than original p54. Chimeric p54 proteins were efficiently incorporated to the virus particle either when the virus expressed both wild-type and chimerical p54 protein simultaneously or the modified version of the protein alone. The proportion of p54 form incorporated to the virus particle was proportional to their relative abundance in infected cells. The generated recombinant viruses were stable at least after 10 consecutive passages in cell culture and did not present significant alterations in virus yields with respect to parental viruses.",

Since subpopulations with p54 proteins of more than 35 kDa have been described [1] , corresponding approximately to a 40 amino acids repetition [18] , the possibility of introducing foreign sequences of more than 20 amino acids containing multiple epitopes remains opened and should be further studied. In addition, several copies of chimeric p54 proteins containing foreign epitopes from different swine pathogens could be probably incorporated into the same viral particle, since wild-type and chimeric p54 proteins were incorporated to the virions in single recombinant viruses. Finally, since p54 is one of the most antigenic ASFV proteins, it is reasonable to speculate about the possibility that cloned epitopes could enhance its own antigenicity when they are associated with p54.",
