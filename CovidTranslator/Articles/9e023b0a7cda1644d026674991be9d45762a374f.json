A comparison drawn between the simulated and experimentally attained spectra by FT-Raman and FT-IR showed concurrence. The natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis enabled in comprehending the stability and charge delocalization in the title molecule. The first hyperpolarizability which is an important parameter for future studies of nonlinear optics (NLO) was calculated to check the potential of the molecule to be an NLO material. Besides, frontier molecular orbitals (FMO), electron localization function (ELF) and localized orbital locator (LOL) analysis were performed. Energy gap (\u0394E), electronegativity (\u03c7), chemical potential (\u03bc), global hardness (\u03b7), softness (S), Mulliken population analysis on atomic charges and thermodynamic properties of the title compound at different temperatures have been calculated. The local reactive properties of PIDAA have been addressed by MEP and ALIE surfaces, together with bond dissociation energy for hydrogen abstraction (H-BDE). MD simulations have been used in order to identify atoms with pronounced interactions with water molecules. The pharmaceutical potential of PIDAA has been considered by the analysis of drug likeness parameters and molecular docking procedure. The biological activity of the molecule in terms of molecular docking has been analyzed theoretically for the treatment of SARS and minimum binding energy calculated. The Ramachandran plot was used to check the stereochemistry of the protein structure. In addition, a comparison of the physiochemical parameters of PIDAA and commercially available drugs (Yu et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2004; Elshabrawy et al., 2014; Chu et al., 2004; Gopal Samy and Xavier, 2015) were carried out.",

            "text": "2-[N-(carboxymethyl)anilino] acetic acid, with two symmetrically situated carboxylic acid groups (polyamino carboxylic acid), is a surface-active tertiary aryl amine. The presence of its iminodiacetic acid structure makes it acidic (pK 1 = 2.5) in nature. With two fused, five membered chelate rings the iminodiacetate anion can act as a tridentate ligand to form a metal complex [6] . It also is an important entity to carry out the hepatobiliary (HIDA) scan which is an imaging technique used to detect problems of the liver. PIDAA, in particular, has various applications associated with it. By the acid-amine complexation mechanism, PIDAA acid is expected to be proficient in triggering the polymerization of carboxylic acid monomers [7, 8] . The tertiary aryl amine structure of PIDAA makes it a prospective photochemical and chemical polymerization accelerator. By employing a diazotation reaction phenyl-iminodiacetic acid groups were covalently grafted onto multi-walled carbon nanotubes and it behaved as a valuable solid-phase extraction [9] . In addition, it is also used for Serve Acute Respiratory Syndrome Treatment (SARS). SARS is a viral respiratory disease caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which leads to upper-respiratory tract illnesses [10, 11] . Theoretically, it was found that PIDAA docks itself to the crystal structure of human Angiotensin converting enzyme 4APH [12] and behaves as a possible treatment for SARS. Organic molecules that have the ability to act as pharmaceutical drugs can be analyzed for their relationship between structural and biological parameters. This can be devised by correlating the biological activity of the selected compounds with computable physiochemical parameters [13] .",

Dunning's basis set (aug-cc-pVDZ) has also been chosen apart from the regular basis set and implemented in various DFT methods. Computational techniques within the frameworks of DFT calculations and MD simulations provide outstanding tools for complementing experimental findings and understanding the reactivity of various molecular structures [14] [15] [16] [17] .

For calculations of bond dissociation energies for hydrogen abstraction (H-BDE), a 6-311G(d,p) basis set was used. MD simulations have been performed by using the OPLS3 force field [32, [38] [39] [40] . Simulation time was set to 10 ns, temperature to 300 K, the pressure to 1.0325 bar and cut-off radius to 12 \u00c5. The modeling of MD systems was performed by placing the one molecule of PIDAA to the simulation box with around 3000 water molecules. The system was considered as isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble, while the simple point charge (SPC) model [35] was used for the treatment of solvent. Maestro program was used for calculations of drug likeness parameters. Drug likeness parameters have been calculated for PIDAA, in order to evaluate its pharmaceutical potential. Frequently used drug likeness parameters in this study encompassed: number of rotatable bonds, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors (HBD and HBA, respectively), AlogP, polar surface area (PSA) and molar refractivity.",

MEP surface indicates the abundance or the excess of electrons at certain molecular sites, while ALIE surface indicates molecular sites where electrons require the lowest amount of energy to be removed. ALIE is defined as the sum of orbital energies weighted by the orbital densities [54, 61] and according to its interpretation, it is a better descriptor than MEP, when it comes to the identification molecular sites sensitive towards the electrophilic attacks. MEP and ALIE surfaces of PIDAA have been presented in Fig. 3 . MEP and ALIE surfaces identify two different regions as possibly sensitive towards the electrophilic attacks. MEP surface recognizes oxygen atoms (double bonded to carbon atoms) as molecular sites with the lowest MEP values, and therefore as sensitive towards the electrophilic attacks. On the other side, ALIE surface recognizes nitrogen atom and benzene ring carbon atoms as molecular sites where the electrons are least tightly bonded, indicating the sensitivity of these locations to electrophilic attacks as well. MEP surface indicates that the hydrogen atoms of the OH groups are characterized by the highest MEP and therefore should be sensitive towards the nucleophilic attacks.

Due to the strong electron-acceptor ability of the electron-acceptor group, the LUMO has higher stability leading to low HOMO-LUMO band gap. The calculated energy values are presented in Table 6 which reveals the chemical reactivity of title compound and proves the occurrence of eventual charge transfer within the molecule. The molecule is not very hard owing to the chemical hardness (2.375) with strong energy transformation [65] . The toxicity of the title molecule is substantially low due to low softness value (0.210). Electrophilicity index is one of the crucial Conceptual Density Functional Theory (CDFT) based descriptor used to study bio-activities [66] . The sufficiently high value of the electrophilicity index (2.294) acts as a precursor to analyzing the title molecule for its biological activity in terms of molecular docking where the title compound PIDAA is the ligand and is docked to a suitable protein.",

Thus, TDOS, PDOS and COOP were calculated and created by convoluting the MO information with Gaussian curves. The fragment orbitals contributing to the MO were majorly by the C\\ \\O orbitals followed by the O\\ \\H, N\\ \\C and least by the C\\ \\H. The overlap on C\\ \\H with O\\ \\H (very weak) and N\\ \\C with C\\ \\O (medium) is due to the positive overlap population (bonding interactions) while the overlap on N\\ \\C with O\\ \\H (very weak), C\\ \\H with C\\ \\O (strong) and C\\ \\H with N\\ \\C (very strong) is due to the negative overlap population (anti-bonding interactions). A correlation is drawn been the trends associated with the HOMO-LUMO gap with charge transfer that occurs as a consequence of the first three excitations. The Multiwfn [67] [68] [69] program has been employed to reconnoiter the charge transfer (CT) due to the first excitation by examining electron density variation [70] . In addition, the calculation of \u0394r index [71] is a quantitative indicator of electron excitation mode. The initial calculations show that the excitation mode 1, 2 and 3 possess a strong probability to exhibit Charge Transfer excitation or Rydberg character since the values of \u0394r are N2.0 \u00c5. However final conclusions can be made only after the visualization of the electron and hole distribution. On visualization, it was observed that the result generated by the medium quality grid for the integral of the hole (0.9700), electron (0.9697) and transition density (\u22480) lie in concurrence with the ideal values. The distance between the centroid of hole and electron is a measure of CT length. The considerably small value indicates the shorter length for the charge transfers. The RMSD of hole distribution that provides an insight into the distribution breadth shows it is much broader in X direction in comparison to the Y and Z direction. The t index that measures the extent of separation between the hole and electron in the title compound shows negative values along the X, Y and Z direction. The distribution of hole, electron and both simultaneously are shown in Fig. 6 (at default isovalue 0.002). It can be observed that there is a spatial separation between the hole-electron distribution thus indicating charge transfer. From the output, we can see that the integral of overlap of hole-electron distribution (S) is 0.2907 for transition mode 1 which is greater when compared to transition mode 3 (0.1288). The distance between the centroid of hole and electron (D) for mode 3 (2.3487 \u00c5) which is larger when compared to that of mode 1 (0.9981 \u00c5). These quantitative data show that transition mode 3 has conspicuously stronger CT character than mode 1.",

In the IR spectrum, a broad intense band observed at 3423 cm \u22121 , is assigned to OH stretching vibration, and its intensity is less than that of free OH vibration due to the existence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Theoretically, the stretching vibrations are observed at 3611(O15-H26) and 3603 (O11-H23) cm \u22121 . The in-plane OH deformations appear in the region 1440-1260 cm \u22121 [74] .

Theoretically, vibrations are observed at 1750 and 1741 cm \u22121 with significant PED contribution.

It was observed that high value occurs between the carbon atoms in the phenyl ring while the values are higher between the boundary carbon atoms in the ring with the hydrogen atom. This is because of the overlap of the sp. orbital of carbon with the s orbital of the hydrogen which is electronically more stable. By examining the value of the carbon and nitrogen atom (C2-N1) the bonding is considerably weaker with the lowest value between N1-C9. This observation can be substantiated from the NBO output where the stabilization energy between the nitrogen and carbon atoms is low. Furthermore, an n-\u03c3* anomeric effect is expected between the lone pair on the carbonyl oxygen atom [89] . This leads to a deformation of the ELF distribution around the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group as observed in Fig. 9 . By examining ELF values of oxygen along the carboxylic acid group, values were lower (represented by blue). The electrons in the bonds between the carbon carbon atoms showed localization (represented by red region) in comparison to the electrons in the bonds between carbon hydrogen (represented by green region).",

Hyperconjugative interactions in NBO analysis support intramolecular nature of hydrogen bonding and charge transfer interactions where the electron donating from LP(2)O15 \u2192 \u03c0* (C12-O14) showed a maximum stabilization of 48.65 kJ/mol. The polar (\u03b8) and azimuthal (\u0278) angles of the vector from the nucleus along with the deviation angle were used to specify the direction of a hybrid. The atomic charge calculations of the PIDAA showed O10 atom has the highest value of \u22120.269 e which is mainly due to the polar nature of the carbonyl group. Solid state UV spectroscopic analysis indicated \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* and n \u2192 \u03c0* transitions of PIDAA with an energy gap of 4.536 eV in the third excited state. The chemical hardness (2.375) specified compound stability, low chemical softness (0.210) signified non-toxicity while the electrophilicity index (2.294) was a descriptor of biological activeness of PIDAA. The molecular structure of PIDAA was ascertained by using FT-IR and FT-Raman spectroscopic studies and vibrational assignments were analyzed. ELF studies showed the stronger chemical bonding between CH bonds due to the overlap of the sp. orbital of carbon with the s orbital of the hydrogen which is electronically more stable. MEP surface identifies oxygen atoms to be sensitive towards the electrophilic attacks, while ALIE surface identifies nitrogen atom and carbon atoms of the benzene ring to be sensitive towards the electrophilic attacks. DFT calculations indicate sensitivity towards the autoxidation mechanism, since H-BDE values of 6 hydrogen atom are having values lower than 85 kcal/mol. Maltose as the excipient can improve the bioactivity of the drug. The pharmaceutical potential of PIDAA is also indicated by the representative values of drug likeness parameters. The low stabilization energy as observed from the NBO results between the carbon nitrogen bonds was reflected as comparatively low values in the LOL figure and a distortion between the N1-C9 atoms. The biological activity of the molecule in terms of molecular docking has been analyzed theoretically for the treatment of SARS and minimum binding energy of \u22126.66 kcal/mol calculated.",
