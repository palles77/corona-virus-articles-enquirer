Our theoretical framework builds on a continuous time Markov chain with four states: healthy without infection, sick, healthy after recovery or after infection but without symptoms and dead. Our quantitative solution matches the number of sick individuals up to the most recent observation and ends with a share of sick individuals following from infection rates and sickness probabilities. We employ this framework to study inter alia the expected peak of the number of sick individuals in a scenario without public regulation of social contacts. We also study the e\u00a4ects of public regulations. For all scenarios we report the expected end of the CoV-2 epidemic.",

Second, predictions about the duration and level of the epidemic must strongly distinguish between the o\u00a2 cially reported numbers (Robert Koch Institut, RKI) and actual numbers of sick individuals. Third, given the current (scarce) medical knowledge about long-run infection rate and individual risks to turn sick, any prediction on the length (duration in months) and strength (e.g. maximum numbers of sick individuals on a given day) is subject to a lot of uncertainty. Our predictions therefore o\u00a4er robustness analyses that provide ranges on how long the epidemic will last and how strong it will be. Fourth, public interventions that are already in place and that are being discussed can lead to more and less severe outcomes of the epidemic. If an intervention takes place too early, the epidemic can actually be stronger than with an intervention that starts later. Interventions should therefore be contingent on current infection rates in regions or countries. of the modelling initiative of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Epidemiologie for comments and discussions.

Our biggest debt of gratitude is owed to Matthias Birkner who has been advising and teaching us on stochastic models for many years.",

Yet, there is a need for more knowledge about objective information and reliable predictions of how the pandemic will likely evolve in the months to come. How large is the risk of any individual to get infected on a particular day or within a week? How does this risk change over time? How large is the expected number of individuals ever infected and how large is the number of individuals infected at any point in time? The latter question is the main concern of the public, politicians and health practitioners to ensure su\u00a2 cient provision of health services. Finally, what are the e\u00a4ects of policy interventions that are already implemented and that are being discussed? This paper starts by describing what we know quantitatively about the spread of the Corona epidemic in the Chinese province of Hubei and in South Korea. This o\u00a4ers insights from two episodes of epidemics that seem to be coming to an end and that help in making predictions for other countries. We then compare the time-series evidence from Hubei and South Korea with cross-sectional information in European countries.",

We start from individuals that can be in four states: healthy (the initial state, state 1), infected and sick (state 2), infected and recovered or infected and never having displayed symptoms (state 3) and dead (state 4). Individuals move between these states with endogenous transition rates that depend on population characteristics. This model allows to make predictions, inter alia, about all the quantities of interest that appeared in the questions raised initially. We apply this model to Germany. We choose parameter values such that the time series of the number of sick (and reported) individuals in Germany since 24 February is matched by our model. Our data source is the Robert Koch Institute (RKI, 2020) . In order to predict the future evolution, we build on various evidence from epidemiology like individual sickness probability and long-run infection rates of the population as a whole. We emphasize the scarce medical and statistical knowledge on these parameters. Any predictions therefore must be subject to large variations. We therefore undertake robustness checks with respect to our central parameters.",

The economic costs of COVID-19 are huge and seem to be larger than those of the \u2026nancial crisis starting in 2007. 4 This paper provides a model that allows to understand the spread of the disease. We employ a model in the tradition of search and matching models originating from Diamond (1982) , Mortensen (1982) and Pissarides (1985) . The basic structure of these models (continuous time Markov chains) is identical to epidemiological models (as becomes clear very quickly when reading overviews like e.g. Hethcote, 2000) . Compared to standard search and matching models, we do allow for four states, however. We extend the typical matching framework from a technical perspective by taking the stochastic nature of transitions and their prediction for the probability to be in various states into account. These probabilities are described by forward Kolmogorov equations. As we work with a discrete number of states, we obtain an ordinary di\u00a4erential equation system. 5 The conclusion discusses various next steps that should be undertaken to understand economic consequences of COVID-19 better. We believe that our framework can form the basis for an understanding of economic costs of the pandemic.",

We afterwards look at South Korea and very brie \u2021y at Japan. We focus on the evolution of the number of individuals that were ever reported to be sick during the current epidemic. This number, by construction, can only rise. We chose Hubei and South Korea as the epidemics seem to come to an end in these countries. Given the huge uncertainty about long-run infection rates and individual risk to get sick after an infection with CoV-2, we consider the long-run ratios of sick reported individuals to the overall population a benchmark that allows us to judge the credibility of our predictions for Germany. We are aware that we compare very di\u00a4erent countries with very di\u00a4erent cultural and political habits and medical systems. For reference, we also look at a cross section of infections for European countries. See the appendix for a description of data sources. 6 Hubei Since the onset of the outbreak in the Hubei province in China, the number of con\u2026rmed cases has risen dramatically, peaking at 67,801 (WHO Situation Reports, 2020). 7 Reporting began in January 2020 and we note that in mid-February, the WHO changed its classi\u2026cation methodology by reporting both clinically and lab con\u2026rmed cases rather than only lab con\u2026rmed cases. In terms of cumulative numbers, the total reported cases of infected individuals rose 4 Eichenbaum et al. (2020) study the e\u00a4ects of the CoV-2 epidemic on economic decisions of households. They emphasize the household decisions to reduce labour supply exacerbate the recessionary e\u00a4ects of the epidemic. They apply their model to the US. Barro et al. (2020) employ mortalities and economic consequences of the \"Spanish Flu\" to provide estimates of the world wide consequences of COVID19. They do not o\u00a4er a detailed projection for Germany. The costs for Germany are estimated by Dorn et al. (2020) . Atkeson (2020) provides esitmates of economic consequences of COVID19 for the US. 5 When working with continuous states like e.g. wealth or labour income, partial di\u00a4erential equations result.

It is identical to the curve in \u2026gure 5. The shut down from (16) which re \u2021ects the planned closing of schools in Germany until mid April is drawn as the green curve. It reduces the rise of the number of sick individuals until mid April. Afterwards, the number of sick individuals will rise more quickly again. The peak is reached in June and this peak is lower than the one without the shut down. In this respect the shut down is a good policy measure. When the shut down is extended (the black curve), the peak is further shifted to the right and also smaller. 20 Quantitatively speaking, the shut down prolongs the epidemic in terms of its end as de\u2026ned by t new 100 also employed in table 3 (100 or fewer new incidences are reported per day). For the shut down currently in place and for the delayed shut down, the end is beginning of July. For the longer shut down, the end is beginning of August. Concerning the peak demands on the health system, the shut down as currently in place, and also an extended shut down, hardly have any e\u00a4ect.

In particular, wherever available the data from the nCoV-2019 Group is used instead of the data from the WHO, in an e\u00a4ort to remain as consistent as possible by using only one source at a time.
