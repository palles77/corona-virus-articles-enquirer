            "text": "Purpose: To assess lung lesions in patients with pneumonia complicating novel influenza A (H1N1) by serial high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) during the early, progressive and convalescent stages. Samples and methods: Serial HRCT scans in 39 patients with pneumonia complicating novel influenza A (H1N1) were reviewed for predominant patterns of lung abnormalities as well as distribution and extent of involvement. Longitudinal changes were assessed at different time points. Results: In the early stage, the most common HRCT finding was patchy ground-glass opacity (GGO) (n \u00bc 4, 54.7%). In the progressive stage, bilaterally distributed GGO mixed with consolidation was the most commonly observed feature (n \u00bc 28, 71.8%). The diffuse pattern deteriorated to a peak (n \u00bc 17, 43.6%) at this stage. In the convalescent stage, the most common finding was fibrosis (n \u00bc 25, 64.1%). Averagely, fibrosis was observed at d 18.5 \u00b1 6.4 after the onset of symptoms. Three patterns of longitudinal changes of the lesions were observed, including: type 1, improvement after deterioration; type 2, concurrent improvement and deterioration followed by improvement; and type 3, gradual improvement. Type 1 was the more common pattern (n \u00bc 27, 69.2%). Complete serial HRCT scans from initial and final scan were obtained in 24 patients, and the mean CT score peaked at d 8e14 of the illness. Conclusion: HRCT may play a role in detecting and characterizing pulmonary lesions for the cases of pneumonia complicating influenza A. In addition, it may contribute to monitoring longitudinal changes of pneumonia and assessing therapeutic response.",

Although initial reports suggested that the condition associated with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in 2009 might be milder compared to the influenza pandemic in 1918, characteristic clinical data and high-risk populations of its complications are still of great clinical significance [2] . The most common clinical findings of H1N1 virus infection include fever, cough, dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia, and headache. In most cases, the symptoms are mild and self-limited. However, a small percentage of patients with influenza A (H1N1) develop severe pneumonia that may progress into respiratory failure that occasionally requires mechanical ventilation, and even death [3e5] .",

Bilateral, multifocal or diffuse consolidation, often associated with GGOs, is the predominant CT finding in patients with more severe clinical condition of influenza infection [8, 9] . Thin-section CT, particularly highresolution CT (HRCT), in the documentation of parenchymal abnormalities in influenza A (H1N1) when chest radiographs demonstrate normal or only questionable abnormalities has also been established. CT also facilitates assessing complications and providing evidence of mixed pulmonary infections in patients who fail to respond to appropriate therapy [10] . Limited data are available, however, on sequential CT findings during the subsequent course of influenza A (H1N1), especially regarding sequelae that may occur during convalescence [11, 12] . Thin-section CT evidence of fibrosis during the convalescent stage has recently been reported in patients with influenza A (H1N1) [12] . Thus, the purpose of our study was to evaluate the lung parenchymal abnormalities in patients with influenza A (H1N1) by serial HRCT scans at the early, progressive and convalescent stages of the disease.",

All patients with clinically proven pneumonia complicating influenza A (H1N1) who were admitted to the Clinical Center of Public Health in Shanghai, China between July 2009 and March 2011 were enrolled as the subjects of the study. All of the patients underwent at least three serial HRCT chest scans. Specifically, a total of 39 patients (aged 19e78 years with a mean of 42.2 years), including 27 males and 12 females, participated in the research. Their diagnoses of pneumonia complicating influenza A (H1N1) were defined by the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China. Oropharyngeal and/or nasopharyngeal specimens of all patients were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), all of which showing positive to H1N1 virus strain. To avoid unnecessary exposure to radiation, HRCT should be reserved for patients whose diagnosis is uncertain or for patients with clinical deterioration that requires further evaluation of lung abnormalities. For patients with highly suspected concurrent infections, additional microbiological examinations for other viral, bacterial and fungal infections are recommended. All patients experienced fever with a body temperature of above 38 C, tachypnea, and cough. Other common symptoms included generalized weakness (n \u00bc 18, 46.2%) and headache (n \u00bc 9, 23.1%). Preexisting medical conditions were reported in 19 (48.7%) patients, including pregnancy (n \u00bc 2, 5.1%), primary hypertension (n \u00bc 12, 30.8%), chronic hepatitis B (n \u00bc 2, 5.1%), ankylosing spondylitis (n \u00bc 1, 2.6%), lymphoma (n \u00bc 1, 2.6%), and type II diabetes (n \u00bc 1, 2.6%). All the patients received neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir), while 21 (53.8%) also received corticosteroids. Mechanical ventilation was performed for 12 (30.8%) patients.

Consolidation was defined as homogeneous opacification of the parenchyma that obscured the underlying vessels. Parenchymal band was defined as non-tapering linear opacity that was several millimeters thick and several centimeters long. Reticular opacity was defined as linear opacities arranged into a network. The presence of a parenchymal band, reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis, or irregular interfaces (bronchovascular, pleural, or mediastinal) was considered to be evidence of fibrosis [13] . On the scans, the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy (defined as a lymph node with 1 cm short-axis diameter), pneumothorax, and pleural effusion was also noted. The distribution of abnormalities was categorized as focal, multifocal, and diffuse. A focal distribution was defined as a singular focus of abnormality.

During d 8e14, all 39 patients presented with multifocal or diffuse lesions in both lungs, and some of the diffuse lesions further progressed to a peak (n \u00bc 17, 43.6%). Consolidation with or without GGO was the most common HRCT finding (n \u00bc 28, 71.8%).

In our study, superimposed bacterial or fungal infection of the respiratory tract was observed in 3 patients. Viral pneumonia complicated by a secondary infection presents a challenge in therapy choosing. For the cases with cavitation by HRCT, the condition may progress due to co-infection, such as aspergillus or staphylococcal septicemia, which indicates appropriate treatment. In addition, diffusely confluent air-space opacities with both lungs involved by HRCT may be indicative of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [18] . ARDS may be present with respiratory epithelial injury with abnormally increased permeability of the capillary endothelium that initially produces patchy GGOs on HRCT and further evolves to confluent bilateral air-space opacity. In our study, the pattern was exhibited in 4 patients with ARDS.",

These findings indicated that persistent lung abnormalities in patients with pneumonia complicating influenza A (H1N1) may suggest the development of fibrosis, although GGOs or consolidations are largely reversible in such cases. In the present study, the lesions in 5 patients (12.8%) resolved completely, while signs of fibrosis were observed in 25 patients (64.1%). Fibrosis was observed averagely at d 18.5 \u00b1 6.4 after the onset of symptoms. The patients who were detected signs of fibrosis were observed to recover over time. These findings are in agreement to those by Li et al. [12] , who reported serial CT scans of 70 patients with influenza A after treatment. In their report, fibrosis developed in the first week and peaked at the third week. Thereafter, the lesion began to decrease slowly. Pathologically, fibrosis can be observed at the later stages of influenza A infection [19, 20] . Gill et al. [21] described the pathological findings of lungs after autopsy of 34 death cases from influenza A (H1N1) infection. They reported that 2 had fibrosis, with an average hospitalization for 31.5 days. As far as we know, fibrosis is caused by activated fibroblast and deposited collagen [18] ; and lung lesion, correlated with a restrictive defect, is characterized by a reticular appearance, parenchymal distortion and traction bronchiectasis mostly with ventral distribution. It is worth noting that residual fibrosis in 1 patient of our study remained in the basal and peripheral lung regions at d 97. And the finding resembles to that in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Patients with SARS have been demonstrated with pulmonary fibrosis 6 months after the initial diagnosis by thin-section CT scanning [22, 23] .",

However, in our study, the duration of disease was longer than those reported by Yuan et al. And the longitudinal changes of lung abnormalities in our study were different and complex. The group of patients in our study more likely represents severe condition of pneumonia complicating influenza A (H1N1), which is more common in individuals with concomitant chronic disease. In the present study, 19 patients (48.7%) reported preexisting medical conditions. The longitudinal changes of lung lesions demonstrated by serial HRCT can be divided into 3 types: improvement after deterioration, improvement and deterioration followed by improvement, and gradual improvement. And the type of improvement after deterioration is the most common (n \u00bc 27, 69.2%). Totally, 24 patients did not miss any HRCT scans, showing marked deterioration of the lesions at d 8e14 by a peak of estimated mean CT score during this period as well as slow improvement thereafter. Li et al. reported similar findings, but they failed to classify the longitudinal changes of the lung lesions [12] .
