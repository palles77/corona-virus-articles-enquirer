In the United States, about 5% of women and 10% of men are affected in their lifetimes, with recurrence rates approaching 50% in 10 years. Annual costs exceed 1.8 billion dollars. Although most stones pass spontaneously, some patients require hospitalization for parenteral pain control, intravenous hydration, severe obstruction, or infection. For emergency physicians, management is usually less an issue than diagnosis because the differential for flank pain is diverse and includes other entities with high morbidity and mortality, such as aortic aneurysms and dissections, pancreatitis, and colitis including ischemia, appendicitis, and pyelonephritis. As technology has advanced, spiral computed axial tomography scan has replaced other modalities for diagnosing urinary tract stones because of its high sensitivity and its ability to visualize other intra-abdominal pathology. The radiation dose is not trivial, however, and given the recurrence rates of nephrolithiasis, many practitioners continue to use urinalysis as a screening tool for kidney stones. Researchers have recently published studies showing that hematuria is not a positive predictor for urinary tract stones, and our data appear congruent with their findings. This study is limited by several factors. The sample size is small but the results are clear and consistent with other studies. Selection bias is a problem too. In this study, a retrospective medical record review was done, selecting for positive scan results then including patients with a documented urinalysis, which excluded some patients, especially younger patients presenting with \"typical\" recurrent pain and hematuria, thus Study objectives: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first assessment of a urine trypsinogen bedside test in the diagnosis of pancreatitis in the emergency department (ED) using a non-Scandinavian population.",

Study objectives: In fiscal year 1995, 148,000 US citizens died and 2.6 million were hospitalized for more than 1 week, at a loss of $260 billion, from trauma-, sepsis-, and burn-related syndromes. This mortality and morbidity rate is dramatically reduced from 30 years ago because of improved patient transportation and resuscitation but includes no reduction in morbidity and mortality of patients surviving the initial resuscitation rate. These patients are still developing systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) at the same rate, despite multiple clinical ICU-based trials of single-agent biologic response modifiers. To date, therapy directed to prevent or improve MODS/SIRS by modulating the host's endogenous inflammatory response has had only limited success. Only a finite window of time may exist in which treatments for prevention of posttrauma MODS will be therapeutic. Postinjury monocyte (M\u03c6) activation and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6) and other mediators are repeatedly linked to development of MODS. Concomitantly, to these aberrant inflammatory responses, depressed M\u03c6 immunostimulatory cytokine production and diminished antigen presenting function occur in MODS. This seemingly paradoxic overactivation and depressed activation of trauma patients' M\u03c6 results from an unbalanced M\u03c6 differentiation toward inflammatory macrophage (Mac) and away from immunostimulatory dendritic cells (DC) . Alterations in M\u03c6 differentiation capacity have been linked to altered posttrauma M\u03c6 receptor expression and consequent altered signal transduction, as well as aberrant M\u03c6 gene activation. In particular, endogenous prostaglandin (EP) E 2 (PGE 2 ) stimulation alters M\u03c6 receptors. There is differential expression and disparate activation of the EP 1/3 versus EP 2/4 subtypes of PGE 2 receptors on M\u03c6. High and low PGE 2 levels differentially activate EP 1/3 versus EP 2/4 . These EP receptors' different signaling pathways could differentially affect M\u03c6 functions, differentiation patterns, and receptor expression. Evidence suggests that altered EP receptor signaling may affect the expression of toll-like receptors (TLR2/4), which control M\u03c6 responses to bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. We hypothesized that early increases in posttrauma PGE 2 levels alter M\u03c6 EP receptor expression and M\u03c6 TLR expression, as well as M\u03c6 differentiation receptor expression, leading to increased inflammatory Mac responses and decreased differentiation to immunostimulatory DC. We further postulated that these EP receptor changes may occur in the first hours after injury when patients are in the emergency department.",

Mac and iDC were generated from fresh M\u03c6 by using macrophage colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor/IL-4, respectively. These M\u03c6, Mac, and iDC were also stimulated with high-dose (10 -6 ) and low-dose (10 -8 ) PGE 2 . Isolated M\u03c6/Mac/immunostimulatory dendritic cells (iDC) and EP 1-4 and TLR2/4 receptor expression was then assessed by 4-color flow cytometry on a dual-laser BD flow cytometer. The following markers were used for the various cell subtypes: M\u03c6 (CD66b, CD11c, CD33, and CD14), Mac (CD64, CD163, CD14 and MRP14/8), and iDC (CD86, CD209, CD14, CD1a) by using the fluorescent labels fluorescein isothiocyanate, phycoerythrin, peridin chlorophyll protein, and antigen presenting cell, which each emit in a distant spectrum. The cells were concomitantly stained with the aforementioned EP 1-4 and TLR 2/4 receptors by using a biotinstrepavidin indirect label to amplify the marker expression and to tag the antibodies not easily directly fluorochrome labeled. Appropriate isotype antibodies served as controls.

Caterpillars are not expensive, are easy to raise, and require little space. In addition, their use in the laboratory is not regulated by the National Institutes of Health.

A product of gram-negative bacteria, endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] ), stimulates macrophages to release excess amounts of proinflammatory cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor [TNF] and interleukin-1) during overwhelming infection. If delivered early enough, anti-TNF therapy can be effective in animal models of systemic inflammation, but early treatment is difficult to achieve in humans. An alternative therapeutic strategy would be to identify \"late\" macrophage mediators that may be clinically more accessible. We recently discovered that a ubiquitous protein, HMGB1, is released late by activated macrophages and functions as a late mediator of endotoxin lethality. Fetuin (fetus protein in Greek) was first identified by Pederson as a major fetal plasma protein more than 50 years ago and subsequently characterized as a liver-derived negative acute phase protein.",

The serine-threonine kinase Akt plays a central role in survival signaling and translational control, and its activation by growth factors is mediated by phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K).

Animals were intubated, instrumented for vascular access and hemodynamic monitoring, and subjected to global brain ischemia by withdrawal of blood to achieve a mean arterial pressure of 30 to 35 mm Hg. The carotid arteries were occluded with aneurysm clips for 10 minutes. Blood was returned to restore normal mean arterial pressure, and the animals were reperfused for 30 minutes.

The g force experienced on the FieldTurf field at the 30-yard line was 238, whereas on the old AstroTurf field, the same spot produced a g force of 188. Conclusion: The indoor practice field used by a professional football team was changed from AstroTurf with 2.5 cm of padding to FieldTurf in an attempt to improve impact attenuation. Overall, there was no significant difference in impact attenuation; however, there were areas within the field that were significantly compacted, causing some spots on the field to be much harder than the AstroTurf surface, which is presumably caused by the compacting of the shredded rubber on which the field is based.",

For participants who ride a bike, 69.8% indicated that they wear a helmet while riding a bike. However, only 44.2% of scooter riders reported using a helmet while riding their scooter. Parents and children were asked about the existence of a helmet law with a true/false question. Eighty-eight percent of parents correctly answered that this law exists, but only 27.5% reported that their children always wear their gear. Seventy-two percent of the children correctly answered the question, but only 27.5% reported that they always wear their gear. Children were asked to circle the properly fitting helmet (pictures provided by the Consumer Product Safety Commission [CPSC] ). Before viewing the video, 74.0% of children were able to circle the properly fitting helmet. After viewing the video, 100% of children were able to circle the properly fitting helmet. Participants were also asked to identify the recommended safety gear to be worn while riding a scooter. A correct answer required the child to circle all recommended gear (helmet, knee pads, and elbow pads). Before watching the video, 60.0% of participants identified all the recommended gear. After watching the video, this number increased to 82.0% (P=.001). Twenty-one of the fifty participants completed the follow-up questions. Of these, 15 children rode a scooter at the initial survey and at the follow-up. On the initial parent survey, 33.3% of these parents reported that their children always wore their scooter safety gear. This number increased to 86.7% at follow-up.",

Eighty-five percent of the injuries were in children younger than 15 years. The CPSC has established several recommendations for the safe use of scooters (www.cpsc.gov). Scooter use is high within our study population, but helmet use with scooters is lower than that with bikes. The improvement in correct answers to scooter safety questions after the scooter safety video was viewed indicates that the video is effective in improving scooter safety knowledge in the study population. In addition, the results of the follow-up telephone survey suggest that an increase in scooter safety awareness leads to a change in scooter-riding behavior. Limitations to this study include the small sample size. In addition, non-English speaking parents and children were excluded from the study because the video and study forms were not available in other languages. We did not control for ED diagnosis, and patients with injuries may be more receptive to this subject in the ED. We did not compare it with other educational methods on this subject. Our pilot data showed that the scooter safety video is effective in teaching scooter safety.",

Background: Laboratory investigations such as blood tests are routinely performed on emergency department (ED) patients and are, therefore, an essential part of patient care. ED continuous quality improvement processes include evaluation of the accuracy and timeliness of the results of these investigations to ensure that the former is maximized and the latter meets established benchmarks. Although the accuracy of these tests results is primarily affected by laboratory rather than ED processes, the quality of the sample delivered to the laboratory is the initial factor determining the accuracy of the results. Decreased accuracy can result in delays because the tests are repeated and even errors in patient care if undetected. This study was designed to determine the effect, if any, a pneumatic tube delivery system has on the quality and timeliness of laboratory test results for ED patients.",

Because the ultra-early time course of expression proteomics has not been examined in stroke, serial blood sampling beginning as soon as possible after stroke could provide evidence for a chronic versus acute inflammatory state in stroke patients.

The long scale consists of 3 subjective questions asked of the patient (each graded from 0 to 3), as well as 2 objective measurements made by physician observation (each graded from 0 to 4). Total scoring can range from 0 to 17 points. The scale was administered before drug infusion and 1 hour thereafter, and the change in score was calculated. Akathisia diagnosis by the long scale required an elevation change of at least 2 points in the subjective element, combined with an elevation change of at least 1 point in the objective element. When present, akathisia was graded as mild, moderate, or major, according the degree of score change. To simplify the long scale, we reduced the number of subjective questions from 3 to 1. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to determine the ability of a change in the score of each question to distinguish the presence of akathisia from its absence, as diagnosed by the long scale. The short scale also integrated the 2 objective elements into 1 measure: semipurposeful or purposeless restless motor activity of torso, legs, or feet while sitting. The patient's postdrug report of akathisia severity was taken as the overall akathisia grade. We retrospectively applied the short scale to the cohort.

These data may lay the foundation for determining specific guidelines for disposition of this high-risk patient population. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of adults presenting to an urban ED with UAP during 28 consecutive days. Patients underwent scripted interview and focused physical examination at the ED visit. UAP was defined as abdominal pain of at least an hour's duration that was nontraumatic; not previously diagnosed; not primarily in the flank; not associated with pregnancy, vaginal bleeding or discharge, frequency, dysuria or foul-smelling urine; and not associated with upper or lower gastrointestinal tract bleed. Physicians were asked for their clinical impression about whether the patient disposition based solely on history and physical examination should be (1) treat and release; (2) observe positive and negative test results and probably discharge; (3) observe positive and negative test results and probably admit; or (4) admit to hospital. Patients were followed up for up to 3 months to determine the most reasonable final diagnosis. We also tested whether certain combinations of history and physical examination predicted need for diagnosis. Statistics are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).",

Patients were asked whether they had a known family history of any cardiovascular disease, personal history of any cardiovascular disease, hypertension (HTN), diabetes (DM), hypercholesterolemia (C), or hypertriglyceridemia (TG). They were also asked whether they had any CVRF, whether or not it was treated (Tx), and if treated, whether or not CVRF was under control (Ct). Age, sex, smoking habit, and body mass index (<25 normal; 25 to 30 overweight; >30 obesity) were also recorded. Results between sex were compared by using Student's t and \u03c7 2 tests. Conclusion: Even though men have a significantly higher prevalence of previously known cardiovascular disease, smoking habit, hypercholesterolemia, and being overweight compared with women, all patients discharged from the CPU have a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. The percentage of patients treated and treated and controlled is surprisingly low. The question of whether the CPU should also play an educational and preventive role is raised because otherwise young and active people make up this group. Further studies are needed to determine, in a cost-effective fashion, whether an intervention could prevent these patients from having any further cardiovascular events. Background: Patient likelihood of having an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) according to complete evaluation of epidemiologic characteristics, clinical and ECG findings, and laboratory testing has been published elsewhere. However, these rules cannot be applied to identify chest pain patients at risk of having an ACS and waiting to be treated in a busy emergency department or chest pain unit.

There is evidence of increasing adherence with advancing education. Adherence with ACC/AHA recommendations for NSTEMI/UA is poor for all levels of training, including faculty. The lack of adherence is due to underuse of clopidogrel and GP IIb/IIIa. Educational initiatives for residents and faculty will be needed to improve adherence with published guidelines for acute coronary syndrome. Background: Two main aims of chest pain units (CPUs) are accurate evaluation of patients with possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and early treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction. However, less attention is paid to the \"other patients,\" who usually are quickly discharged once ACS is ruled out.

A plasty of the lateral nail fold beyond the angle of the dorsal fold was performed, combined with excision of the granuloma. Finally, a lateral matricectomy was done using a number 15 scalpel blade. We used a braided polyester thread on 17-mm tapered needle to apply simple sutures on the dorsal incision, the lateral nail fold through nail holes, and the tip of the toe approximating the anterior border of the lateral nail fold to the nail bed. At follow-up, we recorded morbidity (pain, scar discomfort, and wound exudates), infection, growth of nail spikes, recurrence, and time to complete recovery (wearing shoes, performing normal activities, work).

Study objectives: We simulate atlanto-occipital (AO) injury that occurred to 3 children involved in a frontal motor vehicle crash by using mathematical dynamic models (MADYMO) computer simulation. Cervical spine injury to young children is fairly uncommon, but when it does occur, the occipital-C2 region is most commonly injured. These injuries are ligamentous or other soft tissue disruptions rather than fractures. These injuries, however, demand prompt diagnosis for optimal treatment. AO injury in children is associated with a disruption of the tectorial membrane and surrounding ligamentous structures. It has been shown that damage to this membrane is related to the classification of an AO injury as stable or unstable. Most AO injuries are fatal injuries, and the medical and automotive communities have attempted to reproduce this type of injury by using anthropomorphic test devices (ATD). The industry has attempted to assess the loading of the child's neck by reproducing the crash environment and evaluating the load characteristics of the neck of an ATD. These simulations are based on AO injuries that have exceeded the injury threshold enough to cause death. Unique to this case is the fact that all 3 children survived and had different degrees of AO injury.",

The model also shows the occupant kinematics of these restrained rear-seated passengers. The degree of injury to the AO area is shown to differ in severity between the 3-and 7-year-old victims clinically and through evaluation of the computed tomographic scan images.",

The current neck injury criteria are based on scaling of adults and the testing of pigs. The federal requirements also address only the situation of airbag deployment on children's neck injuries. We have a case in which the environment can be recreated with tools accepted by the crash injury community that show the neck IARVs to have been exceeded without fatal injury. We believe that, according to the children's injuries to the AO region, we have seen the tolerance limit for an AO injury and the tectorial membrane. There are currently no data for the variation of tectorial membrane failure stress as a function of age for humans. It is rare that children of various ages survive an AO injury and are close enough in age and weight to be modeled by using MADYMO.",

Access to primary care can be difficult for patients with limited resources, restrictive work schedules, or no designated PCP. Identifying and removing some of these barriers may encourage patients to seek appropriate care for nonemergency health issues. a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Secretory diarrheal illnesses are associated with increased production of prostaglandin E and prostaglandin F. Prostaglandins and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) are known to stimulate intestinal secretions. Enteric pathogens are also known to stimulate intestinal secretions via the same mechanism. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen decrease cAMP and prostaglandin production. We therefore hypothesize that the use of ibuprofen in febrile diarrhea should reduce the volume of fluid loss when compared to acetaminophen, which does not reduce the intestinal secretion of either cAMP or prostaglandin.",

Eighteen patients received cervical spine orthosis and neurosurgery follow-up; 1 was admitted to neurosurgery for an MRI finding of disk bulge with spinal cord edema; none received surgery in 24 hours for cervical spine injuries. Of the 18 patients with abnormal MRI results, there were 4 patients with ligamentous injury, 3 with disk and female patients 14%). The negative operative rate for 110 patients evaluated with CECT was 5.5% (male patients 1.5% and female patients 16.6%). Conclusion: Use of CECT improves the accuracy of diagnosis of AAP compared with clinical assessment alone (NOPR 5.5% versus 11%). When male patients were compared with female patients, we found no difference in the NOPR for female patients who underwent CECT compared with female patients who underwent surgery according to clinical evaluation alone (NOPR 14% versus 16.6%). CECT performed on male patients considered to have equivocal examinations by a surgical consultant decreased the NOPR from 10% to 1.5%. Our results support the added value of CECT scanning in male patients with equivocal examinations and do not support the added value of CT scanning in female patients with equivocal examinations. Results: Fifty percent (2,725) of the patients in the registry were diagnosed with DVT as outpatients, including in the ED. Mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 7.4\u00b119.9 days. Recurrent DVT was reported in more than 50% of patients, and a family history of venous thromboembolism was reported in more than two thirds of patients. Ninety-eight percent of patients experienced symptoms before ultrasonographic confirmation. Most commonly reported symptoms included edema (82%), extremity discomfort (70%), erythema (17%), dyspnea (13%), and difficulty in walking (13%). The most frequent comorbidities were family history of venous thromboembolism (69%), hormone replacement therapy (65%), minor trauma (58%), previous DVT (57%), previous pulmonary embolism (56%), and current smoker (55%). Within 30 days before DVT diagnosis, 21% of patients received some prophylaxis and only 9% received treatment. The most common treatment in these patients was \"bridge\" therapy to warfarin by low-molecular-weight heparin (46%) or intravenous unfractionated heparin (39%).",

Patients with examinations considered to be unequivocal routinely undergo appendectomy without diagnostic CT scanning. Patients with suspected AAP were first examined by an emergency physician and subsequently by a surgical consultant. The study identified 449 patients admitted to a surgical service between December 1999 and January 2003 with a final ED diagnosis of suspected AAP. Patients were excluded if the medical records did not include a final diagnosis or surgical pathology report. In cases in which there was a discrepancy between the results of the pathology report and the surgeons' impression of the pathology, the pathology report was used as the final arbiter. The pathologic diagnosis of appendicitis was based on standard published criteria. Outcome measures included CECT sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy in the diagnosis of AAP, as well as the impact on the negative operative rate (NOPR). The finding of surgical disease not specifically caused by appendicitis was not counted as a negative operation. Further subgroup analysis was performed on the male and female patients.",

In 1996, New York enacted a PLS that defined emergency conditions and required that MCO enrollees be notified (1) that emergency services are not subject to previous authorization, (2) that reimbursement for such services is not to be denied on retrospective review, provided that such services were medically necessary to stabilize or treat an emergency condition; and (3) that procedures for obtaining emergency services be described, including a definition of emergency services. Each MCO was also required to provide informational materials to actual and potential enrollees on request. To our knowledge, no studies have assessed MCO compliance with PLS.",

A 2-question satisfaction survey was also given to the health care providers. Questions on the patients' survey were as follows: \"Did the doctor understand your problem?,\" \"Was the interview respectful to you?,\" \"Did you feel that the doctor was genuinely interested in you?,\" and \"Did the doctor understand your problem?\" Questions on the physicians' survey were as follows: \"Do you think that the patient understood you?\" and \"Do you believe that the patient understood you?\" The physician providers were divided into 2 groups: Group I was made up of physician providers who are not native speakers but have achieved a basic medical Spanish-speaking aptitude and have been certified by the institution as competent translators, officially called \"\u00f1\" providers. Group II was made up of the non-Spanish speaking physicians who used an official translator provided by the hospital's professional translation department.

Several local psychiatric hospitals closed during this period, but these closures were believed to be due more to financial reasons than to the malpractice situation. The university hospital did not increase its capacity for these services during this period. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patient visits to emergency departments (EDs) throughout a 1-year period in the greater Indianapolis area by using the Indiana Network for Patient Care. We examined data from 9 hospitals that represented more than 92% of the emergency care delivered in the metropolitan area according to self-reported data. These hospitals represent 5 independent and competing health care systems, which provide the majority of acute medical care in Indianapolis. The Indiana Network for Patient Care uses a \"global patient index\" to match patients across unrelated hospital systems. Data were exported to a Microsoft Access Database (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Structured query language (SQL) queries were performed to determine the annual ED visit census from the selected institutions, the number of unique patients accounting for the total number of visits, and the average number of visits per treating hospital system. Results: The 9 hospitals included in this analysis provided 474,712 episodes of emergency medical care from September 1, 2001, to August 31, 2002. We excluded 3,072 visits (0.6%) without patient identifiers that could not be matched to the global patient index file, leaving 471,640 ED visits by 288,696 patients. On average, each patient had 1.6 (range 1 to 140) ED visits during the study period. Thirty-one percent (89,043) of the patients had more than 1 visit, accounting for 58% (275,059) of the total number of visits. Of patients with more than 1 visit, 25% (22,605) went to more than 1 hospital system and accounted for 33% (91,729) of all repeat visits and 19% (89,611) of the total number of visits. As patients presented to additional hospital systems, the average number of visits per patient increased dramatically. More than half (266,689) of patients remained within a single hospital system, with an average of 1.4 visits per patient, whereas 97 patients visited all 5 hospital systems, with an average of 21.2 visits per patient.",

To assist oral intubation with the fiberscope, either a Williams or Ovassapian airway was inserted into the mouth. The fiberscope and endoscopic sheath were then guided through the vocal cords and into the trachea under direct vision. The wire from a retrograde intubation kit was then inserted anterograde through the working channel of the endoscopic sheath. After removal of the scope and the sheath, the stiffener from a retrograde intubation kit was then placed over the wire, down the mouth, and into the trachea. A standard 7.0-mm internal diameter tracheal tube was subsequently slid down the stiffener, achieving oral tracheal intubation.

Primary reasons for exclusion were care in clinics not in our database, isolated right-sided heart failure, frequent visits with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, end-stage renal disease, and terminal illness other than CHF. Data were collected on CHF severity, number of ED and clinic visits for CHF, comorbidities, admissions per year for decompensated CHF, inpatient days per year for decompensated CHF, and number of chest radiographs per year. Two cohorts were defined according to the number of times the patient visited a primary care clinic during a year. \"ED primary care physician (PCP)\" patient visits declined 25% below the median number of clinic visits per year: 6 times per year for \"severe\" CHF and 8 times per year for \"end stage\" CHF. \"Clinic PCP\" patients visited the clinics more often than these minimum defined frequencies.",

The groups were comparable in the extent of comorbidities. Results are tabulated in the Table. Conclusion: Patients who receive primary care for severe CHF in the ED rather than in the clinics are admitted to the hospital significantly more often than patients who are treated in the clinics, spend significantly more days in the hospital, and have more frequent diagnostic chest radiographs. Efforts to move patients into primary care settings are likely to be cost effective. were 35 (2%) intubations that were ultimately determined to be nontracheal by receiving physicians. Among these, 20 (57%) patients were intubated for trauma indications. Seven (20%) patients were children (<10 years). Fifteen (43%) patients did not have a pulse before intubation attempts. Overall, 21 (60%) had multiple confirmatory techniques used by paramedics. The most commonly documented was \"equal lung sounds\" (91%), followed by \"visualized cords\" (37%). Colorimetric end-tidal CO 2 was used selectively among patients with pulses, 9 (45%) of 20. Seventeen (49%) of the nontracheal intubations were potentially recognizable according to paramedic documentation. Conclusion: An unrecognized, nontracheal intubation is a potentially devastating consequence of failed airway management. We report a small but not inconsequential experience with failed out-of-hospital airway management. In this emergency medical system, more frequent use of multiple confirmatory techniques (including end-tidal CO 2 detection) may help to reduce the incidence of this potentially life-threatening scenario.",

A half-hour lecture describing both techniques was followed by a 1.5-hour procedure laboratory, during which the residents were able to practice these procedures on deer necks obtained from hunting refuse. The traditional cricothyrotomy involved making a vertical skin incision followed by dissection and a horizontal incision in the cricothyroid membrane. This single-incision method involved using a #11 blade scalpel to puncture the cricothyroid membrane after palpation of landmarks and then use the opposite dull end of the scalpel to dilate the incision for subsequent airway placement. After the procedure laboratory, each subject was asked to perform each method of cricothyrotomy on a deer neck.

When the first and second choices were tallied overall, 71% identified geography as the overriding factor that led to applying to a specific program. Three areas tied for the single most influential reason to make an application decision: program Web-site information, other online information, and mentor advice. However, each of these was ranked as the first choice by less than 50% of the survey respondents. The single most important aspect of a program's Web site according to the applicants was ease of navigation (36% of responders), followed by rotation schedule (29%), community information (7%), and a listing of current residents (6%). The applicants were also asked to identify the aspects of a Web site that were very important, moderately important, slightly important, and not important. Ease of navigation was clearly an expectation of the applicants, with 52% saying that the ease of navigation was very important (88% said that it was moderately or very important). A listed rotation schedule was very important to 49% and moderately important to 42%. Other aspects of the Web site that were considered very important or moderately important include a description of didactics (29% and 34%, respectively), a listing of elective opportunities (28% and 55%, respectively), benefit information other than salary (23% and 50%, respectively), emergency medical services opportunities (22% and 43%, respectively) and a listing of current residents (22% and 42%, respectively). Interestingly, the survey participants considered other items less important. A listed salary on the Web site was very important to 17% but unimportant to 10%. Program facility information (eg, the hospital, emergency department) was very important to only 16%, whereas 53% said it was moderately important. Graphics, faculty information (biographies), a listing of faculty and resident's publications, and research opportunities were factors considered less important. The quality of a program's Web site in general was moderately or very important in the application decision of 49% of students, although 13% said that a program's Web site was unimportant. The programs identified as having a best Web site, excluding the programs involved in the survey, were Denver (4%), Ohio State University (3%), Region's Hospital St. Paul, MN (2%), and Kalamazoo-Michigan State University (2%).",

Geography ranks highest overall as the factor that determines where an applicant may choose to interview for an emergency medicine residency program. Online information, including the program Web sites, is a more important resource for guidance of the students than mentor or peer advice. The applicants identified ease of navigation and a rotation schedule as the most important aspects of a program's Web site. Almost all the survey participants used the emergency medicine residency program's Web site in their application process. However, only half the applicants believed that the quality of a program's Web site had a significant impact on their decision to apply to a particular program. An easily navigated, complete Web site may improve the recruitment of candidates to an emergency medicine residency program. 15, 2001, and June 30, 2002 , were examined. The QTc interval was obtained by computer analysis of the ED ECG, and the location of the stroke was categorized by vascular territory on head computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. A prolonged QTc was defined as more than 430 ms for men and more than 450 ms for women. Medical record review was standardized by a priori definition of the variables to be studied on a standardized spreadsheet for data abstraction. All consecutive patients in the mentioned period were captured; there were no missing records. The intervals on the ED ECG were compared with those on the previous (baseline) ECG. Factors that could contribute to QTc prolongation were also collected, including current medications and acute electrolyte abnormalities.",

A single, unmasked reviewer (neuro-otologist) abstracted 5 elements of history recorded about each patient: date or time of first symptoms, quality of dizziness, associated pain, triggers for dizziness, and episode duration.

From these data, it appears that the quality of dizziness is given more diagnostic weight by emergency physicians than other attributes of the patient's medical history, most notably, episode duration. However, insights gained through vestibular research throughout the past 30 years have established that episode duration, triggers, and presence or absence of pain usually provide diagnostic information far more important to triage decisions than symptom quality. In conjunction with our other preliminary studies demonstrating a correlation between physician misperceptions and outdated information in ED texts, we believe our results point toward a system-level flaw in the way we train emergency physicians to diagnose dizzy patients, which could be responsible for a substantial number of misdiagnoses of significant clinical impact.

Conclusion: Our model demonstrates that even small amounts of supplemental oxygen in a hypoventilating patient with normal oxygenation capacity can produce clinically reassuring oxygen saturation levels despite significant hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis. Although maintaining appropriate oxygenation is critical, it is also important to recognize that the patient is at continued risk for significant physiologic changes secondary to hypercapnia if alveolar ventilation is not also restored.

Patients aged at least 18 years and who were triaged to an intermediateacuity section of the ED were included. Study patients were interviewed by using a survey instrument during their ED visit. The primary analysis was descriptive. Univariate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and multivariate logistic regression was used to control for demographic factors and simultaneously assess effects of independent variables. Results: A total of 302 patients were approached; the study set comprised the 268 (88.7%) who had PCPs. Of the 268 patients with PCPs, 128 (48%) called their PCP before coming to the ED. Patients gave several reasons why they did not call their PCP: 81 (58% of 128) thought their condition was too urgent, 17 (12%) stated it did not occur to them, and 10 (7%) failed to call their PCP because they did not think they would be treated soon enough.",

Participant dialogue was split about the ethics of premortem cannulation as defined in uncontrolled DCD donation.

They are at higher risk of percutaneous injury and therefore should adopt universal precautions; shield and sheath devices would also reduce the risk of sharp injury. The HIV PEP is effective if given early, so needlestick injury patients must be assessed urgently, and antiretroviral agents must be given as soon as possible, if indicated. Emergency medicine has had an increasing role in treatment of health care workers' needlestick injuries occurring outside working hours, in out-of-hospital injuries, and in other presentations for HIV PEP. Greater education of emergency staff, other health care workers, and the general public is required for optimal management of needlestick injuries.",

Twelve standardized chicken legs were prepared for foreign body insertion. The skin was removed from each leg, and a small 0.5-cm incision was made at the superior aspect of the leg, allowing for the placement of a 0.25-cm metallic foreign body approximately 1 cm deep into the meat of the chicken. All participants were made aware that a metallic foreign body was present in each chicken leg. The experimental group was asked to remove the foreign body with the aid of a Sonosite 180 Plus bedside ultrasonographic scanner with an L38/10-5 MHz linear transducer, in addition to the tools present in a standard suture set (forceps, scissors, needle driver, sterile towels, and sterile gauze).

More events should be prepared to treat a wide variety of injury and illness. Additional investigations are needed to expand the body of literature and further delineate injury and illness patterns during these events. Results: During the study period, 2,327 search and rescue events were recorded; 50% for traumatic injuries, 24% for medical illness, 15% for missing persons, and 11% for assistance of uninjured or stranded individuals. The average age of a person rescued was 32 years (<1 year to 98 years), with males represented 62%. The average time of a search and rescue event was 5 hours 0 minutes. Fifty percent of the traumatic injuries involved the lower extremity, followed by the head (14%), the chest and abdomen (12%), the upper extremity (10%), and unspecified (14%). Thirty percent of these injuries were fractures. Thirty-one percent of these injuries resulted from a fall. The 2 most common medical reasons necessitating rescue were dehydration (25%) and hypothermia (14%). Sixty-nine percent of deaths were a result of traumatic injury, 22% were a result of drowning, and 11% were a result of cardiac arrest. Further analysis of the data is ongoing.",

During the 10-year period from January 1990 through December 1999, more than 2,000 search and rescue events were recorded. Fifty percent of these events were a result of traumatic injuries, most commonly from falls, and 24% for medical illness, most commonly from dehydration. These results have important implications for those who provide search and rescue services in terms of planning, staffing, and education of personnel. They also identify several common conditions such as dehydration and lower extremity injuries that may be reduced through educational programs directed at park visitors.",

Ownership or access to a bicycle was required. New bicycle helmets and safety material were provided free by the regional county health care agency. Patients in the study were divided into 2 groups: group A were patients who did not already have a helmet, and group B were patients who already owned a helmet. Patients and parents were given a tested bicycle safety questionnaire before an educational intervention consisting of a 15-minute bicycle safety video and the distribution of bicycle safety brochures. Additionally, patients in group A were given a helmet properly fitted by trained study personnel. Followup telephone interviews of patients and parents were conducted at approximately 2 weeks and again at 6 months after the ED visit by using a 35-question tested survey instrument. Parents and patients were interviewed independently. A patient was considered a regular helmet user if he or she met all of the following criteria: parent stated that child always used a helmet, child stated that he or she always used a helmet each time he or she rode a bicycle in the past month, child stated he or she used a helmet the last time of bicycle use, and child stated that he or she planned to use a helmet at next bicycle use.

Development of hospital emergency management policies for NBC events requires a reevaluation of resources, including 1 of the most crucial components, personnel. Employee participation may be affected by conflicts between personal and professional obligations. An assessment of employee attitudes may aid in planning efforts. In addition, providing for the care and security of employees and their families, as well as patients, may increase participation and consequently improve outcomes. The purpose of the study was to determine (1) anticipated availability of emergency department (ED) staff during various disaster scenarios, including NBC events; (2) importance of personnel support factors that may enhance participation during a prolonged disaster; (3) reliance of employee dependents on the medical center for basic needs during extended staff work hours; and (4) willingness of dependents to act as volunteers.",

For a chemical event while at work, 96% of MD/DOs, 57% of RNs, 91% of flight crew, and 56% of other staff stated they would stay. Sixteen percent of respondents were \"unable to answer\" about their ability to stay during an NBC event. Overall, there was a 22% further decrease in staff willing to come in from home for an NBC event. Eighty-five percent of all ED staff indicated they would commit to work in a disaster occurring as a result of multiple trauma or weather. The importance of support factors, listed in descending order of perceived priority, for all employees were security at work, training, shelter for self, medical care, shelter for family, clarification of role, food, scheduled relief, compensation, security at home, stress debriefing, transportation, child care, pet care, home or farm care, and elder care. The relative importance of these factors was only minimally related to the employee position. The most common limitation for employees who stated that they had other obligations that made it impossible for them to work was child care or family commitments. Thirty-four percent of respondents thought that they would rely on the hospital for care of their dependents. For these respondents, care or accommodations for an average of 2.6 dependents per employee would be necessary. The ages of dependents were 6% taken on a new importance and urgency.

Previous studies have observed that there is a subset of asthma patients treated repeatedly in EDs. These patients have poorer outcomes and account for a greater percentage of health care resources. By examining demographic characteristics of repeated versus nonrepeated ED users, we hope to identify factors related to ED recidivism. Methods: This was a case-control, retrospective, medical record review study of 1,272 patients treated for acute asthma in a Level I pediatric ED from January 1999 through April 2002. Eligible patients were those who met the criteria of relapse or recidivism for asthma. Relapse was defined as a return asthma visit to the ED within 20 days of index visit.

Eleven records contained missing biographic data about patient race and were excluded from analysis. Twenty-four records were of patients who were neither identified as AA or HA nor included in the analysis. A total of 334 patients were included in the analysis. The average age for men and women was similar (men 42 years, range 18 to 88 years; women 42 years, range 18 to 82 years); however, compared with the female group, more men were identified as HAs (78% versus 69%) and, also compared with women, fewer men were identified as AAs (22% versus 31%). AA and HA male and female patients had similar precipitants of asthma during the study period. The largest category of precipitating etiology was \"unknown asthma precipitant\" for men and women (29% and 32%, dren in more urban counties; however, this pattern was inconsistent. The adjusted odds of an ED visit for asthma versus all other diagnoses by county of residence was calculated by using multiple logistic regression to control for demographic factors known to affect asthma (age group, race, sex, and payer status), again using Baltimore City as the reference county. Unexpectedly, when adjusted for these factors, ED visits by children living in affluent suburban Howard County had a greater likelihood of being for asthma than ED visits by children from Baltimore City. Conclusion: Asthma remains a critical health problem for many Americans, particularly children. In this study, we try to isolate the influence of county level geographic variability on ED asthma use. From an overall public health perspective, it is clear that Baltimore City (an urban area with high rates of poverty and a predominantly black population) has the highest burden of disease from asthma, as measured by children seeking care in EDs. However, this study illustrates that geographic variability in ED use for asthma is not based solely on an urban environment.

One hundred eight children in traffic accidents of 306 (35.62%) children were children not crossing at pedestrian crossings. Fifty-five (17.97%) children crossed between stopped or parked vehicles. Seventeen (5.56%) children were injured because of not paying attention to traffic lights, 50 (16.34%) children were injured on the pedestrian crossing, 32 (10.46%) children were injured while riding on motorcycles, bicycles, or mopeds, 25 (8.17%) children were injured as passengers, and 18 (5.88%) children were classified as others. Of the children in traffic accidents, 81.37% were pedestrians. Spring and summer are the most common seasons for injury (195 [63.73%] of 306 children in crashes), along with the afternoon hours (noon to 8 PM, 68.89%).

Patients meeting LAPSS criteria were transported to any of 60 hospitals in the greater Los Angeles area. Results: Six hundred forty (80%) of the 800 patients who met LAPSS criteria during the study interval had complete hospital records available for review. Five hundred thirty-eight (84%) patients had an emergency department diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Of these patients, 26 (4.8%) of the final diagnosis stroke patients received t-PA. The mean delay from reported onset of symptoms until accessing 911 was 18 minutes (range 0 to 48 minutes). The mean elapsed time from onset of symptoms to administration of t-PA was 138 minutes (range 0 to 224 minutes). Three patients were administered t-PA outside of the recommended 3-hour interval, 2 of whom died. Two (8%) patients who received t-PA subsequently developed intracranial hemorrhage. One of these patients died and the other was left vegetative. Altogether, 4 (15.4%) t-PA patients died. The mortality for patients who did not receive t-PA was 10.9%. Conclusion: Although a small percentage of patients with acute stroke received t-PA",

The human suffering for victims of traffic-related injuries and their families is incalculable. The costs associated with surgery, prolonged hospitalization, and long-term rehabilitation for such victims, in addition to their lost productivity, represent tens of billions of dollars each year. Traffic injury is still an unsolved problem in Lithuania and other Baltic countries. In Lithuania, approximately 5,000 people die annually due to injuries, including 400 children and adolescents. In traffic accidents, there are approximately 700 deaths annually (22/100,000 population) including 70 adolescents and children. The injury rate in 2001 was 111.0 per 1,000 population; the child injury rate was 109.9 per 1,000 population. Disability; deaths caused by injuries; and social, humanitarian, and economic harm to society show the importance of injury-prevention activities.

For medicolegal concern more than 50 (high concern), we did find a significantly lower clinical suspicion than for low-risk tests for attending physicians (P=.02); for residents, there was a trend towards lower clinical suspicion, but the results were not significant (P=.22). Conclusion: Concern about medical malpractice is often a significant factor in the decision to order diagnostic tests in the ED, and often the perceived medicolegal concern outweighs clinical suspicion. This study found that residents perceive higher levels of medicolegal concern and clinical suspicion in test ordering than attending physicians.

A preintervention survey was distributed to 20 emergency medicine PGY-1 to PGY-3 residents. The survey included questions about the number of examinations performed, confidence in performing examinations, and general knowledge about care of sexual assault victims. First-year residents served as internal controls and did not receive intervention. The secondand third-year resident participants were given a collection of self-study materials consisting of articles and textbook excerpts. These residents also observed and assisted with examinations performed by SANE practitioners. The SANE program cares for an average of 60 sexual assault patients annually. A posttest was then given to the residents to determine whether knowledge and confidence in performing sexual assault examinations had improved. Results: After intervention, 70% of residents had performed at least 1 examination in comparison with 40% before intervention. Sixty percent of residents after intervention answered that they were either somewhat or very confident in performing the examination compared with 40% in the pretest",

ED patients 18 years or older who had 1 or more prespecified diagnostic tests ordered by the treating emergency physician were eligible for inclusion. Diagnostic tests included troponin, chest radiograph, extremity radiograph, head computed tomography (CT), chest CT, abdominal or pelvis CT (ACT), cerebrospinal fluid analysis, abdominal ultrasonographic scan, pelvic ultrasonographic scan, and ventilation/perfusion scan. Surveys were administered to resident and attending physicians in the ED immediately after tests were ordered. The surveys used visual analog scales (VAS) from 0 to 100 to estimate the physicians' clinical suspicion that ordered tests would yield abnormal results and to estimate the influence of medicolegal concern on the decision to order each test. VAS scores were then analyzed by using statistical methods (means, SDs, t tests, and simple linear regression). Results: Two hundred thirty-two patients had a total of 314 tests performed throughout a 6-month period. Residents' perceived medicolegal concern exceeded clinical suspicion in 33.3% of cases, whereas attending physicians' medicolegal concern exceeded clinical suspicion in 15",

Using a logarithmic transformation, t test, and the GLM procedures of SAS software, I assessed the charge differential of the 2 groups, EUS and No EUS. The regression model controlled for ICD-9 codes and Injury Severity Scores.Results: The NTDB contained information on 6,895 patients with ICD-9 codes for blunt abdominal trauma; 150 (1.73%) of these reports contained codes for early ultrasonographic evaluation. There was a significant difference in charges between the EUS group, $29,924.10 (95% confidence interval[CI] $17,894.70 to $41,953.51),  and the No EUS group, $43,127.66 (95% CI $40,172.60 to $46082.72). The significance of the difference was not maintained in the general linear model.Conclusion: Millions of patients are evaluated nationwide each year for blunt abdominal trauma; more than 500,000 patients require operative intervention. Not all patients are stable for transfer to the computed tomography (CT) suite. Using focused abdominal sonography in trauma examinations as the primary screening modality, with complementary use of CT, may be cost-effective. Approximately 1 million patients sustain major torso trauma each year. A conservative extrapolation of mean charges of the 2 groups reflects a potential savings of more than $1 billion per year.168 Ultrasonography Performed by the Emergency Physician inEmergency ParacentesisNazeer S, Dewbre H, Miller AH/University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Parkland Health and Hospital System Emergency Department, Dallas, TX",

Methods: Assault patients were identified from billing records of 6 of 11 city hospitals operated by New York City Health and Hospital Corporation. Pollution data were obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency and weather data from the National Weather Service. Pollutants studied included particles less than 10 parts per million (oxides of nitrogen, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and sulfur dioxide). This is an observational study covering 2,636 days beginning January 1, 1995. Data were analyzed with Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling by using SAS version 9. We did not include in our models complex interaction ral center ED in Orange County. Eligible women were at least 18 years of age and were in an intimate relationship at the time of the survey or during the previous year. Exclusion criteria were altered mental status, acute psychiatric illness, prison residence, severity of illness preventing participation, and inability to obtain consent or administer the survey privately.Results: All surveys were included in statistical analysis. The point prevalence for physical, emotional, and sexual partner violence was 6.8%. The 1-year prevalence was 37.0%. Emotional abuse was reported most often; sexual abuse was reported least. Women with emotional partner violence in the past year were 49.7 times more likely to have current emotional abuse than women without past emotional partner violence (P<.0005). Those with physical partner violence in the past year were 3.8 times more likely to report current physical partner violence (P<.0005). Income correlated inversely with partner violence. We found no correlation between partner violence and race or education.Conclusion: Data for partner violence in Orange County are consistent with data elsewhere. Emergency physicians should be vigilant in screening all women to avoid future abuse and delaying needed services.

A logistic regression model was constructed to assess the characteristics associated with repeated violence.Results: Of 741 patients treated in the ED, 545 patients consented and were enrolled. One hundred ninety-six patients were successfully contacted for followup. The mean age for the uncontacted group was 18.58 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 18.28 to 18.88 years) and for the contacted group was 17.59 years (95% CI 17.06 to 18.02 years). The age difference was significant, with P=.002. There were no significant differences in sex, ethnicity, or type of injury between the contacted group and the uncontacted group. Of the 196 contacted patients, 41 (20.92%; 95% CI 15.11% to 26.73%) reported at least 1 repeated episode of violence. The mean age for the repeat group was 16.83 years (95% CI 15.67 to 17.99 years); 68.29% were male. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or ethnicity between the repeated violence group and the non-repeated violence group.Conclusion: Youths who presented to the ED and had experienced a violent injury were a difficult group to follow up and were at risk for repeated violence. There was no association between repeated violence and demographic characteristics. Further analyses of follow-up systems and risk factors for repeated violence are needed.",
