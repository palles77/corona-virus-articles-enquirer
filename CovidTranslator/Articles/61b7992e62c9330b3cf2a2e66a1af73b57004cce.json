It was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion with human glutathione S-transferase (hGST) and was confirmed by Western blotting analysis. This recombinant N protein (hGST-N) was purified and used to measure the SARS-CoV N-specific antibody in the sera of eight SARS patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Specific antibody response to this purified recombinant N protein was 100% positive in the SARS patients' sera, while none of the control sera from 30 healthy people gave a positive reaction in the same assay. The SARS-CoV N protein was also expressed in Lactococcus lactis in the cytoplasm or secreted into the medium. The N-producing strain MG1363/ pSECN and the purified hGST-N protein were respectively administered to mice, either orally or intranasally. Results indicated that orally delivered MG1363/pSECN induced significant N-specific IgG in the sera. In conclusion, our work provides a novel strategy to produce the SARS-CoV N protein for serodiagnosis and for L. lactis-based mucosal vaccines.",

The N protein is a 422-amino-acid alkaline protein with a short lysine-rich region suggested as the nuclear localization signal. It plays an important role in the process of virus particle assembly by enveloping the entire genomic RNA (Marra et al. 2003) . The SARS-CoV N protein has been suggested as a potent antigen for the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection (Timani et al. 2004) . Moreover, recent evidence indicates that the N protein can induce a T-cell response to SARS-CoV infection (Gao et al. 2003) ; and thus the N protein is also important in the development of an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV infection.",

LABbased vaccines can effectively achieve mucosal and systemic immunization at mucosal sites, which are the entry routes of many pathogens including SARS-CoV and HIV. For instance, Lactococcus lactis has been used as a vaccine delivery system for the HIV Env protein. Oral administration of this recombinant vaccine antigen induces strong HIV-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses which significantly reduce the viral load following challenge with an Env-expressing vaccinia virus (Xin et al. 2003) .",

For the second one, the n gene was amplified with primers P2F/ P2R and cloned into the BamHI/SalI-linearized pGEX4T-1, generating pGEXN (Fig. 1b) . For the third one, the hgst gene was amplified from pET23b::hgst (Xiang et al. 2003) with primers P3F/P3R and digested with NdeI and BamHI. At the same time, the n gene was generated from pGEXN by digestion with BamHI and SalI. These two DNA fragments were cloned into pET23b together at the NdeI and SalI sites, resulting in plasmid pT7hGSTN (Fig. 1c ). All these plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21DE3 for N protein production and/or purification. For expression of the N protein in the cytoplasm of L. lactis or secretion into the culture medium, two expression plasmids were also constructed. For the first one, the n gene was amplified with primers P4F/P4R. After digestion with NcoI and XbaI, it was cloned into pNZ8048 at the same sites, generating pCYTN for nisin-induced production of the N protein (Fig. 1d) .

First, the production of the recombinant SARS-CoV N protein in L. lactis NZ9000/pCYTN was analyzed before and after nisin induction. The protein extracts from cytoplasm and the medium were both subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting assays with the anti-N antibodies prepared above.

Western blotting showed that a prominent band of 46 kDa corresponding to size of the mature N protein was observed in the medium, indicating that the SARS-CoV N protein can be secreted by this recombinant L. lactis strain; and only a few secreted N proteins were degraded (Fig. 4b) .

Although many ELISA diagnostic kits have been invented basing on a viral protein mixture, it does not seem convenient in its preparation, because it requires the cultivation of SARS-CoV. Thus, an alterative simple, sensitive and specific N protein-based ELISA has been investigated in many laboratories (Liu et al. 2004; Timani et al. 2004; Woo et al. 2004 ). All these investigations suggest that the N protein is immunodominant and is a perfect diagnostic antigen. For this purpose, we developed a sim- N-specific antibody levels in groups of mice immunized orally with control strain L. lactis MG1363, purified hGST-N or recombinant strain L. lactis MG1363/pSECN. The sera of the mice in each group were combined and diluted (1:10, 1:100, 1:1000) when subjected to ELISA analysis. The ELISA results were expressed as relative OD 450 values, where the OD 450 of the sera from the naive mice (Naive) in each dilution was assigned the value of 1.0. * Note that oral administration of MG1363/pSECN induced a significant level of N-specific antibody (P<0.02, t-test) ple way to express and purify the SARS-CoV N protein, by fusion with human GST protein. When the purified hGST-N protein was used as a coated antigen in the ELISA assay for serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV infection, it showed a high level of sensitivity (100% positive for the eight tested SARS patients) and specificity (100% negative for the 30 tested healthy people). Also, the ELISA signal was even better than that of the commercial kit (Fig. 3b) . As the hGST-N protein can be purified in a single step and the fused human GST is believed not to generate antibodies in human sera, it thus provides a significant option for use in the serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV N protein is also reported to be important for the enhancement of antibody production and for the generation of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL); and it is suggested that the N protein-induced CTL might play an important role in clearing the infected cells, thereby decreasing the rate of pathogen replication in the mucosal epithelium (Gao et al. 2003; Zhu et al. 2004 ). Since SARS-CoV infection is through the mucosal membrane, oral or intranasal vaccination might improve the protection efficiency. Thus, two strategies for mucosal vaccination of the N protein have been investigated in our work. One is using the purified hGST-N as the vaccine antigen and the other is using N-expression L. lactis as a live vaccine. For the first one, since hGST is safe for human beings, hGST-N should be acceptable for human vaccination. However, the efficient dosage of hGST-N and the means of administration remain to be investigated. For the second one, since L. lactis is a food-grade LAB and is also acid-and bileresistant, it might be a good choice as a vehicle for N protein oral vaccination. It was revealed that oral administration of recombinant L. lactis MG1363/pSECN induces significant N-specific antibodies (Fig. 5 ) and is much more efficient than the oral or intranasal administration of the purified hGST-N, implying that L. lactis is a suitable vehicle for the delivery of N protein to intestinal mucosal sites. Thus, expression of SARS-Cov antigens in L. lactis might provide a novel vaccine. Of course, the immunogenicity of the MG1363/pSECN vaccine is still low. Its CTL response and protective function, including its use as an adjuvant antigen of the SARS-Cov S protein-based mucosal vaccines, remain to be investigated.",

We also constructed a few recombinant L. lactis that expressed the N protein. Oral administration of N-producing L. lactis MG1363 induced N-specific antibodies in mouse sera. These results provide a novel strategy and crucial information for producing the SARS-CoV N protein as a diagnostic antigen and as a mucosal vaccine.",
