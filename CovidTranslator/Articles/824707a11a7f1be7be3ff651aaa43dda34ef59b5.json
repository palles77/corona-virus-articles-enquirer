            "text": "The subgenomic mRNA transcription and genomic replication of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are directed by the viral replicase. The replicase is expressed in the form of two polyproteins and is subsequently processed into smaller nonstructural proteins (nsps). nsp9, containing the viral replicase, has characteristic sequence motifs conserved among the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) of positive-strand (PS) RNA viruses. To test whether the conserved SDD motif can tolerate other conserved motifs of RNA viruses and the influence of every residue on RdRp catalytic activity, many amino acids substitutions were introduced into it. Only one nsp9 substitution, of serine by glycine (S3050G), could rescue mutant viruses. The rescued virus was genetically stable. Alteration of either aspartate residue was not tolerated, destroyed the polymerase activity, and abolished virus transcription, but did not eliminate virus replication. We also found that the SDD motif was essentially invariant for the signature sequence of PRRSV RdRp. It could not accommodate other conserved motifs found in other RNA viral polymerases, except the GDD motif, which is conserved in all the other PS RNA viruses. These findings indicated that nidoviruses are evolutionarily related to other PS RNA viruses. Our studies support the idea that the two aspartate residues of the SDD motif are critical and essential for PRRSV transcription and represent a sequence variant of the GDD motif in PS RNA viruses.",

            "text": "RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) function as the catalytic subunit of the viral replicase. RdRps are required for the replication and transcription of all positive-strand (PS) RNA viruses, in concert with host proteins and, sometimes, other viral proteins [1, 2] . The RdRp domain is essential for RNA replication [3, 4] . Several conserved sequence motifs have been identified in the putative RdRps of several animal and plant PS RNA viruses [5] . Currently, eight conserved motifs are known to be present in all classes of polymerases, and four of them reside in the catalytic portion of the \"palm\" domain [1, 2, 6] . The most conserved palm domain contains the four amino acid sequence motifs found in all classes of polymerases, named A, B, C, and D [7] , plus a fifth motif E, unique to RdRps and reverse transcriptases [1] . This structural conservation implies that palm domains of all RdRps may have evolved from a common, ancient ancestor. Motif C forms a \"\uf062-strand, turn, \uf062-strand\" structure that contains the highly conserved Gly-Asp-Asp (GDD) motif, with the aspartic acid residues exposed in the loop region found in RdRps, an RdRp hallmark [5, [8] [9] [10] . This structure is very similar in all classes of polymerases, and positions the two DD residues close to the conserved D of motif A [1] . The two aspartic acids have been postulated to be involved in the catalytic activity and metal ion coordination of the enzyme [7, [10] [11] [12] . The RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) of all positive stranded RNA viruses and double stranded RNA viruses, such as reoviruses, contain a GDD motif, a highly conserved sequence located at the active site. However, with one exception, the RdRps of nidoviruses have a replacement of the Gly residue by a Ser residue preceding the two key catalytic Asp residues in the GDD motif [4] . Thus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has an SDD signature instead of the canonical GDD in the RdRp (nsp9) [13] [14] [15] (Figure 1 , Table 1 ). The role of the serine residue in the RdRps of nidovirus has not been studied; however, the corresponding glycine residue is essential for poliovirus RdRp and for other RdRps carrying a GDD signature [15, 16] . It is said that the phylogeny of RdRps mainly parallels the taxonomy of RNA viruses. The other RNA viruses also have a particular conserved motif in the place of the GDD motif, such as the GDN motif of nonsegment-negative stranded RNA viruses [16, 17] , the SDD motif of segment-negative stranded RNA viruses [16, 18, 19] , and the MDD motif of retroviruses [18] ( Table 1 ). The universal occurrence and exceptional conservation of RdRps has led to RdRps, along with a few other replicative proteins, being used for the identification and classification of RNA viruses. What then, is the phylogenetic relationship of these different motifs among RNA viruses? Based on the present studies of the GDD motif, the requirement for the glycine residue of the GDD motif is somewhat flexible for in vitro RNA synthesis [2] . Studies on polioviruses, HCV [1] , RHDV, tombusviruses [20] , rubella viruses (RV) [1] , CSFV [21] , and caliciviruses [22] showed that the first aspartate of the GDD motif appears to be a strict requirement, as any changes to this position are not tolerated for in vivo viral replication and/or in vitro RNA synthesis. Studies of the second aspartate of the GDD motif showed it was not absolutely conserved in all classes of polymerases, suggesting some flexibility at this position. However, mutational analysis indicates a relatively strict requirement for an aspartate at this position in the RdRps of calicivirus [22] and encephalomyocarditis virus [1] . Overall, single or multiple substitutions of the equivalent residues in viral RdRps were shown to change or even abolish polymer-ase activity, depending on the assay conditions used [23] .",

Although many studies suggest nsp9 is the RdRp of PRRSV [25, 26] , there is no experimental evidence to demonstrate its catalytic activity. A core palm structure containing the four motifs (A-D) found in all classes of polymerases [1] is present in the C-terminal region of nsp9; therefore, it is possible to identify RdRp catalytic activity by testing whether the conserved SDD motif (at residues 3050 to 3052 of nsp9) itself is essential for virus replication (Figure 1) . This work provides an opportunity to better understand the biology of PRRSV, as well as to identify antiviral targets for the prevention of PRRSV. Cells transfected with an SGA mutant of EAV did not show detectable RNA replication or subgenomic mRNA transcription [3, 27] . Moreover, previous studies have focused on the structure-function analysis of the GDD motif and mainly depended on in vitro biochemical experiments. However, characterization of the SDD sequence motif of PRRSV has not yet been reported. Given the heterogeneity observed with regard to the GDD motif in RNA polymerases of PS RNA viruses, we wanted to ascertain whether flexibility exists with respect to amino acid substitutions at this site of the PRRSV RNA polymerase and the influences of amino acid change on virus replication and transcription. We utilized site-directed mutagenesis to construct several different combinations of mutations in the SDD motif in an infectious clone of PRRSV, and investigated the functional role of the motif.",

In the infected cell, the genomic negative strands of arteriviruses, like those of coronaviruses, are present in double-stranded replicative intermediates (RIs). To detect the influences of replicase mutants on replication, we used a more sensitive RT-PCR approach to analyze the presence of negative strands in cells transfected with the above mutants. As outlined in Figure 2 , specificity for the antigenomic template was achieved by using primer pair SF12 and SR683. For the detection of genomic negative strands, primer SR683 matches sequences within the ORF1a region and SF12 matches the leader region within the 5\u2032UTR. BHK-21 cells were transfected with the above described mutant clones and pAS7. In the latter clone, the predicted nsp9 RNA polymerase domain was removed, a deletion which has been shown to render PRRSV replication incompetent. We used this mutant clone as a negative control for replication detection. RNA was isolated 24 h after transfection and analyzed for the presence of genomic negative strands (Figure 2) . The RT-PCR results for pAS7 were negative, confirming the specificity of our RT-PCR approach. In the cases of pMDD, pSAD, pSED, pSND, pSDA, pSDE, pSDN, pSGD, pGDN, pSGA, pGDD, and pAPRRS, the replicase mutants produced detectable amounts of genomic negative strands (Figure 2 ).

To investigate the influence of the S3050G mutation of RdRp on the vGDD genome, MARC-145 cells were infected with vAPRRS or vGDD. P0 viral supernatants were serially passaged through plaque purification five times, named P1-P5, and stored for further experiments. RNA was isolated from P1 to P5 virus particles and used for cDNA synthesis and subsequent PCR amplification (Table 3 , Figure 5A ). The sequence covering the regions of the vGDD genome was determined in at least three isolated cDNA clones. In all three sequenced cDNA clones, the original substitution had not reverted; however, two synonymous mutations, i.e., C3960U and U5277C had occurred ( Figure 5C ).

            "text": "In this study, we analyzed some of the properties of the PRRSV RdRp by site-directed mutagenesis of the SDD motif, which is associated with the polymerase activity and is particular to nidoviruses. We took two approaches for systematic mutational analysis of the SDD motif: (i) We introduced either conserved or non-conserved amino acid changes in the SDD motif; and (ii) we introduced mutations that resembled the conserved sequence of other viral RdRps (Table 1) . Based on the sequence alignment, SDD motif was predicted to be a variant of the GDD motif of positive-strand RNA viruses. Our observation that the RdRp of PRRSV is active in replication and transcription when the SDD motif is mutated to GDD suggests that, conversely, the polymerase of other positive-strand RNA viruses might function with an SDD motif. It is reported that the requirement for a glycine residue in GDD motif is strict in the positive-strand RNA viruses [1] . Mutational analysis of the GDD motif of RdRp of RV [2] and TBSV confirmed this view, indeed the mutant ADD was found to revert back [20] . However, our results showed that the mutant amino acid residue S3050G of vGDD did not revert back and was stable until P5. The serine residue of the SDD motif could be substituted by glycine residue. This was the first demonstra-tion of flexibility of the serine residue of SDD motif in PRRSV. In terms of genetic stability, the mutant vGDD could be used as a candidate for genetic marker vaccines. However, it is not obvious why nidoviruses have evolved an SDD sequence in place of the GDD motif. From the multi-step virus growth curve, although vGDD maintained a growth pattern similar to that of vAPRRS, the peak titers of vGDD were lower than those of vAPRRS ( Figure 4) . In terms of how the mutant GDD motif of RdRp affected the replication and transcription of PRRSV, it produced less mRNA7s than vAPRRS, despite producing more sg mRNA7.2 than vAPRRS ( Figure 2) . These results were confirmed in three independent experiments. It has been reported that there is a quantitative balance among sg mRNAs species [30] ; thus, we proposed that a quantitative balance between sg mRNA7.1 and sg mRNA7.2 exists, which was confirmed by our lab (data not shown). RdRp interacts with the promoters of every sg mRNA to produce the sg mRNAs, and a change in the active site of RdRp may influence this interaction, disturbing the quantitative balance between sg mRNA7.1 and sg mRNA7.2.",

In motif C, the sequence GDD is conserved among polymerases of positive-strand RNA viruses, MDD belongs to retroviruses, GDN and SDD are conserved signature motifs of nonsegmented-negative stranded and segmented-negative stranded RNA viruses, respectively [8] , whereas SDD is conserved in nidoviruses. High-resolution structures of RdRps of positive-and double-strand RNA viruses revealed clear similarities, despite sharing little sequence identity, suggesting an evolutionary link between the RdRps of these RNA viruses [15, 20, 31] . To investigate the role of the conserved C motif in the evolutionary process of the polymerase, we mutated amino acid residues of SDD to those conserved amino acids described above. When SDD was mutated to MDD or GDN, RdRp lost transcriptional activity. From the aspect of evolutionary relationship, nidoviruses, which are also positive single-stranded RNA viruses, are closely related to the positive stranded RNA viruses, but are further from the nonsegmented-negative stranded RNA viruses and retroviruses. However, it is unclear why segmented-negative stranded RNA viruses also have an SDD motif, but abrogated polymerase activity when was mutated to GDD [16, 18] .",

To investigate the effect of different charge and polarity of amino acids substituted in the SDD motif on the activity of RdRp, we introduced various amino acid substitutions (Table 1) . First, the aspartate residue was substituted by the simplest amino acid, i.e., alanine, which has no polarity; however, it was lethal to RdRp. Methionine also has no polarity, but mutant pMDD did not produce virus either. The serine residue has no charge; therefore, we substituted the serine residue with glycine residue, which also has no charge. Perhaps the substitution of Ser by Gly produced a functional mutant because of the less polar no charge similarities between Ser and Gly. Aspartate is negatively charged; therefore, we substituted the aspartate residues with glutamate residues, which are also negative charge. However, neither mutant D3051E nor D3052E produced virus, which was similar to a previous study [1] . Replacement of the aspartate residues with uncharged asparagines residues (D3051N or D3052N) also did not produce virus. It can be concluded that the strict requirement of DD residues meant that no substitutions could be tolerated, probably because the DD residues are required for metal ion binding [9, 33] .",

The results demonstrated that mutation of the SDD motif did not completely abolish the function of RdRp, which was different from the results of EAV [3] and other viruses [1, 19, [32] [33] [34] [35] . This could be because the primary function of replication is not determined by the SDD motif in PRRSV, and the SDD motif is specifically involved in transcription. In fact, viral RdRps function with other factors, such as viral and host factors, in natural infection, in which RdRps combine to differentiate genomic RNA replication from sg mRNA transcription. For positive stranded RNA viruses, replication occurs in membrane-bound, multiprotein complexes termed the replication/transcription complex (RTC). However, the domains of RdRp that interact with the other factors, and the process of transcription and replication in the RTC are still unknown. The fact that conservation of the SDD motif is not required for the replication of RdRp in PRRSV, suggested that transcription and replication of PRRSV are two independent processes and may be uncoupled. It is reported that nsp1 of EAV is essential for sg mRNAs production and is dispensable for genome replication [30] . In the synthesis of sg mRNAs, nsp1 combines with the viral RdRp complex to engage in transcription; however, the mechanism is still unknown, and we speculated that the SDD motif of RdRp could interact with nsp1 in this process.",
