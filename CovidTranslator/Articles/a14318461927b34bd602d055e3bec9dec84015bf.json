Although it has since disappeared, its threat to human health remains. Therefore, studies on the prevention and treatment of SARS are important for dealing with epidemics of this and other infectious diseases. The most promising newly developed technology for intervention in SARS may be RNA interference, an endogenous cellular process for the inhibition of gene expression mediated by sequence-specific double-stranded RNAs. Numerous studies have reported the therapeutic potential of RNA interference for the treatment of various human diseases ranging from cancers to infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis. To date, most studies on inhibition of SARS-CoV replication using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been conducted in cell lines in vitro. One study using siRNAs to inhibit SARS-CoV infection in Rhesus macaques demonstrated that siRNAs were effective both prophylactically and therapeutically with no adverse effects in the animals. Challenges remaining for the application of siRNA in vivo for SARS prevention and treatment include the specificity of the siRNAs and the efficiency of delivery. However, with improvements in siRNA design and delivery methods, RNA interference has the potential to become another major weapon for combating dangerous infections due to viruses such as SARS-CoV.",

Recently, numerous papers have reported siRNA RNA interference is an endogenous cellular process for the technology as a potent tool to knock-down gene expression or its inhibition of gene expression mediated by sequence-specific therapeutic potential for treatment of various human diseases double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). This phenomenon was first ranging from cancers [18] to infectious diseases (e.g. HIV, hepatiobserved in petunia flowers, and later reported in Caenorhabditis tis). [14] In this review, we focus on the application of siRNA elegans. [12] These dsRNAs, 21-23 bp in length, are produced by technology to SARS. Readers are also referred to another recent cleavage of a long RNA duplex by Dicer, a ribonuclease III-type review on this subject. [19] enzyme.

The initial report came from two groups using the chemithe application of siRNAs to down-regulation of gene expression cal synthesis strategy. [20, 21] The first group showed that two of six becomes a reality are: (i) generation of effective dsRNAs; and (ii) chemically synthesized siRNAs, based on the SARS-CoV genome delivery of the dsRNAs into targeted cells or organs. To address sequence, resulted in the inhibition of viral cytopathic effect (CPE) the first issue, researchers have established two strategies. The in Vero-E6 cells infected with strain Y3-SARS-CoV.

[15] In this method, two sory evaluation of the CPE of the transfected cells provided single-stranded, complementary, short RNA oligonucleotides are evidence that siRNA might be effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV synthesized. These two short oligonucleotides are then annealed replication. The second group demonstrated that three of six into a dsRNA in a test tube.

Challenges to In Vivo Application of siRNA siRNA duplexes were maintained in the cells. Clearly, this is an area where additional work is needed.
