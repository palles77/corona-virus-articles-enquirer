The computing distances among their S gene sequences resulted in the grouping of these coronaviruses into four clusters, one of them exclusively formed by the Purdue viruses. Three new potential sequence motifs with homology to the \u03b1-subunit of the polymerase-associated nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of rinderpest virus, the Bowman-Birk type of proteinase inhibitors, and the metallothionein superfamily of cysteine rich chelating proteins have been identified. Comparison of the TGEV polymerase sequence with that of other RNA viruses revealed high sequence homology with the A-E domains of the palm subdomain of nucleic acid polymerases.",

Coronaviruses have transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) that include a highly conserved core sequence (CS, previously named intergenic sequence [IS]) 5 -CUAAAC-3 , or a related sequence, depending on the coronavirus, at sites immediately upstream of most of the genes. Since genes often overlap in the Nidovirales, the acronym IS does not seem appropriate in these cases and the acronym CS could reflect the nature of the highly conserved sequence contained within the TRS. These sequences represent signals for the transcription of subgenomic mRNAs [34, 52] . Both genome-size and subgenomic negative-strand RNAs, which correspond in number of species and size to those of the virus-specific mRNAs have been detected [54, 55] . The two models compatible with most of the experimental data are leader-primed transcription [34] and discontinuous transcription during negative-strand RNA synthesis [53] . Recently, strong experimental evidence supporting the discontinuous transcription during negative-strand RNA synthesis has been reported [3, 62] . Also the leader-primed transcription has received additional support [41] .",

It was obtained by passing the first TGEV field isolate 11 times in swine intestine; this virus was kindly provided as a 20% suspension of small intestine cells by Dr. M. Pensaert (Gent, Belgium) [23, 38] . From the uncloned virus passaged once in ST cells (PUR46-SW11-ST1), the PUR46-SW11-ST2-C8 (abbreviated PUR46-C8) and PUR46-SW11-ST2-C11 (abbreviated PUR46-C11) clones were plaque-purified [51] . The PUR46-SW11-ST115 was obtained from the PUR46-SW11 by 115 passages in ST cells and was distributed by L. Saif (Ohio State University) to other laboratories, leading to strains PUR46-MAD [31, 50] and PUR46-PAR [13, 46] . The PUR46-MAD strain was derived from the PUR46-SW11-ST115 strain by five cloning steps in ST cells. The selected clone was named PUR46-MAD in reference to the name of the strain (first three letters), year of isolation (two digits) and the specific clone (last three letters). We have used a similar nomenclature to name other strains derived in different laboratories. The Purdue virus strain NEB72 [50] , was renamed PTV (Purdue-type virus) because of its sequence similarity with the PUR46 strain [2] . The PTV clone was probably derived by the passage of a Purdue strain of TGEV in gnotobiotic pigs by the pulmonary route followed by passage in gnotobiotic pig lung cell cultures, and in diploid swine testicular cells with exposure to an acidic (pH 3) environment and incubation with trypsin (M. Welter, Dallas Center, IA).",

The sequence differences among these viruses are shown ( Fig. 1 ) in relation to the sequence of the PUR46-MAD, the prototype strain of our laboratory. The Purdue virus cluster includes two clones that were isolated from the original in vivo virus stock (virulent PUR46-C11 and attenuated PUR46-C8), clone PUR46-MAD (passaged 120 times in ST cells) with reduced replication in the enteric tract and partially attenuated, and clone PTV that does not replicate within the gut of conventional piglets and is fully attenuated (Table 1) . The link between these cluster members is their passage history [51] or their sequence identity within the 3 -end 8,214 nt ( Fig. 1 ). PTV only has 5 nt changes within the 3 -end 8.2 kb in comparison to the PUR46-MAD clone ( Fig. 1 ). This accumulation of nucleotide substitutions represents 0.57 nt changes per one thousand nucleotides, much lower than the 2.5 per one thousand nucleotides accumulated between the PUR-C8 and PUR-C11 clones. The 3 -end of the PUR46-MAD genome has complete sequence identity with clone C8. Comparison of the 3 -end 8.2 kb sequences of clones PUR46-C11 and PUR46-C8 revealed 22 nt differences, 14 of them in the S gene (Fig. 1) . Three of these nucleotide substitutions were in non-coding regions, one downstream the S gene stop codon (nt S-4370) and upstream the 3a gene, and two on the 3b gene (nts 3b-332 and 3b-432). The other nucleotide substitutions were scattered through the other 3 -end genes. In addition, there was a 6 nt deletion in the PUR46-C8 clone. This deletion has been considered a trade mark of all TGEV Purdue strains since it is present in all Purdue isolates sequenced except the parental PUR46-C11 clone [10, 11, 46, 47, 50, 67] .",

            "text": "In addition, there is another 5 -CUAAAC-3 sequence 120 nt after the first initiation codon of the S gene. In principle, this CS could be responsible for the synthesis of a mRNA that has not been detected, although its size similarity with that of the S gene could have prevented its identification (S. Alonso, I. Sola, and L. Enjuanes, unpublished data). Transcription in coronavirus requires the discontinuous synthesis of the mRNAs in order to link the leader to the coding sequences of each mRNA. This process requires a complementarity between the sequences downstream of the 3 -end of the leader and the sequences flanking the complement of the CS (cCS) in the negative strand [34, 52, 62] . The extent of this complementarity could regulate transcription and was calculated for the TGEV PUR46-MAD strain using two procedures: by computing the complementary nucleotides in an uninterrupted segment of sequence around the CS, or by calculating the total number of complementary nucleotides for a sequence segment including the 6 nt of the CS and 12 nt flanking both the 5 -and the 3 -ends of the CS (30 nt total) (Fig. 3B) . The amount of each mRNA produced after infection with the PUR46-MAD strain, as determined by Northern blot analysis with a probe specific for the 3 -end of the genome (results not shown) was not related to the extent of the potential basepairing (Fig. 3B) . The largest mRNA is the genomic RNA that also serves as the mRNA for ORF 1a and 1b. The remainder are subgenomic mRNAs designated mRNA 2-7 (with the exception of the mRNA 3-1 corresponding to ORF 3b), in the order of decreasing size, encoding ORFs 2 (S), 3a, 3b, 4 (E), 5 (M), 6 (N), and 7 (Table 3 ).",

Poly(A) tails of larger length (100-130 nt) have also been detected in coronaviruses [28, 33, 70] .

A comparison of the S gene sequences among eleven TGEV isolates (Fig. 2) showed that clone PUR46-C11 had the lowest computing distance (0.35) with clone PUR46-C8, while the computing distances with other TGEVs such as the MIL65 strain and with the PRCoVs were higher than 2.0 and 3.0, respectively.

This sequence identity may indicate that the selected virus has a highly favored sequence to grow in ST cells.

In addition, although the mRNAs closer to the 3 -end of the genome are in general more abundant, the relative amount of each mRNA did not precisely correlate with the proximity of each mRNA leader to the 3end of the virus genome, in contrast to what has been described in other positive-strand RNA viruses [20, 61] and also in the negative-strand ones [25, 29, 64] . These results suggest that, in addition to basepairing between the 3 -end of the leader and the TRS complementary sequences [cTRSs], transcription in coronaviruses may be controlled by other viral and cellular factors, including TRS primary and secondary structure. In fact, it has been suggested that the discontinuous transcription that takes place during mRNA synthesis, is probably mediated through the interaction of proteins with both the 3 -end of the leader and with the cTRS, and then, by the binding between these proteins [34, 62] . This protein-RNA interaction most likely requires the recognition of a RNA-TRS primary and secondary structure larger than the CS.",

But, in contrast to these viruses, coronaviruses have the SDD motif instead of the more common GDD one [24, 43, 57] . The high conservation among the Groups 1, 2, and 3 coronavirus polymerase domains in relation to other positive strand RNA viruses, and the conservation of additional replicase domains, for example, the carboxyterminal ORF 1b domain for which no homologue can be found in the other viral replicases, clearly indicates that the Nidovirales replicases are more related to each other than to any other group of positive-stranded RNA viruses [17] . The longer linker (44 aa) identified between the polymerase palm subdomain motifs B and C will also support the grouping of coronavirus polymerases as a subset within the positive-stranded RNA viruses. Motif B of the coronavirus polymerase sequence is also more closely related to the poliovirus polymerase than to the homologous domain of the other viruses analyzed.",

We think that the sequence identities observed are possibly significant because of the number of conserved residues and, at least in the cases of the BBIP and metallothioneins, due to the highly conserved cysteine residues, generally relevant to protein structure and function. Nevertheless, the limited sequence homology observed does not imply that these domains will provide the virus with the corresponding activities. The role of these domains in TGEV replication is being investigated.",
