            "text": "Major progress in Dengue virus (DENV) biology has resulted from the use of infectious clones obtained through reverse genetics. The construction of these clones is commonly based on high-or low-copy number plasmids, yeast artificial chromosomes, yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors, and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). Prokaryotic promoters have consistently been used for the transcription of these clones. The goal of this study was to develop a novel DENV infectious clone in a BAC under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter and to generate a virus with the fusion envelope-green fluorescent protein in an attempt to track virus infection. The transfection of Vero cells with a plasmid encoding the DENV infectious clone facilitated the recovery of infectious particles that increased in titer after serial passages in C6/36 cells. The plaque size and syncytia phenotypes of the recombinant virus were similar to those of the parental virus. Despite the observation of autonomous replication and the detection of low levels of viral genome after two passages, the insertion of green fluorescent protein and Renilla luciferase reporter genes negatively impacted virus rescue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using a DENV infectious clone under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter to facilitate the recovery of recombinant viruses without the need for in vitro transcription. This novel molecular clone will be useful for establishing the molecular basis of replication, assembly, and pathogenesis, evaluating potential antiviral drugs, and the development of vaccine candidates for attenuated recombinant viruses.",

Disease manifestations cover a wide spectrum ranging from dengue with or without warning signs to severe dengue, in which plasma leakage, hemorrhage and organ impairment can lead to death (TDR/WHO, 2009 ). The disease is caused by one of four Dengue virus (DENV) serotypes (DENV-1 to -4), which are enveloped, single-stranded and positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the Flavivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family (Lindenbach et al., 2007) . These viruses possess a short genome of approximately 10.7 kb with a type 1 cap structure (m 7 GpppAmpN 2 ) at the 5 end, two highly structured untranslated regions (UTRs) at the 5 and 3 ends, a long open reading frame (ORF) encoding a single viral polyprotein and lacking a polyadenylate tail at the 3 end. After proteolytic processing, three structural and seven non-structural proteins are generated from the viral polyprotein (Bartenschlager and Miller, 2008) .",

This technology has also been important in identifying and evaluating adaptive mutations and virulence determinants, due to the possibility of generating mutations in specific viral genes or RNA elements, whose effect on viral RNA replication and pathogenesis can be assessed in vitro and in vivo, respectively (Clyde et al., 2008; Filomatori et al., 2011; Friebe and Harris, 2010; Grant et al., 2011; Iglesias et al., 2011; Lodeiro et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2008) . Infectious clones and derived replicons lacking structural components necessary for virus assembly and propagation have also shown potential for the development and characterization of live-attenuated viruses as vaccine candidates (Huang et al., 2003; Kelly et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2007) , genetic vaccines (Pang et al., 2001a) and high-throughput platforms for screening of chemical antiviral compounds (Chao et al., 2012; Hsu et al., 2012; Qing et al., 2010; Zou et al., 2011) and siRNAs (Ng et al., 2007) . In addition, infectious clones with reporter genes fused to some of the structural proteins become a powerful tool in cell biology of viral infection for subcellular localization of viral proteins and for tracking the viral particles during the entry, maturation and exit steps of the vital cycle (Brandenburg and Zhuang, 2007) .",

            "text": "Common strategies for the construction of infectious cDNAs from DENV genomes through reverse genetics have been based on standard high-copy and low-copy number plasmids (Gualano et al., 1998; Kinney et al., 1997; Lai et al., 1991; Sriburi et al., 2001) . However, the high instability of the full-length clones leading to rearrangements and unsuccessful clone rescue has been a common problem when using some of these backbones (Suzuki et al., 2007) . To overcome this problem, yeast artificial chromosomes and yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors have been successfully used with higher stability (Kelly et al., 2010 (Kelly et al., , 2011 Polo et al., 1997; Pu et al., 2011; Puri et al., 2000) . More recently, DENV-1 and -2 infectious cDNAs have been cloned into bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) (de Borba et al., 2012; Pierro et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2007) , a system facilitating the stable cloning of inserts up to 300 kb, as there are typically only one or two copies of the BAC per cell (Kim et al., 1996; Shizuya et al., 1992) . However, these DENV infectious clones have been constructed under the control of the prokaryotic T7 promoter, requiring in vitro transcription (Run-off) and subsequent transfection of the synthesized RNAs. One decade ago, the first stable cloning of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) under the transcriptional control of the eukaryotic cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter was demonstrated (Almazan et al., 2000) . TGEV, as a member of the coronavirus genus, has one of the largest RNA genomes of approximately 30 kb in length, thus demonstrating the functional stable cloning of that genome into infectious cDNAs (Lai, 2000) and the opportunity for DNA-launched transcription from an eukaryotic promoter, avoiding expensive in vitro transcription and the subsequent manipulation of transcribed RNAs for transfection.",

African Green Monkey kidney (Vero) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC number: CCL-81) and maintained as low passage cultures (up to passage 10) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Gibco BRL, Carlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with 2-10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin and incubated at 37 \u2022 C, 5% CO 2 atmosphere and 95% relative humidity. C6/36 cells, derived from whole larvae of Aedes albopictus (ATCC number: CRL-1660), were cultured in Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Gibco BRL, Carlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with 2-10% FBS and 20 mg/mL tryptose phosphate broth and incubated at 28 \u2022 C, 5% CO 2 atmosphere and 95% relative humidity.

The supernatants were collected at 96 h postinfection (hpi), cleared from cell debris through low-speed centrifugation, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C. For virus titration using a plaque assay, Vero cells were infected with serially diluted virus supernatants, incubated at 37 \u2022 C with an overlay containing carboxymethylcellulose, fixed with paraformaldehyde and stained with Crystal Violet at 9 days post-infection (dpi), as previously described (Martinez-Gutierrez et al., 2011) . Because of the small plaque size phenotype of the parental DENV-2 NGC M2 strain and the derived infectious clone, the plaques were counted and captured using an inverted light microscope with minimal magnification (4\u00d7 objective). The ImagePro Plus 3.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Springs, MD, USA) was used to delimitate the plaques, and their diameters were estimated by ruling the images with a scale obtained from the microscope configuration.",

The first step was the selection of naturally occurring unique recognition sites in the DENV genome spaced at approximately 3 to 4 kb. The selected Sph I (at position 1385), Nsi I (at position 4701) and Pml I (at position 8834) restriction sites were absent in pBeloBAC11. The second and third steps were the generation (PCR 1, 2, 5, and 6, overlapping PCR 1 and 2) and cloning of the fusion fragments (Cloning 1 and 2). The fusion of the CMV promoter sequence to the DENV 5 UTR and the partial structural region (nt 1 to 1384) was performed through overlapping PCR containing both fragments in equimolecular quantities (up to 100 ng of the larger PCR product) and forward (CMV5) and reverse (DEN2L3) primers of the first and second fragment to be fused, respectively. Thermal conditions included an optimal annealing temperature for the overlapping region, and initial amplification (1 to 10 cycles) in the absence of primers to allow the annealing and extension of the single-stranded templates.

The last part of the non-structural region and the 3 UTR (nt 8835 to 10723) fused to HDV-RZ and BGH termination and polyadenylation signals to stabilize the mRNA transcribed from the CMV promoter and for proper processing to generate the DENV 3 end, was obtained by overlapping PCR using the primers DEN2L5 and BGH3 and cloned in the previously described construct by using Fig. 1 . Strategy to assemble a DENV infectious cDNA clone as a BAC: A four-step cloning strategy, in which the overlapping cDNA fragments, termed overlapping PCR 1, PCR 2, PCR 3 and PCR 4, were sequentially cloned into the plasmid pBeloBAC11 and used to generate the infectious clone pBAC-DENV-FL. This plasmid includes the CMV promoter precisely joined to the DENV genome, followed by the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (RZ) and the bovine growth hormone termination and polyadenylation sequences (BGH). The genomic positions of the relevant restriction sites used for the assembly of the full-length cDNA clone are illustrated at the top.",

The EGFP reporter gene was successfully inserted into the intergenic region E-NS1, facilitating the elimination of the synonymous mutation located at position 2040 in the previously obtained infectious clone (Table 2) . After transfection of the EGFP-bearing DENV recombinant clone (pBAC-DENV-FL-GFP) in Vero cells and two passages in C6/36 cells, no cytopathic effect was observed (data not shown), suggesting that the recombinant virus was not successfully rescued. To further evaluate the rescue, RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatants at different passages of the virus and measured through RT-qPCR. Despite a moderate increase in the viral RNA levels at passage 2 in C6/36 cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5A) , viral RNA levels were lower than those obtained for the DENV infectious clone without a reporter (Fig. 3B) . Indeed, EGFP-positive cells were not detected in cell cultures inoculated with the supernatant from this passage (data not shown), indicating that no infectious virus was successfully rescued. To rule out a defect in the transcription from the CMV promoter or translation from the proper ORF, the expression of EGFP in Vero cells transfected with the pBAC-DENV-FL-GFP construct was evaluated. EGFP-positive cells were detected at 24 hpt (Fig. 5B) , suggesting that viral polyprotein, including the reporter EGFP, were properly translated. Finally, to assess the ability of the CMV-transcribed RNAs to autonomously replicate and generate negative-sense viral RNAs from the viral RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase and non-structural proteins activity, RT-qPCR for detecting negative-sense viral RNAs was performed and significant amounts of DENV negative-sense RNA were detected at 24 hpt (Fig. 5C) .",

DENV research has greatly benefited from these developments in several ways, ranging from the study of gene and protein function to vaccine generation and antiviral screening (Chao et al., 2012; Grant et al., 2011; Hsu et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2003; Kelly et al., 2010; Ng et al., 2007; Qing et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2007; Zou et al., 2011) . The rational design and construction of the DENV infectious clone as a BAC under the control of the CMV promoter described in the present study facilitated the successful rescue of DENV infectious particles, leading to plaque formation with phenotypic features similar to the parental strain. The standard deviation of the plaque diameter for rDENV-FL was smaller than that for the parental strain (DENV-2 NGC M2), reflecting the clonal origin of the rDENV-FL strain and suggesting its convenience for studying the effect of single mutations, where highly homogeneous viral populations are required. The parental strain showed a very attenuated phenotype, with plaque diameters significantly smaller than those of a highly adapted DENV strain (called DENV-2 NGC N2) (Suppl. Fig.  2 ). The parental (M2) and highly adapted (N2) DENV-2 NGC strains belong to the same original clinical isolation (New Guinea C); however, different passage histories, genetic drift and selection has led to sequence differences and extremely different phenotypes. The parental strain was chosen for cloning because of its smaller plaque size and the biological safety concerns for the potential derivation of a novel viral vector from the DENV infectious clone. The dramatic plaque size phenotype differences between these two closely related DENV strains reflect the usefulness of the infectious clone for studying virulence determinants and pathogenesis.",

Fusion proteins are crucial for deciphering viral intracellular trafficking during the early and late steps of infection . The error bars represent the SEM. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001. (Brandenburg and Zhuang, 2007) . However, in the present study, the fusion of the EGFP protein had a profoundly negative effect in virus rescue. Although autonomous viral genome replication was demonstrated for this clone after transfection, the detection of viral RNA (low levels) at passage 2 in C6/36 cells was not supported by the presence of the reporter protein. This disparity could be explained by the higher sensibility of the RT-qPCR to detect low levels of RNA molecules and the potential presence of a very low number of undetected fluorescent (EGFP) cells in those cultures at passage 2. The results suggest a negative impact of the fused EGFP in viral function (packaging, exit, or infectivity of the viral progeny). Undetectable or minimal levels of infectious virus in the supernatants of transfected cells have been previously observed when the reporter GFP gene was inserted into the anchored-C region of a DENV-2 infectious clone, and a significant defect in virus infectivity through the insertion of the reporter gene has also been suggested .",

Although that design avoided the negative effects associated with flavivirus E-NS1 separation, as the carboxyl-terminus of the envelope protein serves as a signal sequence required for the production of glycosylated NS1 protein (Falgout et al., 1989) , the duplication of the ER signal peptidase recognition site at E-NS1 resulted in the separation of the E and EGFP proteins and was therefore not useful for protein and/or virion tracking.",

            "text": "Recently, an infectious clone of DENV-2, expressing the EGFP reporter gene, was successfully constructed (Schoggins et al., 2012) . This molecular construct was a powerful tool for cell-based screening assays to identify antiviral molecules and their mechanisms of action. However, the EGFP protein was not fused to any viral structural protein and therefore, this EGFP-bearing DENV recombinant clone facilitated neither the tracking of individual particles outside the cell nor the examination the subcellular localization of any viral structural protein during the early and late steps of the DENV life cycle. Future attempts to mark at least one viral structural protein for tracking the course of infection should evaluate other positions for fusion of the reporter gene, including the carboxyl-terminus of the prM/M protein and the amino-terminal of the envelope protein.",

            "text": "Similarly, only two DENV infectious clones expressing the luciferase gene have been previously reported as excellent alternatives for quantitative analysis in the high-throughput screening of antiviral compounds and bioluminescence imaging of DENV infection in vivo (Schoggins et al., 2012) . These reporter-bearing infectious clones contain the 5 UTR, the sequence encoding the 38 N-terminal amino acids of the capsid protein, the hRLuc reporter and the FMDV2A sequence, followed by the full-length DENV ORF, which includes the complete capsid gene. The results from the present study, with a molecular clone constructed using a different strategy (pBAC-DENV-FL-LUC), confirm the correct expression of luciferase and the replicase complex function after transfection. The non-proportional increase between the Relative Luciferase Units and the negative-sense viral RNA could be explained by the principle of the methods, stability of the reporter protein or apoptotic cell death of the transfected cells at 36 hpt and later, leading to viral RNA decline, as it was observed for other constructs (DENV-derived replicons) (unpublished data). However, the absence of cytopathic effects and luciferase activity after one passage suggests that alterations of the carboxyl-terminus of the envelope protein through fusion with the reporter hRLuc negatively impacted virus morphogenesis or the infectivity of the viral progeny, consistent with the data obtained for the EGFP-bearing clone. Despite the negative impact on the production of virions, these results help to delimit future studies concerning the fusion of reporters to DENV structural genes.",
