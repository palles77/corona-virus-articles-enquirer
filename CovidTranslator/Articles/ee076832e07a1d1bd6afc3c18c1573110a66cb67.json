            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) was presumed to arise from mutations in the 3c of a ubiquitous and largely nonpathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). However, a recent study found that onethird of FIPV isolates have an intact 3c and suggested that it is not solely involved in FIP but is essential for intestinal replication. In order to confirm these assumptions, 27 fecal and 32 FIP coronavirus isolates were obtained from resident or adopted cats from a large metropolitan shelter during 2008-2009 and their 3a-c, E, and M genes sequenced. Forty percent of coronavirus isolates from FIP tissues had an intact 3c gene, while 60% had mutations that truncated the gene product. The 3c genes of fecal isolates from healthy cats were always intact. Coronavirus from FIP diseased tissues consistently induced FIP when given either oronasally or intraperitoneally (i.p.), regardless of the functional status of their 3c genes, thus confirming them to be FIPVs. In contrast, fecal isolates from healthy cats were infectious following oronasal infection and shed at high levels in feces without causing disease, as expected for FECVs. Only one in three cats shed FECV in the feces following i.p. infection, indicating that FECVs can replicate systemically, but with difficulty. FIPVs having a mutated 3c were not shed in the feces following either oronasal or i.p. inoculation, while FIPVs with intact 3c genes were shed in the feces following oronasal but not i.p. inoculation. Therefore, an intact 3c appears to be essential for intestinal replication. Although FIPVs with an intact 3c were shed in the feces following oronasal inoculation, fecal virus from these cats was not infectious for other cats. Attempts to identify potential FIP mutations in the 3a, 3b, E, and M were negative. However, the 3c gene of FIPVs, even though appearing intact, contained many more nonsynonymous amino acid changes in the 3 one-third of the 3c protein than FECVs. An attempt to trace FIPV isolates back to enteric strains existing in the shelter was only partially successful due to the large region over which shelter cats and kittens originated, housing conditions prior to acquisition, and rapid movement through the shelter. No evidence could be found to support a recent theory that FIPVs and FECVs are genetically distinct.",

FECV mutants that attain the FIP biotype have gained tropism for macrophages (reviewed Pedersen, 2009 ). This altered tropism allows the virus to stray from its normal host cell (mature intestinal epithelium) and become a systemic pathogen of macrophages, a cell type that is at the core of both innate and adaptive immunity. The type and strength of immune responses to this macrophage infection is thought to dictate whether or not a cat becomes diseased, and if diseased, the form it takes (reviewed Pedersen, 2009) .",

            "text": "Mutations that increase macrophage tropism were originally thought to reside solely in the 3c gene, to work by altering the size of the gene product, and to be unique to each cat dying of FIP (Vennema et al., 1998; Pedersen et al., 2009) . The 3c is one of 11 genes in the feline coronavirus genome and it is uncertain whether it is an integral part of the virion and its exact function in the virus life-cycle. It encodes a triple-spanning membrane protein that is similar in hydropathic profile, but not sequence, to the M protein (Oostra et al., 2006) . Although the basic role of internal mutation endures, the essential role of 3c mutations in the FECV to FIPV conversion has been questioned. It is now apparent that one-third or more of FIPV isolates have 3c genes that are intact, which is the case for all FECVs (Chang et al., 2010) . Based on their findings, Chang and colleagues (2010) concluded that whereas an intact 3c is essential for intestinal replication, functional mutations in 3c are not essential for increased macrophage tropism and FIP. However, neither of these conclusions was tested by experimental cat inoculation studies. Rather, the disease potential (biotype) of their coronavirus isolates was defined by their origins, i.e., FECV if they were found in feces and FIPVs if they were isolated from diseased tissues. The implications of these findings go beyond the nature of the FIPV mutation(s). If FIPVs with intact 3c can replicate in the intestine, they may also transmit cat-to-cat. This is counter to the current corollary that FIPV is rarely if ever transmitted horizontally and that cats with FIP are therefore not risks for other cats (reviewed by Pedersen, 2009; Pedersen et al., 2009) .",

The FECV and FIPV isolates used in this study were obtained from a large metropolitan shelter in San Francisco that receives kittens and adult cats from the Bay Area. The shelter staff educates owners about the health problems that may occur in their new pet, with emphasis on serious diseases such as FIP. Owners are also encouraged to seek veterinary care from the shelter staff or private veterinarians if FIP or signs of FIP occur. As a result of these practices, many of the FIP cases among adoptees come to the attention of the shelter staff. Therefore, this collaboration yielded a large number of both FIPV and FECV isolates. The E, M, 3a-c genes were then sequenced and used to categorize the various isolates for their 3c gene status. A subset of these genetically characterized isolates were then used to infect laboratory cats both oronasally and by the i.p. route to determine their disease potential and ability to replicate in the intestine. Additional studies were also conducted on isolates obtained after animal passage.",

Foster caregivers house one to several litters of kittens at a time until they attain the necessary age and weight for spaying or castration (9-12 weeks and 0.9-1.0 kg), at which time they are returned to the SF SPCA shelter. There is a biphasic peak in kitten numbers in the shelter with the first peak in spring, a decrease in August and September and a second wave around October through December. Kitten numbers decrease to very low levels during the winter (January to March/early April). This seasonal rush causes crowding at all levels of the kitten relinquishment/adoption cycle and the incidence of coronavirus infection correlates with Table 1 Source of inocula used in experiments.",

Isolates from cats SFS-20 and -21 were identical, thus yielding 18 unique mutations. All these mutations involved the creation of premature stop codons (10/18) or frame shifts (8/18) causing truncation of the 3c product. Almost all of these mutations were unique to the cat from which it was obtained (Fig. 1) . Four of 19 of these tissue extracts also contained an intact 3c variant 15, 20, and 21) . One of the 19FIP isolates (SFS-11) had a mutation that abolished the stop/start codon at the 3b/3c junction and yielded an extended 3b protein and no 3c product (Fig. 1 ). This isolate also had two deletion mutations in 3c (Fig. 1) . Similar deletion mutations occurring downstream of a premature stop codon were also observed in three other FIPV isolates (SFS-03, 14, and 23). One FIPV isolate (SFS-01) had a premature stop code in 3a, while isolate SFS-18 had a 3-nucleotide deletion in the M gene (Fig. 1) . The remaining 11/32 (34.4%) FIP tissue isolates had intact 3c genes and normal sized transcripts for 3a, b, E, and M.",

Following infection with a mixture of isolates, only one or two strains were associated with disease and the infecting strain(s) often varied from cat to cat among an experimental group (Fig. 5) The infecting strain(s) were either identical to the strain(s) found in the inoculum or a recombinant.

In contrast, the close relatedness of coronavirus strains within clades I, III, and especially IV, indicated that each originated from a common source. This common origin was supported by the presence of characteristic mutations in each of these three clades (see Section 3.5). Cats infected with clades I and III entered the shelter over a 6 month period in 2008, while clade IV isolates were collected over a 6 month period in 2009, again suggesting that these cats were infected from three different sources.",

(2010) on the role of the 3c gene, except that the biotypes of coronavirus isolates from both healthy and FIP diseased cats were confirmed by infection of laboratory cats. Animal inoculation studies confirmed the basic conclusions of Chang et al. (2010) , but with some modifications. Their first conclusion was that an intact 3c was essential for intestinal replication. Indeed, all FECVs studied had intact 3c genes and were infectious by the oronasal Fig. 5 .

Isolates from these cats were either identical to those present in lesional tissues of cats SFS-10 and SFS-16 in the inoculum or recombinants of both strains. (B) Coronavirus isolates from diseased tissues of cats experimentally infected with inoculum m3c-1 (Expt. 3B).

However, one of three cats infected i.p. with FECVs did shed virus from the feces, indicating that FECVs could reach the gut from the peritoneal cavity, but with some difficulty. Therefore, intestinal vs. macrophage tropism of FECVs may be relative rather than absolute. A second conclusion of Chang et al. (2010) was that mutations in 3c were not essential to cause FIP. Indeed, FIPVs with intact and functionally mutated 3c genes were equally capable of causing FIP when given by either oronasal or i.p. routes. Therefore, truncating mutations of 3c were not essential in causing FIP. Chang et al. (2010) also predicted that FIPVs with truncated 3c genes would not infect the intestine following oral infection and would not be shed in the feces. Although true for most isolates, there was again one exception. A 3c double deletion mutant (ddFIPV) was shed from the gut following oral infection with the m3c-1 inoculum. However, a fecal extract from laboratory cats shedding this particular mutant was not infectious for laboratory cats by the oronasal route. It is noteworthy that the original inoculum containing ddFIPV also contained a variant with an intact 3c gene. This variant was no longer detected in feces after passage in laboratory cats. It is possible that ddFIPV used this variant as a helper for intestinal replication during its initial passage in laboratory cats.",

The surprising finding in the present study was the lack of infectivity of coronaviruses that were shed in the feces of cats that were infected oronasally with FIPVs possessing an intact 3c. This lack of infectivity also applied to the novel double-deletion 3c mutant that appeared in the tissues and feces of cats infected with the m3c-1 inoculum and to a fecal virus from a cat with naturally acquired FIP that possessed the same intact 3c as the lesional virus. The reason for this lack of infectivity cannot be explained at this time, but is another example of the complexities of FIP pathogenesis. However, these findings support one corollary of the internal mutation theory, i.e., cats with FIP do not appear to effectively transmit FIP horizontally to other cats (Pedersen, 2009 ). 6 .

            "text": "It is generally assumed that FECVs are tropic for the mature intestinal epithelium, while FIPVs are tropic for macrophages. This implies that FECV infection is entirely contained within the intestinal tract. However, several studies have shown that FECV infection has both an intestinal and a systemic phase, and that the systemic phase involves monocyte-macrophages (Kipar et al., 2010; Vogel et al., 2010) . This again suggests that intestinal and monocytemacrophage tropisms of FECVs and FIPVs are relative and not absolute. This would explain how FECV was able to reach the intestinal epithelium in one of three cats infected with FECV by the i.p. route. If FECVs can replicate briefly in macrophage/monocytes, then the mutational transformation of an FECV to an FIPV may actually occur in monocyte-macrophages rather than intestinal epithelial cells. Such a scenario takes into account the high mutability of FECV and FIPV both within and between cats ). The mutation rate may also be greater during replication in macrophages than intestinal epithelial cells, as indicated by the present study. High mutability would provide ample opportunity for positive selection for macrophage tropism. The better and longer an FECV can survive in macrophages following primary or secondary infections, the more adapted to macrophage growth it would become and the more virulent in terms of FIP. Indeed, Stoddart and Scott (1989) demonstrated that the ability of an FIPV to replicate in macrophages increased with its virulence for cats. Mutational events (SNPs, insertions, deletions) in the present study were also found to be much more common in FIPVs than FECVs both in natural and experimental infections, indicating that FIPVs are under much more mutational pressure than FECVs.",

            "text": "The role of antibodies in FIPV infection and replication in macrophages needs to be considered as well. The timing of acquisition of serum antibodies in experimental FIPV, either by passive or active immunization, always coincides with the onset of disease (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980) . Antibodies greatly enhance the uptake and replication of coronavirus in macrophages and contribute to subsequent disease signs through an arthus type reaction (Jacobse-Geels et al., 1982; Olsen et al., 1992; Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Pedersen, 1986; Weiss and Scott, 1981) . FIPV specific antibodies allow the mutant coronavirus an alternative pathway to enter macrophages, i.e., by Fc receptors. Therefore, the fate of the host cat may be linked to its ability to contain primary FECV replication in monocyte-macrophages before antibodies appear. In the present study, as with other studies of experimental FIP infection (reviewed Pedersen, 2009 ), a proportion of cats appear to resist experimental FIPV infection from the onset. The importance of an intact immune system in this initial containment has been demonstrated in a previous study using FECV infection of aged FIV infected cats and their non-infected siblings (Poland et al., 1996) . There also appears to be a genetic component to FIP susceptibility .",

A comparison 3a-c, E, and M nucleotide and amino acid sequences of FECVs and FIPVs in the present study also failed to find any consistent differences in the 3a, 3b, E, and M gene sequences or products that would implicate these genes in FIP. One FIPV isolate (SFS-01) in the present study had a premature stop codon in the region overlapping 3a, b, another (SFS-11) had a mutation that resulted in an extended 3b protein and no 3c product, and two FIPV isolates had 3 nt and 27 nt deletions in the M protein. The 7a and 7b genes and their products were not studied herein, because isolates of both FECVs and FIPVs with significant mutations have been found to coexist in nature (Kennedy et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2009) . Furthermore, deletion of 7b causes FIPVs to become avirulent (Herrewegh et al., 1995) . Finally, significant mutations in 7a and 7b were not observed in a previous comparison of FIPVs and FECVs . Previous studies have also failed to implicate the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) genes in the FECV to FIPV biotype conversion (Battilani et al., 2010; Vennema et al., 1998) . It is also possible that alternative FIP causing mutations may exist in the first two open reading frames comprising the replicase genes, which collectively make up more than two-thirds of the genome. However, the replicase tends to be highly conserved and mutations in these genes would be expected to inhibit virus replication and decrease virulence.",

            "text": "Although a singular importance of 3c mutations in the evolution of FIPVs has been questioned (Chang et al., 2010) , such a conclusion may be premature in light of what is now known about variants. Although 60% of FIPVs have a functionally mutated 3c, such mutants often coexist with intact 3c variants in the same lesions. The opposite situation is also true in some cats. The pressure to progressively truncate 3c is also evident upon experimental cat passage . These observations suggest that mutations ultimately causing FIP do not start with the acquisition of premature stop codons, or frame shifting deletions and insertions that alter the size of the 3c product. FIPV causing isolates with intact 3c genes in the present study had four times more unique non-synonymous amino acid mutations in the 3 one-third of their 3c protein than FECVs. Although, Chang et al. (2010) reported no differences between 3c of their FECVs and FIPVs with intact 3c, a comparison of their FECV and FIPV 3c gene sequences obtained from GenBank also showed a similar trend from amino acid positions 160 to 240 of the 3c protein. The number of predicted non-synonymous amino acid substitutions in this region in 26 of their FECVs was 0.65/isolate compared to 2.0/isolate for 10 of their FIPV isolates. However, these differences may reflect a higher replication rate in macrophages vs. intestinal epithelial cells and play no role in FIP virulence. The ultimate answer as to the nature of FIP causing mutations may require, as suggested by Chang et al. (2011) , the creation of infectious molecular clones of the basic feline enteric coronavirus by forward or reverse genetic manipulations, site directed mutagenesis to mimic various genotypes, and animal inoculation studies to confirm the resultant phenotype. Unfortunately, a true FECV has not been adapted to cell culture and most FIPVs also cannot be grown in vitro and the essential reagents are still missing.",

These observations highlight essential differences in the dynamics of coronavirus infection in shelters vs. catteries or stable multi-cat environments. Catteries and stable multi-cat environments usually have one major enzootic strain of coronavirus that persists over long periods of time (Addie et al., 2003; Herrewegh et al., 1997; Pedersen et al., 2009; Poland et al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1998) , even in the face of exposure to other strains (Addie et al., 2003; Herrewegh et al., 1997) . Most previous studies on the origin of FIP viruses have involved catteries and multi-cat environments, which explain why FIP viruses have been genetically linked to enteric coronaviruses in the same environments (Hickman et al., 1995; Pedersen et al., 2009; Poland et al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1998) .",

They concluded that FIP virus isolates were genetically distinguishable from enteric type coronaviruses in the shelter based on combinations of five specific amino acids at positions 108, 120, 138, 163, and 199 in the M protein. Two of these sequences, YIVAL (I) or YIIAL (II), were purportedly found in all cats with FIP, while isolates from healthy coronavirus infected cats were HIIVI (III), HIIVL (IV), HVIAL (V), or YVVAL (VI), and uncommonly YIVAL (I). In agreement with Chang et al. (2011) , the present results confirmed that these particular amino acid sequences in M have no value in distinguishing FECVs from FIPVs.

(2009) was that FCoV populations in a shelter are changing continually depending on the age of cats at the time of acquisition and their prior environmental exposure history. In order to trace the origins of FIP viruses in cats that have passed through shelters, one must sample feces prior to the usual age of primary coronavirus infection (9-10 weeks of age; Pedersen et al., 2008) and in subsequent exposure situations preceding the development of FIP.",
