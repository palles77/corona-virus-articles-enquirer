Over this period protein A-gold has been used extensively as a reagent for binding immunoglobulins from many mammalian species. Due to the broad reactivity of the probe and the ease of preparation, protein \u0391-gold remains a popular choice as an immunolabel. The aim of this chapter is to discuss the potential problems associated with protein \u0391-gold as stated in the literature and as recog nized in this laboratory. To understand the potential difficulties, it is nec essary first to discuss the techniques involved with the preparation of colloidal gold and protein \u0391-colloidal gold conjugates.",

The gold colloid is formed from micromolecular units (nuclei) and the increase in particle size is dependent on the rate of forma tion of nuclei and the rate of crystal growth. Thus, by controlling the reduction of tetrachloroauric acid, gold probes of varying diameters can be produced. Reduction with white phosphorus, ascorbic acid, or triso dium citrate, for example, produces gold particles with average diameters of 5, 12, and 16 nm, respectively (Slot and Geuze, 1981) .

If electrolytes are added, the ion layers of the particles are compressed and so the critical \"cohesion\" distance is reduced, thereby facilitating flocculation. It has been recognized since 1901 (Zsig mondy, 1901) that gold particles can be stabilized in solution by the addi tion of proteins. One of the more successful of such proteins is Staphylo coccus aureus coat protein A. The complexing of protein A (as with other proteins) to colloidal gold involves electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged surface of gold particles and positively charged groups of the proteins. It is generally accepted that the protein is attracted into the action radius of van der Waals-London attractive forces and there firmly binds to the surface of the gold particles.",

Although the isoelectric point for protein A is 5.1, complexes are generally produced at a pH range of 5.9 to 6.2. How ever, adequate protein binding can be obtained at a pH between 5 and 6 (Slot and Geuze, 1981) ; the overall bioactivity and stabilization do not appear to be compromised in such complexes. The amount of protein A required for stabilization of colloidal gold is generally determined by the technique described by Zsigmondy and Thiessen (1925) . The test results in a color change of the colloidal gold solution from orange-red to blue when there is incomplete stabilization. The minimum amount of protein A required to prevent this effect is taken as an estimation for the stabiliza tion of the gold solution. It is common practice to add 10 to 100% excess protein A to the solution to ensure stabilization Geuze, 1981, 1985) . The protein A complex is then stored in a buffer (e.g., phosphatebuffered saline, PBS) containing an excess of unrelated protein such as bovine serum albumin (BSA); this further stabilizes the gold complex.",

The antigenic site within or on the specimen is revealed (indirectly) by the addition of a primary antibody. The excess antibody is removed and protein \u0391-gold added. Protein A has two functional Fc binding regions (Langone, 1982) , which interact predominantly at the CH 2 and CH 3 do mains of the Fc region of the antibody (Forsgren and Sj\u00f6quist, 1966) . The binding is strong in most IgG classes of several mammalian species such as human, rabbit, guinea pig, and dog; weaker with IgG classes from horse, cow, and mouse; and weakest in IgG from goat, sheep, rat, and chicken (Forsgren and Sj\u00f6quist, 1966; Kronvall et al., 1970 Kronvall et al., , 1974 Biberfeld et al., 1975; Lindmark et al., 1983) . Binding to different classes of IgG, human IgA, and IgE and IgM from various species has also been shown (Goudswaard et al., 1978; Langone, 1982; Lindmark et al., 1983) . It is obvious from the above that antibodies used in protein \u0391-gold proce dures should be generated from species which produce high-affinity anti body-protein A complexes. Furthermore, the antibodies should be of the one class, that is, they should be affinity-purified or monoclonal antibodies.",

When the gold particles vary in size, i.e., their coef ficient of variation (CV) is greater than 15% (Slot and Geuze, 1985) , the solutions are considered polydispersive in size; when the CV is less than 15% they are referred to as monodispersive. The production of monodispersive colloidal gold is dependent on the method for synthesis (Han dley, 1989) and subsequent treatment (Bendayan, 1984) . The ability to produce solutions of monodispersive gold particles is of paramount im portance in multiple-labeling immunoelectron microscopy. The advantage of protein A is that it can be readily complexed to a gold probe of any size and possesses an affinity for most IgG of most mammals. Protein \u0391-gold probes therefore provide a potential means whereby colocalization of antigens within a single sample can be achieved. In the literature there are numerous reports which claim success in double labeling of anti gens within/on the one biological section. The techniques include colocal- ization of antigens on one face of a section with probes of different sizes (Geuze et al, 1981; Roth, 1982; Hisano et al, 1984) or the labeling of both faces of a section (Bendayan, 1982) .",

From a practical viewpoint, affinity-purified and monoclonal antibodies generally yield specific labeling with a clean background ( Fig.  2.1a) . The labeling in Fig. 2 .1b, on the other hand, was produced with a whole porcine serum as the primary antibody. Although 1% BSA was used to minimize nonspecific labeling (as per Fig. 2.1a) , the background in Fig. 2 .1b was considerably greater. An explanation for this is that the use of whole serum (containing numerous natural antibodies, targeted an tibodies, and antibodies to any carrier molecules or extraneous material carried over or used in the immunization) with protein \u0391-gold produces many immunocomplexes. The overall effect can result in the adsorption of unwanted antibodies and subsequent labeling of various cellular con stituents in addition to the targeted antigen. If normal serum is used to block nonspecific binding of primary antibodies to the reactive sites of tissues, an effect similar to that described above may occur. In many instances the problem of such nonspecific binding may be reduced by decreasing the effective antibody concentration. If the studies involve in fectious agents, hormones, or the like (i.e., cause-and-effect experi ments), then nonspecific staining can be further reduced by preadsorption of the serum with the normal (nonexperimental) biological tissue.",

The small probes (= 3 nm) have approximately one associated protein A molecule, whereas larger probes (= 15 nm) can adsorb -60 such molecules (Roth, 1982) . If the larger of the gold probes is used for the visualization of the first antigen, many potential Fc binding sites (unoccupied protein A) are available for the second immunoglobulin and significant cross-contamination may therefore result. If excess free protein A is added, the primary antibody-protein A interactions may reach saturation and so minimize interactions with secondary protein A-gold probes. The binding of secondary antibodies to the existing pro tein A Fc binding sites should not be recognized by the secondary protein A-gold probe as it is assumed that IgG can bind only one protein A mole cule. Cross-contamination can still occur, however, via interactions with the Fab regions of IgG. If cross-contamination is a continued problem, alternative techniques to the protein A method should be investigated.

The stabilization of colloidal gold therefore does not ensure its saturation. It is because of this that excess unrelated protein (for example, BSA) is (1 : 10) . N o stabilizer was included within the added to these protein-gold complexes; the subsequent complex is then assumed to be saturated. However, it would appear that some immuno gold labeling patterns are independent of protein-protein interactions and result from interactions between specimen constituents and the gold par ticles (Behnke et al., 1986) . The occurrence of such nonspecific binding is obvious in whole cytoskeletons (Fig. 2.4a ) and thick polyethylene glycolextracted sections (A. D. Hyatt, unpublished observations) . Strategies in colloidal gold labeling of cytoskeletal elements are discussed at length by Birrell and Griffith (1989) . Nonspecific binding is attributed to electro static interactions between exposed areas on the gold particles (areas of negative charge) and cationic structures within the specimen (Behnke et al., 1986) .",

Birrell et al. found that 5-nm gold particles produced by the trisodium citrate-tannic acid method exhibited a higher degree of nonspecificity than particles of simi lar size produced by other methods. This nonspecificity was attributed to the chemical agents used in colloidal gold production (Birrell et al., 1987) ; for example, colloidal gold produced by the white phosphorus method was found to contain phosphate groups. Tannic acid may therefore also be a source of contamination for colloidal gold produced by the trisodium citrate-tannic acid procedure (Birrell et al., 1987; Birrell and Griffith, 1989) . Such contaminants on gold particles may, as with tannic acid, form a series of complex interactions with biological specimens, particularly those fixed with an aldehyde and/or Os0 4 (Simionescu and Simionescu, 1976) . Observations in this laboratory and by Birrell et al. (1987) and Bir rell and Griffith (1989) that nonspecific labeling is more pronounced with smaller probes may be explained by the greater accessibility of these probes to tissue constituents within open and/or permeabilized specimens.",
