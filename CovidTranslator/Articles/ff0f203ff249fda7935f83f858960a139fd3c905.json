The term \"infection\" is derived from the Latin inficere meaning to taint. What is tainted is the coherence of the metaself (self + symbiotes-cf. Chapter 5) and the metastable functioning of this terrain. From this unitary definition, we derive the actors in the dyad: the nonself organism (the infector) and the terrain of the aggressed organism(s) (the infected). Infections are the dynamic of the virulence of the infector relative to the adaptive capabilities of the infected. The greater the virulence is, and the less competent adaptive capabilities are, the greater the risk of infection. Since the time of Koch and Pasteur, the exclusive line of evaluation and treatment has been the infector, with no consideration for the terrain of the infected. This is like while having a hole in one's roof and clogged gutters on a rainy day, focusing on dispersing rain clouds rather than fixing the house.",

Due to the constant aggression on the nasal airway, it has a high turnover rate and is subjected to permanent, intermittent relative adaptive congestion, one nostril alternating with the other. 2 The nasal airway has three primary functions: respiration, defense, and olfaction. Respiration is divided into inspiration and expiration. The functions of the mucosa during inspiration are three: (1) determination of air quality, (2) humidification, and (3) filtration of air. The purposes of exhalation are two: (1) egress of carbon dioxide (acid-base balance) and (2) intonation of speech. The requirements of defense arise from the first function of respiration. 3 The purpose of olfaction is to determine information crucial to the survival of the organisms: location and integrity of foods, 4 the presence of organism of the same or different species, and reproduction. 5, 6 ANS Parasympathetic activity is implicated in the passive nutritive congestion of the sinuses. 7 This allows for this tissue to maintain its high rate of turnover. Because it is inefficient to congest both sinuses at the same time, the organism alternates the relative tonus of para and alpha. For example, the right nostril will be congested (para > alpha) for repair and growth, while the left is open (para=alpha).

A majority of cases resolve without treatment. 17 In chronic sinusitis, or, chronic recurrent sinusitis, antibiotics are not effective in resolving the recidivistic nature of the infection. 18 Considering the long-term risk of cancer in patients correlating with total life-time utilization of antibiotics, [19] [20] [21] we don't recommend antibiotics as an exclusive method of treating chronic recurrent sinusitis. Given the risk of evolution of chronic sinusitis to allergic (extrinsic) asthma (cf. The Theory of Endobiogeny, Volume 3, Chapter 2), it become all the more capital to treat the underlying precritical terrain. 22 According to the theory of endobiogeny, the order of priority and intensity of therapy in sinusitis is at variance with that of rhinopharyngitis due to the location and function and accessibility of the sinuses. The top areas of focus are the sinuses and gallbladder. ",

Among the infectious diseases presented here, few have been shown to be effectively managed with antibiotics as first-line treatment in uncomplicated cases. There is, then a quandary which the physician faces. To use antibiotics may induce harm and is likely not effective. To not treat leaves the patient suffering and is a burden on the family, work and thus on society as a whole. If not this, then what to use? We have found in our nearly five decades of clinical practice the rational clinical usage of medicinal plants quite effective. They can be applied symptomatically, to the critical terrain, or precritical terrain to prevent recurrent infections. The approach laid out involves both anti-infectious treatments and drainage, but also regulation of the neuroendocrine determinants of the infectious terrain. In the out-patient population, this approach proves efficient and compassionate to alleviate the burden faced by the patient.",
