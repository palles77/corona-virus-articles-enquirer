            "text": "Autophagy and apoptosis play significant roles in PRRSV infection and replication. However, the interaction between these 2 processes in PRRSV replication is still far from been completely understood. In our studies, the exposure of MARC-145 cells to PRRSV confirmed the activation of autophagy and subsequent induction of apoptosis. The inhibition of autophagy by 3methyladenine (3-MA) caused a significant increase in PRRSV-induced apoptosis, showing a potential connection between both mechanisms. Moreover, we observed an increase in Bad expression (a pro-apoptotic protein) and Beclin1 (an autophagy regulator) in virus-infected cells up to 36h. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed the formation of Bad and Beclin1 complex in PRRSV infected cells. Accordingly, Bad co-localized with Beclin1 in MARC-145 infected cells. Knockdown of Beclin1 significantly decreased PRRSV replication and PRRSV-induced autophagy, while Bad silencing resulted in increased autophagy and enhanced viral replication. Furthermore, PRRSV infection phosphorylated Bad (Ser112) to promote cellular survival. These results demonstrate that autophagy can favor PRRSV replication by postponing apoptosis through the formation of a Bad-Beclin1 complex.",

            "text": "The swine industry suffers huge economic losses through porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) that causes reproductive failure, respiratory distress, high morbidity and mortality in pigs of all ages. Despite years of extensive research in pathogenesis of PRRSV, the host factors and host species/cells involved are poorly understood. The two evolutionarily conserved biological processes, autophagy and apoptosis, are essential for development, tissue homeostasis and their imbalance causes disease. Autophagy is recognized both as a unique cell death pathway and as an adaptation to various stresses that supports cell growth and survival. On the other hand, apoptosis is widely regarded as a major mechanism of programmed cell death. 1 There are several proofs to believe that the fate of cells is differentially affected by autophagy and apoptosis, which can antagonize or assist each other under certain circumstances. Autophagy may acts as an adaptive response to suppress cell death, but can also stimulate autophagic cell death. 2, 3 Moreover, several important signaling pathways such as mTOR, DAPK, Beclin1 and caspases, mediate the complex cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis that further enlightens its implications in disease and pathogen interactions. Furthermore, it has been reported that autophagy and apoptosis regulate virus-host interactions, where the virus-induced apoptotic cell death is inhibited by autophagy, while apoptosis-associated signal activation shuts off the autophagic process. A similar case is that of HTLV-1 Tax protein-induced autophagy, which contributes to protect human astroglioma cells from death receptor-mediated apoptosis. 4 Another study demonstrates a significant increase in apoptotic cell death in autophagy-deficient cells infected with influenza A virus (IAV) that was exacerbated by the virus-encoded protein M2. 5 However, in some cases autophagy acts as a process of programmed cell death where autophagy-relevant proteins may participate in inducing apoptosis. This has been elucidated by Beclin1 protein that can promote autophagosome initiation. Silencing of Beclin1protein expression resulted in a decreased percentage of early and late apoptotic cells in the late stage of ECTV-MOS infection in L929 cells. 6 Additionally, the results of Espert et al. showed that 3-MA, an inhibitor of autophagy, totally inhibited Env-mediated cell death, and autophagy was also a prerequisite for Env-induced activation of the apoptotic pathway through CXCR4. 7 It has been demonstrated that HP-PRRSV has the capacity to exploit autophagy and apoptosis for its replication. 8, 9 However, interpreting the functional interaction between autophagy and apoptosis that service PRRSV replication can greatly improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of PRRSV infection. Therefore, in present study cell autophagy and apoptosis were induced in MARC-145 cells at different stages of viral life cycle that showed autophagy can postpone apoptotic cell death induced by PRRSV infection. Moreover, we demonstrated that PRRSV-induced autophagy in MARC145 cells was regulated by Bad and Beclin1 interaction through phosphorylation.",

Some previous researches have shown that autophagy and anti-apoptosis are stimulated by PRRSV in the early infection stage and are required for PRRSV replication. 8, 9 Whether PRRSV can delineate the temporal relationship between autophagy and apoptosis to facilitate PRRSV replication and viral progeny production needs to be determined. An increase was observed in autophagiclike vesicles formation after 12 hpi and reached its peak at 36 hpi with a gradual disappearance till 48hpi ( Fig. 2A) . Further quantitative analyses also demonstrated the change of autophagosome formation (Fig. 2B) . Moreover, we also observed that there was no significant change in membrane structure, mitochondria or nucleus at 12h post PRRSV infection compared to uninfected cells, while a series of apoptotic phenomenon, such as nuclear fragmentation, cytoplasmic shrinkage and clusters of vacuoles in the cytoplasm were observed in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells at 24, 36 and 48hpi. Meanwhile, we found the expression of anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-xl was increased from 24hpi to 36hpi and then began to decrease at 48hpi, which might correlate to increased apoptotic cell death. The switch between autophagy and apoptosis was not clearly defined. The above results in combination conclude that PRRSV-induced autophagy did not coincide with apoptosis appearance and the promotion of PRRSV replication might be due to the autophagic anti-apoptotic function or inhibition of cell apoptosis.",

The result showed in Figure 3A -B that the inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA increased the number of apoptotic cells compared to uninfected and infected MARC-145 cells by flow cytometry analysis with Annexin V-APC/7ADD whereas cells treated by Rapamycin, an autophagy activator, did not affect cell viability.

We observed that the expression of Bad mRNA increased with the progression of PRRSV infection, while PRRSV infection progressively stimulated Beclin1 expression from 6hpi to 36hpi that it declined thereafter at 48hpi (Fig. 4A) . Western blot analysis of Bad protein did not expose significant changes in its expression level during PRRSV infection in MARC-145 cells, in contrast, PRRSV infection robustly increased Beclin1 protein expression with maximal production at 36hpi (Fig. 4B-C) . However, intracellular distribution of Bad protein in control and infected MARC-145 cells varied as determined by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4D) . Non-infected MARC-145 cells release diffused localization of Bad. Meanwhile, the localization of Bad was almost strongly transferred into the cytoplasmic virus replication in MARC-145 cells at 36h hpi. The different distribution of Bad suggested its involvement in PRRSV replication. Together, these results indicate that upregulation of Beclin1 expression and the intracellular distribution of Bad protein mediated by PRRSV infection may participate in autophagy-inhibited cell apoptosis and PRRSV replication.",

Western blot assay revealed an increase of p-Bad (S112) up to 36hpi (Fig. 6C) , suggesting that Bad phosphorylation plays a critical role in PRRSV-inducted autophagy, although Bad phosphorylation in other sites and its role for affecting Beclin1 binding needs to be detected.",

In addition, M2, HA and NS1 proteins of influenza A virus contributed to induce cell autophagy 19, 20 ; and influenza A virus infection inhibited apoptosis at the early stage of infection and induced the apoptotic cell deaths at the late stage of infection for its own replication. 21, 22 The interaction between autophagy and apoptosis has been shown to involve in influenza A virus infection. Influenza A virus-infected apoptotic cell deaths were significantly enhanced in the autophagy-deficient cells; on the other hand, influenza A virus encodes PB1-F2 that could indirectly suppress autophagy by regulating M2 and promoting apoptosis at the terminal stage of infection. 23, 24 PRRSV, a highly mutable virus, causes acute respiratory disease and reproduction failure in pigs with complex mechanisms of pathogenesis, resulting in unavailability of reliable vaccines and lesser success for preventing PRRSV infection. Recently, a number of evidences have shown that PRRSV replication was able to be regulated by autophagy and apoptosis in order to promote viral replication through its replication complex or regulating mitochondria-mediated pathway and so on. 25, 26 Therefore, the understanding of the molecular processes contributing to autophagy and apoptosis and investigation of the mechanisms mediating the cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis in PRRSV infection are necessary.",

            "text": "Our results show that PRRSV infection upregulates Bad and Beclin1 expression at the transcriptional level, while the expression of Bad protein reveals changes during the PRRSV replication cycle in MARC-145 cells. The punctate accumulation at the round of PRRSV replication site in the cytosol, compared with mock-infection cells where Bad was diffusely localized in the mitochondrial membrane, consistent with the research. 36 These results raise a question as to whether Bad is involved in PRRSV-induced autophagy. The knockdown assays and immunofluorescent staining utilized in the present study demonstrate the increase in expression of LC3-II and punctate accumulation of LC3 by Bad knockdown in PRRSV infected cells as compared to SiBeclin1 (SiNC) treated cells which shows that Bad is able to regulate PRRSV-induced autophagy in MARC-145 cells. It has been shown that Beclin1 is an autophagy protein with a BH3-only domain and can participate in regulating autophagy and apoptosis, 37-39 we observed co-immunoprecipitation between endogenous Beclin1 and Bcl2 or Bad in PRRSV infected MARC-145 cells where Bad was found to colocalize with Beclin1 through confocal microscopy analysis, which suggests that not only the dissociation of Beclin1/Bcl2 is important for PRRSV-induced autophagy but Bad and Beclin1 complex may also play a role in PRRSV infection. In addition, the interaction between Bax and Beclin1 reduced in PRRSV infection may lead to reveal that Bax is able to reduce autophagosome formation. 40, 41 Our results also showed that Bad phosphorylation (S112) could be enhanced during PRRSV infection. Previous reports have shown that pro-survival Bcl2 family members affect autophagy only indirectly by inhibiting Bax and Bak, indicating that Bcl2 and/or Bclxl that directly bind to the BH3 domain of Beclin1 may not inhibit autophagy 42 ; on the other hand, Bad phosphorylation has a prosurvival function and reduces the binding of Bad and BCL2/Bcl-xl. PRRSV infection triggers Bad phosphorylation and results in regulating the interaction between Bad and Beclin1. Akt and ERK1/2 have been reported to function as physiologic Bad kinases and were required for PRRSV infection, 29, 43, 44 indicating that the interaction among Bad, Beclin1, Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathway plays an important role for PRRSV infection.",
