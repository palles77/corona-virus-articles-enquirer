To understand the role of the nucleocapsid protein in the viral life cycle, the protein was overexpressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. The purified N protein was well folded and was predominantly alpha-helical. Deletion analysis revealed that the C-terminal unfolded region of the N protein was involved in RNA binding. Furthermore, the N protein could be phosphorylated in vitro by Nicotiana benthamiana plant sap and by purified recombinant kinases such as protein kinase CK2 and calcium-dependent protein kinase. This is the first report of phoshphorylation of a nucleocapsid protein in the family Bunyaviridae. The possible implications of the present findings for the viral life cycle are discussed.",

It binds to single-stranded RNA in a nonsequence-specific manner, but not to double-stranded RNA [34] . However, compared to the N protein of hantaviruses, the TSWV N protein is much smaller, and the RNAbinding domain has not been clearly defined. It has been shown to interact homotypically in vitro and in vivo [37, 38, 42] . The TSWV N protein exists as multimers or aggregates of increasing molecular mass. Analysis of deletion and site-specific mutants of TSWV N protein has revealed that the subunits can interact in a head-to-tail manner, and two conserved phenylalanine residues (F242 and F246) are crucial for this interaction [42] . Apart from its homotypic interaction, the TSWV N protein is known to interact with viral glycoproteins and is proposed to be involved in viral particle assembly in the Golgi [33] . It also interacts with NSm and aids in the cell-to-cell movement of RNP complexes [39] . The three-dimensional structure of the N protein has not been described so far for any member of the genus Tospovirus.",

A search for RNA-binding motifs present in the N protein using the RNABindR software did not reveal canonical RNA-binding motifs with optimal and high specificity (data not shown). However, with high-sensitivity prediction by RNABindR (which predicts RNA binding based on positively charged amino acid residues), the segments 1-11, 36-40, 55-114, 186-192, 197-200 , 235-237, 245-276 were identified as possible regions of RNA binding (Fig. 1a , underlined regions). Foldindex analysis using the Foldindex \u00d3 program showed that the C-terminal region, comprising 37 amino acid residues, is unfolded (Fig. 1b) . It may be noted that this unfolded region overlaps with one of the predicted RNA-binding segments (amino acids 245-276). Many plant-and animal-virus-encoded proteins are phosphorylated, and such modifications have regulatory role in the viral life cycle [12, 21, 31] .

In order to investigate the oligomeric state of the N protein, size-exclusion chromatography was carried out on a Superdex S-200 column as described in ''Materials and methods''. The protein eluted in three peaks (Fig. 3d) . Peak 1 corresponded to the void fraction (greater than 600 kDa), peak 2 corresponded to 128 kDa (tetramer), and peak 3 corresponded to a 32-kDa (monomer) protein, as estimated using proteins of known molecular mass prior to loading the sample. There was an additional broad peak that eluted late in the run and had a high absorbance at 260 nm. However, when this fraction was analysed by western blot analysis, it did not show the presence of an N-proteinspecific band. These results suggest that the purified N protein existed as a heterogeneous mixture of monomers, tetramers and higher-order oligomers. Furthermore, the absorbance at 260 nm was higher than that at 280 nm, indicating that the N protein might be associated with nucleic acids. To confirm the presence of nucleic acid, the protein was further analysed on a 0.6% agarose gel. Agarose gel analysis showed two bands, one at the well and another that entered the gel (Fig. 4a) . Both of the bands showed ethidium bromide staining and Coomassie blue staining, confirming that N protein is associated with nucleic acids (Fig. 4a) . The bound nucleic acid was degraded specifically by RNase A treatment (Supplementary Fig. 1 ), suggesting that the N protein is present in a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Such an association of N protein with RNA has also been reported for Bunyamvera virus [27] and Rift Valley fever virus [32] . Several attempts were made to purify N protein devoid of nucleic acid by using various salts, detergents and nucleases in the buffers throughout the purification steps.

            "text": "The interaction of the N protein with the RNA would be essential for encapsidation of viral genomes, for replication, transcription and cell-to-cell movement. As no conserved RNA-binding motifs have been identified for tospoviruses, to map the domain of the N protein that specifically interacts with RNA, the presence of nucleic acid in the purified wild-type N protein and its truncated forms was initially monitored by spectrophotometric analysis of A 260 / 280 ratios. For wild-type N protein, the ratio ranged between 1.8 and 1.9, and for the ND20, ND40 and CD15 N proteins, it ranged between 1.2 and 1.7, suggesting the presence of nucleic acid. However, for CD37, it was 0.7 to 0.8, indicating that the protein was not associated with nucleic acid. Furthermore, the amount of RNA bound to the full-length N protein and its truncated forms was quantitated after extraction of the RNA with TRI Reagent (Table 2 ). Full-length N protein contained 19.5 \u00b1 0.5 lg of RNA in 100 lg of the protein, whereas the amount of RNA present was reduced by approximately 3-fold upon deletion of 20 amino acids from the N-terminus or 15 amino acids from the C-terminus. When 40 amino acid residues from the N terminus were removed, the amount of RNA associated with the protein was reduced by approximately 6-fold. As expected, no RNA c Western blot analysis of purified proteins using A10D10 monoclonal antibody to GBNV N protein [14] . Lanes are as marked in panel b was detected with the CD37 N protein. Thus, the capacity of the N protein to bind nucleic acid was completely lost upon removal of the unfolded region of the N protein comprising 37 residues from the C-terminus. This suggested that the C-terminal unfolded region (which also contains 46% of the residues predicted to interact with RNA) might play a major role in RNA binding. The location of an RNA-binding domain in the N proteins of negative-strand RNA viruses is variable. Xu et al. [44] mapped a specific RNA-binding domain to a central conserved region comprising residues 175 to 217 of the hantavirus N protein. Multiple regions of RNA binding have been observed for the TSWV N protein [34] and for the influenza virus N protein [7] . It may be noted that even in GBNV, apart from the C-terminal region, the deletion of the N-terminal 40 amino acid residues also affected the protein-nucleic acid interaction. It is possible that the loss of protein-nucleic acid interaction in this mutant is because of the altered structure of the mutant protein. Involvement of disordered regions in RNA binding has also been reported for the N protein of SARS corona virus, a positive-strand RNA virus [4] . Bioinformatic analysis shows that the C-terminal unfolded region is conserved across N proteins of serogroup IV tospoviruses and might be involved in genome encapsidation.",

            "text": "The phosphorylation reaction was inhibited to some extent by the addition of metal chelators such as EGTA (2 mM) and EDTA (2 mM) (Fig. 5a, lanes 5 and 6,  respectively) , suggesting a requirement for divalent metal ions for the reaction. Furthermore, when the reaction was carried out in the absence of MnCl 2 , the phosphorylation was abolished, confirming the requirement for metal ions (Fig. 5b, lane 1) . Therefore, the specificity of the metal ion required for the phosphorylation of the N protein was tested by the addition of increasing concentrations of MnCl 2 (Fig. 5b, lanes 2-4) , MgCl 2 (Fig. 5b, lanes 5-7) , and CaCl 2 (Fig. 5b, lanes 8-10) . As is apparent from the figure, the plant protein kinase that phosphorylates the N protein shows a preference for Mn 2? over Mg 2? , and no detectable band could be seen with Ca 2? . The Coomassie-stained gel confirmed that the effect observed was not due to variation in the amount of N protein used in the reaction. Similar observations have been made for a plant protein kinase that phosphorylates PVA coat protein and TMV movement protein [16] . Protein kinases that belong to the CK2 class have a unique ability to utilize both ATP and GTP as phosphoryl group donors [28] . The soluble fraction of N. benthamiana plant sap that was used for phosphorylation of the N protein was tested for its ability to utilize GTP instead of ATP. As shown in Fig. 5c , the protein kinase present in the fraction could utilize GTP as phoshphoryl group donor equally well (Fig. 5c, lane 4) , and even in this case, Mn 2? was the preferred metal ion (Fig. 5c , compare lane 4 with 5 and 6). Based on these data, we speculated that the protein kinase present in tobacco plant sap that phosphorylates the N protein could be a CK2-like kinase. Heparin, an inhibitor of CK2 [14] , reduced the phosphorylation of the N protein by 30% but failed to abolish phosphorylation of the protein completely ( Supplementary  Fig. 3) , suggesting that apart from CK2, there may be other kinases present in the tobacco plant sap that also phosphorylate the protein. To test whether the N protein acts as a substrate for more than one kinase, the phosphorylation reaction was carried out with purified recombinant kinases, viz., tobacco CK2 or chickpea CDPK. It was observed that the N protein could be phosphorylated by both of these kinases. As shown in Fig. 5d , the N protein could be phosphorylated by purified CK2 (Fig. 5d, lane 3) , whereas BSA used as negative control was not phosphorylated (Fig. 5d, lane 5) , and histone H1 (positive control) was (Fig. 5d, lane 6) . In addition to the phosphorylated histone H1 protein (35 kDa), two more bands were observed, suggesting the presence of contaminant proteins that are also phosphorylated. When a similar experiment was performed with purified CDPK, the N protein as well as the histone H1 protein were phosphorylated (Fig. 5e, lanes 3 and 5, respectively) and BSA used as a negative control was not phosphorylated (Fig. 5e, lane  6 ). It has been demonstrated that CDPKs are components of the defence pathways that are induced upon pathogen attack [22] . It is possible that phosphorylation of the N protein by CDPK is an early response to viral infection. Furthermore, the N protein can be phosphorylated by more than one kinase. Phosphorylation of a viral protein by multiple kinases is not uncommon. Surjit et al. [41] reported that the nucleocapsid protein of SARS corona virus acts as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase, glycogen synthase kinase, mitogen-activated kinase and casein kinase 2. Human influenza virus NS1 protein gets phosphorylated by members of the cyclin-dependent kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase families [13] . Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is a significant regulatory mechanism in a wide range of cellular processes (reviewed in ref. [6] ). In some viruses, like rubella virus and potato virus A, phosphorylation of the capsid or coat protein is known to regulate its RNA-binding activity and has an impact on virus replication and the infection process [16, 17, 21] . Phosphorylation of SARS coronavirus N protein modulates its multimerization, translation inhibitory activity and subcellular localization [31, 41] . In infectious bronchitis virus, phosphorylation of the N protein is involved in distinguishing viral RNA from non viral RNAs [40] . In yet another case, in measles virus, phosphorylation of the nucleoprotein is important for activation of transcription of viral mRNA and/or replication of the genome in vivo [12] . It is possible that phosphorylation of the GBNV N protein regulates its self-association and helps it to distinguish viral RNA from non-viral RNAs, which is an essential process in encapsidation. Phosphorylation may also regulate the subcellular localization of the protein and may act as a regulatory switch between the processes of transcription and translation.",

Such an association with RNA would be essential for encapsidation of viral genomes. Furthermore, the N protein interacts with the RNA via a conserved RNA-binding domain present in the C-terminal unfolded region of the protein. Such specific interactions and the regulation of the N protein by phosphorylation would be necessary for eliciting its multiple functions at different stages of the viral life cycle, such as replication, assembly and movement. Future studies in this direction could lead to a better understanding of the role of the N protein in the life cycle of GBNV at the molecular level.",
