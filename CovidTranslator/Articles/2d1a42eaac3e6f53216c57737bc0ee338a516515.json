            "text": "Cryptosporidium spp. infections in neonatal dairy calves can cause diarrhoea and, in rare cases, death. The infection is usually self-limiting, but halofuginone lactate (HL) can be used prophylactically. Calves (n = 144) in the study were born during a 2-month period on one farm. A total of 901 serum and 767 faecal samples were collected. Based on HL treatment, the calves were divided into 3 groups: I) not treated, II) treated incorrectly (treatment started > 48 h after birth, or lasted < 7 days), and III) treated correctly (started < 48 h after birth, and lasted \u22657 days). Over the 3-month observation period, 14.6% (n = 21) of the calves died, of which most (67%) had not been treated with HL. Correctly performed treatment of cryptosporidiosis significantly delayed the onset of oocysts shedding (P < 0.001) and reduced haptoglobin (HP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) concentrations in the second week of life. HP concentration and HL treatment were negatively associated with weight gain at 3 months of age. Cryptosporidium positive faecal samples were significantly (P < 0.001) more likely to be diarrhoeic but Giardia or Eimeria positive samples were not. Correct prophylactic treatment with HL delayed the shedding of Cryptosporidium oocysts and improved survival, but was negatively associated with weight gain. Incorrect treatment had a low impact on mortality and resembled no treatment regarding the proportion of calves shedding oocysts. Acute phase response (APR) in the second week of life seemed to be positively associated with shedding high amounts of Cryptosporidium oocysts.",

            "text": "Cryptosporidium can be found in cattle herds worldwide (O'Handley and Olson, 2006) and has also been found in Estonian dairy farms (Lassen et al., 2009) . Cryptosporidium infection in dairy calves can lead to villous atrophy in the small intestine mucosa and increase intestinal permeability (Wyatt et al., 2010) . Consequently, these pathologies can lead to diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality (Delafosse et al., 2015) . Neonatal calves have a higher risk of being negatively affected and shed Cryptosporidium oocysts more frequently than adult livestock (Maddox-Hyttel et al., 2006; Featherstone et al., 2010) . The incubation period of cryptosporidiosis varies on average from 5 to 7 days, but symptoms can start as early as 2 days post-infection (Abeywardena et al., 2015) . Infected calves typically excrete oocysts with faeces for about 2 weeks (Fayer et al., 1998; O'Handley et al., 1999) . Under experimental conditions, the Cryptosporidium oocysts count in faeces rises a day before the onset of diarrhoea, peaks, and drops 2 days before the diarrhoea becomes less severe (Operario et al., 2015) . In previous longitudinal studies, the highest number of Cryptosporidium oocysts were found during the second or third weeks of the calves' lives (Sant\u00edn et al., 2008; Coklin et al., 2010) .",

In a recent study, Giardia infection was also associated with haemorrhagic diarrhoea in calves (Lee et al., 2016) . In cases of experimental inoculation with the parasite, dairy calves usually survive the infection with only minor repercussions (Grit et al., 2014) . Calves who are infected after birth start shedding oocysts around the third week of life (O'Handley et al., 1999) . The Giardia infection rate is related to the age and has been found to peak 6 weeks after birth (Winkworth et al., 2008; Coklin et al., 2010) .",

In cases of viral (foot-and-mouth disease and bovine respiratory syncytial virus) or parasitic (Eimeria and Cryptosporidium) infections, APP concentrations can increase in domestic ruminants' blood serum (Orro et al., 2011; Pourjafar et al., 2011; Stenfeldt et al., 2011; Lassen et al., 2015) . In neonatal calves, APPs go through significant changes during first 2 to 3 weeks of life (Orro et al., 2008; T\u00f3thov\u00e1 et al., 2015) , suggesting that APPs have a role in the adaptation of neonate calves to the new environment. In reindeer calves, lambs, and beef calves, high concentrations of SAA measured in the second week of life have been associated with lower weight gain recorded many months later (Orro et al., 2006; Peetsalu et al., 2013; Sepp\u00e4-Lassila et al., 2015 , 2017 .",

In detail, sample preparation followed the same steps: weighing, mixing, diluting, and centrifuging, but after the supernatant was removed and before saturated sugar and solution (\u03c1 = 1.26 g/cm 3 ) was added, a 20 \u03bcl subsample of the 1 ml suspended pellet was fixed on glass slides well (14 mm diameter latex wells). Staining was done using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated anti-Cryptosporidium and anti-Giardia monoclonal antibodies (Crypto/Giardia Cel, Cellabs Pty Ltd., Sydney, Australia). The slides were examined using an epifluorescence Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope using 200-400\u00d7 magnification. Cryptosporidium and Giardia oocysts were differentiated visually based on morphology, and considered positive if at least 1 oocyst or cyst was found. All of the oocysts and cysts on the slide were counted and the approximate number of oocysts per gram of faeces (OPG) was calculated, corrected to the total area of the well and to the dilution of the sample (De Waele et al., 2010) . In case there were too many oocysts to count, 3 random visual fields on the slide were picked and all of the oocysts were counted in the field of view (Lassen and Lepik, 2014) . The counts of each visual field were averaged and multiplied with the fraction of the visual field surface area divided by the total slide surface area to calculate the total number of oocysts on a slide. DNA was extracted from 12 FITC Cryptosporidium-positive faecal samples collected at 3th March from calves borned between 21st January-20th February 2015 (mean age 21 days) using the PSP\u00ae Spin Stool DNA Kit (STRATEC Biomedical AG, Birkenfeld, Germany). The DNA was submitted to PCR amplification targeting the 18S rRNA gene of Cryptosporidum spp. as described by Zintl et al. (2007) , and the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene as described by Peng et al. (2001) . The PCR products were run on a 2% ethidium bromide stained agarose gel and visualized under an UV transilluminator. Products of approximately 825 bp from the 18S rRNA and approximately 490 bp of the gp60 amplifications were cleaned and submitted to sequencing in two directions using Applied Biosystems\u00ae 3130xl Genetic Analyzer. Forward and reverse sequences were aligned using the BioEdit v7.2.5 software (Hall, 1999) to generate consensus sequences and correct potential mismatches. The GenBank BLASTn (Altschul et al., 1990) tool was used to find similarities between the sequences of our PCR products and with deposited nucleotide sequences in the library. Sequences of the 18S rRNA products were used to determine the species of Cryptosporidium, and gp60 was used to determine the subtype.",

Before the start of the study, veterinarians on the farm had performed rapid pen-side tests with positive results for coronavirus, rotavirus, and Cryptosporidium. In addition, the herd had tested positive for bovine viral diarrhoea virus at the time of the study (personal communication from farm veterinarian). The significant increase in SAA and HP concentrations and presence of diarrhoea in calves has been observed in calves during rotavirus, coronavirus and E. coli infections (Balikci and Al, 2014) . In case of naturally occurring rotavirus or coronavirus coinfection with Cryptosporidium versus mono-infection, significantly higher SAA and HP concentration increase has been previously reported (Pourjafar et al., 2011) . Nevertheless, best to our knowledge there are no experimental studies where potential co-pathogenic synergism between rotavirus and Cryptosporidium infection has been demonstrated in calves. Our results indicated that Cryptosporidium infections effect to the production of APP was dose-dependent and associated clinical signs could be attributed to the Cryptosporidium infection (Fig. 4) . This study reflects the conditions of a farm, and though the outbreak fits the picture of cryptosporidiosis, it is not possible to exclude the co-existence of other pathogens. Fig. 1 . Cryptosporidium and Giardia infection patterns differentiated by halofuginone lactate (HL) treatments. Calves were assigned into groups retrospectively based on HL treatment regiments (separated by dashed lines on figure): 1 ) not treated (n = 34), 2 ) treated incorrectly (treatment started > 48 h after birth, or lasted < 7 days) (n = 45), and 3 ) treated according to manufacturer's instructions (started < 48 h after birth, and lasted \u2265 7 days) (n = 65). (\u25c6) Cryptosporidium positive; (\u25cb) Giardia positive; (\u00b7) Giardia and Cryptosporidium negative; (+) death (n = 17); horizontal lines represent HL treatment and the length represents the treatment in days.

            "text": "This study investigated the dynamics and treatment of what the farm veterinarians considered an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis. Only C. parvum isotype IIaA18G1R1 was found and which has been previously detected in calves faeces (Misic and Abe, 2007; Plutzer and Karanis, 2007; Brook et al., 2009) . We suspect that this subtype was the main cause of cryptosporidiosis in current study, but due to relatively small PCR sample size, which was collected in single time point during the study, it was difficult to say whether there were other subtypes present. Almost all of the calves (84%) were shedding Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts or Giardia spp. cysts in their faeces, but both parasites were found in only 6% of the faecal samples, and thus did not indicate an antagonistic effect. This may be explained by the differences in the parasites infection patterns (Xiao and Herd, 1994; Sant\u00edn et al., 2008 Sant\u00edn et al., , 2009 ). However, studies of morphological changes of the jejunum have suggested the possibility of an antagonistic effect of the two parasites (Ruest et al., 1997) . Most of Cryptosporidium infections happened before 1 month of age, similar to what has been reported previously in longitudinal studies (Harp and Goff, 1998; O'Handley et al., 1999; Geurden et al., 2007) . Calves that were shedding high amounts of Cryptosporidium oocysts had higher odds of being diarrhoeic than calves shedding Giardia or Eimeria, supporting Cryptosporidium as the causative agent of the symptoms. Some authors have suggested that Giardia infection itself does not cause diarrhoea (Maddox-Hyttel et al., 2006; O'Handley and Olson, 2006) . A previous study in dairy cattle on several Estonian farms found a negative correlation between diarrhoea and the presence of Eimeria spp. in faeces, but a positive correlation between diarrhoea and higher amounts of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts (Lassen et al., 2009) . In Finnish calves, the opposite was observed; Eimeria spp. was associated with diarrhoea, while Cryptosporidium and Giardia were not (Sepp\u00e4-Lassila et al., 2015) . This illustrates that intestinal parasites, including Cryptosporidium, are important agents of disease in calves in the area, but the general clinical picture varies.",

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) to decrease the number of Cryptosporidium oocysts shed in faeces, similar to what has been reported in one study (Weber et al., 2016) , but contrary to another (Keidel and Daugschies, 2013) . Nevertheless, the correctly performed prophylactic treatment had a delaying effect on the onset of shedding ( Fig. 2 and Table 2 ), seemed to improve survival (Fig. 1S) , but resulted in a poorer ADWG (Table 5) . Previous investigations have also reported that HL can cause a delay in oocyst shedding (Jarvie et al., 2005; Trotz-Williams et al., 2011; Keidel and Daugschies, 2013) , but not an impact on the survival of calves. Calves have higher risk of succumbing to dehydration and acidosis due to diarrhoea in their first week of life (Foster and Smith, 2009 ). Prophylactic HL treatment may delay the development of cryptosporidiosis and help calves cope with very strong infection pressure (Abeywardena et al., 2015) . It has been suggested that HL may have a positive therapeutic effect in calves aged 8-14 days (Klein, 2008) . Other authors (Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2009; Almawly et al., 2013) have reported that the therapeutic treatment effect of HL on calves' health seems to be limited, similar to the findings in this study.",

Cryptosporidium infections and the treatment may have reduced the severity of the illness and raised the chance of survival (Fig. 1S ). Higher GGT activity had a positive effect on survival, which suggests colostrum quality and adsorption of antibodies had an important role in the animal's ability to survive the infection. It has been shown that high levels of immunoglobulin G and long fatty acids in colostrum have some protective effect against diarrhoea caused by Cryptosporidium, but not against the infection itself (Lopez et al., 1988; Schmidt and Kuhlenschmidt, 2008; Weber et al., 2016) . This could mean that the animals who were at a weaker starting position due to poorer quality colostrum and lower birth weights more easily succumbed to Cryptosporidium infection. Only after starting the mass treatment with HL did the survival chances of these calves improve. Even incorrect treatment with HL seemed to have a positive effect on survival; thus, we could conclude that no treatment would be the worst option during a massive increase in cryptosporidiosis cases, especially when most of the deaths are diarrhoea-related.",

APR as an innate immune response is faster and more likely to play a role in controlling the infection and the development of disease in the early stages. Interestingly, higher SAA concentrations had a negative impact on the survival of calves. This suggests that APR was triggered more profoundly in severely affected animals (Fig. 3) . Although we cannot rule out other common digestive system pathogens, the evidence suggests that Cryptosporidium played a major role in diarrhoeic calves, and that the correct HL treatment was able to delay the APR induction and decrease its magnitude (Fig. 4) .",

HP, but not SAA, serum concentrations were significantly lower in the animal groups that were correctly treated compared to the untreated and incorrectly treated calves (Fig. 4) . This increase in concentrations of APP coincided with an increased proportion of the calves shedding Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts (Fig. 2) and mortality (Fig. 1S ) in the second week of life. The HP median concentration in heavily shedding animals was 4.8 times higher (950 mg/l) than the reference value (< 196 mg/l) of calves that age while the SAA median value (158 mg/l) did not exceed the reference value (< 178 mg/l) (Sepp\u00e4-Lassila et al., 2013). We speculate that this drastic difference was caused by the nature of the Cryptosporidium infection and likely because localised damage to the small intestine was more prone to trigger an immunological response that increased HP rather than SAA concentrations. Previously, relatively small studies (1 to 6 animals) reported an increase in HP and SAA in dairy calves as a response to Cryptosporidium infections, especially before the onset of diarrhoea (Enemark et al., 2003a,b; Pourjafar et al., 2011) . Although this study shed more light on the subject, there is a lack of research on the role of APR in Cryptosporidium and Giardia infections in cattle.",

In general, the calves' weight gain met the expectations of Holstein breed calves at 3 months of age (Retamal and Risco, 2011) , averaging around 121.3 kg. We expected that Cryptosporidium infection would have a lasting negative effect on the growth of the surviving calves. The effect of the infection should have been most obvious in calves that were infected but not treated. However, the largest effect was observed in animals that had the correct treatment. Other authors have not found a significant positive or negative effect of HL treatment on the growth rate (Jarvie et al., 2005; Trotz-Williams et al., 2011) . It is important to remember that HL treatment does not stop calves from being infected and shedding large numbers of Cryptosporidium oocysts, damaging the host's cells and consuming resources for replicating (Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2009 ). There were no significant changes in the feeding regimens in first 3 months of the calves' lives, ruling out differences in nutrition as an explanation. A possible explanation for the observed effect is the delay and possible expansion of the parasites' life cycle in the host due to the effect of HL. The categorisation of different HL treatment groups was very strongly influenced by birth order. As a result, we were not able to exclude time as a confounding factor in average daily weight regression models.",

In the current study, Cryptosporidium shedding was associated with higher serum concentrations of SAA and HP in the second week of the calves' life, indicating that this period of adaptation was critical.
