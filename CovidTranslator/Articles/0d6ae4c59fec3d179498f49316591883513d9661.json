The latter is characterized by arterial hypoxemia, noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema and an alteration of pulmonary surfactant which increases surface tension at the aireliquid interface. sPLA2-IIA, -V, -X can directly hydrolyse lung surfactant phospholipids [8] Human PLA2-IIA (hPLA2-IIA) has been long considered as the principal group associated to the development of ARDS [9] . However, it was recently demonstrated that only hPLA2-V and -X hydrolyse the pulmonary surfactant [10] and that contrary to hPLA2-IIA, these two PLA2 are expressed in normal human lung. It was concluded that hPLA2-V is the principal sPLA2 implicated in ARDS. Indeed, recent study showed that transgenic mice overexpressing mPLA2-V dies immediately after birth due to the alteration of the surfactant composition, which was not observed in mice overexpressing the mPLA2-X [11] .",

A comparison of the mammal's sPLA2 tissue distribution is also presented in order to propose functions for these newly identified proteins. We analyzed for the first time the expression pattern of these genes in the intestine, pancreas, heart, liver, colon, lung and spleen from both healthy chicken and chicken with inflammatory lung disease to establish possible gene coregulation and new biomarkers. Our data support the fact that several sPLA2 may contribute to the progression or modulation of infectious bronchitis in poultry.",

After amplification, melting curve analysis was performed as follows: 98 C for 10 s; annealing temperature for 20 s; continuous temperature gradient to 95 C with 5 acquisitions/s. The tissue cDNA samples (from animals and the indicated tissues and cells) were diluted 1/10 with nuclease free water, and the same cDNA dilution was used for all qPCR reactions. A fresh 10 \u00c01 e10 \u00c04 serial dilution was prepared from each target gene to be analyzed starting from the 1/10 dilution of a purified PCR product, and every gene was measured twice independently with duplicate samples. From the serial dilution, 10 \u00c01 e10 \u00c04 dilutions were used as an internal standard. As housekeeping genes, we measured the mRNA expression levels of chicken b-actin. The qPCR primers used are shown in Table 3 . In qPCR, every gene had PCR efficiencies ranging from 1.902 to 1.972, as calculated from the internal standard; thus, no efficiency correlation was performed. The Light Cycler 480 Software (release 1.1.0.0520) with absolute quantification was used to calculate the concentrations and standard deviations of the samples. The concentration of the target gene was divided by the concentration of the housekeeping gene thus showing the relative expression of the mRNA in the tissue. This calculation was performed for all tissues analyzed. Standard deviations were calculated by multiplying the obtained relative value with the standard deviation of the target. The resulting relative and standard deviation values were scaled to a range of 0e10 including the standard deviations.",

The data concerning the newly identified chicken cDNAs and proteins are summarized in Table 1 , together with the available informations on human and mouse orthologs. When full-length clones could be obtained, the sizes of the predicted proteins were found to be similar to those of human sPLA2s, lending support to the assigned designations of the galline phospholipases A2. Amino acid sequence alignment of the five chicken sPLA2 that have been cloned in this work and the corresponding human sPLA2 is presented in Fig. 2 , and the degrees of sequence identity are shown in Table 1 . Based on their structural features, chicken group IIA and group IIE sPLA2 are clearly members of the group II collection of sPLA2 [1,4e6,20e22] . Indeed, both sPLA2 display the specific features of group II sPLA2, including a cystein residue at position 50 and a cystein residue that terminates the group II-specific C-terminal extension of 7 residues (Fig. 2) . A BLAST search for homology with the ChPLA2-X protein sequence revealed that this protein has the highest identity level (45%) with hPLA2-X [21] . In contrast, the identity level of ChPLA2-X to other Gallus gallus sPLA2 is lower than 38%. In addition, ChPLA2-X shares with hPLA2-X the same structural features [23] . It is predicted that ChPLA2-X consists of 31-amino acid prepropeptide sequence ending with a basic dipeptide (ReR) and a mature protein of 124 residues compared with the human (same dipeptide ReR) and the mouse PLA2-X which is made of a 28-amino acid prepropeptide sequence ending with a basic dipeptide (KeR) and a mature protein of 123 residues. Like hPLA2-X and mPLA2-X, ChPLA2-X has 8 conserved disulfides bridges but it has a group II like C-terminal extension of 9 residues instead of 8 (Fig. 2) .",

Using qPCR, similar results were observed in mammals with a highest mRNA expression level in colon [31] . It is worth noticing that ChPLA2-X was neither detected in the pancreas nor in the liver. A fairly expression of mPLA2-X was also observed in stomach, indicating that mPLA2-X expression is not exclusive to testis but present in a few number of tissues. Surprisingly, the tissue distribution pattern of hPLA2-X appears very different from that of mPLA2-X and it is expressed in spleen, thymus, blood leucocytes, lung, colon, and pancreas [21] . Using in situ studies, hybridization of human lung biopsies showed that only hPLA2-V and -X were expressed in airway epithelium [42] . More recently, it has been shown that the levels of sPLA2-IIA was shown to be present at high levels in lungs of ARDS patients [43] .",

It is responsible of acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) in chickens at all ages and then a loss of production. Upon infection, the virus is present in the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen and kidney and it induces serious lung injury [16] . The CoV infecting humans is responsible for severe respiratory acute syndrome [17] characterized by hypoxemia and non cardiogenic pulmonary oedema [8] . The comparative gene expression of sPLA2 in healthy chickens and chickens with infectious bronchitis was performed here for the first time. A marked decrease by 30-, 12-and 2-fold in the respective expression levels of ChPLA2-IB, ChPLA2-IIA and ChPLA2-X was observed in infected chicken lung. Indeed, ChPLA2-IIA was found to be present in several tissues at high and moderate level of normal intestine, heart liver and lung, and its expression was markedly reduced in avian infectious bronchitis (Fig. 3) . These findings suggest a down regulation of sPLA2 gene expression as an immunity response, to limit for instance the hydrolysis of lung surfactant by these enzymes. In a previous work, Vial et al. [44] reported that the expression of sPLA2-IIA in alveolar macrophages is down-regulated by an inflammatory stimulus suggesting a possible negative control of sPLA2-IIA during alveolar macrophages activation. In several other studies, Touqui et al. have suggested a mechanism of down regulation of sPLA2-IIA by the lung surfactant and intracellular AMPc in alveolar macrophages [45] .",

This observation could be related to an anatomical particularity in chickens, in which there is no sharp boundary between digestive and respiratory system due to the absence of diaphragm as the case in mammals [46] . It is worth noticing that hPLA2-IB has been detected in serum of patients with ARDS but not in healthy controls [47] and it can be used as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for future development of ARDS [48] . The enzyme has also been implicated in complications of severe acute pancreatitis [47, 49] , a recognized risk factor in ARDS. ChPLA2-X, totally absent in healthy chicken pancreas, was found to be highly expressed in infected chicken pancreas (104.78). The sPLA2-X could therefore be considered as a good marker in pulmonary disease. Since pancreatic enzymes such as sPLA2-IB can be found in the blood of patients, it would be interesting to investigate the presence of sPLA2-X in the blood of infected chicken using specific antibodies.",
