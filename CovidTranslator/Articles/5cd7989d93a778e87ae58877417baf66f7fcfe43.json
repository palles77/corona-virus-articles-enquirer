Wang [5] performed a study and found that administration of large doses of hormone in short time could make blood be in hypercoagulable state. Liu [6] thought that, during the episode of ANFH, abnormal blood coagulation was present. Zheng [7] found that hormone could result in high coagulation and early activation of platelet. But up to date, there was no report that discussed platelet membrane glycoprotein and tetrachoric coagulation. It was found that, in these patients with ANFH after SARS, the expression of glycoprotein CD31, CD61, CD62P, CD63 and PAC-1 on platelet membrane decreased; coagulation four indices including PT, APTT and TT time were all normal. The content of Fbg was also normal. It indicated that there was no high blood coagulation when our patients were found to be ANFH, which was consistent with the results acquired by Wang [8] . They conducted a study on blood coagulation function of SARS patients and found that PT, APTT prolonged remarkablely and Fbg had a significant rise during the acute stage of episode, but became normal three months after the disease was cured.",

In our study, the expression of glycoprotein on platelet membrane decreased, which suggested that platelet did not be activated. The reasons might be as follows. (1) The expression of glycoprotein on platelet membrane was impaired because its structure was destroyed by SARS virus. (2) Large doses of hormone were administrated. DU [9] reported that the levels of glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa, GMP-140 on platelet membrane in asthmatic patients at remission stage were higher than those in normal patients.

Autoantibody was produced after patients were infected by virus. Epitope family were mostly located in glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa on platelet membrane, in the meantime, glycoprotein on platelet membrane was impacted by enclosure of antibody and lost the function of adhesion and aggregation. (4) Large quantities of antibiotics were applied. Coagulation four indices could reflect the blood coagulation function of human body, among which PT mostly reflected the content and activity of coagulation factors in the route of extrinsic coagulation; APTT mostly reflected the content and activity of coagulation factors in the route of intrinsic coagulation; TT reflected whether blood antithrombotics increased. Fbg was not only a principal coagulation factor in the blood coagulation system, but also an accessory factor for platelet aggregation. Only if platelet was activated, its spatial configuration changed, and fibrinogen receptor was exposed, identification and incorporation between fibrinogen and platelet could be facilitated and thus platelet aggregated. That coagulation four indices were normal indicated that the contents of internal and extrinsic coagulation factors in ANFH patients after SARS were normal, and that their blood was not hypercoagulative, at the meantime indirectly proved that platelet did not be activated, and blood coagulation system did not be initiated, which was in accordance with decreasing expression of glycoprotein on platelet membrane. Based on the comprehensive analysis, it was found that their blood was not hypercoagulative when patients suffered from ANFH after SARS. The possible reasons include: (1) hormone was administered at large doses in a short time;",

Consequently, it is inferred that ANFH after SARS may not develop in the mechanism of abnormality of blood coagulation. However, only several markers related to blood coagulation were measured. It is possible that there are other special blood coagulation substances in the blood of patients with ANFH after SARS, which needs to be studied further.",
