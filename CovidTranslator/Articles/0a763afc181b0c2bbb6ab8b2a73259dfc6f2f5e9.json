Rather, it has been the development of vaccines that has been the mainstay of prevention and intervention strategies for combating human and animal viral diseases. There are presently 15 viral vaccines approved for human use, excluding various subtypes, and the majority of these are live-attenuated formulations (reviewed in (1)). In general terms, these liveattenuated viral vaccines are highly effective because they elicit a balanced immune response in the recipient host; stimulating both cell-mediated and humoral immunity. However, for many viruses especially those that have associated highly pathogenic characteristics as with Biological Safety Level-4 (BSL-4) restricted agents or retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the use of live attenuated vaccines are not feasible.",

            "text": "A number of studies have demonstrated the importance of neutralizing antibodies in the protection or recovery from viral infections (2, 3) . Indeed, as obligate intracellular parasites, viruses pose significant challenges for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics. Neutralizing polyclonal antibodies have a long history of being effective against some viruses and more recently, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have also shown success. The humanized mAb Synagis (palivizumab), which is currently the only mAb against a viral disease approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has been widely used as a prophylactic measure against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in neonates and immune-compromised individuals and is more cost-effective and efficacious than the original polyclonal product (4) . Most recently, the anti-RSV palivizumab has been improved, and motavizumab has been shown to potently inhibit viral replication in the upper respiratory tract in a cotton rat model (5) . Virus-neutralizing antibodies can also be administered passively to acutely infected individuals and be highly efficacious. The mechanism of passively administered antibody therapy can be viewed as that of an antiviral drug; suppressing infection and permitting the host to mount an effective immune response (6) . Today, passively administered antibody is routinely used as an effective antiviral therapy or prophylactic for hepatitis B, varicella-zoster, rabies virus, measles virus, and others (reviewed in (2)). In most cases their use is a first-line therapy as a post-exposure measure or in circumstances where vaccination is not possible. However, serum polyclonal antibody preparations have associated problems related to toxicity and potential allergic reactions, as well as lot to lot variation and uncertain dosing regimes (7) .",

            "text": "The major advances in furthering the development of specific mAbs, has been through the use of bacterial phage display platforms with combinatorial antibody libraries (8, 9) . Further, these phage libraries can be prepared to encode human antibodies as Fabs which contain the light chain and the first two domains of the heavy chain or single-chain variable domain fragments (scFvs) containing the variable domains of the light and heavy chains, and this technology has been complemented by innovative affinity maturation strategies to improve antibody binding (reviewed in (10) ). These techniques in human phage-display antibody platforms have facilitated the rapid identification and isolation of specific human mAbs, eliminating the immunization, hybridoma development, and humanization processes. In the absence of available vaccines or antiviral drugs, the identification and characterization of new human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) able to neutralize viruses offers the possibility for effective pre-and post-exposure therapeutic modalities.

All known viral envelope glycoproteins are homo-or heterooligomers in their mature and functional forms (20) and multimeric proteins, like these, generally interact over large areas which often translate into important structural differences between monomeric subunits and the mature oligomer. This feature can also impart significant differences in antigenic structure which has been shown for a number of proteins such as the trimeric influenza HA glycoprotein (21) and HIV-1 gp120/gp41 (22) . In addition, some viruses pose significant additional challenges such as antigenic variation of their structural proteins that are important neutralization determinants. Perhaps the best characterized example of this particular problem is with primary HIV-1 isolates that exist across the many varied HIV-1 subtypes (23) . In efforts to circumvent this issue, further improvements and enhancements in the techniques of phage-displayed antibody library panning have been developed in order to better select for broadly reactive mAbs or for mAbs reactive to particular subunits of a multi-subunit viral glycoprotein such as sequential antigen panning (SAP) and competitive (CAP) antigen panning methodologies (14, 15) .",
