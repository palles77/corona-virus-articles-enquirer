We study 17 how observed intervals differ from \"intrinsic\" intervals that could be estimated by tracing 18 individual-level infectiousness, and identify both spatial and temporal effects, including cen-19 soring (due to observation time), and the effects of susceptible depletion at various spatial 20 scales. Early in an epidemic, we expect the variation in the observed generation intervals to 21 be mainly driven by the censoring and the population structure near the source of disease 22 spread; therefore, we predict that correcting observed intervals for the effect of temporal 23 censoring but not for spatial effects will provide a spatially informed \"effective\" generation-24 interval distribution, which will correctly link r and R. We develop and test statistical 25 methods for temporal corrections of generation intervals, and confirm our prediction using 26 individual-based simulations on an empirical network.",

However, estimating the reproductive number directly from 35 disease natural history requires detailed knowledge which is not often available, particularly 36 early in an outbreak (3). Instead, the reproductive number can be indirectly estimated from 37 the exponential growth rate, which can be estimated from incidence data (4; 5; 6; 7; 8).",

There are important distinctions to be made when estimating 43 generation intervals: intrinsic generation intervals measure the infectiousness of an infected 44 individual, while observed generation intervals refer to the time between actual infection 45 events. 46 While the intrinsic generation-interval distribution is often assumed to be fixed, the 47 shape of the observed generation-interval distribution depends on when and how intervals 48 are measured (14; 15; 17; 16; 18). When an epidemic is growing exponentially, as often occurs 49 near the beginning of an outbreak, the number of newly infected individuals will be large 50 relative to the number infected earlier on.

This perspective allows us to reinterpret the finding of (19) that, given an 67 intrinsic generation interval and an observed growth rate, the reproductive number on various 68 network structures is always smaller on a network than would be predicted from homogeneous 69 mixing.

We therefore expect that starting from observed generation 220 intervals and correcting for the right-censoring effect, will allow us to estimate an \"effective\" 221 generation interval that accurately reflects dynamics of spread. When temporal correction 222 is performed early in an outbreak, during the exponential growth phase, the effective distri-223 bution should incorporate egocentric and local spatial effects but not the global effects; we 224 expect this distribution to correctly link r and R. We will call the temporally corrected ef-225 fective generation-interval distribution g eff (\u03c4 ). In a large homogeneously mixing population, Here, we investigate two methods for correcting for temporal bias in contact-tracing data 230 (see Methods for details). We refer to the first method as the population-level method as Using the observed generation-interval distributions (based on the first 1000 generation intervals) without correcting for right-censoring severely underestimates the reproductive number. Similarly, using the intrinsic generation-interval distribution overestimates the reproductive number because it fails to account for local spatial effects; the egocentric distribution corrects for this only partially. Both population-level and individual-level methods provide estimates of reproductive number that are consistent with the empirical estimates, which we define as the average number of secondary cases generated by the first 100 infected individuals, but the individual-level method is more precise. Boxplots are generated using 100 stochastic simulations of the SEIR model on an empirical network using Ebola-like parameters (20): mean latent period 1/\u03c3 = 5 days and mean infectious period 1/\u03b3 = 11.4 days. Per-pair contact rate \u03bb = 0.08 days \u22121 is chosen to be sufficiently high such that differences are clear.",

We compare two methods for estimating the effective generation-interval distribution and 298 assume that the effective generation-interval distribution follows a gamma distribution. The 299 gamma approximation of the generation interval distribution has been widely used due to its 300 simplicity (31; 6; 32; 33; 34); we previously thought that summarizing the entire distribution 301 with two moments (mean and variance) is sufficient to understand the role of generation-302 interval distributions in linking r and R (13). However, further investigation of our methods 303 suggests that making a wrong distributional assumption can lead to biased estimates of 304 the mean and CV of a generation-interval distribution (Appendix A.3), even though the 305 gamma distribution \"looks\" indistinguishable from the shape of the intrinsic generation-306 interval distribution (derived from the SEIR model). These results are particularly alarming population structure can lead to subexponential growth (35; 36; 37; 38; 39; 40); we therefore expect our simulations on an empirical network to be better characterized by subexponential 314 growth models (40).

For both 241 methods, mean and coefficient of variation (CV) of generation-interval distributions are es-242 timated by maximum likelihood; the inferred generation-interval distribution is then used to 243 estimate the reproductive number R from the observed growth rate r using the Euler-Lotka 244 equation. 245 To test these methods, we simulate 100 epidemics with Ebola-like parameters on an 246 empirical network (30) and compare the estimates of reproductive number with empirical 247 reproductive numbers, which we define as the average number of secondary cases generated 248 by the first 100 infected individuals (Fig. 4). As expected, calculating reproductive number 249 based on the intrinsic generation-interval distribution overestimates the empirical reproduc-250 tive number; estimates based on the egocentric generation-interval distribution (10) address 251 this problem only partially, as they do not account for indirect (local) spatial effects. Direct 252 estimates based on the observed generation intervals from contact tracing severely under-253 estimate the empirical estimates. While both population-and individual-level corrections 254 provide similar estimates to the empirical reproductive number on average, population-level 255 estimates are more variable as they are more sensitive to outliers in generation intervals and 256 our estimate of the growth rate. For smaller values of R, we expect the differences to become 257 smaller.

Overall, our qualitative conclusions do not change. generation-interval distribution, which describes the expected time distribution 262 of secondary cases, provides a direct link between speed (exponential growth rate, r) and 263 strength (reproductive number, R) of an epidemic (12; 10; 21; 13). However, observed 264 generation-interval distributions can vary depending on how and when they are measured (15; 265 17; 16; 18); determining which distribution correctly links r and R can be challenging.

Our study illustrates that generation intervals measured through 321 contact-tracing data contain information about the underlying contact structure, which can 322 be implicitly reflected in the estimates of the reproductive number; this perspective can be 323 particularly useful for characterizing an epidemic because detailed information about the 324 contact structure is often unavailable. 325 The generation-interval distribution is a key, and often under-appreciated, component 326 of disease modeling and forecasting. Different definitions, and different measurement ap-327 proaches, produce different estimates of these distributions. We have shown that estimates 328 based on observed generation intervals (e.g., through contact tracing) differ in predictable 329 ways from estimates based on underlying measures of infectiousness (e.g., from shedding 330 studies). These predictable differences can arise from temporal effects, egocentric spatial 331 effects, local spatial (or network) effects and population-level effects. We have shown that 332 correcting observed intervals for temporal effects allows us to estimate a spatially informed 333 \"effective\" distribution, which accurately describes how disease spreads in a population. 334 Future studies should carefully consider how measurement influences estimated generation-335 interval distributions, and how these distributions influence the spread of disease. the effects on right-censoring on the observed generation intervals, we use the de-339 terministic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model. The SEIR model de-340 scribes how disease spreads in a homogeneously mixing population; it assumes that infeceted 341 individuals become infectious after a latent period. We use a SE m I n R model, which extends 342 the SEIR model to have multiple equivalent stages in the latent and infectious periods. This 343gives latent and infectious periods with Erlang distributions (gamma distributions with in-344 teger shape parameters), which are often more realistic than the exponentially",

Parameters of the model are specified as 349 follows: N is the total population size, \u03b2 is the transmission rate, 1/\u03c3 is the mean latent 350 period, n E is the number of latent compartments, 1/\u03b3 is the mean infectious period, and 351 n I is the number of infectious compartments. We show results based on more realistic an individual-based SEIR model on a contact network, using an algorithm 355 based on the \"Gillespie algorithm\" (50; 51). We begin by randomly selecting individuals 356 assumed to be infected at t = 0. For each infected individual i, we randomly draw the latent 357 period E i from an Erlang distribution with mean 1/\u03c3 and shape n E . We then construct358 the random infectious period and infectious contact times simultaneously as follows. For 359 each of the n I stages of the infectious period, we draw the number of effective contacts (be-360 fore transitioning to the next compartment) from a geometric distribution with probability 361 n I \u03b3/(S i \u03bb + n I \u03b3), where S i is the number of susceptible acquaintances and \u03bb is the per-pair 362 contact rate. We then choose the time between consecutive events (the chosen number of 363 contacts, followed by exit from the given stage of infection) from an exponential distribution 364 with rate S i \u03bb + n I \u03b3. For each contact, a contactee is uniformly sampled from the set of 365 susceptible acquaintances of the individual i. The infectious period I i is the sum of all of 366 these waiting times. 367 After repeating the contact process for all initially infected individuals, all contacts are 368 put into a sorted queue. The first person in the queue becomes infected, and the current 369 time is updated to infection time of this individual. Any subsequent contacts made to this 370 individual are removed from the queue because they will no longer be effective. We repeat 371 the contact process for this newly infected individual. Then, new contacts are added to 372 the sorted queue. The simulation continues until there are no more contacts are left in the",
