Amastatin and probestin were effective against all three aminopeptidases, with the eon~entration of inhibitor required to cause 50% inhibition (iso) in the low micromolar range (I~~ = 1.5-20 @M), except for probestin with AP-N which displayed an I 5o of 50 nM. Actinonin failed to inhibit significantly either AP-A or AP-W, and thus can be considered a relatively selective inhibitor (I~\" = 2.0 PM) of AP-N. In contrast, bestatin was a relatively poor inhibitor of AP-N (I~\" = 89 PM) and failed to inhibit AP-A, but was more potent towards AP-W (1~0 = 7.9 PM). Thus, some of the observed chemotherapeutic actions of bestatin may be due to inhibition of cell-surface AP-W. A number of other metallopeptidase inhibitors, including inhibitors of endopeptidase-24.11 {EC 3.4.24.11) and membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.11), and the carboxyiaIky1 and phospho~l inhibitors of an~otensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) failed to inhibit significantly AP-A, AP-N or AP-W. However, AP-W was inhibited with lzo values in the micromolar range by the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors rentiapril (I~,, = 1.6 PM),",

Some of them are proving to be therapeutic targets in a variety of disease states, including heart disease, inflammation and metastasis [2, 3] . Several cell surface peptidases have recently been identified as cluster differentiation (CD?) antigens. For example, endopeptidase-24.11 (EC 3.4.24.11) has been shown to be identical to the common acute lymphocytic leukaemia antigen (CALLA; CDlO) [4] , aminopeptidase N (AP-N; EC 3.4.11.2) to CD13 [S] . dipeptidyl peptidase IV (EC 3.4.14.5) to CD26 [6] and aminopeptidase A (AP-A; EC 3.4.11.7) to the murine P-lymphocyte differentiation antigen BP1/6C3 [7] . The role(s) of these peptidases in metastasis is unclear, although the termination or generation of peptide signals affecting the proliferation of transformed and normal cells is a possibility. In addition, AP-N has been identified recently as a receptor in both pigs and humans for the coronaviruses TGEV and 229E, respectively [S, 91.",

To date four distinct enzymes have been characterized: AP-N, AP-A, aminopeptidase P (AP-P; EC 3.4.11.9) and aminopeptidase W (AP-W; EC 3.4.11.16). AP-P is somewhat different from the other three in being anchored in the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinosito1 moiety [lo] and in having a strict requirement for Pro in the penultimate position of susceptible substrates [ 111. AP-N, the best characterized of this class, displays a broad substrate specificity 1121 and has been identified as the major activity releasing the Nterminal Tyr from the enkephalins [ 131. The enzyme may also play a role in the metabolism of cholecystokinin-8 [14] and neurokinin A 1151. AP-A hydrolyses acidic residues from the N-terminus of susceptible substrates and may be involved in the in uivo conversion of angiotensin I1 to angiotensin III [16] . AP-W preferentially hydrolyses short peptides and exhibits maximal rates towards di~ptides in which the Pi residue is aromatic [17, IS]. So far, AP-W has not been implicated in the metabolism of any biologically active peptide, due in part to the lack of a selective inhibitor. The specificities of these latter three aminopeptidases overlap to a certain extent often leading to difficulties in identifying unequivocally the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of a particular peptide.",

            "text": "Due to the key role played by angiotensin converting enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system. numerous inhibitors of this zinc peptidyl dipeptidase have been synthesized and some have been used successfully in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure [38,39]. These compounds can be divided into three classes depending on the group that coordinates to the active site zinc atom: (i) sulphydryl, (ii) carboxylalkyl and (iii) phosphoryl. Recently, we observed that AP-P was sensitive to inhibition by some of these converting enzyme inhibitors [19] . In the present study we have extended these observations by assessing the effect of inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme on AP-A, -N and -W. None of the compounds examined caused significant inhibition of AP-A or AP-N. However, the sulphydryl compounds rentiapril, zofenoprilat and YS 980 all inhibited AP-W with I~,, values in the micromolar range (1.6-17.7 PM). These sulphydryl compounds are all analogues of captopril [38] . YS 980 is structurally identical to captopril apart from having a sulphur atom at position 4 of the prolyl ring. Zofenoprilat differs from captopril in possessing an aromatic ring attached to position 4 of the prolyl ring by a sulphur bridge. while rentiapril differs from YS 980 in having a hydroxylated aromatic ring attached to position 5 of the prolyl ring. The increased potencies towards AP-W of rentiapril and zofenoprilat may be due to their large aromatic moieties mimicking the aromatic Pi residue of the substrate. The order of potency of these sulphydryl compounds is essentially the reverse of that seen with AP-P [19] where the order was YS 980 (15s = 19.5 PM), captopril (I~,, = 110 ,uM), zofenoprilat (USA = 44OyM) and rentiapril caused only 35% inhibition at a concentration of 1 mM. The slight inhibition of AP-W observed with thiorphan (Table  1 ) is probably also due to the zinc coordinating sulphydryl group in this compound.",

            "text": "Even though the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors are loo-fold less potent at inhibiting AP-W than angiotensin converting enzyme [19] , an in vitro 150 value in the micromolar range may be significant in causing inhibition of AP-W in vivo. For example, teprotide, the first effective converting enzyme inhibitor in vivo, displays an rso toward the enzyme of 1.0 PM [40] . In addition, the inhibitor of membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.11), cilastatin, which is coadministered with the @actam antibiotic imipenem to prevent its metabolism by dipeptidase in the kidney, displays an 150 value of 0.1 FM in vitro [41] . In clinical use, numerous side effects have been noted with captopril, including coughing, skin rashes and taste disturbance [39, 42] . The cause of these adverse effects remains unclear, ahhough similar side effects have been noted with penicillamine leading to speculation that the sulphydryl group may be responsible. The results of the present study suggest that these effects may be due to additional inhibition of AP-W by the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors.",

We also confirm that actinonin is a relatively selective inhibitor of AP-N, but that bestatin is a relatively poor inhibitor of this peptidase and is much more potent towards AP-W. This raises the question as to whether the chemotherapeutic properties of bestatin may involve inhibition of AP-W. The observation that the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors, rentiapril and zofenoprilat, are relatively potent and totally specific for AP-W over any of the other cell surface zinc aminopeptidases should enable the role of this enzyme in the metabolism of bioactive peptides under normal and disease situations to be assessed, and may explain some of the side effects noted with the clinical use of these compounds. However, no selective inhibitor of AP-A has been identified. ",
