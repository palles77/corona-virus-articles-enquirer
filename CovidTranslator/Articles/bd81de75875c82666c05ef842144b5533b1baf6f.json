Despite impressive vaccine successes, however, many infectious diseases cannot yet be efficiently controlled or eradicated through vaccination, often because it is impossible to vaccinate a sufficient proportion of the population. Recent advances in molecular biology suggest that the centuries-old method of individual-based vaccine delivery may be on the cusp of a major revolution. Specifically, genetic engineering brings to life the possibility of a live, transmissible vaccine. Unfortunately, releasing a highly transmissible vaccine poses substantial evolutionary risks, including reversion to high virulence as has been documented for the oral polio vaccine. An alternative, and far safer approach, is to rely on genetically engineered and weakly transmissible vaccines that have reduced scope for evolutionary reversion. Here, we use mathematical models to evaluate the potential efficacy of such weakly transmissible vaccines. Our results demonstrate that vaccines with even a modest ability to transmit can significantly lower the incidence of infectious disease and facilitate eradication efforts. Consequently, weakly transmissible vaccines could provide an important tool for controlling infectious disease in wild and domestic animal populations and for reducing the risks of emerging infectious disease in humans.",

Specifically, genetic engineering brings to life the possibility of a transmissible or 'self-disseminating' vaccine [6, 7] . Rather than directly vaccinating every individual within a population, a transmissible vaccine would allow large swaths of the population to be vaccinated effortlessly by releasing an infectious agent genetically engineered to be benign yet infectious. This concept may sound like science fiction, but the oral polio vaccine already does this to a limited extent [8] , and transmissible vaccines have now been developed and deployed in wild animal populations [6] . For instance, recombinant transmissible vaccines have been developed to protect wild rabbit populations against myxomatosis [9] and to interrupt the transmission of Sin Nombre hantavirus in reservoir populations of deer mice [10, 11] . In addition, a transmissible vaccine is currently being developed to control Ebola within wildlife reservoirs [12] . Given the current pace of technological advance in genetic engineering, it is only a matter of time before transmissible vaccines can be easily developed for a wide range of infectious diseases.",

The most obvious and significant risk posed by a live transmissible vaccine is the potential for increased virulence to evolve. For instance, if a transmissible vaccine is developed through attenuation involving only a few genetic substitutions, reversions to wild-type virulence may evolve rapidly, as has occurred repeatedly with the oral polio vaccine [8, 13] . The risk of reversion to high virulence can be minimized by genetically engineering transmissible vaccines using techniques that impede evolution, such as inflicting a large number of mildly deleterious mutations, rearranging the genome or imposing deletions [7] . Still, even the best engineered transmissible vaccine may ultimately evolve elevated virulence if sufficiently long chains of transmission are allowed to occur. Thus, the safest implementation would also engineer the vaccine so that it can transmit only weakly (R 0 , 1), such that chains of transmission are short and stutter to extinction without continuous reintroduction. Transmissible vaccines designed in this way would be much less likely to evolve increased virulence or self-sustaining epidemics [14] . What remains unknown, however, is whether these safe but only weakly transmissible vaccines would significantly enhance our ability to control and eradicate infectious disease.",

Although our results apply to vaccines with arbitrary transmission rates, we will focus primarily on weakly transmissible vaccines (R 0 , 1) because these represent the safest implementation. Our model is a straightforward extension of existing models of direct vaccination, differing only by including the potential for vaccine transmission among hosts. We use our model to answer two specific questions. First, how much does vaccine transmission facilitate disease eradication? Second, when eradication is impossible, how much does vaccine transmission reduce the incidence of infectious disease within the host population? Answering these questions provides an important first step in quantifying the potential gains that could accrue through the use of a transmissible vaccine.",

Individuals infected with the live vaccine transmit the vaccine to susceptible individuals at rate, b V , and recover and become immune at rate, d V .

For the particular class of weakly transmissible vaccines we focus on here (i.e. R 0,V , 1), this result suggests a transmissible vaccine will have its most appreciable (more than 10%) Even in cases where a transmissible vaccine does not allow an infectious disease to be eradicated, it may still reduce disease incidence substantially.

Simulations were run for three different vaccine transmission rates and initiated with the susceptible population at its disease and vaccine free equilibrium (1000 individuals) and an initial seed of 50 individuals infected with the wild-type disease; resistant hosts and vaccine infected hosts were initially absent. For each transmission rate, 1000 simulations were run for a 100-year burn-in period followed by introduction of a vaccination programme. Simulations were then run for an additional time period and the proportion of simulations in which the disease was eradicated recorded. Additional simulations evaluated the probability of disease extinction as a function of vaccine R 0 , by conducting 1000 replicate simulations for values of vaccine R 0 ranging from 0 to 1. These values of vaccine R 0 bracketed the critical value for disease eradication predicted by equation (A 5), and show that reductions in disease incidence caused by the transmissible vaccine result in a high probability of disease eradication even before the critical threshold of vaccine transmission is reached ( figure 4) . The reason disease eradication occurs prior to reaching the eradication threshold is that vaccine transmission reduces the number of individuals infected with the disease sufficiently for stochastic extinction to become likely.",

There are two important consequences of this result. First, if it is impossible to directly vaccinate a sufficient fraction of a population for disease eradication, whether due to limitations of public health infrastructure or prohibitive cost, vaccine transmission can tip the balance in favour of eradication. Second, even modest amounts of vaccine transmission can substantially reduce the effort and cost required to achieve a target level of vaccination within a population. These results are important because they demonstrate that it may be feasible to engineer transmissible vaccines that are effective while maintaining the greater margin of safety that comes from being only weakly transmissible (R 0 , 1).",

This is particularly true for live, attenuated vaccines developed using traditional methods that adapted a virus to unnatural conditions in the hope that growth in the focal host would decline and pathogenesis would wane. Because these old methods were haphazard, vaccines developed in this way may require only a few genetic changes to revert to wild-type virulence, as has been observed for the oral polio vaccine [13] . Fortunately, recent developments in genetic engineering provide considerable improvements in attenuation methods and the promise of reduced scope for reversion. One especially promising method is attenuation by introducing many silent codon changes [7, 23, 24] . For reasons still not fully understood, some types of silent codon changes reduce fitness slightly, and when dozens to hundreds of such changes are combined in the same genome, fitness can be reduced to arbitrary levels. Deletions and genome rearrangements have similar attenuating effects and also appear to be suitable for different degrees of attenuation. When combined with weak transmission, the reduced probability of reversion provided by the new genetic technologies may make development of safe transmissible vaccines feasible.",

Individual parameters were as follows: ethical and safety concerns will likely preclude using them directly within human populations except under extraordinary circumstances [25, 26] . Instead, the real power of transmissible vaccines likely lies in their ability to improve vaccine coverage in populations of livestock and wildlife where direct vaccination of a significant proportion of the population is excessively costly or even impossible in many cases. Although transmissible vaccines have not yet been used in this capacity on a large scale, a recombinant transmissible vaccine has been developed to protect wild rabbit populations against myxomatosis [9] and to interrupt the transmission of Sin Nombre hantavirus in reservoir populations of deer mice [6] . Similar approaches could be used to develop transmissible vaccines against invasive wildlife diseases, such as West Nile virus [27] , to protect threatened wildlife populations from infectious disease [28] or to eliminate diseases like rabies from wild reservoir populations. The models we have studied here are obvious simplifications designed to make a first-pass estimate at the potential benefits that may be realized by using weakly transmissible vaccines. There are, of course, many ways in which our models could be generalized to evaluate the more nuanced biology of real populations, including spatial structure [29 -31] , heterogeneities in host populations [32 -37] , imperfect vaccines [38, 39] and the potential for vaccine and disease evolution [14, 40, 41] . Circumscribing the conditions under which transmissible vaccines will provide benefits that exceed their potential risks will ultimately require exploration of these additional complexities.",

Much of the reticence surrounding the development of transmissible vaccines stems from the justifiable concern that the potential for evolutionary reversion to wild-type virulence outweighs their potential benefits. Our results show, however, that even weakly transmissible vaccines can facilitate disease eradication and reduce disease incidence.

In intermediate scenarios (R 0 \u00bc 0.33) where our analytical results predicted vaccine transmission would reduce infection rates but fail to completely eradicate the disease, simulations showed vaccine transmission reduced the number of infected individuals by 61.8% relative to a non-transmissible vaccine and resulted in disease eradication in 39.2% of simulations (392 of 1000 simulations; figure 3b).",
