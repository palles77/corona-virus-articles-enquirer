Young children and the elderly are at particular risk, especially in developing countries: 151 million of 156 million reported episodes of childhood pneumonia are in the developing world. Pneumonia is responsible for about 17% of all deaths in children aged less than 5 years, of which more than 70% occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South-east Asia. In 2008, 1.6 million children under 5 died of pneumonia. [1] [2] [3] Pneumonia is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality at the other end of the age spectrum. The annual incidence of pneumonia in elderly, non-institutionalized patients is between 25 and 44 per 1000 population; up to four times that of patients younger than 65. 4 The most important aetiological agents of severe lower respiratory illness include bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b, and viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. Bacteria are the main causes of pneumonia, and generally have a higher case fatality rate, although this may change with the widespread introduction of H. influenzae type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, which could lead to viruses becoming much more prominent causes of respiratory disease. Viruses are the predominant cause of bronchiolitis and exacerbations of asthma and episodic viral wheeze. These clinical syndromes overlap considerably and are often difficult to tell apart.",

Infections with species B serotypes 3, 7 and 21 are associated with bronchiolitis obliterans, a post-infectious condition characterized by persistent airways obstruction secondary to peribronchiolar fibrosis. 5 Adenovirus infections are common, have a worldwide distribution and occur throughout the year. Respiratory infections are frequent during childhood, tend to be self-limiting and induce serotype-specific immunity. Outbreaks of adenoviral respiratory infections can occur in closed communities such as day-care centres, boarding schools and especially, among military recruits. 6 Adenoviruses are unusual in that prolonged asymptomatic carriage (up to 2 years in some cases) may occur in the tonsils of children. Thus, the clinical significance of adenoviruses isolated from the throats of children must be interpreted with caution.",

Third, detection may simply reflect asymptomatic persistence or prolonged viral shedding, since other human parvoviruses also show this capacity.

In contrast to H5N1 this virus does not cause disease in wild or domestic birds, making it more difficult to contain. Over a period of 2 months more than 100 cases have been identified. The case fatality rate is around 20 % and elderly people are most affected. This again highlights the unpredictability of these events and the continuously changing threats posed by influenza A viruses. The continued zoonotic transmission of these avian viruses does not imply that they will inevitably lead to another pandemic. However, the unusual severity of H5N1 and H7N9 disease in humans is a continuous cause for concern, because one cannot assume that the acquisition of human-to-human transmis sibility (if ever) will be associated with a loss of virulence (as is usual). Irrespective of whether or not this pandemic threat becomes reality, it is clear that avian H5N1 (and H7N9) viruses have already had a significant impact on the global poultry industry and on human economic and social wellbeing and thus ultimately on human health.",

            "text": "Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a rare but important cause of severe respiratory illness in the North and South American continents. It was first recognized in May 1993 during an outbreak of severe, and frequently fatal, respiratory disease in the four corners region of the USA, where the four states Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah abut. 32 The causative agent was found to be a Hantavirus and was later named Sin Nombre virus. The natural host was found to be the deer mouse, Parainfluenza Viruses (PIV). There are four species of parainfluenza virus: PIV1-4. PIV1-3 are major causes of lower respiratory tract infections in infants, young children, the immuno-compromised, the chronically ill, and the elderly. PIV1 and 2 typically cause alternating biennial fall epidemics of croup, a high-pitched barking cough in children 2-4 years of age. PIV3 infections occur mainly in the first two years of life. Bronchiolitis and pneumonia are the most common clinical presentations. Only RSV causes more lower respiratory tract infections in neonates and young infants. Both in temperate and tropical regions, there is dissociation between the peaks of activity of PIV3 and RSV/hMPV. Host defence against PIV is mediated largely by humoral immunity to the two surface antigens, but repeated infections are often needed before protection develops. 25 Rubeola Virus - Measles. There are a number of reasons why measles is often not recognized as a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections. Children with measles may not always be admitted to a general paediatric ward, the aetiology may be attributed to a super infecting pathogen rather than to measles, and some patients with measles (especially when immunocompromised) will fail to develop the typical rash. In patients who do not manifest the typical clinical features, clinical diagnosis of measles is difficult and specific laboratory diagnostics will most likely not be requested and performed. Where the diagnosis has been actively sought in developing countries, measles was found to be a major cause of lower respiratory tract infection, accounting for 6-21% of its morbidity and 8-50% of its mortality. 26 Radiographic evidence of pneumonia is common, also in clinically uncomplicated measles. The effects of the virus on the respiratory tract can be direct (giant cell pneumonitis), in any part of the respiratory tract, or indirect. The latter includes the suppressive effects of the virus on the host immune system, stores of vitamin A and overall nutritional status. All of these may lead to an increased risk of super-infection with other (viral or bacterial) pathogens. Measles pneumonitis can be especially severe in immunocompromised patients. 27 Nipah Virus. Human Nipah virus infection was first recognized in a large outbreak of 276 reported cases in peninsular Malaysia and Singapore from September 1998 through May 1999. Most patients had contact with sick pigs. Patients presented primarily with encephalitis; 39% died. Large fruit bats of the genus Pteropus are the natural reservoir of Nipah virus.",

Date palm sap is harvested from December through March, particularly in west central Bangladesh. A tap is cut into the tree trunk and sap flows slowly overnight into an open clay pot. Infrared camera studies have confirmed that Pteropus giganteus bats frequently visit the trees, lick the sap during collection, thus transmitting infection. Humans can also become infected through direct contact with bat secretions, contact with domestic animals that become infected by eating partially eaten bat-saliva-laden fruit or infected date palm sap, or by human-to-human transmission through infected saliva. 28 Chlamydophila are obligate intracellular bacteria. Chlamydophila pneumoniae is a common human respiratory pathogen and causes a similar clinical picture to Mycoplasma. It is frequently isolated from animals, but their role in transmission is unclear and spread is thought to be human to human. Serosurveys also show worldwide distribution for this bacterium. 37 Chlamydophila psittaci is the causative agent of psittacosis, a (rare) zoonotic infection related to exposure to birds which usually presents with fever, headache and myalgia and sometimes causes pneumonia. 38 Coxiella burnetii causes Q-fever. It is an obligate intracellular bacterium with a spore stage, making it highly resistant to environmental conditions. Humans are infected by aerosol inhalation and develop an acute febrile illness that is either self-limiting or develops into pneumonia or less frequently, endocarditis or a systemic chronic syndrome. Cattle, sheep and goats are the main reservoirs and when infected, shed bacteria in urine, faeces, milk and especially when giving birth. Placentas contain high concentrations of bacteria and people exposed to these are at risk. Given the environmental resilience of this organism, less direct contact with infected animals/placentas may also cause disease. There is no human-to-human spread. 39 Legionella bacteria are naturally occurring aquatic bacteria. These may grow to high concentrations in warm water, e.g. in cooling towers, heaters and drinking water plumbing, especially when associated with free-living amoebae. Aerosolization and inhalation of Legionella pneumophila may lead to (outbreaks of) a self-limited febrile illness called Pontiac fever or a more severe systemic illness with pneumonia called Legionnaires' disease. 40 Legionella and Coxiella belong to the same family of bacteria, and both are associated with a syndrome of long-lasting postinfectious fatigue.",

Both HFRS and HPS have a similar febrile prodrome with thrombocytopenia and leucocytosis. In HPS, the key differences are that the capillary leakage which follows is localized to the lungs and that, with Sin Nombre virus, renal dysfunction is minimal. There was no evidence of human-to-human transmission in this outbreak, but there is evidence that some of the South American Hantaviruses causing HPS may be transmitted between humans in a nosocomial setting. 33 Herpesviruses Varicella pneumonitis can occur as a severe complication of chickenpox or in the absence of classical symptoms. It occurs more commonly in adults, an estimated 1 : 400, and can be lifethreatening if it occurs during pregnancy or in immunocompromised patients. Although relatively rare, radiographical abnormalities of the lungs without respiratory symptoms are reported in more than 15% of adults with chickenpox. 34 Pneumonitis can also rarely occur as a complication of cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus mononucleosis. 27 Cytomegalovirus is an opportunist pathogen in immunocompromised patients in whom it can cause serious or even fatal respiratory complications. It is more important as an opportunist pathogen of transplant recipients (especially bone marrow transplants) than those immunocompromised through AIDS. Perinatal cytomegalovirus infection may occasionally present as pneumonitis in the newborn.",

This is probably not the whole story however, as in some parts of the world, RSV activity shows no pattern at all (Taiwan 62 ), or peaks during the summer months when ambient temperatures are highest (Hong Kong 63 ). Similar patterns are found for influenza virus infection. 64 Thus, for studies large enough to detect such variations, influenza activity peaks in India, North-East Brazil and Senegal, during the months with the highest rainfall and humidity. Similar seasonal variations have also been described for hMPV and PIVs. In contrast, rhinovirus, adenovirus and bocavirus infection appears, for the most part, to be endemic throughout the year. One recent study in North-East Brazil reported peaks in Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection that were unrelated to the rainy season. 41 In this study, the authors found that at its peak Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection accounted for 17% of hospitalized pneumonia cases in pre-school children, a finding with clear implications for management, given that current treatment guidelines for pneumonia in this age group do not include macrolide/quinolone antibiotics.",

Apnoea tends to occur in infants under 2 months of age and often in those born prematurely. Supportive measures are still the mainstay of treatment for bronchiolitis. Symptoms associated with clinically significant bronchiolitis (particularly RSV) are not limited to the acute episode, with many children wheezing for years afterwards.",

Most specimens are likely to come from hospitalized patients because of the practical difficulties in collecting and delivering specimens from the community. Virology specimens are perishable and must be delivered to the laboratory without delay. The quality of the specimen is paramount to obtaining meaningful results.

This is driving reference laboratories, especially in developing countries where H5N1 disease sporadically occurs, to invest in these newer technologies. In time, this will hopefully allow molecular tests for multiple respiratory pathogens (Multiplex PCR) to be undertaken in these same laboratories.
