After the introduction of the RV vaccine into the National Immunization Programme (NIP) of Finland in 2009, we conducted a prospective 2-year survey of GE in children seen in Tampere University Hospital either as outpatients or inpatients and compared the results with a similar 2-year survey conducted prior to NIP in the years 2006-2008. Compared with the pre-NIP 2-year period, in 2009-2011, hospitalizations for RVGE were reduced by 76 % and outpatient clinic visits were reduced by 81 %. NVGE showed a slight decreasing trend and accounted for 34 % of all cases of GE seen in hospital in pursuance of RVGE having decreased to 26 % (down from 52 %). In cases admitted to the hospital ward, RV accounted for 28 % and NV accounted for 37 %.The impact of RV vaccination was reflected as a 57 % decrease in all hospital admissions and 62 % decrease in all outpatient clinic visits for GE of any cause. Conclusion: RV vaccination in NIP has led to a major reduction of hospital admissions and clinic visits due to RVGE, but has had no effect on NVGE. After 2 years of NIP, NV has become the leading cause of acute GE in children seen in hospital.",

The decrease in hospitalizations in children too old to be vaccinated was 72 %, similar to the findings from the USA (70-79 %) [5, 9, 37] . We found no cases of wild-type RVGE in children <6 months of age. In contrast, in the USA, no reduction in infants <3 months of age, who had been too young to be vaccinated, was observed [5, 9, 37] .

In that sense, the present findings on the impact of universal RV vaccination on NVGE are (only) confirmatory, and we conclude that the RotaTeq vaccination program does not reduce NVGE.
