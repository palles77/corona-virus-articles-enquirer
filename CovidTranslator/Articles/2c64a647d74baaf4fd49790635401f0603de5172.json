The role of Mycoplasma cynos as an initiating agent in canine infectious respiratory disease was investigated by examining the serological response of dogs to this organism at the time of entry into a large re-homing kennel. Forty-two paired serum samples from dogs (21-day interval) were examined for antibody to M. cynos using Western blotting. The development of antibody in the serum was related to clinical disease recorded over the same period. Sixty seven per cent of the dogs showed a two-fold or greater rise in antibody to M. cynos during the first 3 weeks in the kennel. Reactivity with a 45 kDa antigen was dominant. Of those showing a positive serological reaction, 80% had recorded clinical respiratory disease while 20% remained healthy. The findings of this study show that an antibody response to M. cynos is common in dogs entering the re-homing kennel and is positively related to the development of clinical respiratory disease. #",

            "text": "Dogs entering kennels where there is a high density of other animals are frequently susceptible to respiratory disease. This has been termed ''kennel cough'', canine infectious tracheobronchitis or CIRD, and has been associated with a number of infectious agents including canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), B. bronchiseptica, canine distemper virus, canine herpesvirus and canine adenovirus Type 2 (Thrusfield, 1992) . However, instances of disease have been documented in which none of these agents or any other recognised pathogen can be found and it is likely that other, unrecognised agents may initiate disease in these cases. Recently, canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) has been implicated in CIRD (Erles et al., 2003; Priestnall et al., 2006) . Evidence that infection with M. cynos may play a role in CIRD was recently reported (Chalker et al., 2004) . To support this finding we sought serological evidence of exposure to M. cynos in the early stages of disease. While some dogs in this study showed antibody as evidence of past exposure to M. cynos or a related organism, others were free of this antibody on entry to the home. Of the 15 dogs that underwent a seroconversion, 12 suffered respiratory symptoms while only 3 remained healthy. Proportionally this was 46% of the dogs with respiratory disease compared to 19% that remained apparently healthy. This difference was statistically significant when the values of the antibody increase from the two groups were compared. This finding indicates that the antibody response to M. cynos occurring following entry into the re-homing kennel is more likely among dogs that show clinical disease. Nevertheless, overt disease may not be necessary for an initiating agent to allow colonisation by secondary pathogens. In other mycoplasma diseases it is well recognised that while the initial mycoplasma infection is mild, secondary bacterial infection may become much more likely following the initial infection (Ciprian et al., 1988 (Ciprian et al., , 1994 Amass et al., 1994) .",

In some cases B. bronchiseptica was present (Chalker et al., 2003a) while in others bhaemolytic streptococci were found (Chalker et al., 2003b) . In other cases, no obvious bacterial cause could be detected. Mycoplasmas have been known for some time to modulate host susceptibility to secondary infections (Kaklamanis and Pavlatos, 1972; Thacker et al., 1999) . In view of this, the presence of other initiating agents could be suspected and mycoplasma agents could be involved.",
