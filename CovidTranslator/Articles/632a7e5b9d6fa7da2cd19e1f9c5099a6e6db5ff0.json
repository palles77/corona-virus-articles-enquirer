            "text": "Albuminuria as the result of glomerulopathy is rarely associated with significant globulin loss. Decreased production is due to chronic hepatic insufficiency or hyperglobulinemia. The latter may cause mild hypoalbuminemia, whereas chronic hepatic insufficiency can cause moderate to severe decreases. In hyperglobulinemia, albumin synthesis may be decreased (i.e., \"down regulation\"). When inflammation is associated with hypoalbuminemia and hyperglobulinemia, albumin is sometimes called a negative acute phase protein. Inadequate protein intake (including poorly digestible protein), maldigestion, and malabsorption are rare causes of mild hypoalbuminemia; however, occasionally they accompany other conditions causing hepatic insufficiency or increased protein loss. Significant hypoalbuminemia (i.e., albumin < 2.1 g/dl) should never be attributed solely to decreased nutrition until hepatic insufficiency and proteinlosing disorders have been eliminated by definitive tests (not just by history and physical examination). Decreased intake very rarely causes serum albumin concentrations less than 2.1 g/dl, except perhaps in very young animals. ",

A urinalysis (sometimes including urine protein:creatinine ratio; see Chapter 7) and measurement of serum bile acids (see Chapter 9) are indicated. Severe cutaneous exudative lesions may be diagnosed by physical examination, but the possibility of renal, hepatic, and alimentary disease should still be investigated. Hypercholesterolemia plus hypoalbuminemia suggests protein-losing nephropathy. Significant proteinuria indicates a diagnostic workup for protein-losing nephropathy (PLN) (see Chapter 7). Hypocholesterolemia plus hypoalbuminemia is suggestive of hepatic insufficiency or PLE. Hypoalbuminemia associated with hepatomegaly; microhepatia; neurologic signs; icterus; decreased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) with or without increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP), or both; or abnormal hepatic function test results (e.g., serum bile acids) requires a diagnostic workup for hepatic insufficiency (see Chapter 9). NOTE: ALT and SAP are normal in many patients with severe hepatic disease. A portosystemic shunt is more likely in young animals; however, congenital shunts can be diagnosed in animals more than 10 years old. Acquired hepatic disease is more common in adults and requires hepatic biopsy for diagnosis; however, some dogs less than 1 year old have severe, acquired hepatic disease. Hypoalbuminemia with normal liver function tests and absence of proteinuria or cutaneous lesions allows one to diagnose PLE by exclusion (see Chapter 9), even if feces are normal. If the patient has renal or hepatic disease and PLE is still a concern, then measurement of fecal alpha-1 protease inhibitor concentrations (Chapter 9) may allow diagnosis of PLE by inclusion. Intestinal biopsy may then provide a definitive diagnosis of which intestinal disease is causing PLE. Endoscopic biopsies are safer, but it is critical that excellent quality tissue samples be obtained (many endoscopically-obtained samples are nondiagnostic). Exploratory laparotomy is acceptable. If laparotomy is performed, hepatic biopsy should generally be performed along with intestinal biopsies. It is important to 292 Small Animal Clinical Diagnosis by Laboratory Methods obtain biopsy specimens at several sites along the small intestine, even when no apparent gross lesions are found. Edematous SC fluid accumulations associated with hypoalbuminemia are usually transudates: PLN or PLE, chronic hepatic insufficiency, and immune-mediated or infectious vasculitis may be responsible. However, one should always sample fluid accumulations to be sure that they are in fact transudates, as opposed to unexpected modified transudates or exudates.",

A routine protein electrophoresis performed on a concentrated urine sample occasionally detects an isolated monoclonal peak in the urine (e.g., Bence Jones protein). Finding a urine electrophoresis pattern mimicking that of serum indicates a glomerular lesion substantial enough to allow leakage of most serum proteins, including the serum monoclonal heavy chain peak; therefore, it is not evidence of Bence Jones light chains.

Monoclonal immunoglobulin elevations are also called paraproteins or M proteins and are usually the result of lymphocyte and plasma cell neoplasias (e.g., multiple myeloma, macroglobulinemia, lymphosarcoma; see Table 12 -3). Monoclonal or oligoclonal spikes are occasionally caused by infectious (e.g., ehrlichiosis; see Figure 12 -2) or idiopathic disorders. Both multiple myeloma and ehrlichiosis can have monoclonal electrophoretic patterns and bone marrow plasmacytosis. In ehrlichiosis, however, the electrophoretic pattern is often a monoclonal or oligoclonal pattern superimposed on or arising within a broader-based globulin peak (see Figure 12 -2, top). In such cases, examination of the stained electrophoretogram bands shows a clearly restricted monoclonal band with sharper edges within a paler, broader background band.

Congenital combined or selective immunodeficiencies occur but are rarely diagnosed, probably because immunodeficient puppies or kittens rapidly succumb to infections. In dogs these infections are usually distemper or parvovirus, and they occur in the postnatal period after maternal immunity wanes. Immunodeficiency should be suspected when more than one pup in a properly cared for litter dies of infection in the first 2 to 6 months of life. Complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry profile, serum protein electrophoresis, and immunoelectrophoresis are typical initial tests in such situations. Immunoglobulin quantitation by RID or rocket electrophoresis is recommended for confirmation and characterization of the type of immunoglobulin deficiency present.",

Selective (single class or subclass) and partial immunoglobulin deficiencies may not be readily detectable via serum electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis; all immunoglobulin classes (and IgG subclasses when available) should be quantitated when a humoral immunodeficiency is suspected. Humoral immunodeficiency is usually detected by finding decreased IgG and IgA and normal to decreased IgM concentrations. Selective IgA deficiency and transient hypogammaglobulinemia occur in dogs; patients with selective IgA deficiency may show chronic problems involving mucosal immunity (e.g., antibiotic responsive enteropathy) or be asymptomatic. Serum electrophoresis in cases of selective or partial immunoglobulin deficiency may yield normal results or even show polyclonal elevations in globulins. Immunoelectrophoresis of normal canine serum may show a low or absent stainable IgA precipitation band because of IgA's relatively low concentration or the result of quality assurance problems involving antisera or technique. When selective IgA deficiency is suspected, the best diagnostic test is quantitative RID or rocket electrophoresis. IgA deficiency is sometimes accompanied by elevated concentrations of IgM or IgG.",

In addition, low concentrations of serum IgA have been associated with canine allergic and parasitic disorders, with return to normal after successful therapy. This finding suggests that those disease processes may lead to down regulation of IgA as an immunomodulation event, and low IgA probably has no causative role in the underlying chronic inflammatory bowel disease (Hill, Moriello, and DeBoer, 1995) .

Canine RFs are predominantly IgG but may also be mixed complexes of IgG, IgA, and IgM. Factors are detected by incubating rabbit IgGsensitized sheep red blood cells (RBCs) with serial dilutions of the patient's serum (the rabbit Rose-Waaler test). If RF is present, agglutination occurs. Because canine sera often contain naturally occurring antibodies to sheep RBCs, a control must be used with unsensitized sheep RBCs. If agglutination to an equal or higher dilution appears in the control, natural antibodies must be absorbed from the sera before testing for RF. Latex agglutination tests for canine RF are not recommended because results are poorly reproducible and lack specificity. Latex agglutination titers may differ substantially from Rose-Waaler titers. Both tests are available through human laboratories; proper test controls are necessary.",

In the Rose-Waaler test, a differential titer of greater than or equal to 1:8 is positive for RF (Barta, 1993) . Between 40% and 75% of dogs with RA have a positive RF test result. Hence, a negative result does not eliminate RF. The RF test is rarely positive in normal dogs and occasionally positive in some patients with SLE, because RF may be a part of the SLE complex. Incidence of RF in other arthropathies and systemic diseases has not been adequately studied via the Rose-Waaler method, but other methods have shown RF (in titers comparable with those of patients with RA) in these arthropathies (Carter et al, 1989) . Therefore a positive RF test result should never be the sole criterion for a diagnosis of canine RA.RA is a progressive, erosive, immunemediated polyarthritis that must be differentiated from other types of joint diseases, preferably before joint destruction occurs. Unfortunately no test for canine RF is highly reliable in making this distinction. Other routine tests indicated in making the diagnosis include joint radiographs and synovial fluid analysis. Septic polyarthritis often causes erosive lesions, especially involving larger joints, plus evidence of sepsis on routine blood and synovial fluid examinations (see Chapter 10), including culture. In contrast, RA typically causes erosive lesions of smaller peripheral joints before progressing to larger joints. Radiographic lesions may be lacking or inconclusive early in the course of RA. Furthermore, no distinguishing cytologic features can reliably differentiate among RA, SLE, and other types of immune-mediated joint disease that have similar joint fluid cytology.
