Subsequent PCR testing confirmed the presence of either a bocavirus 313 or fechavirus or both (n=1 cat #283) of these viruses in all but one of the seventeen sick cats 314 tested (cat #178). The outbreak in shelter 2 predominantly tested positive for FeBoV (7/9 FeBoV 315 +ve and 2/9 fechavirus +ve) while the sick cats in shelter 3 were mainly shedding fechavirus (6/7 316 fechavirus +ve, 2/7 FeBov +ve). Another cat housed in shelter 2 who developed vomiting after 317 sick cats were transferred back from Shelter 3 was also shedding fechavirus as well as a novel 318 dependovirus. The co-detection of these viral genomes indicate that fechavirus may provide the 319 required help for replication-defective dependoviruses. 320 FPV and feline FCV reads were determined to originate from recently inoculated attenuated 321 vaccine strains while other viruses were deemed to be asymptomatic infections, derived from 322 author/funder.

Some of the most prevalent feline enteric viruses include FBoV, FeAstV, FRV, and FPV 44 (Ng et al., 2014; Otto et al., 2015; W. Zhang et al., 2014). Conditions in animal shelters 45 contribute to pathogen emergence due to factors including intensive housing, rapid population 46 turnover, animal stress, and the presence of many direct and indirect routes of possible exposure 47 (Pesavento & Murphy, 2014). 48 The Parvoviridae family consists of non-enveloped, icosahedral, viruses with single stranded 49 DNA genomes of 4 to 6Kb (Cotmore & Tattersall, 2014; Mietzsch, Penzes, & Agbandje-50 McKenna, 2019). Eight ICTV approved genera are currently included in the Parvoviridae family 51 (Cotmore et al., 2019). A recent reorganization of the Parvoviridae has proposed the creation of 52 a third subfamily named Hamaparvovirinae that includes invertebrate and vertebrate viruses as 53 well as endogenized genomes in the germ lines of fish and invertebrates suggesting an ancient 54 origin (Penzes, de Souza, Agbandje-McKenna, & Gifford, 2019; Souza et al., 2017). Vertebrate 55 infecting members of this subfamily are classified within the Chaphamaparvovirus genus 56 (previously labeled as unclassified or chapparvoviruses) have been identified in rats and mice 57 (Williams et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2016), bats (Baker et al., 2013; Yinda et al., 2018), rhesus 58 macaques (Kapusinszky, Ardeshir, Mulvaney, Deng, & Delwart, 2017), cynomologus macaques 59",

Twelve samples representing 15 cats (i.e. 176 including two pools of multiple samples) were subjected to a comprehensive IDEXX feline 177 diarrhea panel pathogen screen (see materials and methods). FECV was detected in one sample, 178 Giardia DNA in 3 samples, and Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin DNA in 6 out of 11 cats that 179 tested, while Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin results were negative for all animals. 180 Clostridium perfringens is part of the normal feline intestinal flora; diarrheic and clinically 181 healthy cats shed the organism at similar rates (Marks, Rankin, Byrne, & Weese, 2011). Type A, 182 the most commonly isolated biotype, produces alpha-toxin and is commonly detected in feces of 183 both diarrheic and healthy dogs (Gizzi et al., 2014). It is not considered a primary cause of 184 diarrhea in cats, but may contribute to diarrhea in cases where a disturbance in the intestinal 185 microenvironment has occurred, such as due to concurrent pathogen infection (Adam, 2014). 186 Giardia is a protozoal parasite that can infect multiple mammalian species and can be associated 187 with diarrhea (and rarely, vomiting) in cats (Janeczko & Griffin, 2010). It has a prepatent period 188 of 5-16 days and while it can cause shelter outbreaks, it would not be capable of causing disease 189 only 24 hours after exposure (Janeczko & Griffin, 2010); a shelter outbreak of Giardia would 190 have a more indolent course. FRV was negative for all samples tested, only one sample (from a 191 pooled litter) was positive for FPV. These tests ruled out the primary bacterial differentials for a 192 shelter outbreak with a short incubation period. None of the positive organisms were considered 193 the main cause of the vomiting and diarrhea outbreak. 194",

Lyon-IARC DNA was previously shown to be shed by 3/5 cat feces in a hoarding 207 situation diarrhea outbreak (one of which was co-infected with FPV) (Fahsbender, Altan, Estrada, 208 et al., 2019; W.

That vaccine was 220 also sequenced using metagenomics yielding the near complete genome of the FCV (deposited in 221 GenBank MN868063), approximately 85.8% of the FPV genome, and more than 20,000 reads of 222 the herpes virus. Felocell 3 vaccine derived FPV and FCV sequences were compared to those 223 detected by metagenomics in two and four of the diarrheic cats respectively.

The two genomes share 99.1% 243 identity of NS1 and 99.6% identity of VP1 at protein level, and 99.2% and 99.3% at nucleotide 244 level. These genomes encoded the two main ORFs shared by all parvoviruses, a 658aa ORF 245 encoding non-structural replication protein (NS1), and a 508aa ORF encoding viral capsid (VP1). 246 The closest relative to these genomes was a parvovirus recently reported in canine feces named 247 cachavirus (MK448316)(Fahsbender, Altan, Seguin, et al., 2019), with a nucleotide identity of 248 74.2% and NS1 and VP1 protein identity of 65.5% and 68.8% respectively. Other major ORFs 249 consisted of a 186aa ORF within the NS1 labeled NP and a potential 248aa ORF overlapping the 250 5'-UTR and NS1. The NP ORF is widely conserved in chaphamaparvoviruses (Christopher J. 251 Jolly, 2019; Roediger et al., 2018). No significant similarity was found for the 248aa ORF. 252 Under an April 2019 ICTV proposal updating the latest published classification (Cotmore et 253 al., 2019) members of the same parvovirus species should show >85% identity for NS1. The 254 fechavirus genome therefore qualifies as a member of a new species in the proposed 255 Chaphamaparvovirus genus. We named this novel virus feline chaphamaparvovirus or 256 fechavirus. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the closest relative to be the canine cachavirus in 257 both NS and VP ORFs (Figure 3B and C). 258 primers were designed based on the fechavirus genomes and used to test all 17 259 fecal samples. Besides the six fechavirus positive fecal samples detected by NGS, two more 260 samples were positive by PCR. All four vomit samples tested (from unknown cats in shelter 3) 261 were also PCR positive. A total of 8 animals therefore shed fechavirus of which one was co-262 infected with FeBoV3 (Cat #283). Of the 17 animals available for analyzes only one was 263 negative for both FeBoV and fechavirus DNA (cat # 178). 264 Longitudinally collected fecal samples were collected from 4 cats and PCR tested for 265 fechavirus DNA. Cat #688 was fechavirus positive on the last day of his illness; while cats #912 266 and #283 were positive for a single time point while disease signs were manifest for a further 4 267 or 9 more days.

FeBoV1 was first 296 discovered in in multiple tissues of cats in Hong Kong (Lau et al., 2012) and subsequently 297 reported in cat feces in the US, Japan, Europe and China (Ng et al., 2014; Takano et al., 2016; Yi 298 et al., 2018; W.

Similarly to human bocaparvovirus DNA commonly found 299 in the feces of healthy humans (Jartti et al., 2012; Kapoor et al., 2010; Ong, Schuurman, & 300 Heikens, 2016), frequent feline bocaparvovirus DNA detection in healthy cats raise questions 301 regarding its pathogenicity in cats (Diakoudi et al., 2019; Lau et al., 2012; Ng et al., 2014; 302 Piewbang, Kasantikul, Pringproa, & Techangamsuwan, 2019; W. Zhang et al., 2014). A recent 303 study showed a possible association between FBoV-1 infection, potentially aggravated by FPV, 304 and hemorrhagic enteritis (Diakoudi et al., 2019; Lau et al., 2012; Ng et al., 2014; Piewbang et 305 al., 2019; W. Zhang et al., 2014). FPV is an extensively studied pathogen that can lead to 306 reduction in circulating white blood cell and enteritis (Barrs, 2019; Truyen & Parrish, 2013). The 307 pathogenicity of FeBuV in cats is currently unknown (Diakoudi et al., 2019; Stuetzer & 308 Hartmann, 2014) but the virus shares very high sequence identity with a canine bufavirus 309 (Diakoudi et al., 2019; J.

One animal shed fechavirus 330 DNA during all twelve days of sampling both while exhibiting disease signs and seven days after 331 disease resolution. The short duration of fechavirus shedding for 3/4 animals, also typical of FPV 332 shedding (Bergmann et al., 2019), may account for its non-detection in some of the affected 333 animals in shelter 2 and 3. All but one of the fechavirus negative samples were positive for one 334 of three different feline bocavirus indicating that both bocaviruses and fechavirus were 335 circulating in these shelters. Because of the high diversity of bocaviruses found here, belonging 336 to three distinct species, and the typically asymptomatic nature of FeBoV infections, a role for 337 bocaviruses in the multi-facility transmission of this disease outbreak seems unlikely. A 338 pathogenic role for fechavirus seems more likely as viral DNA was detected in key animals with 339 contacts across the three facilities experiencing outbreaks with similar disease signs. 340 A key clinical attribute of this unusual outbreak was the prominence of indirect routes of 341 transmission, including ongoing fomite transmission after robust control measures were 342 implemented. Another notable characteristic of this case was the very short minimum incubation 343 period. Combined with the absence of any known pathogen identified on routine screening, this 344 points to a novel non-enveloped enteric virus as the most likely causative agent. Animal shelters 345 and veterinary hospitals should maintain good routine infection control procedures and consider 346 novel viruses, including fechavirus, in the diagnosis of feline gastrointestinal disease. 347In this study, we characterized the virome from a cat diarrhea and vomiting outbreak, and 348 showed that besides different FeBoV, a new chaphamaparvovirus was associated with 349 gastrointestinal disease. Future studies on its prevalence, genetic diversity, and tissue distribution 350 in healthy and diarrheic cats are needed to further investigate a possible etiologic role in",

A total of 43 cats met the case definition 139 (see methods). 17 samples from 19 cats (including a pool of samples from 3 cats), plus four 140 vomit samples, were available for further studies. 141 The outbreak was first identified on November 24, 2018 in Shelter 2 when 8/12 cats housed 142 in the main adoption room became sick with vomiting and diarrhea. Diet, environmental, and 143 toxic causes of the outbreak were ruled out clinically and an outbreak investigation initiated. The 144 first cases in Shelter 2 (#614, #853) had arrived from Shelter 1 via the organization's animal 145 transfer program on November 15, 2018 and were sick during or shortly after transport. Upon 146 further investigation, the originating shelter, Shelter 1, had 11 more sick cats. On November 20, 147",
