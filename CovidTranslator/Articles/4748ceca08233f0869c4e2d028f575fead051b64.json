Based on clinical studies, SARS-CoV (the SARS-associated coronavirus), a novel coronavirus, is reported as the pathogen responsible for the disease. To date, no e\u00a1ective and speci\u00a2c therapeutic method can be used to treat patients su\u00a1ering from SARS-CoV infection. RNA interference (RNAi) is a process by which the introduced small interfering RNA (siRNA) could cause the degradation of mRNA with identical sequence speci\u00a2city. The RNAi methodology has been used as a tool to silence genes in cultured cells and in animals. Recently, this technique was employed in anti-virus infections in human immunode\u00a2ciency virus and hepatitis C/B virus. In this study, RNAi technology has been applied to explore the possibility for prevention of SARS-CoV infection. We constructed speci\u00a2c siRNAs targeting the S gene in SARS-CoV. We demonstrated that the siRNAs could e\u00a1ectively and speci\u00a2cally inhibit gene expression of Spike protein in SARS-CoV-infected cells. Our study provided evidence that RNAi could be a tool for inhibition of SARS-CoV. \u00df 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Biochemical Societies.",

The ectodomain of the Spike protein is extensively glycosylated with N-linked glycosylation and seems important for the interaction with the receptors on the surface of the host cells. The conformation change through dimerization of the Spike protein is reported to be critical for the fusion event between the viral envelope and cellular membrane for the coronavirus family [9] . Therefore, binding of antibody to the Spike protein could block the viron entrance into host cells for some of the coronaviruses.",

Using poliovirus as a model, Gitlin et al. [17] demonstrated that siRNA could e\u00a1ectively protect human cells against infection by a rapidly replicating and highly cytolytic RNA virus. Hu et al. [18] reported that siRNA could block retroviral infection in chick embryos and inhibit the growth of the Rous sarcoma virus and human immunode\u00a2ciency virus (HIV) in cell culture. They found that the siRNA primarily prevented accumulation of the viral RNAs synthesized in the late stage of the infection, but did not degrade the RNA genome in the virus in the early stage of the infection. Other groups reported that siRNA could speci\u00a2cally inhibit HIV-1 replication and virus propagation [19] through targeting major genes in the HIV life cycle, including p24 (the HIV long terminal repeat) [20, 21] , vif, nef [19] , tat and rev [22, 23] .",

The cDNA encoding the Spike protein from SARS-CoV was constructed into pCMV-Myc, a mammalian expression vector with a CMV promoter, which could drive the expression of the Spike protein in cultured cells. To detect the protein expression, the cDNA of Spike protein was tagged with HA at the C-terminus ( Fig. 2A, top panel) . This construct was transfected into 293T cells and the expression of Spike protein was measured by Western blot. The data showed that the vector could drive the expression of Spike protein of SARS-CoV in the cells at a high level (Fig. 2 , top panel, lane 1) although the molecular weight of the expressed protein ( s 90 kDa) was smaller than the predicted one (105 kDa). To avoid di\u00a1erent transfection e\u2044ciencies, we balanced the total amount of DNA with an EGFP expression vector. The data showed that the EGFP expressions were very even (Fig. 2, bottom panel, lanes 1, 3, and 4) and L-actin level showed equal loading of samples (Fig. 2, middle panel) , suggesting that the transfection experiments were controlled under identical conditions.

To validate the siRNA e\u00a1ects on replication of SARS-CoV, we performed virus titration assays by assaying for extracellular virus in infected cells 72 h post infection. The data showed that the control plate had high titers of virus (Fig. 7, lane 1) , suggesting the virus replicated in the cells during the 72 h culture period. In contrast, the virus titer was dramatically decreased in the plate where the cells were transfected with siRNA ( Fig. 7 , lanes 2 and 3), demonstrating that the siRNA inhibited virus replication.

However, the structure of the virus is similar to the other coronaviruses, which contain a spike protein thought to play an important role in viral entry and pathogenesis [9] . In an attempt to prevent and inhibit SARS-CoV replication, we employed RNAi technology, which has been used to silence virus gene expression in HIV and HCV/HBV. In this paper, we provide evidence that a DNA vector-based siRNA could e\u00a1ectively and speci\u00a2cally inhibit gene expression of the Spike protein from SARS-CoV. Initially, we showed that siRNAs silenced the expression of Spike protein in cells transfected with S gene expression vector. Both Western blot and immunostaining experiments consistently suggested that the DNA vectors carrying the siRNA hairpin targeted the overexpressed S gene in cells. We also showed that the mRNA level was decreased when siRNAs were transfected into the cells. This model system demonstrated the inhibition of gene expression of the virus as in the case of inhibition of HIV and HCV/HBV [18,19,21^23,27,28,31^33] .",
