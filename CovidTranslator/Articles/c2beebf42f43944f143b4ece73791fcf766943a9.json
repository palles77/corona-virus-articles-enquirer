All compounds were evaluated in vitro for activity against a broad variety of DNA and RNA viruses. One compound was slightly active against human cytomegalovirus in HEL cell cultures (EC 50 = 45 lM) while another showed weak activity against varicella-zoster virus (TK ? VZV strain OKA and TK -VZV strain 07-1) with EC 50 = 43 and 53 lM, respectively. In addition, several compounds exhibited noticeable inhibitory effects on the proliferation of human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) at a concentration lower than 200 lM. Graphical abstract",

Nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir, ganciclovir, and penciclovir as well as acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs), namely adefovir, cidofovir, and tenofovir, belong to the most widely used antiviral drugs ( Fig. 1 ) [4] [5] [6] . The ribose moiety in natural nucleosides/ nucleotides was replaced by linear or branched aliphatic units to obtain analogues with specific activity following activation by viral and/or cellular kinases. The antiviral activity of these compounds relies on enzyme inhibition or on incorporation as active metabolites into the viral nucleic acids resulting in inhibition of viral genome replication.",

Many nucleoside/nucleotide analogues and their derivatives are currently under preclinical and clinical trials [7] which demonstrates how rapidly this area of research grows. However, some of these analogues have poor oral bioavailability and are associated with toxicity, limiting their application for treatment of cancer and viral infections. Moreover, a long-term treatment with antiviral drugs may result in lower sensitivity of the viruses to chemotherapeutics (drug resistance) [8, 9] . For this reason, a search for new compounds with higher antiviral and antitumor activities, good bioavailability, better solubility, and proper balance between efficacy and long-term toxicity still continues.",

Thus, diethyl aminomethylphosphonate (2a) was prepared in total 90 % yield from N-(bromomethyl)phthalimide followed by the treatment with hydrazine [19] [20] [21] whereas x-aminoalkylphosphonates 2b-2d were synthesized from the corresponding x-azidoalkylphosphonates 1b-1d [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] by catalytic hydrogenation [23, 26] . However, several literature reports [33, 34] noticed the formation of significant amounts of symmetrical secondary amines as by-products during hydrogenolysis of azides depending on the azide concentration and the azide to catalyst ratio. When xazidophosphonates 1b-1d were subjected to hydrogenation in the presence of 10 % Pd-C, symmetrical secondary amines 3b-3d contaminated (11-33 %) the major phosphonates 2b-2d as judged from the 31 P NMR spectra (Scheme 2). The mixtures of x-aminoalkylphosphonates 2b-2d containing various amounts of symmetrical secondary amines 3b-3d were separated on silica gel columns.",

It was found that the acyclic phosphonate analogues 10a and 10d containing the N 3benzoyluracil group as a modified nucleobase exhibited noticeable activity. Thus, compound 10a showed activity against cytomegalovirus (AD-169 strain) in human embryonic lung (HEL) cells (EC 50 = 45 lM), whereas compound 10d proved to be active against VZV (TK ? strain OKA and TKstrain 07-1) with EC 50 = 43 and 53 lM, respectively. The antiviral activity of compound 10d against VZV TKstrain 07-1 appeared to be slightly better than the activity of acyclovir and brivudin used as reference compounds (EC 50 = 160 and 103 lM, respectively). To rationalize the observed activity of the N 3benzoyl derivatives 10a and 10d one can refer to their easier transport through cell membranes in comparison to the precursors 5a and 5d which appeared inactive. After entering into the cell debenzoylation would provide nucleoside analogues capable of Watson-Crick bas pairing. Our previous results [44] support this conclusion.",

Solid AgCl was washed with dry toluene (2 9 8 cm 3 ) to remove the residual 3-ethoxyacryloyl isocyanate which was added to the reaction flask. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The solid residue was filtered through a layer of Celite and the solvent was evaporated. The crude product was chromatographed on a silica gel column with chloroform-methanol mixtures (100:1, 20:1 v/v) to afford phosphonates 4a-4d.
