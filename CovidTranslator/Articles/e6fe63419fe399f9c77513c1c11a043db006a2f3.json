Computational methods are broadly divided into three types: machine learning-based methods combining intrinsic and context-dependent features (Deng et al. 2011; Cheng et al. 2013) , flux balance analysis-based methods (Kuepfer et al. 2005; del Rio et al. 2009; Gatto et al. 2015) , and homology search and evolutionary analysis-based methods (Peng et al. 2012; Wei et al. 2013) .

Their results showed high consistency, which further confirmed the accuracy and robustness of the essential gene sets (Fraser 2015) . These studies provided an in-depth analysis of tumor-specific essential genes and feasible methods to screen tumor-specific essential genes (Fraser 2015; Moffat 2016). The essential genes screened by these three teams provided a clear definition of the requirements for sustaining the basic cell activities of individual human tumor cell types. Practically, these genes can be regarded as targets for cancer treatment (Fraser 2015) . The data from these three groups provided a rare opportunity to theoretically study the function, sequence composition, evolution and network topology of human essential genes. One of the most important and interesting theoretical issues in modern biology is whether essential genes and non-essential genes can be accurately classified using computational methods.

These context-dependent features included those features extracted from experimental omics data. However, the features derived from experimental data are frequently unavailable; consequently, this type of machine learning model cannot be extended to a wide range of genomes.

To comprehensively assess the method used in the present study, we repeated the holdout method 100 times to identify differences in the composition of the training and testing samples.

Therefore, P(A) was obtained based on the number of selected features in each group divided by 800, and P(E) was calculated by dividing the number of total features in each group by 4,545. P(A) and P(E) are listed in columns 4 and 5, respectively. If P(A) is higher than P(E), then the group makes a higher-than-average contribution to the identification of essential genes. We calculated the tendentiousness using the formula P(A)/P(E)-1 to denote how the features of each group were selected, and the results are listed in column 6 of Table 2 . We further conducted a hypergeometric distribution test for each group, and the p values are listed in column 7. Figure 1 (B) and Table 2 show that fv 2,0 (p = 1.60E-06), fv 2,1 (p = 0.02407688), and fv 3,0 (p = 7.89E-05) are preferentially selected and are statistically significant. These results demonstrated that there are strong signals for classifying essential and non-essential genes when the character interval is equal to zero or one, but the other groups did not show these strong signals. To further confirm this result, the variables fv 2,0 , fv 2,1 , fv 2,2 , fv 2,3 , fv 2,4 , fv 2,5 and fv 3,0 , fv 3,1 , fv 3,2 , fv 3,3 , fv 3,4 , and fv 3,5 were used as input features. Improved performance was obtained under fv 2,0 , fv 2,1 , and fv 3,0 compared with the other groups (Table 2, column 8). Those results demonstrated that the shorter interval association provides more information. However, longer interval association can still play an independent role. Hence, integrating the interval information into adjacent ones could significantly improve our classifier's capacity of discernment (Table 1) .",

Pheg can predict whether a query gene is essential using only the CDS region of a gene as input. We integrated logistic regression into the Pheg server to estimate the reliability of the predicted results. Hence, this server can output a probabilistic estimated value as a measurement of gene essentiality for the inputted coding region.

Although the two adjacent nucleotides in the primary structure have no association in some cases, strong associations in terms of tertiary structure might exist. Therefore, we introduced the \u03bb -interval Z-curve to virtually represent the interval range association. The details of this method are described as p k (S w X), which represents the frequency of oligonucleotides S w X in genes or ORFs, where X is one of the four basic bases A, T, G and C. To facilitate this presentation, the length of the oligonucleotide S w is represented as w. According to the predetermined characters, we generated the universal equation for the \u03bb -interval Z-curve based on Z-curve theory as follows:",

The details of these genes are supplemented in Supplemental Information S2. Additionally, we used these 118 gene sequences to conduct a BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search against essential genes in the genome of Mus musculus (mouse). The current mouse essential gene set is accessible in the OGEE database(Chen et al. 2012). Considering that no BLAST program is embedded in OGEE, we downloaded the essential gene annotations (gene_essentiality) at (http://ogee.medgenius.info/downloads/) and extracted the essential gene annotation of M. musculus. We obtained the essential gene sequences according to the annotations (http://ogee.medgenius.info/downloads/). A BLAST search was performed via ncbi-blast-2.2.30+-win64.exe using the data from OGEE, and homologs for 21 genes were identified (e value < 1e-100) among the 118 predicted essential genes. The sequences of the essential genes in M. musculus are provided in Supplemental Information S3.

Blomen et al. and Wang et al. identified the essential genes in the KBM7 cell line. We combined these two datasets into one gene set, KBM7. A total of 2,073 and 386 essential genes were contained in the two datasets for HCT116. The 386 genes in this dataset were markedly different from those in the datasets for the other cell lines, so this dataset was excluded. Ultimately, 11 essential gene sets were obtained, corresponding to a single cell line. Essential genes, by definition, are indispensable for the survival of organisms under optimized growth conditions and are considered the foundation of life",
