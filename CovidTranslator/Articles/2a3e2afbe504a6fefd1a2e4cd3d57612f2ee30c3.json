The ability of microorganisms to colonize the oropharynx and to cause lower respiratory tract infections is determined in part by the interaction of specific microbial adhesins with cellular receptors. For example, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which contains multiple adhesions, 2 binds to the receptor for platelet-activating factor on epithelial cells, and this interaction is enhanced by cigarette smoke, infection with respiratory viruses, and particulate air pollutants, [3] [4] [5] all of which are linked to increased risk for pneumococcal pneumonia. Likewise, Staphylococcus aureus expresses multiple adhesins that bind host extracellular matrix proteins. 6, 7 Gram-negative bacterial pathogens also possess specific adhesins, many of which form macromolecular structures, termed pili. Klebsiella pneumoniae exploits two distinct pili to adhere to epithelial cells: type 1 pili bind to diverse host target molecules with exposed mannose residues, and type 3 pili interact with extracellular matrix proteins. 8 Several mechanisms in the airways prevent adherence and colonization by potential bacterial pathogens. dures are performed, the responsible pathogen is not isolated in up to 50% to 60% of patients with severe CAP.",

In addition to protection provided by host factors, the upper airway microbiota may modulate susceptibility to pathogens, as indicated by the evidence that broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy predisposes to colonization and infection. The effects of the microbiota operate through competition for binding sites or nutritional resources, or by modulating expression of specific host defense molecules. [12] [13] [14] [15] Interactions between the virulence and quantity of aspirated or inhaled microorganisms and the individual's innate and adaptive immune responses determine whether pneumonia develops. 16 As an alternative to aspiration of bacteria of the upper airways, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila species, Coxiella burnetii, Legionella, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis enter the lower respiratory tract by inhalation. Inhalation pneumonia is most often due to microorganisms that survive suspended in the air for prolonged periods, are present in droplet nuclei smaller than 5 \u00b5m, and are able to evade innate immune responses.",

Rodent contact suggests the possibility of infection with Yersinia pestis (plague) in the rural southwestern United States 46 and Francisella tularensis (tularemia) in rural Arkansas or Nantucket, Massachusetts. 47 Exposure to sheep, dogs, and cats should prompt evaluation for Coxiella burnetii (Q fever). 48 The role of seasonal timing is illustrated by the increased incidence of lower respiratory tract infections due to S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in winter months.

Patients with COPD have an increased risk for CAP, due to alterations in mechanical and cellular defenses that allow bacterial colonization of the lower airways. Patients with severe COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second < 30% of predicted) and bronchiectasis have an increased risk for pneumonia caused by H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa. 38 In patients with COPD treated with oral corticosteroids for long periods, the risk for infection with Aspergillus species is increased. 39 Pneumonia remains the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis. During the first decade of life, S. aureus and nontypeable H. influenzae are the most common pathogens, although P. aeruginosa is occasionally isolated in infants. By 18 years of age, 80% of patients with cystic fibrosis harbor P. aeruginosa and 3.5% harbor Burkholderia cepacia. 40 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, and nontuberculous mycobacteria are emerging pathogens in this population. 41 Other comorbidities associated with increased rates of CAP and consequent mortality include congestive heart failure, chronic kidney or liver disease, cancer, diabetes, dementia, cerebrovascular diseases, and immunodeficiencies (e.g., neutropenia, lymphoproliferative diseases, immunoglobulin deficiencies, and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection). [42] [43] [44] In contrast, the syndrome of gradual onset of fever, nonproductive cough, and a relatively normal white blood cell count in a patient without a readily demonstrable bacterial pathogen has been called \"atypical pneumonia.\" Frequently, systemic complaints are more prominent than the respiratory ones. The atypical syndrome is characteristic of infections by pathogens such as M. pneumoniae, Chlamydophila species, C. burnetii, and viruses. However, several studies, including one that included patients with mild CAP treated on an outpatient basis, 57 have found that neither the clinical symptoms nor the radiographic manifestations are sufficiently sensitive or specific to guide pathogen-directed antibiotic treatment against \"typical\" versus \"atypical\" microorganisms. 57 Therefore, current guidelines do not emphasize the use of the typical versus atypical classification to determine initial empirical antibiotic treatment for CAP.

The initial presentation is frequently acute, with an intense chill. Productive cough is present, and the sputum is purulent or bloody. Pleuritic pain may suggest S. pneumoniae. Physical examination reveals typical findings of pulmonary consolidation (see Chapter 16) . Blood tests show leukocytosis with neutrophilia and the presence of band forms in most cases.

Finally, the examiner must look for the presence of complications such as pleural effusion, pericarditis, endocarditis, arthritis, and central nervous system involvement, which may necessitate further diagnostic procedures and, potentially, a change in therapy. 61",

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest provides a more sensitive means of detecting minor radiographic abnormalities. 59 However, a chest CT is not recommended for patients with suspected pneumonia who have an apparently normal chest radiograph. 21 Although several radiographic patterns have been associated with pneumonia caused by specific microorganisms, the presence of a certain pattern is not a reliable method for diagnosing a specific pathogen. 66, 67 Nonetheless, the presence of air bronchograms and a lobar (eFig. 33-1) or segmental pattern is more characteristic of typical than atypical causes of pneumonia. In contrast, a mixed pattern (alveolar and interstitial disease (eFig. 33-2) is more frequently observed with atypical pneumonias.

The presence of more than 10 squamous epithelial cells per lowpower field (\u00d7100 magnification) indicates excessive oropharyngeal contamination and the specimen should be discarded because it is not representative of the pulmonary milieu. 18 A specimen with few or no squamous cells and men does not corroborate the presence of these bacteria. In good quality Gram-stained sputum, the presence of a single or a preponderant morphotype of bacteria (\u226590%) is considered diagnostic. In the absence of an informative Gram stain, the predictive value of sputum culture is very low.",

For patients with HAP or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), the range of potential pathogens is so broad and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns so diverse that vigorous diagnostic measures are justified. In ventilated patients, the equivalent of sputum is the endotracheal aspirate for which the criteria for validity are the same as those for sputum. Although the Gram stain and qualitative cultures of endotracheal aspirates have excellent sensitivity, they have poor specificity. 70 Quantitative cultures of endotracheal aspirate samples may help distinguish colonization from infection. However, there has been difficulty in choosing a quantitative threshold for VAP; some have chosen to consider a range of quantitative cultures, from 10 3 to 10 6 CFU/mL, rather than a single cutoff. 71 Some bacterial agents of pneumonia cannot be cultivated on conventional laboratory media. For example, Legionella requires buffered charcoal yeast extract agar for isolation, whereas recovery of Chlamydophila species and C. burnetii requires culture in mammalian cell lines. When necessary, specimens can be sent to specialized or reference laboratories for appropriate procedures. Culture of certain agents of bacterial pneumonia poses major health risks to laboratory workers (e.g., F. tularensis, Bacillus anthracis, C. burnetii). Specimens suspected to harbor one of these agents should be dealt with carefully in a biologic safety hood, and isolation of the pathogens should be reserved for specialized laboratories.",

Diagnosis usually requires that a convalescent specimen demonstrate a fourfold increase in immunoglobulin (Ig) G titer above that present in an acute specimen. These tests are not helpful in initial patient management but are of utility in defining the epidemiology of the pertinent infectious agents.

Outpatient treatment is recommended for patients with a PSI score of 70 or less (class I or II). Patients with a PSI score of 71 to 90 (class III) may benefit from brief hospitalization, while inpatient care is appropriate for patients with a score greater than 90 (class IV and V). Prospective studies in both community and teaching hospitals demonstrate that the hospital admission decisions based on PSI may be safely and effectively applied in clinical practice.

Polymerase chain reaction technology holds promise for aiding diagnosis, especially of group A streptococcal infections 150 and S. milleri empyema. 149 concentration (MIC) of penicillin less than or equal to 2 \u00b5g/mL and high-level resistance as MIC greater than or equal to 8 \u00b5g/mL markedly changed the incidence of penicillin resistance. 135 This redefinition was driven by discordance between the previous lower MIC breakpoints and clinical success rates. The rate of increase in the frequency of penicillin resistance may have stabilized, possibly as a consequence of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and a shift in the outpatient antibiotic prescription patterns away from \u03b2-lactams. 136 Penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae is due to alterations in penicillin-binding proteins rather than to \u03b2-lactamase production. Unlike other \u03b2-lactams, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and cefepime retain activity against 75% to 95% of nonmeningeal isolates of S. pneumoniae. 137 S. pneumoniae resistance rates to other antimicrobials can be as high as 30% for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), 16% for tetracyclines, 26% for macrolides, and 9% for clindamycin; these rates are higher among penicillin-resistant pneumococci. 134, 136 High-level macrolide resistance (MIC > 64 \u00b5g/mL) associated with the MLSB (macrolide, lincosamide, streptogramin B) phenotype is more common in Europe 138 and has been associated with in vitro resistance to clindamycin. 139 S. pneumoniae resistance to fluoroquinolones has also emerged with associated clinical treatment failures. 113, 136 Recent exposure to an antibiotic increases the likelihood of the patient having a pneumococcal isolate resistant to that antibiotic (or class of antibiotics). Thus, it is important to avoid antibiotics that have been used in the prior 90 days when selecting a regimen for empirical treatment of a pneumococcal infection. 113 Retrospective and prospective observational studies have suggested a benefit to treating severely ill patients with proven pneumococcal infections with both a \u03b2-lactam and a macrolide. 76, 140, 141 Explanations that have been proposed to explain those results include nonbactericidal effects, such as inhibiting biofilm production, or an anti-inflammatory effect of the macrolide.",

Although one large study in Spain found that 7% of CAP was due to P. aeruginosa, most studies have found substantially lower rates. 24, 111 One major risk factor for Pseudomonas CAP is structural lung disease, such as cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and severe COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second <30%). Another risk factor is HIV infection, especially with a marked deficiency of CD4 + T cells. [174] [175] [176] Pseudomonas pneumonia in AIDS patients can be severe, with mortality rates as high as 50%, and be associated with cavitation, even when the patient has a profound CD4 + T-cell deficiency.

Current recommendations for inhalational anthrax call for initial treatment with ciprofloxacin plus one or two additional antibiotics with in vitro activity, such as clindamycin, vancomycin, imipenem, meropenem, chloramphenicol, penicillin, ampicillin, rifampin, and clarithromycin. 205 If the isolate is susceptible, therapy can be changed from the fluoroquinolone to high-dose penicillin G or doxycycline. Intravenous therapy may be converted to oral therapy once the patient's condition stabilizes. Since pulmonary and systemic anthrax are associated with high mortality rates, therapy with an FDA-approved humanized monoclonal antibody (Raxibacumab) to anthrax lethal toxin is recommended as an adjunct to antimicrobial therapy. 51a Treatment for 60 days is recommended, to eliminate spores that could be the source of relapse.

After a known aerosol exposure to F. tularensis, prophylaxis with doxycycline or ciprofloxacin for 14 days is recommended. 52 PLAGUE (YERSINIA PESTIS) (see Chapter 40) Plague is typically associated with ground squirrels, rabbits, prairie dogs, rats, and other small ground animals. Rodent fleas are responsible for transmission of the organism between animal hosts. Humans become infected when bitten by an infected rodent flea, by handling an infected animal carcass, or by inhaling an aerosol from a human or animal with pulmonary involvement. In the United States, most cases of plague are in rural New Mexico, Arizona, and California. 46 Because of the disease severity and potential for aerosol transmission, Y. pestis is also regarded as a potential bioterrorism weapon. 207 Three clinical forms of infection exist: pneumonic, bubonic, and septicemic. Although the pneumonic form presents as a primary pneumonia, the lung may also be involved in bubonic and septicemic infections. Plague pneumonia may develop 2 to 7 days after the initial exposure. Early in the course of the illness, patients experience fever and toxicity, followed by chest pain, productive cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. The presence of hemoptysis can cause confusion with the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, whose geographic distribution overlaps with plague in the United States. If pulmonary disease complicates bubonic plague, painful adenopathy is also noted. In the septicemic form, the patient may show only signs of septic shock. Chest radiographs in cases of pneumonic plague commonly reveal bilateral lower lobe alveolar opacities, but there may also be nodules, adenopathy, and pleural effusions.",

Microaerophilic streptococci and viridans streptococci are also frequently isolated and can contribute to treatment failure if appropriate antibiotics are not included. 228 Lung abscess may also be associated with pyogenic bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and parasites such as Paragonimus, Entamoeba, and Echinococcus (see Chapter 39) . Secondary lung abscesses develop from congenital lung abnormalities, obstructing neoplasms, foreign bodies, and bronchiectasis. Lung abscess may also complicate pulmonary infarction, primary lung cancer (central carcinoma with necrosis), metastatic malignancies, and the necrotic conglomerate lesions of silicosis and coal miners' pneumoconiosis. Lesions in diseases such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly termed Wegener granulomatosis) and rheumatoid arthritis with rheumatoid nodules may also mimic lung abscess. metastases with necrosis and/or hemorrhage. Groundglass opacities consistent with interstitial pneumonia suggest P. jirovecii pneumonia. Nodules or multiple masses with or without cavitation are compatible with Nocardia species, M. tuberculosis, or Q fever. Diffuse or mixed interstitial and alveolar opacities may be due to viral infections or M. pneumoniae. Other imaging studies, such as chest CT pulmonary angiography should be considered to evaluate the possibility of pulmonary emboli.",

Immunodeficiency may arise as a complication of cancer chemotherapy, immunosuppressive agents, or corticosteroid use; or it may result from a congenital (e.g., agammaglobulinemia) or acquired (e.g., HIV infection) immune defect. Many of these immune deficiencies are not remediable; however, drug-related immunosuppression may be improved by discontinuing the offending agent or reducing the dose. Although reduction of immunosuppression may promote recovery from the active infection, it can also be complicated by enhanced inflammation due to immune reconstitution. 219, 220 Granulocytopenia (absolute granulocyte count less than 500 cells/mm 3 ) has been associated with fulminant, antibiotic-unresponsive pneumonia, and administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is effective in increasing the number of circulating neutrophils. Despite this effect on neutrophils, routine administration of G-CSF or GM-CSF has not been found to improve survival from infections. 221 Because pneumonia is the infection most frequently associated with a poor clinical outcome in profoundly neutropenic patients, the use of G-CSF or GM-CSF in these patients may be justified, even though a benefit has not been demonstrated. 222 Corticosteroid treatment has been investigated because of its suppressant effect on inflammatory responses; studies have yielded discordant findings. A recent meta-analysis found evidence for a positive effect on survival in severe cases of CAP. 223 In contrast, a recent randomized trial showed no benefit, although the number of patients with severe CAP may have been insufficient to reveal a difference in this select group. 224",

While annual influenza vaccination is widely recommended, the immunogenicity and efficacy of the currently available vaccine is lower in individuals older than 65 years of age, and breakthrough infections are frequent. 232 Two pneumococcal vaccines are currently available. The purified polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) contains capsular antigens isolated from 23 of the most prevalent capsule types and is immunogenic in adults, although antibody levels decrease to prevaccination levels after 4 to 7 years. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) contains the polysaccharide antigens from 13 of the most prevalent capsule types, conjugated to a nontoxic mutant of diphtheria toxin protein, which generates T-cell help and long lived memory B cells specific for the pneumococcal antigens. PPSV23 should be administered to all individuals 65 years of age and older, as well as those 19 to 64 years of age with chronic conditions that increase the risk of invasive pneumococcal infection (e.g., diabetes mellitus, chronic lung, heart, or liver disease; cigarette smoking or alcoholism). Patients aged 19 years and older with immunodeficiencies or other conditions that impose an especially high risk of invasive pneumococcal infection (asplenia, HIV or other congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies, myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia, chronic renal failure) should receive an initial dose of PCV13 followed 8 weeks or longer later by PPSV23. eTable 33-9 lists the conditions and indications for which administration of each of the pneumococcal vaccines is currently recommended. 233 In 2014, the updated ACIP recommendations are that both PCV13 and PPSV23 should be administered in series to all adults 65 years of age and older. A dose of PCV13 should be received first followed by a dose of PPSV23 6 to 12 months later.
