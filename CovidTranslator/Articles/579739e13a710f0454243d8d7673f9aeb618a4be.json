In the presented study, a double-sandwich ELISA (pH1N1 ELISA), based on two monoclonal antibodies against haemagglutinin (HA) of the pH1N1 virus, was developed. After laboratory determination of the sensitivity and specificity characteristics, the performance of this assay was evaluated in a cohort of 904 patients with influenza-like illness. All seven strains of pH1N1 virus tested were positive by pH1N1 ELISA, with an average lower detection limit of 10 3.0 \u00b1 0.4 tissue culture infective dose (TCID) 50 /mL (or 0.009 \u00b1 0.005 HA titre). Cross-reaction of the assay with seasonal influenza virus and other common respiratory pathogens was rare. In pH1N1-infected patients, the sensitivity of the pH1N1 ELISA was 92.3% (84/91, 95% CI 84.8-96.9%), which is significantly higher than that of the BD Directigen EZ Flu A + B test (70.3%, p <0.01). The specificity of pH1N1 ELISA in seasonal influenza A patients was 100.0% (171/171, 95% CI 97.9-100.0%), similar to that in non-influenza A patients (640/642, 99.7%, 95% CI 98.9-100.0%). The positive predictive value for pH1N1 ELISA was 97.7% and the negative predictive value was 99.1% in this study population with a pH1N1 prevalence of 10.1%. In conclusion, detection of HA of pH1N1 virus by immunoassay appears to be a convenient and reliable method for the differential diagnosis of pH1N1 from other respiratory pathogens, including seasonal influenza virus.",

The spread of the virus highlights the importance of having convenient and reliable methods for diagnosis. Currently, RT-PCR is the mainstay for specific diagnosis of pH1N1 virus infection in the clinic, but its utility is questionable, because of the requirement for specialized equipment and long turn-around time. Hence, rapid influenza diagnosis tests (RIDTs) have been used on many occasions [2] . However, RIDTs cannot efficiently differentiate pH1N1 virus infection from seasonal influenza A virus infection, as they have poor sensitivity [2] [3] [4] [5] , with consequences for clinical management. Therefore, a sensitive and convenient immunoassay that can differentiate the pH1N1 virus from seasonal influenza virus is desirable. In this study, with haemagglutinin (HA) of pH1N1 virus as the detection target, a double-sandwich ELISA (pH1N1 ELISA) was developed and evaluated for its ability to differentiate pH1N1 virus from other respiratory pathogens, including seasonal influenza viruses.",

For detection by pH1N1 ELISA, 50 lL of viral lysis buffer was added to the coated wells, and a 100-lL specimen aliquot was then added and mixed. After incubation for 60 min at 37\u00b0C, the plate was washed five times with a washing buffer. Then, 100 lL of 1E12-horseradish peroxidase solution was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. After five washes, 100 lL of tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min, and the optical density (OD) 450/630 nm was measured with a microplate reader (Sunrise, Tecan, Switzerland) (Fig. 1) . The final result was obtainable within 105 min. The cut-off value was set as mean + 4 standard deviations, equal to 2.1-fold of the mean value of two negative control wells or 0.105 if the mean negati value was <0.05. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasopharyngeal aspirate/nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), nasal swab/nasal wash, throat wash, oropharyngeal swab, cell culture supernatant and allantoic fluid specimens were available for the test without any pretreatment. However, the swab specimens need to be transported in viral transport medium (phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 100 U/mL kanamycin and 120 U/mL ampicillin) before testing.",

After a 2-month summer vacation ending at the end of August, a pH1N1 outbreak in Xian occurred in a university, such that, by 4 September, over 50 students were hospitalized. As the pandemic progressed, 920 patients reported fever, cough or other symptoms of ILI for the period from 24 to 27 September at Xijing Hospital (Xian, China). Given these circumstances, permission to conduct a laboratory-based study was obtained from the institutional review board of Xijing Hospital. From this cohort, 904 (98.3%), patients were recruited into the study. NPS specimens from these patients were carefully collected by using sterile polyester, according to a standard method [8] , and were transported to the microbiology laboratory in 1.5 mL of viral transport medium. The time of sampling was <48 h post-onset for each patient.",

The subtypes of influenza A virus were determined by DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. For the sequencing analysis, a 281-nucleotide fragment (nucleotides 84-370 in the NP gene of influenza A virus) was obtained by nested PCR. The first round of PCR was performed with an outer primer set of NPF1 (5\u00a2-AGC AAA AGC AGG GTA GAT AA-3\u00a2) and PyR533 (5\u00a2-AGT GTT GAA CCT TGC ATT AGA GAG-3\u00a2) for 30 cycles.

The high sensitivity of the assay may be attributed to the high affinity of the mAbs used and/or enzyme-induced signal amplification. The assay also showed excellent specificity among seasonal influenza A patients (100%, 95% CI 96.4-100%) as well as among non-influenza A patients (99.7%, 95% CI 98.9-99.9%). Because of the low prevalence of seasonal H1 virus during the study period (0.6%, 95% CI 0.2-1.3%), only five seasonal H1-positive specimens were tested (all were negative). However, 78 strains of influenza A viral cultures (including 23 strains of H1N1 of human origin) and 20 strains of influenza B viral cultures were tested, with negative results being obtained by the assay even at much higher titres (over 1000-fold higher than the lower detection limit of the assay). This strongly suggests the assay does not cross-react with other influenza viruses (Table 3) . Interestingly, a strain of A/H1N9 (A/WDK/Shantou/520/2000) virus of bird origin tested positive at a titre of over 16 HA (approximately 1800-fold higher than the lower detection limit of the assay), and this may indicate a potential association between the former and pH1N1 virus.",

Regarding antiviral therapy, pH1N1 virus is sensitive to oseltamivir but seasonal influenza virus is usually resistant [15] . This argues for rapid diagnosis as part of the assessment of patients with ILI who present to the clinic. An accurate diagnosis will result in better medical care [16] . Accurate diagnosis of pH1N1 virus infection depends on several aspects: (i) quality of the specimen-nasopharyngeal specimens are more appropriate for detection (nasopharyngeal aspirate or NPS), especially for antigen testing [17, 18] ; (ii) the time when the specimen was collected in relation to the onset of symptoms-a previous study showed that the decrease in viral concentration was correlated with time elapsed from symptom onset [19] ; and (iii) the sensitivity and specificity of the tests used-previous studies demonstrated that most of the current RIDTs had sensitivities ranging from 11% to 88% [2, 20] , although they were very convenient for one-step operation. Hence, specimens that are negative by RIDT should undergo further testing with more sensitive assays. RT-PCR is the most sensitive method for the diagnosis of pH1N1 virus infection. However, it is expensive and timeconsuming. In an influenza pandemic, laboratories may have to process a large number of specimens in a short period (e.g. over 200 specimens per day in this study). In this study, even with the use of a high-throughput automation workstation (96 channels) for RNA extraction and PCR, detection of 200 specimens by RT-PCR would take a minimum of 6 h. Thus, a reliable ELISA for the detection pH1N1 virus infection will enhance the effectiveness of disease control in the following ways: (i) it has a shorter turn-around time; (ii) it has lower costs, making it practicable for developing countries; and (iii) it can be a suitable tool for surveillance in a large population.",
