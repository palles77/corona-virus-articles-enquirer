Viral nucleocapsid proteins are inevitable for genome encapsidation and replication. Here we demonstrate the interaction between the N protein of HCoV-229E and cyclophilin A, not cyclophilin B. Cyclophilin inhibitors abolish this interaction. Upon infection, cyclophilin A stays evenly distributed throughout the cell, whereas cyclophilin B concentrates at ER-bleb-like structures. We further show the inhibitory potential of non-immunosuppressive CsA derivatives Alisporivir, NIM811, compound 3 on HCoV-229E-GFP and -Luciferase replication in human Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells at 18 and 48 h time points post infection with EC 50 s at low micromolar ranges. Thus, non-immunosuppressive CsA derivatives effectively inhibit HCoV-229E replication suggesting them as possible candidates for the treatment of HCoV infection. The interruption of interaction between CypA and N protein by CsA and its derivatives suggest a mechanism how CypA inhibitors suppress viral replication.",

In that study we had identified cyclophilins and FK506-binding (FKBPs) proteins as cellular interaction partners of the viral Nsp1 protein and the cyclophilin-binding immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) as a replication inhibitor of the various human and animal CoVs including SARS-CoV, NL63, 229E and Feline CoV, Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus, Infectious Bronchitis Virus, respectively. In a follow-up study we found that non-immunosuppressive CsA derivatives Alisporivir (ALV), NIM811 and further compounds inhibit replication of NL63 and that CypA is an essential cellular molecule required for virus replication (Carbajo-Lozoya et al., 2014) .

In addition, the coincidental binding of the CsA/CypA complex causes immunosuppression, i.e. it prevents activation of the transcriptional regulator Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT) . Inhibition of the PPIase activity not only prevents correct folding of cellular, but also of a number of viral proteins indispensable for viral replication. This was shown first for Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Hopkins and Gallay, 2015; Lin and Gallay, 2013) .

Following the minor affinity for CypA this substitution abrogates the immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties of CsA (de Paulis et al., 1996; LeGrue et al., 1986 ). Fig. 1C shows a slight residual inhibitory activity of the CsH preparation, which might be a result of the low CypA affinity or of traces of CsA-like impurities present in the CsH preparation. Due to the chemical similarity (stereoisomers) of these molecules, the impurities are very difficult to remove from the product batches. We also observed a very low inhibition of CypA in the PPIase assay with this compound. The immunosuppressive drug rapamycin was used as a further, cyclophilin-independent control molecule to test the effect of immunosuppressants on CoV replication. It binds to FKBP1A (=FKBP12), but as opposed to FK506 it interferes with the mTOR (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) pathway by inhibiting a serine/threonine protein kinase (Huang et al., 2003) . Fig. 1B shows background inhibitory activity of rapamycin. Thus, lack of effective inhibition of viral replication by CsH, which does not affect the PPIAse activities of cyclophilins strongly, argues for the requirement of this function for coronavirus replication.",

Its primary function is to encapsidate and protect genomic RNA. Lack of N protein is thus a measure of lacking viral replication. To study the effect of CsA, ALV, NIM-811 and compound 3 on viral N protein expression Huh-7.5 cells were incubated with concentrations of 0-20 \u03bcM of the respective inhibitors for 48 h. Western blot analysis of 229E-infected Huh7.5 cells was performed utilizing an anti-N antibody. Fig. 2 demonstrates the decrease of the N protein between 1.25 \u03bcM and 5 \u03bcM in the presence of ALV, NIM811 compound 3. In case of ALV N protein is not detectable anymore at 1.25 \u03bcM. Similarly, presence of the positive control CsA also decreases N protein expression between 1.25 and 5 \u03bcM whereas CsH and rapamycin allow significant N protein synthesis even at 20 \u03bcM. It is not clear whether the inhibitors act on cyclophilin binding to the N protein itself, on other viral proteins or both. However, viral N protein, essential for replication, is not synthesized in the presence of the inhibitors.",

It is based on the splitting of YFP into N (YFP N )-and C (YFP C )-terminal halves which are fused at the DNA level to two proteins to be tested for interaction. Upon interaction of the two proteins, the two YFP fragments assemble to functional YFP, which is demonstrated by fluorescence.

So far, the inhibitory effect on HCoV-229E replication cannot exclusively be attributed to only one or to both cyclophilins. We reasoned that a possible co-localization of the cyclophilins with a marker of viral replication at the site of replication might give hints on the relevance of the two proteins. Therefore, we visualized the effect of both inhibitors on the intracellular localization of CypA/B and dsRNA by immunofluorescence assays in presence and absence of virus. Expression levels of CypA were similar, and it was distributed throughout cytoplasm and nucleus of Huh7 cells irrespective of the conditions (Fig. 4 , \"anti-CypA column\"). In contrast, CypB located in untreated cells (no inhibitors and no virus) almost exclusively to the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 , \"ETOH/mock\" and \"ETOH/ HCoV-229E\" panels). From earlier work, it is known that CsA alters CypB trafficking through the secretory pathway (Price et al., 1994) . Here we found that CypB Inhibitor treatment causes its re-localization and sequestration to foci in the nucleus and a strong reduction of expression (Fig. 5 , right panel: small green dots in CsA/ALV mock-and 229E-infected cells). Most interestingly, virus infection in cells not treated with inhibitors caused the shift of CypB localization from an even cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 5 , \"ETOH/mock\" row) to large bleblike structures around the nucleus (Fig. 5 \"ETOH/HCoV-229E\u2033 row and Fig. 6 left \"anti-CypB\" column). The intense yellow co-staining of these structures with anti-PDI and anti-CypB antibodies indicates co-localization of the two proteins. Due to the intense concentration, we refer to virus-induced CypB/ER blebs. Staining with antibodies against other cell organelles (cis-Golgi, autophagosomes, P-bodies, stress granules) did not reveal co-localization with CypB (Fig. 6 ). Viral dsRNA did colocalize neither with CypA (Fig. 4 , \"ETOH/HCoV-229E\u2033 row) nor with CypB/ER blebs (Fig. 5 , \"ETOH/HCoV-229E\u2033 row). These blebs were not observed in infected and CsA/ALV-treated cells as the inhibitors prevent virus replication. Western blot analysis clearly demonstrated down-regulation of CypB but not of CypA in the presence of inhibitors independent of virus infection in Huh7 cells (Fig. 7) . ",

Here we demonstrate the inhibition of HCoV-229E by the same compounds as well as their influence of the CypA-229E-N protein interaction.

            "text": "In general, CoV inhibition requires low micromolar ranges of CsA and its non-immunosuppressive derivatives, which was recently found by us (Carbajo-Lozoya et al., 2014; Pfefferle et al., 2011) and by others (de Wilde et al., 2011) . Interestingly, inhibition of HCV with ALV and CsA/NIM811 is commonly observed at low nanomolar and low micromolar concentrations, respectively, unraveling ALV as the most effective compound. Currently, we cannot explain why the Cyp inhibitors (especially ALV) are much more potent in preventing HCV as opposed to CoV replication, or why their inhibitory activity on CoVs is rather similar. One explanation might be that several CoV proteins depend on the activity of CypA and/or CypA might have higher affinities to coronaviral as compared to HCV proteins thus requiring higher inhibitor doses to abolish interactions. We used CsH and rapamycin as control compounds. Both allow the transfer of NFAT to the nucleus (not shown). CsH displays only a very weak binding affinity to cyclophilins. Thus, no CsH/CypA complexes exist that can bind to and inactivate Calcineurin (CaN). Rapamycin targets FKBPs similarly to the immunosuppressant FK506. In an earlier report we had described 229E inhibition by the FKBP-binding drug FK506 (Carbajo-Lozoya et al., 2012) . However, the rapamycin/FKBP complexes inhibit the unrelated m-TOR pathway in contrast to FK506/FKBP complexes which bind similar to the CsA/Cyp complexes to CaN thus hampering the CaN phosphatase activity and as a consequence the NFAT pathway. Both drugs do not inhibit 229E replication. The minor reduction observed in the case of CsH might be attributed to a very weak binding affinity to cyclophilins or to traces of CsA, from which CsH was synthesized and which can only be separated quantitatively by enormous experimental expenditure. Expression analysis of the 229E N protein further supports the inhibitory effect of the different substances. N is required for virus replication and thus essential for the viral life cycle. Western blot analysis (Fig. 2) demonstrates the lack of N protein expression during 229E-LUC infection of Huh-7.5 cells at ALV, NIM811, Compound 3 and CsA inhibitor concentrations above 1.25 \u03bcM and 5 \u03bcM, respectively, but Fig. 4 . Immunostaining of CypA in mock-and HCoV-229Ewt-infected Huh7 cells in the presence of ETOH solvent or cyclophilin inhibitors CsA and Alisporivir. After infection (MOI = 1) medium was removed and new medium was added to cells containing 20 \u03bcM of inhibitor for 48 h and samples were processed for IF. CypA and dsRNA were stained with anti-CypA (green, ab3563, Abcam, 1:500) and anti-dsRNA J2 (red, Scicons, 1:1500), respectively. Nuclei were visualized with DAPI. Nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of CypA was not affected by the presence of virus or cyclophilin inhibitors. dsRNA as replication marker was not detected in the presence of CsA or ALV. Exposure times for the respective antibodies were the same in the different samples.",

However, in both siRNA knockdowns residual expression of CypA or CypB proteins might have left enough PPIase activity levels in the infected cells to support viral replication. The role of CypB during CoV replication is not clear as we show that its protein level and subcellular localization completely changes in the presence of CsA and ALV. Divergent results are reported in a recent study which found no difference in HCoV-229E replication in Huh7wt as compared to Huh7-CypA KO (knockout) pool cells and to two Huh7-CypA KO clones (de Wilde et al., 2018) . MERS-CoV titers were moderately diminished (3fold), whereas equine arteritis virus was reduced by \u223c3 logs. These cell lines had been generated by CRISPR/Cas9-technology and it was obviously very difficult to generate clear-cut CypA KO s in the Huh7 hepatoma cells as chromosomal translocations, carrying PPIA sequences were observed. Only two heterogeneous clones #1 and #2 carrying eight and six PPIA-specific insertion/deletions (indels), respectively, could be isolated. The clones were identified to be CypA-negative by Western blot with an antibody directed against a short peptide sequence at the C-terminus of CypA. However, this region is located within exon 5 and it cannot be excluded that frameshifts occurred upstream of the antibody-recognized peptide sequence within exon 5, which was not sequenced. Interestingly, it was not possible to generate Huh7-CypB KO , Huh7-CypC KO , and Huh7-CypD KO cell clones. 5 .

The binding of CypA to the SARS-CoV N protein is known from a very early educated guess finding using surface plasmon resonance biosensor technology (Luo et al., 2004) . This was supported by a spectrometric profiling study showing the incorporation of CypA into SARS-CoV virions (Neuman et al., 2008) . Here we show for the first time the direct interaction between CypA and HCoV-229E 'N' protein and 'X' (ADRP) proteins by split YFP assay (Fig. 3) . Most interestingly, only the CypA-'N' but not the CypA-'X' interaction is blocked by CsA and non-immunosuppressive derivatives ALV and NIM811 indicating the importance of CypA for correct folding of 'N'during replication. Mechanistically, we suggest that CoV inhibition is a direct consequence of interruption of the interaction between N capsid protein and CypA by cyclophilin inhibitors. It further remains to be determined what the function of Nsp1 and 'N\u2032 binding to CypA is and whether other Fig. 6 . Co-immunostaining of CypB and cell organelles in HCoV-229E-infected Huh7 cells.

Cyclophilin B normally distributes within the ER. In the presence of HCoV-229E, it intriguingly concentrates at bleb-like structures of the ER. From our own and other laboratories results it is clear that nonimmunosuppressive CsA derivatives block CoV replication. Furthermore, ALV and NIM811, which have already been tested in human phase II (ALV, NIM811), as well as the new CsA position 1modified compounds (not tested in humans) are promising, broadlyacting candidate HTAs for anti-coronaviral therapy. According to our results, CypA represents an important player during CoV replication. For final resolution of the requirement of different Cyps for CoV replication, further efforts have to be put on the construction of stable Cyp knockouts in different CoV-infectable cell lines and on the involvement of different viral proteins.",

After infection (MOI = 1) medium was removed and new medium was added to cells containing 20 \u03bcM of inhibitor for 48 h and samples were processed for IF. CypB and dsRNA were stained with anti-CypB (green) and anti-dsRNA J2 (red, Scicons, 1:1500), respectively. Nuclei were visualized with DAPI. CypB shifts from an even cytoplasmic distribution to intense bleb-like structures in the presence of virus (white arrows, ETOH solvent panels). CsA and ALV led to the re-localization of CypB to granular structures in the nucleus and to a massive reduction of expression independent of virus infection. dsRNA as replication marker was not detected in the presence of CsA or ALV. Exposure times for the respective antibodies were the same in the different samples.",
