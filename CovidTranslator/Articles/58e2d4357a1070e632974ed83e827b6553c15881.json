            "text": "Sequence information on the genome of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has only recently been determined. In contrast, very little is known about the viral proteins. In the present report we have identified the membrane glycoprotein (M) of PEDV by use of rabbit anti-peptide sera and transient expression of the cloned M gene in Vero cells and by expression in the baculovirus system. The native M protein of PEDV is incorporated into virions, is N-glycosylated, and migrates with a relative mobility (Mr) of 27 k in polyacrylamide gels. In contrast, the M protein synthesized by recombinant baculoviruses migrates with a Mr of 23 k, that is, with identical mobility as the deglycosylated product of PEDV. Thus, it appears that M protein specified by the recombinant baculovirus is poorly, if at all, glycosylated. Using monoclonal antibodies and rabbit antipeptide sera specific for the N and C termini of the M protein, we were able to show that a 19 k band detected in PEDV-infected cells but not in virions represented a fragment of M from which the C terminus had been cleaved off. Finally, by electron microscopy and immunogold labelling, the relative orientation of M within the virion envelope was determined as NexoCcyt. In conclusion, all of these data strongly support the hypothesis that PEDV should be classified with the group I coronaviruses.",

            "text": "It has been suggested that the immune reaction to the membrane (M) protein of coronaviruses may play an important role in the induction of protection (7) and in mediating the course of the disease (8) . Furthermore, the M proteins of these viruses provide an interesting opportunity for studying the taxonomic position of coronaviruses because of a number of unifying and distinguishing features of the amino acid sequences themselves and of their cotranslational and posttranslational processing. According to the literature (9, 10) , M protein is largely buried within the virus membrane with an extraviral NH2 terminus and an intraviral COOH tail, thus adopting a NexoCcyt orientation. The typical M protein has a molecular weight of 17-30 kD, it spans the membrane three times, and its extraviral domain may carry O-linked oligosaccharides, as do some members of antigenic group II coronaviruses, for example, human coronavirus OC43 (HCVOC43) (11) , bovine coronavirus (BCV), and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (10) . Alternatively, the extraviral domain may be N-glycosylated, as has been suggested for most coronaviruses of antigenic group I, for example, HCV229E (12) and TGEV (13) . According to the published sequences (4), a schematic representation of the typical domains of the putative PEDV membrane protein is depicted in Fig. ld . Notably, three potential N-glycosylation sites (shown by asterisks; only one of which is actually expected to be functional) and three transmembrane (TM) regions (shaded) have been anticipated. The fourth hydrophobic domain (hatched) is not predicted to have a helical structure. It thus probably represents a membrane-associated domain rather than an additional membrane-spanning segment. In contrast to TGEV, no putative signal sequence has been predicted for the membrane protein of PEDV.",

Replicate samples of mock-infected lysates (lanes 1 and 3) and PEDV-infected lysates (lanes 2 and 4) were immunoprecipitated with either monoclonal antibody 204 (lanes 1 and 2) or immune rabbit serum R34, which was specific for the C terminus of the PEDV M protein. The samples were electrophoresed in polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and exposed to autoradiography. B: PEDV-infected and mock-infected cells were metabolically labeled with ~4C-glucosamine as described in Materials and Methods. One fraction of each of the samples was ultracentrifuged as described for the preparation of virions before polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose (lane 1, mock infected; lane 2, PEDV infected). The remaining fractions were lysed in RIP buffer and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody 204 (lane 3, mock infected; lane 4, PEDV infected) before electrophoresis and western transfer. The nitrocellulose was exposed to a phosphor screen for 5 days before being scanned with a phosphorimager. The arrow on the right points to a glycoprotein band of Mr 27 k that was precipitated by monoclonal antibody 204. Open arrows point to viral glycoproteins detected in PEDV virion preparations.",

Figure 6 shows that the outside of coronavirus-like virions were stained by the gold-labeled antibodies provided that they had been incubated with monoclonal antibody 204 (A) or the N-terminal peptide serum (B). The preparations are shown. Purified PED virions were prepared as described in Materials and Methods, and were divided into two equal portions. One of the portions was solubilized directly in NaDodSO4 buffer, whereas the remaining fraction was mixed with water supplemented with Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 0.1%. The sample containing Triton was kept for 15 min on ice before NaDodSO4 was added. Equal amounts of the Triton treated (lanes 2, 5, 8) and untreated (lanes l, 4, 7) samples were loaded, separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose.

This finding clearly implied that PEDV should not be grouped with the coronaviruses of antigenic group II, which are, for unknown reasons, predominantly Oglycosylated (10) . Interestingly, M of PEDV appeared to be poorly if at all glycosylated when expressed by a recombinant baculovirus. Poor glycosylation of coronavirus (21) and influenza virus (22) glycoproteins by the baculovirus expression system has also been observed by others. In order to be glycosylated, the M protein has to be integrated in the ER. In the absence of a cleavable signal sequence, this may be achieved through each one of the three membrane-spanning domains common to all of the M proteins of coronaviruses (I0). Thus, provided that the construct inserted into the recombinant baculovirus did not contain undetected sequence errors, it may be concluded that the Sf9 insect cells did not accept the signal provided by the putative transmembrane domains of PEDV M protein. It should be very interesting to address this question in the future by the expression of M in other eukaryotic vector systems such as recombinant vaccinia or herpes viruses.",

According to the lack of a predicted signal sequence, it could be expected that the M protein of PEDV does not undergo N-terminal proteolytic cleavage as do the M proteins of TGEV (19) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (7) . In infected cells, however, we observed an approximately 19 kD fragment of M that was not incorporated into virions. The fragment could be reconstituted from virions following incubation with Triton X-100. The frag-ment reacted with a rabbit anti-peptide serum specific for the N terminus of M and with monoclonal antibody 204 but not with the C-terminal antiserum. This N-terminal fragment represented approximately two thirds of the M protein. We hypothesize for this reason that incubation with the detergent made a protease cleavage site accessible to the enzyme and the cytoplasmic tail of M was cleaved off. Others have postulated that the cytoplasmic fraction of M mediates interaction with the nucleocapsid protein and is required for particle formation (10) . This may explain the fact that the 19 kD band was not incorporated into the virions.",

Vero cells and St9 cells were infected or mock infected as described in Materials and Methods. The samples, treated as indicated for each lane separately, were electrophoresed in polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose before being immune stained with monoclonal antibody 204 and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit-anti-mouse lgG. The immune reaction was visualized by the incubation of the nitrocellulose sheet in a substrate containing chloronapthol and peroxide. A: Purified PED virions (lane 1). Lysates of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus (PAK-BM-4; lane 2) and wild type baculovirus (PAK 6; lane 3), respectively. B: Untreated (lane 1) and N-glycosidase F treated (lane 2) purified PED virions and lysates of PEDV-infected (lanes 5,8-11) and mock-infected Veto cells (lanes 4 and 7). The cell cultures used for the preparation of samples in lanes 7-1 t had been incubated in the presence of tunicamycin. Lanes 7 and 8 were incubated with 210 ng tunicamycin/ml, lane 9 with 60 ng tunicamycin/ml, lane 10 with 20 ng tunicamycin/ml, and lane I I with 7 ng tunicamycin/ml. A molecular weight marker was run in lanes 3 and 6.k double band were stained faintly, and at least two faster migrating bands of Mr 8 k and I0 k were apparent. Although this lane had been loaded with high amounts of protein, absolutely no traces of the 19 k band could be visualized (asterisk). Both antipeptide sera also immune stained an intermediate band ofMr 14 (open  arrow), which was almost not recognized by the monoclonal antibody. In conclusion, these observations indicate that the 19 k band represented an N-terminal fragment of the M protein from which a C-terminal piece had been cleaved off. Furthermore, the epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody 204 could be mapped to the N-terminal fragment of M. Because the C terminus of M is possibly involved in protein-protein interaction with N and is required for assembly of virions, it is conceivable that such a truncated form of M protein is not incorporated into virions.",

            "text": "In this article a gene product of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has been conclusively identified for the first time. The salient features of our observations are as follows: (a) The membrane protein M of PEDV migrated with a relative mobility (Mr) of 27 k in polyacrylamide gels. Several faster migrating bands of M represented predominantly cleavage and degradation products. These observations are in good agreement with the apparent molecular weights reported for M of other coronaviruses (10) . According to the predicted amino acid sequences, the M proteins specified by Transmissible Gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCV229E) are most closely related to that of PEDV (4). Specifically, 119 identical amino acids (aa) are shared between M of TGEV and M of PEDV. For TGEV, an Mr of 27.8 k has been calculated for the unglycosylated form of M (19) . In contrast, the M protein of HCV229E shares 129 identical aa with M of PEDV (20) . A relative mobility of 19 k has been described for the in vitro translated M protein of HCV229E (12), whereas we report that the deglycosylated and unglycosylated forms of M of PEDV migrated with an Mr of 23 k. The differences of the relative mobilities between M of PEDV (226 aa) and M of HCV229E (225 aa), on the one hand, and M of TGEV (262 aa), on the other hand, may be explained by the absence of the signal sequences in the M proteins of PEDV and HCV229E. Although 104 aa are identical between TGEV and HCV229E, only 80 aa are corn-",
