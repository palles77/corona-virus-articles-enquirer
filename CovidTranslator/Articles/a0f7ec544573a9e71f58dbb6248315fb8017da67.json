            "text": "The integumentary system is composed of skin and associated adnexa. Basic elements of the integument are similar across all mammalian species, but a few important, species-specific differences are worth highlighting when evaluated from a surgical perspective. For example, rather than hair, the hedgehog has spines, which must be plucked like bird feathers during presurgical preparation. Some species, such as chinchillas and sugar gliders, have very thin skin, especially in the inguinal or scrotal region; therefore, caution should be implemented when clipping and prepping this area to avoid iatrogenic trauma. On the other hand, the skin associated with the dorsal cervical region of ferrets can be thick and tough, whereas the abdominal skin of ferrets, in particular those with adrenal adenoma/adenocarcinoma, may be very thin. In some small rodent species, in particular hamsters, there is an abundant epidermis and dermis with significant elasticity, which can be of benefit when surgically closing an area with a significant tissue deficit. The skin of Guinea pigs, however, tends to be much less elastic, making it more difficult to close large surgical wounds. Common integumentary surgical procedures in small mammals include trauma (wound closure), epithelial or subcutaneous mass removal, and surgical d\u00e9 bridement/excision of abscesses. Additionally, cheek pouch prolapse and diseases associated with scent glands are occasionally observed in hamsters. ",

            "text": "Trauma is common in small mammals and is associated with intraspecific or interspecific bite wounds (Fig. 2) , being dropped by a human caretaker, wounds from cage material or cage ornaments, self-mutilation, or other accidental injuries when an animal has free access to their house environment. 7, 8 Bite wounds from cage mates are commonly observed in rodents (see Fig. 2 ) and occasionally observed in ferrets. Interspecific bite wounds, especially from cats, frequently lead to fatal septicemia if not treated rapidly and thoroughly. Most traumatized small mammals should be evaluated for hemorrhage and blood loss and signs of infection and the body should be thoroughly examined for less obvious, hidden wounds. Severe hemorrhage resulting from trauma, such as lacerations of major vessels, hematomas, or internal organ damage, is frequently life threatening in small mammals, so immediate hemostasis and supportive care are critical. Sedation or anesthesia is typically necessary for small mammals that need to be evaluated after a traumatic incident. Generally, the hair associated with the skin lesion must be clipped to properly evaluate the wound. Once the hair is clipped, some wounds require suturing, whereas other wounds may heal over time by second intention with intensive bandage changes and wound d\u00e9 bridement. Warm disinfectant solutions (eg, dilute povidone iodine or chlorhexidine) and/or saline may be necessary for cleaning large wounds to avoid heat loss. Appropriate use of analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and antimicrobial drugs should be considered during treatment of traumatic wounds. The basic tenets of small animal (ie, dog and cat) wound management and secondary infection control can be applied to small mammals, except that choice of antimicrobials is based on safety for the species, in addition to microbial culture and sensitivity. Generally, most wounds heal by second intention if secondary infection is controlled, and surgical intervention is only required with open wounds with wide skin margin deflection or with very recent wounds with clean, underlying tissues. As an illustration of excellent second intention wound healing, a ferret was evaluated by one of the authors (YM) for significant inguinal skin sloughing secondary to urolith urethral obstruction and subsequent bacterial infection (Fig. 3) . In this case, the wounds resolved over time using wet-todry bandages, antimicrobials based on bacterial culture and sensitivity, antiinflammatories, and analgesics.",

            "text": "Abscesses are commonly observed as superficial lumps or masses, especially in rats, guinea pigs and other rodent species. Abscesses in small rodents are most commonly the result of bite wounds from cage mates. 9 Subcutaneous abscesses in rats are common and must be distinguished from mammary adenomas (Fig. 4) . Initially, differentiating between a soft tissue mass and abscess is important through use of a fineneedle aspirate (FNA) and cytologic examination. Confirmed abscesses are typically obvious once the needle is inserted and purulent material is expressed from the needle insertion site. There are cases of neoplastic lesions, however, with purulent, necrotic cores that can be misdiagnosed as a pure abscess. With abscesses, collecting a sample for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity is an important next step. Managing abscesses can occur using 2 methods. First the animal must be sedated or anesthetized and the hair associated with the abscess clipped and the site aseptically prepared. One approach is to lance the abscess using a scalpel blade (#11 or #15); drain the purulent material; irrigate the abscess using warm, sterile saline, dilute chlorhexidine, or povidone iodine; and leave the incision open to heal by second intention. Administering appropriate antimicrobials is normal standard of practice in these cases. This approach to abscess management is usually curative in ferrets, sugar gliders, and hedgehogs. In other rodents (eg, Guinea pigs, chinchillas, hamsters, rats, and mice), however, recurrence is common if the abscess is not fully excised, without rupturing the capsule, because the abscess capsule remains a constant nidus of infection (Fig. 5) . 9 Therefore, in rodents, the clinician should always consider surgical excision of the abscess, using an elliptical incision around the abscess and treating it is though it was a soft tissue mass. The skin can be closed using either suture material or staples but with awareness that many rodents, without placement of an Elizabethan-collar (E-collar), vigorously attempt to chew and scratch at their incision. Staples can help slow down the process of having a determined rodent open the surgical wound, and proper E-collar placement prevents access to the surgical site.",

Generally, surgical intervention is not necessary for mild to moderate lesions, and medical therapy includes the following approach: (1) soaking lesions with dilute chlorhexidine or povidone iodine solutions; (2) applying antimicrobial ointments/creams (eg, silver sulfadiazine) with overlying bandages and regular, repeated bandage changes (see Fig. 6 ); (3) maintaining the animals on soft substrates; and (4) administering appropriate antimicrobials, anti-inflammatories and analgesics. In severe cases of pododermatitis, particularly with radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis, surgical d\u00e9 bridement and/or amputation of the affected limb may be necessary. With limb amputation of small mammals, it is usually best to amputate the entire limb, otherwise trauma to the remaining limb stump is a chronic, recurrent medical issue. Limb amputation in small mammals is identical to procedures described in dogs and cats, with an extra focus on hemostasis, analgesia, and warmth. Remarkably, rodents adjust rapidly to loss of a limb, except some Guinea pigs have a difficult time holding their body off the ground with 3 limbs, especially with loss of a forelimb. This can result in dragging of the body and trauma to the ventrum, so this must be considered prior to amputating Guinea pig forelimbs.",

Although understanding of behavioral mechanisms underlying this condition in sugar gliders is limited, hypotheses include, boredom, lack of appropriate conspecific social or sexual interactions, owner neglect, inappropriate environment and husbandry, and death or recent separation of cage mates. 10 Excessive chewing and self-mutilation of the Fig. 6 . Severe pododermatitis in a guinea pig. Lesions (A) are treated by soaking with dilute chlorhexidine or povidone iodine, applying silver sulfadiazine cream, and bandages (B) that are replaced once to twice weekly depending on how clean and dry the bandages are maintained. Appropriate oral antibiotics based on bacterial culture and antibiotic sensitivity, and anti-inflammatory drugs are administered. Bandaging with only elastic adhesive tape is difficult to keep clean, so latex or nitrile glove finger parts or duct tape are used to cover the outside of the bandage to keep clean and dry (B). These lesions were resolved within approximately 2 months by second intention healing (C, D). perineal-cloacal region may be caused by pericloacal gland impaction/infection or penile prolapse. 10 In cases of tissue necrosis or severe tissue destruction, surgical repair is frequently necessary (Fig. 8) , but most mild to moderate self-mutilation wounds heal by second intention along with appropriate antimicrobial and antiinflammatory administration. When the penis is affected, amputation may be necessary (Fig. 9) . Sugar gliders have a biforcated penis and urinate from the penile base, so amputation at the forked end of the penis does not interfere with urination (see Fig. 9 ). Early castration of sugar glider males is often recommended because sexual frustration may be a factor associated with self-mutilation (discussed later). In most cases, initial treatment involves hair clipping, disinfection of wounds with dilute povidone iodine or chlorhexidine, the use of antimicrobials and analgesics, and correction of the underlying causes, such as improper socialization, husbandry, nutrition, and so forth. Modified E-collars or Velcro (Velcro Industries, Manchester, NH, USA) and fleece straightjackets are usually necessary to prevent further mutilation during treatment (Fig. 10) . It is important not to remove the E-collar or straightjacket too soon in the healing process; typically, the authors maintain the protective E-collar/jacket for a minimum of 2 weeks after the wound has completely healed and keep the animal in the hospital to watch for recurrence of self-mutilation for 3 to 6 hours after removing the E-collar/jacket. If this process is not properly maintained and monitored, recurrence of self-mutilation can be so severe that euthanasia or death of the sugar glider is the outcome.",

Rather than grasping the tail, the individual should be manually restrained over the dorsal cervical region and the rest of the body supported with the other hand. In cases of tail skin degloving, surgical amputation of the remaining degloved tail is recommended. 9,11,12 Amputation Fig. 8 . Severe self-mutilation in a sugar glider. Most sugar glider self-mutilation wounds are small so that surgical intervention is not necessary, but large wounds require surgical intervention. is performed just proximal to the remaining skin margin. The hair associated with the amputation site is clipped, the distal tail is wrapped with aseptic gauze, and the amputation site aseptically prepared for surgery. A tourniquet placed at the very base of the tail aids with perioperative hemostasis. The procedure is nearly identical to that used for dog tail amputation. Once the site is prepped and draped, a local anesthetic, such as lidocaine, is administered around the planned skin incision site. A double V-shaped skin incision is made on right and left lateral aspects of the tail, just distal to the desired intervertebral transection site. Orient the double V-shaped incision to create dorsal and ventral skin flaps that are longer than the desired tail length; start the incision just distal to the desired intervertebral space. Bipolar cautery is useful for hemostatsis, and is critical in such a small working space. Muscles and subcutaneous tissue are bluntly dissected from the vertebrae caudal to the intervertebral transection site using small hemostats, and the distal tail is disarticulated with a scalpel blade (#11 or #15) by incising through the desired intervertebral space. Prior to closure, release the tourniquet at the base of the tail and observe the surgical site for hemorrhage. Use bipolar cautery if necessary to control remaining hemorrhage. Using 5-0 absorbable, monofilament suture material, appose subcutaneous tissues and muscles over the exposed vertebra with a simple continuous suture pattern. To close the skin layer, use 4-0 or 5-0 nonabsorbable, monofilament suture material in a simple continuous or simple interrupted pattern, making sure that there is enough skin to provide good apposition without tension. To protect the surgical site, it is best to place a light, pressure bandage over the incision and maintain the bandage in place for 24 to 48 hours. An E-collar may be necessary to prevent damage to the surgical site.",

            "text": "A variety of skin and subcuticular neoplasms have been reported in small mammal species. [13] [14] [15] [16] Based on the authors' experiences, skin and subcuticular neoplasms are common in hedgehogs, rats, ferrets, and hamsters and less common in guinea pigs and mice. Although integumentary neoplasms are uncommon in sugar gliders, with the exception of mammary gland tumors (Fig. 12) , as sugar glider husbandry improves and captive age increases, it is likely that there will be an increased incidence of integumentary tumors. Of particular importance with respect to integumentary neoplasm incidence, squamous cell carcinomas are common in hedgehogs, 13 benign neoplasms of basal cell origin are the most common in ferrets, 13 and atypical fibromas are the most common in Djungarian (ie, dwarf) hamsters. 15 Djungarian hamsters show a high prevalence of neoplastic disease (5 times greater than Syrian hamsters), and most tumors are integumentary. 15 Neoplastic diseases are rare in chinchillas. 16 Mammary gland tumors, most commonly adenomas, are the most common subcutaneous tumor in rats and mice, 13, 14 and the distribution of mammary tissue is extensive so the tumors can occur anywhere from head and neck to perineal region in both males and females (Fig. 13) . 13 Diagnostic and surgical approaches with small mammal integumentary tumors are similar to those of dogs and cats; however, consideration of self-trauma is important after FNA of masses in some rodent species and sugar gliders. Additionally, hematoma-like lesions are occasionally observed in Djungarian hamsters, and appear as a flaccid, superficial mass (Fig. 14) . These lesions can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage after FNA, so aspiration should be stopped immediately when blood is aspirated, and surgical removal of the lesion should be considered. The treatment of choice for integumentary tumors is complete surgical excision with histopathologic evaluation. Once the patient is prepped and draped, a scalpel blade or cautery device can be used to make an elliptical incision around the mass, or in cases of rat mammary masses, the incision is commonly made directly over the mass. Generally, little to no hemorrhage is observed if using a bipolar cautery forceps to incise the skin. Using a cautery device requires great caution to prevent ignition with oxygen used simultaneously during anesthesia. Additionally, application of other hemostatic aids, such as LigaSure (Covidien Surgical Solutions, Dublin, Ireland) laparoscopic instruments, contributes to reduction of operative time and minimizes hemorrhage. Making the elliptical incision to include appropriate surgical margins is important in any species, although large surgical margins may make closure more difficult due to the tension created during closure of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. When large epithelial defects are expected, the extent of the incisional line should be decided based on the anticipated skin tension and location of subdermal vascular plexus to avoid circulatory compromise after wound closure. These considerations are especially important for guinea pigs, because their skin is thick and less elastic compared with other rodent species, and Guinea pig integumentary tissues tend to develop a significant inflammatory reaction to excessive suture materials and skin tension compared with other small mammal species. Therefore, surgical wounds may be more likely to either dehisce or develop abscessation with tension or excessive suture material. For any small mammal species, such skin tension can be relieved by undermining skin adjacent to the surgical wound through blunt dissection, with care to preserve the subdermal plexus and direct cutaneous vessels that run parallel to the skin surface. If these methods do not allow primary skin apposition, the remaining surgical wound may be allowed to heal by second intention, or reconstructive surgical procedures, using skin flaps or grafts, can be completed with approaches as those used in dogs and cats. For rat mammary tumors, once the incision is made directly over the mass, the subcutaneous tissues can be undermined and bluntly dissected away from the mass using hemostats. Mammary masses in rats are well vascularized, so be careful not to incise the mass. Most typically, the mass can be freed from the subcutaneous layers, and the primary vascular supply can be for at the deep base of the mass. Ligatures or Hemoclips (WECK Hemoclip Plus, Teleflex Medical, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) can be used to clamp the vessels supplying the tumor and the mass can be removed. Once any integumentary mass is removed from a small mammal, routine closure techniques are similar to those used in dogs and cats, closing the subcutaneous tissues with 3-0 to 5-0, monofilament, absorbable suture materials, and 3-0 to 4-0 monofilament, nonabsorbable suture material for closing the skin layer. Alternatively, skin staples may help in those species most likely to chew their incision, and are easy to apply and faster to apply than sutures. In Guinea pigs, skin staples can reduce the amount of foreign suture material, which is inflammatory in this species. Rat mammary tumors are likely to recur, so this should be part of the client communication.",

            "text": "Male and female Guinea pigs have an equal prevalence of mammary gland tumors, unlike most other species. 13, 16 Guinea pigs have 2 mammary glands located just cranial to the inguinal region. Affected mammary glands expand in a solid or cystic manner and often secrete fluid, which has a plasma-like appearance. In these cases of mammary tumors, unilateral mammary resection is most common, because the right and left mammary glands are not physically associated with each other. It can be difficult to remove the entire mass or masses with clean margins, and postsurgical dehiscence is common. Resection of large masses requires deep subcutaneous sutures to minimize dead space and to limit incisional tension. Cheek pouch eversion in hamsters Many small mammal species have cheek pouches, which may be located internally within the caudal oral cavity, and may be large and expansile for storing food, or externally in some rodent species. Cheek pouch eversion is occasionally observed in hamsters, especially Djungarian hamsters. 9 Causes of hamster cheek pouch eversion include inflammation associated with a food item or foreign material, and microbial infection or abscessation. Clinically, the prolapsed cheek pouch is visibly hanging outside of the oral cavity and may appear swollen, erythematous, and edematous, with necrosis associated with prolonged cheek pouch tissue prolapse (Fig. 15 ). In acute cases, without severe edema or necrosis, management includes sedation, removal of food or foreign materials from the pouch, and replacement to its normal anatomic conformation using moistened cotton-tipped applicators. If there is concern about reproplapsing, a single, full-thickness, percutaneous mattress suture, using 4-0 or 5-0 monofilament, nonabsorbable suture material can be placed into and through the cheek pouch. In this case, the suture can remain in place for several days to 1 week, at which time the suture should be removed. If the prolapsed cheek pouch is moderately to severely edematous, 50% dextrose solution can be applied directly to the tissue, with the hope that the sugar solution will contribute to tissue contraction, allowing the cheek pouch to be replaced with moistened cotton-tipped applicators. If the prolapsed cheek pouch is severely inflamed or discolored or the mucosal tissue appears necrotic, the necrotic tissue should be surgically excised (see Fig. 15 ). Two stay sutures, using 4-0 or 5-0 monofilament, absorbable material can be placed proximal to the planned incision line. The tissue can be transected, circumferentially, just proximal to the necrotic tissue, and the excised tissue placed in buffered formalin for histopathologic analysis and a second piece used for bacterial culture if necessary. Care should be taken if placing hemostats or using forceps for firm manipulation of prolapsed cheek pouch tissue, because this can cause additional damage to remaining healthy tissue. The incision can be sutured using 5-0 or 6-0 monofilament, nonabsorbable suture material in a simple continuous pattern. Have bipolar or unipolar cautery instruments ready in anticipation of hemorrhage. Postoperatively, it is important to counsel the owner about avoiding food (eg, cooked pasta or rice) and bedding (eg, Kleenex) materials that are likely to adhere to the suture line and contribute to further problems. Additionally, the owner should be instructed to withhold the normal diet, and, instead, syringe-feed a fine-grind feeding formula for 3 to 5 days, and to remove all bedding materials that the patient may attempt to pack into the pouch, which can result in incisional dehiscence. 9 Appropriate antimicrobials and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are administered for 5 to 7 days, postoperatively.",

            "text": "Gastrointestinal foreign bodies are occasionally observed in ferrets but are less common in rodents, hedgehogs, and sugar gliders. In a case of one of the authors (YM), an enterolith in a chinchilla was treated by, but this is rare. In ferrets, foreign bodies are most commonly ingested objects from the environment, but there are cases of trichobezoars in ferrets as well. Ingested foreign bodies tend to occur most commonly in younger ferrets, because they are inquisitive and like to chew on various objects, in particular rubber or sponge products (Fig. 16) . [17] [18] [19] In contrast, trichobezoars tend to occur in older ferrets. 17 In cases of trichobezoars, there is usually 1 hairball, which is a comma-shaped, but sometimes 2 or multiple hairballs are found in the stomach and/or small intestine. The clinical presentation of ferrets with partially or completely obstructive foreign bodies includes regurgitation, anorexia, dehydration, lethargy, and melena. Diagnosis of gastrointestinal foreign bodies is based on history, physical examination, and imaging using radiography, CT, or ultrasound. Careful palpation of the ferret abdomen is important, because many gastrointestinal foreign bodies are palpable, and palpation commonly elicits a painful response, such as rapid hunching or vocalization. Abnormal radiographic abdominal findings include segmental ileus, gaseous distention of the stomach, and, occasionally, a visible foreign body. Gastrointestinal contrast studies can be conducted and may be useful in determining the location of the foreign body. Only 30% of foreign bodies, however, were detectable in a study evaluating contrast radiography in ferrets. 19 Supportive care and stabilization of debilitated ferrets with fluid therapy, analgesics, and proton pump inhibitors (eg, omeprazole) or H 2 -receptor antagonists (eg, famotidine or ranitidine) may be useful to prevent gastritis and enteritis during anorectic perioperative period. Gastrointestinal foreign bodies can be removed surgically or by endoscopy. Small foreign materials in the stomach can be removed using a flexible endoscope of appropriate diameter, but larger foreign materials, and most trichobezoars, need surgical intervention. An advantage to using a surgical approach is that concurrent diseases associated with other abdominal organs, such as the pancreas, liver, intestines, and adrenal glands, can also be grossly evaluated during the procedure. Surgical procedures are similar to those of dogs and cats, except the authors avoid using hemostats to manipulate tissues, thereby avoiding iatrogenic trauma of delicate small mammal stomachs and/or intestines (Fig. 17) . Once the location within the gastrointestinal tract is determined, a midline abdominal incision is made, which should be closely associated with the site of the lesion. The organ (stomach or small intestine) involved can be manipulated into the incision and 2 stay sutures can be placed in the serosal surface. Once the lesion, foreign body, or biopsy site is isolated outside of the abdomen, gauze moistened with sterile saline can be used to pack off the abdomen to prevent gastrointestinal content leakage. The stomach or intestine can be incised, biopsied, or resected and anastomosed using identical techniques in dogs and cats. Once the mass, foreign body, or biopsy tissue has been removed, single enterotomy or gastrotomy incisions should be closed in 2 layers, using 4-0 to 6-0 monofilament, absorbable suture material in an inverting pattern (eg, Cushing-Connell or Cushing-Lambert). Anastomoses can be closed in 2 layers, using 4-0 to 6-0 monofilament, absorbable suture material in an inverting pattern as well. The muscle layer is closed using 3-0 to 4-0 monofilament, absorbable suture material in a simple continuous pattern. The skin can be closed using an absorbable suture material in a subcuticular pattern or a nonabsorbable suture material for placing simple interrupted sutures. Skin staples are an alternative and are particularly useful if a clinician is aware that the patient chews at its incision site postsurgery. In most cases, recovery is rapid after gastrointestinal foreign body removal, and ferrets are able to eat soft foods within one or 2 days after surgery.",

Complete surgical excision of the abscess with capsule is the most effective, but it is occasionally difficult due to development of significant tissue adhesions. In these cases, incise the capsule of abscess and remove as much purulent material as possible and irrigate with dilute antimicrobial solutions, followed by resection of as much of the abscess capsule as possible. The abscess capsule should be submitted for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture and cytology, and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered until receiving the bacterial culture and sensitivity results. Intra-abdominal granulomas are occasionally observed in ferrets. 18, 19 Treatment includes complete or partial excision or biopsies of the granuloma, followed by submission for cytology, histopathology, and or bacterial and fungal culture. In the authors' experiences, most intra-abdominal granulomas in ferrets are associated coronavirus or mycobacterial infection. In ferrets infected with coronavirus, granulomas are commonly found at the mesenteric lymph node (Fig. 18 ) but can also be disseminated in multiple organ systems (see Fig. 18 ).",

            "text": "Although rectal prolapses can be observed in many small mammal species (Fig. 19) , the incidence is greatest in ferrets and hamsters. 9, [17] [18] [19] Young ferrets with chronic diarrhea are especially prone to rectal prolapses, which are generally superficial and typically resolve with treatment of the underlying cause of diarrhea. Prolapses in hamsters are also common but tend to be more severe and may include the rectum and large and small intestines. Additionally, in hamsters, intestinal prolapse can be accompanied by intestinal intussusception. Treatment of rectal prolapses in small mammals depends on severity and integrity of exposed tissues. In ferrets, treatment generally includes sedation or anesthesia, lubrication, and gentle replacement of the prolapsed tissue using cotton-tipped applicators, followed by placement of 2 transanal sutures using 3-0 to 4-0 nonabsorbable, monofilament suture material (Fig. 20) , making sure that the animal is able to defecate normally. If the prolapsed lesion is severely edematous, 50% dextrose or Preparation H (Pfizer, Inc., Kings Mountain, NC, USA) can be applied to the prolapsed tissues prior to attempted replacement, as discussed previously. The underlying cause of the diarrhea must be addressed immediately as well, and the sutures can remain in place for 3 to 7 days. In cases of multiple rectal prolapse recurrence after addressing the underlying condition, a colopexy can be performed (Fig. 21) . If the rectal mucosa is significantly and chronically everted and no longer reducible, the prolapsed tissue can be resected and the rectum sutured to the anus (Fig. 22) . This procedure, however, may cause permanent anal sphincter atony. In hamsters, rectal prolapses tend to be more significant than those of ferrets (see Fig. 19 ) and include tissues proximal to the rectum, with some cases accompanied by intestinal intussusception (Fig. 23) . Tissue discoloration and necrosis begin within several hours of the prolapsed tissue, and the affected hamster may be systemically compromised and require intensive supportive care along with urgent surgical repair. With necrosis, the tissue must be excised and the viable tissues anastomosed using 5-0 to 7-0 monofilament, absorbable suture material. An exploratory celiotomy is usually indicated if an intestinal intussusception is diagnosed, although the prognosis for these cases is poor. A routine, ventral midline abdominal celiotomy is performed, and the intussusception identified. Resection and anastomosis of the intestine is the typical approach, although there is evidence that if the intestinal tissues are viable, the intussusception can be reduced manually. With resection and anastomosis, use 5-0 to 6-0 monofilament, absorbable suture material to suture the proximal and distal ends of the intestine as in dogs and cats.",

Surgery of the extrahepatic biliary system is uncommon, but one of the authors (YM) has surgically managed several cases of extrahepatic biliary system obstruction in ferrets (Fig. 24) . Surgical procedures associated with the liver are common in ferrets (Figs. 25 and 26 ) and prairie dogs, primarily for biopsies or tumor excision, and less common in rodent species. Clinical signs associated with hepatic disorders are typically nonspecific until the disease process has advanced, and this may exacerbate the risk of anesthesia, because there may be impaired drug metabolism and excretion and prolonged duration of action of anesthetic drugs. These risks are more profound when injectable agents are administered, so a thorough presurgical evaluation of blood parameters and imaging techniques is imperative if severe hepatic dysfunction is suspected. Therefore, inhalational anesthetic agents are preferred for maintaining anesthesia in patients undergoing hepatic surgery, because isoflurane and sevoflurane have not been associated with postoperative hepatic dysfunction. 20 Hypoalbuminemia, or albumin levels less than 2.0 g/dL, may contribute to delayed wound healing and decreased synthesis of clotting factors may contribute to coagulopathies. 20 In these patients, preoperative blood transfusions and vitamin K should be considered.",

The guillotine method is adequate for sampling the outer margin of the liver, whereas a skin punch biopsy is ideal for collecting a sample from a local lesion within the central portions of the liver. As with liver biopsies in dogs and cats, at least 2 to 3 samples should be obtained from separate liver lobes, including both peripheral and central locations as well as grossly normal and abnormal-appearing tissue. 21 This approach may be difficult to impossible, however, for smaller species. Therefore, the authors recommend obtaining 1 to 2 samples, attempting to include both grossly normal and abnormal-appearing tissue.

Surgical conditions of the spleen include laceration, torsion, neoplasia (primary and metastatic), and hematoma. For small mammals, however, splenic diseases, especially neoplastic masses, are primarily observed in ferrets. Generalized splenomegaly is common in ferrets, and many clinicians, wrongfully, decide to collect an FNA or biopsy only to receive a diagnosis of extramedullary hematopoiesis. 18, 22 In most ferrets with generalized splenomegaly, biopsy and surgery are not indicated, except with severe splenic enlargement that interferes with abdominal visceral function or a ferret's activity (Fig. 28) . Other causes of ferret splenic enlargement, such as cardiomyopathy, Aleutian disease, and eosinophilic gastritis, have been reported. 22 Additionally, isoflurane anesthesia causes splenic sequestration of red blood cells and the reduction of hematocrit by up to 35% in ferrets. 23 Thus, ferrets with splenomegaly should always be evaluated for underlying disease conditions, and splenectomy should only be considered with ultrasonographic or CT evidence of splenic surface or parenchymal irregularities. The most common indications for considering a splenectomy include, neoplastic diseases (primary or metastatic), and traumatic laceration of the splenic capsule in ferrets. In ferrets, lymphoma is the most common primary splenic neoplastic disease, and hemangiosarcoma, mast cell tumor, and liposarcoma are occasionally observed as primary splenic neoplasia. Metastatic diseases are most commonly associated with adrenal neoplasia or pancreatic beta cell tumors (ie, insulinoma). Laceration of the splenic capsule is a possible sequela to abdominal trauma or hematoma, and many affected ferrets require a blood transfusion (Fig. 29) . Two primary surgical techniques are used for splenic surgery: partial splenectomy and total splenectomy. Total splenectomy is the most common, an easier procedure to perform, whereas partial splenectomy is rarely indicated. The surgical procedure in ferrets is identical to that performed in dogs and cats. 22 A vascular sealing instrument, such as a LigaSure device, is useful and contributes to a reduction in the surgical time. Because the spleen is a major site of erythropoiesis in ferrets, the consequences associated with a total splenectomy to a patient should be carefully considered prior to undertaking the surgery. 22 Fig. 28 .

The urinary bladder is incised approximately along the ventral midline from cranial to caudal and the uroliths removed. Some uroliths are adhered to the urinary bladder mucosa, and care must be taken to peel them from the bladder wall, because hemorrhage is common.

In most rodent species, especially Guinea pigs and chinchillas, the inguinal canal is large diameter, and the testicles move freely from the abdominal cavity into the scrotum. 7 This open inguinal canal is important with respect to the chosen procedure for orchiectomy. There are 2 primary surgical approaches to castrating rodents: bilateral scrotal incisions, with open or closed castration, or a single, prescrotal incision, in which both testicles are excised from the same incision with either an open or closed procedure. 7 The prescrotal approach can be more efficient with 1 less incision, but care must be taken with hedgehogs, chinchillas, and Guinea pigs because the penis is comparatively large and frequently directly in the surgical field. Although many clinicians profess one procedure better than the other, the authors have performed many open and closed orchiectomies through 1 or 2 incisions and have not observed significant complications from any of the chosen surgical procedures. Once the patient is anesthetized and surgically prepared, bupivacaine (2 mg/kg) or lidocaine (4 mg/kg) with 50% of the total dose administered directly into each testicle as a local nerve block (Fig. 34) . Either bilateral cranial scrotal (Fig. 35) or single, prescrotal incisions are made. The general procedure is similar as that used in dogs. Whether using an open or closed technique, it is important to leave as much nontesticular tissue in the distal inguinal canal (eg, the vaginal tunic and epididymal fat pad) to prevent herniation of abdominal organs into the inguinal canal. Application of Hemoclips for ligating vessels can decrease surgical time compared with tying ligatures. Once the testicles are removed, it may be beneficial to use a sterile cotton-tipped applicator to place remaining tissues back into the inguinal canal. In cases in which the tissues are difficult to push cranially into the inguinal canal, it may be helpful for an assistant to hold the tissues within the canal and place a deep subcutaneous suture line to close the canal and prevent further herniation into the scrotum. Minimize quantity of suture material in Guinea pigs, however, due to potential for inflammation and abscessation. The prescrotal or scrotal skin incisions can be closed using a subcuticular pattern (3-0 or 4-0 absorbable, monofilament suture material), nonabsorbable skin sutures or skin staples.",

The most effective and efficient surgical approach, with the least likelihood for postsurgical self-mutilation by the patient, is by use of a CO 2 laser (Fig. 36) . 27 The scrotal stalk is shaved and aseptically prepared and bupivacaine (2 mg/kg) or lidocaine (4 mg/kg) with 50% of the total dose administered directly into each testicle. Frequently, the size of the testicle limits the volume of local anesthetic instilled in each testicle; for example, it is difficult to administer much more than 0.2 mL in a typical rat testicle or 0.05 mL in a sugar glider testicle. A tongue depressor is placed between the glider's body and the scrotal stalk, and the laser is applied to the stalk cutting rapidly in transverse section, close to the body wall, so as not to leave excess tissue. The laser cuts and cauterizes instantly (see Fig. 36 ). One consequence of using the CO 2 laser is that the skin of the sugar glider skin appears to puff up during laser application, and this can be alarming to a first time user. Also, be careful with a cavalier approach to laser application, because significant, collateral tissue damage may be a consequence. In the authors' experience, there is no postsurgical self-mutilation of the surgical site after use of the laser, whereas self-mutilation is common if using a traditional, scalpel-based surgical approach with sutures.",

            "text": "As discussed previously, elective ovariectomy and ovariohysterectomy surgical procedures used in small mammals are similar to those used in dogs and cats, with a few notable exceptions. A flank approach to ovariectomies in rodents is, currently, more commonly used than 5 years ago. 7 Laparoscopic ovariectomies are commonly performed in academic veterinary hospitals on dogs and cats, but this approach is not used routinely in small mammals. Other differences include varies and uteri are smaller and tend to be more friable in small mammals, especially rodents, compared with dog and cat tissues. Two surgical approaches are used for ovariectomies and ovariohyterectomies in rodents, ferrets, and hedgehogs. 7 Elective ovariectomy or ovariohysterectomy of sugar gliders is uncommon due to the significant likelihood of postsurgical self-mutilation. The traditional, ventral midline approach to ovariectomy/ovariohysterectomy is identical to the same approach in dogs and cats, although tissues in small mammals are smaller and more friable. In addition, female Guinea pigs have less elastic ovarian suspensory ligaments, which makes ovarian visualization and exposure much more difficult. Application of Hemoclips or use of a LigaSure device can be useful for ligating vessels and hemostasis, because suture ligatures are time consuming and may be difficult in species in which the ovaries are not easily exposed. The uterus can be clamped and ligated at the level of the cervix in most species. The alternative surgical approach for elective ovariectomy is through flank incisions. 7 The primary advantages of this approach include, a shorter procedure, less visceral organ manipulation, faster recovery time, and less postsurgical pain. It is easiest to make 2 flank incisions, 1 in each flank region. The primary disadvantage is lack of access to the uterus, which is most problematic if the surgical procedure is conducted because of pathology. The skin incisions are made, one at a time, in the paralumbar region, from the last rib to the lateral processes of the lumbar vertebrae. The muscle layer is incised and the tissues bluntly dissected. Bipolar cautery can be used for hemostasis. The ovary can be gently manipulated and exposed and a hemostat placed across the ovarian vessels. Hemoclips or suture ligatures can be applied to the ovarian pedicle and the ovary excised. A standard, 2-layer closure of the muscle layer and skin can be performed using suture material and/or staples for the skin layer. The opposite ovary is approached in the same manner.",

            "text": "For nonelective reproductive tract procedures, the primary reproductive diseases associated with ferrets, rodents, and hedgehogs includes Guinea pig ovarian cysts and caesarian sections, pyometra, or mucometra in various species. Ovarian cysts are commonly observed in female Guinea pigs and frequently require surgical intervention. [27] [28] [29] [30] Typical clinical signs include bilaterally symmetric and nonpruritic alopecia and abdominal distention associated with enlarging ovarian cysts (Fig. 37) . Diagnosis is suspected based on typical clinical signs and palpation and confirmed using abdominal ultrasonography or CT. As discussed previously, normal ovaries of guinea pigs have short ovarian ligaments and tend to be located in a more dorsal position compared with rabbits, which can make access to the ovaries more difficult when a ventral midline incision is used. Therefore, some surgeons prefer a dorsal flank approach to the Guinea pigs ovaries. 7 On the other hand, the ovarian cysts are frequently large and easily manipulated through a ventral midline incision, and both authors typically use this approach for ovarian cysts (Fig. 38) . Once the incision is made, be careful with excessive manipulation of other abdominal organs, especially the gastrointestinal organs, because Guinea pigs tend to have a more dramatic inflammatory reaction to organ manipulation that other small mammal species. It is best to protect the other abdominal organs with moist gauze and minimize traction of the uterus and ovaries. In cases in which the ovarian ligaments are flaccid and stretched by the enlarged ovaries, providing good access to the ovarian pedicle, monofilament, absorbable suture material can be used to place ligatures (Fig. 39) , or a LigaSure device can be used to ligate the ovarian vessels. For those cases in which the ovarian ligaments are not elastic and extraction of ovaries is difficult, Hemoclips can be useful for ligating the ovarian vessels. A bilateral ovariohysterectomy is most commonly used by the authors, but when only 1 ovary is cystic and approaching the other side via a ventral midline incision is difficult, a unilateral ovariectomy may be elected.",

Because the ovaries of Guinea pigs can be difficult to access through a midline incision, discussed previously, one of the authors (YM) surgically removes uterine or vaginal lesions and leaves the ovaries intact if there is no concurrent ovarian pathology. Large vaginal masses are sometimes observed in female Guinea pigs and may appear unresectable based on ultrasound or exploratory laparotomy results. From the authors' experiences, however, these masses are easy to remove due to minimal adhesions, despite the size of the mass. In such cases, a ventral midline approach is used and the ovaries and uterus are surgically removed. The vagina is incised, the mass is peeled away from the mucosa, and bipolar cautery is used for hemostasis. The vagina can be closed using 3-0 to 4-0 monofilament, absorbable suture in a 2-layer inverting pattern, and the muscle layer and skin closed as previously described.",

Uterine masses are commonly diagnosed in middle-aged and older (greater than 2 years) hedgehogs and present with hematuria, and hemorrhagic discharge from vulva (Fig. 41) . With sedation or anesthesia, uterine masses are usually palpable in the caudal abdomen and can be confirmed using CT or ultrasonography. Ovariohysterectomy is usually curative if the tumor is contained within the uterus. The hedgehog is placed in dorsal recumbency, and an approximate 2-cm midline incision is made from the umbilicus caudally. The swollen, discolored uterus is detected and is lifted through the incision with Babcock forceps (Fig. 42) . The uterine horns are coiled and broad ligament of the uterus is narrower and tighter than in rabbits, for example (see Fig. 42 ). Some ovarian and mesometrial vessels are visible, but they tend to be small and hemorrhage is seldom a problem if using Hemoclips or a LigaSure device. In some of these cases, however, there can be excessive hemorrhage, and perioperative or postoperative death is possible due to blood loss. The uterus can be transfixed using 3-0 or 4-0 monofilament, absorbable suture material, and transected at the cervix or vagina. The muscle layer is closed using 4-0 monofilament, absorbable suture material in a simple continuous patter, and a subcuticular pattern can be used to close the skin or skin sutures or staples used.",

Reproductive system neoplastic diseases were most common in the 1970s and 1980s or second only to lymphoma. [32] [33] [34] The prevalence of reproductive system tumors has significantly decreased, however, whereas the prevalence of endocrine neoplasia, including adrenal adenoma/adenocarcinoma and pancreatic beta cell tumors (ie, insulinoma), has increased. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] This changing prevalence of neoplastic diseases in ferrets can be attributed to the fact that most pet ferrets sold in North America and Japan are neutered and descented at an early age. Both authors have performed multiple ovariohysterectomies and anal sacculectomies on retired breeding ferrets (Fig. 43) . The ovariohysterectomy procedure in a ferret is identical to that in a small cat. Both authors have experienced cases in which stump pyometra is diagnosed, and surgical excision of the distended uterine stump was completed. Castration of male ferrets is similar to the procedure used in a small dog (see Fig. 35 ). Although uncommon, mammary gland neoplasia is observed in ferrets and is most commonly associated with concurrent adrenal disease and increased reproductive hormones. In cases of mild enlargement of mammary gland or enlargement of the nipples only (Fig. 44) , these symptoms may resolves with surgical removal of the diseased adrenal gland or medical management by using deslorelin implants. On the other hand, in cases in which a solid mammary tumor is observed, the diseased mammary tissue should be surgically excised (see Fig. 44 ).",

This medical management does not affect the disease progression, only the signs associated with increased androgens and estrogens. Surgical removal of the adrenal gland is an option, and can provide increased time to recurrence. Typical clinical signs associated with adrenal disease in ferrets include alopecia, pruritus, skin excoriations, lethargy, swollen vulva in females, stranguria in males due to prostatic enlargement and urethral compression, and thin skin. Diagnosis is based on endocrine panels and/or ultrasonographic evidence of an enlarged or misshapen adrenal gland or glands. The adrenal glands are located near the craniomedial pole of the kidneys and surrounded by large amount of fat within the retroperitoneal cavity. The right adrenal, like the kidney, is located more cranially and closely associated with the dorsomedial aspect of the caudal vena cava. Therefore, surgical removal of the right adrenal gland is technically more challenging than surgical removal of the left adrenal gland. The surgical approach to the abdomen is routinely performed via a ventral midline approach and the retraction of the spleen and intestines from the surgical field to visualize the adrenal glands. Although both adrenals are located within the retroperitoneal fat (Fig. 45) , the affected adrenal gland(s) is enlarged, irregularly shaped, discolored, and readily visible (Fig. 46) . Although 1 gland may have an abnormal appearance on ultrasound images, both adrenal glands may be affected, and a subtotal, bilateral adrenalectomy is warranted. The authors usually attempt to remove the affected adrenal gland and debulk the other, leaving some of the capsule behind. The authors have not observed any ferret developing long-term hypoadrenocorticism crisis postbilateral adrenalectomy, but immediate postsurgical treatment with corticosteroids may be beneficial. 39 Accessory adrenal glands are occasionally observed and these tissues may compensate after the bilateral adrenalectomy in ferrets. The procedures associated with left adrenectomy (Fig. 47) and right adrenalectomy (Fig. 48) in ferrets are shown. Use of a CO 2 laser (Fig. 49) and cryosurgical probes has been described for right-sided The spleen and small intestines are retracted toward the right side in the body or exteriorized through the incision line. Confirm the left adrenal gland (arrow), which is located cranial to the cranial pole of the left kidney. A swollen lymph node (arrowhead) was observed, and the final diagnosis in this case was lymphoma. (B) Confirm the adrenolumbar vein (arrows), which runs from lateral to medial over the ventral surface of the left adrenal (dotted line), and ligate this vessel at the distal aspect using 4-0 absorbable suture or Hemoclips.

Medical management includes corticosteroids, such as prednisolone or prednisone, administered orally. Treatment may alleviate clinical signs associated with hypoglycemia but does not alter the progression of the disease process. Surgical excision of discrete pancreatic nodules is the recommended treatment of insulinoma in ferrets (Fig. 50) . ",
