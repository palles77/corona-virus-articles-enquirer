            "text": "The role of bovine respiratory viruses in precipitating severe BRD and bacterial pneumonias has long been known. Bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) (infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus); parainfluenza virus-3 (PI-3); and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) are recognized as primary respiratory pathogens. 5, 7 During the past 25 years, the roles of other viruses have been speculated on and investigated; several, including bovine rhinoviruses and adenoviruses, have been dismissed as minimal pathogens at best and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) has been recognized as a major pathogenic partner in BRD. 8 A pathogenic role for bovine respiratory coronavirus has been postulated, but if such a role exists, it is still under investigation. 9 BHV-1, PI-3, BRSV, and BVDV can cause some degree of acute respiratory disease. BHV-1 is well recognized as a cause of severe upper respiratory lesions, ranging from hemorrhage to diphtheritic membranes. 4 With the exception of certain instances of BRSV, fatality is usually not associated with those infections alone. Instead, their roles are primarily to assist in establishing a respiratory environment that is favorable to colonization and replication by several pathogenic bacteria resulting in pneumonia. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] This is done through two major mechanisms. The first is by alteration in mucosal surfaces such that adhesion of bacteria to virus-infected cells is enhanced; further colonization occurs more readily in areas of virus-induced mucosal erosion than in intact mucosa. [15] [16] [17] The second is modification of the innate and adaptive immune systems through altered alveolar macrophage function, suppression of lymphocyte proliferation and induced apoptosis, and modified cytokine and other inflammatory mediator release. 17 In an overview of the pathogenesis of pneumonia in feedlot cattle in a 1983 symposium on BRD, Thomson 18 described only Mannheimia haemolytica (formerly Pasteurella haemolytica) and Pasteurella multocida as bacterial pathogens in the BRD complex. Since that time, Histophilus somni (formerly Haemophilus somnus), Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Mycoplasma bovis, and, most recently, Bibersteinia trehalosi (formerly Pasteurella trehalosi) have also been recognized as additional bacterial agents associated with severe bovine bacterial pneumonia (Table 1) . 19, 20 These bacteria are ubiquitous in the cattle population as normal nasopharyngeal commensals and, after stress or viral infection, can proliferate and be inhaled into the lungs. Each has its own cadre of virulence factors, including biofilm, capsules, adhesins, toxins, and enzymes, that enhance its ability to colonize the lower airway, evade the immune system, resist antimicrobial treatment, cause tissue destruction, and incite an intense inflammatory response. 10 Differences in various virulence factors possessed by each bacterial species are responsible for the relative pathogenicity and lesions indicative of that particular infection (see Table 1 ). M haemolytica virulence factors include protein adhesins, capsular polysaccharide, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), iron-binding proteins, secreted enzymes, and a ruminant-specific RTX toxin-leukotoxin (LKT). 14 LPS and LKT are the two factors responsible for most of the destructive lesions of M haemolytica infection. Specific adhesins include a glycoprotein, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, that mediates adherence to tracheal epithelial cells and activates the oxidative burst of bovine neutrophils. Heat-modifiable outer membrane protein A (OmpA) and the surface lipoprotein 1 mediate M haemolytica binding to bronchial epithelial cells. In addition, the M haemolytica capsule may function as an adhesin in addition to its antiphagocytic properties. Fibrinogen-binding proteins have been identified. 21 Neuraminidase and sialoglycoprotease modify cell surfaces and may enhance bacterial adhesion. M haemolytica LPS has typical endotoxic and proinflammatory properties, causes vasculitis, and complexes with LKT enhancing LKT receptor production and augmenting LKT activity. LKT induces dose-related changes in bovine leukocytes, ranging from osmotic swelling, membrane pore formation, and necrosis to apoptosis or release of proinflammatory cytokines, oxygen-free radicals, and cellular protease. 14, [22] [23] [24] Evidence of biofilm formation with reduced antimicrobial susceptibility has been demonstrated. 25 P multocida virulence factors are less numerous than those identified in M haemolytica. Several adhesins, a thick polysaccharide capsule, and LPS are the major factors responsible for bacterial colonization, evasion of host defense, tissue destruction, and inflammation. 13 Adhesins are responsible for bacterial adherence to and colonization of cell surfaces. These include type IV fimbriae, OmpA, neuraminidase, and filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA). In addition, OmpA and various iron-binding proteins, such as hemoglobin-binding protein A and transferrin-binding protein A, bind fibronectin; and other extracellular matrix proteins may aid in invasion. The importance of capsule as a virulence determinant in the pathogenesis of P multocida infection is due to its antiphagocytic properties. P multocida LPS is a potent stimulator of inflammatory cytokines and a predominant inciter of pulmonary inflammation. 13 Evidence of biofilm formation with reduced antimicrobial susceptibility has been demonstrated. 25 H somni are nonencapsulated, and the virulence factors include lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and various outer membrane proteins, especially transferrin-binding proteins and immunoglobulin-binding proteins (IgBPs). 12 LOS can mediate endothelial cell apoptosis and, through antigenic phase variation, can assist the bacterium to escape the host immune response. LOS is the primary factor responsible for lesion formation by causing thrombosis, inflammation, and tissue destruction. IgBPs assist the bacterium to evade host defenses. They are surface-exposed fibrillar protein networks that bind the Fc domain of bovine IgG2 and are responsible for virulent strains that are resistant to phagocytosis and complement-mediated serum killing. 26 H somni produces histamine, which in conjunction with anti-major outer membrane protein IgE, may account for early respiratory lesions. 12, 27, 28 Recently, biofilm production by H somni within the host was documented, which allows the bacterial colonies to evade host defense and resist antimicrobial drugs. FHA proteins may be involved in that process. 29 M bovis virulence factors include variable surface proteins (VSPs) that function as adhesins allowing the bacterium to colonize bronchioles. VSPs are responsible for phenotypic variation among M bovis strains and, through antigenic phase variations, allow for evasion of host immune responses. 30, 31 A polysaccharide toxin has been described; however, the role or even existence of that toxin remains controversial. M bovis strains may produce hydrogen peroxide, which forms oxygen-free radicals and causes host lipid peroxidation. The formation of biofilm has been associated with many M bovis strains, and that trait enhances immune and antimicrobial resistance and colonization. 32 A pyogenes produces a collagen-binding protein (CbpA) that allows it to bind collagen and promotes adhesion to host cells. 33 A cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (pyolysin) that is a pore-forming cytolysin/hemolysin has been characterized. 34, 35 Adhesion may also be mediated by type II fimbriae and by two neuraminidases that cleave sialic acids and expose cell receptors. Several extracellular matrix-binding proteins that bind to collagen or fibronectin and exoenzymes (DNase and proteases) assist in invasion of tissue and degradation of proteins and nucleic acids. In addition, A pyogenes can evade host defenses by invasion of epithelium by intracellular survival in macrophages and by formation of biofilm. 36 Virulence factors of B trehalosi are not as well understood as those of many of the other BRD bacterial pathogens; however, there are many similarities with M haemolytica. Strains are encapsulated, and some strains are positive for LKT whereas others are not. 37 It is not clear whether or not strains that are LKT deficient are pathogenic.",

Traditional culture, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques are available in various laboratories across North America. Technique sensitivity and specificity differ among these tests, and results may vary depending on the test applied. For example, H somni was cultured from only 10 of 65 cases of pneumonia, yet the bacterium was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and PCR in 17, 19, and 29 of the cases, respectively. 40 In feedlots in particular, there is strong correlation between the time of onset of pneumonia, acuteness of the lesion, and the etiologic agents that can be isolated from that lesion. For example, Booker and colleagues 41 using immunohistochemistry demonstrated that in lungs from cattle dying of peracute to subacute pneumonia, M haemolytica, H somni, and M bovis were demonstrated in approximately more than 80%, less than 20%, and 50% to 60% of the lungs, respectively. In contrast, the incidences of M haemolytica, H somni, and M bovis were approximately 40%, 30%, and 90%, respectively, in chronic pneumonia; lungs were not examined for P multocida. Using bacteriologic culture, Fulton and colleagues 42 demonstrated that when M haemolytica was isolated from lungs of cattle dying of pneumonia the mean onset of fatal disease was approximately 19 days in the feedlot. In contrast, when M haemolytica was not isolated from the lungs, the mean day at onset was approximately 33 days on feed. The opposite was true for Mycoplasma sp isolation, whereas onset of disease was approximately 70 days for positive lungs and 29 days for negative lungs. To complicate matters further, multiple pathogenic bacteria are often isolated from individual cases of bovine pneumonia at necropsy resulting in an inability to identify the primary pathogen or pathogens. In several studies, more than 60% of the lungs from cattle dying of bacterial pneumonia contained more than one potentially pathogenic bacterial species. [41] [42] [43] Therefore, reliance on microbiologic techniques applied to lungs at necropsy, using culture or another means, such as PCR or immunohistochemistry, is likely not providing a clear representation of the role of specific pathogens in initiating the lesion. Finally, the characteristics and type of pneumonic lesion present at necropsy are determined by the inciting causative bacteria and concurrent or predisposing pathogens as well as the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of host defense mechanisms. In addition, lesion characteristics are highly dependent on acuteness or chronicity of the lesion as well as the types, numbers, and length of treatments received. 5 Inhaled bacterial pathogens first colonize the bronchoalveolar junction, overcome host defenses, incite inflammation at that site, and spread through contiguous airways or through adjacent components of lung tissue to produce three general types or patterns of pneumonia. These are suppurative bronchopneumonia (also called lobular bronchopneumonia), fibrinous pneumonia or pleuropneumonia (also called lobar pneumonia or fibrinous bronchopneumonia), and caseonecrotic pneumonia (also called mycoplasmal pneumonia). 4, 44 These various types of bronchopneumonia are classified based on the type of exudation present, initial site of bacterial localization in the airway, influence of various bacterial virulence factors, host resistance, and rapidity and method of spread of the infection within the lung. In addition, specific bronchopneumonia subclassifications are more commonly associated with specific bacteria.",

The rapid intra-and interlobular spread of M haemolytica is thought due to the effects of LPS on vascular integrity, severe cytolytic effects of LKT on resident and responding leukocytes, and the tissue destructive effects of released enzymes, oxygen radicals, and inflammatory mediators during that process. 14, 45 Fibrinous pneumonia is a bilateral, cranioventrally distributed, very firm, minimally compressible lung consolidation (Fig. 4) .

Sole Mycoplasma spp isolation occurs in less than 20% of BRD cases. 41, 43 Mycoplasma spp colonize the ciliated epithelium of the respiratory tract producing a mild mucopurulent bronchitis and bronchiolitis and, through persistent infection, pulmonary lesions may develop. 31 In mild, subacute cases, the main lesion is large peribronchial lymphocytic cuffs. Systemic spread of M bovis may lead to serofibrinous synovitis and otitis media. 47 Gross examination of the lung at this stage likely reveals no obvious changes or small patchy red to red-gray areas of cranioventral atelectasis.",

[48] [49] [50] M bovis virulence factors responsible for this lesion are not currently understood. At necropsy, the cranioventral lobes are expanded with firm consolidation, which is often visibly and palpably nodular (Fig. 7) . Clusters of discrete yellow foci of caseous necrosis are present within lobules, and these foci often range from 1 to 10 mm in diameter (Fig. 8) . The surrounding lobular tissue is often mottled to uniformly gray to dark red. In more severe lesions, necrotic foci coalesce and can involve an entire lobule. When the lung is squeezed, the necrotic material falls out as a single mass or multiple pieces. Sequestra may be seen. Expressed bronchial exudate may be mucoid to mucopurulent; the character of the exudate is likely determined by the presence or absence of other bacteria.

As in AIP of pastured cattle, a role for 3MI has been examined. In the feedlot disease, 3MI has been generally discounted because of the sporadic nature of the disease and lack of association with dietary change. In one feedlot study, however, blood levels of a 3MI metabolite were significantly higher in AIP than in control cattle suggesting a potential pathogenic role for 3MI. 54 Interstitial pneumonia also was described with some frequency in feedlot heifers fed melengestrol acetate to suppress estrus. 55 Several studies have investigated the association of BRSV and interstitial pneumonia with conflicting results; however, this may be because attempts to culture or demonstrate viral antigen is done using postmortem-collected specimens, and negative results may not accurately account for the virus' role in pathogenesis. 51, 54, 56, 57 Lesions of small airway disease, such as bronchiolar necrosis and, more commonly, its healing stage, bronchiolitis obliterans, are frequently found histologically in feedlot cases of interstitial pneumonia. 4, 6, 57 It was suggested that feedlot interstitial pneumonia might result from the effects of increased proinflammatory cytokines within lungs due to chronic bronchiolar disease, and endotoxin from gram-negative respiratory infections may contribute alveolar and bronchiolar damage leading to interstitial pneumonia. 52 Gross patterns of interstitial pneumonia in feedlot cattle include that of acute diffuse distribution but more frequently interstitial pneumonia is in caudal lobes combined with bronchopneumonia cranially (see Fig. 10 ). In addition, interstitial pneumonia may occur in a patchy distribution, with pneumonic lobules separated by prominently pale, bulging, overinflated lobules or groups of lobules (so-called checkerboard pattern) (see Fig. 11 ). 51, 56 Lesions of bronchopneumonia have been reported in 32% to 96% of fatal cases of feedlot AIP. Death due to AIP usually occurs from 21 to 73 days after onset of preceding respiratory illness, such as bronchopneumonia. 6, 57, 58 Gross lesions of feedlot cases of interstitial pneumonia are typical. Bilaterally, lungs fail to collapse and are overinflated and heavy with variable amounts of interlobular edema and emphysema. The lesion may be diffuse, but it is usually more obvious in the caudal dorsal lobes. Cranioventral bronchopneumonia or fibrinous pneumonia is often visible. Palpation of caudal areas reveals a rubbery texture in a diffuse but more commonly a slightly lumpy pattern, wherein rubbery texture is confined to individual lobules separated by palpably normal lobules. Affected lobules range from pale red-gray, pink or tan, to clear fluid exudes or can be expressed from the cut surface unless concurrent suppurative bronchitis or bronchopneumonia is present. The so-called checkerboard pattern of rubbery, perhaps dark lobules interspersed with normal to pale, overinflated lobules may be seen; however, in many cases of interstitial pneumonia, the lesion is not visually obvious but palpably so.",

Although the lesions of bovine respiratory coronavirus infection are not well documented, and several investigators have failed to reproduce a lung disease with these viruses, experimental infection of calves with a winter dysentery bovine coronavirus resulted in small intestine villous atrophy and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. [59] [60] [61] Bronchointerstitial pneumonia is characterized by bronchiolar epithelial and pneumocytic damage resulting in bronchiolar necrosis, mild inflammatory cell influx, and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. In the field, bronchointerstitial pneumonia is often complicated with secondary bacterial infection, which obscures and overshadows the primary viral lesion. Therefore, cases of true bronchointerstitial pneumonia are only occasionally recognized. For example, bronchointerstitial pneumonia was recognized in only 3 of 214 (1.4%) pneumonic lungs in a recent feedlot study. 42 Gross lesions of bronchointerstitial pneumonia have been documented best in BRSV infections, are cranioventral distributed, and are often subtle ranging from reddened areas of atelectasis to rubbery gray lobules. 62 If exudate is expressible, it is usually mucoid to mucopurulent.

The characteristics of the resulting pneumonic lesion are dependent on the nature and distribution of the material as well as the extent and type of bacterial contamination. [3] [4] [5] Aspiration due to faulty intubation, dysphagia, regurgitation, and infected large particles of necrotic mucosa from upper respiratory lesions can cause aspiration pneumonia. Pail-or bottle-fed calves, intubation and balling gun accidents, traumatic pharyngitis, rumenitis from ingesta of oilfield fluids, and prolonged recumbency have all been implicated in causing aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration of rumen contents is, by far, the most common cause of aspiration pneumonia of cattle. The resulting lesions are often unilateral, necrotizing to gangrenous, and predominantly cranioventral (Figs. 14 and 15 ). Another diagnostically useful feature of distribution exists when the pneumonic lesion is not only unilateral but also caudally situated without cranial lung involvement. Fibrinopurulent to suppurative pleuritis is commonly present and covers the necrotic foci; empyema may result from ruptured foci. 58 Pneumonic lesions are brown to green and may be hemorrhagic, often forming cystic cavities exuding malodorous brown fluid that may contain ingesta. Putrid odors are especially prevalent in the presence of aspirated rumen anaerobic bacteria. Foreign material may be readily visible within the airways, but terminal aspiration of rumen contents must not be mistaken for a lesion of aspiration pneumonia. If the inciting material is lipid-rich, lipid droplets are visible floating on bronchoalveolar fluids.",

In the patent period, adult worms develop in bronchi and induce eosinophilic to mucopurulent bronchitis, resulting in atelectasis, emphysema and a verminous pneumonia. 3, 4, 64 Gross examination of patent infections reveals bilateral lesions first in the caudal lung lobes consisting of caudal-dorsal, wedge-shaped areas of moderate firmness (Fig. 18 ) and in severe infections throughout the lungs. Lesions vary from red and atelectatic to consolidated and gray or pale and overinflated. Emphysema due to forced expiration and bronchiolar lesions may be seen in severe cases.

Endemic and sporadic tuberculosis in some wild and farm-reared cervids throughout the United States and occasional diagnoses in cattle, particularly in the northern Midwestern states and along the southern US border, are reminders that vigilance is still needed to accurately recognize and diagnose the disease. [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] In cattle, M bovis causes caseous granulomas in the lungs and occasionally in other organs. 71 Regional lymph nodes, especially retropharyngeal and bronchial, particular targets of M bovis infection, are usually involved and help distinguish tuberculosis from other purulent to caseous pneumonias (Fig. 19) . The classical lesion of tuberculosis is the tubercle. Tubercles are usually circumscribed, often encapsulated, 1-to 40-mm granulomatous foci containing white to pale yellow caseous necrosis with or without foci of mineralization. 4 Liquefaction may develop in some older lesions. 68 At necropsy, lesions may not be obvious even in an animal that reacted positively on a tuberculin skin test. Careful examination of lymph nodes, in particular retropharyngeal, bronchial, and mediastinal, may demonstrate granulomatous inflammation and tubercle formation. Lung lesions are present in approximately 10% to 20% of the cases. In rare generalized cases, small disseminated caseous to caseocalcareous tubercles are present throughout the lungs. More commonly, solitary or clusters of tubercles are present, particularly in the caudal lung lobe. Liquefaction may occur in large Fig. 19 .
