Method: In this cross-sectional study, knowledge, attitude, and practice related to SP among four medical staff groups -surgeons, surgical residents, physicians and medical residents -were assessed using a questionnaire. Results: Across the four medical staffing groups the median levels of knowledge ranged from 6 to 7 (maximum score 9), median attitude scores were high ranging from 35 to 36 (maximum score 45), while median practice scores were low, ranging from 2 to 3 (maximum score 9). A moderate relationship between knowledge and attitudes was found in surgical residents and medical residents (r = 0.397, p = 0.030 and r = 0.554, p = 0.006, respectively). No significant correlation was found between knowledge and practice between the groups. A significant but poor (r = 0.399, p = 0.029) relationship between attitude and practice was found in surgical residents. Conclusion: Specific training programs may have to target newly graduated medical practitioners to establish acceptance of appropriate practices that will enable them to adopt and adhere to SP while their older counterparts may require more intense continuous assistance. # 2006 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

Adherence to SP is even more important with the emergence of infectious diseases, such as avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and the threat of bioterrorism. 7 The problems of containing drugresistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus 8-10 and vancomycin-resistant enterococci from colonizing patients give a continuous reminder to HCWs that adherence to SP is also pivotal to patient safety in terms of healthcare-associated infections. In 1996, the Centers for Disease Control proposed Guidelines for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals, as new, two-tiered best practice of infection control precautions that are standard for all patients who are to be regarded as potential carriers of pathogenic microorganisms. 1,10 Strict adherence to SP guidelines is necessary to prevent exposure to potentially life-threatening infections, 3,11-15 yet a high level of compliance with SP has been reported to be problematic worldwide. 3, 4, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Medical practitioners, especially surgeons, are among high-risk healthcare workers for exposure to blood-borne or other infections during direct patient contact. [2] [3] [4] The purpose of our study was to measure the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice in surgeons and physicians in Shiraz University of Medical Sciences affiliated hospitals.",

The questionnaire was prepared by an infection control expert, a pediatrician certified in infectious diseases, and a psychiatrist, and reviewed by experts from the Iranian National Expert Group of Infection Control Specialists. It consisted of questions on knowledge, attitude, and practice of the guidelines with respect to standard isolation precautions as described by the CDC. The questionnaire was pre-tested on a random sample of participants to ensure practicability, validity, and interpretation of responses. The validity of the questionnaire was assessed using the Kuder-Richardson test for reliability and Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient.",

All responses in accordance with CDC guidelines 1,10 were given a score value of 1 for correct answers to the knowledge questions and when answers for practice questions were ''always'', while a score zero was assigned to all other answers. The total scores ranged from zero to 9. For attitude questions, a score of 5 was equivalent to the answer ''very strong'' and a score of 1 to ''nil'', therefore, the total score ranged from 9 to 45 ( Table 1 ). The questionnaire was pre-tested on 21 randomly-selected members from the target population with high test-retest reliability (alpha = 0.73). Descriptive and inferential statistics including significance tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Kruskall-Wallis test, and Spearman correlation coefficient were performed using SPSS version 10.0.

[2] [3] [4] This study was limited by its reliance on self-reporting rather than by observing compliance with SP by practitioners. However, self-reported attitudes towards SP and compliance were low. Our poor compliance with many SP practices is not unique to our teaching hospitals, with similar results published in other centers. 3, 4, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] While principles of SP should be strictly observed by surgeons and physicians for their own safety as well as setting leadership roles for their residents, success in the implementation of SP guidelines depends on many factors such as optimal awareness and a positive attitude in all HCWs, and these goals are not reached without qualified personnel receiving continuing regular education, as has been repeatedly demonstrated in the literature. 4, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] Our study revealed that more than 80% of all medical practitioners had not received previous SP education, and that more than 80% were willing to be trained. These findings illustrate that SP practices are not behaviors readily adopted, even by those aware of the SP issue and moderate to low levels of attitudes. A revision of current medical curricula offered in Iran may be required that mandates all medical students and hospital trainees attend infection control courses specific to their clinical terms. Although all our medical practitioners reported a willingness to be trained, compliance behavior is complex. 33 Some barriers to adherence observed internationally include inadequacy of equipment and facilities and difficulties of access to equipment, stressful working conditions, and the belief that practice of SP may interfere with patient care. 2, 23, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] Influencing the Iranian senior practitioner may require elements of other successful programs Knowledge, attitude, and practices related to standard precautions 217 and innovative approaches, such as improved hospital infrastructure that offers an infection control awareness week with infection control auditors to inform about correct practices at the time incorrect practices are observed, freely available personal protective equipment, such as gowns, gloves and masks, with reinforcing posters but also staff seminars launched on a platform of the importance of consistent SP practice for personal protection in times of emerging diseases.",
