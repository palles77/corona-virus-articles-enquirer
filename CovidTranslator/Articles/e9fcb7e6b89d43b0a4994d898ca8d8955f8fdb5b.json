Examples include the successful implementation of vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials during the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa. On the other end of the spectrum was the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of peramivir in the treatment of H1N1 influenza virus that did not provide an opportunity to collect data or understand the effectiveness of the EUA program. Between the gold standard of a randomized controlled clinical trial and the problems associated with EUAs are the domain of expanded access protocols that may provide an avenue to make products available while awaiting licensure. This paper will examine the regulatory pathways in the United States (US) for the use of investigational drugs in a public health emergency as well as considerations when making these products available outside the US. Descriptions of the applications of the various approaches will be presented. Regardless of the pathway chosen, public health and clinical research planners need to work together to consider several factors associated with the respective options and maintain a goal of working toward the collection of data to support licensure before faced with future outbreaks. Finally, this paper will consider the lessons learned from public health response in the context of investigational drugs in other diseases where \"right to try laws\" may pose opportunities, as well as challenges.",

A logical framework for proceeding in this context proposed by Lane, Marston, and Fauci provided the core principles for conducting clinical research in an outbreak. 3, 4 Those principles are identified in Table 1 . In their paper, they note that definitive studies lead to more rapid licensure, and it is hoped, more rapid distribution of approved vaccines and treatments. During the EVD outbreak in West Africa in 2014 and 2015, the governments of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea invited the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to collaborate with researchers in their countries in a program of research that aimed to benefit those countries. The NIAID team was able to collaborate with West African investigators to conduct natural history, preventive vaccine, and therapeutic studies. For example, through engagement with the Ebola response framework in Liberia, research proposals were vetted that included community and scientific input as well as the development of infrastructure to conduct that research. The initial vaccine study concept was vetted through a standing body at the World Health Organization (WHO) and was overseen by a Data Safety Monitoring Board of international and West African composition. Results from these studies either have been published or are in press. Moreover, the NIAID research program has maintained a presence in West Africa further developing both physical and human clinical research capacity. The NIAID response was focused on the collection of high-quality data in an ethical framework to support answering important questions about investigational vaccines and therapeutics. However, during the Ebola outbreak, there was considerable pressure to use any product available regardless of their unknown risks and benefits.",

The uncontrolled settings in which these products are used casts doubt on the integrity of any data collected.

While these companies are allowed by US law to charge for their investigational drugs used under compassionate use provisions, 21 CFR 312.8(d)(1) states that \"a sponsor may recover only the direct costs of making its investigational drug available.\" 7 While the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does allow for the manufacturer to recoup direct costs, many other costs are not compensated, unlike products with marketing authorization, such as those to recoup research and development costs. For example, the overhead costs associated with maintaining the safety oversight system becomes increasingly complicated when an investigational product is made available outside the context of traditional well-defined clinical trials. The greatest cost to manufacturers for the provision of a drug under compassionate use may actually be the opportunity cost of collecting data on their product to gain marketing authorization. The provision of a product under expanded access in an outbreak rather than the conduct of a controlled clinical trial to collect data to support approval has the potential to deny the pharmaceutical company from valuable information to support a marketing application. This translates to a time cost for approval, which also has a societal cost, as fewer patients will have access to the product prior to approval.",

PREVAIL was designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two EVD vaccines among volunteers in the midst of the EVD outbreak in Liberia. 8 The ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine (GlaxoSmith Kline) consisted of a ChAd3 vector with a DNA fragment insert that encodes the EVD virus glycoprotein. The VSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine (NewLink/Merck) was comprised of a single recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) isolate modified to replace the gene encoding the G envelope glycoprotein (GP) with the gene encoding the envelope glycoprotein from the EVD virus Zaire strain (ZEBOV). The first phase of the study was to include 1,500 EVD-free adult volunteers at one clinical site on the outskirts of Monrovia and expand to 27,000 volunteers at multiple sites around the country. Fortunately for the people of Liberia, the public health measures they implemented were successful in bringing the bulk of the epidemic to a close by May of 2015 at about the same time that the initial 1,500 participants were enrolled. The data and safety monitoring board recommended against expanding the trial as it would have been statistically futile to achieve the number of endpoints to determine a difference between the study vaccines and placebo. While an efficacy endpoint was not possible, substantial safety and immunogenicity data were obtained to support a future licensure application. 9",

First, as the study involved inclusion of multiple sites in both Sierra Leone and Guinea, establishing cold-chain and clinical trial operations processes in those countries involved different approaches. In Sierra Leone, NIAID collaborated with the CDC in the utilization of a storage facility co-located with the UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) Expanded Program for Immunization. To implement the study, NIAID rotated in teams consisting of physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and logisticians to work with the medical staffs at participating EVD Treatment Units (ETUs). Additional in-country staff were hired to help with data collection and maintaining contact with research participants after they were discharged. In Guinea, NIAID worked with an INSERM (French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) team of clinical research personnel who were embedded in an ETU under management by the French Red Cross.

While designed to enroll up to 200 participants, the trial was prematurely stopped by the Data Safety Monitoring Board for lack of enrollment prospects, with the enrollment of only 72 participants. While the standard of care alone arm had an overall fatality rate of 37% versus 22% for the ZMapp treatment arm, the posterior probability of ZMapp superiority was 91.2%, short of the 97.5% statistical significance threshold. 16, 17 Obtaining the desired enrollment for the study would have required participation by many additional ETUs. Unfortunately, the operation of the ETUs was not centrally managed within the country, and a variety of non-governmental organizations provided on-the-ground staffing for ETUs. Not all of those organizations were interested in taking part in clinical trials or, if they were interested, had philosophical differences with the concept of a placebocontrolled study. 5 Without the use of a placebo or nontreatment arm, it is difficult to attribute safety and efficacy to the intervention being tested. 3 It is important to determine if the study intervention harms patients, especially if there is an opportunity cost associated with the use of one treatment in lieu of another.",

From a regulatory perspective, MappBio, Zmapp's manufacturer, and the FDA were keen to have patients enrolled in the PREVAIL II study, rather than providing drug for compassionate use to new EVD cases. However, from an operational perspective, NIAID and the participating countries ended the ZMapp trial in February 2016, as it had been more than 45 days since the last known case of EVD. It did not mean that the subregion of West Africa was truly free of EVD. For sporadic events that did occur, NIAID, as the Investigational New Drug (IND) sponsor for the PREVAIL II trial, did not request compassionate use of ZMapp in West Africa, but did provide regulatory advice and technical expertise to groups that did seek to use ZMapp on a compassionate basis for patients who were not eligible for enrollment in PREVAIL II or who contracted EVD after PREVAIL II ceased enrollment. Because the treatment of EVD is a time-sensitive endeavor, the only feasible way to get ZMapp to a patient in West Africa was through NIAID's PREVAIL II clinical trial supply. In this regard, NIAID worked with FDA and MappBio to allow for an \"alternative disposition\" of the needed number of ZMapp vials, pursuant to 21 CFR 312.59 and the previously mentioned 21 CFR 312.110(b). 19 Moreover, NIAID worked with the affected countries to ensure that mechanisms to provide the unapproved drugs were consistent with the FDA emergency use regulations.

Establishing realistic and reasonable pathways to licensure will benefit all concerned-the countries impacted, the global population at risk as these diseases spread, government and private research institutions and industry partners as well as donor organizations that frequently help respond to public health crises. The goal of a commonsense regulatory framework is to avoid shortterm solutions that have the potential to result in long-term problems such as continued requirements for global support. One part of the solution is to establish a framework to respond more rapidly with clinical trial protocols and supporting materials, including trained personnel if possible, with the anticipation of an outbreak. Governmental research organizations such as NIAID and others are well suited to work with industry in this regard, as the resources required to implement research in an outbreak are significant, and many of these drugs are unlikely to be commercially viable in the traditional drug market.",
