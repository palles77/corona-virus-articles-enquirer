Improved investigative and diagnostic tools-necessary to understand disease processes and to identify subclinical infection-are much sought after. Here, we describe the production of single-chain antibodies with defined specificity for M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis surface proteins. Single-chain antibodies (scFv) were generated from sheep with Johne's disease by cloning heavychain and lambda light-chain variable regions and expressing these in fusion with gene III of filamentous phages. Two scFv clones (designated SurfS1.2 and SurfS2.2) were shown to be immunoreactive against M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis surface targets by flow cytometry, and immunoblotting identified specificity for a 34-kDa proteinase-susceptible determinant. Both antibodies were cross-reactive against Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium but nonreactive against Mycobacterium bovis or Mycobacterium phlei cells and were shown to be capable of enriching M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis cells by a factor of approximately 10 6 -fold when employed in magnetic bead separation of mixed Mycobacterium sp. cultures. Further, magnetic bead separation using SurfS1.2 and SurfS2.2 was capable of isolating as few as 10 3 M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis cells from ovine fecal samples, indicating the diagnostic potential of these reagents. Finally, inclusion of SurfS1.2 or SurfS2.2 in in vitro broth culture with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis indicated that surface binding activity did not impede bacterial growth, although colony clumping was prevented. These results are discussed in terms of the potential use of single-chain phage display monoclonal antibodies as novel diagnostic reagents.",

            "text": "The Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) includes major pathogens for humans, birds, and ruminants. The most important members of this complex are Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium, as it causes disseminated infections in patients with AIDS that do not receive treatment or where modern antihuman immunodeficiency virus therapy fails (7) , and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, the causative agent of Johne's disease (JD). Johne's disease is a chronic enteritis of ruminants that produces major economic losses in livestock and dairy industries worldwide. Infection due to M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis manifests as a chronic inflammatory gastroenteritis, with progressive infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes into lesion sites in the intestinal mucosa and submucosa, which eventually produce extensive granuloma in the affected sites and draining lymphatic tissues (20) . The underlying pathology leads to epithelial thickening in the lower intestine, causing malabsorption of nutrients, leading to wasting and eventual death in affected animals. Ruminants affected by JD develop strong immunological reactivity against M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis antigens, comprising activation of peripheral blood CD4 \u03e9 lymphocytes capable of secreting gamma interferon, along with the production of immunoglobulin G (IgG) class antibodies specific for mycobacterial surface glycolipids, particularly during the later stages of disease. However, it can take several months to years for clinical symptoms of JD to present, highlighting the chronic nature of the disease. It is during the chronic, subclinical, and clinical stages of JD that affected animals lose condition, causing the major economic losses to industry through reduced production.",

As an alternative to hybridoma technology, reverse transcription-PCR amplification of the variable region of both the light and heavy chains of large animal host immunoglobulins has enabled the recombination of functional antibody fragments in Escherichia coli expression systems (16) . The translational fusion of these to genes of filamentous phages has further made the selection of singlechain antibody fragments (scFv) by phage display possible. Antibody phage display technology has begun to replace standard hybridoma technology (29) and has allowed the generation of monoclonal antibody fragments from species other than rodents, including humans, rabbits, chickens, camels, and sheep (13) .",

The M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis cell lysate and intact cell suspensions of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis 316F, M. avium subsp. avium, and Mycobacterium phlei in PBS-4% skim milk powder were used to screen homologous and cross-reactive antibodies. Phagemid particles were res-cued from the scFv library and used to pan against mycobacterial antigen targets that had been immobilized on Immunotubes (MaxiSorb, Nunc, Denmark) as described previously (15) . The expression library was panned with two experimental designs. One part of the library was panned twice against an M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis lysate and once against M. avium subsp. avium whole cells.

Both sublibraries were preabsorbed against M. phlei cells (10 11 to 10 12 scFv displaying phage were incubated with 200 l of M. phlei cells for 1 h). Bound phages were released by the addition of 100 mM glycine (pH 2.2) followed by neutralization with 2 M Tris (pH 7.0). Rescued single clones were tested by phage ELISA using 96-well ELISA plates (MaxiSorb, Nunc, Denmark) that had been coated with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis strain 316F cell lysate. Bound phages were detected with monoclonal antibody anti-M13 conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia) and visualized with TMB substrate (Sigma, Australia).

Simultaneous labeling of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis cells with both SurfS1.2 and SurfS2.2 indicated that the surface-binding signal was similar to that obtained using either antibody in isolation (Fig. 3C ). Heat inactivation of the bacterium (80\u00b0C/1 h) led to a minor increase in the fluorescence signal after staining with either SurfS1.2 or SurfS2.2, while fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde did not alter the signal (data not shown), indicating that the antibody fragments were robust to fixation processes used in flow cytometry. Further flow cytometric analysis using SurfS1.2 and SurfS2.2 indicated that they both displayed surface binding activity against M. avium subsp. avium cells (Fig. 4) . The patterns of antibody surface binding were largely unaffected by prestressing bacteria due to high pH, temperature shock, or oxidative stress (Fig. 4) , with the only exception being preexposure of M. avium subsp. avium cells to pH 4 conditions, which increased surface binding of SurfS2.2 (Fig. 4B) . The surface labeling intensity due to SurfS1.2 binding appeared similar in early-and late-growth-phase samples of M. avium subsp. avium cells (Fig.  4C ); in contrast, the signal provided by SurfS2.2 appeared diminished in the early-phase samples (Fig. 4D) . Influence of surface-bound scFv on the growth of M. avium subsp. avium. To determine whether surface-bound SurfS1.2 or SurfS2.2 could influence mycobacterial growth, M. avium subsp. avium was grown in Middlebrook broth without dispersal reagents such as Tween 80 in the presence or absence of SurfS1.2 or SurfS2.2. In the absence of dispersal reagents, mycobacterial cells readily formed clumps (Fig. 5A) ; clumping was clearly reduced in cultures by the inclusion of SurfS1.2 (Fig. 5C ) or SurfS2.2 (Fig. 5D) . Inclusion of an irrelevant scFv control did not alter the clumping characteristics of M. avium subsp. avium (Fig. 5B ). Following coculture of target cells with antibodies, samples were resuspended and OD measurements taken; over a serial dilution range, there was no obvious difference in the end-point growths of cells that had been incubated with and without Surf antibodies (Fig. 5E ). Immunomagnetic separation of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis from M. phlei. Magnetic beads were coated with either SurfS1.2, SurfS2.2, or an irrelevant scFv control and used for cell separation. To visually distinguish M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis from M. phlei, cells were fluorescently labeled with either fluorescein isothiocyanate or TRITC as described above. An influence of the fluorescent dye was excluded by repeating the experiment and labeling mycobacterial species with the opposite dye. Magnetic bead separation with both SurfS1.2 and SurfS2.2 resulted in an enrichment of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis by a factor of approximately 10 6 from a cell suspension with a ratio of 1:1,000 M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis to M. phlei cells (Fig.  6 ). Magnetic beads coated with an unrelated antibody fragment or with an antibody fragment that was negative in fluorescenceactivated cell sorter analysis (SurfS1.23) led to loss of bacterial cells and no enrichment of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (data not shown).",

The utility of the isolated scFv antibody fragments for detection of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in fecal samples was evaluated by first using the antibodies to capture bacterial cells and then determining whether DNA from these cells would remain amplifiable by IS900 PCR. PBS-diluted fecal samples were spiked with heat-killed M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis cells ranging from 10 2 to 10 6 cells per g of feces, which were subsequently recovered by scFv antibody magnetic separation and subject to PCR amplification. A minor reduction in the PCR product yield was observed after the addition of magnetic beads (data not shown). Detection of the lower limit of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis cells (10 2 /g) was possible, but the result was shown to be inconsistent; in contrast, detection of samples with 10 3 M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis cells/g feces or higher was positive and consistent (Fig. 7) . Beads coated with irrelevant antibody fragments did not result in positive IS900 PCR (Fig. 7) .",

            "text": "The present study has used phage display technology to develop single-chain antibodies with specificity against surface determinants of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. This is the first report of the successful cloning of scFv with high affinity from a Mycobacterium-infected ruminant and raises the possibility that phage display technology could be utilized to further characterize antibody reactivity in other ruminant species (including cattle and deer) that are economically important and naturally susceptible hosts for virulent mycobacteria, including Flow cytometry in the present study identified that scFv binding activity was detected strongly at the mycobacterial cell surface and that this activity was common against both M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis and M. avium subsp. avium cells, but not against M. bovis BCG or M. phlei. The common reactivity of SurfS1.2 and SurfS2.2 against M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis and M. avium subsp. avium surface antigens is not surprising, given the close phylogenetic relatedness of these two species. In a practical sense, this common reactivity allowed further study of the interaction of scFv with live mycobacteria using M. avium subsp. avium cells as the target, thus overcoming the inherent difficulties in culturing M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in vitro (1) . To that end, SurfS1.2 or SurfS2.2 was included in cultures of live, actively metabolizing M. avium subsp. avium cells. The noted clumping of mycobacterial cells (which is evident unless a dispersal agent such as Tween 80 is included in the growth medium) was prevented by the coinclusion of either antibody, suggesting that surface binding by SurfS1.2 and SurfS2.2 impedes cell aggregation. Despite this, there was no obvious effect on bacterial culture optical density, indicating that these antibodies did not impair mycobacterial growth rates in vitro, as has been shown for scFv against Helicobacter pylori (4) . The fact that SurfS1.2 and SurfS2.2 do not inhibit the performance of live mycobacterial cells makes them suitable as tools for target cell separation and subsequent culturing, as a toxic effect is not desirable prior to culturing when using antibodies in a diagnostic context. Interestingly, antigen recognition in live M. avium subsp. avium was unaffected by intrinsic bacterial growth characteristics or by extrinsic stressors of the bacteria when using SurfS1.2 as a probe, suggesting that the epitope recognized by this antibody is expressed constitutively; in contrast, preexposure of live M. avium subsp. avium cells to low pH resulted in an up-regulation of the surface binding activity of SurfS2.2, while in contrast, cells harvested during the early phase of their log growth showed a reduced labeling intensity with SurfS2.2, which may indicate that the epitope determinant recognized by SurfS2.2 is under regulatory control by the bacterium.",

            "text": "A previous study has reported the potential of polyclonal rabbit anti-M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis antibodies to be used as a separation tool to detect M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis cells in milk or fecal samples (14) . Here, we have reported that SurfS1.2 and SurfS2.2 single-chain antibodies can bind to and selectively isolate target M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis cells, both from culture samples bearing mixed mycobacterial species and from feces artificially spiked with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis cells. The use of polyclonal antibodies for target cell recognition suffers from the potential for cross-reactivity against environmental species, including environmental mycobacteria like M. phlei (8) , and methods based on polyclonal antibodies may be very difficult to standardize. Therefore, in this initial study, we have shown that ovine scFv can be used to specifically separate M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis from M. phlei and to isolate M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis from fecal samples. As the scFv did not crossreact with M. phlei or M. bovis BCG, the immunomagnetic separation method may be unaffected by the presence of environmental mycobacteria; however, since both scFv cross-reacted with M. avium subsp. avium, an ancillary verification test for M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (such as specific IS900 PCR) is essential. In this study, the detection limit of target mycobacterial cells was approximately 10 3 bacteria/4 ml fecal sample using SurfS1.2 or SurfS2.2 scFv, which is higher than that described for immunomagnetic bead separation with polyclonal antibodies (14) . While that may be a result of an initial centrifugation step employed here to separate bacteria from fibrous material present in sheep feces (and the consequent loss of some bacteria), the important fact remains that isolated M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis cells could be further identified using IS900 PCR (without prior DNA amplification), indicating the compatibility of these two screening methodologies in tandem. In a practical sense, the opportunity to undertake diagnostic PCR without DNA purification, as has been routine for diagnosis of M. tuberculosis (2) , would reduce the cost and time of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis detection in field practice.",

A recent review (21) has highlighted the utility of employing phage display technology in the study of microbial infectious diseases, including defining protein-ligand interactions, epitope mapping, and screening for receptor agonists or antagonists. Further, recent studies have reported the use of recombinant phage technology to establish scFv libraries with defined specificity for pathogens, such as coronavirus (19) and Clostridium difficile toxin (6) , that may have applications in vaccine development or diagnostics for human use. The work reported here has further demonstrated that it may be possible to develop scFv as rapid and cost-effective tools for research in (and diagnosis of) ruminant Johne's disease, applicable to livestock husbandry.",
