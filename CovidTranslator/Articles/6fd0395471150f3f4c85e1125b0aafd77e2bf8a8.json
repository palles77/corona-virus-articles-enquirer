This modification has not been described for any other viral protein; however, many viral transmembrane glycoproteins contain one or more of the recognition motifs (W-x-x-W). Elimination of the C-mannose on sGP did not significantly alter protein biosynthesis, processing or structure. Furthermore, the protective effect of sGP on endothelial barrier function, currently the only known activity of sGP, was unaltered. It is possible that C-mannosylation may be a common post-translational modification of viral transmembrane glycoproteins where it could play a role in particle maturation and/or entry by stabilizing the structure of these proteins. In this regard, C-mannosylation of sGP may be an anomaly resulting from the unique manner in which this protein is generated as the product of unedited transcripts from the glycoprotein gene of Ebola.",

            "text": "Ebola viruses (EBOV) belong to the family Filoviridae in the order Mononegavirales. These viruses cause a severe hemorrhagic fever, termed Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF), with fatality rates as high as 90% (Feldmann et al., 2003) . The fourth gene of the EBOV genome encodes the precursors of a soluble non-structural glycoprotein (pre-sGP) and the structural transmembrane glycoprotein (pre-GP) (Sanchez et al., 1996; Volchkov et al., 1995) . Pre-sGP is the primary product and is processed by signalase and furin cleavage into sGP and \u0394-peptide (Volchkova et al., 1999) , both of which are secreted. sGP has been detected in the serum of infected individuals (Sanchez et al., 1996) and is hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of EHF (Feldmann et al., 2003) . Pre-GP undergoes similar processing to yield the mature viral spike protein GP 1,2 , which consists of the two disulphide-bonded cleavage fragments GP 1 and GP 2 . sGP shares the 295 N-terminal amino acids with GP 1 but has a unique 28 amino acid carboxyl-terminus, whereas pre-GP is only expressed after RNA editing (Volchkov et al., 1995) . Despite the large region of shared primary sequence, these proteins are markedly different in their structure, with sGP forming homodimers Barrientos et al., 2004; Falzarano et al., 2006) , which according to the more recent studies seem to exist in a parallel rather than an anti-parallel orientation, and GP 1,2 forming trimers . These proteins also differ in their function; GP 1,2 has been shown to mediate virus entry (attachment and fusion) (Feldmann et al., 2001) while sGP, besides additional yet unknown functions, might have an anti-inflammatory role (Wahl-Jensen et al., 2005) . As part of our efforts to characterize the structure of sGP (including co-and post-translational modifications) for future functional studies, we recently demonstrated that in contrast to GP 1,2 , which is heavily N-and O-glycosylated (Feldmann et al., 2001) , sGP carries solely N-linked carbohydrates (Falzarano et al., 2006) . Here we discuss the discovery of a novel type of glycosylation, termed C-mannosylation, which has yet to be identified for any viral protein. Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) sGP was found to possess a C-mannose on tryptophan (Trp) residue 288 (W 288 ). A mutant sGP lacking this modification was unaltered in its biosynthesis, processing, structure and potential anti-inflammatory function. This raises the question as to whether C-mannosylation of sGP has functional consequences or if it is a fortuitous occurrence due to the parasitic nature of viruses in mammalian cells.",

            "text": "Ebola virus sGP is C-mannosylated sGP peptide mapping by MALDI MS and HPLC-MALDI MS was performed as previously described following trypsin digestion (Falzarano et al., 2006) . Two unmodified tryptic pep-tides containing amino acids 288 to 291 (WAFW) were found: T26 (VNPEIDTTIGEWAFWETK) and T26 + T27 (VNPEIDT-TIGEWAFWETKK) (Fig. 1A) . The presence of a peptide with a missed cleavage is typical when there are two adjacent cut sites (KK) and in this case results in two peaks separated by \u223c 128.095 Da. Both peptides showed + 162 Da adducts, consistent with the mass of a hexose residue (162.053 Da, Delta Mass-a database of protein post-translational modifications, http://www.abrf.org/index.cfm/dm.home). A comparison of the relative intensities of the non-modified peptides and their respective + 162 Da adducts (Fig. 1A) suggested that approximately 60% of the peptides were modified. MALDI MS analysis allowed all four of the fragments to be observed simultaneously, while HPLC-MALDI MS analysis introduces an additional retention time shift for the +162 Da modified species-they elute \u223c 1 min earlier under the chromatographic conditions used. This finding is consistent with the addition of a hydrophilic sugar moiety to a hydrophobic Trp residue. The identification of this post-translational modification was further supported by the presence of the recognition sequence, W-x-x-W, for Cmannosylation at amino acid position 288 to 291 (W-A-F-W) of sGP, which was part of both peptides.",

A complete series of y ions (y 2 to y 6 ) confirms that W 291 is unmodified, while all y ions starting at y 7 have a mass increase of 162 Da.

This is not unexpected as others have reported that C-mannosylation occurs in multiple tissue types from diverse species (Krieg et al., 1997; Doucey et al., 1998) . In addition, sGP purified from ZEBOV-infected Vero cells was shown to contain the Cmannosylated peptide T26 following HPLC-MALDI MS (Fig.   2C ), but in contrast to the transfected cell lines, only Cmannosylated peptides were detected. To confirm this result, the peak corresponding to C-mannosylated T26 was selected for MS/MS which yielded results identical to Fig. 1C (data not shown).",

This potential anti-inflammatory role of sGP is structure dependent (Falzarano et al., 2006) and currently the only functional test for this protein. It has been suggested that C-mannosylation may play a role in protein folding, especially involving folding around disulphide bonds. The location of the C-mannosylated W 288 is in close proximity to the cysteine residue involved in one of the intermolecular disulphide bonds (C 306 ) important for the formation of sGP homodimers (Barrientos et al., 2004; Falzarano et al., 2006) . As observed previously (Wahl-Jensen et al., 2005) , treatment of endothelial cells with TNF-\u03b1 leads to a decrease in transendothelial resistance (TER), which can be partially reversed by sGP (Fig. 4) . The same rescue effect was also observed when endothelial cells were treated simultaneously with TNF-\u03b1 and sGP-WXXA (Fig. 4) , demonstrating that the lack of C-mannosylation of W 288 did not alter this biological function of sGP, although it may still be important for another as of yet unidentified function.",

This predictive modeling gives a yes/no (NN) or a predicted signal peptide/non-secretory protein/signal anchor prediction (HMM). From this analysis, 373 viral proteins were Fig. 4 .

Here we present the first identification of C-mannosylation on a viral protein-ZEBOV sGP. Abolishment of C-mannosylation did not significantly alter the biosynthesis, processing or release of sGP. It also did not affect its anti-inflammatory function but may impact on another as of yet unidentified sGP function. C-mannosylation involves the covalent attachment of an \u03b1-mannopyranosyl residue to the indole C2 carbon atom of Trp via a C-C linkage (Hofsteenge et al., 1994) . This modification was first described for W 7 of human RNase 2 (Hofsteenge et al., 1994) . C-mannosylation has been shown to be part of the normal biosynthetic pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans, amphibians, birds and mammals but does not appear to occur in insect, plant, yeast or bacterial cells (Doucey et al., 1998; Krieg et al., 1997) . The linear recognition sequence consists of W-x-x-W/F, in which the first Trp residue becomes mannosylated (Doucey et al., 1998) . Replacement of the second Trp with a Phe residue reduces the efficiency of C-mannosylation 3.5-fold (Krieg et al., 1998) . The C-mannosylation synthesis pathway, which appears to be enzymatically catalyzed by proteins present in liver microsomes (Doucey et al., 1998; Krieg et al., 1998) , has been dissected and is as follows: Mannose (Man) \u2192 \u2192 GDP-Man \u2192 Dolichylphosphate-Man (Dol-P-Man) \u2192 (C2-Man-Trp) (Doucey et al., 1998) .",

Proteins that contain C-mannosylation serve a variety of cellular functions and include extracellular matrix proteins, axonal guidance proteins, proteins involved in angiogenesis, metalloproteases and a number of proteins from the complement system, including properdin and the terminal complement components C6 to C9. It appears that for RNase2, as well as the six polypeptides from the complement system, the hydrophilic mannose residue fills a cavity formed by the main and side chain atoms of a loop on an exposed region of the protein, thus playing a structural role (Mosimann et al., 1996) . It has also been suggested that the C-mannose may be involved in protein transport as mutations in the W-x-x-W motif of the erythropoietin receptor and MP20 (a bovine lens protein that is C-mannosylated at W 43 and W 61 ) stall the transport of these proteins in the ER-Golgi interface or the ER, respectively (Hilton et al., 1996; Perez-Vilar et al., 2004) .

This finally provided us with a functional assay system for sGP that was recently used to demonstrate that the activity of sGP is critically dependent on its structure as maintained by correct intermolecular disulphide bonding (Falzarano et al., 2006) . Here we introduced a point mutation into sGP that is sufficient to abolish C-mannosylation and thus may alter the structure of sGP. However, our investigations did not reveal changes in the biosynthesis, transport, structure or function of the mutant sGP-WXXA compared to wild-type sGP (Figs. 3 and  4) . Moreover, the potential anti-inflammatory effect of sGP (Wahl-Jensen et al., 2005) might not be the sole function, as it has been suggested by others that sGP may play a role in immune evasion by acting as a decoy molecule for EBOV-specific humoral immune responses or bind to neutrophils and subsequently inhibit their activation (Ito et al., 2001; Yang et al., 1998) . Unfortunately, these proposed functions have been difficult to prove directly.",

With this in mind, the modification of sGP may be an anomaly resulting from the unique manner in which this protein is generated as the product of unedited transcripts from the glycoprotein gene of EBOV (Feldmann et al., 2001) . While not excluding a role of C-mannosylation on sGP function, it could be that C-mannosylation may impact on the function of the EBOV transmembrane glycoprotein GP 1,2 . This protein contains multiple potential C-mannosylation sites with two located adjacent to the predicted transmembrane region of GP 2 and one on W 288 of GP 1 , which is identical to the one on sGP. The location of a C-mannose on the extracellular portion near the membrane is not unprecedented as bovine lens protein MP20 also contains this modification in a similar location (Perez-Vilar et al., 2004) . The location of a C-mannosylation site just inside the transmembrane region of the BDV G and on the extracellular portion of the VSV G may further indicate that this modification is important for the orientation of membrane proteins or trafficking of viral membrane proteins to the cell surface, as has been suggested for C-mannosylated mammalian proteins (Ervin et al., 2005; Hilton et al., 1996) . Alternatively, Cmannosylation of viral proteins could also be a chance event due to the parasitic nature of mammalian viruses that highjack the cellular machinery to complete their life cycle; however, we find this unlikely.",

(B) Spectrum demonstrating that the fragment of sGP-WXXA mutated to prevent C-mannosylation does not contain a peak shift of +162 Da. Respective peaks of m/z 2020.988 (VNPEIDTTIGEWAFAETK) and 2149.073 (VNPEIDTTIGEWAFAETKK) are separated by 128.085 (one Lys residue). (C) MS/MS spectrum of C-mannosylated peptide m/z 2298. The y-series of ions from the fragmentation of the (277-294) VNPEIDTTIGEWAFWETK peptide are shown as well as the characteristic 120-Da loss from the parent peptide. The difference of 348.138 Da between the y 6 and y 7 ions corresponds to the 288-tryptophan residue with a mannose attached (186.079 + 162.053 = 348.132).",
