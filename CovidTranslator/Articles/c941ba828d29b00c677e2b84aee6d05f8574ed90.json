            "text": "In the preceding chapters, authors have discussed the various important aspects of the clinical asthma assessment. As is the case with assessing level of control, severity, and inflammation, identifying triggers for asthma is an integral part of the initial evaluation of newly diagnosed asthmatic individuals. Furthermore, reviewing potential asthma triggers at each follow-up visit helps educate asthma patients. This education is a preventative first step in identifying and modifying risk factors that are responsible for poor quality of life, unnecessary morbidity, and mortality. In this, the final chapter of Section III, we will review our current concepts of asthma triggers and their role in the assessment and management of asthma. We hope to organize the classification of asthma triggers, and provide quick reference tables to simplify the initial assessment and follow-up management of asthmatics. By the end of this chapter, you will be \"armed\" with the information to rapidly assess, educate, and intervene upon the asthma triggers that really matter.",

            "text": "What is an asthma trigger? Asthma triggers are any condition or stimuli that cause inflammation or hyperresponsiveness of the airways that result in the symptoms of asthma: wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and/or coughing. Given the heterogeneity of asthma phenotypes, it is important to understand that triggers will vary among patients. So focusing on the relevant triggers for each patient is of utmost importance. While some asthmatic individuals are atopic, others are not. Accordingly, while allergen avoidance may vastly help the so-called \"extrinsic\" asthmatic individual by preventing morbidity and exacerbations, exposure to aeroallergens may not be detrimental to the nonatopic, \"intrinsic\" asthmatic individual (Box 17-1). Furthermore, even within the group of atopic asthmatic individuals, some will be sensitized to seasonal allergens (trees, grasses, or weeds), while others will be triggered by perennial allergens (cat, dog, or dust mites). Given we have little, precious time at every patient encounter, it is imperative that we have a systematic approach to assessing and intervening upon asthma triggers targeted to the individual patient (Box 17-2). Accordingly, asthma triggers can be conveniently placed into groups by etiology: allergens, irritants, medications, weather changes, infections, emotions, gastroesophageal reflux, foods, and exercise (Table 17 -1).",

Even though whole pollen grains are quite large, plants can extrude allergen-containing particles that are less than 10 \u03bcm in size through the pores in their outer covering. This relatively small size likely facilitates entry into the lower airways, and results in the aforementioned allergic cascade with subsequent inflammation. The presence and time of release of these airborne allergens vary according to location and climate. Generally speaking, tree pollen is released first, in the springtime; grasses come later in the spring and early summer; and weed pollen arrives in late summer and early fall lasting until the first frost. Accordingly, pollen-allergic patients can have significant asthma exacerbations during their specific pollen season or seasons. Exposure to seasonal pollens is classically Box 17-2 Assessment considered an outdoor exposure, with peak outdoor pollen concentrations occurring in the morning. Unfortunately, during the grass pollen season, pollen can be found indoors at high levels in bedding, furniture, and carpeting. This is facilitated by leaving home windows open and using window and attic fans to cool the inside environment. To minimize morbidity, asthma patients should be educated about their specific pollen sensitivities and corresponding \"high-risk\" seasons, as avoidance is the best way for patients to reduce risk of asthma flare. Decreasing exposure and, in turn, asthma exacerbations can be facilitated by remaining indoors, closing windows, avoiding the use of cooling fans, and using car and home air-conditioning as much as possible. This is particularly important in the early morning, the time of peak airborne pollen concentration. Early morning outdoor exercise should be strictly avoided, as the combination of peak pollen counts and cardiovascular exercise with increased oxygen demand, increased respiratory rate, and larger tidal volumes can be a dangerous combination. Recognizing that complete avoidance is not always feasible, using locally available pollen counts to help inform patients of potential high-exposure days can be quite helpful in reducing allergen exposure.",

Fel d 1 is produced in the sebaceous glands and is typically spread via contact with cat saliva, dander, and urine. Common allergens are present in all breeds of cat (including lions, tigers, and hairless cats), but males produce more allergen than females. Cat allergen can be very small (<3 to 4 \u03bcm), and the distribution in the household air at any time is highly variable. Cat allergen is also very light and sticky, so it becomes airborne easily and can accumulate on household furniture, carpeting, and walls. These unique characteristics allow it to remain suspended in the air for long periods and to be inhaled deeply into the lungs, possibly accounting for its greater potential to trigger asthma symptoms than other aeroallergens. The level of cat allergen that is required to induce asthma symptoms is not well defined, so strict avoidance and proper cleaning after an animal has been removed from the household are key to preventing morbidity. Cat allergen levels drop slowly after animal removal, so brief trials of cat avoidance are useless. In fact, it takes approximately 5 months for cat allergen to drop to levels similar to those found in homes without cats, and 4 to 6 months after the animal has been removed for asthma patients to achieve any improvement in symptoms. Unfortunately, the clothes of cat owners constitute the vehicle of passive transport of Fel d 1 to cat-free environments, so recontamination to some extent is unavoidable.",

            "text": "House-dust mite levels vary with humidity, temperature, season, and type of home furnishings. The most important factor influencing growth of house-dust mites is humidity. Asthmatic patients who are mite-sensitive and live in environments with suitable sites for mite growth (e.g., wall-to-wall or bedroom carpeting and upholstered or overstuffed furniture) are at greater risk in more humid climates. House-dust mites optimally reproduce in bedding and carpeting where the relative humidity in the home is higher than 50%. Accordingly, improper setting of the central air humidifier (commonly part of a home's central heating and air-conditioning unit) may worsen asthma control; while dehumidifiers set to keep humidity levels lower than 50% may be beneficial in reducing asthma symptoms from house-dust mite exposure. Although using other environmental control measures to minimize dust mite exposure are generally endorsed by allergists as a preventative first step to reduce asthma flares, studies examining their use are conflicting and have provided much controversy. Some studies using relatively basic dust mite control measures have shown no effect on asthma symptoms or reduction in mite growth; whereas other studies that use methods of extensive cleaning and dust mite proofing (e.g., mattress and pillow covers) to minimize mite exposure have been associated with a reduction in asthmatic symptoms, medication use, and morbidity. Furthermore, some studies have shown that patients exposed to lower levels of house-dust mites not only have decreased asthma symptoms and medication use, but also have improvement in nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Having said this, the Cochrane Library meta-analysis on house-dust mite control measures for asthma, including 49 trials that examined the use of physical, chemical, and combination methods to reduce house-dust mite exposure, showed no benefit/effect on frequently reported outcomes (am peak flow, asthma symptom scores, and medication use). The reviewers mention that many of the trials included in this analysis were of poor quality, making their conclusions difficult to interpret. If environmental control measures are suggested, the bedroom is the most important room to target, as most of our day in the home (approximately 8 to 10 hours during the night for sleep) is spent there. Other areas of the home, such as the living or family room that contains overstuffed furniture or carpeting, must be considered as potential sites of significant house-dust mite exposure. Proposed environmental controls to be considered include replacing wall-to-wall carpeting with hardwood or vinyl flooring, encasing bedding in dust-mite impermeable material, frequent dusting (with mask or by an unaffected individual), replacing upholstered/overstuffed furniture with leather furniture, replacing fabric curtains with blinds, washing bedding weekly in hot water (60\u00b0 C or 130\u00b0 F), washing and high-heat drying or freezing of stuffed toys, reducing humidity to less than 50%, frequent vacuuming (with HEPA filter and doublethickness bags) by an individual not sensitive to dust mites (or with mask), and using acaricides and/or tannic acid to mitigate house-dust mite infestation.",

The ability of cockroach allergen to stimulate the formation of specific IgE antibodies has been demonstrated by end point skin test titration and radioallergosorbent testing. Furthermore, a causal relationship between bronchospasm and sensitivity to cockroach allergen has been proved in bronchial provocation studies. Positive skin tests to cockroach allergen are reportedly present in 20% to 53% of allergic patients and as high as 49% to 61% of asthmatic patients. Although there are about 50 species of cockroaches that live in the United States, only 3 have been shown to induce allergen-specific IgE: the American, German, and Asian/Oriental cockroaches. Cockroach allergen usually is found in kitchen cabinets and kitchen floor dust, as they usually hide out in cabinets and behind refrigerators. A study in urban asthmatic patients has shown that cockroach sensitivity may be as important a risk factor for inner-city asthmatic individuals as house-dust mite allergy. Because elimination of cockroach infestation requires aggressive, repeated extermination efforts with irritant chemicals (deltamethrin powder or cypermethrin), it is best performed by professional exterminators. Cockroach baits and gels (fipronil and hydramethylnon) can be purchased at local superstores. These are generally safer and relatively nontoxic to mammals (pets and children), but may not be as effective in cases of severe infestation.

The amount of indoor mold in any dwelling depends on several important factors: age and composition of the structure, type of heating and cooling system, and use of humidifiers. Dark and humid (often poorly ventilated) basements are ideal sites for mold growth. The next most common sites of mold growth are the bathroom and the kitchen. In tropical and subtropical climates, fungi may grow on the walls of the house as a result of water seepage and humidity. To avoid this, the walls can be tiled or cleaned as necessary. Home heating, cooling, and humidification systems are also potential sources of fungal growth, although air-conditioning generally reduces indoor humidity and hence discourages mold growth. Most fungal spores in an indoor environment are nonviable spores that will be found in house-dust reservoirs such as carpeting, bedding, and furniture. Implementing the same precautions used to reduce levels of dust mites is the best way to eliminate mold spores from the home. Levels of viable indoor mold spores can be reduced by removing or cleaning mold-laden objects. Levels may also be reduced by use of dehumidifiers (set humidity level < 50%) in the basement and air-conditioners in the bedroom or family room. Air-conditioners and dehumidifiers reduce humidity and filter large fungal spores, lowering the mold and yeast count indoors, although their benefit in reducing asthma symptoms is controversial. Home humidifiers should be used with caution and cleaned frequently because of the potential for mold and Actinomyces growth. Bathrooms and kitchens should be well ventilated. Electronic air filters also lower the level of mold spores within a dwelling. When the major source of molds within a home is a wet or damp cellar, the basement should be kept free of carpeting, immediately dried out after a rainstorm, and, whenever possible, protected with a drain tile and sump pump.",

As with all other asthma triggers, each should be identified and meticulously eliminated or avoided. Active and passive tobacco cigarette smoke, consisting of very small, light particles that remain airborne for long periods, is a high-risk trigger for all asthmatic individuals. Studies have demonstrated that children may be at increased risk of developing asthma and allergic sensitization when exposed to passive smoke. Other studies in children show worsening asthma symptom severity, higher medication requirements, more frequent emergency department visits, and increased airway responsiveness when exposed to passive maternal tobacco smoke. Active cigarette smoking not only has direct, deleterious effects on the lung parenchyma, it also reduces the efficacy of inhaled and systemic corticosteroids. Thus, smoking cessation must be a primary objective for the patient, friends, and family members of asthmatic patients. Other forms of smoke, such as that of wood-burning stoves, also have negative effects on the lower respiratory tract. Additional airborne irritants, fumes, and strong odors (e.g., chalk dust, talcum powder, paint fumes, insecticides, household cleaning sprays, polishes, cooking oil fumes, perfumes, and cosmetics) may initiate or exacerbate asthmatic symptoms in some patients. Other indoor pollutants include carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, nitric oxide, nitrogen oxides, and bacterial endotoxin. In all of these cases, adequate ventilation plays a pivotal role in successful prevention of asthma symptoms, as air stagnation has been shown to be a surrogate marker for the accumulation of indoor pollutants.

Studies have implicated several outdoor pollutants as potential triggers of asthma symptoms. Air pollutants such as ozone, nitrogen oxides, acidic aerosols, and particulate matter can lead to asthma symptoms and frank exacerbations. Other important outdoor asthma triggers include exposure to vehicle traffic (especially diesel exhaust), which might exacerbate preexisting allergic conditions by enhancing airway responses to allergen, a potential compounding effect. On occasion, weather and atmospheric conditions create brief periods of intense air pollution in a defined geographic area. At these and other times and in areas of high outdoor pollution, patients with asthma should avoid unnecessary outdoor physical activity (especially exercise) and try to stay indoors in a clean environment. As with pollen and aeroallergens, air-conditioning and filters may be helpful in preventing unnecessary morbidity. When working outdoors in polluted areas is unavoidable, taking a preventative, short-acting inhaled bronchodilator beforehand may prevent acute asthma symptoms. If prolonged outdoor polluted conditions are likely to persist, it is a good idea to tell patients to leave the polluted area before mild symptoms spiral into an acute asthma flare.",

One can access a fairly comprehensive list of potential occupational asthma triggers at http://asmanet.com. An overview of these triggers and occupational asthma is covered in Chapter 42. Levels of exposure above which sensitization occurs have been proposed for many chemicals, so primary prevention is possible with proper precautionary measures. However, once a patient has been sensitized, the level of exposure necessary to induce symptoms may be very low, and resulting exacerbations may become progressively severe on reexposure. Attempts to reduce occupational exposure have been successful, especially in the industrial setting, where potent sensitizers have been replaced by less allergenic or sensitizing substances. For example, primary prevention of latex allergy has been very successful. This has been accomplished by producing powder-free, lower allergen-content gloves. In cases where prevention is not possible, the early identification of occupational sensitizers and the removal of affected patients from these environments are critical to the successful management of occupational asthma.",

Patients sensitive to aspirin usually are reactive to all other NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen), and variations in the frequency and severity of adverse responses appear to depend on the potency of each drug within this class of compounds to inhibit the activity of the COX-1 enzyme. Sensitivity to NSAIDs is not IgE-mediated and involves the modulation of eicosanoid production. NSAIDs likely act by reducing the formation of prostaglandins that help maintain normal airway function while increasing the formation of asthma-provoking eicosanoids, including hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids and cysteinyl leukotrienes. Thus, if aspirin-sensitive asthmatic individuals require treatment with an NSAID, the use of a selective COX-2 inhibitor is a viable treatment option, especially when combined with an inhibitor of leukotriene synthesis or leukotriene receptor antagonist. In addition, there is evidence that mast cell activation occurs, and its mediators can be detected in nasal secretions during an episode of aspirin-induced asthma. This syndrome should be of concern in any asthmatic patient with nasal polyposis, chronic sinusitis, and eosinophilia, although nasal polyposis and sinusitis may precede the onset of recognized NSAID-sensitivity by years. b-Blockers administered either orally or via eye drops (for hypertension or glaucoma, respectively) may exacerbate asthma symptoms via bronchospasm. As a general rule, these medications should be not be used by asthmatic individuals, as other classes of drugs may be used to successfully treat these underlying comorbidities. If b-blockers are used, close medical supervision is essential to prevent unnecessary morbidity. As is the case with all of the aforementioned asthma triggers, avoidance is the treatment of choice.",

For example, pollen and mold counts have seasonal patterns and release of these allergens is highly dependent upon \"proper\" environmental conditions to allow successful release and plant pollination/procreation. As aforementioned, it is well recognized that exposure to molds or pollens during a particular season can induce asthmatic attacks in sensitized (allergic) individuals, so any atmospheric change (seasonal change or sudden gust of wind) that increases exposure to these allergens is potentially detrimental to allergensensitized asthmatic individuals.

Studies have shown conflicting results on whether lower esophageal acidification can act as a trigger for asthma. In fact, asthma might precipitate GERD symptoms; thus, a temporal association between the two does not establish that GERD triggers asthma. Randomized trials investigating different treatment modalities for GERD in asthma have been conducted to determine whether treatment of GERD improves asthma symptoms and outcomes. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that therapy for GERD, including acid-suppressive treatment with a proton-pump or histamine-2 receptor antagonists, does not consistently improve lung function, asthma symptoms, nocturnal asthma, or lessen the use of asthma medications. Littner and colleagues showed that in adult patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma and symptoms of acid reflux, treatment with 30 mg of lansoprazole twice daily for 24 weeks did not improve asthma symptoms, pulmonary function, or reduce albuterol use. However, this dose significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and improved quality of life, particularly in those patients receiving more than one asthma-controller medication. With all of this being considered, untreated GERD symptoms may affect airway reactivity in patients with asthma.

Food additives that have been implicated include salicylates, food preservatives, monosodium glutamate, and some food-coloring agents. Sodium metabisulfite, a preservative in many beverages (including beer and wine) and foods, is thought to release sufficient sulfur dioxide to provoke bronchoconstriction. For some people, eating a particular food (common culprits include milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish) can trigger asthma symptoms.

Win, MD.)Figure 17-2 intradermal skin testing (using a 25G 5/8 needle) to weeds on a young asthmatic male who reported itchy, watery eyes, nasal congestion, and worsening shortness of breath and wheeze in the fall. After epicutaneous skin testing revealed only minimal sensitivities to trees and grasses, intradermal skin testing (more sensitive) revealed strong cutaneous reactions to multiple weeds. With the patient's history of worsening symptoms in the fall, this testing provided a better explanation for his worsening seasonal symptoms. Although the patient displayed multiple positive intradermal tests, he was clearly not allergic to lamb's quarters (labeled \"6\"). (Courtesy of Patrick H. Win, MD.)",
