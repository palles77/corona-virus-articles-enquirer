This study aimed to identify the incidence of hyponatraemia in cases of CAP, to find predictive tools in order to classify the severity and outcome of CAP and to explore possible differences of clinical importance between the two sexes. Material and methods: The medical files of 54 children (66.4% males), 4.67 \u00b12.88 years old, were retro-prospectively reviewed. Results: 35/54 (64.8%) children with pneumonia had normal values of sodium at admission, 18/54 (33.3%) had mild hyponatraemia and 1 child (1.9%) moderate hyponatraemia. Increased heart rhythm and tachypnoea at admission were correlated with lower values of sodium (z = -2.664, p = 0.007 and z = -1.705, p = 0.089 respectively). No differences were found between the two sexes concerning the characteristics of pneumonia or the range of sodium in serum at admission. A correlation was found between sodium admission values and: a) C-reactive protein (p = 0.000), and b) leukocyte count (p = 0.006). Sedimentation rate (p = 0.021) was also considered as a possible risk factor affecting the value of sodium at admission to hospital. Finally, a negative association was also observed between the degree of hyponatraemia and the duration of hospitalization (z = -3.398, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Although studies in larger population groups are needed, in our study increased heart rhythm, tachypnoea, leucocyte count, C-reactive protein, and also erythrocyte sedimentation rate could be considered as possible risk factors influencing the degree of hyponatraemia, and thus the outcome of hospitalized children with CAP.",

Secretion of anti-diuretic hormone typically results in water retention with minimal weight gain, usually with no oedema formation, and normal blood pressure [10] . According to studies, SIADH occurs in about one third of children hospitalized for pneumonia, and was associated with a more severe disease and a poorer outcome [10] . Few studies exist concerning the correlation of HN and pneumonia in children. It was first described by Stormont and Waterhouse in 1962 [17] . Since then and during the past 35 years, only case reports and a few relevant studies on the association between HN and pneumonia have been published, of which only three concern children [10, 18, 19] . Community-acquired (CAP) and nosocomial pneumonias contribute substantially to morbidity and hospital resource utilization [20, 21] . Hyponatraemia, occurring in more than 1/4 of patients with CAP, is associated with greater disease severity and worsened outcomes [20] .",
