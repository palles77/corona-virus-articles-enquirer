The virus is now recognized as a leading cause of childhood respiratory tract infection across the globe. By age 3, nearly all children will have been infected by the virus. HRSV is a member of the Orthopneumovirus genus within the family Pneumoviridae of the Mononegavirales order. Viruses within the Mononegavirales order have a nonsegmented, negative sense, single stranded RNA genome (Table 1 ). The HRSV genome is approximately 15.2 kilobases in size, comprising 10 genes, which encode 11 proteins (for a schematic view of the genome organization, see Fig. 1 ). HRSV virions are pleomorphic particles, with either spherical or filamentous forms, around 120-200 nm in size. Virions are encased in a host-derived lipid bilayer, from which three viral proteins protrude; F, G and SH. Within the virion, the genome is bound to the viral nucleoprotein (N) in a ribonuclear protein (RNP) complex. Similar to other negative sense RNA viruses, HRSV particles carry an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (L). The virion also contains the phosphoprotein (P) and the matrix protein (M2-1).",

G is responsible for receptor binding, but infection is possible in the absence of this protein, albeit it at lower efficiency. F is a type I fusion protein and is essential for infection. The precise cellular receptor for HRSV has been debated, with heparan sulfate been suggested for many years. More recent work has suggested that this receptor was an artifact of working with immortalized cell lines, and that the receptor on more physiologically relevant human airway epithelial cells is the chemokine receptor CX3CR1, which is found exclusively on the apical surface of these cells. The precise trigger for F-mediated membrane fusion is unknown, but is pH-independent because when F is expressed at the plasma membrane of cells it can cause syncytia formation at neutral pH. This syncytia formation is characteristic of HRSV infection and is from where the virus' name is derived. HRSV is generally thought to fuse with the plasma membrane, although there have also been suggestions that the virus is internalized through macropinocytosis prior to fusion with an endosomal membrane. Once membrane fusion is completed the viral genome is deposited to the cytosol. The negative sense RNA genome is transcribed by the actions of the L, P, N and M2-1, giving a set of mRNAs to direct the synthesis of viral proteins. The viral mRNAs are produced in a gradient with decreasing amounts of transcript to the 3 0 end of the genome. The genes transcribed from the 5 0 end at the highest abundance are the nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2 that function to suppress the innate immune response of the infected cell. Over time, the polymerase complex switches from producing mRNA transcripts to producing fulllength copies of the viral genome, the antigenome. This switch is in part regulated by the M2-2 protein. The antigenome is used as a template to direct replication of the negative sense genome that associates with N to form the RNP complex.

In polarized epithelial cells virion release is directed toward the apical plasma membrane (for a schematic view of the life cycle, see Fig. 2 ). Along with directing viral entry into cells, F and G are the main proteins presented to the immune system. HRSV is divided into two serotypes, group A and B, largely based on differences in the G protein, and the differing antibody responses this produces. Within these serotypes there are various genotypes. Group A has 11 genotypes, GA1-7, NA1, NA2, SAA1 and ON1, while group B has 23 genotypes, GB1-4, SAB1-4, URU1, URU2, BA1-12 and THB. Both serotypes and multiple genotypes have been found to co-circulate, although often one serotype will be dominant in a given season. It is thought this genetic and serological diversity is a major reason for the abundance of re-infection throughout life and lack of prolonged immunity. (1) HRSV attaches to cell surface receptors and has pH-independent fusion. It is generally thought that HRSV fusion occurs at the cell surface, but may also be within endosomes. Some members of the Paramyxoviridae have receptor-mediated endocytic uptake and fuse at internal membrane sites (as is depicted in the Coronaviridae life cycle).

Approximately a third of patients infected with HRSV will progress to LRTI. The most common presentation of LRTI in infants is bronchiolitis, but pneumonia and croup are also seen. The virus replicates in epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract causing necrosis of ciliated cells, syncytia formation, peribronchiolar inflammation and impairment of secretion, all of which play a role in airway obstruction and lung hyperinflation, typical of bronchiolitis. HRSV infection is particularly severe in infants because their under-developed lungs are unable to compensate for the damage induced by viral replication and the inflammatory response. Re-infection usually displays reduced severity of disease. In healthy adults, infection usually causes mild, nonspecific features of viral URTI, such as coryza, sore throat, fever and malaise. In the elderly, immunocompromised or those with underlying health conditions, the symptoms are often more severe.",

To date, very few protective factors have been found, although breast feeding, and the level of maternally derived antibodies correlate with a decreased likelihood of hospitalization. There is debate over whether there are any viral determinants of disease severity. Various studies suggest that serotype A viruses are more virulent, while others suggest serotype B causes more severe disease. Other studies show no particular impact of viral serotype on disease severity. However, it is established that a higher viral load is associated with increased risk of severe disease; a higher viral load on day 3 of hospitalization was found to be associated with an increased risk of admittance to the intensive care unit (ICU) and respiratory failure.",

Following the interaction of the four structural proteins and the viral genome, there is inward budding of cellular membrane to the ERGIC to produce a virion. These virions then exit the cell through the Golgi exocytic pathway and fusion of a cellular vesicle at the plasma membrane.

One of these patients traveled to Hanoi, Vietnam and was responsible for a hospital-based outbreak of 38 cases.

Within weeks of the transmission out of Hong Kong, SARS-CoV had spread to 27 countries and infected thousands of people, with about a third being healthcare workers. The virus responsible for SARS was identified in April 2003. By July 2003, the outbreak was halted through public health measures, although a handful of additional cases were detected in December 2003 to January 2004.

EV71 utilizes P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 and scavenger receptor class B member 2 as receptors for infection. EV71 is best known for causing hand-foot-mouth disease, largely in the Asia-Pacific region, and in some cases severe neurological symptoms. However, the virus is also associated with respiratory disease such as pharyngitis, bronchiolitis, croup and pneumonia, mostly in young children.",

            "text": "Respiratory viruses are the most frequent causes of human disease worldwide. Each year, this broad group of pathogens is responsible for a huge number of deaths and economic loss through days of sickness. Moreover, owing to the nature of respiratory transmission, this category of viruses has the potential for wide-ranging spread. SARS-CoV, a virus that reached 27 countries within a matter of weeks, highlights the explosive outbreak potential of respiratory pathogens. Emergence of novel respiratory viruses carries with it the fear of pandemic disease spread. To date there is generally a lack of antiviral therapy or vaccination against any of these viruses, further fueling fears for far reaching spread. By developing a deeper understanding of how these viruses replicate, cause disease and transmit, we will be able to be prepared for, and counter, the next great pandemic respiratory virus.",
