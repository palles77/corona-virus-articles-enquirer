The emergency department (ED) at Texas Children's Hospital has participated in disaster management in the past, most notably in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina by creating and implementing a mobile pediatric emergency response team (MPERT). Ultimately, it doubled its capacity and during a 13-day period provided medical care to more than 3,500 pediatric Hurricane Katrina victims housed in the Astrodome. 2 The surge capacity of the ED again was tested in late April of 2009 by H1N1 swine influenza. The unique challenges of dealing with a novel influenza strain with pandemic potential would require triaging and surge potential planning of a very different kind than had previously been used for natural disasters. According to the surge potential of this event and the success of MPERT post-Hurricane Katrina, MPERT was implemented onsite in an open-air parking lot located fewer than 50 feet from the entrance to the Texas Children's Hospital ED.",

Chairs in waiting areas were kept 3 feet apart to minimize disease transmission. A video with discharge instructions specific to viral respiratory illnesses was played in English and Spanish in waiting rooms. The video was created by the ED staff in response to family queries. Three portable restrooms, modular sinks, alcohol-based cleaner dispensers, tissue paper, and waste receptacles were readily available. Modular sinks were part of hospital supplies; the restrooms were rented from private vendors. N95 respirators were available for staff, and surgical masks were available for children and their guardians. There is evidence that heat and humidity may help prevent the spread of droplets. 7 However, because the average high temperature in Houston in May is 85\u00b0F, with 65% to 91% humidity, 8 the importance of cooling was recognized at the outset. Cooling units were placed in each examination room and several were distributed in the waiting areas. The need to balance personal comfort against airborne transmission led to placing the cooling ductwork over the heads of the health care workers, pointed in the direction of patients.

This decompression of the higher-acuity areas of the ED would have been even more important for influenza with greater morbidity and mortality. Also, the use of an outdoor ED might not be feasible in inclement weather. Although many aspects of MPERT worked well, there remain a few areas for improvement. Work duties must be clearly delineated because personnel often were asked to perform outside their normal roles. One of the advantages of MPERT was the ability to rapidly change processes; however, new algorithms needed to be created and conveyed to the rotating staff. Sustaining the efficient flow of patients through MPERT required reinforcement and continued communication of process changes. A current process manual with delegation of responsibilities would have helped maintain uniformity of procedures.

MPERT was developed to provide a readily available specialized regional resource that could be mobilized whenever and wherever needed. Resource utilization and reallocation allowed for a rapid, cohesive institutional response. The ability to quickly respond to a dynamic situation was possible because of experiences dealing with mass casualty situations and a physical infrastructure that could be adapted for a new functionality. The hospital experience with pediatric Hurricane Katrina evacuees identified several areas of improvement: cohorting for infectious diseases, improving communication, and streamlining processes. 2 These were addressed before the start of this MPERT. The need to identify venues for obtaining emergency stocks of supplies (eg, rapid influenza testing kits) also was recognized. One possibility would have been contacting the regional hospital preparedness council's Catastrophic Medical Operations Center. The center was used after Hurricane Katrina to coordinate regional resources, avoid duplication of requests, and streamline processes. 12 The unique circumstances of the threat of pandemic influenza necessitated a novel strategy in the ED because of increasing patient volumes and infection control concerns. The epicenter of the 1988 to 1989 Houston measles epidemic was the Texas Children's Hospital ED waiting room. 13 The threat of another airborne pathogen led to the decisions to perform active surveillance for symptoms, using a screening questionnaire, and to screen patients outdoors. The infection control challenge was to keep care areas safe for staff and patients. Although the community could practice social distancing, we could not; in fact, ill children actively sought out our facility. We performed social distancing through infection control techniques: active screening for symptoms, isolation, contact precautions, and use of N95 respirators.",

As a result, the decision was made to screen patients outdoors. This strategy was based on the Toronto experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome. The Toronto hospitals began screening patients before entry into the hospital to enable appropriate cohorting and to minimize risk to their staff. 15, 16 This strategy was particularly attractive at Texas Children's Hospital, where the ED is across a covered breezeway from an open-air parking lot. This setup provided all the advantages of ventilation while retaining proximity to the remainder of the ED. The warmth and humidity of Houston were very useful in this regard because influenza virions do not remain airborne for long periods under these conditions. 7 Social distancing measures were also adapted for the realities of an ED waiting room. This involved separation of chairs, cohorting patients by symptoms, and provision of facemasks. Respiratory etiquette stations were created and stocked with antiseptic hand wash, tissues, and waste receptacles. Finally, patients were allowed to have only 1 parent or guardian enter MPERT. Keeping patients in the appropriate areas was facilitated by the use of color-coded wristbands and by creating incentives for parents and children to keep their wristbands in place.",
