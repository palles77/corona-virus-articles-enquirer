The entire ORF3 genes of 12 PEDV field strains and one vaccine strain were sequenced. The ORF3 genes of Chinese PEDV field strains (excluding CH/GSJIII/07) contain a single 672-or 675-nucleotide (nt) ORF, which encodes a 223-or 224-aa-long peptide. However, the CV777 vaccine strain and CH/GSJIII/07 contain a 276-nt ORF because of a 49-nt deletion at nt 245-293. The Chinese PEDV field strains and PEDV reference strains are divided into three groups based on the phylogenetic relationship of their ORF3 genes. Chinese PEDV field strains (excluding CH/GSJIII/07) have a close phylogenetic relationship to Korean strains and are genetically different from the PEDV vaccine strains. However, CH/GSJIII/07 has a close phylogenetic relationship to two vaccine strains, suggesting that it might have evolved from a live vaccine strain. Chinese PEDV field strains (excluding CH/GSJIII/07) can be differentiated from PEDV vaccine strains by a nested RT-PCR method.",

The size of its genome is approximately 28 kb. Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), caused by PEDV, is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease that is characterized by severe enteritis, vomiting and watery diarrhea in swine. PED was firstly reported in the UK in 1971, and the virus was firstly identified during episodes of epizootic diarrhea in Belgium and the UK in 1978 [1] . This disease has subsequently been reported in many other swine-producing countries in Europe and Asia [2] .",

These genes are called accessory genes. Whereas the genes encoding the structural proteins have been thoroughly investigated for most coronaviruses, little is known about the accessory genes. Reverse genetic analyses of mouse hepatits virus (MHV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) have suggested that these genes are not required for virus replication. Moreover, deletion of MHV and FIPV accessory genes results in attenuation in their respective hosts, indicating that the accessory genes represent pathogenicity factors [6] [7] [8] . It has been shown that virulence of TGEV and PEDV can be reduced by altering the ORF3 gene through cell-culture adaptation [9, 10] , and ORF3 has been suggested to be an important determinant for the virulence of these viruses. ORF3 is the only accessory gene in the PEDV genome. Differentiation of ORF3 genes between the highly Vero-cell-adapted viruses and field virus could be a marker of adaptation to cell culture and a valuable tool for molecular epidemiologic studies of PEDV infections [10] .",

The recent Chinese field strains (excluding CH/GSJIII/07) have 97.6-100% DNA sequence identity to each other. They share more than 97.2% DNA sequence identity with Korean field strains (Chinju99, DR13). However, they have 96.6-97.6% DNA sequence identity to CV777 vaccine strain, less than 95.9% DNA sequence homology to Chinese stain LZC and less than 97.2% DNA sequence identity to the European field strains (CV777, Br1/87). The deduced amino acid sequences of the recent Chinese field strains (excluding CH/GSJIII/07) have 96.4-100% homology to each other and more than 95.2% to those of Korean strains (Chinju99, DR13 and attenuated DR13). They have less than 94.6% homology to the deduced amino acid sequences of two European strains (CV777, Br1/87) and one Chinese strain (LZC). CH/GSJIII/07 has 99.0% DNA sequence homology with CV777 vaccine strain and 100% homology to the deduced amino acid sequence of the CV777 vaccine strain.",

All of the ORF3 genes of the Chinese PEDV field strains and the CV777 vaccine strain have a sequence (CTAGAC) of 46 nucleotides upstream of the initiator ATG, as already recognized in a previous study [13] . This sequence is a hexameric motif common to coronaviruses and is similar to the hexameric motifs XUA(A/G)AC found adjacent to other PEDV ORFs.

However, variable region II is observed in the ORF3 genes of CH/GSJII/07 and CH/GSJIII/07. Both CH/GSJII/ 07 and CH/GSJIII/07 have a 3-nt deletion in variable region II (Fig. 2) . Both the CV777 vaccine strain and CH/ GSJIII/07 have a 49-nt deletion at nt 245-293. The large deletion is similar to the deletion in the ORF3 gene of attenuated DR13, which has a 51-nt deletion at nt 245-295 (Fig. 2) . Although they have 51-nt deletions in their ORF3 genes, attenuated-type PEDV strains, including attenuated DR13, KPED-9 and P-5V, contain a single 624-base ORF encoding a 224-aa-long peptide [15] . However, because of the large deletion, the CV777 vaccine strain and CH/ GSJIII/07 contain a truncated ORF, which consists of 276 nt and encodes a 91-aa-long peptide.",

Because detection of PEDV in feces might be affected by the reliability and sensitivity of the technique [16] , we have established a nested RT-PCR method using the deletion in the ORF3 gene of the CV777 vaccine strain. Because the sense primer ORF3U2 is located in the region that corresponds to the large deletions in the ORF3 genes of PEDV vaccine strains (Fig. 2) , the 149-bp PCR products could not be amplified by ORF3U2/ORF3L2 from CV777 vaccine strain when using the products amplified by ORF3U1/ORF3L1 as the templates. In this study, the 149-bp fragments of the CV777 vaccine strain and CH/GSJIII/07 were not amplified, while the corresponding fragments of other Chinese PEDV field strains were amplified by the nested RT-PCR (Fig. 1) .",

The Chinese PEDV field strains (excluding CH/GSJIII/07) are genetically different from the CV777 vaccine strain, which is used to prevent PEDV infection in China at present. There is a new genotype of PEDV prevailing in China that differs from the genotype of the vaccine strains. PEDV shedding may be variable, depending on the sensitivity of the detection tool. Moreover, shedding may be influenced by the viral strain employed. It has been reported that virus shedding in piglets inoculated with cell-adapted DR13 lasted for 7 or 8 days [10, 17] , while in sows, it persisted for 3 days [17] . CH/GSJIII/07 has the highest DNA sequence identity and a close phylogenetic relationship to the CV777 vaccine strain. It may have evolved from the vaccine strain under the immune pressure. However, further work will be required to determine whether this field strain is a variant of the CV777 vaccine strain.",
