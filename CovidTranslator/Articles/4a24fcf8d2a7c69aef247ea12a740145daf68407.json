            "text": "The ability to comprehensively characterize exposures and immune responses to viral infections will be critical to better understanding human health and disease. We previously described the VirScan system, a phage-display based technology for profiling antibody binding to a comprehensive library of peptides designed to represent the human virome. The previous VirScan analytical approach did not fully account for disproportionate representation of viruses in the library or for antibody cross-reactivity among sequences shared by related viruses. Here we present the 'AntiViral Antibody Response Deconvolution Algorithm' ('AVARDA'), a multi-module software package for analyzing VirScan datasets. AVARDA provides a probabilistic assessment of infection at species-level resolution by considering alignment of all library peptides to each other and to all human viruses. We employed AVARDA to analyze VirScan data from a cohort of encephalitis patients with either known viral infections or undiagnosed etiologies. By comparing acute and convalescent sera, AVARDA successfully confirmed or detected antibody responses to human herpesviruses 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, thereby improving the rate of diagnosing viral encephalitis in this cohort by 62.5%. We further assessed AVARDA's utility in the setting of an epidemiological study, demonstrating its ability to determine infections acquired in a child followed prospectively from infancy. We consider ways in which AVARDA's conceptual framework may be further developed in the future and describe how its analyses may be extended beyond investigations of viral infection. AVARDA, in combination with VirScan and other pan-pathogen serological techniques, is likely to find broad utility in the epidemiology and diagnosis of infectious diseases.",

            "text": "Our previously published analytical approach suffers from three critical limitations. First, the number of nonoverlapping, virus-associated antibody specificities (a measure of response \"breadth\") conveys important biological information and informs the confidence of a predicted exposure. Non-overlapping specificities were defined using a suboptimal heuristic that typically underestimated response breadth. Second, a significantly enriched peptide was considered only in the context of the specific virus it was designed to represent. This ignored sequence homology between related viruses, and any potential for antibody cross-reactivity. Further, the VirScan library was designed to cover single representative proteins from UniProt clusters of 90% identity. Relying solely upon the intended viral representations of enriched peptides to diagnose infections will therefore result in both false negative results (\"missing\" peptides from the true infective organism) and false positive results (peptide enrichments due to cross-reactive antibodies). Third, we previously relied on each virus's proteome \"size\" to establish virus-specific thresholds for seropositivity. This approach ignored the proportional representation of each virus within the enriched set of peptides and the corresponding virus-specific representation in the library. Additionally, using a threshold for seropositivity is far less informative than a probabilistic assessment of a viral infection.",

            "text": "Here we introduce the Anti-Viral Antibody Response Deconvolution Algorithm ('AVARDA'), an analytical framework for improved analysis of massively multiplexed anti-viral antibody binding data. AVARDA integrates three key modules to generate a conservative and probabilistic assessment of current and historical viral exposures. The first module employs a network graph based on peptide-peptide relationships to define the minimum number of independent antibody specificities (i.e. response breadth) required to completely explain the set of observed enriched peptides. The second module uses sequence alignment to define each peptide's relationship to a comprehensive database of all human viral genomes, which have been translated in all six reading frames. This permits a conservative consideration of all viral infections that could have potentially elicited the observed antibodies specificities, and conversely, which sets of peptide enrichments could potentially be associated with each virus. The third module iteratively assigns each peptide to its most likely associated viral infection(s), according to a null model that considers the representation of each virus in the VirScan library. Our approach permits peptides to be associated with multiple distinct infections, provided there is sufficient evidence for each viral infection on its own (i.e. in the absence of the shared peptides). AVARDA also indicates uncertainty in peptide-virus assignments when there is insufficient evidence to discriminate between infections by related viral candidates, but when there is enough evidence to conclude that an infection has indeed occurred. Linking these modules, the final output of AVARDA provides multiple hypothesis adjusted p-values for exposure to each virus, along with the associated breadths of the antibody responses and the relationships between the enriched peptides.",

An important example is the challenge of distinguishing between flavivirus infections, notably in the setting of the recent Zika virus outbreak 11 . Unbiased analysis of anti-viral antibodies using a robust algorithm that comprehensively considers potential cross-reactivity will dramatically improve the clinical utility of antibody analyses. Single time-point testing of IgG reactivity is difficult to interpret in the context of an ongoing or recent infection, as these antibodies may be due to long lived plasma cells induced by a historic infection. Quantifying an individual's change in IgG specificities over time, however, may provide clearer evidence of an evolving immune response. Similarly, comparing IgG specificities across distinct physiological compartments may provide evidence of an organ-specific infection (e.g., blood versus cerebrospinal fluid in the setting of encephalitis). Such pairwise VirScan comparisons would be particularly problematic for our previous analytical approach, because (i) a low number (but high proportion) of changing peptides may be observed during response to a single infection, and (ii) ongoing antibody responses may be more associated with broadly cross-reactive antibodies 12 . We have therefore developed the AVARDA algorithm using pairwise VirScan data generated longitudinally from patients with viral encephalitis. The predictions of the algorithm were found to agree with clinical nucleic acid or serology testing in most cases. In addition, utilizing VirScan/AVARDA analysis in conjunction with traditional nucleic acid testing resulted in a 62.5% increase in the diagnosis of viral encephalitis. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of AVARDA for epidemiological investigations by determining childhood infections acquired in the setting of a longitudinal cohort study.",

As a simple preliminary model, we assumed that two peptides sharing an exact sequence at least seven amino acids long could potentially be recognized by the same monoclonal antibody. Conversely, if two peptides were enriched and did not share a seven amino acid sequence, we assumed that their binding was due to at least two unique antibody clones.

For any set of enriched peptides, this database can be used to construct a network graph, such that peptides are represented by nodes and overlapping sequences are represented by edges connecting the nodes. Given a network of enriched peptides, we devised an iterative method to remove peptides until a maximal subset of unconnected peptides remains. This number of remaining peptides represents the minimum number of nonredundant antibody specificities required to produce the network, and can therefore be considered a conservative estimate of the antibody response breadth. In order to iteratively disconnect the graph, we remove the most connected peptide(s) one at a time. Ties are broken by favoring retention of more strongly enriched peptides, based on the assumption that these peptides are more likely to harbor cognate, versus cross reactive epitopes. This process is further described in our methods.

However, in order to exhaustively consider sequence similarity and thus potential for antibody cross reactivity, we have constructed a comprehensive genomic database of all known human viral species. To exclude any potential open reading frame (ORF) annotation bias, all VirScan peptide sequences were aligned via tblastn against a protein sequence database formed by translating these viral genomes in all 6 reading frames 14 . The relationship of all VirScan peptides to all human viruses can thus be represented as a matrix of alignment bit scores. Fig 2A contrasts the design of Pt1's non-overlapping enriched peptides, versus their alignment in this matrix. The numbers of these peptides which aligned to only one single virus are also reported. Note that consideration of peptide-virus alignments enables the possibility to detect infections involving viruses not explicitly represented in the VirScan library design (e.g., Macacine alphaherpesvirus 1). As the reference database is updated, it is thus possible that new infections may be identified by re-analyzing existing data.The matrix of alignment bitscores associated with Pt1's enriched, non-overlapping peptides is provided as a clustered heatmap in Fig 2B. Fig 2B illustrates that most of Pt1's enriched, non-overlapping peptides align with multiple viruses. Also apparent is that most of these alignments are shared among the human alphaherpesviruses. As expected, given the diagnosed HSV1 infection, however, almost every single peptide that aligns with an alphaherpesvirus, aligns with HSV1. Using a binomial test, we then calculated the probability that the fraction of HSV1-aligning selected peptides among all selected peptides would occur under a null model defined by the fractional representation of HSV1-aligning peptides in the entire VirScan library (Fig 2C) . In this way, Module 2 is used to rank order all potential infections by significance in preparation for the next stage of analysis.",

In this case, peptides aligning to both viruses are no longer associated with virusj. (ii) The number of non-shared peptides are significant for both viruses, suggesting that the uniquely aligning and the shared enrichments can be attributed to infections by both virusi and virusj. In this case, the shared peptides remain associated with both viruses. (iii) The number of shared peptides is significant, but the number of non-shared peptides associated with either virus alone is not significant. In this scenario we assume the enrichments are most likely due to a true infection, but that there is insufficient evidence to distinguish whether an infection originated from either or both viruses. In this case the shared peptide alignments remain shared, but both viruses are assigned a tag to indicate that their infections could not be distinguished. After each iteration of this probabilistic assessment of shared peptide-virus associations, enriched peptides associated exclusively with virusi are removed from consideration. An updated p-value is then calculated for each remaining virus, and the process is iterated until all virus pairs with shared peptide alignments have been analyzed.

Four of the nine cases with diagnoses confirmed by nucleic acid testing (Pt1, Pt2, Pt3, and Pt4) corresponded precisely with the infections indicated by AVARDA.

Closer investigation of Pt8's clinical history revealed previous Ganciclovir treatment for CMV infection, suggesting a long term prior infection. Consistent with this, AVARDA detected significant CMV antibodies at both day 1 and 14, but their reactivity was differentially unchanged over time. Clinical antibody testing agreed with the results of AVARDA, measuring increased HHV6-specific IgG in the convalescent serum. The remaining four patients were diagnosed with HSV (Pt5), enterovirus (Pt7), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV, Pt6 and Pt9, Fig 4E and Fig S1, respectively) , but none had significant pairwise changes detected by AVARDA over the two week period (Fig 4) .",

First, peptides enriched above a threshold are considered binary hits after Module 1, since their degrees of enrichment are not considered beyond the network graph filtering stage. If the contribution of each peptide to the final results were to be somehow weighted according to the magnitude of its enrichment, the confidence of the associated infection(s) could potentially be calculated more accurately. Second, the strengths of peptide-virus alignments, quantified as bit-scores, are similarly not considered by AVARDA. Incorporating these quantitative measures might also improve the final results. Third, enriched sets of peptides sharing a sevenamino acid sequence are currently treated as a single antibody specificity. However, the confidence associated with the enrichment of overlapping peptides is in general higher than for peptides enriched in isolation. If Module 1 attributed greater confidence to these peptide clusters, the sensitivity of AVARDA may be increased, particularly for infections eliciting more restricted responses.

Fourth, it may be possible to develop a statistical test that can distinguish among infections which are currently found to be indistinguishable by AVARDA. One can envision pairwise comparisons of homologous peptides that might discern the more likely of two highly related species (or even strains), when there is a consistent preference for antibody recognition of one organism's peptides over those of another. If such an approach were successful, it would enable expanding the taxonomic reference database beyond the virus species level, potentially enhancing the specificity of AVARDA. Even at the species level, AVARDA frequently cannot distinguish highly interrelated viruses, particularly enteroviruses and adenoviruses in our experience.

As described in Modules 2 and 3, when comparing sets of enriched peptides associated with each virus, we use binomial testing to determine the significance of the associations. The null model assumes the peptides aligning to each virus were randomly drawn from the VirScan library. For each virus with at least one enriched peptide alignment, we perform a binomial test using N = total number of enriched hits, k = hits aligning to virusi, and the null probability 'f', which is the total number of peptide alignments to virusi, divided by the total number of peptides in the VirScan library. All pairs of viruses that share enriched peptide alignments are evaluated as follows. First, a binomial test is performed on the non-shared ('unique') peptides, in order to weigh the evidence for each distinguishable infection on its own. For this test, f = (number of peptides aligning to virusi but not virusj) / (length of libraryshared alignments between virusi and virusj). Similarly, N = number of enriched hitsshared virusi,j hits. A second binomial test is performed on the shared (indistinguishable) peptide alignments. Here, f = shared virusi,j alignments/(length of libraryunique alignments to virusiunique alignments to virusj). To determine significance, we set a p-value threshold of p < 0.01, and require that the total number of peptide alignments, k > 2. These parameters can be adjusted depending on the desired stringency of the analysis.",

All viruses are then ranked in order of significance based on binomial testing of each virus's enriched peptide alignments. Next, the most significant virus is compared to every other virus which shares peptide alignments. In these comparisons, if either virus is found to have a statistically significant number of non-shared peptides while the other does not, the shared alignments are removed from the latter virus (case i in Fig 3A) . If both viruses are found to have statistically significant numbers of non-shared peptides, the shared alignments remain associated with both viruses, thus contributing to the significance of both infections (case ii in Fig 3A) . If neither virus is found to have a statistically significant number of non-shared peptides, binomial testing is performed on shared peptides to determine whether there is sufficient evidence for infection by at least one of the two viruses. If the viruses have a significant number of shared alignments, a numerical \"indistinguishability tag\" is annotated to the results to indicate that the algorithm was unable to accurately distinguish between infection by one or both of the viruses (case iii in Fig 3A) . Once the pairwise comparisons with the most significant virus have been completed, this virus is then removed from consideration and N is decreased by the number of peptides that were uniquely assigned to that virus. This procedure of updating N thus removes peptides associated with significant infections from consideration in subsequent tests of peptides using the null model. The p-values for each remaining virus are recalculated, and the new top ranking virusi is selected for the next round of comparisons until all virusij pairs have been evaluated. Finally, all p-values of infection are adjusted for multiple hypothesis correction in order to consider multiple hypothesis testing for all infections. Ancillary relevant data are also printed to file.",
