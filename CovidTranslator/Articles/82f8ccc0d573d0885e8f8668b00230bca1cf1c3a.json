HBsAg+ donor organs are generally reserved for life-threatening cases. HBsAg+ organs may be considered for use in recipients who are HBsAg+, have protective immunity to hepatitis as a result of immunization (HBsAb titer \u226510 mIU/ml) or natural infection, or who are from geographic locations with HBV hyperendemicity. Post-transplantation, hepatitis B immune globulin and an antiviral agent are administered to recipients of HBsAg+ organs, regardless of immune status, although prophylaxis does not prevent transmission of infection in all cases. All recipients require laboratory monitoring for acquired HBV. 15, 16 A common scenario is for the potential donor to be HBcAb+. The HBV serologic profiles, HbsAg-, HBcAb+ and HbsAb-, may appear with early HBV infection or later (resolved) infection. Alternatively, these profiles can sometimes represent a false positive result, especially if risk factors for HBV are absent. Results demonstrating HBcAb+ or HBsAb+ are consistent with resolved infection, although HBV may persist in the liver. The risk of transmission of infection from a HbsAg-, HBcAb+ or HBsAb+/-donor to a susceptible nonhepatic organ recipient is low. 16, 17 Recipients with protective immunity require no post-transplantation therapy. HBV non-immune recipients, however, should undergo serial laboratory testing for HBV infection or receive antiviral prophylaxis with an agent such as lamivudine or hepatitis B immune globulin. 15, 16 Donor NAT for HBV may be useful in assessing the risk of transmission and for the management of recipients. 16 For hepatitis C virus (HCV), the risk of viral transmission from an infected donor to a seronegative recipient is substantial, ranging from 25%-100%, [18] [19] [20] and recipients with acquired HCV are at risk for chronic infection and progressive liver disease, the course of which may be accelerated by immunosuppressive therapy, especially mycophenolate mofetil. 19 To prevent inadvertent transmission of HCV, donors are screened with an EIA for HCV, and HCV+ organs are generally excluded from transplantation with the exception of emergency situations, often with preferential allocation to HCVinfected recipients. 21 False negative test results can occur with HCV antibody testing, and the mean window period from infection to seroconversion is 66 days. As a consequence, transmission events involving HCV seronegative donors have occurred. 22, 23 HCV NAT testing of donors may detect infection in cases of negative antibody testing, but is not routinely performed at the present time.

The greatest risk factor for PTLD is D+/R-serostatus. Thus, donors are serologically screened so that risk can be assessed and the EBV D+/R-recipient can be appropriately monitored post-transplant. Donor screening is most important in the setting of pediatric transplantation, as younger recipients may not have naturally acquired the infection yet. The seroprevalence of EBV exceeds 90% in the adult population, and so the donor is presumed positive if serology is not performed. 2, 4 Other than that based on past medical history and physical examination, donors are not routinely screened for other herpesvirus infections, such as herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus and human herpesviruses 6, 7 and 8.

Donor bacteremia is common, with reported rates of up to 16%. 29, 30 These infections can be transmitted to the recipient and result in potentially fatal early post-transplant complications, such as bacteremia, myocarditis and mycotic aneurysms. 31, 32 Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida spp., in particular, have a propensity to cause these serious complications. Sepsis and infections are not absolute contraindications to organ donation; rather, antimicrobial therapy is administered to the donor (if the infection is identified pre-mortem) and the recipient to reduce the risk of transmission. 4, 30 Similarly, organs from donors with bacterial meningitis have been used successfully as long as the donor received appropriate antibiotic therapy pre-mortem. 30 To identify subclinical infections, blood and urine are often collected at the time of organ donation, especially if the donor has been hospitalized for more than 48 hours. Generally, recipients who receive organs from bacteremic or fungemic donors receive directed anti-infective therapy for a period of 7-14 days. 29, 30, 33 The lung is the most common site of infection in donors. 30 When lung transplantation is under consideration, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and gram stain and culture of respiratory secretions is performed. 34 Donors with evidence of gram-positive bacterial infections (bloodstream or pneumonia) are often used. Use of lungs with gram-negative infections is more controversial; some experts favor discarding these organs, while others advocate their use with aggressive antibiotic therapy. 34, 35 Supporting the latter argument, a recent retrospective study demonstrated a high rate of transmission of respiratory tract pathogens to lung recipients (>40%), but overall patient survival was no different from that of recipients of uninfected lungs. 35 ",

Organ donors who meet any of these criteria are generally considered only for recipients in life-threatening situations, and additional consent must be obtained from the recipient. Some experts advocate the use of viral NAT to supplement serologic testing of high-risk donors. 41, 42 With NAT, the window period from infection to viral detection can be reduced to 5-10 days for HIV, 3-5 days for HCV, and to a lesser extent, 20-22 days (from 44 days) for HBV. 14, 43 Negative NAT results may provide further information about the risk of donor viral infections and maximize organ utilization.
