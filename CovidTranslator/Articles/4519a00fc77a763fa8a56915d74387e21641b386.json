            "text": "The availability of safe water has been an ongoing problem and is becoming worse with increasing urbanization and population density. Only about 30% of the fresh water total is available on earth, in groundwater and surface water, for drinking and other daily human activities as well as industrial and agricultural activities. However, only 2% of fresh water is available for usage due to its nonavailability (comes at inconvenient times and places) and contamination by human activities (Fig. 3.1 ). Developed countries have advanced technology for water treatment and are thus able to manage the problem of water scarcity to a large extent, but advanced technology is largely unprocurable in developing and undeveloped countries due to cost. Based on the current population growth rate, it has been estimated that over 3.5 billion people will be in a water scarcity condition by 2025. The problem has become exacerbated due to the introduction of various recalcitrant, nondegradable compounds by agricultural and industrial activities. These compounds cannot be removed completely by any current available technologies.",

            "text": "Contaminated water has a high concentration of heavy metals, phenolic compounds, pesticides, etc., in addition to a high microbial load. Children (0-8 years) are at major risk from consumption of contaminated water leading to various neurological diseases, weakening of the immune system, and arrested growth [1] (Table 3 .1). Over 1.8 million (4.1% of total global deaths due to diseases) human deaths have been reported by WHO (World Health Organization) annually due to consumption of contaminated water. The number of deaths due to waterborne diseases is directly correlated with socioeconomic condition: the lower the socioeconomic condition, the higher the number of deaths due to waterborne diseases [2] . The available conventional water treatment technologies, like solvent extraction, activated carbon adsorption, chemical oxidation, or biological methods, are inadequate to effectively remove recalcitrant pollutants from water. Nanotechnology can provide a solution to these water treatment issues by removal of many types of recalcitrant compounds in addition to microbial load, including viruses. Besides water treatments using nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), nanosorbents, dendrimers, etc., nanotechnology can also be used in water desalination, disinfection, and sensors (contaminants can be sensed even at sub-ppm concentrations). Four classes of nanomaterials are now being used for water treatment: metal-containing nanoparticles, carbonaceous nanomaterials, zeolites, and dendrimers. They can remove even toxic heavy metals like arsenic, organic material, salinity, nitrates, pesticides, etc. from surface water, groundwater, and wastewater. This is true because of their large specific surface area, high reactivity, high degree of functionalization, size-dependent properties, and high affinity for specific target contaminants. Most importantly, nanomaterials can be used to treat water without addition of chlorine (known to be controversial due to generation of carcinogenic compounds). The technology of water desalination, softening, and salt recovery as well as treatment of industrial and brackish water using nanostructured filters and nanoreactive membranes have made nanotechnology more in demand [3] . Electrospun nanofibers have gained much attention in water treatment, as they also can inhibit the bacterial growth responsible for membrane biofouling. Nanomaterials used for water treatment can easily be merged into distributed optimal technology networks (DOT-NETs) being used in water treatment for small-scale housing subdivisions, apartment complexes, and commercial districts. Further, they can also be used in treatment plants like factory assembled, compact ready-to-use water treatment systems, point of entry (POE), and point of use (POU) treatment units.",

However, this technology has not yet reached the commercial market. The foremost reason for this is the potential toxicological risks for humans and the environment, which cannot be ignored for the sake of the many technological advantages. Genotoxicity and cytotoxicity studies have revealed that nanomaterials are effective agents in interacting with biological macromolecules present in living systems and thus are responsible for a number of diseases and clinical disorders [4] . Therefore a need exists for additional technology that can lower the toxicological impact of nanomaterials while retaining their abilities for water purification, disinfection, sensing, and monitoring.",

There are various types of wastewater based on water uses: urban wastewater (blackwater coming from toilets and greywater coming from kitchens and bathing), industrial wastewater, commercial establishment wastewater (including hospitals), agricultural wastewater, etc. Further, collected wastewater in a municipal piped system (sewerage) is called sewage. Wastewater treatment usually follows three steps: primary treatment, secondary treatment, and tertiary treatment. Before proceeding through the various steps, wastewater is pretreated to remove grit, grease, and gross solids that could hinder the subsequent treatment stages. Primary treatment aims to settle down suspended solids (both organic and inorganic), followed by removing them. Primary settlers, septic tanks, and imhoff tanks are most commonly used for primary water treatment. Secondary treatment involves removal of soluble biodegradable organics through degradation by bacteria and protozoa, through aerobic or anaerobic biological processes. Aerated lagoons, activated sludge, trickling filters, oxidation ditches, etc. are used for secondary water treatment. Tertiary treatment polishes the effluent before it is discharged or reused, by removal of nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorous), toxic compounds, residual suspended matter, or microorganisms, through disinfection with chlorine, ozone, ultraviolet radiation, or membrane filtration (micro-, nano-, ultra-, and reverse osmosis), etc. Tertiary treatment is the most costly of the three treatments, and is often not done in low-income countries. Finally, the treated water is released for various applications.",

            "text": "The need to provide accurate data on levels of wastewater generated annually has been emphasized by national policymakers, researchers, practitioners, and public institutions, as this data is necessary for developing national policy and action plans based on type of wastewater and contaminant levels. However, accurate information related to wastewater is not systemically monitored in most of the countries of the world, with significant data paucity in rural areas. In 2010, global annual domestic water withdrawals modeled by WaterGAP3 (global freshwater model that calculates flows and storages of water across the world) have found that there was approximately 450 km 3 of global production of wastewater coming from the domestic and manufacturing sectors, with 70% of wastewater (315 km 3 ) coming from the domestic sector. AQUASTAT (database that provides information on global water systems) has reported that globally more than 330 km 3 year \u22121 of (mostly) municipal wastewater are produced [6] . Countries like the United States, China, Brazil, Japan, Russia, India, and Indonesia collectively produce over 167 km 3 of wastewater per year (half of global municipal wastewater production). It has also been reported by AQUASTAT that, on average, 60% of produced municipal wastewater is treated globally. These figures on wastewater treatment are much lower due to the poor treatment capacities of wastewater treatment plants, particularly in middle-and low-income countries. Further, data is generally not reported by some low-income countries with large urban populations (such as Nigeria). It has been found that most of the countries report only secondary and tertiary treated wastewater as \"treated wastewater,\" while some countries report only primary treated wastewater, which makes data aggregation and comparisons by country rather more difficult. In 2014, GWS (global water store) 2009 reported that globally 24 km 3 year \u22121 of wastewater generally passes all three phases of water treatment [7] . It has been found from wastewater treatment data that there is a strong correlation between treatments of wastewater and a country's income [8] . High-income, middle-income, and low-income countries have reported an average of wastewater treatment as 70%, 28%, and 8%, respectively. More importantly, in the case of developing countries, most untreated wastewater is directly discharged into natural water bodies due to either dysfunctionality or limited capacity of water treatment plants.",

Lack of water sources, groundwater salinity, and unaffordability of fresh water are the major reasons behind usage of untreated wastewater. Most commonly, untreated wastewater is used for agriculture [9] . \u2022 Indirect use of untreated wastewater: This is being practiced in low-and middle-income countries having drier and wetter climates. Here, untreated wastewater is directly discharged into freshwater streams for dilution and is subsequently used by farmers, in households, or by industries. Several examples of indirect use of untreated wastewater are found in sub-Saharan Africa, Nepal, India, and many cities in Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia that have inadequate sanitation facilities. It has been reported that in West Africa, farmers use highly polluted water in the vicinity of cities for irrigating their vegetables. It has been found that up to 90% of vegetables being consumed in the cities are grown through irrigation using polluted water [11] . \u2022 Planned use of reclaimed water: This occurs more frequently in higher income countries having well-established water treatment plants. They are much more environmentally aware of their wastewater, which is reclaimed and used to preserve freshwater ecosystems. Reclaimed water is directly used for agricultural irrigation, city landscaping, golf courses, toilet flushing, washing of vehicles, and groundwater recharge, as well as being a source of potable water supply. Windhoek in Namibia is one of the examples of this type of water reclamation and usage. Even industrial wastewater is purified to industrial standards and recycled within the system. In countries of the Middle East and North Africa, Australia, the Mediterranean, and the United States of America (AQUASTAT 2014; Global Water Intelligence 2010), planned use of reclaimed water is seen. In all of these cases, an effective sanitation and treatment technology supports water reclamation; however, the main challenge for water reuse is public acceptance [12] .",

Even excreta collected from toilets either on-site (e.g., in a pit latrine or septic tank) or transported off-site in sewer systems are also termed sludge. Fresh and untreated sludge contains many pathogens, has a high proportion of water, has higher BOD (biochemical, or biological, oxygen demand), and is generally putrid and odorous. Additionally, it also contains essential nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous, so it is a very beneficial fertilizer for plants. The organic carbon present in sludge is used as a soil conditioner, as it improves soil structure that helps in proper growth of plant roots. Further, the organic carbon can also be converted into energy through biodigestion or incineration. The composition of sludge depends on the source types; sometimes it is highly contaminated with harmful pollutants like heavy metals (in the case of sewage coming from industries). Sludge treatment is a must before using the sludge in various applications. The treatment involves reducing water content, BOD, pathogens, and obnoxious odor, followed by thickening, drying, and stabilization. Dewatering is an energy consumptive process, sometimes taking even weeks for complete sludge drying through incineration, pyrolysis, or gasification [13] . The most important step, responsible for making sludge fit for various applications, is stabilization, accomplished by aerobic and anaerobic processes. Aerobic stabilization uses composting at higher temperatures (55\u00b0C), similar to the natural process that takes place in the forest leading to breakdown of organic material containing leaf litter, animal wastes, etc. and reducing volume by severalfold. In the case of anaerobic stabilization (cannot be used when contaminated with heavy metals), reduction of organic wastes takes place through bacterial decomposition under anaerobic conditions and produces a mixture of gases containing methane, carbon dioxide gas, and syngas. Properly treated sludge is called biosolids. These solids have a variety of beneficial uses like landscaping, energy recovery, generation of new soil, increasing soil fertility, etc. Sludge treatment is also dependent on the economic status of the country [14] .",

In other cases, sludge is discharged directly into water bodies, where it is diluted and finds its way back into the food chain when that water is used for farming. \u2022 Formal use of biosolids: This occurs in developed countries with regulated and well-designed biosolid and septage programs. Properly planned sludge treatment leads to the generation of biosolids, which is very useful in producing soil nutrients and thus maintains soil fertility while reducing the pressure on the final disposal sites.

They can remove recalcitrant organic and inorganic contaminants, degrade organic compounds (chlorinated alkanes and benzenes, pesticides, organic dyes, nitro aromatics, dioxins, furans, etc.) and reduce toxic metal ions [Cr (VI), Ag (I), Pt (II)] [17] . Nanoparticles can easily be functionalized with various chemical groups depending on the contaminant types (making them more efficient). Commonly used nanoparticles for adsorbents are: TiO 2 , Fe 0 , Fe 0 /Pd 0 , Fe 0 /Pt 0 , Fe 0 /Ag 0 , Fe 0 /Ni 0 , Fe 0 /Co 0 , or hybrids (viz. Pt/TiO 2 /Ru nanoparticles). Innovative nanosorbents prepared by hybridization of inorganic and organic nanosorbents (viz. sodium [18] . CNTs are used for sorption of metal ions like Pb (II), Cu (II), and Cd (II) with several thousand higher sorption capacities than the powdered or granular activated carbon. Further, they can adsorb volatile organic compounds and water-soluble dyes (acridine orange, ethidium bromide, eosin bluish, and orange G). Chitosan nanoparticles (40-100 nm) can easily be functionalized based on the application type, viz. phosphate functionalization used to adsorb Pb (II) [19] . Nanozeolites (viz. NaP1 zeolites: Na 6 Al 6 Si 10 O 32 , 12H 2 O) are used for removal of heavy metal ions (Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu, Cd), even from acidic wastewater, due to their excellent metal ion exchanging capacities. Nanosorbents are available in various forms (pellets, beads, or porous granules), making them more easily incorporated into existing treatment processes. Further, there are well-established protocols for their regeneration, which makes them more desirable due to the increased reusability and cost reduction by severalfold. Arsen X np (hybrid nanoparticles of FeO and polymers) and ADSORBSIA (beaded TiO 2 nanoparticles with diameter from 0.25 to 1.2 mm) for arsenic removal have been commercialized on a pilot scale [20] .

            "text": "\u2022 Carbon-based nanosorbents: The most commonly used carbon-based nanosorbent is the CNT. It is very effective in removal of bulky organic compounds, including antibiotics and various pharmaceutical compounds and heavy metal (Cu 2+ , Pb 2+ , Cd 2+ , and Zn 2+ ) contaminants, more so than conventionally used activated carbon. This is attributed to the very large surface area and the number of interactions, including hydrophobic effect, \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, hydrogen bonding, covalent bonding, and electrostatic interactions [21] . It has fast adsorption kinetics due to the large number of accessible adsorption sites containing functional groups like carboxyl, hydroxyl, and phenol, as well as the small distance of intraparticle diffusion [22] . However, the frequent problem of CNT aggregation in aqueous media decreases its effective surface area. In terms of adsorption, there is little difference with CNT aggregation due to the presence of many interstitial spaces and grooves helping in adsorption [23] . For many specific applications, CNTs are coated with specific agents like sand granules, which helps in removal of toxic metal ions (Hg 2+ ) and even removal of bulky dyes like rhodamine B [24] . Generally, carbon-based nanosorbents are used during the polishing step of water treatment due to their high cost and sensitivity. \u2022 Metal-based nanosorbents: These are generally used for heavy metals (arsenic, lead, mercury, copper, cadmium, chromium, and nickel) and radionuclide removal from wastewater. Metal oxides (FeO, TiO 2 , and Al 2 O 3 ) are commonly used as adsorbents having excellent kinetics of metal adsorption due to the large surface area, short intraparticle distance of diffusion, and large number of reaction sites [25] . Metal oxide nanosorbents have the additional property of magnetism, giving them more efficiency in removal of heavy metals. It has been found that the smaller the size of nanosorbents, the greater is the magnetism and thus the higher the adsorption capacity. Lab experimentation has found that a decrease in particle size increases the volume of many atomic magnetic dipoles. However, if the size is less than 11 nm, the particle loses its own magnetism but responds to externally applied magnetism [26, 27] . Metal oxide nanosorbents can be easily compressed into porous pellets and fine powders using moderate pressure, based on the type of application. These nanosorbents are recommended for removal of arsenic and organic contaminants for POU applications. Further, their low cost and low toxicity have made them very popular. \u2022 Polymeric nanosorbents: The most commonly used polymeric nanosorbents are dendrimeric nanosorbents for treatment of water containing organic compounds and heavy metals. Their inner shell is hydrophobic, which adsorbs organic compounds, while the hydrophilic exterior shell adsorbs heavy metals through its tailored branches. The phenomenon of adsorption is caused by complexation, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic effect, and hydrogen bonding. Some dendrimer nanosorbents have been prepared for removal of specific contaminants; for example, polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer-NH 2 is used for removal of copper ions from wastewater. The main advantage of regeneration is desirable due to the significant cost reduction. Lab testing on dendrimer-based water treatment is in process; hopefully dendrimers will soon make it into the commercial market [28] . (b) Membranes and membrane processes: Membranes and their related processes make use of nanomaterials like nano-Ag, CNTs, and polyvinyl-N-carbazole-SWNT (single walled nanotubes) nanocomposites. They carry out water treatment by providing a physical barrier using selectivity and permeability. They can remove organic and inorganic pollutants and heavy metals as well as biological contaminants (bacteria, virus) from groundwater and surface water. Membranes have wide credence due to their nontoxicity, reusability, minimal labor requirements for operation and maintenance, small space requirements, and ability to fit easily in any set-up. Further, they are mechanically and thermally stable, resistant to biofouling, and have excellent shelf-life [29] . Water purification and desalination are carried out by these membranes using ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), forward osmosis (FO), and reverse osmosis (RO). Only RO and FO are energy-driven processes, while the others work on the differences in the osmolalities. They have made it possible to even treat sea water and brackish water and make it fit for drinking [30] . Sometimes doping with suitable materials is required to prevent any nanomaterials leaching into the treated water; this also can 3.3 Nanotechnology and water remediation inactivate microbial pathogens [31] . The following paragraphs discuss different types of membranes and their applications.",

They are highly porous and have very large surface area. Their physical properties, like diameter, composition, morphology, secondary structure, and spatial alignment, can easily be modulated, due to which they have wide applications. They work by UF, FO, and RO processes to purify water containing heavy metals, organic and inorganic pollutants, microbial pathogens, etc. They are also found to be useful in air filtration by removing all harmful gases. They are sometimes doped with materials like ceramics, TiO 2 , to protect themselves from biofouling. They are in great demand due to their adaptability and ease of fabrication [32] . \u2022 Nanocomposite membranes: These are known for their increased efficacies with respect to various parameters such as membrane permeability, surface hydrophilicity, mechanical and thermal stability, and reduced fouling. A broad range of nanomaterials is used: hydrophilic metal oxide nanoparticles (Al 2 O 3 , TiO 2 , and zeolite), antimicrobial nanoparticles (nano-Ag and CNTs), and (photo) catalytic nanomaterials (bimetallic nanoparticles, TiO 2 ). Thin film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes have been developed with enhanced membrane permeability and larger surface charge density (mostly negative) based on nanozeolites, nano-Ag, nano-TiO 2 , CNTs, etc. Further, they have antifouling properties and increased membrane hydrophilicity, which helps in salt exclusion. Sometimes they are doped to gain additional properties like photocatalysis, higher versatility, etc. based on application type. Quantum Flux (the commercial name of a nanozeolite-based nanocomposite membrane) is used for desalination of sea water and makes it fit for use. It has been doped with nano-TiO 2 (\u22645 wt%), which prevents membrane fouling [33, 34] . TFN membranes are mostly desirous for their enhanced water permeability and reduced cost. However, they have not been very successful in water desalination due to various limitations [35] . , 50% for KCl at 0.3 mM, and negligible when KCl is at 10 mM. There are various technical challenges that have impeded large production of aquaporins with aligned CNTs [36] . \u2022 Nanostructured and reactive membranes: These membranes are existing filtration membranes fabricated with various nanomaterials to enhance efficiency. For example, depositing nano-TiO 2 improves contaminant degradation in the presence of sunlight; metal retention capacity can be enhanced by depositing poly (l-glutamic acid) and poly (l-lysine); and fabrication with CNTs helps in removal of pathogenic microorganisms like E. coli, Staphylococus aureus, and Poliovirus sabin 1 from contaminated water. These membranes are very useful in water treatment for removal of those recalcitrant contaminants that cannot be removed by any other known methods. Alumina membranes fabricated with several layers of poly(styrene sulfonate)/poly(allylamine hydrochloride) have high retention for divalent cations (Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ ) and anions like Cl \u2212 and SO 4 2\u2212 while fabrication with A-alumoxanes nanoparticles (7-25 nm) leads to increased selectivity for synthetic dyes like Direct Red 81, Direct Yellow 71, and Direct Blue 71. Incorporation of bimetallic Fe 0 /Pt 0 nanoparticles or zero-valent iron (nZVI) into a cellulose acetate membrane helps in reduction of chlorinated organic compounds like TCE (trichloroethylene), PCE (tetrachloroethylene), etc. More innovations are yet to come, with the additional advantage of wide acceptance due to the presence of the basic membranes, which are commonly used [37] .",

Nanomaterials like TiO 2 , CeO 2 and CNTs have excellent photocatalytic properties due to their large surface area, which can be used for water treatment by completely degrading organic pollutants through fast catalysis. TiO 2 is an excellent photocatalyst nanomaterial, as it rapidly generates an ionic pair upon UV irradiation, which forms reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for contaminant degradation and pathogenic killing. It is very cost effective, not very toxic, and widely available. The smaller the size of the nano-TiO 2 , the higher is the rate of photocatalysis due to the increased number of reactive facets. However, a size smaller than 11 nm does not further increase photocatalysis, as there is an increase in interfacial charge carrier transfer. Further, TiO 2 nanotubes are more efficient than TiO 2 -nanoparticles due to the increased photocatalysis and higher degradation rate of organic compounds as provided by shorter diffusion paths inside the tubular wall. It has been found that additional doping with various novel metals, dye sensitizers, semiconductors, and anions can further increase the rate of photocatalysis by narrowing the bandgap, which allows excitation even by visible light. Crystallographic studies on TiO 2 nanomaterials have revealed that {001} facets have the highest photocatalytic activity due to the small spatial separation between electron and holes as well as the strong adsorption [38] .

In the case of UV irradiation, DNA synthesis is additionally blocked, leading to disruption of all cellular activities and subsequently the death of the waterborne pathogens. These oxidants are cheap, efficacious, and easily accessible. However, they are also responsible for generation of toxic by-products (trihalomethanes, haloacetic acid, aldehydes), with some of them being carcinogenic in nature, including nitrosamines, bromates, etc. [40] .

Different nanoparticles have varied modes of pathogen killing, with a commonality of a broad antimicrobial spectrum. Nano-Ag works by releasing Ag + which binds to thiol groups of cellular proteins and inactivates them, leading to death of the pathogens. Additionally, they prevent DNA replication, which inhibits synthesis of important cellular proteins. It has also been found that they can cause structural damage in the pathogenic cell envelope. Nano-Ag has been commercialized under the trade name MARATHON and Aquapure systems, used in POU treatment, microfilters, etc. Despite the low human toxicity, it is crucial to check the level of Ag + in the released water. Factors like size, shape, coating, and crystallographic facets are significantly important in the release kinetics of Ag + . CNTs carry out pathogenic killing through their conductivity leading to cell membrane perturbation, oxidative stress, and disruption of cellular structures [41] . Further, they remove pathogens by size exclusion activity provided by their layered structure. Generally, multiwalled nanotubes (MWNTs) are the most effective due to their fibrous shape and layered structure, which helps in providing excellent conductivity. Mostly small-sized CNTs are preferred for POU devices, due to their higher toxicity than the larger-sized CNTs. Metallic nanoparticles (MgO) can kill Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as their spores (e.g., Bacillus subtillus) by disrupting their membrane integrity. Nanoparticles like dendrons, dendrimers, hyperbranched polymers, and dendrigraft polymers obstruct pathogens by inhibiting their entry due to their small size (0.1-1.0 nm) provided by their architecture, containing core, interior branch cells, and terminal branch cell. They usually require pressure between 200 and 700 kPa, which makes the process highly energy consumptive. This can be circumvented by a tangential or cross-flow of water movement during purification.",

Nanomaterials are important components in the last three units due to their electrochemical, optical, and magnetic properties, while recognition is generally handled using antibodies, aptamers, carbohydrates, antimicrobial peptides, etc. Nanomaterials can be used in the first unit of the sensor due to having a very large specific surface area, which can easily be functionalized by various chemical groups for modulating their affinity towards a variety of water contaminants. For example, 3.3 Nanotechnology and water remediation quantum dots (QDs) modified with TiO 2 are used to detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at pM, while QDs modified with CoTe are used for bisphenol A at 10 nM, etc. Commonly used nanomaterials for sensors are magnetic nanoparticles, noble metals, silica nanoparticles, dye-doped nanoparticles, CNTs, and QDs. Metal nanoparticle detection is based on changes in absorption at specific wavelengths, while novel metal nanomaterials detect change in Rayleigh scattering due to their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). In the case of silica nanoparticles, surface modification with organic or inorganic luminescent dyes is used to enhance their sensitivity and protect from photobleaching [42] . CNTs are used in the electrode of the sensor, as they have high conductance, which facilitates faster electron transfer in addition to the amplifier unit of the sensor. However, the preparation of homogenous CNTs is the most challenging aspect. They are used for detecting trace metals and organic pollutants in the water. Dynabead is a commercially used nanosensor to detect pathogens. It is based on a magnetic nanocomposite made of CdSe, which is a semiconductor, having excellent electronic characteristics, that detects based on changes in fluorescent spectra. Nanomaterials as sensors can easily enter the market as they are not placed in direct contact with users. However, aspects such as cost effectiveness, regulatory and public acceptance, water solubility, long-term performance and stability, and testing in real natural and wastewater must be researched thoroughly, to bring about their ultimate success in the commercial market. The previously mentioned annoying aspect of aggregation has impeded the use of nanomaterials in nanosensors, as it impairs sensitivity and reproducibility. Work is in progress to obstruct aggregation by surface functionalization, but currently there is no hard-core protocol claiming to resist aggregation completely.",

Further, their significance in water quality checks makes them desirable for use in various types of water purifiers. The Freedonia group has released a forecast of nanomaterials demand by 2020 by classifying nanomaterials into metal oxides, clays, metals, polymers and chemicals, nanotubes, and dendrimers in various applications besides water treatment. It has been anticipated that nanomaterials like silica, TiO 2 , clays, metal powders, and polymers will be in great demand in the coming years. The role of CNTs, fullerenes, dendrimers, and membrane-derived nanomaterials for processes like RO, NF, and UF in wastewater treatment is formidable, with their advantages of flexibility, easier operation and maintenance, and scalability [43] . However, besides the many expectations, various challenges remain to be met, to bring them into the commercial market. The crucial aspects that must be thoroughly taken care of are: commercial availability of nanomaterials, extent of compatibility with the existing infrastructure, and associated health risks (such as leaching of nanomaterials into treated water). It has been found that the water generated directly from various sources (household and industrial) is rich in suspended particles that impede the treatment, particularly removal of soluble recalcitrant contaminants. It has been suggested to use nanotechnology-based water treatment methods followed by conventional treatment methods, which will lower the loads of suspended particles and help in efficient water treatment in a cost-effective way. Further, using nanotechnology either in the primary or secondary stages rather than in the final stages of water treatment would lower the risk of any nanomaterials leaching into the treated water and coming in direct contact with humans and the environment. Various other measures have been under consideration to make nanotechnology-based water treatment a complete success.",

They can degrade recalcitrant water pollutants in an ecofriendly manner, requiring no toxic chemicals for their action. They work under mild physical conditions, which makes the process energy saving. Some enzymes require additional factors for their action, particularly metal ions like Cu, Ni, Mg, Mn, Zn, etc. Enzymes can work in the presence of foams, sprays, lotions, and even detergents, which has made them even more in demand for water treatment. Generally, enzymes are extracted from microbial or plant sources. However, recombinant enzymes are also prepared when the source has insufficient enzyme concentrations. Most importantly, enzymes have been proven to degrade those recalcitrant water contaminants that cannot be degraded by oxidation (chemical, photochemical, electrochemical), ozonation, photolysis using H 2 O 2 and O 3 , corona process, TiO 2 photolysis, radiolysis, and or even adsorbed or filtered by known nanoparticles in some cases (Tables 3.4 and 3.5). There are various reasons for contaminant recalcitrance, the foremost being the presence of unusual substitutions with halides (Cl \u2212 or Br \u2212 ), azo (\ue05dN\ue035N) linkage, very large molecular size, and the presence of unusual bonds or highly condensed aromatic rings or presence of tertiary and quaternary carbon atoms. Enzymes can act specifically on the unusual bonds or substitutions and produce degradation.

Their usage has been strictly regulated in most developed countries. Various classes of enzymes being used in their degradation are: (a) Peroxidases: They are used for hydrolyzing aromatic contaminants with their action dependent on the presence of peroxides (H 2 O 2 ). They can be obtained from a number of microorganisms as well as plants. Different peroxidases 3.4 Enzyme technology and water remediation (based on substrate or sources) that have been used for treatment of water pollutant treatment are listed here: 1. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP): It can hydrolyze toxic aromatic compounds like phenols, biphenols, anilines, hydroxyquinoline, arylamine, carcinogens (benzidines and naphthylamines), and related heteroaromatic compounds. Further, compounds that are not the substrates of HRP can also be treated, as the enzyme helps in forming insoluble precipitates while acting on its substrates followed by sedimentation and filtration of precipitates [45] . The enzyme has a broad range of physico-chemical parameters (pH, temperature, ionic strength, etc.), and thus it is one of the most effective enzymes in treatment of wastewater highly contaminated with pollutants. . It removes phenols by its hydroxylation followed by production of o-quinones, which are insoluble in water hence easily collected through filtration [52] . The enzyme usually works in the concentration range from 0.01 to 1.0 g dm \u22123 of phenol present in wastewater. Laccase: It is produced by many fungi, but Rhizoctonia praticola produces a larger amount of the enzyme than any other known sources. This enzyme is not very specific towards its substrate, but it can act on a number of similarly looking phenols. During its action, it generates anionic free radicals, which help in precipitation of many recalcitrant pollutants present in wastewater [53] . \u2022 Pulp and paper wastes (a) Peroxidases: During wood pulping, 5%-8% (w/w) of residual modified lignin is produced by the Kraft process, which imparts a brown color to the pulp. This brown color is removed by bleaching agents (chlorine and chlorine oxides) at commercial scale. These chlorinated compounds are highly toxic and mutagenic and are released into the effluents, creating a major environmental hazard. Horseradish peroxidase and lignin peroxidase (from P. chrysosporium) are helpful in treating Kraft mill effluents, particularly in color removal and degradation of lignin by oxidizing aromatic units to cation radicals, which can be easily decomposed [54, 55] . (b) Laccase: This enzyme is useful in treating effluent coming from bleaching industries and helps in removal of chlorophenols and chlorolignins [56] . It is an intracellular enzyme produced by the fungus Coriolus versicolor. (c) Cellulolytic enzymes: These include cellobiohydrolase, cellulase, and \u03b2-glucosidase, helpful in treatment of sludge generated from pulping and deinking operations. They are able to convert cellulosic sludge (60 kg ton \u22121 of pulp) generated from pulping into ethanol (higher commercial value). Further, they are not inhibited by high ink content (present in pulp) and their efficiency can be increased by adding surfactants [57] . \u2022 Pesticides: They are chemicals used against herbs, weeds, insects, and fungal pathogens for crop protection. The worst part is not their recalcitrance towards degradation but their usage in amounts several times higher than are actually required, due to ignorance. This leads to their enhanced concentration not only in the growing crop but also in the water table deep inside the soil. Further, pesticideproducing industries have other serious concerns due to their continuous disposal of chemical wastes into surface waters. Physical (such as incineration) and chemical treatment of pesticides are not effective and they produce hazardous byproducts and are expensive [58] . Enzyme-based treatment of pesticides has given some hope; presently only an enzyme has been identified to be useful in pesticide detoxification, which is parathion hydrolase [59] .",

Chitinase from Serratia marcescens QMB1466 is used for shrimp pretreatment, leading to its size reduction, deproteination and demineralization, followed by production of single cell protein (SCP). Further, it is used in treatment of shellfish waste rich in chitin content [71] . \u2022 Solid waste and sludge treatment: Solid waste and sludge are generally accompanied with lignocellulosic and cellulosic waste, which can be treated with an enzyme system containing endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolase, and cellobiase and turned into useful products like sugars, ethanol, biogas, and other energetic end products [72] . This enzyme system has been found to be useful in treating the organic fraction present in municipal solid wastes (MSW) into fermentable sugars like ethanol or butanol under anerobic conditions, which can then be collected for various other applications [73] . The enzyme system econase (endo-1, 4-\u03b2-d-glucanase, cellobiohydrolase and exo-1, 4-\u03b2-dglucosidase) is also helpful in treating MSW [74] . Sludge dewatering is done using carbohydrase, lipase, and proteinase to reduce the volume of sewage sludge [75] . Peroxidases are also helpful in dewatering MSW sludge as well as in sedimentation of slimy material (very difficult to settle) by removal of water molecules and enhancement of mechanical binding of slime particles. Further, they also promote growth of microbes like algae and molds, which helps in additional aggregation and increased viscosity, leading to effective sedimentation of slimy material [76] . \u2022 Removal of heavy metals: Various industrial processes like mixing, smelting, electroplating, synthesis of pigment, nuclear power, defense, and fuel reprocessing produce a number of heavy metals like arsenic, copper, cadmium, uranium, lead, chromium, strontium, etc. discharged into water. Phosphatase containing cells of Citrobacter sp. are found to be useful in remediation of wastewater containing heavy metals. The remediation of heavy metal-containing wastewater by the enzyme phosphatase involves production of insoluble phosphate, followed by precipitation of almost all types of heavy metals, and collection. This enzyme has optimal pH stability in the range from 5 to 9, with temperature stability from 10\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C. The enzyme can severely be affected by the presence of high concentrations (>5 mM) of ions like Cl \u2212 and CN \u2212 [77] [78] [79] .",

The two most common methods used for hard water treatment are lime soda and ion exchange softening. They are popular due to their cost effectiveness and faster action. Other methods include distillation, nanofiltration, electrodialysis, CNTs, capacitive deionization, and reverse osmosis. Lime soda and ion exchange softening methods also have drawbacks. In the case of lime soda, there is production of lots of sludge, which requires additional treatment by harsh chemicals followed by acidic treatment.

However, they have not yet landed in the commercial market, as large-scale testing in still in process. The laboratory set-up (diagrammatically shown in Fig. 3.3 ) contains an electrolytic cell containing an anode (immobilized glucose dehydrogenase) onto Nafion membrane and a cathode of Pt/C. A porous ion exchanger membrane is between the anodic and cathodic chambers. There is a central chamber with an inlet of hard water and an outlet for treated water without metallic ions. A solution of glucose prepared in phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) in addition to NAD + fills the anodic chamber while there is only a phosphate buffer with the same pH in the cathodic chamber. During hard water softening, the cathodic chamber exchanges cations (such as Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ ) while the anodic chamber exchanges anions (such as Cl \u2212 ). This is carried out by oxidation of glucose into gluconic acid with the reduction of NAD + to NADH + H + by the enzyme in the presence of oxygen being sparged along with the hard water. In the anodic chamber, production of H + ions leads to removal of Cl \u2212 from hard water as HCl, while gluconate in the cathodic chamber combines with divalent (Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ ), thus freeing the hard water from the ions responsible for its hardness. It has been found that Ca 2+ can be removed more easily than Mg 2+ as the latter has a larger hydrated radius. This set-up has an efficiency of 80%, which is highly dependent on the amount of Mg 2+ in the hard water. The performance of this softener is dependent on the enzyme stability and efficiency of cofactor cycling. This type of enzyme softener has been recommended for residential use. Work is in process to enhance the enzyme stability by various methods, of which immobilization has been given utmost priority. The other enzyme substitute has also been looked into, to make the process NAD + independent, namely glucose oxidase [81] .",

It can be either hydrophilic or hydrophobic, depending on environmental conditions. It contains polysaccharides (homo or heteropolysaccharides containing sugars like glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, pyruvate, mannuronic acid, glucoronic acid, etc.), proteins (10-200 kDa with ~40%-60% of hydrophobic amino acids), nucleic acids, lipids, and humic substances [83] . However, polysaccharides are the most important component as they provide adhesion to microbes on the surface. The composition of biofilm depends on microbial strain, stage of growth phase, limiting substrate (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus), oxygen limitation, ionic strength, temperature, and presence of shear force. A biofilm can be capsular (tight microbial binding) or slimy (loose microbial binding) depending on the constituents of the water.

Enzymes like cellulase, \u03b1-amylase, and \u03b2-glucanase are effective biofilm removal agents, regardless of enzyme source. However, enzymes like protease, \u03b2-glucosidase, aminopeptidase, \u03b2-galactosidase, lipase, phosphatase, and lipase assist in biofilm degradation. Generally, bacterial and fungal sources are preferred due to ease of enzyme isolation and purification. The best recipe for enzyme preparation obtained A. naeslundii, N. subflava, L. rhamnosus, P. gingivalis, S. oralis, S. mutans, V. dispar and S. sanguinis [Patent CA2001539A1, Patent US4936994, Patent EP0388115A1] containing \u03b1-amylase, lipase, \u03b2-glucanase and protease enzymes, which have been found most effective with respect to any other combinations [85] . Protease present in the combination helps in protein degradation and makes it highly labile to be easily acted on by other polysaccharases, most importantly \u03b1-amylases. [86] Enzymatic action has been found to be more effective, more time saving, and less laborious in removal of biofilm than any other methods known currently. However, this method has not been yet commercialized due to lack of technical set-up and the presence of lower-cost biocides prevailing in the market. Enzyme technology through enzyme immobilization has been suggested, which would be a help in commercializing enzyme-based biofilm removal at large scale in water treatment plants.",

In the case of a plant source, either plant tissue or sometimes whole plants are used, depending on the enzyme secretion being used for degradation of pollutants. For example, degradation of dyes like malachite green, methyl orange, and brilliant blue R4 uses the enzyme peroxidase secreted from the roots of Typhonium flagelliforme. However, the major disadvantage of introducing plant parts or a complete plant is the increase in BOD and COD of the water effluent, which complicates the complete water remediation process. Enzymes from microbial cells are much more effective in water remediation, as enzymes can be induced to be synthesized by microbial cells depending on the type of pollutant. However, induction requires modification of the growth media with the addition of essential nutrients, which is generally not possible with in situ water remediation by enzymes. [90] . Further, enzymes containing microbial cells for pollutant degradation do not initiate as soon as microbial cells are introduced into the water. They need time for acclimatization to recalcitrant pollutants present in wastewater, which makes complete water remediation more time-consuming and less effective. \u2022 Enzyme delivery as cell-free enzyme extracts: Cell extract containing the enzyme required for pollutant degradation is prepared through source lysis using chemical or physical methods. Here, the complexity of the growth medium as well as the time duration for acclimatization is not the issue being raised, thus making water remediation faster, simpler, and more cost effective. However, crude enzymes have lower catalytic efficiency than pure enzymes, in addition to the fact that pure enzymes are more susceptible to degradation by slight changes in the physico-chemical environment, which is not possible to control, particularly in wastewater heavily laden with recalcitrant pollutants [91] . \u2022 Enzyme delivery in immobilized form: This is the method best suited for introducing enzymes into wastewater without affecting enzyme conformation, an important factor in their catalytic activity. Enzymes are protected from extreme physico-chemical conditions like high temperature, very low or very high pH, high ionic strength, presence of inhibitors, etc., commonly found in polluted water. Further, this technique provides the additional benefit of increased reusability, making the complete process more cost effective with enhanced adaptability, easier handling, and higher specificity than any other known water treatment. Enzyme immobilization can be carried out by various means, such as adsorption, covalent binding, chemical coupling, etc. Enzyme matrices chosen for immobilization are well characterized with respect to their mechanical and hydrodynamic properties, filter characteristics, and biocidal properties, in addition to enzyme stability, reusability, and catalysis [44, [92] [93] [94] .",

Generally, enzymes used for water treatment are immobilized either by chemical coupling or covalent binding, as they provide increased reusability and more stability with minimal restrictions being imposed by pollutant diffusivity. However, there is a chance of enzyme inactivation when active sites are involved in enzyme attachment. In those cases, optimization is carried out with respect to the modifiers being used, and the conditions during enzyme immobilization are chosen with utmost care. Further, the enzyme immobilized by nanoparticles can be systematically moved from bench scale testing, followed by statistical analysis for lower volume systems, to commercialization for water treatment at pilot scale [95] . Thus complementing enzyme technology with nanotechnology would be very effective in water decontamination, due to removal of several drawbacks faced when used individually.",

            "text": "\u2022 Magnetic nanoparticles: These nanoparticles are much preferred over other nanoparticles for enzyme immobilization due to the presence of magnetism, which helps in easier separation of immobilized enzymes after water treatment. Most importantly, the superparamagnetic property of magnetic nanoparticles acts to retain magnetism in the presence of a magnetic field, while retaining no magnetism once the magnetic field is removed. Magnetic nanoparticles do not agglomerate and remain suspended in solution due to their supermagnetism, an important feature responsible for the excellent efficiency of immobilized enzymes. Further, the enzyme can be positioned accurately onto nanosized magnetic particles with the help of magnetic resonance imaging. In addition to providing enzyme stability and easier separation from the reaction mixture, magnetic nanoparticles are also used in sensing and monitoring various contaminants present in water. Generally, magnetic nanoparticles like FeO and Fe 2 O 3 are used for enzyme immobilization due to size uniformity and excellent electrical, optical, magnetic, and chemical properties. Sometimes, magnetic nanoparticles are surface modified with polymers (dextran, polyvinyl alcohol; PVA, diethylaminoethyl; DEAE-starch), silica, etc. based on the enzyme type and application. Water-remediating enzymes like cellulase, catalase, \u03b2-glucosidase, lipase, peroxidase, agarase, \u03ba-carrageenase, and laccase have been immobilized onto magnetic nanoparticles. Enzymes like alkaline phosphatase and glucose oxidase have been immobilized onto magnetic nanoparticles and are used for sensing and monitoring water contaminants [104] [105] [106] [107] . \u2022 Gold (Au) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles: Besides providing a large surface area for enzyme immobilization, Ag and Au nanoparticles exhibit excellent electronic, optical, and thermal properties and act as conduction centers to facilitate transfer of the electrons. These nanoparticles are highly versatile with respect to their size and structure, which makes them best suited for enzyme immobilization in water treatment as well as in the synthesis of biosensors. It has been found that they provide favorable orientation of enzyme immobilization (particularly redox enzymes) due to the presence of conducting channels between enzymes and the surface of nanoparticles. Thus they are helpful in imparting maximum stability and reusability to immobilized enzymes. However, they have a tendency of aggregating, due to having very high surface energy. Therefore, surface passivation of Ag and Au nanoparticles has been very important during enzyme immobilization. It can be done using citrate and thiol-functionalized organics, by self-assembling into monolayers, by encapsulation inside water pools of reverse microemulsions, etc. Generally, enzymes are immobilized onto Ag and Au nanoparticles using physical and covalent (direct and through cross-linker) adsorption. The covalent method is the more preferred, as it imparts better stability and versatility of enzyme immobilization. However, the covalent method often leads to enzyme inactivation as compared to the physical method. The covalent method involves functionalization of Ag and Au nanoparticles using cysteamine or cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), followed by either direct enzyme addition or after addition of a spacer (glutaraldehyde). Spacer-based enzyme immobilization is more effective, as there is less chance of enzyme inactivation and this technique imparts better catalytic efficiency. There should be intensive optimization, particularly the ratio of functionalization reagent and spacer, to minimize excessive aggregation and enzyme inactivation. CTAB-based enzyme immobilization has been generally used for water-treating enzymes; however, it requires a larger amount of enzyme for immobilization. Water-treating enzymes that are immobilized onto Ag and Au nanoparticles are: lipase, peroxidase, keratinase, \u03b1-amylase, esterase, urease, endoglucanase, carboxypeptidase, and laccase. Further, sensing and monitoring enzymes immobilized onto Ag and Au nanoparticles are: choline oxidase, glucose oxidase, and tyrosinase [108] [109] [110] [111] . \u2022 Chitosan nanoparticles: Chitosan is a hydrophilic, positively charged biopolymer with uniform dispersion, molecular mobility, relaxation behavior, and adaptable thermal and mechanical properties. These nanoparticles have size versatility ranging from a nanometer to a millimeter, which is helpful in immobilizing variety of enzymes as well as also helpful in types of applications. However, the smaller the size of the chitosan nanoparticle, the greater is its immobilization efficiency. Further, they do not have any magnetic properties and have higher fragility with respect to any nanoparticles being used for enzyme immobilization. Enzyme immobilization onto chitosan nanoparticles is much easier without requirement of any additional chemical reagent due to presence of number of active functional groups. There is proper distribution of enzyme molecules onto chitosan nanoparticles due to regular arrangement of active functional groups onto the surface of chitosan nanoparticles. Enzymes immobilized onto chitosan nanoparticles are highly stable towards adverse physicochemical conditions (pH, temperature, ionic strength), resistant to proteases and various denaturing compounds. Chitosan nanoparticles provide an ideal microenvironment for enzyme catalysis in water treatment. Various watertreating enzymes immobilized onto chitosan nanoparticles are: lipase, laccase, peroxidase, invertase, cellulase, esterase, phytase, neutral proteinase, keratinase, glucoamylase, and \u03b1-amylase. A sensing and monitoring enzyme immobilized onto chitosan nanoparticles is alkaline phosphatase [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] . \u2022 CNTs: These form one of the excellent matrices for enzyme immobilization due to their cylindrical shape, with the length in micrometers while the diameter is 100 nm. The surface of the nanotubes can be single layered (SWCNT) or multilayered (MWCNT), which provides better versatility to enzyme immobilization. However, SWCNTs are preferred, as they provide a larger surface area for enzyme interaction, while MWCNTs are cost effective and have easier dispersibility. CNTs provide high mechanical strength, are chemically inert, have excellent thermal conductivity, and are environmentally stable. Enzyme immobilization requires chemical functionalization by oxidizing sidewalls using HNO 3 , H 2 SO 4 , KMnO 4 , O 3 which helps in introducing functional groups like carboxylic acid, hydroxyl, phenol, carbonyl and quinone groups onto the nanotube's surface. These functional groups are used for covalent enzyme binding through esterification, thiolation, alkylation, and arylation. In some cases, enzyme molecules are trapped inside the hollow channel of the nanotube by simple adsorption. CNTs can also be modified with magnetic nanoparticles or complex (chitosan and magnetic nanoparticles) to attain their additional qualities, and it is also helpful in preventing nanoparticle aggregation after enzyme immobilization inside reaction mixtures. Water-treating enzymes that are immobilized onto CNTs are: lipase, laccase, peroxidase, and cellulase. Further, a sensing and monitoring enzyme immobilized onto CNTs is glucose oxidase. Sometimes a specific protocol has to be designed for a particular enzyme immobilization, for example, enzyme peroxidase can be actively immobilized onto MWCNTs by covalent linkage onto a functionalized nanotube surface with cross-linker (glutaraldehyde), followed by blocking of nonbound functional groups using N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) or N-ethyl-N\u2032-3dimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). Immobilized peroxidise onto MWCNTs are found to be highly stable and catalytically active for the degradation of recalcitrant compounds present in waste water. Treated water can be monitored with immobilized enzymes (glucose oxidase and peroxidase) onto complex chitosan-SWCNTs [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] . \u2022 Silica nanoparticles: Enzymes are immobilized onto silica nanoparticles via covalent linkage using silanol groups present on their surface. Silica nanoparticles impart excellent enzyme stability and are less toxic due to fabrication. During enzyme immobilization, silanol groups present on the surface of silica nanoparticles are functionalized with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane to generate -NH 2 followed by addition of glutaraldehyde (act as a cross-linker), which provides aldehyde groups to enzymes as well as aminolyted silica nanoparticles containing -NH 2 and forms imine bonds in both cases. The size of silica nanoparticles can easily be controlled based on synthesis protocols; they are biocompatible and provide a very large surface area with an abundance of sites for surface functionalization. These features are responsible for excellent immobilization efficiency and better catalysis by immobilized enzymes. In addition, immobilized enzymes are less susceptible to damage by adverse physical and chemical conditions like pH, temperature, organic solvents, ionic strength, etc. Further, a minimal amount of aggregation has been observed in the case of immobilized enzymes kept in the reaction mixture for longer duration. Water-treating enzymes immobilized onto silica nanoparticles are lipase, peroxidase, \u03b1-amylase, and keratinase; while sensing and monitoring enzymes immobilized onto silica nanoparticles are catalase and glucose oxidase [122] [123] [124] [125] .",

            "text": "Water treatment using nanoparticles with attached enzymes (combo-technology) has been found to be more efficient and less toxic. Lab experimentation has found this technology to be very useful in effective removal of recalcitrant pollutants and combining the two is complementary. However, the combo-technology has not yet arrived on the market due to various challenges. The foremost of these are scale-up optimization, unstable physical states due to aggregation, and determination of an accurate number of cycles of reusability. Nanoparticles have gained more attention in enzyme immobilization, as they present a very high surface-to-volume ratio, leading to very high immobilization efficiency. The major problem that has been frequently observed is that immobilized enzyme on nanoparticles has a higher tendency of aggregating during storage. Microparticles with larger size, though not having higher immobilizing efficiency, at least have a tendency to aggregate due to less surface energy [126] . The optimal conditions under which aggregation of immobilized enzyme onto nanoparticles can be minimized have not yet been determined. Aggregation leads to heterogeneity and lowers the efficiency of water treatment. It has been found that removal of immobilized enzyme from the reaction medium after catalysis can help in minimizing aggregation. This creates a nuisance, however, as separation of immobilized enzyme (onto nanoparticles) is not an easy job due to the very small size. The concept is then to look for those nanoparticles that have less surface energy and can be separated due to added properties like magnetism. Enzymes immobilized onto magnetic nanoparticles can easily be separated from the reaction medium with the application of a magnetic field. Further, magnetic nanoparticles have less tendency to aggregate when the enzyme covers their surface by immobilization. However, magnetic nanoparticles cannot be used for immobilization of all types of enzymes. Chitosan nanoparticles have been found to be very useful in this respect; however, they themselves have no characteristics for taking part in any water treatment. Therefore, hybrid magnetic chitosan nanoparticles have been made containing a magnetic coating (such as Fe 3 O 4 -chitosan nanoparticles) by using methods like microemulsion polymerization, or in situ polymerization. They have a very small tendency of aggregation and present very high immobilization efficiency. Further, they provide excellent enzyme stability with higher number of reusability cycles [127] . Magnetic chitosan nanoparticles are resistant to corrosion and offer higher flexibility with respect to functional groups. It has been found that they are a better sensor for monitoring the level of recalcitrant pollutants in treated water [128] . Similar types of nanoparticles are being explored that can fulfill all the requirements mentioned previously.",

They have exceeded the performance of conventional methods for removal of complex and recalcitrant pollutants in a less expensive manner, but there is still a long way to go before these products are accepted in the commercial market. Toxicological studies must be done despite claims of the nontoxicity of enzyme-immobilized nanoparticles with experimental evidence. The phenomenon of nanoparticle aggregation has to be properly taken care of, as it is one of the major reasons for biological system toxicity. Nanoparticle aggregation has been a major reason for disruption of the aquatic food chain, thus playing an important role in the collapsing aquatic ecosystem. Therefore, eco-friendly water treatment would be more effective, sustainable, and acceptable by every section of society.",
