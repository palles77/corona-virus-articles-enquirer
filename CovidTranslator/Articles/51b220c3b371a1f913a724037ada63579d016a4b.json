Each myofiber is composed of many closely packed myofibrils containing actin and myosin filaments. The striations visible with light microscopy ( Fig. 15-2) represent the sarcomeric arrangement of muscle cells, in which actin and myosin filaments attached to transverse Z bands form the framework, and other organelles and intracytoplasmic materials are interspersed within this framework ( Fig. 15-3) . The endoplasmic reticulum of myofibers is called the sarcoplasmic reticulum and is modified to contain terminal cisternae that sequester the calcium ions necessary to initiate actin and myosin interaction and thus contraction. Sarcolemmal invaginations that traverse the cell, the T (for transverse) tubules, allow rapid dispersion of a sarcolemmal action potential to all portions of the myofiber. The terminal cisternae of two adjacent sarcomeres and the T tubule form what is called the triad (Fig. 15-3, A) .",

A common classification of these fibers is based on three major physiologic features: (1) rates of contraction (fast or slow), (2) rates of fatigue (fast or slow), and (3) types of metabolism (oxidative, glycolytic, or mixed). These physiologic differences form the basis of histochemical methods that demonstrate fiber types. There are several fiber-type classifications. Classification of fibers into type 1, type 2A, and type 2B (Table 15 -1) has proved to have practical application in muscle pathology. It is the classification used in this text. Type 1 fibers are rich in mitochondria, rely heavily on oxidative metabolism, and are slow-contracting and slow-fatiguing. acid and alkaline preparations, which is a distinguishing feature. In most species, oxidative enzyme reactions to demonstrate mitochondria also demonstrate fiber types to some degree ( Fig. 15-6, A) . Fiber typing can also be done by utilizing immunohistochemical procedures to identify specific myosin isoforms.",

Type 1 predominant postural muscles are most often located deep in the limb. Within the same muscle, the percentage of type 1 fibers often increases in the deeper portions. Muscles that contract quickly and for short periods of time, such as those designed for sprinting, contain more type 2B fibers.

The terminal branches form synapses with the myofibers at the neuromuscular junction. The myofibers innervated by a single axon form a motor unit, all fibers of which will contract simultaneously after stimulation. Different muscles have different sized motor units that relate to their function. For example, extraocular muscle function does not call for forceful contraction but, rather, for many fine movements to smoothly move the globe. Therefore these muscles have very small motor units, with only a small number of myofibers (1 to 4) innervated by each axon. In contrast, the quadriceps muscle is not designed for fine movement but instead is designed for generation of force; therefore motor units are quite large, with many myofibers (100 to 150 or more) innervated by a single axon.",

The physiologic attributes of a muscle fiber-its rate of contraction and type of metabolism (oxidative, anaerobic, or mixed)-are determined not by the muscle cell itself but by the motor neuron responsible for its innervation ( Fig. 15-8) . This fact is significant in evaluating histologic changes in muscle fibers. It is possible to divide changes in muscle fibers into two major classes: neuropathic and myopathic. Neuropathic changes are those that are determined by the effect or the absence of the nerve supply (e.g., atrophy after denervation). The term myopathy should be reserved for those muscle diseases in which the primary change takes place in the muscle cell, not in the interstitial tissue and not secondary to effects from the nerve supply.

Type 1 oxidative and type 2A oxidative-glycolytic fibers use aerobic metabolism of glucose, stored in the muscle as glycogen, and fat. Type 2B glycolytic fibers rely primarily on anaerobic metabolism of glycogen for energy. Inherent or acquired metabolic defects that reduce skeletal muscle energy production can result in severe muscle dysfunction. A commonly encountered postmortem change, rigor mortis, illustrates the importance of ATP generation within skeletal muscle. The muscle contractile apparatus is still active immediately after death. ATP is necessary for the release of actin from myosin, the interaction that results in the sliding of myofilaments and contraction of muscle. After death, the absence of adequate ATP production causes the muscle fibers to undergo sustained contraction, which is known as rigor mortis. Rigor mortis eventually disappears because of muscle structural breakdown caused by autolysis or putrefaction (bacterial decomposition). The period of time for onset and release of rigor mortis varies, depending on physiologic (glycogen stores at the time of death) and environmental factors such as the environmental temperature (see Chapter 1). Skeletal muscle is also excitable tissue, similar to that of the nervous system. Maintenance of proper ionic gradients across the sarcolemma is essential for initiation of the action potential. Internal ionic gradients, especially of calcium ions, are critical for initiation and termination of contraction. Alterations of ionic fluxes across the sarcolemma, or within the sarcoplasmic reticulum, can have a serious negative impact on myofiber function. ",

Abnormal spontaneous activity includes wave forms designated as positive sharp waves, fibrillations, and myotonic bursts. These abnormal spontaneous electrical events are associated with characteristic sounds emitted by the EMG machine. Abnormal spontaneous activity, typically dense and sustained fibrillations and sharp waves, is generated in denervated muscle because of alteration in sodium channel activity in the membrane of denervated fibers. Spontaneous activity in degenerative myopathies, usually scattered fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and myotonic bursts, is likely related to ionic disturbances associated with fiber degeneration and regeneration; functional denervation after segmental necrosis of the segment containing the neuromuscular junction is also possible.

Pale streaking of muscle most often reflects myofiber necrosis and mineralization (see Fig. 15 -9, A and B) or infiltration by collagen or fat (see C and D) , and it is one of the more reliable indicators of gross pathologic changes. Muscle parasites can be grossly visible as discrete, round to oval, pale and slightly firm zones (see A) . Dark red mottling of skeletal muscle can indicate congestion, hemorrhage, hemorrhagic necrosis (see A, , inflammation, or myoglobin staining after massive muscle damage (see Fig. 15 -35, A) or can simply reflect vascular stasis (hypostatic congestion) after death. Hemorrhagic streaks within the diaphragm often accompany death caused by acute exsanguination. A green discoloration can indicate either eosinophilic inflammation or severe putrefaction. Lipofuscin accumulation in old animals, especially cattle, can cause a tan-brown discoloration of muscle. Black discoloration of the fascia occurs in calves with melanosis as an incidental finding and in older gray horses with metastasis of dermal melanoma to muscle fascia.",

            "text": "Increased intracellular calcium is a common trigger of necrosis in all cells, and myofibers contain a high level of calcium ions stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Therefore myofibers may be particularly sensitive to calcium-induced necrosis, either as a result of damage to the sarcolemma, causing influx of extracellular calcium, or from damage to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, releasing intracellular stores of calcium. Small wonder then that necrotic myofibers are often prone to overt mineralization. Overtly mineralized myofibers appear as chalky white streaks on gross examination (see Fig. 15 -9, A) and as basophilic granular to crystalline material within myofibers on histologic examination. Large deposits of mineral can induce a foreign body granulomatous response. Although the presence or absence of myofiber mineralization has sometimes been used as a diagnostic aid, the circumstances under which a necrotic myofiber segment can become mineralized are so diverse that myofiber Careful microscopic examination of multiple muscles is often required to detect lesions. In cases of suspected neuromuscular disease, multiple muscle samples should include active muscle (tongue, diaphragm, intercostals, and masticatory muscles), proximal muscle (lateral triceps, biceps femoris, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and gluteal), and distal muscle (extensor carpi radialis and cranial tibial). For purposes of a biopsy, certain muscles (e.g., lateral triceps, biceps femoris, cranial tibial, semimembranosus, and semitendinosus) are easier to sample because of their parallel myofiber orientation. The ideal samples will also vary, depending on the suspected disorder, such as a type 1 predominant postural muscle for diagnosis of equine motor neuron disease, a type 2 predominant locomotory muscle for diagnosis of equine polysaccharide storage myopathy (EPSSM), and temporal or masseter muscle for diagnosis of masticatory myositis in dogs and masseter myopathy in horses. Short fibers, such as those in the intercostal muscle, are preferred for physiologic studies in which intact muscle fibers are necessary and for studies of neuromuscular junction zones.",

Actually, muscle is a remarkably adaptive tissue, with a wide range of response to physiologic and pathologic conditions. Myofibers can add or delete sarcomeres to cause elongation or shortening of the entire muscle. In addition to necrosis and regeneration, myofibers can atrophy and hypertrophy, they can split, they can undergo a variety of cytoarchitectural alterations, and they can completely alter their physiologic functions when undergoing fiber-type conversion. To describe muscle response to injury as stereotypical does not do justice to this inherent plasticity. What is true, though, is that it is frequently not possible to determine the cause of muscle injury based on gross or histologic lesions alone. Supplementary tests and clinical histories are often essential.",

A, Types of muscle clamps (from left to right): disposable plastic clamps (open and closed), stainless steel clamps (open and closed), a gallbladder clamp (unmodified), and a modified gallbladder clamp. The stainless steel clamps are autoclavable, the best but expensive. A suitable and economical clamp (not shown) can be made by welding a bar approximately 1 cm long, 3 to 5 mm wide, and 3 mm thick between the lower jaws of two small hemostats. B, Final excision stage. Initially two longitudinal incisions, approximately 5 mm apart and 15 mm long, are made into the muscle in the direction of the myofibers. A horizontal cut is made 3 to 4 mm below the surface to undermine a piece of muscle. One jaw of the clamp is inserted under the muscle until its tip just exits on the other side. The clamp is lifted several millimeters above the surface of the muscle to ensure that the muscle fibers are tense and then the jaws are clamped. The clamped piece of muscle is excised by cutting at each end adjacent to the clamp as shown above. The muscle sample, still in the clamps, is placed in the fixative, usually 10% BNF, for histopathologic examination and fixed overnight. For fixation for electron microscopic examination, the muscle in the clamp is placed into EM fixative for 1 to 2 hours. For histopathologic examination, the muscle is trimmed by freeing the strip of muscle between the clamps by cutting immediately adjacent to the clamp jaws. Then a transverse section is cut from one end of this sample, avoiding any crushed area, and the remainder of the sample is cut longitudinally in the direction of the myofibers. Both samples are desirable for histopathologic examination. For electron microscopy, after fixation for 1 to 2 hours, slivers 0.5 to 1 mm thick are shaved from the outside of the sample. These are cut into pieces 0.2 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm long, with the longer dimension being in the direction of the myofibers. This long sample facilitates embedment so that the fibers are oriented either in cross section or longitudinally. Both sections are required for electron microscopy. C, Pinning strips of muscle onto a rigid surface, such as a piece of tongue depressor before immersion in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, will also minimize fixation artifacts but is not as effective as the clamps shown above. Myofiber diameters, cytoarchitectural changes, and the percentage of abnormal myofibers are most reliably evaluated in transverse sections. Longitudinal sections reveal the length of changes such as segmental necrosis or regeneration or deposition of storage material. Improperly oriented samples, which result in sections that have obliquely oriented myofibers and thus neither longitudinal nor transverse myofibers, are difficult to evaluate. Use of a magnifying glass or dissecting microscope can aid in determining the orientation of myofibers during trimming of muscle before sectioning. Routine stains, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), run the risk of offering the pathologist a \"vast pink wasteland\" for evaluation and are often inadequate for detecting subtle myopathic changes, lesions within intramuscular nerves, or the presence of abnormal stored material. Various special stains, including reticulin, Masson trichrome, von Kossa, lipid (performed on frozen sections of fixed samples), and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) for glycogen, are often invaluable in the evaluation of routinely processed skeletal muscle (E- For many decades, myofiber typing could be done only on frozen sections using the myosin ATPase reaction. Recently, immunohistochemical staining of myosin has been developed for demonstration of myofiber types in formalin-fixed muscle. This is a major advantage because fiber-type staining is often essential for the complete evaluation of muscle. It is most useful in demonstrating preferential involvement of a fiber type and alteration of the fiber-type pattern, the result of denervation and reinnervation.",

Muscle satellite cells are resistant to many of the insults that result in myofiber necrosis, and activation of satellite cells is triggered by necrosis of adjacent segments of that myofiber. Therefore, as macrophages are clearing cytoplasmic debris, satellite cells are becoming activated and begin to divide in preparation for regeneration of the affected myofiber segment. If the myofiber basal lamina is still intact, it will leave an empty cylindrical space known as a sarcolemmal tube. This name is clearly a misnomer, dating from the days when the term sarcolemma was applied to the and all the visible portion of the lower fiber have undergone necrosis, and macrophages have invaded through the intact basal lamina and cleared the cytoplasmic debris. Satellite cells on the inner surface of the basal lamina of the lower fiber are activated, and one (lower left side) is in mitosis. One-micron-thick plastic-embedded section, H&E stain. B, Polyphasic injury, segmental coagulation necrosis and regeneration of myofibers, muscle, longitudinal section. Between each of the foci of coagulation necrosis in the lowest myofiber is a segment of smalldiameter faintly basophilic cytoplasm lacking cross-striations, in which there is an internal chain of euchromatic nuclei. This is a late stage of regeneration. Formalin fixation, H&E stain. C, Monophasic injury, late-stage regeneration, skeletal muscle, longitudinal section. The regenerating segment of the myofiber consists of myotubes, which have small diameters, with slightly basophilic cytoplasm and internal rows of large euchromatic nuclei. B C A tube formed by the basal lamina that remains after segmental myofiber necrosis. Clearly what is now termed the sarcolemma (plasmalemma) of necrotic fiber segments is lost, but this is a misnomer that is firmly entrenched. The important concept to remember is that, if intact, the basal lamina forms a cylindrical scaffold to guide proliferating myoblasts and to keep fibroblasts out. Satellite cells may be seen undergoing mitosis, at which stage they are known as activated myoblasts, on the inner surface of this tube (see Fig. 15-13, A) . Within hours, proliferating myoblasts will fuse end-to-end to form myotubes ( Fig. 15-13 , B and C), and within days the myotube produces thick and thin filaments and undergoes maturation to a myofiber, reestablishing myofiber integrity. If the basal lamina is ruptured, myotubes are said to be able to bridge gaps of 2 to 4 mm and larger ones heal by fibrosis (see later discussion). The process of myofiber regeneration recapitulates embryologic development of skeletal muscle and is depicted schematically in Fig. 15-14 . A percentage of dividing satellite cells do not fuse with the forming myotube but instead become new satellite cells capable of future regeneration. In summary, the success of muscle regeneration depends on (1) the presence of an intact basal lamina and (2) the availability of viable satellite cells. The stages of successful muscle regeneration are summarized in Box 15-2.",

Because the basal lamina is not intact, there is no tube to guide the myoblasts proliferating from each end. Myoblast proliferation under these conditions results in formation of so-called muscle giant cells ( Fig. 15-15 ). Thus the presence of muscle giant cells indicates that conditions for regeneration have not been optimal and occurs after destructive lesions, such as those caused by trauma that transects myofibers, infarction, and intramuscular bacterial infection or injection of irritants. Muscle giant cells are often accompanied by fibrosis, which will unite the ends of the damaged myofibers. This also occurs in muscle damaged by invasive or metastatic sclerosing carcinomas. Cytokines released from damaged muscle fibers contribute to the signaling pathways that initiate macrophage infiltration and regeneration, but they also contribute to interstitial fibroblast activation.

Pathologic classification of degenerative myopathies is enhanced by use of the terms monophasic necrosis and polyphasic necrosis. Monophasic lesions are of the same duration, indicative of a single insult. Polyphasic lesions indicate an ongoing degenerative process. Thus a focal monophasic lesion could be the result of a single traumatic incident such as an intramuscular injection (see Fig. 15-9, B) .

Using this approach, it is sometimes possible to rule out a diagnosis (e.g., muscular dystrophy and selenium deficiency myopathy are typically polyphasic), but this is not an invariable rule.

In some species (e.g., horse, cat, and human beings), there are three distinct populations based on diameter: Type 1 fibers are the smallest, type 2B fibers are the largest, and type 2A fibers are intermediate in size. Different sizes in diameters are in part a reflection of the oxidative needs of the fibers; oxygen diffuses more readily into the interior of small-diameter fibers. In the dog, all fiber types are oxidative, and fiber-type diameter is much more uniform. A histogram generated from morphometric analysis of fiber diameters will reveal the characteristics of individual muscles in various species. Not surprisingly, this type of detailed information is more readily available for human patients than for animals. Even without morphometric analysis, however, a pathologist experienced in examination of muscle can often determine whether there is a normal fiber-size distribution (based on fiber diameter in transverse section) or whether there is an increase in fiber-size variation. The finding of increased fiber-size variation suggests that something is wrong but in itself does not give any indication of cause.

In the early stages of atrophy, it may be difficult or impossible to detect loss of muscle mass by gross observation, and morphometric evaluation of myofiber diameters may be required. Several cellular physiologic processes can be activated to result in muscle atrophy. These include induction of lysosomal action to result in autophagy of cytoplasmic components, apoptosis (programmed cell death), and activation of the cytoplasmic ubiquitin-proteosomal machinery. Lysosomal activation is prominent in denervation atrophy and is the basis for the positive reaction of denervated fibers in alkaline phosphatase and nonspecific esterase preparations. The causes of muscle fiber atrophy include physiologic and metabolic processes and denervation. In most instances, muscle atrophy is reversible provided the cause is corrected. The type of fiber undergoing atrophy varies, depending on the cause; therefore fiber typing is often required for Muscle nuclei disappear from the necrotic segment and the sarcoplasm becomes hyalinized (eosinophilic, amorphous, and homogeneous) because of the loss of normal myofibrillar structure (see Fig. 15-15, B) . The necrotic portion may separate from the adjacent viable myofiber (see Fig. 15 B; A and B; C) .",

Muscle atrophy caused by cachexia can be profound, especially in cases of cancer cachexia in which increased circulating levels of TNF alter the muscle metabolism, favoring catabolic processes rather than anabolic processes.

Maintenance of normal myofiber diameter depends on trophic factors generated by an intact associated nerve. Loss of neural input results in rapid muscle atrophy, and more than half the muscle mass of a completely denervated muscle can be lost in a few weeks. This trophic effect is not dependent on contractile activity because denervation atrophy is not a feature of neuromuscular junction disorders such as botulism and myasthenia gravis. In these disorders, there is a failure of neuromuscular transmission, but the nerve to the muscle is intact; therefore the muscle is technically still innervated. Generalized neuropathies or neuronopathies, such as equine motor neuron disease, result in widespread and symmetric muscle atrophy. More commonly, however, only select nerve damage is present, resulting in asymmetric muscle atrophy. One example is equine laryngeal hemiplegia (roaring) secondary to damage to the left recurrent laryngeal nerve ( Fig. 15-16) . Note that purely demyelinating disorders of peripheral nerves can cause profound Denervation: Type 1 and type 2 fibers; reinnervation leads to altered fiber-type patterns (fiber-type grouping) Disuse: Predominantly type 2 fibers; may vary, depending on the species and cause Endocrine disease: Predominantly type 2 fibers; associated with hypothyroidism and hypercortisolism Malnutrition, cachexia, and senility: Predominantly type 2 fibers Congenital myopathy: Often predominantly type 1 fibers B A of denervation followed by reinnervation. What appears to be fibertype grouping can also occur because of fiber-type conversion (most often to type 1 fibers) in chronic myopathic conditions. Careful evaluation of the structure and function of peripheral nerves helps distinguish neuropathic from myopathic changes. If previously reinnervated fibers are denervated again, the pattern includes large groups of atrophied fibers of a single fiber type, a process known as type-specific group atrophy. Type-specific group atrophy is far less common in animals than in human beings. Fiber-type grouping and type-specific group atrophy can only be detected by methods that distinguish fiber types. Changes occurring as a result of denervation and reinnervation are illustrated in Fig. 15 -19.",

Mechanical overloading of hypertrophied muscle fibers is also possible. For example, overloading of hypertrophied fibers can result in segmental necrosis of the hypertrophied fibers (see Fig. 15-17, B) , or fibers can undergo longitudinal fiber splitting to generate one or more smaller-diameter \"fibers,\" all contained within the same basal lamina (Fig. 15-20) . Serial sections of areas of fiber splitting generally reveal that splits do not extend the entire length of the myofiber. Fiber splitting is considered a form of cytoarchitectural alteration (see later discussion). Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is an important molecular signal involved in skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Genetic inactivation of the regulatory gene myostatin results in muscle hypertrophy caused by an increase in the number of myofibers.",

Compensatory hypertrophy occurs because of pathologic conditions that (1) decrease the number of functional myofibers and therefore increase the load on remaining fibers or (2) interfere with normal cellular metabolic or other physiologic processes. Compensatory myofiber hypertrophy is therefore considered a relatively nonspecific response to a variety of insults. Fibers undergoing compensatory hypertrophy can enlarge to more than 100 \u00b5m in diameter (normal is less than approximately 60 to 70 \u00b5m). Fiber hypertrophy often accompanies fiber atrophy, which contributes to increased fiber-size variation in various myopathic and neuropathic conditions. Compensatory hypertrophy can occur because of a decrease in the number of functional myofibers. Thus, in a partially denervated muscle, the remaining innervated fibers hypertrophy (see Fig. 15-17 , B), presumably as a result of increased workload. Pathologically, hypertrophied fibers have less oxygen diffusion from interstitial capillaries to internal portions of the myofiber because of the increase in the distance from the capillary to the internal portions of the A, Terminal axon branches innervate multiple myofibers, and myofiber type is determined by the electrical activity of the type of neuron innervating the myofiber. Normally the terminal axons of the motor units are intermingled, with the result that the differently stained myofiber types form a mosaic pattern. B, If a neuron (or axon) is damaged, the axon will undergo Wallerian degeneration, and the myofibers in that motor unit will undergo denervation atrophy. Small group atrophy is illustrated here. C, Axonal sprouts from a healthy neuron can reinnervate affected fibers and cause restoration of their normal diameter. The myofibers will assume the fiber type of the new motor unit, which often causes fiber-type conversion, leading to fiber-type grouping. D, If neuronal (or axonal) damage is progressive, denervation atrophy of large groups of fibers of a single type can occur, known as type-specific group atrophy.

Internal nuclei are rare in normal mammalian muscle, but a small percentage can be found normally in avian and reptilian species. Rows of internal nuclei in small-diameter, slightly basophilic myofibers are characteristic of the myotubular stage of regeneration (see Fig. 15 -13, B and C). In most species, myonuclei return to the normal peripheral location early in regeneration, within days of myotube formation. Rodents are the exception. In rodents, internal nuclei are retained after regeneration, which, in these species, provides a handy marker for identification of fibers that have undergone necrosis and regeneration. In other mammalian species, the presence of internal nuclei in normal or hypertrophied fibers is a nonspecific finding indicative of chronic myopathic change ; see Box 15-3).

The duration of ischemia determines the severity of necrosis and the success of regeneration (see the section on Necrosis and Regeneration). Postanesthetic myopathy is a monophasic, multifocal necrosis.

The resulting compromise of blood circulation leads to ischemic myodegeneration, which is known as compartment syndrome. The phenomenon of compartment syndrome is best illustrated in the anterior tibial muscle of human beings after strenuous exercise. This condition is believed to be a consequence of swelling of the anterior tibial muscle, which is surrounded anteriorly by the inelastic anterior fascial sheath and posteriorly by the tibia. Swelling impedes blood supply, resulting in ischemia. A similar phenomenon occurs in muscles surrounded by tight fascia in animals, particularly horses. Horses that are recumbent because of general anesthesia can develop compartment syndrome affecting gluteal or lateral triceps muscles. Horses can also develop compartment syndrome in gluteal muscles because of exertional rhabdomyolysis and in temporal and masseter muscles because of selenium deficiency. Compartment syndrome is also possible in the temporal and masseter muscles of dogs with masticatory myositis. duration of blockage. Because of the numerous anastomoses, blockage of capillaries causes less severe ischemia but can result in segmental myofiber necrosis, which is usually multifocal and if the cause is ongoing, polyphasic, with regenerating and necrotic myofibers. However, when larger arteries are blocked, whole areas of muscle, including the satellite cells, are killed, resulting in a monophasic necrosis and healing by fibrosis. Ischemia can also cause peripheral nerve damage and neuropathy, leading to denervation atrophy of intact myofibers.",

External trauma to muscle includes crush injury, lacerations and surgical incisions, tearing caused by excessive stretching or exercise, burns, gunshot and arrow wounds, and certain injections. Some of these result in complete or partial rupture of a large muscle. The diaphragm is the most common muscle to rupture and in dogs and cats is most often the result of a sudden increase in intraabdominal pressure such as from being hit by a car. In horses, diaphragmatic rupture is thought to occur most often during falls in which the pressure of the abdominal viscera causes diaphragmatic damage. A partial rupture of a muscle results in a tear in the fascial sheath, through which the muscle can herniate during contraction. In racing greyhounds, spontaneous rupture of muscles, such as the longissimus, quadriceps, biceps femoris, gracilis, triceps brachii, and gastrocnemius, can occur during strenuous exercise. In horses, damage to the origin of the gastrocnemius muscle has been linked to overexertion during exercise or while struggling to rise. Tearing of muscle fibers occurs in the adductor muscles of the hind limbs of cattle doing the \"splits\" (sudden bilateral abduction) on a slippery floor. Because there is often extensive disruption of the myofibers' Damage to intramuscular blood vessels will also cause myofiber necrosis. Vasculitis can cause areas of muscle damage (e.g., in horses with immune-mediated purpura hemorrhagica because of Streptococcus equi infection [see Fig. 15 -32] and in pigs with erysipelas). Viral diseases that target blood vessels of many organs, such as bluetongue in sheep, can also affect muscle. Exotoxins produced by clostridial organisms cause myositis and severe localized vascular damage, leading to hemorrhage and myofiber necrosis.

The trace mineral selenium is a vital component of the glutathione peroxidase system, which helps to protect cells from oxidative injury. The high oxygen requirement combined with contractile activity makes striated muscle, both skeletal and cardiac, particularly sensitive to oxidative injury. Neonatal animals, which rely on stores of selenium accumulated during gestation, are most frequently affected. Affected muscle is pale as a result of necrosis (see Fig. 15 -39), thus the common name white muscle disease.

Gram-stained tissue can be used to differentiate between the clusters of Gram-positive cocci in Staphylococcus infection, the Gram-positive bacilli causing actinomycosis (Actinomyces bovis), and the Gram-negative bacilli causing actinobacillosis (Actinobacillus lignieresii).",

The term myositis ossificans is a misnomer, because the lesion does not involve inflammation, but it has attained the status of acceptance by common usage. Myositis ossificans is a focal lesion usually confined to a single muscle and has been seen in horses, dogs, and human beings. The lesion is essentially a focal zone of fibrosis with osseous metaplasia, often with a zonal pattern. The central zone contains proliferating undifferentiated cells and fibroblasts; the middle one, osteoblasts depositing osteoid and immature bone; and the outer one, trabecular bone, which may be being remodeled by osteoclasts. These lesions can cause pain and lameness, which are often cured by surgical excision. A connective tissue disorder in cats, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, has been inappropriately called myositis ossificans. Musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis has so far been described only in horses and human beings. It is a progressive intramuscular fibromatosis that has also been called a desmoid tumor. Musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis is not, however, considered to be a true neoplastic process. Progressive dissecting intramuscular fibrosis accompanied by myofiber atrophy are the characteristic features. In most cases, the extent of intramuscular involvement makes surgical excision impossible, although wide excision of early lesions has proved to be curative.",

These two disorders are degenerative myopathies, not inflammatory myopathies. It is vitally important to distinguish between a true myositis and a degenerative myopathy in which there is a secondary inflammatory response. In the normal response to the myofiber necrosis, the necrotic segment is infiltrated by macrophages recruited from the circulating monocyte population (see B, , which phagocytose the cellular debris. Severe acute necrotizing myopathy can also be accompanied by a certain degree of infiltrating lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils. Cytokines released from damaged muscle fibers are likely to recruit a variety of inflammatory cells under various circumstances, but these cells are not involved in causing the muscle cell damage. True myositis occurs only when inflammatory cells are directly responsible for initiating and maintaining myofiber injury and when inflammation is directed at the myofibers and not at the stroma. In some cases, it may take careful evaluation of the overall tissue changes, an understanding of the probable underlying cause, and years of experience with muscle pathology to differentiate a florid cellular response with macrophages on a \"cleanup\" mission from true inflammation. Lymphocytic myositis must also be distinguished from lymphoma involving skeletal muscle (see the section on Neoplasia).",

Rarely, immune-mediated myositis occurs in cats and horses. Infiltrating lymphocytes, most often cytotoxic T lymphocytes, are the cause of myofiber injury. Although cytotoxic T lymphocytes are the effector cells causing myofiber damage, the inflammatory infiltrate is a mixture of lymphocyte types. The characteristic histologic pattern of immune-mediated myositis is an interstitial and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration ( Fig. 15-27 , A; see also , often with invasion of intact myofibers by lymphocytes ( Fig. 15-27,  B) . A variety of forms of immune-mediated myositis occur in the dog and can be localized to specific muscles, presumably because of unique myosin isoforms within those muscles. These are listed in Table 15 -7. Acquired myasthenia gravis is also an immune-mediated disease and is included in this table for completeness, but this is a disorder causing damage to the neuromuscular junction rather than to myofibers. In cats, feline immunodeficiency virus infection is a cause of immune-mediated myositis. In horses, lesions consistent with immune-mediated myositis are occasionally found after exposure to Streptococcus equi ssp. equi or infection with equine influenza virus. Note that small perivascular and interstitial infiltrates of lymphocytes, with no apparent myofiber damage, are a frequent incidental finding in equine muscle. Immune-mediated vasculitis resulting in muscle injury occurs in horses and is known as purpura hemorrhagica. Purpura hemorrhagica has been classically associated with Streptococcus equi ssp. equi, but other bacteria, such as Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, can also cause purpura hemorrhagica.",

Depending on the nature of the nervous system defect, muscular lesions can reflect failure of innervation, denervation of previously innervated fibers, or a combination of both. The most common example of this is arthrogryposis in cattle and sheep in which in utero infection or toxin ingestion causes nervous system lesions that lead to failure of innervation or to denervation of skeletal muscle. In addition, a disorder thought to have a genetic basis has been reported in black Angus cattle and results in failure of innervation of skeletal muscle. Failure of innervation or Endocrine myopathies can also be complicated by the fact that endocrinopathy can also cause pathologic changes in peripheral nerves, leading to a mixture of myopathic (type 2 fiber atrophy) and neuropathic changes (denervation atrophy and alteration in fibertype pattern) within muscle. Denervation followed by reinnervation leading to fiber-type grouping can be seen in dogs with chronic hypercortisolism (see Fig. 15-18 , B) and hypothyroidism.

Many of the peripheral nerve disorders of animals are discussed in Chapter 14. Characteristic features of denervation atrophy are described in the section on Dysfunction/Responses to Injury, Alterations in Myofiber Size, Atrophy. Neuromuscular Junction Disorders. The neuromuscular junction is a modification of the postsynaptic myofiber membrane. At the neuromuscular junction, the membrane is folded to increase surface area and is studded with specialized ion channels known as acetylcholine receptors. After arrival of an action potential at the distal end of a motor nerve, the terminal axons release acetylcholine, which diffuses across the synaptic space to bind to the acetylcholine receptors. Binding opens these channels, leading to sodium influx, which initiates the skeletal muscle action potential that culminates in muscle contraction. Acetylcholine is rapidly degraded by acetylcholinesterase released from the postsynaptic membrane, which prevents continued stimulation and thus contraction of the muscle fiber.",

Inherited disorders of muscle metabolism (see E-Box 15-1) are characterized by reduced muscle cell energy production. Clinical signs include exercise intolerance, exercise-induced muscle cramps, and rhabdomyolysis (acute segmental myofiber necrosis). Metabolic defects can involve glycogen metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, or mitochondrial function. Metabolic disorders often cause increased blood lactate after exercise. Inheritance patterns vary. Glycolytic, glycogenolytic, and nonmitochondrial DNA-encoded enzyme defects are generally inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Defects involving mitochondrial DNA-encoded enzymes are inherited through the dam because all mitochondria are contributed by the oocyte.",

Acquired myasthenia gravis is an immune-mediated disorder caused by circulating autoantibodies against skeletal muscle acetylcholine receptors (Fig. 15-28) . Binding of these antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor on the postsynaptic membrane leads to a severe decrease in the number of functional receptors. The mechanisms by which antibodies damage these receptors are (1) direct damage to the neuromuscular junction, which may be visible with electron microscopy as simplification of the folding of the membrane, and (2) formation of cross-linked antibodies leading to receptor internalization. Sufficient functional acetylcholine receptors are present to initially allow normal neuromuscular transmission, but if there is sustained muscular activity the decrease in the number of available receptors leads to progressive weakness and collapse. Therefore acquired myasthenia gravis results in episodic collapse, and repetitive nerve stimulation causes a characteristic rapid decrease in amplitude of the muscle compound motor action potential. Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis can also be made after intravenous injection of cholinesterase inhibitors such as edrophonium chloride (Tensilon, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) in collapsed animals. The reduction in cholinesterase activity leads to more active acetylcholine being available within the synapse and rapid, although transient, restoration of skeletal muscle contraction.

Clostridium septicum is the most common cause of clostridial myositis in horses, but Clostridium perfringens types A to E, Clostridium chauvoei, Clostridium novyi, and Clostridium fallax can also cause infection. Infection can involve more than one clostridial species. Clostridium spp. are ubiquitous organisms that form spores within the soil and within the gastrointestinal tract. Unlike cattle, in which nonpenetrating trauma can cause muscle bruising and anaerobic conditions that activate clostridial spores already in the muscle, clostridial myositis in horses is virtually always secondary to a penetrating wound. Most often, this is an injection site of a nonantibiotic substance, but infection of sites of puncture wounds and of perivascular leakage of irritants in intravenously administered compounds are also possible. It is also possible that clostridial bacteria entering the blood from an injured gastrointestinal tract can colonize damaged muscle. This is one possible explanation for the frequent occurrence of signs of colic before development of clostridial myositis at the site of intramuscular injection of medications such as flunixin meglumine that cause localized muscle damage. Under anaerobic conditions, clostridia proliferate and produce toxins that damage blood vessels, resulting in hemorrhage and edema, and cause necrosis of adjacent muscle fibers.",

Clinically recognizable muscle atrophy is often most evident in paraspinal and gluteal muscles. Some cases have microscopic evidence of concurrent EPSSM (see the section on Inherited or Congenital Myopathies), which may be a predisposing factor. In others, nonsuppurative perivascular and interstitial inflammation has been detected, and the proposed mechanism is immune-mediated damage caused by crossreaction of streptococcal antibodies with muscle proteins. Affected horses do not show typical signs of purpura hemorrhagica but often have very high serum concentrations of CK (often greater than 100,000 units per liter) and AST (often greater than 10,000 units per liter). Affected horses may respond to corticosteroid therapy. Evaluation of stomach contents or contaminated feed may reveal the presence of toxin. However, horses are exquisitely sensitive to botulinum toxin, and because only a small concentration of the toxin may be present in an affected horse, available tests may not detect such a low concentration of toxin. In most equine cases, the diagnosis is made based on the clinical history after elimination of other possible causes of profound muscular weakness.

Infections are most common in the pectoral musculature, but other locations are possible. Affected muscles are swollen and edematous and contain variably sized zones of localized suppurative inflammation. Fever is common. The causative agent is readily isolated from affected tissue and can be seen in aspirates from intramuscular abscesses.

This defect causes abnormal (delayed) inactivation of sodium channel activity, resulting in membrane instability and continuous muscle fiber electrical activity, which is reflected in EMG findings (see later discussion). The pathogenesis of clinical signs of HYPP is complex and not entirely understood, either in horses or in human beings with a similar disorder. Affected heterozygotes have a mosaic of abnormal and normal sodium channels, and resting muscle membrane potentials are typically lower than normal. This leads to an increased likelihood of electrical generation of a prolonged muscle action potential, resulting in transient myotonia. When abnormal sodium channels are activated, the response to the resulting abnormally increased intracellular sodium is release of potassium into the extracellular space and bloodstream, resulting in hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia is not, however, a consistent finding. Feeding of highpotassium feeds, such as alfalfa products or feeds with added molasses, can precipitate clinical signs of HYPP, possibly by activating abnormal sodium channels. Another potential consequence of prolonged activation of abnormal sodium channels is inactivation of normal sodium channels, resulting in flaccid paralysis and collapse. This result would explain the typical signs seen during episodes, which include transient muscle spasm (myotonia), with protrusion of the third eyelid, followed by generalized flaccid paralysis. Decreased muscle temperature, as can occur as a result of a chilling rain, can precipitate episodic collapse in HYPP horses, possibly by decreasing the activity of the muscle sodium-potassium exchanger (the Na-K ATPase), an important means by which affected muscle compensates for abnormal sodium channel activity. Postanesthetic recumbency and anesthesia-associated hyperthermia have also been seen in HYPP horses. Affected horses can appear normal for many years, can have multiple episodes of collapse, or can die acutely. Serum concentrations of CK and AST are generally normal.

Abnormal accumulation of intracytoplasmic glycogen (confirmed by being PAS-positive, amylase-sensitive) within type 2 fibers is the histologic finding. In severe cases, aggregates of abnormal glycogen are eventually ubiquitinated, resulting in amylase-resistant inclusions composed of glycogen and filamentous protein. Certain breeds, such as quarter horse and draft-related breeds, seem to be most prone to the development of amylase-resistant inclusions, whereas glycogen aggregates are more common in other breeds.

Abnormal myofiber function caused by architectural alteration secondary to intramyofiber deposition of complex polysaccharide is also a possible mechanism, but the excellent response to therapy, even in horses with severe intramyofiber inclusions of accumulated polysaccharide, suggests that this is less significant than is altered energy metabolism. Recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis (see later discussion) is a commonly recognized sign, but unexplained pelvic limb lameness aborted, stillborn, or weak at birth or can have contracted tendons, rhabdomyolysis, or cardiac failure at an early age. The consequence of GBE deficiency is the accumulation of long unbranched chains of glucose within cells that leads to abnormal glycogen formation and intramyofiber deposits. These molecules would normally be converted into glycogen in the presence of GBE in the final step in the formation of glycogen. There are no specific gross pathologic findings. Pulmonary edema may be found in foals that die from cardiac failure. Characteristic histologic findings are round hyaline inclusions resembling amylopectin (polyglucosan bodies) within skeletal and cardiac myocytes, especially Purkinje fibers, and to a lesser degree within hepatocytes. Unlike glycogen, inclusions are PAS-positive and resistant to amylase digestion. As with other carbohydrate metabolic defects, a lack of energy production by affected fibers is thought to underlie cellular dysfunction. Disruption of cytoarchitecture caused by amylopectin deposition may also contribute.

Equine exertional rhabdomyolysis (tying up, azoturia, Monday morning disease, setfast, and blackwater) is characterized clinically by sudden onset of stiff gait, reluctance to move, swelling of affected muscle groups (especially gluteal), sweating, and other signs of pain and discomfort. Serum concentrations of CK and AST are often markedly increased. Signs may appear during or immediately after exercise, but only rarely is exertional rhabdomyolysis associated with exhaustive exercise. In severely affected horses, even minimal exercise, such as walking out of a stall, can cause clinical signs. High grain feeding and lack of regular exercise have been recognized to be factors leading to exercise-induced muscle injury for many years. Previous theories regarding the pathogenesis of equine exertional rhabdomyolysis include development of muscle lactic acidosis, vitamin E and/or selenium deficiency, hypothyroidism, and systemic electrolyte abnormalities. Only recently have studies concluded that lactic acidosis is not a finding in horses with exertional rhabdomyolysis, that hypothyroid horses show no signs of degenerative myopathy, and that electrolyte abnormalities as a primary cause of equine exertional rhabdomyolysis are rare. It is still thought that vitamin E or selenium deficiency can exacerbate signs of exertional rhabdomyolysis in predisposed horses, but neither vitamin E nor selenium deficiency is considered a primary cause. Recent studies have found that affected horses typically have an underlying myopathy, most often equine polysaccharide storage myopathy (EPSSM). There is evidence that recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis in thoroughbreds is the result of abnormal calcium homeostasis within skeletal muscle, although some affected thoroughbreds have been found to have EPSSM. Because muscle necrosis per se is not painful and does not cause muscle swelling, it is suspected that other factors play a role in this disorder in the horse. These factors include oxidative injury to muscle membranes occurring secondary to segmental necrosis and the subsequent production of oxygen-derived free radical compounds and vascular compromise resulting in ischemia (i.e., compartment syndrome when muscle damage occurs in a muscle with a as possible in a pasture or paddock are also important.

It can also occur in dairy cattle, especially those housed in free-stall barns where jostling and muscle bruising are possible. Clostridium chauvoei is a spore-forming, Gram-positive anaerobic bacillus. Its spores are ubiquitous in the soil and manure, and after ingestion they are on the position of the horse during anesthesia. In dorsal recumbency, the gluteal and the longissimus muscles are ischemic; in lateral recumbency, the triceps brachii, pectoralis, deltoideus, and brachiocephalicus muscles of the leg under the body become ischemic. The basic mechanism is that the pressure in the muscle exceeds the perfusion pressure in the capillaries. The use of adequate padding under the recumbent horse and the maintenance of normal blood pressure during anesthesia have greatly reduced the incidence of postanesthetic myopathy from muscle ischemia in horses. These days, underlying myopathy, particularly equine polysaccharide storage myopathy (EPSSM), appears to be the most common cause of postanesthetic myopathy in horses.",

When abscesses are present, the gross appearance is of an encapsulated mass filled with thick, yellowgreen, foul-smelling pus. In cases of cellulitis, pus dissects along fascial planes outside the muscle and between perimysial sheaths within muscles.

Myotonia in the goat is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, and the variable clinical severity is attributable to increased severity in homozygotes compared with heterozygotes.

Starting at approximately 2 weeks of age, affected goats develop severe muscle spasms in response to sudden voluntary effort, for example, when startled by the blowing of a locomotive's horn. Episodes of myotonia can last from 5 to 20 seconds and are characterized by generalized stiffness and adoption of a \"sawhorse\" stance. Goats often fall over. Sustained dimpling of muscle occurs after percussion. Serum concentrations of CK and AST are normal. Concentric needle EMG reveals the characteristic waxing and waning (\"dive bomber\") spontaneous activity of myotonia. There are no gross pathologic findings.

This canine disorder is homologous to Duchenne's muscular dystrophy of human beings and involves defects in the dystrophin gene, which codes for a membraneassociated cytoskeletal protein present in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The absence of dystrophin renders skeletal muscle fibers susceptible to repeated bouts of necrosis and regeneration. Necrosis of cardiac myocytes also occurs and is followed by replacement with connective tissue, resulting in a progressive cardiomyopathy. This ryanodine receptor is a calcium release channel located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum terminal cisternal membrane that links the T tubule to the sarcoplasmic reticulum during excitation-contraction coupling. Uncontrolled intracytoplasmic calcium release because of abnormal ryanodine receptor activity leads to excessive contraction with resultant heat production. Clinical disease occurs only in pigs homozygous for the defect, although human heterozygotes can also be susceptible to hyperthermic episodes after halothane anesthesia. It is suspected that this defect originated more than 50 years ago in a foundation animal and resulted in offspring with increased muscling and reduced body fat. Affected pigs are clinically normal until an episode of hyperthermia is triggered by a precipitating factor such as halothane anesthesia or stress. Episodes consist of severe muscle rigidity and dramatically increased body temperature. Severe cases progress rapidly to death.

Because they are multinucleate, skeletal myofibers are able to eventually upregulate and translocate dystrophin to restore this protein to those segments where it is missing throughout the entire myofiber.

In acute, fulminating cases, the muscle sections are filled with inflammatory cells, predominantly lymphocytes ( Fig. 15-47, A) , although interstitial eosinophils and neutrophils can also be present. The degree of myofiber necrosis is variable. Necrotic fibers in early stages are surrounded by lymphocytes that can be seen to invade intact myofibers (see Fig. 15-27, B) . Similar to human polymyositis, CD8 + smooth-haired miniature dachshunds. Typical signs of acquired disease are episodic collapse in an adult dog, with normal gait and strength after rest. Clinical signs can, however, be variable. The canine esophagus contains a large percentage of skeletal muscle throughout the length of the tunica muscularis; therefore megaesophagus is common in dogs with myasthenia gravis and may be the only presenting sign. This differs from human beings, in which only the proximal one-third of the esophageal muscularis is completely skeletal muscle and the lower third is completely smooth muscle. In some cases, mild weakness persists between episodes. Clinical signs of congenital myasthenia gravis appear at an early age (6 to 8 weeks of age) and in most affected breeds are progressive and typically quite severe. Affected dachshunds, however, appear to recover by 6 months of age. Repetitive motor nerve stimulation reveals an initial sharp decremental response, followed by relatively uniform amplitude potentials. Serum concentrations of CK and AST are normal.",

In most cases, myasthenia gravis is an acquired disease, with circulating antibodies directed at the acetylcholine receptors of the neuromuscular junction. An inherited predisposition to development of acquired myasthenia gravis has been reported in Newfoundland dogs. In some cases, onset of myasthenia gravis occurs because of thymoma or, less commonly, thymic hyperplasia. Myasthenia gravis associated with hypothyroidism also occurs in dogs but is rare. Congenital myasthenia gravis is due to abnormal development of the neuromuscular junction and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait in Jack Russell terriers, smooth fox terriers, and springer spaniels. Congenital myasthenia gravis also occurs in changes. Concurrent segmental myonecrosis and myofiber regeneration (polyphasic necrosis) are characteristic. Chronic myopathic changes, found in older animals, include severe myofiber hypertrophy, myofiber atrophy, internal nuclei, and mild to moderate endomysial fibrosis. Myocardial lesions consist of multifocal necrosis and mineralization of cardiac myofibers and fibrosis, primarily in the left ventricular free wall, papillary muscles, and septum. Affected cats may have a relatively normal life span, although unexpected death during anesthesia or forced restraint is common. The exact cause of this is unclear.",
