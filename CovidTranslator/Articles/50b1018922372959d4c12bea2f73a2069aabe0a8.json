            "text": "A robust and reliable cell culture system for serum-derived HCV (HCVser) has not been established yet because of the presence of neutralizing antibody and tropism for infection. To overcome this obstacle, we employed a lipid-mediated protein intracellular delivery reagent (PIDR) that permits internalization of proteins into cells. Although entry of HCVcc was not enhanced by the treatment with PIDR, entry of HCVser into hepatoma cell lines (Huh7 and HepG2) and immortalized primary hepatocytes (Hc and HuS/E2) was significantly enhanced by the PIDR treatment. The entry of HCVser into Huh7 cells in the presence of PIDR was resistant to the neutralization by an anti-hCD81 antibody, suggesting that PIDR is capable of internalizing HCVser in a receptor-independent manner. Interestingly, the PIDR-mediated entry of HCVser and HCVcc was enhanced by the addition of sera from chronic hepatitis C patients but not from healthy donors. In addition, neutralization of HCVcc infection by anti-E2 antibody was canceled by the treatment with PIDR. In conclusion, the PIDR is a valuable tool to get over the obstacle of neutralizing antibodies to internalize HCV into cells and might be useful for the establishment of in vitro propagation HCVser.",

Although combined-therapy with peg-interferon (IFN) and ribavirin has achieved a sustained virological response in 50% of individuals infected with HCV genotype 1 [2] , a more effective therapeutic modality for HCV infection is needed [3] . To this end, further detailed analyses of HCV are needed in order to clarify not only the viral life cycle but also the pathogenesis. Although cell culture systems for HCV (HCVcc) have been established based on the JFH-1 strain isolated from a fulminant hepatitis C patient [4] , such systems were unable to establish chronic infection in chimpanzees [4] or to induce cell damage and inflammation in chimeric mice xenotransplanted with human hepatocytes [5] , and therefore establishment of a robust cell culture system capable of propagating serum-derived HCV (HCVser) from hepatitis C patients is required.",

            "text": "Although previous reports suggested a partial replication of HCVser in the primary hepatocytes (PHH) freshly isolated from human liver [6] , the level of viral RNA replication was low and reconfirmation of the viral propagation was not achieved due to the difficulty of providing a stable supply of the PHH. Recently, it was shown that a three-dimensional culture system of immortalized PHH was capable of propagating the HCVser from chronic hepatitis C patients [7, 8] . HCVser in the patients was slightly amplified in these culture systems, but the levels of viral RNA replication were far lower than those of HCVcc in Huh7derived adaptive cell lines. Part of the difficulty in establishing a cell culture system for HCVser might be attributable to: i) the existence of high titers of neutralizing antibodies in the sera of hepatitis C patients [9] ; ii) the heterogeneity of HCV particles (quasispecies), which exhibit different cell tropisms for infection and replication [10] ; and iii) the inconsistent expression of the putative receptors for HCV entry, including CD81, SR-BI, claudin-1 and occludin [11] . It may be necessary to overcome these obstacles before a robust and reliable in vitro cell culture system can be established for HCVser.",

Entry of HCVcc into not only the permissive cell line Huh7.5.1 but also the non-permissive cell line PLC/PRF/5 has been shown to be enhanced by spinoculation [15, 16] . In this study, we examined the effects of these accelerating procedures for entry of HCVser and found that a cationic amphiphilic-based lipid-mediated protein intracellular delivery reagent (PIDR) [17] exhibited a potent enhancement of entry of HCVser. Our data suggest that PIDR allows complex formation with viral particles via both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and enhances internalization of the HCVser into cells in a receptor-independent manner.",

Next, to determine the receptor-independent entry of viral particles into cells by the PIDR, the expression of GFP upon infection of a pseudotype VSV lacking VSVG (VSV\u0394Gpv/GFP) into Huh7OK1 cells was examined. Although VSV\u0394Gpv/GFP lost infectivity due to a lack of the G glycoprotein, the addition of PIDR facilitated entry of the particles (Fig. 1A) . To further examine the effect of the presence of neutralization antibody on the delivery of viral particles by PIDR, the expression of GFP upon transduction of VSVpv/GFP into Huh7OK1 cells in the presence of neutralization antibody and PIDR was examined. Although VSVpv/GFP exhibited a high infectivity to Huh7OK1 cells and the infection was completely neutralized by the anti-VSVG antibody, treatment with PIDR partially recovered the infectivity of VSVpv/GFP neutralized by the antibody (Fig. 1B) . Similar results were confirmed by using VSV\u0394Gpv/luc and VSVpv/luc carrying the luciferase gene as a reporter (Fig. 1C) .

Therefore, we examined the effect of PIDR on the entry of HCVser into immortalized human hepatocytes, including Hc and HuS/E2 cells. The addition of PIDR enhanced the entry of HCVser into both Hc and HuS/E2 cells ( Fig. 6A and B) . These results indicate that PIDR has the potential to enhance the entry of HCVser into not only cancer cell lines but also immortalized hepatocytes. Next, to evaluate the long-term effect of PIDR treatment on the infectivity of HCVser, Hc cells inoculated with CHS pre-incubated with PIDR were cultured for a long period. HCV-RNA could be detected at 10, 15 and 20 days after PIDR-mediated infection (Fig. 6C) . However, significant elevations of HCV-RNA titers were not seen (Data not shown).",

Especially, trypsinization and reseeding of cells dramatically reduced HCV-RNA levels in groups that were not treated with PIDR as compared to those were treated with PIDR ( Fig. 3B and C) , and PIDR treatment dramatically increased the internalization of HCVcc treated with CHS or AP-33 at 2 and 4 days after infection ( Fig. 2B and C) . These results suggest that PIDR is feasible to deliver HCV/CHS complexes into target cells that allow productive infection. In addition, PIDR facilitated the entry of HCVser into the hepatoma cell lines and immortalized human hepatocytes in an hCD81-independent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the intracellular delivery of HCVser by PIDR was enhanced by the addition of anti-HCV antibodies in sera from chronic hepatitis C patients, suggesting that PIDR is an effective reagent for the intracellular delivery of HCVser into the target cells in a receptor-independent manner.",

PIDR is a cationic amphiphilic-based protein delivery reagent that forms a complex with proteins through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions [17] . The complexes of protein molecules and PIDR have been shown to interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface, and then to be internalized through endocytosis, after which the protein molecules are released from the complexes into the cytoplasm [17] , suggesting that PIDR is capable of enhancing not only adsorption but also penetration of HCVser.",

Therefore, it is feasible to speculate that some host factors are involved in the entry of HCVser into hepatocytes in vivo. Recently, Stamataki et al. [26] suggested that peripheral blood B lymphocytes participate as a reservoir for HCV for persistent infection and as a vehicle for transinfection to hepatocytes.

In this study, the entry of HCVser by the treatment with PIDR was shown to be independent from hCD81. Although the involvement of receptor candidates other than hCD81 was not examined in this study, PIDR was shown to enhance the entry of HCVser in cell lines including Huh7, HepG2, HepCD81, Hc and HuS/E2, suggesting that PIDR is capable of enhancing the entry of HCV through a pathway independent from the expression of these receptor candidates.",

Furthermore, it was shown that the in vitro transcribed JFH-1 RNA used for the recovery of infectious particles contained 2.21 \u00c2 10 11 copies/mg [30] , which is much higher than the amount of viral RNA detected in the patient's sera. The variety of cell tropisms depending on the quasispecies of HCV particles, a low viral load in sera co-existing with neutralization antibodies, and the lack of identified co-factors including functional environment of the liver might be the major obstacles to establishing cell culture systems for the propagation of HCVser. Several approaches have been taken for the establishment of an in vitro cell culture system of HCV, including the culture of human liver cells in a three-dimensional radial-flow bioreactor [31] , the three-dimensional culture of immortalized primary hepatocytes [7] , and the micropatterned culture of primary hepatocytes [8] . These innovative approaches to the cell culture of liver cells, in combination with PIDR which is able to overcome the first barrier of HCV propagation might contribute to a breakthrough in the establishment of a robust cell culture system of HCVser.",
