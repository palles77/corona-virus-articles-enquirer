Until recently, transmissible gastroenteritis virus was the only virus known to be specifically associated with diarrhea in swine of all ages. In 1976, following the discovery of rotaviruses in different, animal species, a porcine rotavirus was detected in the feces of pigs with diarrhea (14) . Diarrhea could be reproduced experimentally in piglets with this virus. In a search for rotaviruses on Belgian swine breeding farms with diarrheal problems, a new coronavirus-like particle was detected b y electron microscopic examination of intestinal or fecal samples from sick pigs. The present report describes the morphology of this coronavirus-like particle, and shows that it is distinct from the known porcine coronaviruses and causes diarrhea.",

TGEV infections can also be diagnosed serologically. J:IEV was first described in Canada in 1962 as a cause of centrM nervous disorders in pigs (4). The same virus was later associated with a disease syndrome called vomiting and wasting disease in several European countries (1, 8) . The virus can easily be detected by cultivation in several porcine cell cultures (11). Both TGEV and HEV have been classified as coronaviruses mainly on the basis of their specific morphology (10).",

Death occurred up to the age of 7 days and the overalI mortality rate in these piglets was approximately 50 per cent (9) . It decreased with increasing age. TGEV was suspected as the cause of this diarrhea.

Grids were examined using a Zeiss EM 9 S-2 electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 60 KV. Micrographs used for particle size measurement were taken at an instrumental magnification of 28,000 X, which were then photographically-enlarged to 84,000 X or 168,000 \u00d7. gotavirus particles were not detected.

A bacteria free filtrate of the supernatant of a 20 per cent suspension of this material was used for inoculation of 12 colostrum-deprived-hysterectomy-derived piglets, kept i n isolation. Seven control pigs were used. The pigs were inoculated at the age of 3 to 15 days. All the inoculated pigs developed a watery diarrhea within 24 to 36 hours after inoculation whereas the control animals remained normal. Coronavirus-like particles were detected by electron microscopic examination in the watery feces or intestinal contents of each of the experimentally inoculated pigs.

They were pleomorphic with a range in diameter of 95 to 190 nm, including the projections, which were approximately 18 nm in length. Most particles were between t30 and t70 nm in diameter. The projections formed a single fringe radiating from the core. They appeared to be club-shaped. Only the dilated distal ends of the projections were seen on the micrographs. The negative stain also appeared to settle on the surface of some particles and an electron opaque central area covered by surface projections was often seen (Fig. 1 a --a r r o w s and lc) . No internal structure was observed. It was impossible to distinguish these coronavirus-like particles morphologically from TGEV or H E V particles from similar preparations. Other particles, different from these coronavirus-like particles, were also observed in the majority of the fecal samples. As seen in Figure 2 , they were pleomorphic and very variable in size, ranging in diameter from 95 to 650 nm with an average diameter of 190 to 225 rim. They carried numerous short projections, of approximate length 9 nm, on their surfaces. Similar particles of unkno~m identity have been described in human and animal fecal samples (3, 5, 6) . In the present studies such particles have also been found in the solid fecal samples of the control pigs. They appeared, therefore, not to be associated with diarrhea. Rotaviruses and other recognizable virus particles were not seen in control or experimentally inoculated pigs.",
