To determine the specificity of the proapoptotic effects of juglanin, Hs68 fibroblast cells were treated with juglanin and cell viability was analyzed. Notably, juglanin induced no significant cell death in Hs68 cells (fig. 6B ). in addition, the present study indicated that UVB exposure led to a significant downregula-tion in the viability of B16f10 cells (fig. 6c ). upon uVB irradiation at 10 mj/cm 2 , the viability of B16f10 cells was decreased by ~40% compared with in unirradiated control cells. However, 10 mj/cm 2 uVB induced no apparent cell death of normal Hs68 human fibroblast cells, and was therefore selected for further experiments (fig. 6d) . the present study investigated whether juglanin enhanced cell death of uVB-irradiated B16f10 cells. the results indicated that treatment of uVB-irradiated B16f10 cells with 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 \u00b5m juglanin increased the percentage of cell death ( fig. 6e) . these results indicated that the effectiveness of juglanin to induce cell death was, at least partly, contributed to specific cell type and may rely on the concentration of administration.",

Previous studies have indicated that plant-derived compounds possess potential antimutagenic, anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, and are gaining considerable attention regarding the prevention and inhibition of uVB-induced skin damage (32) . juglanin is a natural compound extracted from crude Polygonum aviculare, which exhibits inhibitory activity against inflammation and cancer growth (7) . in the present study, juglanin was topically applied to uVB-exposed SKH-1 hairless mice by gavage in order to explore its effects on inflammatory markers, and the p38/JNK and Pi3K/aKt-associated apoptosis signaling pathways (33) . in response to uVB irradiation, activation of p38 maPK and jnK is considered to induce apoptosis (34) . therefore, the inactivation of p38 and JNK is likely to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of juglanin in uVB-irradiated mice and cells. in our study, we found that in vivo p38 maPK and jnK maPK pathway was inactivated by juglanin in uVB-treated animals, while apoptosis was induced by juglanin. Herein, we supposed that there might be other signals involved in juglanin-regulated apoptosis in the skin of mice with uVB irradiation. furthermore, in vivo, uV reduced caspase activation and ParP cleavage, whereas in vitro, it increased them. as for this, we hypothesized that there were different types of cells in tissue composition, while in vitro, only skin cancer cells were included (35) . consequently, different results were observed. thus, further study is still required in future to comprehensively reveal the underlying molecular mechanism by which juglanin modulates apoptotic response in multiple types of cells.",

The inflammatory response promotes skin cancer progression. in addition, tnf-\u03b1, il-1\u03b2 and il-18 serve a critical role in induction of uVB-induced skin hyperplasia and inflammation (37) . In the present study, the expression levels of tnf-\u03b1, il-1\u03b2 and il-18 were increased following uVB exposure, whereas juglanin treatment significantly inhibited TNF-\u03b1, il-1\u03b2 and il-18 expression in the skin of uVB-exposed mice. increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines further promotes infiltration of inflammatory cells (38) . In addition, the nf-\u03baB signaling pathway is associated with the transcription of numerous proinflammatory genes, including IL-1\u03b2, il-18 and tnf-\u03b1 (39) . it has previously been suggested that uVB radiation enhances nf-\u03baB signaling in mouse skin (40) . Pi3K/aKt has been suggested to have an important role in modulating the inflammatory resp onse via regulation of NF-\u03baB (41) . a previous study reported that the Pi3K/aKt-regulated nf-\u03baB pathway was involved in myocardial injury following chronic stress (42) . in addition, uVB radiation has been reported to stimulate numerous signal transduction pathways, including the Pi3K/aKt pathway in vivo and in vitro (43) . Given the possible causal relationship of inflammation with cancer, the present study hypothesized that the Pi3K/aKt-regulated nf-\u03baB pathway may be involved in uVB-induced skin cancer. the in vivo results of the present study indicated that the nf-\u03baB signaling pathway was activated, accompanied with increased Pi3K/aKt phosphorylation, in uVB-exposed mice. notably, juglanin was able to suppress inflammation via NF-\u03baB inactivation and aKt inhibition. dna injury caused by uVB radiation results in stabilization and accumulation of p53 protein via transcri ptional activation, which serves an essential role in cell cycle arrest. once activated, the p53 protein translocates to the nucleus and activates numerous dna-binding proteins and downstream effectors associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptotic induction (44). in uVB-exposed skin, p53 activation leads to p27 and p21 activation, which in turn suppresses cyclin d/cdK1 kinases in skin cancer. Blockage of the cell cycle helps to repair damaged dna via nucleotide excision repair mechanisms (45) . in the present study, western blotting clearly demonstrated that p53, p27 and p21 expr ession was decreased in the skin of uVB-exposed mice and cells. juglanin treatment further augmented protein expression of p53, p27 and p21 in uVB-exposed mice and cells in vivo and in vitro. Pcna enhances degradation of the replication initiation factor complex induced by dna damage; upregulated Pcna expression in uVB-induced dna-injured cells is a result of the combination of p53 and the Pcna promoter (46) . in the present study, treatment with juglanin significantly suppressed the protein expression levels of PCNA in the skin of uVB-exposed mice. in addition, cyclin d1 is an important proliferative marker, which regulates cell proliferation (47) . overexpression of cyclin d1 is associated with the development and progression of numerous types of cancer, including uVB-induced skin carcinogenesis (48) . in the present study, uVB exposure significantly upregulated cyclin d1 expression. However, juglanin treatment significantly inhibited the expression of cyclin d1 in the skin of uVB-exposed mice.",
