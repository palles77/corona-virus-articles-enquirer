No effective prophylaxis or treatment for SARS is available up to now. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). By expressing a U6 promoter-driven small interfering RNA containing sequences homologous to part of ACE2 mRNA, we successfully silenced ACE2 expression in Vero E6 cells. By detecting negative strand SARS-CoV RNA and measuring RNA copy numbers of SARS-CoV by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we demonstrated that SARS-CoV infection was reduced in the ACE2-silenced cell lines. These findings support the involvement of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infections and provide a basis for further studies on potential use of siRNA targeting ACE2 as a preventive or therapeutic strategy for SARS.",

In our experiments with an inoculation dose of 10 -1 to 10 -2 MOI, viral loads reached nearly normal levels 72 h post-inoculation (Fig. 4b,c) , suggesting as low as 4% of ACE2 expression (Fig. 1) is sufficient to support entry of SARS-CoV particles adequate to produce equivalent viral loads at 72 h.

Another concern about translating the current results to a clinically relevant context is that ACE2 was reported to be an essential regulator of cardiac function [33, 34] .

Replication of SARS-CoV was reduced in these ACE2-silenced cells. The hypothesis that eliminating ACE2 can reduce or block SARS-CoV infections was proved to be true. However, considering the modest effect observed and concerns raised above, applying siRNA technology for SARS prevention or therapy requires further efforts.",
