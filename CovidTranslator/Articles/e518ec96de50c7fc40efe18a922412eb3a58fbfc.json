            "text": "It has been previously demonstrated that the generation of measles virus (MV)-specific cytotoxicity (CTL) is reduced in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). By contrast, CTL specific for influenza virus (FLU) and mumps virus is normal. It is uncertain if reduced CTL is limited to MV in MS patients, or if reduced CTL may be found to other viruses as well. Since MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules, while FLU-specific and mumps-specific CTL have large HLA class I-restricted components, reduced MV-specific CTL may reflect a broader reduction in HLA class II-restricted CTL in patients with MS. To examine this question we studied the generation of CTL specific for herpes simplex virus type I (HSV). HSV-specific CTL, like MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules. We found that patients with MS had reduced generation of CTL to both MV and HSV. Most, but not all patients who had reduced generation of CTL to one virus also had a similar impairment with respect to the second virus. Some patients, however, had a reduction in the generation of CTL only to MV or to HSV. These findings extend our earlier observations regarding reduced MV-specific CTL in patients with MS to a second HLA class II-restricted virus, HSV. Such a reduction may reflect discrete impairments in immune function to separate viruses, possibly those that are associated with viral persistence, or may reflect a more generalized defect in HLA class II-restricted CTL.",

This appears to be the result of a decreased precursor frequency of MV-sensitized effectors rather than suppression of MV-specific CTL by immunoregulatory cells (McFarland et al., 1988) . By contrast, CTL responses to the related paramyxovirus mumps virus, and to another RNA based virus, influenza virus, is normal in MS patients (Jacobson et al., 1985; Goodman et al., 1989) , suggesting that the impaired virus-specific CTL seen in MS patients may be limited to MV. If MV-related immunity is uniquely affected in MS, such an observation may reflect abnormal infection with MV. A similar impairment in the generation of MV-specific CTL has been reported in patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a disorder known to be the result of a persistent infection with MV (Dhib-Jalbut et al., 1989) .",

In this investigation, we examined the HLA restriction pattern of the HSV-specific CTL assay by assaying HSV-sensitized effectors on allogeneic B-cell targets that were either matched at HLA class I loci, HLA class II loci, or were HLA mismatched. As shown in Fig. 2 , the HSV-sensitized effectors recognized HLA class II-matched targets, but failed to recognize either HSV-infected targets matched at HLA class I, HSV-infected HLA-mis- matched targets, or uninfected targets. By contrast, the class 1-matched and -mismatched targets were readily killed by their autologous effectots. Similar results in HLA restriction were obtained for CTL from MS patients as were found for controls. In a subsequent experiment examining the HLA restriction of HSV-specific CTL (see Fig.  3 ), none of the four HLA-mismatched targets, nor the four HLA class I-matched targets evidenced lysis above that seen for the uninfected autologous control. By contrast, both HLA class ll-matched targets as well as the autologous HSV-infected target (positive control) were readily lysed by HSV-sensitized effector. This indicates that HSV-CTL, like MV-CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules, and is supportive of observations by other investigators regarding the HLA class II restriction of HSV-specific CTL (Yasukawa and Zarling, 1984a, b) .",

Such CTL are thought to be primarily mediated by CD4 + T-cells. Reduced CD4 + T-cell-mediated CTL in MS is intriguing insofar as MS patients have been repeatedly shown to generate elevated amounts of antibody to multiple viruses (including both MV and HSV) (Norrby et al., 1974a, b; Baig et al., 1989) . The generation of such antibody is also dependent upon CD4 + T-cells (Van Binnendijk et al., 1989) . Similar elevations of antibody production with reduced CTL have been reported in a number of animal models of autoimmune disease, including murine graft-versus-host disease, and murine lupus (Gleichmann et al., 1984; Theofilopoulos et aI., 1985; Moser et al., 1987; Via et al., 1987 Via et al., , 1990 Via and Shearer, 1988) . In addition, reduced MV-specific CTL has been reported in patients with HAM/TSP, a demyelinating disorder caused by the HTLV-I virus that is similar to MS . Further, patients with early, asymptomatic infection with HIV-I, the virus responsible for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), also have elevated anti-body production and reduced CTL (Shearer et al., 1986; Eales et al., 1988) . This is intriguing insofar as it is during early HIV-I infection that AIDS patients arc most susceptible to autoimmune disorders such as inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Thus, it is possible that reduced HLA class ll-restricted CTL may predispose patients to the development of autoimmune disease.",

It has been suggested that HLA class II-restricted CTL may play a role in regulating the immune response to virus by the lysis of antigenpresenting cells that display viral antigens (Ottenhoff and Muffs, 1990; Strober and James, 1990) . Such lysis would tend to limit the immune response, and may inhibit the generation of selfreactive clones. A primary immunoregulatory abnormality in MS, whether genetic or acquired, that results in reduced HLA class II-restricted CTL may permit an exaggerated immune response upon stimulation with common viruses.

However, the generation of HLA class ll-restricted CTL in CTL responses marked by both CD4 + and CD8 + effectors (as is the response to mumps virus) may difl'er from that generated in virusspecific CTL responses that are predominantly HLA class II restricted. CD8 + T-cells have been reported to provide help, and may increase the generation of CD4 + CTL in systems where both CD8 + and CD4 + CTL precursors are generated.

It is possible that low CTL, when found in our assay system, may reflect gross reduction in virus-specific CTL, and that the assay may not be adequate to identify more subtle differences. In addition, the overall level of virus-specific CTL generated during primary infection is thought to be affected by numerous factors such as general health and age at the time of infection.

HSV-specific CTL is shown both on the autologous HSV-infected target, HSV-infected targets matched at HLA class 1 molecules, HSV-infected targets matched at HLA class 11 molecules, and l-|SV-infected HLAmismatched targets. A horizontal line has been drawn at the top of the panel of HLA-mismatched targets. The HSV-infected autok)gous target is readily lysed by the HSV-sensitized effector, as are both HLA class II-matched targets. By conlrast, none of the HLA class 1-matched targets are lysed at levels greater than that found for the panel of HLA-mismatched targets. This suggests that HSV-sensitized CTL is prcdominantly restricted by HLA class 11 molecules. MV-specific and HSV-specific CTL are shown for both healthy controls and patients with MS. Percent lysis at an effector to target (E:T) ratio of 40:1 is shown for virus-sensitized effectors assayed on autologous virus-infected targets. Both HSV-specific, as well as MV-specific CTL are reduced in MS.",
