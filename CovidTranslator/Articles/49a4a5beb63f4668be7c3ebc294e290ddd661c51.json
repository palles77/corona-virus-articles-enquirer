            "text": "Background: More than 100 immunologically distinct serotypes of human rhinoviruses (HRV) have been discovered, making detection of surface exposed capsid antigens impractical. However, the non-structural protein 3C protease (3Cpro) is essential for viral replication and is relatively highly conserved among serotypes, making it a potential target for diagnostic testing. The thin film biosensor is an assay platform that can be formatted into a sensitive immunoassay for viral proteins in clinical specimens. The technology utilizes an optically coated silicon surface to convert specific molecular binding events into visual color changes by altering the reflective properties of light through molecular thin films. Objecti6e: To develop a rapid test for detection of HRV by developing broadly serotype reactive antibodies to 3Cpro and utilizing them in the thin film biosensor format. Study design: Polyclonal antibodies to 3Cpro were purified and incorporated into the thin film assay. The in vitro sensitivity, specificity and multiserotype cross-reactivity of the 3Cpro assay were tested. Nasal washes from naturally infected individuals were also tested to verify that 3Cpro was detectable in clinical specimens. Results: The 3Cpro assay is a 28-min, non-instrumented room temperature test with a visual limit of detection of 12 pM (picomolar) 3Cpro. In terms of viral titer, as few as 1000 TCID 50 equivalents of HRV2 were detectable. The assay detected 45/52 (87%) of the HRV serotypes tested but showed no cross-reactivity to common respiratory viruses or bacteria. The thin film assay detected 3Cpro in HRV-infected cell culture supernatants coincident with first appearance of cytopathic effect. Data are also presented demonstrating 3Cpro detection from clinical samples collected from HRV-infected individuals. The assay detected 3Cpro in expelled nasal secretions from a symptomatic individual on the first day of illness. In addition, 9/11 (82%) concentrated nasal wash specimens from HRV infected children were positive in the 3Cpro test. Conclusion: We have described a novel, sensitive thin film biosensor for rapid detection of HRV 3Cpro. This test may www.elsevier.com/locate/jcv Abbre6iations: HRV, human rhinovirus; 3Cpro, 3C protease; OIA, optical immunoassay; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; TMB, tetramethylbenzidine; MOI, multiplicity of infection; CPE, cytopathic effect. be suitable for the point of care setting, where rapid HRV diagnostic test results could contribute to clinical decisions regarding appropriate antibiotic or antiviral therapy.",

Significant progress has been made recently toward developing highly specific anti-rhinovirus compounds (Wang et al., 1998; Matthews et al., 1999; Patick et al., 1999; Schiff and Sherwood, 2000) and specific influenza treatments are currently available. Since the symptoms of many viral respiratory infections overlap but the therapies are virus specific, rapid diagnostic tests performed at the point of care setting may contribute to appropriate administration of these new drugs. In addition, identification of a viral infection may reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics. Currently approximately 50% of patients diagnosed with colds or upper respiratory tract infection receive antibiotics, even though this treatment is unlikely to change the course of disease (Gonzales et al., 1997) .",

The 3Cpro is responsible for the majority of cleavage events necessary for processing the viral polyprotein into the functional structural and enzymatic proteins required for viral replication. A significant degree of 3Cpro amino acid homology exists among diverse HRV serotypes, especially in the active site and RNA binding domain (Matthews et al., 1994; Walker et al., 1995; Meador et al., 1998; Palmenberg, 1998) . Although 3Cpro is required throughout all stages of viral replication, it is not packaged into the mature virion (Rueckert, 1996) . Therefore, the diagnostic clinical sample must contain infected cells or free 3Cpro originating from lysis of infected cells. The rapid test described in this study detects 3Cpro in expelled nasal secretions from HRV infected individuals and from virally infected cell culture lysates.",

Addition of a precipitating substrate for HRP transduces the molecular surface binding events to mass deposition on the surface, creating a thin film and producing a visible color change. The increase in thickness alters the reflective properties of the optical surface such that the predominant reflective wavelengths shift from yellow and red to purple and blue (Ostroff et al., 1999b) , indicating a positive result.",

Examination of available sequence data (Palmenberg, 1998) revealed that within the 3Cpep sequence, 10/14 amino acids were identical, and two of the remaining positions were conservative changes. Based on crystallographic data, the 3Cpep region of 3Cpro is on the opposite side of the molecule from the active site and is likely to be solvent exposed (Matthews et al., 1994) .",

Studies carried out by Turner demonstrated that rhinoviral infection of the nasal epithelium was focal and sporadic, with a higher concentration of infected cells in the posterior portion of the nasopharynx (Turner et al., 1984; Gwaltney, 1995) . Therefore, sampling of the nasopharynx with a small swab was expected to be an inefficient method for collection of infected material. Nasal washes are often collected in laboratory evaluations of respiratory infections, but this method of sample collection dilutes the specimen and is not practical in the physician office setting. Patient expelled secretions are a convenient collection method and sample material is released from infected cells throughout the length of the nasopharynx.",

We have shown that the 3Cpro assay detects 3Cpro in virally infected culture supernatants as early as 48 h after inoculation. The specificity of the test allows for HRV culture identification without additional confirmatory testing.",

This report is the first demonstration of 3Cpro as a marker for in vivo and in vitro HRV infection. We have provided evidence that although 3Cpro is not a structural viral protein, the concentration present in nasal secretions is sufficient for use of this protein as a diagnostic target. Rapid point of care viral assays may guide appropriate antiviral therapy in the near future. The 3Cpro assay described in this report is a first step in the direction of rapid identification of HRV in clinical specimens in a simple format suitable for the point of care setting. Further clinical validation is required to confirm these results and establish the utility of this assay in rapid early diagnosis of HRV infection.",
