Yet, it is the first time in history than mankind is facing a pandemic of this scale, with so many countries simultaneously and so strongly struck in such a short time. The pandemic is already claiming a heavy toll in terms of human lives, and will have considerable impact on the world economy. It might even represent a turning point for our ways of life. With now more than a billion people in isolation worldwide, and with an exponentially growing proportion of universities closing their gates, it is legitimate to ask ourselves what is our place as scholars and researchers in the field of cyberpsychology -and if and whether our work is actually needed at this moment.",

            "text": "Behavior (Guitton, 2013) pinpointed the importance of virtual spaces to help understand human behavior in existential risk situations. What was then a mainly theoretical stance is now a reality. While information is central in dealing with the pandemic, it can also generate high levels of anxiety among the population. Fake news are more actual than even, and mitigating their propagation is potentially as important to preserve social peace as fighting the virus itself. With social isolation getting more and more drastic, social media and the Internet can allow us to maintain the social bounds necessary for people to stay united. Distance teaching can compensate the closing down of schools and universities. Telework can reduce some of the impacts of the crisis on economy. While technology (notably with the democratization of travelling) might have been one of the factors that made COVID-19 reach a pandemic status, technology -and particularly online technologies -will also be a key element for us to survive this crisis. Therefore, for all these reasons, cyberpsychology research should not stop. As researchers specializing in how technology impacts human behavior, it is our duty to stay active, and to work to help document all these aspects. It is our duty to help propose and find solutions to the problems elicited by this sanitary crisis.",
