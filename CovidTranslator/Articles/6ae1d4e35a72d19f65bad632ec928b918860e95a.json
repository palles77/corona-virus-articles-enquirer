            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease in chickens caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The present study was carried out with the aim to develop anti-spike 1 (S1) subunit monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that could react with IBV strains of different genotypes. The high antigenicity region of S1 gene of an QX-like IBV strain Sczy3 was amplified and ligated into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a( + ), and the recombinant His-S1 fusion proteins were expressed and purified. The purified whole viral antigen of Sczy3 strain was used to immunize BALB/c mice to produce hybridoma-secreting anti-IBV MAbs. Eleven anti-IBV MAbs were generated, and two MAbs 1C8 and 2C10 were positive in indirect ELISA against both His-S1 protein and the purified whole viral antigen. These two MAbs showed positive reaction with IBV in Western blot, and the isotype were both IgM. These two MAbs react specifically with IBV but not with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H9 or H5, and could cross-react with other 10 IBV strains in five different genotypes. End-point neutralizing assay performed in chicken embro kidney (CEK) cells revealed that the neutralization titer of 1C8 and 2C10 against Sczy3 reached 1:2.82 and 1:4.70, respectively. The anti-S1 MAbs produced in the present work may be valuable in developing an antigen-capture ELISA test for antigen detection or a competitive ELISA test for antibody detection or therapeutic medicine for IB in poultry.",

            "text": "A vian infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious respiratory infectious disease hazardous to the poultry industry. It can infect chickens at all ages and replicates in many tissues, causing respiratory symptoms, diarrhea, decline of egg production and quality, etc. (1, 2) Prevention of IB is of economic importance to the poultry industry due to the high morbidity and production losses associated with the disease. (3) Although vaccines are now being used widely and extensively, outbreaks of IB still occur frequently, and epidemic IBV strains were mainly of QX-like strains. (4) It is well known that little or no cross protection occurs between different serotypes of IBV, and new serotypes may appear in the future, complicating the prevention and control of IB. (5) (6) (7) The etiologic agent of IB is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a prototype of the Coronaviridae family, which is an enveloped, positive sense, single stranded RNA virus. (8) The viral genome is around 27.6 Kb in length, and encodes four structural proteins, nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane glycoprotein (M), spike glycoprotein (S), and small envelope protein (E). (9) The S glycoprotein is post-translational cleaved at protease cleavage recognition motifs into the animal-terminal S1 and carboxyl-terminal S2 subunits by cellular protease. (10, 11) The S1 glycoprotein contains epitopes that induce virus-neutralizing, serotype-specific antibodies, hemagglutination inhibition antibodies, and cross-reactivity ELISA antibodies. (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) It also plays an important role in tissue tropism and the degree of virulence of the virus. (17) The development of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against coronavirus is critical for improvements in clinical diagnosis. (18, 19) Serological assays such as antigen capture enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (AcELISA) can be used for antigen detection of clinical samples. (18) Specific MAb against Taiwan IBV strain 2575/98 showed specificity to Taiwan IBV strains but had no cross-reactivity with the vaccine strain H120, and the MAb was used to establish a type-specific blocking ELISA to detect Taiwan IBV infection effectively. (19) Moreover, MAbs are used widely as powerful tools for identifying linear epitopes, or for mimicking the epitopes of infectious agents. (20, 21) For example, two MAbs against nucleocapsid protein of the IBV were used to identify two linear B cell epitopes of N protein by phage display peptide library screening and peptide scanning. (22) In addition, MAbs could be used as therapeutic material. (23) For example, a human-mouse chimeric antibody, engineered from MAbs against the receptor-binding domain on spike protein of SARS-CoV, displayed high affinity and good neutralizing activity. (24) Although S1 subunit is a relatively variable protein of IB with antigenic variations occurring more quickly than that of other structural proteins, such as membrane glycoprotein (M) or nucleocapsid protein (N), there are still relatively conserved regions or epitopes in the S1 subunit, and the S1 subunit anchored to the external surface of viral particles, making it the antigen more easily recognized by IBV-specific antibody than other IBV antigens. It is also important to use the antigen from prevalent strains of IBV for the development of MAbs for better sensitivity in subsequent MAb-based diagnostic methods. In the present work, development of MAbs against the S1 subunit derived from China isolate of a QXlike IBV strain Sczy3 was targeted for possible use in antigen or antibody detection against different genotypes of IBV. The MAbs against S1 would be useful in developing an antigencapture ELISA test for antigen detection or a competitive ELISA test for antibody detection for IB in poultry.",

(4, 7, 30, 31) Recombinant analysis of the Sczy3 genome demonstrated that Sczy3 is a chimeric strain derived from QX and H120. (32) Monoclonal antibodies are a powerful tool for virus detection and characterization. In recent years, a large number of MAbs have been developed for diagnosing diseases found in coronavirus. It is well known that it is very difficult to obtain the full-length S1 subunit from the purified IBV virions, and some expression systems are used to express it. (33) (34) (35) Most mouse MAbs raised from the IBV virions were mainly directed against the N protein of IBV; only a few MAbs were specific for the S1 subunit. (36) In the present report, a highly antigenic and hydrophilic region of the S1 protein pET-S1 was expressed and used to screen the hybridoma clones specific for S1 protein. Out of 11 hybridoma clones positive in whole viral antigen-based indirect ELISA, only two MAbs (1C8 and 2C10) were positive in recombinant S1 protein-based indirect ELISA, which also had a high intensity positive reaction with IBV in Western blot. The cross-reaction test showed that these two MAbs were both group-specific antibodies as they could react with five different genotype IBVs, indicating that these MAbs could be used for the establishment of diagnostic assays such as IFA and AC-ELISA against IBVs. Moreover, these MAbs had the ability to neutralize the infection of Sczy3 strain in primary CEK cells, demonstrating that these MAbs had potential for immunotherapy. In recent years, studies also focused on mapping the antigenic regions in S1 subunit, and these MAbs could also be used for identifying the neutralization linear epitopes of S1 protein and characterize the role of neutralization linear epitopes in the IBV infection in further studies.",
