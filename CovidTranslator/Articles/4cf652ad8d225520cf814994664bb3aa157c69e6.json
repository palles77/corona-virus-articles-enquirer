Much information has been gathered on digestive enzymes, development of the digestive system, and metabolism. Investigations have clarified further the role of colostrum in immunity and nutrition of the young calf. Several sources of nutrients have been tested for their suitability in formulation of acceptable milk replacers and calf starters. Once-a-day feeding of milk, colostrum, or milk replacer and early weaning are practical management procedures. Labor and cost efficient methods of feeding and caring for young calves have developed. Extensive work on rearing rates and methods of rearing was published during these 25 yr.",

Developments in housing have been phenomenal -from the calf hutch to environmentally controlled nurseries for calves. Heifer housing has ranged from relatively simple, but laborefficient housing, to complete confinement systems. Herd health programs have developed to minimize many disease problems that can be particularly disastrous in large herds. Contract rearing of herd replacements has become a more frequently chosen option in this period. Budgets for rearing calves from birth to freshening have appeared in recommendations for raising heifers.",

Upon the feeding of milk or a milk replacer, the esophageal groove closes, causing liquids to flow from the esophagus to the omasal-abomasal canal. Coagulation of milk in the abomasum occurs quickly after feeding. However, clotting does not occur with plant proteins or milk products dried at excessive temperatures. Gastric secretions are stimulated by feeding and together with saliva increase the volume of material to twice that fed. The pH of the abomasum is 1 to 2 before feeding, increasing to 6 after feeding, and then decreasing to prefeeding pH. The amount of acid secreted into the abomasum increases with age (5 5) .",

This group of salivary lipases, collectively known as pregastric esterase, is secreted from the region of the vallate papillae, the glosso-epiglottic area, and the pharyngeal end of the esophagus (47) . Although not isolated, at least six esterases have been detected electrophoretically. Evidence has accumulated to show that these enzymes preferentially hydrolyze short-chain fatty acids from triglycerides. Considerable lipolysis occurs with milk fat and coconut fat, buy activity is limited with lard, tallow, and vegetable oils. Secretion of salivary lipase is not affected by age or diet, although its significance appears to be with the milk-fed animal. Most of the lipolysis of milk fat by pregastric esterase occurs in the abomasum with little or no action by gastric lipase. Recent studies (17) show greater release of longchain fatty acids by pancreatic lipase when milk-fat is subjected to pregastric esterase before pancreatic lipase. Pancreatic lipase activity is low at birth and during the 1st wk of life (27) ; hence, some importance may be ascribed to pregastric esterase during this early period of life even though its exact physiological significance has not been elucidated fully.",

Rumination in calves is functional as early as 2 wk of age and in all calves by 6 to 8 wk if they are offered solid feed (14) . Studies of rumen microbes from calves inoculated with rumen contents and from isolated calves showed different bacterial populations, but some groups of typical tureen bacteria were in contents of isolated calves. If offered solid feed, rumen of calves will develop adult characteristics by 3 mo of age. Blood glucose decreases with age and reaches constancy by about 8 wk (27) . Reid (60) reviewed the status of colostrum to 1956. It had been established that the calf had little circulating antibody at birth and was dependent upon colostrum for passive immunity. The absorption period for immune globulins was during the first 24 h of life. Calves were not protected necessarily by colostrum from microbial challenges outside the dam's environment. The nutritional value of colostrum as well as its immunological properties was recognized.",

Previously milk replacers were really milk extenders and consisted of linseed oil meal, wheat middlings, wheat red dog, and oat flour. These were fed as gruels and were successful only if supplemented with milk (15) . During the late 1950's and early 1960's, milk replacers were formulated from dried skim milk, dried buttermilk, dried whey, and animal fat. Dried skim milk was the principal source of protein and carbohydrate because of its low cost. Fat was added directly to milk products and batchmixed -a process that permitted incorporation of fat to less than 10%. Consequently, energy content of milk replacers was not much higher than that of skim milk (66) . Methods for inclusion of fat were improved by homogenization of the mixture before spray drying, and proportions of fat in replacers were increased to 10% or more. As a result, high quality replacers were available, but high heat in drying of skim milk produced an inferior product (61) . Use of such replacers containing large amounts of heated skim milk often induced severe diarrhea. Lister and Emmons (34) showed severe diarrhea in calves fed milk replacers formulated with powders from skim milk heated for 30 min at 85\u00b0C. Much less diarrhea occurred when replacers were manufactured from skim milk preheated to 60\u00b0C or 74\u00b0C for 30 rain before spray drying.",

Some replacers containing protein other than milk were marketed, but growth of calves was restricted. Several studies on improving nonmilk proteins for replacers occurred during the 1960's and early 1970's. Meat solubles composed largely of collagen, soy flour, distillers dried solubles, brewers dried yeast, wheat flour, and fish protein concentrate generally have not supported performance when incorporated into replacers in large amounts. Soy protein concentrates and soy isolates have been used in milk replacers with good results and are in large amounts in present day formulations. Chemical treatment of soy flour has been studied extensively, and the product shows promise in milk replacers (58) . Soy protein concentrates are prepared by treating oil-extracted soybeans with water and alcohol to remove soluble carbohydrates and heating to inactivate inhibitors. The concentrate is 71% protein and has been a replacement for milk protein in several studies. Polzin (54) concluded that at least 50% of milk protein can be replaced by soy protein concentrates. Fish protein concentrates as the principal source of protein in milk replacers have not yielded good results, but recently Opstvedt et al. (49) successfully raised calves to 63 days of age on replacers containing fish protein concentrate. Digestibility of the milk replacer containing fish protein was lower than that of allmilk replacer, particularly during the first 3 wk. Performance of calves fed replacers of fish protein concentrate and dried whey was equal to calves fed an all-milk replacer. In the abomasum, the fish protein concentrate swelled and resembled the coagulation of casein.",

Studies on effects of time, and temperature fermentation, microbial composition of fermented colostrum, dilution rate, changes in composition during fermentation, amounts of colostrum to feed, acceptability, feeding value, and methods were conducted during this period. Chemical agents including organic acids, formaldehyde, and others have been tested as preserving agents. Those used most frequently are propionic, acetic, and formic acids. Some problems occur with acceptability at larger amounts of acid, but these can be alleviated with neutralization with sodium bicarbonate to pH 6. Recommendations developed from these studies were reviewed (19) .",

Mobile units with refrigerated storage of feed that automatically dispense feed at given intervals have been used where large numbers of calves are fed. Stationary automatic dispensers also have been used. Pelissier (52) reported that many large operators dispense milk by hose from mobile thermos tanks into individual pails rather than to use automated systems. Others have organized feeding with equipment for mixing and transporting liquid feed in nipple bottles or pails. Time for clean-up of equipment also has been reduced through organization and provision of good facilities. The offering of liquid diets at cold rather than warm temperatures was investigated. Cold milk or milk replacer fed in moderate environmental temperatures generally has supported gains equal to or superior to warm liquid. For veal calves fed ad libitum, warm liquid is preferred. There was some indication of increased diarrhea with cold milk feeding, but growth was not suppressed (3, 67) .",

More calving difficulties are encountered with undersized heifers than with those that are well-grown. Swanson (74) recommended 567 kg for precalving weight and 500 kg for postcalving weights of heifers from large breeds. Recommendation for age of heifers at first calving is approximately 24 mo. Suggested growth rates (46) are less than the maximum that could be expected and are based on the work of several investigations during this 25 yr. These allowances were developed to achieve goals mentioned previously. To calve at 24 mo at desired size, heifers of large breeds must gain approximately .7 kg/day (74) . Heifers with average daily gain less than this will require longer to attain desired calving weights. However, heifers fed to gain .8 kg per day could calve at 22 too. Heifers that are fed less than \"normal\" produce well and grow if fed liberally after calving.",

Swanson (73) proposed several schemes of feeding: 1) rapid growth during the 1st yr followed by roughage feeding; 2) uniform rate of gain at .68 kg/day throughout rearing; 3) slow growth of calves through use of low quality feeds followed by grain feeding during last 4 mo of gestation; 4) slow growth, delayed breeding for calving at 27 or 28 mo; 5) underfeeding with breeding at 20 to 21 mo; grain-feeding during last 3 or 4 mo.

As herd size increased, more dairymen began using separate facilities or attempted to extend use of existing facilities. Problems associated with inadequate housing emerged, particularly increased incidence of respiratory ailments and diarrhea. Research on and development of facilities consistent with good health, optimal growth, labor efficiency, and low construction or remodeling costs increased. Reports of research and field experience (6, 22) set forth criteria for satisfactory housing of dairy animals. Cleanliness, isolation of small calves from the milking herd, low humidity, freedom from drafts, dry beds, and provisions for ventilation and shade were vital for calves and heifers. Equipment for handling heifers during breeding and treatment was recommended. Individual pens or stalls were advocated for calves fed liquid diets. Group pens with limited numbers of animals of similar size and age were recommended for recently weaned calves. Older heifers could be kept in large groups so long as access to feed and water was satisfactory.",

Buildings have been cold uninsulated buildings with open eave and open ridge type of ventilation or warm, insulated, mechanically ventilated units. For calves fed liquid diets, individual stalls or pens often are recommended. The elevated stall of steel or wood construction has become commonplace. These stalls help to keep calves clean and dry. The separate pen or stall prevents nursing. The elevated stall with slotted flooring also eliminates the need for bedding. Housing for calves can be either a controlled or climatic environment. In cold climates the most successful buildings are those that remove moisture and stale air. Incidence of respiratory problems is greater in barns with insufficient ventilation than in those adequately ventilated (5) . At least four air exchanges are required per hour to remove aerosol contaminants and moisture. More exchanges are needed in warm weather. Temperature in calf barns is not as critical as humidity and air exchange. Calves tolerate temperatures to 5\u00b0C or lower with no discomfort (79) , provided adequate shelter, bedding, and feed are available. In very hot environments, higher mortality may occur. Under these conditions calves may have higher serum corticosteroid concentrations and lower IgG concentrations than controls (71) .",

Many experiment stations have developed plans for these individual calf units. Hutches have improved calf health and growth where problems, seemingly unsolvable by other means, existed. Although successful even in cold climates, caring for and feeding of calves in hutches may be uncomfortable for the calf caretaker. Jorgenson et al. (29) compared good indoor facilities with hutches and found no differences in growth, health, or weaning age of calves. Calves in hutches may be stressed during extreme cold, especially those less than 1 wk of age. More feed is consumed, and more labor is required by calves in hutches (40) as compared to calves in conventional housing.",

Irritants can be either infections, chemical, or physical. Infectious agents include both bacteria and viruses. The major bacteria associated with enteritis are E. coli and Salmonella. Roy (61) has stated that the basic knowledge on E. coli infections was established in the 1920's and is being reconfirmed every 20 to 25 yr. Knowledge on isolating and identifying viral agents and their interactions with enteropathogenic strains of E. eoli has broadened during the last 25 yr. Mebus (41) found the rota and corona viruses increased the severity of enteric infections when accompanied by bacteria.

            "text": "Respiratory disorders are a greater problem than enteric diseases in calves 6 to 8 wk of age. High population density with inadequate venti- lation usually are associated with higher incidences of the problem. Respiratory disorders are accentuated during periods of low relative humidities at high environmental temperatures and high relative humidity at low environmental temperatures (64) . California workers (36, 38) suggest calf mortalities increase during cold, wet, and windy weather in winter and to less extent with hot dry weather in summer. Speicher and Hepp (70) indicated higher mortality rates in winter than in summer. Calves housed within the stanchion barn were shown (24, 70) to have lower mortality rates than calves housed separately from the dairy herd. Perhaps one of the major advancements in health knowledge during the last 25 yr has been in the treatment of diarrhea in calves. While the effectiveness of broad spectrum antibiotics is unknown, replacement therapy of fluids with electrolytes has been valuable in preventing dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and subsequent death (56) . However, the best control method is adequate intake of colostral immunoglobulins by calves shortly after birth (61) . Enhancement of immune mechanisms through immunization programs should be in support of and not in place of colostral antibodies or good nutrition and managernefit. Vaccination programs (69) will vary according to geographical area, current knowledge of product immunogenicity, resistance developed by vaccinated animal, and risks of not vaccinating animals.",

These two methods of replacing milking cows still are used extensively, but contract rearing of replacements also has appeared as an option. This is especially true in the case of extremely large herds where labor and management focus is on the milking herd. Appleman (2) described two types of contracts: 1)the contractor raises the dairy heifers for a fee, but the dairy operator retains ownership of the heifers; 2) the heifers are purchased by the contractor and the dairy operator has an option to buy back the heifers before freshening.",

Appleman (2) estimated 912.5 h/yr are required for care of heifers in a 100 cow herd. Housing needs and costs vary considerably depending on climate. Sick calves require, on the average, 53 min extra care. Breeding fees, power, miscellaneous supplies, interest, insurance, and taxes will account for 6 to 10% of total expense in raising replacement heifers.",
