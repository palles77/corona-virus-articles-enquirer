Inmunidad antiviral. The uncontrolled progression of the aids epidemic has made the development of an efficacious human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine a major objective of scientific research. No effective preventive vaccine against HIV is currently available and sterilizing immunity has not yet been achieved in animal models. This review analyses the major challenges in developing an aids vaccine, in particular the mechanisms involved in viral escape from the immune response, and summarizes the results obtained with the different prototypes of therapeutic and preventive vaccines. Finally, social, economic and healthcare aspects of research into HIV vaccines and current controversies regarding the development of clinical trials are discussed.

            "text": "In the year 2003, the aids pandemic was responsible for more than three million deaths, and five million people are calculated to have contracted the virus during this period. This takes the number of infected people throughout the world to 42 million, with 20 million deaths registered since the origin of the pandemic was identified 1 . The geographical and economic differences in this disease are obvious, with more than 95% of cases and deaths by aids occurring in the third world (70% in Africa), especially among young adults, with a gradual increase in women. It is dramatic to see how, in sub-Saharian Africa, the epidemic continues to spread and, in many countries, the high percentage of people infected with aids has devastating effects on families and on the productive economy. The explosion of this epidemic in developing countries has raised the need to take urgent preventive measures and provide expanded access to antiretroviral therapy. However, in some parts of the world, these measures, although essential, are probably insufficient to curb the epidemic, so that the development of a vaccine is the only available possibility of controlling it. Therefore, the development of an efficacious HIV vaccine is not only an area of aids research which has yet to be resolved but also an urgent need for developing countries. This awareness has led to a considerable increase in financing the search for an aids vaccine. To obtain an effective HIV vaccine represents a major challenge and priority scientific objective for public and private institutions, governments and NGOs [2] [3] [4] (table 1) . This chapter analyses prototype vaccines being developed and the results obtained, the scientific difficulties in developing a vaccine, especially with regard to the mechanisms of viral escape from the immune response. Furthermore, as this research is set in the social, economic and healthcare context of the aids pandemic, current controversies surrounding clinical trials with the different types of vaccine 5 are addressed in this review.",

            "text": "The immune response begins with the recognition by CD4 lymphocytes via their receptor (TcR) of foreign antigens in the class-II HLA groove presented by cells specialized in antigen processing. Antigen recognition activates the different effector mechanisms of the immune system: cytokine and chemokine synthesis, production of antibodies by B lymphocytes, activation of CD4 lymphocytes and generation of cytotoxic CD8 lymphocytes. These last events represent the main mechanism involved in killing of virus-infected cells and to initiate this process cytotoxic lymphocytes must recognize the antigenic determinants of the virus lodged in the class-I HLA groove of infected cells 6 . As a consequence of the polymorphism of the HLA system both in antigen presenting cells and target cells different peptides (that are anchored in class II and class I HLA molecules respectively) are selected according to individual HLA haplotypes. In many viruses there are \"major immunodominant determinants\" (epitopes) which induce a potent response by the immune system. The efficacy of this response depends on two characteristics: first, they correspond to epitopes or domains of the viral proteins which are conserved among the different isolates, even in the context of highly variable viruses; second, these major determinants are capable of binding to the grooves of most HLA haplotypes. The existence and identification of these major immunogenic determinants is crucial when developing a vaccine, since they make up viral targets par excellence by being \"universal\" in two senses: as epitopes conserved in the viral protein among different isolates and as epitopes susceptible to antigenic presentation by most subjects regardless of their HLA haplotype. However, in the case of HIV, no similar dominant epitopes have been found to date, which represents a very important limitation when designing a vaccine. The presence of these major immunogenicity determinants in viruses with tremendous genetic variability, such as HIV-1, makes it practically impossible to define these epitopes empirically and experimentally. Nevertheless, bioinformatics can provide us with predictive methods which make identification easier 7 .",

For this objective to be reached, it is essential to know which immunological effectors are efficacious in the control of the infection in order to define a series of surrogate immunological parameters which enable us to evaluate whether a vaccine preparation is efficient or not. The intense immune response of HIV-infected patients is reported to encompass practically all the effector mechanisms of the immune system. This response is relatively wide, since it is developed against numerous epitopes, and practically all the viral proteins, both structural and regulatory, are recognized as foreign antigens. However, controversy still surrounds the role of \"protection\" played by each of these components of the antiviral response.

However, the production of antibodies with neutralizing capacity is scarce and viral escape from these antibodies is rapid 11 . Furthermore, in the immunization models developed to date, high levels of neutralizing antibodies are not consistently obtained and their presence is not systematically associated with protection. These data raise severe concerns about the role of the humoral response in the control of HIV infection 12, 13 . Nevertheless, almost all preventive vaccines induce neutralizing antibodies and their role as a surrogate protection marker is clearly demonstrated in other diseases. Therefore, \"a priori\", a preventive HIV vaccine should induce broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies 14 and this is one of the huge challenges currently facing the development of an aids vaccine. Recent studies which define the loca- tion of neutralization epitopes, antibody structure and mechanism of action 15 represent an important advance to define the characteristics that a given vaccine must have to induce neutralizing antibodies.",

Study of the cellular response has shown that in seropositive patients there is a clonal expansion of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes which are active against HIV. This expansion is particularly intense in patients with primary infection and correlates with the control of viral replication 17, 18 . There are also reports showing an intense CD4 and CD8 response in some patients during immune reconstitution after antiretroviral therapy, especially in those with a good immunological status before starting therapy 19, 20 . The same phenomenon has been described in patients with structured treatment interruptions who spontaneously control viral replication 21 . Although it is difficult to draw conclusions as to a cause-effect relationship between the appearance of a specific type of immune response and the control of viral replication, all the data seem to suggest that both helper and cytotoxic immune responses are essential to contain viral replication in the early stages of the disease, when the immune system is relatively undamaged. The most conclusive experimental data on the role of the cellular response in the control of viral replication come from studies in which selective depletion of CD8 lymphocytes in macaques infected with SIV leads to a huge increase in viremia and accelerated evolution to aids 22 .",

In consequence there is wide intersubtype and intrasubtype variability but the immunological relevance for vaccine design of this genetic disparity is a matter of debate. Several investigations have shown that genetic differences among HIV subtypes do not correlate with immunotypes. In fact, several genetic subtypes could share common protective epitopes and more than one immunotype can be found in the same genetic subtype. In general, neutralizing antibodies seem to be more strain-specific, whereas cellular immune responses have a broader spectrum. This lack of fidelity generates a high diversity in viral proteins which allows escape from the control of specific immune response. Therefore, HIV shares with other RNA viruses a common escape mechanism related to their high variability that allow the virus finding holes in the immune repertoire. Together with the variability generated by the high error rate of reverse transcriptase other mechanisms such as genetic recombination, which produces new subtypes and \"mosaic\" viruses among different subtypes, are also involved in the generation of HIV variants. Several molecular epidemiology studies have stressed the rapid dissemination of HIV variants and have described the distribution of several subtypes or recombinant viruses in different parts of the world. This could be an obstacle to the development of a universal vaccine 23 .",

            "text": "One central aspect of HIV infection which is not totally understood is the reason why viral replication is not controlled despite the potent immune responses elicited in primary infection. Although several explanations have been put forward, the most widely reported is viral escape through mutations in the viral epitopes recognized by the different effector mechanisms of the immune system 24 . Escape from CTL response is due to ad hoc mutations of the viral epitopes which interact with the groove of the HLA molecules. It has been shown that mutations in critical residues generate viral escape in both animal models and patients with primary infection and this event results in loss in the CTL response and parallel increase in viremia 25, 26 . However, in the chronic phase of infection, there is no clear correlation between the presence of specific CTL and the elimination or persistence of a given viral variant 27 . In addition to merely quantitative data, functional analysis have shown qualitative differences between CTL from progressors and non-progressors, such as the expression of perforins 28 , production of cytokines and chemokines, and reduced activity of the T-cell receptor against viral epitopes presented in the HLA complex 23 . These data suggest that qualitative aspects of CTL may be also important in the control of viral replication. A general strategy for maximizing the efficacy of a vaccine would be to obtain a cytotoxic response against a large number of epitopes from several proteins. However, recent studies suggest that a more targeted approach can be more effective. Thus, CTL against non-structural proteins (Tat, Nef) are more efficient in controlling infection but more prone to viral escape and do not last as long as CTL against the structural proteins Gag and Pol 29 . For a sterilizing vaccine, the objective would be to induce an intense CTL response against early proteins, whereas immunization against structural proteins would generate a response which would control viral replication thus attenuating infection. Another problem which may be a serious genetic resistance barrier is the adaptation of the virus to the HLA haplotype of the infected patient. In this situation peptides from viral mutants generated would reduce their affinity to HLA thus decreasing recognition by TcR and generating a greater resistance to CTL response 30 .",

Exposure of these conserved epitopes which are identified by neutralizing antibodies takes place at the moment of interaction between the viral and cellular membranes, a setting in which antibodies efficacy is lower given their low accessibility to neutralization epitopes. A second, more classic escape mechanism is epitopic mutation in the hypervariable regions found in the external domain of the viral envelope. Nevertheless, recent studies show that escape from these antibodies does not always require mutation in amino acid residues but takes place by glycosylation of the residues and formation of carbohydrate structures on viral gp120 known as \"glycan shields\" that represent authentic barriers to the action of neutralizing antibodies 32 . One of the most spectacular studies published during the last year shows how, during evolution in a specific patient, the viral envelopes gradually become resistant to all types of neutralization by neutralizing antibodies via accumulation of the previously mentioned escape mechanisms 32 .",

Furthermore, reactivation-reinfection processes take place in lymphoid organs, which provide an ideal cellular microenvironment for the process of infection: dendritic cells express in their membrane a lectin (DC-SIGN) which interacts with the virions and lymphocytes and enhances HIV infection 36 . Antigenic recognition by lymphocytes and the presence of cytokines in this microenvironment in turn increase infection of target cells and promote viral replication. As confirmation of these data, HIV-specific lymphocyte clones have been shown to be infected at higher proportion, which implies a preferential immunosuppression of the HIV-specific responses 37 . It must be stressed that the continuous generation of new, latently infected cells from the active viral replication compartment generates a \"continuous archive\" of changes produced in the virus throughout the disease, by including treatment-resistant mutated genomes and variants of the immune escape. The latent compartment is therefore not static and in some way HIV stores its \"history\" in latently infected cells 32 thus contributing to viral diversity as a mechanism of escape from antiretroviral therapy and vaccines.",

In the case of lentiviruses, one of the most spectacular findings was that which showed that a defective Nef-deleted SIV virus induced a protective response against the challenge with highly pathogenic aggressive viable viruses 38 . These experimental data had a natural correlate in the \"Sydney Cohort\", made up of 14 patients infected through blood transfusion from a seropositive donor and who, after 12 years of infection, had an excellent clinical and immunological status. The cloning and characterization of the virus in these patients and the donor showed that it presented deletions in the Nef gene and in critical regulatory sequences of the LTR region 39 . These findings led to the proposal of attenuated HIV vaccines similar to defective SIV mutants. However, it must be stressed that attenuated vaccines are usually used against viruses which do not persist or, alternatively, the attenuated virus used as vaccine is not capable of persisting in the host. This is not the case for Nef-defective viruses which not only infect, but also replicate and persist in the host, with the risk of drifting towards more aggressive variants in the vaccinated subject. The first alarming data came from vaccination of newborn maca ques in which, in contrast with was found in adults, the innocuous virus rapidly induced aggressive infection and death by immunodeficiency 40 . Furthermore, prolonged follow-up of patients from the Sydney cohort enabled us to observe an immunological deterioration and blips of viremia in some subjects 41 . Similarly, some adult maca ques vaccinated with the defective SIV virus developed aids from the virus they had been vaccinated with, which suffered reversions of the mutant phenotype 42 . Therefore, the use of vaccines from defective viruses has been ruled out, and this approach has been explicitly excluded in guidelines and recommendations of regulatory agencies.",

The main limitation of DNA vectors is that the intensity of the immune response induced is low, therefore they are generally used in combination with viral vectors. A disadvantage of this type of vaccine is the potential long-term secondary effects owing to chromosomal integration processes.",

In the case of SIV and HIV infection, we know that, after the first inoculum, infection takes place in a short period of time and an important reservoir of cells from the lymphoid system become infected. In some of these initially infected cells, the virus replicates actively, but in others it remains in a state of latency as an integrated provirus in the genome of the host cell.

The journal \"Science\" has been the forum for a series of letters from prestigious scientists criticizing investment strategy in the development of an aids vaccine and the initiation of phase III clinical trials 58, 59 . The strict scientific position defends that there are no consistent data on the efficacy of current vaccine prototypes to carry out phase III clinical trials. Consequently, such investment should be concentrated in basic research in order to get a better understanding on the mechanisms of protective immune responses and to develop new relevant animal models. Faced with this stance, a more humanist position bases the start of phase III trials on the catastrophic situation in developing countries and on the counterargument that, if there are no adequate animal models, it will be anyway necessary to carry out all the phases of the studies, including phase III, in humans to obtain a definitive response. Despite the reticence and pessimism of a large part of the scientific community, the general impression is that phase III trials will be carried out. It is important to remember the cost and effort involved in these trials, which require the follow-up of 10,000 patients for at least five years to obtain conclusive results. Therefore, with regard to aids vaccines, we are living in difficult times in which a huge economic investment will be necessary so that the scientific community can generate, develop and evaluate all the vaccine prototypes imaginable in animal models in order to find the Holy Grail of vaccines. As a reference, in case the European Union decided to start a program of phase I and II clinical trials with a reduced number of vaccine prototypes already generated in European laboratories an investment of 1.2 billions euros in the following 10 years should be required. With this objective in mind, the development of vaccine research centers has been proposed 68 . These centers would combine: (i) a critical mass of investigators, (ii) their sole dedication to the development of prototype HIV vaccines, (iii) a long-term commitment by academic, governmental and private institutions, (iv) sufficient resources and (v) continuous exchange of information and collaboration with the private sector. As a consequence of this policy the main leader organizations (NIH, IAVI, ANRS, EU, Gates Foundation...) should finance vaccine development centers and would coordinate their work. The prototypes considered interesting would be prepared under the conditions of Good Manufacturing Practice for use in humans and would enter a previously defined process of pre-clinical studies and phase I, II and III clinical trials. All the prototypes would meet the minimum requirements for clinical application, which would mean not only defining these criteria but also involving the regulatory authorities (FDA, EMEA) in their development. The evaluation of prototypes also requires the definition of those immunological markers which must be used to evaluate their potential efficacy. This in turn would mean developing standardized and reproducible trials to evaluate the humoral and cellular responses to HIV and the approval of laboratories which would carry out these immunological determinations. Lastly, the necessary healthcare structures should be set up to carry out the trials in clinical phases in developing countries, and the ethical criteria to be fulfilled in these trials should be defined. Given the large number of current prototypes (table 2), the application of homogeneous evaluation criteria is the only way to reach consistent conclusions which can be extrapolated to all situations.",

Only scientific effort combined with unprecedented solidarity will allow us to decide whether it is possible to find a vaccine against HIV and whether its application will be sufficient to curb the current aids pandemic.",
