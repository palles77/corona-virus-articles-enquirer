Here, we analyze the aerosol and surface stability of HCoV-19 and compare it with SARS-24 CoV-1, the most closely related human coronavirus. 2 We evaluated the stability of HCoV-19 and SARS- HCoV-19 remained viable in aerosols throughout the duration of our experiment (3 hours) with a 30 reduction in infectious titer from 10 3.5 to 10 2.7 TCID 50 /L, similar to the reduction observed for SARS-CoV-31 1, from 10 4.3 to 10 3.5 TCID 50 /mL ( Figure 1A ).",

SARS-CoV-35 1 had similar stability kinetics (polypropylene from 10 3.4 to 10 0.7 TCID 50 /mL after 72 hours, stainless steel 36 from 10 3.6 to 10 0.6 TCID 50 /mL after 48 hours).

This indicates that differences in the epidemiology of these viruses likely 52 arise from other factors, including high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and the potential for 53 individuals infected with HCoV-19 to shed and transmit the virus while asymptomatic 3,4 . Our results 54 indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of HCoV-19 are plausible, as the virus can remain viable 55 and infectious in aerosols for multiple hours and on surfaces up to days. This echoes the experience with 56 SARS-CoV-1, where these modes of transmission were associated with nosocomial spread and 57 superspreading events 5 , and provides guidance for pandemic mitigation measures. 58 Viability of SARS-CoV-1 and HCoV-19 in aerosols and on different surfaces. A) SARS-CoV 72 and HCoV-19 were aerosolized in a rotating drum maintained at 21-23\u00b0C and 65% RH over three hours. 73 Viable virus titer is shown in TCID 50 /L air. For surfaces, viruses were applied on copper, cardboard, steel 74 and plastic maintained at 21-23\u00b0C and 40% RH over seven days. Viable virus titer is shown in 75 TCID 50 /mL collection medium. All samples were quantified by end-point titration on Vero E6 cells. Plots 76 show the mean and standard error across three replicates.
