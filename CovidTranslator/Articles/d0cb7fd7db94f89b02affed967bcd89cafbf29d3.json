At admission she had shortness of breath and refused to drink. The patient's temperature was 39 \u00b0C, the respiratory rate was 50 breaths/min with oxygen saturation of 96% and her pulse was 177 beats/min. Upon auscultation bilateral prolonged expirium and end-expiratory wheezing was found. A chest radiograph showed the typical features of bronchiolitis. The child was treated with salbutamol and ipratropium at the first day, followed by the use of salbutamol only for 5 days.",

In addition, PCR tests for rhinoviruses, enterovirus, meta-pneumovirus and HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E were performed 1,2 . The original nasopharyngeal aspirate was inoculated onto a variety of cells. The cultures were kept in a rollerdrum at 34\u00b0C and inspected by eye every 3 to 4 days. Maintenance medium was replenished every 3 to 4 days.",
