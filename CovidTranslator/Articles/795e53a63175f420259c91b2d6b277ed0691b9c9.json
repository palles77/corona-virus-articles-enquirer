A rapid and sensitive ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed to simultaneously determine the five phenolic acids in rat plasma. After mixing with the internal standard (IS) tinidazole, plasma samples were pretreated by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate/n-hexane (9:1, v/v). The separation was performed on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (100 mm \u00d7 2.1 mm, 1.7 m) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min \u22121 , and acetonitrile/methanol (4:1, v/v)-0.4% formic acid was used as mobile phase. The detection was performed on a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) via electrospray ionization (ESI) source with positive ionization mode. All calibration curves had good linearity (r > 0.991) over the concentration ranges of 0.74-378 ng ml \u22121 for neochlorogenic acid, 0.50-1030 ng ml \u22121 for chlorogenic acid, 1.9-250 ng ml \u22121 for cryptochlorogenic acid, 0.74-380 ng ml \u22121 for 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, and 5.1-328 ng ml \u22121 for 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid. The intra-and inter-day precision were within 15% and the accuracy ranged from 86.2% to 114.1%.",

            "text": "It was reported that, more than 500 prescriptions containing Flos Lonicerae have been used to treat various diseases in China [3] , and its preparations, such as Jin-Yin-Huang oral liquid composed of Flos Lonicerae alone, Shuang-Huang-Lian tablet, Yin-Qiao-Jie-Du tablet, Fufang Jin-Huang-Lian Granule, Qing-Re-Jie-Du oral liquid and Fufang Qin-Lan oral liquid, etc. [4] , in which Flos Lonicerae was the main and active composition, were extensively used for treating acute upper respiratory tract infection caused by virus or bacterial infection in clinical practice. It was found that those phenolic acids especially isochlorogenic acids in Flos Lonicerae were the main bioactive components for antioxidant, antiviral and antibacterial effects by \"Spectrum-activity relationship\" and \"Knock-out/Knock-in\" methods [5, 6] . Besides, we also found that the oral bioavailability of chlorogenic acid in Flos Lonicerae, the indicator compound recorded in Chinese Pharmacopeia [7] , was enhanced largely as the Chito-oligosaccharide at the dosage of 25 mg/kg, one of the most important absorption enhancers possessing a loosening effect on the tension of the tight junctions through ionic interactions with negatively charged groups of glycocalix [8] , was added, and its antiviral activity in vitro was improved significantly [4] . Thus, phenolic acids might be one of the most important compositions to characterize the quality of Flos Lonicerae. In order to elucidate the action mechanism of phenolic acids in vivo, it is essential to develop a quantitative method for determining these phenolic acids in plasma samples and studying their pharmacokinetic profiles.",

However, apart from chlorogenic acid, simultaneous pharmacokinetic studies of other phenolic acids have not been reported after oral administration of Flos Lonicerae preparations in rats, and very little attention has been devoted to the pharmacokinetic studies of these components. In the previous pharmacokinetic studies of chlorogenic acid, its concentration in plasma was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV, ECD or MS [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, Flos Lonicerae contains a series of phenolic acids that have isomer properties with different pharmacological activities [18] shown in Fig. 1 . Therefore, it was desirable to develop an analytical method to allow the five analytes to be quantified simultaneously in rat plasma.",

It was found that protein precipitation using methanol or acetonitrile gave an effective absolute extraction recovery of analytes whilst they appeared poor repeatability and non-negligible matrix effects from endogenous plasma components on the ionization of the analytes and the IS (data not shown). Besides, it was shown from liquid-liquid extraction using ethyl acetate that the extraction was consistent, compared with protein precipitation, but showed also serious matrix effects. As a result, a mixture of ethyl acetate/n-hexane (9:1, v/v) was utilized to extract the five analytes and the IS, resulting in consistent and precise extraction efficiency (Table 3) . Besides, the matrix effects from endogenous plasma components on the ionization of the analytes and the IS were negligible. Therefore, it was demonstrated that ethyl acetate/n-hexane (9:1, v/v) produced the best extraction solvent for all the analytes and IS.",
