One of his longstanding ideas has been to develop a global network of regional institutions built on the model of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To address routine and emerging disease challenges, this network would blend state-of-the-art molecular approaches such as evolutionary genetics, proteomics, sequencing, and subtyping with traditional fi eld investigations and surveillance.",

The dictionary defi nes an encyclopedia as \"a work that contains information on all branches of knowledge or treats comprehensively a particular branch of knowledge, in articles usually arranged alphabetically by subject\" (1) . When asked to review the book, I was therefore curious as to how he would cover such a broad topic.",

As an example, the opening chapter is \"Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Modern Molecular Epidemiology and Perspectives.\" Four chapters later, a somewhat redundant chapter called \"Molecular or Immunological Tools for Effi cient Control of Tuberculosis\" appears. In between are unrelated chapters on livestock diseases, HIV/ AIDS molecular epidemiology, and uncultured pathogens; these are followed by chapters on leishmaniasis and epidemics of plant diseases.",

It contains full chapters on leishmaniasis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, cholera, hantavirus infection, and Chagas disease, and 2 chapters each on tuberculosis and malaria. Some of these chapters are relatively straightforward reviews; others use the disease for illustrative purposes only. The chapter on livestock diseases has 18 references; the one on leishmaniasis, 402. An important pathogen like Staphylococcus aureus is virtually unmentioned; Streptococcus pneumoniae does not even appear in the index.",

The book even contains a fascinating chapter devoted to archeological epidemiology (mummies) and a whopping 61-page chapter on infectious diseases and the arts, including an extensive list of movies with infectious disease themes.",
