Methods: Data on 479 male participants within two shelters who completed questionnaires and a total of 950 nasal and pharyngeal samples were collected during the winters of 2015e2017. Respiratory pathogen carriage including seven viruses and four bacteria was assessed by quantitative PCR. Results: The homeless population was characterized by a majority of individuals of North African origin (300/479, 62.6%) with a relatively high prevalence of chronic homelessness (175/465, 37.6%). We found a high prevalence of respiratory symptoms and signs (168/476, 35.3%), a very high prevalence of bacterial carriage (313/477, 65.6%), especially Haemophilus influenzae (280/477, 58.7%), and a lower prevalence of virus carriage (51/473, 10.8%) with human rhinovirus being the most frequent (25/473, 5.3%). Differences were observed between the microbial communities of the nose and throat. Duration of homelessness (odds ratio (OR) 1.77, p 0.017), chronic respiratory diseases (OR 5.27, p <0.0001) and visiting countries of origin for migrants (OR 1.68, p 0.035) were identified as independent risk factors for respiratory symptoms and signs. A strong association between virus (OR 2.40, p 0.012) or Streptococcus pneumoniae (OR 2.32, p 0.014) carriage and respiratory symptoms and signs was also found. Conclusions: These findings allowed identification of the individuals at higher risk for contracting respiratory tract infections to better target preventive measures aimed at limiting the transmission of these diseases in this setting.

The challenges of poor environmental conditions, poor physical state, smoking habit, alcohol abuse or illicit drug consumption significantly impair their health status. Behind the frequent association with mental disease and unintentional injuries, homeless people are also predisposed to infectious diseases, especially respiratory infections such as tuberculosis and pneumonia [1] . A high prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases was recorded in the homeless, including bronchitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [2] . Respiratory diseases are frequently associated with death among homeless individuals [3] . Pulmonary tuberculosis is frequent in the homeless population and has been extensively studied [4, 5] .",

Infectious diseases are frequent among Marseille's sheltered homeless people, including lice and Bartonella quintana infection, hepatitis E and C, Tropheryma whipplei infection, skin infections and respiratory tract infections [7] . A 50% rate of respiratory symptoms and signs was observed in this population in winter 2005 [8] . About 8.7% carried at least one respiratory virus, with rhinovirus being the most frequent when sampled during the winters of 2010 and 2011 [9] . These preliminary findings demonstrated that respiratory infections might be frequent among sheltered homeless people in Marseille, warranting further investigation. We described socio-demographic characteristics, underlying chronic medical conditions and addictions, clinical respiratory symptoms and signs, and prevalence of respiratory viruses and bacteria (other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis) in the homeless population in two shelters of Marseille over the 2015e2017 period and investigated potential risk factors.",

We hypothesize that carriage of viral pathogens may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms as it is admitted that the vast majority of respiratory infections in adults are caused by rhinoviruses, coronaviruses and influenza viruses [10] ; whereas carriage of bacterial pathogens may not necessarily be associated with clinical signs and symptoms because bacterial microorganisms that are potential aetiological agents of respiratory tract infections are also part of the resident microbiome [11] . The secondary objective was to investigate the possible association between virusebacterium co-carriage or dual bacterial infections and respiratory symptoms and signs, as the pathogenic role of respiratory viruses in virusebacterium co-infected individuals remains unclear [12] and because interspecies interactions are suspected in individuals infected with several respiratory bacteria [13] .",

Shelter A has a special (dayenight) unit with a 35-bed capacity, dedicated to high-risk sedentary homeless people who are characterized by a high level of poverty, poor hygiene, alcoholism and mental illness. Adult homeless people were recruited on a voluntary basis. A medical doctor administered a standardized questionnaire addressing demographics, chronic medical conditions, chronic respiratory disease status (defined as suffering from one of the following conditions: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, occupational lung diseases, or pulmonary hypertension), substance abuse, vaccination status, symptoms and signs (cough, expectoration, rhinorrhoea, dyspnoea, sore throat, sibilants, rhonchi, crackles, headache, myalgia, conjunctivitis, fever) at enrolment and physically examined the participants. All participants signed an informed consent.

Variables with p values <0.2 from the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. Analysis of multicollinearity among the independent variables was performed using the 4 coefficient to test for correlation among binary variables; and for pairs of variables that were highly correlated (absolute value of correlation coefficient >0.7), only one variable was entered into the multivariate model. Multivariable logistic regression (created by stepwise regression) was used to determine factors associated with respiratory symptoms and signs.

We observed a high prevalence of respiratory symptoms and signs (35%) in line with the results of a survey conducted in Italy and the Netherlands [17, 18] . Dry or productive cough, rhinorrhoea and dyspnoea were the symptoms most frequently observed, suggesting that both upper and lower tract respiratory infections affect a significant proportion of sheltered homeless people during winter. We found relatively low rates of influenza virus infections. Cross sectional surveys took place when influenza was epidemic in the region of Marseille. Influenza vaccination rate in the homeless population screened in our surveys was in the same range as in Marseille's overall population [19, 20] . This result may indicate that the social isolation of homeless people might have a protective impact against community influenza virus transmission. One of the most important findings of this study is the very high prevalence of bacterial colonization by respiratory bacteria with H. influenzae (59%) and S. pneumoniae (13%) being the most frequent. A high prevalence of H. influenzae carriage (70%) was also observed by direct PCR in healthy infants from the western region of Gambia [21] and a rate of 40.9% was reported among children aged 6 years in day-care centres in eastern France [22] . In surveys conducted among healthy adults in the Australian Aboriginal population, the prevalence of non-typeable H. influenzae reached approximately 22.9% when culturing nasopharyngeal samples [23] . A 2.3% H. influenzae nasal prevalence was observed in Marseille's individuals originating from North Africa using quantitative PCR in 2013 [17] ; however, the survey was conducted in October, which may account for a lower prevalence, as shown in another healthy Italian children population [24] . Klebsiella pneumoniae nasopharyngeal carriage rates have been reported to range from 3% to 15%, which is in agreement with our results [25] . This bacterium is known to be frequently multidrug-resistant [25] and further studies on drug resistance in bacteria isolated from homeless people would be of interest.",
