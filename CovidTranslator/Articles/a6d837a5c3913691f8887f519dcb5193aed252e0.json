These then recruit and activate caspase-1 to promote inflammatory cell death via pyroptosis and cleavage/secretion of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) (Fig. 1a) .",

It is currently unclear whether these unique features are interlinked.

Here, we report significantly dampened activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bat primary immune cells compared to human or mouse counterparts.",

Such examples include Ebola virus, Nipah virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses, which are capable of causing severe, and often deadly, disease in humans and animals [1] [2] [3] [4] . These viruses, predominantly RNA viruses, are highly pathogenic in humans and are often linked to an aberrant innate immune activation [5] [6] [7] [8] . Importantly, bats, when challenged by these viruses, exhibit no or minimal signs of disease, even when high viral loads are detected in the sera or tissues [9] [10] [11] [12] . In addition, they are special in that they harbour a higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders 13 . Bats also have an extraordinarily long lifespan relative to their body size, despite their elevated metabolic rates 14, 15 .",

In addition, an in-house sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for bat IL-1\u03b2 was generated with cross-reactive antibodies ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ).

            "text": "Transcriptional priming of bat NLRP3 is impaired, independent of TLRs. Lack of ASC speck formation and downstream activation can be attributed to either the adaptor ASC or the sensor NLRP3, or both. NLRP3 expression is rate-limiting and transcriptional upregulation by NF-\u03baB through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) is an essential first step required for the inflammasome activation 43, 44 . We thus examined the transcriptional priming of both NLRP3 and IL-1\u03b2, along with classical NF-\u03baB-induced genes IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. BMDMs, BMDCs or PBMCs of bat and mouse or human were treated with various doses of four different NF-\u03baB-activating TLR agonists: LPS (bacterial lipopolysaccharide) for TLR4, Pam3CSK4 (bacterial triacylated lipopeptide) for TLR1/2, CL264 (adenine analogue) for TLR7 and poly(I:C) (viral dsRNA analogue) for TLR3. The majority of the TLR stimulations induced IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, up to 115-, 67-and 57-fold, respectively, in bat BMDMs (Fig. 2a) , 40-, 38-and 39-fold in bat BMDCs (Fig. 2c ) and 40-, 552-and 95-fold in bat PBMCs (Fig. 2e) , suggesting robust NF-\u03baB activation in these bat immune cells. However, NLRP3 was not induced with most of the TLR stimuli, except at higher doses when it was up to only threefold in bat BMDMs, fourfold in bat BMDCs and ninefold in bat PBMC (Fig. 2a ,c,e). In contrast, NLRP3 was significantly induced with higher amplitude for most stimuli in mouse BMDMs or BMDCs and human PBMCs (Fig. 2b ,d,f). Despite the differences in the amplitude of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1 responses to various stimulations between species, a more robust induction of NLRP3 in mouse or human cells compared to bat cells was observed with the TLR stimuli of similar potency for IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1 between species, such as CL264 in bat and mouse BMDMs (Fig. 2a,b) , CL264 and poly(I:C) for bat and mouse BMDCs, respectively (Fig. 2c,d) , and CL264 and LPS for bat and human PBMCs (Fig. 2e,f) . We excluded the possibility of a difference in NLRP3 basal expression level by comparing mRNA levels across bat and mouse tissues ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Comparable levels of NLRP3 transcripts relative to housekeeping genes between bat and mouse tissues were observed. Basal NLRP3 expression across bat tissues was 100 to 1,000 times lower than constitutively expressed inflammasome genes such as ASC and caspase-1, which is also consistent with the pattern seen in mouse tissues ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Collectively, these data indicate that bat NLRP3 has dampened transcriptional priming independent of TLR signalling.",

Transcriptome analysis revealed only one ASC isoform, yet a NLRP3 splice-variant was identified. The alignment of full-length human and P. alecto NLRP3 proteins revealed 79% identity with two potential start codons in bat NLRP3 (Fig. 3a) . De novo assembly of mapped RNA-seq reads from P. alecto splenocyte subsets revealed an exon 7-skipping splice variant in bat NLRP3, not previously described in other mammalian orders (Fig. 3b) . The exon 7 region was located within the leucinerich repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3. Both exon 7-positive and exon 7-negative variants were validated by PCR and sequencing from spleen and thymus cDNA. This exon 7-negative isoform constituted more than 60% of NRLP3 transcripts in different P. alecto tissues (Fig. 3c ). The four isoforms with different start codons and/or alternative splicing are designated 1 to 4 (Fig. 3d) . Human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) reporter cells stably expressing human/ bat ASC-mPlum fusions and transiently expressing human/bat NLRP3-mCitrine fusions were used for ImageStream and immunoblot analysis. For ImageStream analysis, double-positive cells of similar fluorescent intensity for ASC-mPlum and NLRP3-mCitrine were gated. This revealed that formation of bat ASC specks and their downstream cleavage of IL-1\u03b2 was not different from human ASC, in response to all NLRP3 variants ( Fig. 3e ,f,i). In addition, the microscopic structures of specks including size, density and shape were comparable between human and bat ASC ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ).",

Evolutionary analysis using 10 bat and 17 non-bat mammalian NLRP3 sequences confirmed NLRP3 was under higher selection pressure in the bat ancestor lineage compared to other mammals and the LRR domain was the only domain under significant positive selection (Supplementary Tables 1-3) , consistent with our chimaeric functional analysis.

It is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA (\u2212ssRNA) virus, known to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome 27 . All bat NLRP3 isoforms were significantly less responsive to IAV infection, while viral titres from supernatants were not affected ( Fig. 5a-c) . To validate this finding in freshly derived myeloid cells, we infected LPS-primed mouse or bat BMDMs or BMDCs with IAV at different multiplicities of infection (MOI = 1, 2, 5 or 10). MOI-dependent induction of ASC speck and IL-1\u03b2 secretion was observed in infected mouse BMDMs or BMDCs (Fig. 5d ,e and Supplementary Fig. 7a,b) . Although the IAV titre was similar between mouse and bat cells, ASC speck formation and IL-1\u03b2 secretion were minimally or not induced in infected bat BMDMs or BMDCs ( Supplementary  Fig. 8d ). Additionally, there was a decrease in viral titres with NLRP3 but no obvious difference between human and bat isoforms (Fig. 5i ). PRV3M infection (MOI = 1, 2, 5 or 10) in bat BMDMs or BMDCs also triggered less inflammasome activation without Human NLRP3 To expand this investigation to a third type of RNA virus, we interrogated inflammasome activation in response to MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, a positive-sense (+)ssRNA zoonotic virus from a recent epidemic with potential bat ancestry 46 . As mouse cells are not permissive to MERS-CoV 47 , human and bat PBMCs were infected. MERS-CoV infection (MOI = 0.25, 0.5 or 1) activated ASC speck and IL-1\u03b2 secretion in a MOI-dependent manner in human PBMCs (Fig. 5m,n) . This activation, abolished by pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 with a small-molecule inhibitor MCC950 48 , suggests NLRP3-dependent activation of the inflammasome by MERS. In contrast, MERS-CoV infection failed to trigger an inflammasome response in bat PBMCs, although viral titres only differed minimally between human and bat PBMCs (Fig. 5m-o and Supplementary Fig. 8c ).

            "text": "The exon 7-skipping alternative splice variant identified in both P. alecto and M. davidii has not been described previously in other mammalian orders based on the NCBI protein database. At the protein level, while an altered LRR domain is responsible for reduced function for the full-length protein, loss of exon 7 located within the LRR domain results in further dampened activity. Notably, the 'weaker' exon 7-negative isoforms are the predominant isoforms in P. alecto tissues. Our functional study is supported by evolutionary analysis (PAML branch model), which indicates a positive selection in the LRR domain in the bat ancestral lineage. The branch-site model, however, failed to identify a positively selected residue of NLRP3 in the bat ancestral lineage. This suggests that an altered LRR domain is probably a conserved feature in bats and possibly involves accumulated changes in different residues in different lineages of bats. At the steady sate, the LRR domain plays a role in auto-inhibition by preventing oligomerization of NLRP3 40 . Auto-inhibition of the LRR domain in bat NLRP3 could possibly be enhanced, hence making it harder for NLRP3 to trigger downstream activation. Interestingly, the same priming step for transcriptional upregulation also licenses NRLP3 activation by inducing post-translational modifications including deubiquitination in the LRR domain 52 . No key residues have been identified for auto-inhibition or ubiquitin modifications in the human/mouse LRR domain so far, and their roles are yet to be determined in the altered bat LRR. The NLRP3 inflammasome is increasingly being recognized to play a critical role in the immune response to viruses. In this study, we have discovered NLRP3-dependent activation of inflammation for a bat-related dsRNA virus (PRV3M) 45 and a coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with significant human spillover events. NLRP3 has no effect on viral titres for IAV and MERS-CoV infection in reconstituted iMACs and PBMCs, respectively. Interestingly, both human and bat NLRP3 mediated a similar decrease in viral titres from reconstituted iMACs infected by PRV3M, suggesting an NLRP3dependent and inflammasome-independent mechanism. NLRP3 inflammasome activation by dsRNA virus has only been inferred from transfecting isolated dsRNA from another reovirus 53 55 and an 'always on' interferon (IFN) system 56 might suggest elevated antiviral immunity in bats, a dampened STING-dependent IFN response to a DNA virus 21 and an inhibitory state of natural killer cells inferred from genome analysis support enhanced immune tolerance 16 . These hypotheses still largely lack functional confirmation, particularly with RNA virus infection. A recent study demonstrated a temperature-independent replication of Filoviruses on bat cells, as opposed to the 'flight as fever' hypothesis 57 . We demonstrate here a dampened NLRP3mediated inflammatory response to three different types of RNA virus in bat immune cells, with no or minimal difference in viral titres. This supports an enhanced innate immune tolerance rather than an enhanced antiviral defence in bats. This may also contribute to our understanding of the role of the inflammasome in disease tolerance in bats as reservoir hosts, in contrast to severe pathogenesis in spillover hosts for many high-profile emerging zoonotic viruses. As NLRP3 is recognized to sense an increasing number of viruses, this finding may have broad application in a great variety of bat-borne viruses or viruses yet to be detected in bats. With the ongoing development of more experimental tools and reagents for bat immunology, a deeper characterization of immune responses in other cell types/tissues and in vivo will provide greater insight into the underlying mechanisms of viral disease tolerance in bats.",

Where possible, wild bats with irreparable physical damage (torn wings) already scheduled for euthanasia were utilized. Processing of bats has been described previously 59 . Human blood was obtained from healthy donors with consent, approved by the National University of Singapore Institutional Review Board (NUS-IRB reference code H-18-029). PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare) density gradient centrifugation from P. alecto or human blood samples and stored in liquid nitrogen. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were obtained with permission from the Singhealth IACUC committee. P. alecto and mouse splenocytes were isolated by grinding the spleen through a 100 \u03bcm cell strainer followed by red blood cell lysis. P. alecto bone marrow cells were processed and differentiated with recombinant P. alecto macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) over 6 days into BMDMs or over 8 days with recombinant P. alecto granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) into BMDCs, as described previously 49 . Mouse bone marrow cells were harvested and differentiated into BMDMs or BMDCs over 6 days or 8 days of cultures using 10 ng ml \u22121 mouse M-CSF or 20 ng ml \u22121 mouse GM-CSF recombinant proteins (R&D System) 60 . Immortalized P. alecto and M. davidii kidney cells have been described previously 59, 61 . GP2-293 retroviral packaging cells were obtained from Clontech.
