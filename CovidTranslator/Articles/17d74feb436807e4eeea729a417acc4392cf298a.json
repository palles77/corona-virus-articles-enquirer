We explored the association between influenza death rates, transmissibility and several geographical and demographic indicators for the autumn and winter waves of the 1918-1919 pandemic in cities, towns and rural areas of England and Wales. Average measures of transmissibility, estimated by the reproduction number, ranged between 1.3 and 1.9, depending on model assumptions and pandemic wave and showed little spatial variation. Death rates varied markedly with urbanization, with 30-40% higher rates in cities and towns compared with rural areas. In addition, death rates varied with population size across rural settings, where low population areas fared worse. By contrast, we found no association between transmissibility, death rates and indicators of population density and residential crowding. Further studies of the geographical mortality patterns associated with the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic may be useful for pandemic planning.",

Past research has estimated that the reproduction number of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic ranged between 1.5 and 5.4 (Mills et al. 2004; Gani et al. 2005; Chowell et al. 2006 Chowell et al. , 2007a Ferguson et al. 2006; Sertsou et al. 2006; Viboud et al. 2006a; Massad et al. 2007; Nishiura 2007; Andreasen et al. in press) , depending on the specific location and pandemic wave considered, type of data, estimation method and level of spatial aggregation, which has ranged from small towns of a few hundred people to entire nations with several million inhabitants.

Although no census was conducted in 1918, the demographic data from the 1911 and 1921 census had very similar geographical patterns (correlationO0.99), so that our 1921 demographic estimates were deemed appropriate for the study of the 1918-1919 pandemic geographical patterns.

We assumed an initial exponential growth and estimated the intrinsic growth rate, 'r', by fitting a straight line (with slope r and intercept b) to the initial increase in weekly deaths (in logarithmic scale). The longest epidemic period consistent with exponential growth was determined by the goodness-of-fit test statistic (Chowell et al. 2007a ). The reproduction number was calculated by substituting the estimate for r into an expression derived from the linearization of the classical susceptibleexposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) transmission model (Lipsitch et al. 2003; Wallinga & Lipsitch 2007 )",

This expression for R assumes exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods, and the mean generation interval between two successive cases is given by T c Z1/b 1 C1/b 2 . We carried out a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of this assumption on the R estimates. We derived an upper bound for the extreme case of a fixed generation interval (delta distribution) using the following equation ( Wallinga & Lipsitch 2007) : There is considerable debate about the duration of the generation interval for influenza (Andreasen et al. in press) , with the most recent estimates relying on seasonal influenza transmission in households (Cauchemez et al. 2004; Ferguson et al. 2006) , while no data are available for pandemic influenza. Given the uncertainty, we considered two extreme values of the generation interval used in past research: a short interval of 3 days (where the latent and infectious periods were both set to 1.5 days; Ferguson et al. 2005 Ferguson et al. , 2006 Wallinga & Lipsitch 2007) and a longer interval of 6 days (latent periodZ1.9 days and infectious periodZ4.1 days; Longini et al. 2004; Mills et al. 2004 ).

Most locations experienced an initial epidemic phase lasting at least three epidemic weeks, so that R estimates derived from equation (2.1) could be obtained in 87% of administrative units and 100% of the counties for the autumn wave, and 69% of the units and 87% of the counties for the winter wave. Normal probability plots indicated that R estimates at the county level closely followed a normal distribution, while the distributions of estimates at the administrative unit level showed a greater frequency of high values compared with a normal distribution (not shown). In table 2, the summary estimates of R are presented for a short and long duration of the generation interval (3 and 6 days). For the shorter generation interval in the autumn wave, the mean R was found to be 1.40 (95% CI: 1.38-1.42) in the administrative units, with similar values at the county level.

By contrast, there was no association in urban areas (Gini index!0.05). Interestingly, variability in death rates entirely disappeared when the data were aggregated at the county level (Gini indexw0). We also characterized the relationship between population size and cumulative influenza deaths using a powerlaw function (DfN g ), stratified by urban and rural areas (figure 3). For rural areas, the exponent g estimates ranged between 0.71 and 0.77 (significantly below 1.0), whereas these estimates were approximately 1.0 for cities and towns. These estimates suggest that, in rural settings, smaller population units suffered a disproportionately large per capita mortality burden, whereas there was little variation in death rates across cities and towns.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first population study of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic at such a detailed spatial resolution. Our estimates of the reproduction number ranged between 1.3 and 1.9, with a low level of spatial variation across geographical units, which was only marginally associated with socio-demographic factors. By contrast, there was a marked spatial heterogeneity in death rates, which was linked to urbanization, with 30-40% higher rates in cities and towns than in rural areas on average. We evidenced further variations in death rates across rural settings, where smaller population units fared worse. Urban death rates did not vary with population size.",

As in several previous studies (Mills et al. 2004; Viboud et al. 2004 Viboud et al. , 2006a , we assumed that influenza mortality was a good proxy for disease incidence and was appropriate for the estimation of transmissibility. Our analyses were conducted with the assumption that reporting and coding of death certificates were homogeneous across England and Wales and over the course of the pandemic (vital statistics had been in place since 1837 in England and Wales, and all deaths were medically certified in 1918). One may expect that more remote locations would have poorer reporting or coding of deaths; however, we found higher death rates in rural units with lower population sizes, which argues against such bias. Finally, as in previous mortality studies (Ministry of Health 1920; Smallman-Raynor et al. 2004; Johnson 2006) , we relied on the administrative divisions of England and Wales in 1918, which are not necessarily the most meaningful spatial units for disease dynamics.",

Despite these observed variations in pandemic timing, it is noteworthy that the 1918-1919 pandemic as a whole was more synchronous in the administrative units of England and Wales than in US cities.

Furthermore, influenzarelated mortality rates were moderately associated with measures of density and baseline pre-pandemic mortality rates in 45 US cities (Pearl 1921; Bootsma & Ferguson 2007) . Similarly, in this study, we did not find any obvious association between death rates and measures of population density or residential crowding, or between death rates and pre-pandemic infant mortality rates (correlation approx. 0.30, not shown). Other studies, by contrast, have reported a strong effect of socio-demographic characteristics on the 1918-1919 pandemic mortality rates, including per capita income and indicators of wealth such as apartment size (Mamelund 2006; Murray et al. 2006 ).

Differential exposure to tuberculosis could have played a role, as this disease has been put forward as a predisposing factor for morbidity and mortality during the 1918 influenza pandemic (Pearl 1919; Noymer & Garenne 2000) , and tuberculosis was traditionally more prevalent in urban than rural settings.

            "text": "It is interesting that important residual variability in transmissibility estimates and death rates remained unexplained in our study. We think it unlikely that local differences in population age structure or public health interventions could have played a role. Children are believed to drive disease spread locally within cities or small communities ( Monto 1999) , although they probably do not disseminate infection over large distances ( Viboud et al. 2006b ). In our study, the proportion of the population comprising children did not explain geographical variations in transmissibility or death rates of the 1918-1919 pandemic (not shown). Although the 1918-1919 pandemic virus was characterized by an unusual age pattern of deaths concentrated among young adults (Olson et al. 2005) , the local differences in the proportion of young adults did not explain variations in death rates in our study (not shown). Public health interventions are irrelevant in the context of England and Wales, as no intervention was implemented in 1918-1919, in contrast to the USA (Bootsma & Ferguson 2007) . The existence of cross-immunity between the viruses circulating in successive waves of the 1918-1919 pandemic has been hypothesized (Anon. 1919; Andreasen et al. in press) , and may affect the geographical patterns described in this study. The cross-immunity hypothesis relies on anecdotal evidence supporting the idea that individuals who were infected with influenza during the summer escaped clinical illness or experienced only mild respiratory symptoms in the autumn (Anon. 1919) . Accordingly, Scandinavia experienced a large influenza morbidity wave in the summer of 1918, followed by a second wave of low mortality impact in the autumn, relative to other countries (Andreasen et al. in press). We were not able to fully investigate the impact of differential exposure to influenza during the summer of 1918 in England and Wales, due to the lack of morbidity data and extremely low death counts for this period. However, we found a weak but significant correlation between mortality rates in the summer and autumn waves, which is consistent with the cross-immunity hypothesis (Spearman rZ0.2, p!0.001). The possibility of cross-immunity also suggests that our rather low R estimates for the autumn and winter pandemic waves do not represent the maximum transmissibility of the 1918 influenza virus in an entirely naive population (the so-called R 0 ), which may have been as high as 5.4 (Andreasen et al. in press) .",

Influenza transmissibility results from a complex combination of pre-existing immunity patterns, population mixing and viral strain characteristics, while mortality is also affected by health care and sociodemographic conditions. Our results suggest that population size and urbanization played a role in the geographical patterns of the 1918-1919 pandemic in England and Wales. Whether these patterns can be generalized to contemporary seasonal influenza epidemics and future pandemics is an interesting topic for future research.",
