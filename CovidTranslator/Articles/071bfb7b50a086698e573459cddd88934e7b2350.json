Viremia has been documented 2 days postinoculation or infection and persists until the virus is neutralized by antibodies or the animal dies [5] . Gastric hypochlorhydria has been associated with CDV infection in ferrets [6] . The lack of gastric acid was hypothesized to be due to direct action of the virus on gastric mucosa or was secondary to the viral effect on the central nervous system.",

In ferrets, natural CDV infection most often consists of a catarrhal phase followed by a fatal neurotropic phase [9] . The initial phase is characterized by anorexia, pyrexia, conjunctivitis, and serous nasal discharge. An erythematous, pruritic rash appears on the chin (Fig. 1 ) and eventually spreads to the inguinal area [1, 9] . Hyperkeratosis of the footpads (Fig. 2 ) occurs inconsistently in ferrets [1] . Melena may be observed early in the course of the disease [1, 9] . Some ferrets die during the catarrhal phase secondary to bacterial infections, such as pneumonia. Clinical signs that are seen in the neurotropic phase include hyperexcitability, muscle tremors, hypersalivation, seizures, and coma. Ferrets die 12 to 16 days after being infected with ferret-adapted CDV [1, 8] . The disease has a longer course when ferrets are infected with a wild canine strain; death occurs 21 to 35 days postinfection [1] . Sometimes a decrease in temperature is observed by the time the animals become moribund [4] .",

A study demonstrated that virulent and attenuated CDV strains caused a severe leukopenia 1 week after infection [4] . Leukocyte counts from animals that were infected with virulent strains remained low, whereas those of animals that received attenuated strains progressively increased to reach preinfection, or near preinfection, values 35 days postinfection. The diagnosis of canine distemper is confirmed routinely by an immunofluorescence test on peripheral blood smear, buffy coat, or conjunctival scrapings in live animals. In experimentally-infected ferrets, a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used to detect the virus in peripheral blood [10] . Recently, nested-PCR was found to be a sensitive and specific method for diagnosis of CDV infection [11] .",

The virus is inactivated by heat, visible light, and commonly used disinfectants (0.75% phenol, 0.2% roccal, 2%-5% sodium hydroxide, and 0.1% formalin) [1, 3] . Some investigators reported that out of more than 1000 cases of distemper, not a single ferret survived the infection [8] . Blair et al [12] treated distemper in a 7-month-old ferret while in the catarrhal phase. The ferret's life span and quality of life were improved with treatments, but the neurotropic phase could not be prevented and the animal was euthanized. When faced with an outbreak of canine distemper in a ferret colony, euthanasia and repopulation following disinfection is recommended.",

Two vaccines are approved for use in ferrets in North America-Fervac-D Canine Distemper Vaccine (United Vaccines Inc., Madison, Wisconsin) and Purevax Ferret Distemper Vaccine (Merial, Athens, Georgia and Montre\u00b4al, Quebec, Canada). Fervac-D is a modified-live virus vaccine of chick cell origin. A 5.9% incidence of anaphylactic reaction has been reported with this vaccine [13] . Adverse events developed within 25 minutes and were characterized by hyperemia, hypersalivation, and vomiting. Purevax is a lyophilized vaccine of a recombinant canary pox vector that expresses the HA and F glycoproteins of CDV. The manufacturer uses the term ''ferret distemper'' vaccine on the product label to prevent confusion with their canine products; however, there is no such thing as a ''ferret distemper virus'' and ferrets are infected by CDV. The absence of adjuvant or entire distemper virus decreased postvaccination risks and the manufacturer reports an incidence of 0.3% reversible anaphylactic reactions in its field safety trials. Another modified-live canine distemper vaccine attenuated in primate cell line (Galaxy D, Schering Plough Animal Health, Omaha, Nebraska) has been studied in ferrets. This vaccine was effective in preventing canine distemper in young ferrets that were challenged with virulent CDV after two vaccine inoculations [14] ; however, the duration of immunity and the incidence of vaccine reactions are unknown. Clinical use of this vaccine is extra label (not approved for use in ferrets by USDA) and requires informed owner consent. Postvaccinal distemper infections were reported in black-footed ferrets that were vaccinated with chicken embryotissue culture-origin CDV vaccine and in domestic ferrets that were vaccinated with canine cell products [15, 16] . Therefore, vaccination of ferrets with these products must not be performed.",

At least three separate strains of Aleutian disease virus (ADV)-distinct from the mink strains-have been identified in ferrets [20, 21] .

Antibiotic may be indicated to prevent secondary bacterial infection, particularly in cases with suspected intestinal ulcerations. In these cases, administration of sucralfate and an H 2 antagonist (eg, cimetidine) also are beneficial. Sucralfate requires an acidic environment to be effective, so it should be given at least 30 minutes before an H 2 antagonist. Syringe feeding with a highly digestible diet (Science Diet A/D, Hill's Prescription Diet) may be indicated if anorexia persists. If clinical signs that are suggestive of maldigestion develop, oral administration of prednisone may be indicated. Use of an anti-inflammatory dose of prednisone for 1 to 4 weeks, was followed by gradual tapering of the dose successfully.",

Force feeding and offering water by syringe can be performed as needed. Treatments to relieve clinical symptoms should be done on a case by case basis. If coughing is persistent, a pediatric cough suppressant without alcohol (at the pediatric dosage on a per weight basis) has been used [59] . To alleviate nasal congestion, the use of an antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine (2-4 mg/kg, by mouth, every 8 to 12 hours) [8, 59] , or intranasal delivery of phenylephrine may help [68] . Antibiotics may be indicated to control secondary bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. Neonates typically succumb to secondary bacterial infections. Therefore, antibiotics may be useful in these patients to reduce mortality [69] .",

These reports brought great controversy over the acceptability of keeping ferrets as pets with regard to the potential risk for rabies. This was because the period of viral shedding in the animal's saliva-before the onset of recognizable signs-was unknown at that time [1, 79, 80] . To the author's knowledge, there is no reported case of human rabies secondary to a ferret bite. Since 1958, less than 30 cases of rabies in domestic ferrets have been reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control [81, 82] . One of theses cases was attributed to vaccinating a ferret with modified-live virus rabies vaccine [1] .",

Signs were reported to be mild in ferrets that were inoculated with the European red fox rabies variant [82] . Mean morbidity period was 4 to 5 days [81, 83] . Mortality in ferrets that were inoculated with the European red fox variant was dose dependent [82] . In the study that used skunk variant, ferret susceptibility was dose dependent and the incubation period was inversely proportional to dose [81] . In contrast, ferrets that were inoculated with raccoon variant were only moderately susceptible-regardless of dose-and there was no correlation found between viral dose and incubation period [83] .

Vaccinated ferrets had a survival rate of 89% compared with less than 6% for unvaccinated controls [87] . Domestic ferrets that were vaccinated with a commercially inactivated rabies vaccine showed rapid induction of virusneutralizing antibody-a seroconversion that persisted at least 7 months [88] . Based on these studies, killed rabies vaccines were approved for immunizing ferrets [89, 90] (Table 2 ). Ferrets should be vaccinated once at 3 months of age or older and then annually thereafter [87] . An animal is considered to be immunized if the primary vaccination was administered at least 28 days previously [89] . Because a rapid anamnestic response is expected, an animal is considered to be vaccinated currently immediately after booster vaccination [89] . Local injection site reactions were reported to develop frequently with rabies vaccine [91] . Studies in cats showed that rabies vaccines more consistently produce granulomatous inflammation at vaccine sites, although leukemia virus vaccines are incriminated more often in the pathogenesis of vaccine-associated sarcomas [92] [93] [94] . There is only one report of vaccineassociated sarcoma in a ferret [91] . The ferret had been vaccinated for distemper and rabies on an annual basis in the dorsal area of the neck or interscapular area, so it is impossible to determine from which vaccine the tumor arose. Practitioners should consider establishing a protocol in regard to the site of administration of rabies and distemper vaccines. This would allow the determination of which vaccine may be involved in the event that a tumor develops.",

An atypical rotavirus was isolated from neonatal ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) that had diarrhea at a large commercial farm in the United States. The disease was recognized at the ferret farm for several years and was referred as ''ferret kit disease'' [1] . Partial characterization identified this virus as an atypical rotavirus, based on the lack of rotavirus group A common antigen and on its distinct double-stranded RNA electropherotype pattern in polyacrylamide gels. In Finland, a rotavirus outbreak in ferret kits had a mortality rate that approached 100% [1] .",

The prevalence of this viral infection is unknown in ferrets because of the absence of reliable serologic tests. On postmortem examination, gross lesions are limited to the gastrointestinal tract.
