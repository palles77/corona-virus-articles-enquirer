Although it was first identified in Europe, it has become increasingly problematic in many Asian countries, including Korea, China, Japan, the Philippines, and Thailand. The economic impacts of the PEDV are substantial, given that it results in significant morbidity and mortality in neonatal piglets and is associated with increased costs related to vaccination and disinfection. Recently, progress has been made in understanding the molecular epidemiology of PEDV, thereby leading to the development of new vaccines. In the current review, we first describe the molecular and genetic characteristics of the PEDV. Then we discuss its molecular epidemiology and diagnosis, what vaccines are available, and how PEDV can be treated.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED), which was first observed among English feeder and fattening pigs in 1971 [1] , is a devastating enteric disease that manifests as sporadic outbreaks during the winter, leading to damage on breeding farms. Characterised by watery diarrhoea, PED resembles transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), but has less of an effect on suckling pigs (\\4-to 5-week old); this is what allowed PED to first be distinguished from the TGE virus and other recognized enteropathogenic agents. As it spread through Europe, the disease was named 'epidemic viral diarrhoea (EVD) .' Unlikely what the disease used to outbreak in fattening pigs, different types of EVD caused acute diarrhoea in pigs of all ages in 1976. This type of EVD was classified as EVD type 2 [1] , different from the previously recognized type 1 [2] . EVD type2 was turned out to be caused by a coronavirus-like agent in 1978 [3, 4] using experimentally designed CV777 which caused enteropathogenic infection in both piglets [3] and fattening swine. This was when the disease started to be called as 'Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea (PED)' [4] .",

PEDV ranges in diameter from 95 to 1990 nm (mean diameter: 130 nm), including its projection. As in many particles with a tendency to a round shape, the PEDV contains a centrally located electronopaque body; it also possesses widely spaced club-shaped projections measuring 18-23 nm in length. The internal structure of the virus remains unknown. The PEDV is sensitive to ether and chloroform and has a density in sucrose of 1.18 g/ml. The virus possesses a glycosylated peplomer (spike, S) protein, Poll (P1), envelope (E), glycosylated membrane (M) protein, and an unglycosylated RNA-binding nucleocapsid (N) protein [5] . Cell cultureadapted PEDV loses its infectivity when heated to C60\u00b0C for 30 min, but is moderately stable at 50\u00b0C; further, the virus is stable between pH 5.0 and 9.0 at 4\u00b0C and between pH 6.5 and 7.5 at 37\u00b0C [6] . PEDV shows no haemagglutinating activity [6] .",

PED is currently a source of concern in Asia, where outbreaks are often more acute and severe than those observed in Europe. In this respect, and in their high mortality rates, these resemble TGEV outbreaks. For example, Japanese outbreaks between September 1993 and June 1994 resulted in 14,000 deaths, with mortality ranging from 30 to 100% in suckling pigs. During these epidemics, adult pigs showed only temporary decreases in appetite and milk production [7] . Another PED epidemic occurred in the winter of 1996, during which 39,509 of 56,256 infant farrow-to-finish piglets died after experiencing diarrhoea. Between January 1992 and December 1993, 56.3% of viral enteric cases in infant pigs surveyed in Korea were attributable to PEDV, rather than TGEV. The vast majority of outbreaks (90%) involved piglets \\10-day-old [8] . The clinical lesions of PEDV in the small intestine of piglets were similar to those of TGEV. Lesions are confined to the small intestine, which is distended with yellow fluid (Fig. 1 ). PED outbreaks also occurred in Thailand from 2007 to 2008. Most of the affected farms reported that the disease first occurred in farrowing barns; 100% of newborn piglets were subsequently lost. Between August 1997 and July 1999, 50.4% of 1,258 enteric cases across 5 Korean provinces were diagnosed as PED [9] ; further, a Korean abattoir serosurvey found PEDV seroprevalences of 17.6-79% (mean of 45%) in samples from 469 pigs from seven provinces. Cumulatively, these results suggest that the virus had become endemic in some areas [10] ( Table 1) . However, recent outbreaks seemed to be concentrated in certain countries where pork industry is prevalent, such as Philippines, South Korea and China.",

Genes for the major structural proteins S (150-220 kDa), week of age died from severe watery diarrhoea after showing signs of dehydration. After the acute outbreak, piglets were anorectic, depressed, vomiting, and producing water faeces that did not contain any signs of blood. Necropsies of deceased piglets from the Kimpo outbreak uncovered gross lesions in the small intestines, which were typically fluidic, distended, and yellow, containing a mass of curdled, undigested milk. Atrophy of the villi caused the walls of the small intestines to become thin and almost transparent Virus Genes (2012) 44:167-175 169 E (7 kDa), M (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) , and N (58 kDa) are located downstream of the polymerase gene [15, 18, 20] . The ORF3 gene, which is an accessory gene, is located between the structural genes. It encodes an accessory protein, the number and sequence of which varies among different coronaviruses [20] . The PEDV S protein is a type I glycoprotein composed of 1,383 amino acids (aa). It contains a signal peptide (1-18 aa), neutralising epitopes (499-638, 748-755, 764-771, and 1,368-1,374 aa), a transmembrane domain (1,334-1,356 aa), and a short cytoplasmic domain. The S protein can also be divided into S1 (1-789 aa) and S2 (790-1,383 aa) domains based on its homology with S proteins of other coronaviruses [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Like other coronavirus S proteins, the PEDV S protein is a glycoprotein peplomer (surface antigen) on the viral surface, where it plays a pivotal role in regulating interactions with specific host cell receptor glycoproteins to mediate viral entry, and stimulating induction of neutralising antibodies in the natural host [15, 21-23, 26, 27] . Moreover, it is associated with growth adaptation in vitro, and attenuation of virulence in vivo [28, 29] . Thus, the S glycoprotein would be a primary target for the development of effective vaccines against PEDV. Additional studies of this structure are essential for understanding the genetic relationships between, and diversity of, PEDV isolates, the epidemiological status of PEDV in the field, and the association between genetic mutations and viral function [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . It was reported that aminopeptidase N is the receptor of TGEV, human coronavirus 229E (HcoV-229E) and feline coronavirus (FeCoV) which all belong to group I coronavirus including PEDV [34] .",

The M protein not only plays an important role in the viral assembly process [36, 37] but also induces antibodies that neutralise the virus in the presence of its complement [37, 38] . The M protein may play a role in a-interferon (a-IFN) induction [39] . Coexpression of M and E proteins allowed the formation of pseudoparticles, which exhibited interferogenic activity similar to that of complete virions [40] . Additional work on the M glycoprotein should increase our understanding of the genetic relationships between, and the diversity of PEDV isolates and the epidemic situation of PEDV in the field [30, [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] .",

On the contrary, their expression might lead to decreases of viral fitness in vitro, and mutants with inactivated accessory genes are easily selected during serial passage through cell cultures [50] [51] [52] [53] . In general, accessory genes are maintained in field strains [50, 54] , and their loss mainly results in attenuation in the natural host [55] [56] [57] . In the case of PEDV, the only accessory gene is ORF3, which is thought to influence virulence; cell culture adaptation has been used to alter the ORF3 gene in order to reduce virulence [52] , as has been done for TGEV [53] . Differentiation of ORF3 genes between the highly cell-adapted viruses and field viruses could be a marker of adaptation to cell culture and attenuation of the virus [52, 58, 59] . Thus, measures of variation in ORF3 gene differentiation could be a valuable tool in molecular epidemiology studies of the PEDV [42, 45, 52, 59] .",

Due to the similarities in causative agents of diarrhoea, differential diagnosis is necessary to identify the PEDV in the laboratory [64, 65] . Many techniques have been used for the detection of PEDV, including immunofluorescence (IF) tests, immunohistochemical techniques, direct electron microscopy, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). However, these techniques are time-consuming and are low in sensitivity and specificity [66] . Kim et al. [67] compared three techniques (RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization) for the detection of PEDV. They concluded that although RT-PCR identified the presence of PEDV more frequently than the other methods, when only formalin-fixed tissues are submitted, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization would be useful methods for the detection of PEDV Ag and nucleic acid. The PEDV leader sequence was used to develop a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnostic technique [68, 69] that has successfully been used to detect both laboratory and field isolates [70, 71] . M gene-derived primers can be used in an RT-PCR system to obtain PEDV-specific fragments [69] , and duplex RT-PCR has been used to differentiate between TGEV and PEDV [66] . The past few years have seen several useful modifications of the basic RT-PCR method. For instance, it is possible to estimate the potential transmission of PEDV by comparing viral shedding load with a standard internal control DNA curve [72] , as well as to perform multiplex RT-PCR to detect PEDV in the presence of various viruses [73] -a technique that is particularly useful for rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective diagnosis of acute swine viral gastroenteritis). The commercial dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) system (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) was also developed for the rapid differential detection of PEDV. It employs a single tube 1-step multiplex RT-PCR with two separate primer segments to block a non-specific priming [74] .",

After antigenic sensitisation in the gut, IgA immunocytes migrate to the mammary gland, where they localise and secrete IgA antibodies into colostrum and milk. This 'gut-mammary' immunologic axis is an important concept in designing optimal vaccines to provide effective lactogenic immunity [83] . Pigs that regularly suckle the immune mother are constantly inoculating their lumens with milk-bound IgA antibodies, a process that confers passive immunity. IgG accounts for more than 60% of colostrum immunoglobulin content. However, IgA is more effective at neutralising orally infectious pathogens than either IgG or IgM because it is more resistant to proteolytic degradation in the intestinal tract and has a higher virus neutralising ability than IgG and IgM [84] . Therefore, only passive transfer of IgA from an immunised mother effectively induces immune responses in suckling piglets [85] .

However, in Europe, the disease caused by PEDV was not of sufficient economic importance to start the vaccine development. Therefore, the trial of vaccine development was mainly accomplished in Asian countries where the PEDV outbreaks have been so severe that the mortality of the new born piglets was increased. An alternative vaccine for suckling piglets may be an attenuated form of the virus derived from serial passage (passage level: 93) of the PEDV [86] . In Japan, a commercial attenuated virus vaccine of cell cultureadapted PEDV (P-5V) has been administered to sows since 1997.

Further, this vaccine candidate remained safe even after three back passages in piglets [88] . Piglet mortality can be reduced by orally inoculating pregnant sows with the DR13 strain. The viral strain was licensed, and used as an oral vaccine in South Korea from 2004 (patent No. 0502008). And the oral vaccine was registered and commercialised in Philippine at 2011. Despite the documented benefits of the DR13 vaccine, it does not significantly alter the duration of virus shedding-an indication of immune protection [79, 89] in challenged piglets. Shorter periods of virus shedding, as well as reduced severity and duration of diarrhoea in piglets, result from higher titres of serum antibodies; complete protection from PEDV infection prevents shedding after exposure to viral challenge [90] . Oral immunisation with highly attenuated PEDV confers partial protection against virulent challenge in conventional pigs, a result that is related to inoculation dose. At low doses of the attenuated PEDV, 25% of pigs are protected against PEDV challenge, but this proportion increased to 50% when pigs were inoculated with a dose 20 times stronger [91] . However, viral shedding may be difficult to measure accurately, as it is varies depending on viral strain and sensitivity of the detection tool [72] .",

After infection with PEDV, levels of antibody secreting cell (ASC) in the gut were similar to those observed in response to TGEV and rotavirus infection; IgG ASCs were more prevalent than IgA ASCs. In PEDV-infected pigs, a limited number of IgM ASCs were detected at post infection day (PID) 4, and memory B cells appeared at PID 21 in mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and blood. Finally, the authors noted correlations between protection and both serum isotype-specific antibody and ASC response in gut-associated lymph tissues and blood on the challenge day [90] [91] [92] .",

For instance, anti-PEDV chicken egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) and colostrums from immunized cows have been found to increase survival rates of virally challenged piglets [95, 96] . Mouse monoclonal single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies to neutralised PEDV, which can be expressed in E. coli, are as potent as parental antibodies and block PEDV infection into target cells in vitro [97] . Thus, it is possible that recombinant E. coli cells expressing scFv can be used as prophylactic agents against PEDV infection. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), which stimulates the proliferation of intestinal crypt epithelial cells and promotes recovery from atrophic enteritis in PEDVinfected piglets [98] , has also been proposed as a potential novel therapy to promote intestinal villous recovery in piglets with PEDV infections; it may also be useful in other species with viral atrophic enteritis. Drawbacks of this treatment include its high price and questionable safety.",

Diarrhoea was reproduced in experimental pigs with one of the isolates, designated CV777, which was found to be distinct from the 2 known porcine coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus.",
