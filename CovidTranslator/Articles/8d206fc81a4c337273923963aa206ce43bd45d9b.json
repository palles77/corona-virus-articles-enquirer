Since the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, various public health measures have been promoted first to contain, then to mitigate, the pandemic. Some of these measures contradicted recommendations issued by the World Health Organization and were of questionable efficacy. However, travelers may benefit from targeted recommendations on influenza risk reduction (eg, by social distancing or immunization). These recommendations are particularly indicated for those with an increased personal risk profile and for those likely to be exposed to influenza patients.",

The latest World Tourism Organization statistics had reported 922 million International Tourist Arrivals for the year 2008, although a clear negative growth was experienced in the second half of 2008 [1] . Although many countries initially attempted aggressive containment as the initial strategy to limit the spread of infection, it soon became obvious that the virus had already spread worldwide. Mitigation to win time (ie, until vaccines would be widely available) soon became the logical strategy. The WHO explicitly did not recommend restricting international travel; moreover, it never did. Nevertheless, various national authorities imposed restrictive or diagnostic measures, although many of these measures previously were demonstrated to be ineffective (Table 1) .",

The risk of influenza transmission related to travel (eg, at airports, in the aircraft cabin) is undetermined; only three reports of in-flight transmission have been published [3] . The aircraft as a vector for global spread of influenza is of greater concern. In the current pandemic, it has been demonstrated that countries receiving more than 1,400 passengers from Mexico were at a significantly elevated risk for importation of pandemic (H1N1) 2009; international air traffic alone was more than 92% sensitive and specific in predicting importation [4\u2022 ]. However, a variety of other respiratory viruses have also been diagnosed during that phase, including rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza B, and parainfluenza virus, illustrating that many different viral transmissions can simultaneously occur even during a pandemic [5] . Travel-associated spread of influenza (H1N1) 2009 at a rock music festival in Belgium was reported [6] . However, although this pandemic had a significant impact during the winter in Australia, \"swine flu\" hardly affected consumers' outbound travel plans [7] .",

A pilot study has demonstrated that screening at disembarkation requires large numbers of staff [15] . Because viral shedding in influenza patients starts 1 to 2 days before the onset of symptoms [16] , entry screening is not a method that would allow detection of asymptomatic passengers during the incubation period. Persistent viral shedding may potentially allow for transmission after patients recover clinically [17] . Symptomatic passengers may use antipyretic agents to pass thermal screening undetected. The value of border screening in deterring travel by ill persons and in building public confidence is unsubstantiated. Also, the value of health alerts or other information leaflets and posters remains to be evaluated.

While preparing for a possible second wave of the pandemic, vaccination gained emphasis in the prevention of influenza (H1N1) 2009; the 2010 seasonal Southern hemisphere vaccine will contain the pandemic strain. In addition to vaccination, other measures (eg, hygiene practices and social distancing) are important to maintain good health during travel. Travelers will continue to benefit from specific advice targeting influenza prevention.",
