Although this disease is considered enzootic in Europe and parts of Asia, it is rarely seen in the Western Hemisphere since its eradication from Mexico in 1992. In recent years, three cases of RHD have been identified in the United States. Due to the quick action of veterinarians these cases were confined and controlled before the disease could spread.",

            "text": "Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease was first recognized in China in 1984. The epicenter of the outbreak occurred in a group of commercially bred Angora rabbits recently imported from Germany to Jiangsu Province, China. These rabbits soon exhibited a contagious rapidly fatal disease that spread over 50,000 square kilometers in 9 months killing 470,000 rabbits. This disease was variously called \"X-Disease of Rabbits,\" \"rabbit viral sudden death,\" \"picornavirus hemorrhagic fever in rabbits,\" \"hemorrhagic septicemia syndrome in rabbits,\" and \"infectious necrotic hepatitis of leporidae.\" Today, this disease is known as Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease (RHD), Viral Hemorrhagic Disease of rabbits, or Rabbit Calicivirus Disease (RCD). Since 1984, RHD has disseminated widely and has been reported in over 40 countries from Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. [1] [2] [3] [4] Disease RHD is caused by the Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV). RHDV is a member of the family Caliciviridae, genus Lagovirus, and is closely related but distinct from the European Brown Hare syndrome virus, which causes similar symptoms and disease as RHDV in hares. 4 RHDV is readily disseminated. Virus is shed in the feces and nasal secretions of infected rabbits. Both ingested and inhaled virus can result in infection. The virus is stable in the environment. This allows RHDV to be spread by contact with contaminated caging, shavings, bowls, feedstuffs, and other fomites. The virus can also be passively transported by flies over short distances and can also travel by movement of people, equipment, wild or domestic animals, pelts, and rabbit carcasses. 3 The incubation period for RHDV is short, only16 to 48 hours. RHDV is highly infectious and highly virulent. As a result, morbidity and mortality rates may reach 90% to 100%. Death usually occurs between 2 and 3 days postinfection, although some rabbits may live for several days before they die. The disease is confined to rabbits over 2 months of age. It is believed maternal immunity protects the infant rabbits from this disease. As the maternal immunity declines at 2 months of age, the rabbits become susceptible to RHDV. [1] [2] [3] Three forms of the disease are recognized depending on past history of the disease in the affected rabbit population. A peracute form of the disease occurs in na\u00efve rabbit populations. In this form of the disease, rabbits die suddenly, exhibiting no or very few signs. The acute form of the RHD is seen in rabbit populations where the disease is enzootic. These rabbits typically show some signs of disease before death. A subacute form of the disease is uncommon and occurs in the later stages of an epizootic. In this form of the disease, affected rabbits are clinically ill, but many survive. [1] [2] [3] Several clinical signs have been observed in rabbits both experimentally infected with RHDV and those that were naturally infected (Fig 1) . Not all clinical signs were present in every animal. Animals may have a temperature above 104\u00b0F (41\u00b0C), show rapid respiration, cyanosis, and become anorexic and recumbent. Severe diarrhea is common. In the late stages of the disease, various neurological signs are apparent, including lateral recumbency, paddling, ataxia, and terminally frenetic behavior sometimes accompanied by squealing. Opisthotonos has been observed in many animals, and 20% of infected rabbits have a bloody foamy discharge from their nose and, less frequently, from the vagina (Fig 2) .",

Liver enzymes also are expected to be elevated. 2, 3 Typically, rabbits dying with RHD are in good body condition and have recently ingested food. RHD causes a severe diffuse necrotic hepatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The liver may be pale, yellow, gray, friable, or congested and have a distinct lobular pattern. Multifocal petechial hemorrhages occur in the liver, lungs, kidneys and heart (Figs 3 and 4) . The spleen is often dark and engorged. Pneumotracheitis and tracheal hemorrhage are common, and jaundice has been occasionally noted. Lesions of the digestive tract are usually absent, although in some outbreaks, a catarrhal enteritis is a feature of RHD. In cases of acute RHD the characteristic hemorrhages might not be present. [1] [2] [3] Microscopic lesions of the liver are characterized by an acute diffuse hepatic necrosis and hemorrhage with minimal inflammation. Round eosinophilic inclusion bodies are seen in hepatocytes. Lymphoid necrosis in the spleen and lymph nodes is another characteristic lesion of RHD. Glomeronephritis, encephalomyelitis, and enteritis also may be seen histologically. 1-3 Figure 1 . Rabbit with Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease. This animal is severely depressed and poorly responsive.

Realizing the drastic affects of RHD, and to prevent it from spreading, the Mexican Government conducted extensive serological surveys from 1989 to 1992, depopulating all seropositive animals and their contacts. During the course of the eradication campaign, 120,579 rabbits were destroyed, and in 1992, Mexico became the first country to successfully eradicate RHD.1,3 While the rest of the world tried to contain the spread of RHD, Australia has used this disease in an attempt to mitigate the impact of the introduced European rabbit to its agriculture and wildlife. In 1991, Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus was imported into the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) to conduct studies on its efficacy at killing rabbits and its species specificity. The AAHL confirmed that RHD was species-specific to the European Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Based on this information, field trials were started on Wardang Island, South Australia in March of 1995. Despite many precautions, RHD escaped quarantine in September 1995. The disease rapidly spread throughout South Australia. By December 1995 the virus had crossed state lines. In a 2-month period, RHD killed 10 million rabbits.7,8",
