However, with the advent of new instrumentation and technology in the late 1970's, especially recombinant DNA methods, biology became progressively more reductionist, with a focus on individual cells and molecules, and immunology was no exception to this trend. The new knowledge acquired by the field through many such detailed studies has been enormously important in developing a parts list of the components involved in immune processes and in identifying some of the contributions of these molecular and cellular elements to the overall functioning of the system. Nonetheless, this information has still yielded only limited insights into the way these various elements integrate with each other to give rise to complex immunological behaviors, especially into how small quantitative changes in individual component function affect more global properties. This latter issue is of substantial importance in understanding how polymorphisms linked to disease by large-scale genetic studies influence immune function, as just one example.",

Rather than exploring a single element in depth, these latter technologies are employed for broad probing of the state of biological systems (gene expression, protein identity, or substrate modification). This has led to a major change in how research is conducted in many laboratories -rather than experiments being designed based on pre-formed hypotheses derived from past training and knowledge of the literature, high-throughput methods are being used for unbiased exploration of the properties of a system to then generate novel hypotheses (5) . It is up to the investigator to sort through the massive amount of new data flowing from the various multiplex technologies, a process that requires substantial ability in statistics and/or the capacity to properly use algorithms and software developed by experts in mathematics and computation. We have thus entered a new domain, in which the skills of 'bioinformaticians' are becoming essential elements in the research efforts of many laboratories. The technical capacity to generate these largescale, in some cases global, datasets has in turn led to the emergence of the new discipline of 'systems biology', which in its simplest form is the old physiology recast in modern guise. It constitutes an attempt by the field to move from the very specific, from the detail, from the single molecule or gene, to a quantitative analysis of such elements as they operate together to give rise to behaviors not possessed by any single component alone -so-called 'emergent properties,' (6) the symphony rather than the notes of just the violin or oboe.",

While statistical analysis of large datasets to look for trends, to cluster individual components into related groups, or to uncover connectivity among elements to produce large network maps are all essential to making use of such extensive information, these approaches alone fall short of moving the field from mere organization of knowledge to a deeper understanding of the principles underlying a system's behavior or to an explanation of its mode of operation. The most common output from informatic manipulation of data elements is a non-parametric graph that shows qualitative interactions -often referred to as a 'hairball' or 'ridiculome' 1 because of the enormous complexity of such global depictions. In truth, these graphs are extremely useful for illustrating relationships between elements and for understanding the organization of components into operational modules, but they do not allow the investigator to predict how alterations in the concentration or efficiency of function of a particular element will influence the overall system's activity or to discern why/how certain properties of the system arise from its elements. But in the end, this is just what we want from such a systemic analysis; the ability to fathom how higher-level function emerges from components that on their own lack the capacity in question and to predict how perturbations of individual elements will change this behavior, both for the basic insight this provides and for the potential clinical utility of such information.",

But we believe that the two are complementary and indeed, each cannot reach its full potential without the other. Computational simulation is only effective if the modeler has in hand the properly processed and analyzed data necessary to instantiate a model close to biological reality (in terms of element identity, organization, and quantitative parameters). At any level of resolution, from molecules, to cells, to tissues, to a complete organism, the modeler needs the contributions of informaticians to develop a realistic and valid model structure for further computational processing. On the other hand, without modeling, the mere organization of data does not add the necessary insight into global system performance sought by biologists.",

In this review we argue that these existing paradigms are changing -that the value of traditional experimental studies will increase dramatically if more quantitative tools are introduced into mainstream immunology research in the form of analytic measurements, formalized model generation, simulations, and computer predictions, built on a foundation involving systematic measurements organized and parsed by informatics approaches.",

Add to this the exponential increase and decrease in lymphocyte cell numbers during adaptive immune responses, properties that markedly amplify the influence of very small differences in the activity of molecular circuits or cells (9; 10) , and the need for more formal representations and quantitative analyses of immune function becomes even more evident.",

Rather, we are referring to combining rich experimental datasets and existing knowledge in the field with newer efforts to obtain more quantitative measurements of biochemical or cellular parameters suitable for computer modeling and simulation. Predictions of system behavior from such simulations obtained under defined conditions corresponding to experimentally testable situations amount to 'in silico experimentation' (11) . These predicted outcomes must then be put to the test at the bench, to examine the strength of the underlying computational model. Through iterative cycles of such model building, simulation, prediction, experiment, and model refinement (when experimental results and prediction disagree as they inevitably will), one can develop much more complete and informative models of immunological processes than those we formulate purely in our imagination or represent as simplified cartoons in reviews.",

            "text": "What about the scale of such models? Many investigators bemoan the presumed need for 'completeness' in order to achieve a useful model and despair of obtaining the data needed to reach this ultimate goal. Although for bacteria or yeast it is possible to undertake truly 'system-level' studies involving the measurement all gene transcripts or proteins expressed by a cell under various conditions and the systematic perturbation of each of these elements through mutation, this is clearly impractical or impossible for more complex organisms. However, useful models that represent emergent behaviors need not involve the entire system -the complex properties of subcircuits or modules that form key parts of larger networks are valuable to investigate and simulate on their own (7; 12) even if the eventual goal must be to stitch such incomplete models together into a grander scheme that more truly reflects overall physiology. To conduct studies at the 'systems' level, it is merely necessary to at least move up the scale from individual component dissection to a consideration of integrated behavior of sets of connected components (molecules, cells, even disparate tissues). Such efforts help us organize our thinking about the aspects of the subnetwork's structure that give rise to its specific properties [amplification, noise suppression, time-gated function, and so on (13) ], and can assist in understanding the underlying control circuits that regulate behaviors like switching between tolerant and immune states (8) , the antigen thresholds required for induction of responses, original antigenic sin, the choice of CD4 effector fate, and many others. In concert with the critical efforts already underway to systematically obtain data on gene expression in immune cells (14) and to quantify aspects of immune function previously examined in a more qualitative manner, we can begin to generate a body of models for many such modules of immune function. These in turn can each be refined by contributions from many investigators in the field, hopefully over time approaching the underlying reality more and more closely, and leading eventually to the generation of an integrated 'supermodel' as these smaller pieces prove their worth through rigorous experimental testing. It is an opportunity for all immunologists to contribute to and receive back from a group undertaking that ultimately supports their own specific research interests while advancing the entire field. Rather than being concerned about 'big science' in thinking about systems approaches, we hope that immunologists will view systems immunology as the new immunophysiology, with opportunities for all to participate and to benefit.",

Although substantial progress has been made in simulation techniques and in the development of specialized computer hardware that permit ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations of large peptide folding processes (15; 16) , the most fundamental scale of computational models widely used in immunology is the scale describing the dynamics of molecular interactions in terms of rates of association, dissociation, and post-translational modification. Based on such molecular event rates, dynamic models can be developed that cast the time evolution of a particular part of cellular biochemistry into mathematical expressions that describe the rate of change per unit time of the number of its molecular species. Depending on the specific question at hand, the focus of such mathematical descriptions may be on the formation of individual multi-molecular signaling complexes ('clusters'), on the biochemistry of subcellular compartments, or on the biochemical behavior of signaling pathways within entire cells. In most cases, the equations are too complicated to be solved 'on a piece of paper' and are instead used in computer simulations that iteratively 'solve' them for small time steps, to calculate the evolution of the system over biological time periods of seconds to hours or days.",

These insights have prompted numerous theoretical studies focusing on the small-scale spatial aspects of cellular signaling. Stochastic spatiallyresolved simulations (26) explore the early kinetics of signaling processes within small networks of individually interacting proteins and lipids. Many of these approaches utilize Monte Carlo 2 methods (27; 28) to incorporate the random thermal fluctuations governing molecular Brownian motion and reactive encounters. With few exceptions (29; 30) , the molecules are treated as spatially structureless entities and only their approximate radius is (sometimes) taken into account. Studies that aim at elucidating the cooperative behavior of receptor complexes in different states of activation frequently introduce the simplification of assigning those complexes positions on the nodes of spatial grids where only neighboring grid points can influence each other, to make the simulations computationally tractable for large numbers of individual receptors (31) . Such methods do establish a model that corresponds in some degree to data from experimental studies of molecular interactions based on distance-sensitive methods such as FRET (Foerster Resonance Energy Transfer), but the specific geometry of the grid affects the simulation outcome and the chosen geometry may not provide a close approximation of the environment in which the actual molecular interactions occur, limiting the correspondence between model and biological system.",

Reaction-diffusion simulations of large networks of molecules aimed at investigating more than just a few seconds of signaling dynamics have to give up the advantages of particle-based approaches in terms of dynamical detail and conceptual simplicity in favor of the computational efficiency of molecule number-or concentration-based modeling techniques -that is, treatment of the bulk or average behavior of a molecular species rather than of each individual element. Such techniques, if they include spatial aspects, have to divide the relevant cellular space in which the biochemical events are being simulated (cytoplasmic domains, intracellular compartments, or membrane regions) into subvolumes small enough to justify the assumption of local homogenous concentrations, because this assumption underlies all concentration-or particle numberbased simulations. Individual molecular Brownian motion simulated in Monte-Carlo approaches is replaced by the phenomenological concept of diffusion, driven by concentration differences. Instead of strictly localized bimolecular interactions, mass actionbased equations are used to simulate reactions that modify the chemical composition of the modeled system (33) (34) (35) .",

Without having to pay the cost associated with simulating stochastic effects, such simulations can afford to calculate extended concentration time courses for spatial domains comprising entire cells or even groups of cells embedded into representations of extracellular space (36) (37) (38) , provided that the signaling networks are not too complicated. However, for networks that comprise too many interacting components and/or components that have many functional binding sites mediating interactions with other molecules, the resulting systems of equations describing the rates of change of the concentrations in the system may become too large to be simulated with spatial resolution. Examples of signaling networks with great complexity are the pathways downstream of immunoreceptor or EGF receptor ligation. In fact, these pathways may be so complex that differential equation-based approaches trying to simulate kinetics down to the activation of transcription factors face serious problems with regard to just formulating the reaction kinetics in ways that permit communicating the model's assumptions in a human readable format. The problem is simple to understand -if each receptor has multiple sites for phosphorylation (ITAMs and so on), and each phosphorylated site can bind adaptor molecules that in turn recruit kinases or phosphatases subsequently interacting with downstream targets, and if the phosphorylation of each set of sites in the cascade is heterogeneous, then the state of the system is represented by a combinatorial expansion that rapidly grows to enormous numbers. The phenomenon of such combinatorial complexity arising in models with components that have many functional binding sites has been extensively discussed (39; 40) . As an alternative to describing such systems in terms of hundreds or thousands of differential equations, one can in principle describe their properties in terms of functional molecular binding sites and their interactions, just as we did in the previous sentence, and leave the task of unfolding the resulting networks of reactions to the computer simulating their concentration kinetics (36; 41-43) .",

This in turn places two categories of demands on the investigator. The first is to collect the necessary quantitative data to constrain the many parameters used to define the model. One needs to know how many molecules of each species exist in what volume and, preferably, in what state of biochemical modification (phosphorylated or not, ubiquitinylated or not \u2026), their affinities of interaction, the rates of enzymatic transformation, and so on. One also needs a reasonably complete picture of the molecular interactions in the (sub) pathway being modeled. For this reason, a diverse set of high-throughput data acquisition methods is needed to collect the necessary quantitative and organizational data on the components to be included in the model, and much of the remainder of this review is devoted to a discussion of the relevant technologies, their uses, and limitations.",

Many modeling efforts in immunology in particular and biology in general have relied on expert mathematicians and computer scientists to develop equations, computer scripts or code to handle these formal descriptions and conduct the calculations necessary for simulating a model of interest to the biologist studying the question at hand. While such collaborations between theorists and experimental biologists reflect the inherent multi-disciplinary nature of systems biology, they always carry with them the danger of losing in translation important biological aspects of a model. Moreover, complex realistic models of extensive systems, in particular those that cover multiple scales, are often difficult to implement even with expert computational skills. For both of these reasons, substantial effort has been devoted to developing computer software that eases the translation of biological thinking into the equations necessary for quantitative simulations. Some approaches allow the user to define reactions in tabular form or by connecting nodes of a graphically-created network of signaling complexes (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) and to simulate the dynamics of those networks. An even more accessible approach is provided by novel software that performs automated generation of reaction networks from the simple biologist-defined bi-molecular interactions that underlie all reaction systems, input via graphical user interfaces offering iconic representations of molecules and their interactions that aim at resembling classical signaling diagrams (36; 49) and with which the biologist is comfortable. When combined with user-friendly software that also permits developing spatially-resolved computational models of cellular behavior (36; 50), such techniques remove many of the impediments that in the past have prevented experimental biologists from exploring the validity of their hypotheses through quantitative computer simulations. Furthermore, the output in these tools can take the form of graphs and charts that resemble the output of bench experiments, allowing the biologist to easily understand the predictions made by the model and simulation and to relate this output to data that can be derived from new experiments corresponding to the conditions chosen for the computer simulation.",

The ability of lymphocytes to quickly and strongly react to the engagement of even very few immune receptors by pathogen-derived ligands while filtering out the overwhelmingly more frequent ambient stimuli originating from uninfected host tissue has challenged modelers for decades. For T cell activation, the two main unsolved questions are 1) what, from the point of view of the T cell receptor, distinguishes the binding of an agonist peptide-MHC from the binding of a non-agonist ligand and 2) how does the T cell translate this difference in the nature of the primary stimulus into a useful cellular response? The majority of immunologists today believes that agonist stimulation differs from stimulation through non-agonists only with regard to the association and dissociation rates of the interaction between the TCR and the peptide-MHC complex although other concepts have been proposed (51; 52). A higher association rate would mean that agonist peptide-MHCs can trigger TCRs with a higher frequency whereas a lower dissociation rate would give the intercellular TCR-peptide-MHC complex a longer lifetime. If the TCR (or its immediate downstream signaling partners) keep the memory of a previous ligation for a non-negligible amount of time, both types of kinetic advantage of agonists over non-agonists would mean that the TCR is activated over greater periods of time, even between binding events (53) , giving it the opportunity to activate downstream signaling components more effectively. This memory must, however, not last too long since it would otherwise blur the discrimination between the kinetics of agonist and non-agonist binding.",

            "text": "Full phosphorylation of the ITAMs in the TCR-associated \u03b6-chain by Lck is the hallmark of successful TCR activation. For this to occur, the binding of the TCR through peptide-MHC has to (transiently) shift the balance between the activities of the kinases directly or indirectly inducing this phosphorylation and the phosphatases reverting it in favor of the kinases. Many modeling efforts have been directed towards identifying the mechanisms that can achieve this outcome with high sensitivity (in order to allow for responses to low densities of agonist peptide-MHCs [pMHCs] on APCs) while at the same time retaining the capacity seen in real cells of an exquisite ability to distinguish between agonists and nonagonists. To accommodate the latter requirement, the concept of kinetic proofreading through the TCR signaling network was introduced (54) , according to which ligation of the TCR induces a sequence of state transitions that are reverted once the TCR:pMHC bond breaks. Stably bound (or, if the system has memory, rapidly rebinding) ligands (see (55) for a quantitative exploration) would complete the transition sequence to the end point of full TCR activation whereas weak ligands would only lead to progression through part of the sequence before dissociating and causing the signaling system to fall back to its basal state. However, the question of which signaling components and mechanisms can account for this behavior and whether the above-mentioned shift towards higher kinase activity is part of the proofreading has remained controversial. Based on the notion that close contact between T cell and APC membrane surface necessary for the formation of TCR:pMHC complexes would exclude the phosphatase CD45 due to its large bulky extracellular domain (thus limiting dephosphorylation of Lck and the ITAMs in the CD3 and \u03b6-chains), van der Merwe and colleagues suggested that kinetic segregation of kinases and phosphatases could be the mechanism creating (relatively) kinase-rich domains promoting initiation of the proofreading cascade (56) . To support their model these authors performed particle-based Monte Carlo simulations where the particles, representing pMHC and TCR, were confined to movement on the nodes of a 2D spatial grid representing the membranes. The simulations demonstrated that the segregation model can achieve ligand discrimination but did not reproduce the experimentally observed ability of T cells to perform this discrimination within less than a minute as biochemical studies show is the case (18) . In order to reproduce these reported time scales computational models may have to focus on the smallest biochemical scale, the scale of signaling microclusters (57; 58) or even individual TCRs interacting locally with a highly dynamic actin skeleton (59; 60). Such models would require experimental data that combine high-resolution microscopy techniques with careful quantitative analysis of molecular movement and interactions (61) .",

            "text": "Downstream of the immediate receptor-proximal ligand discrimination, T cells engage a complex signaling network, enforcing its cell-wide consequences (activation or adaptation) through various feedback mechanisms. Among these, the competing activation of the phosphatase SHP-1 and the kinase Erk was shown to play an important role (67) . Based on this experimental work, several computational models were developed. Since many of the molecules involved in these networks are cytosolic, most models assume that spatial aspects at this later stage of the cellular response are less important than during its first seconds, in spite of growing evidence that intracellular signaling cascades such as the one activating MAPK involve spatial coordination of molecular interactions with the help of scaffolds (68; 69). Chan et al. (70) used a simple differential equation model to investigate the role of phosphatase/kinase feedbacks and showed how such mechanisms would be able to take advantage of self-(or null-) peptides and could also account for the phenomenon of antagonism. A far more complex model with explicit simulation of many of the molecular interactions downstream of the TCR allowed Altan-Bonnet and Germain (71) to make detailed predictions about the dynamics of SHP-1 and Erk activation that could be tested experimentally. One of the key findings of this work was that the Erk response of single T cells was digital -on or off -in contrast to the more continuous distribution of Erk phosphorylation levels observed in populations of stimulated cells. Using a stochastic simulation based on Gillespie's Monte Carlo algorithm (72) , Chakraborty, Weiss, and colleagues subsequently showed that feedback activation by Ras-GTP of the Ras-specific nucleotide exchange factor SOS (73) can lead to such all-or-nothing cellular responses in the Erk pathway and a filter-like sharp distinction between weak and strong signals coming from the TCR (61) . Although postulated originally for TCR signaling, the concept of kinetic proofreading was subsequently shown to be relevant for B cell receptor ligand discrimination as well and mathematical models were used to explore its limitations and point out the possibility of low affinity ligands escaping this 'quality control' (74) .",

Three main modeling categories on different spatial and biological scales have emerged that treat biological systems in which the cell is the smallest element of function. The first uses mainly differential equation-based, mathematical models to investigate organism-wide cell population dynamics, in particular in response to pathogenic challenges such as viral or bacterial infection. These are typically what can be called 'compartment' models, in which the differential equations report the change over time in the concentration (number) of particular elements (cells, pathogens) in defined organ (spatial) compartments such as lymph node, or liver, or lung, as well as in functional compartments such as 'central memory' vs 'effector' T cells. The second approach -typically focusing on cell population-wide consequences of single cell decisions -explores the balance between cell-autonomous programmatic behavior on one hand and cellular crosstalk on the other hand in the regulation of processes such as cell activation, differentiation, division, or death. The third category takes direct advantage of recent advances in high-resolution in vivo microscopy and of ever-increasing computer power to study how individual cells react to external mechanical and chemical stimuli with the help of image-guided computational models that incorporate aspects of dynamic single-cell morphology.",

The basic idea behind these models is that proliferation and death rates of one species depend on the size of the populations of other species with which it interacts: when there are a lot of rabbits, foxes find enough food to proliferate quickly. When their appetite for rabbits starts causing a reduction of their food source this, in turn, causes a decrease in the proliferation of foxes. The smaller number of foxes then allows the rabbits to recover, starting a new cycle. The transfer to immunology is in principle straightforward -with the interesting twist that in HIV infection the roles of the foxes and the rabbits are not clearly assigned since both (immune cells and virus) are sometimes predator, sometimes prey. In spite of their simplicity, these approaches have contributed much to our understanding of host-pathogen dynamics because of the way they sharpened our intuition with regard to cell population dynamics. Modeling studies of the kinetics of the loss of T cells after SIV/HIV infection (79; 80) and the (only incomplete) recovery following HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) have prompted controversial discussions and led to experiments that moved the field from the concept of increased T cell proliferation after infection as a homeostatic response following direct virus-induced depletion towards a focus on uncontrolled broad immune activation (81; 82) and gradual loss of central memory T cells (83) as the driving force behind the progression to AIDS.",

The experimental inputs for such models typically consist of population sizes (cell counts) of cells of specific types or differentiation states. Since the goal of these studies is to infer relationships between the proliferation, differentiation, and death rates of interdependent cell types from fitting the corresponding parameters of equations describing the change over time of the population sizes, the ideal data consist of longitudinal studies measuring the relevant cell counts at several consecutive time points. However, longitudinal studies are difficult to do with human subjects and expensive with non-human primates. Moreover, the combined effects of proliferation, differentiation, and death are difficult to extract from cell count time series alone because, for instance, a decrease in the size of one population could stem from an increase of death or differentiation (leaving one population and entering another) or reduced proliferation or influx from other populations. Many modeling efforts therefore take advantage of data that report cell proliferation histories in addition to cell counts. Cell labels such as BrdU and CFSE become diluted by a factor of 2 every time a cell divides. Following the fluorescence intensity of such markers in different cell populations thus allows the experimentalist and modeler to distinguish, for instance, between increased proliferation and reduced death (85) (86) (87) (88) . Careful analysis of the time evolution of CFSE intensity profiles in single dividing cell populations has moreover yielded valuable insights about the role played by cell intrinsic variability and its heritability between mother and daughter cells in lymphocyte dynamics (85; 89) .",

Some degree of detail of cellular communication can be incorporated into differential equation models, for instance, by allowing differentiation rates to depend on extracellular concentrations of cytokines and modeling the time course of such concentrations alongside the cell population sizes (90) . However, cytokine and chemokine concentrations may be strongly location dependent just as are cell densities and hence opportunities for direct cell-cell communication will frequently be distributed nonhomogenously in vivo (91), a property of the system that is not captured with ordinary differential equations that are the basis for most such models.",

Since the seminal work of Celada and Seiden who developed their simulator ImmSim to study immune receptor signal-based cellular behavior (93; 94) with bitstring representation for receptor specificities, agent-based modeling in immunology has been used in particular to study phenomena that involve the formation of specific spatial cellular arrangements. Among the classical examples in this category are the formation of germinal centers and the concomitant evolution of B cell receptor affinities (95; 96) , the dynamics of pathogen control through granuloma formation in the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (97) and the maturation of T cells during their migration through the spatially heterogeneous structures of the thymus (98) . Whereas the majority of agent-based approaches neglect the influence of mechanical interactions between cells and constrain the positions of the simulated cells to the nodes of a spatial grid, recent modeling efforts, building on the pioneering work by Graner and Glazier (99) , have begun to incorporate cellular morphological dynamics into simulations. Among many potential applications, the present focus of these new approaches has been to reproduce data from in vivo microscopic observation of the interactions between T-cells and APCs with high fidelity, to permit more accurate estimation of the duration of these interactions and how they are influenced by the stromal networks within lymph nodes (100; 101).",

In many cases, such systems have natural representations as networks. This is obvious for molecular signaling processes. The nodes of the models of such networks represent concentrations or activation states of the different molecular species, whereas the links (or edges) encode interactions and state transitions (think of phosphorylation of a molecular species, for instance). Simulating such models then simply means updating the concentrations (or activation states) according to the interactions (and rates) associated with the links. Some modelers introduce the simplification that the nodes can only be in two states -on or off. Such networks, which have been applied to immunological systems such as in the analysis of TCR activation (102) , are called Boolean networks because the rules for update determine the on-or off state for the next iteration, based on operations that produce 0 or 1 values and take as input logical combinations of 0 and 1 values. For example, a node may switch to on if the neighbor nodes it is linked to are all on (logical AND operation). While such networks obviously have far fewer parameters than the number that must be provided for a simulation of continuous state networks, the lack of graded responses of single nodes seriously limits the possible dynamical modes of such networks and hence, how well they reflect biological reality.",

Knowledge of the entire set of expressed proteins and other molecules (the proteome, glycome, lipidome etc.), as well as the quantitative rules governing their interactions and chemical transformations, of gene activity (the transcriptome) and epigenetic state, and of metabolic state are needed for generation of comprehensive models at any of these scales. However, as already indicated above, the construction of 'complete' models is for the distant future except perhaps in the realm of metabolomics. There is nevertheless still great value in generating models based on less complete data and focused on only a defined aspect of a cell, tissue, or organ that nevertheless seek to understand the properties of an ensemble of elements rather than each component on its own. In pursuit of this goal, an increasing number of large-scale and in some cases global data acquisition technologies have been developed that enable collection of the information necessary to undertake useful model building and simulation. Each technology has its benefits and limitations, and an understanding of these competing aspects of the methodologies is key to devising an effective and reliable approach to a systems analysis at any level of biological resolution. In this section, we summarize these technologies, essential aspects of their proper use, some examples in which they have been applied, and some of their limitations. An understanding of just what tools are presently available, what advances are needed to address deficiencies in the current methods, and when these techniques can be well-employed, is essential for an investigator to develop an effective systems approach to immunological questions of interest.",

As such they are the most well-developed and available methods for generating the 'parts list' of a cell. Transcript profiling using microarray technology has been the most widely used 'omic' technology and has provided significant insights into immunological development, homeostasis, and transcriptional dynamics during the immune response to antigens and to pathogens. However, this method is an incomplete reporter of cell statethere can be a substantial difference between the transcriptome and proteome in a cell (104) (105) (106) ; and immunologists are well acquainted with the existence of stored mRNA that is only translated upon cellular stimulation (107) . Therefore complementary methods are needed to develop an effective model of cellular behavior based on the actual set of expressed proteins, for example. At the same time, transcriptomic technology can provide an extraordinarily useful and extensive, though incomplete, picture of the differentiation state of a cell or tissue and it is a very effective means of monitoring changes in this state induced by exposure to a stimulus. Both fine grained models of cellular biochemistry and coarse-grained models involving tissue and organ function are often built on pathway maps emerging from microarray analysis of transcriptional states and small RNA expression, in some cases linked to genetic mapping of quantitative trait loci in a technique called eQTL mapping (103; 108) . This oldest of the omic-scale nucleic acids methods in now being supplanted by the emergence of next generation sequencing, which promises to revolutionize not only mRNA transcript profiling but also the analysis of genome sequence variation, small RNA expression and function, epigenetic modification and protein-nucleic acid interactions.",

Oligonucleotide arrays have progressed from features with a 3\u2032 bias that were unable to discriminate splice variants to currently available exon-tiling arrays that cover the entire transcript of each gene and provide significant insight to the specific splice variants expressed (111; 112) . Moreover, with the explosion of available whole genome sequences, it has become commonplace to generate arrays specific for multiple organisms, including pathogens (113) , which permits the simultaneous tracking of expression changes in both host and pathogen during an infection. Microarray technology has made a huge contribution to our understanding of the dynamic transcriptome in normal and disease states, and in clinical applications such as cancer cell profiling and disease prognosis, it has shown remarkable predictive capacity. Its ability to identify 'signatures' in samples from patients with acute myeloid and lymphocytic leukemia that correlated with disease outcome was one of the first demonstrations of the power of non-biased large-scale data gathering approaches to provide insight that would have been almost impossible to obtain from more reductionist methods (114) . These initial successes were followed with the clear demonstration that expression profiles could guide therapy, through correlation of signatures with clinical outcomes in many tumors, both solid and hematological (115; 116). The immune system has proven to be particularly accessible in this regard, through analysis of signatures from whole blood, PBMCs, or from specific hematopoietic cell populations. The obvious value of high quality transcript data repositories to biological research has led to numerous efforts to generate comprehensive databases of mRNA expression maps in most experimental model systems. Following characterization of transcriptional responses to pathogens in innate immune cells (117) (118) (119) (120) , analysis of the blood transcriptome of patients has produced comprehensive catalogs of gene changes characteristic of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders (121) (122) (123) (124) (125) (126) and specific responses to viruses (127) (128) (129) (130) , bacteria (131) (132) (133) , and parasites (118; 134) . The ImmGen project is attempting to provide the field with a highly qualified catalog of gene expression in nearly all identified hematopoietic cell types in the 'resting' state and after defined stimulation with ligands such as those engaging TLRs or various cytokine receptors (14) .",

Firstly it is dependent on prior knowledge of a given transcriptome, and is thus limited to organisms with fully sequenced genomes. Secondly, the dependence on nucleic acid hybridization contributes an unavoidable degree of noise in the transcript profile, and a limited dynamic range leading to poor performance in quantifying less abundant transcripts. Some of these drawbacks can be addressed using direct analysis of specific transcripts with quantitative PCR, although this is more limited in the number of genes that can be analyzed in a single experiment. These limitations can be improved by use of microfluidics to parallelize hundreds of reactions in a single assay (135) , multiplexed bead-based assays that permit simultaneous detection of up to 100 transcripts (136) , and the recent development of the 'Nanostring' technology that can directly capture up to 500 different non-amplified mRNA transcripts using a unique molecular barcoding approach (137) . However, at a genome-wide level, all of these technologies will likely be superseded in the coming years by the recent advances in nucleic acid sequencing that will provide not only more comprehensive coverage but more quantitative data suited to using the information gathered not only for qualitative descriptions of cell or tissue state, but for quantitative modeling of changing gene activity correlated with alterations in chromatin state and transcription factor availability in the nucleus.",

While a run on the capillary-based sequencers used for the human genome project could provide approximately 100 reads of 800bp, NGS machines produce shorter reads of 35-400bp but the number of reads can reach 10 7 , thus exceeding 1 gigabase of sequence per run. This has an enormous impact on the potential experimental applications of sequencing approaches. Genome-wide analyses can be undertaken that do not entail sequencing the entire genome, but instead that which is represented as expressed mRNA, modified DNA (e.g., methylated), nucleic acid bound to a specific protein (e.g., a transcription factor), or DNA sensitive to enzymatic degradation (2).",

Mapping each individual read back to a reference genome and counting hits at each site leads to generation of a quantitative distribution of expressed mRNA across the genome. This has a much greater dynamic range than array technology (over 5 orders of magnitude), permitting more effective identification of low abundance transcripts and it essentially eliminates the background noise associated with hybridization. It is also less prone to variation between research groups using different array platforms, although it is not without its drawbacks. Data storage requirements are significant, and considerable bioinformatic resources are needed to manage the data and deal with alignment challenges such as those associated with repetitive elements (141) .

This global method is ideal for developing gene regulatory network maps for model building, including models that link intracellular biochemical changes induced by extracellular stimuli to changes in gene expression. In ChIP, an antibody recognizing a specific protein (such as RNA polymerase, a sequence-specific transcription factor, or a modified histone) is used to affinity-purify the protein chemically cross-linked to its associated nucleic acid, which is then separated from the conjugated protein and subject to deep sequencing (142) . In the case of RNA pol II-based ChIP-seq, this provides a dynamic complement to RNA-seq as it identifies those genes being actively transcribed under specific experimental conditions, and this can be taken a step further by sequencing ribosome-protected mRNA to provide a quantitative measure of translation. Similarly, applications of ChIP-seq with transcriptional regulatory elements and chromatin-associated proteins are becoming commonplace and promise to revolutionize our understanding of how transcription factor binding and epigenetic modifications control gene expression on a system-wide level (143; 144) .",

The analysis of genomes of patients for common genetic polymorphisms that correlate with specific traits, such as complex or multifactorial disease, has until now been done by profiling of several hundred thousand SNPs using array or bead-based technology (145) . Ultimately, NGS will increase SNP coverage significantly beyond these most common markers, and efforts such the 1000 Genomes Project promise to expand significantly our knowledge of human genomic variation and disease linkage (146). However, most complex diseases cannot be explained by a single gene mutation, and are instead caused by multiple complex factors. Combined analysis of transcript profiles with genetic variation has shown that gene expression can be significantly influenced by polymorphisms in regulatory elements. Such quantitative traits based on statistically significant changes in transcript abundance have been termed expression QTLs (eQTLs; (103; 108)). Although accelerated data generation by NGS and even newer sequencing technologies will make this an area of rapid progress in the next few years, existing eQTL maps will need to move beyond the use of EBV-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines to more relevant tissue-specific sources (147) . Also eQTL mapping can only take us so far, and will require integration of meta data, such as analysis of regulatory small RNAs and protein modification of regulatory factors, to permit a more comprehensive interpretation of the consequences of genetic sequence variation in disease susceptibility.",

As such, they are key elements in attempts to build comprehensive models that link signaling to change of cell state, and because they often target transcription factors, to gene expression. The cellular processes engaged during siRNA-mediated gene knockdown are part of the endogenous pathway for processing of miRNAs, which are initially expressed as pol II-based primary transcripts of several hundred nucleotides. Processing by the ribonucleases Drosha and Dicer produces a mature miRNA, a dsRNA duplex of 20-23nt, which binds to cognate target mRNAs, primarily within their 3\u2032UTR, through a 6-8nt 'seed' sequence towards the 5\u2032end of the mature miRNA leading strand. This leads to a reduction in protein expression, usually through a combination of mRNA destabilization and translational repression (150) . Several hundred miRNA genes have been identified, and many have been classified into families based on seed sequence homology. Although this would suggest overlap in target mRNAs and some degree of functional redundancy, experimental evidence suggests a significant amount of (still poorly understood) functional specificity among family members. Attempts to model the changing expression of molecules (in particular proteins) in a cell in response to extracellular stimuli will require integration of methods such as those detailed above for tracking protein-encoding transcripts with information on the post-transcriptional regulation of translation by miRNAs, along with proteomic methods for direct assessment of the translation products, as discussed in a subsequent section.",

This has led to the rapid generation of miRNA expression profiles across cell types in normal and disease states (151) . Similarly, analysis of the function of specific miRNAs has been facilitated by the development of antisense-based inhibitors ('antagomirs') and chemically synthesized miRNA mimics (152; 153) . Since these reagents are small RNAs themselves, they can be transfected into cells using the same delivery protocols as for siRNA, and many screening groups now routinely add these reagents targeting all known miRNAs to their siRNA screening pipelines to provide a more direct means to identifying the miRNAs influencing the cellular process under study. The advantage with this approach is that it can identify miRNAs important for maintaining a cellular state that do not necessarily change their expression level between experimental conditions (and thus would not be picked up by profiling studies).",

Based primarily on the analysis of miRNA conservation across species and the conservation of seed sequences among orthologous 3\u2032UTRs, target prediction algorithms based on seed matching have improved their predictive accuracy and have reduced their false prediction rate to less than 25% (150) . However, these algorithms still have a significant false negative rate as the influence of sequence context beyond the seed match, both in the miRNA and the target mRNA, is poorly understood. Thus, experimental approaches to the identification of miRNA targets are in need of further development. Immunoprecipitation of the protein components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC-IP), followed by array deep sequencing analysis to identify the miRNA-bound mRNA holds significant promise, but has yet to be applied to large-scale studies (154) . The coupling of mRNA profiling (by microarray or RNA-seq) with quantitative proteomics under conditions of differential miRNA expression is another approach to target identification, and the feasibility of this method has been demonstrated in two recently published studies (155; 156) . These approaches are vital to determine the scope of action of individual miRNAs and to infer the functional consequence of their altered expression on a broader scale.",

            "text": "Certain characteristics of miRNA function are emerging. A single site miRNA/mRNA interaction rarely leads to a >50% reduction in expression, and more commonly averages around 30%. Ninety percent of conserved interactions are single site, although most mRNAs have at least one further site for a different miRNA that can promote further repression. Since a 50% change in expression of a protein may not result in a marked phenotype, as evidenced by the rarity of haploinsufficient mutants, this might explain why very few phenotypes have been observed in systematic screens for miRNA mutants, although some important immunological exceptions to this view have recently emerged in cases where single miRNAs target multiple key signaling molecules (reviewed in (149) ). The degree of influence of a miRNA on a given process may also be exaggerated in laboratory settings by the fact that the described technologies for modulating miRNA expression can lead to more dramatic alterations than occur physiologically. Laboratory conditions are likely more favorable to maintaining the stability of mutant phenotypes, but conditions that better simulate the environment that shaped evolution may be more suited to uncovering the importance of miRNAs in regulating the proteome. This brings us to the question of the mechanism by which miRNAs influence mammalian cell function. It has been proposed that rather than promoting large changes in the expression of a few proteins, they function on a broader scale to 'tune' the proteome. The high degree of conservation of miRNA target sites, and the selective avoidance of seed sequences in the 3\u2032UTRs of mRNA that are coexpressed with a given miRNA suggests that precise control of protein concentration has significant implications for organismal 'fitness'. Such subtle changes in protein concentrations may sensitize regulatory networks. These consideration re-emphasize the point made above that miRNAs and their activities are crucial to development of informative models relating stimulus to response, because network properties clearly involve not only the protein interactome we more typically map and whose component modifications we routinely consider, but also the influence of temporally changing miRNA expression on the balance of protein components within such networks.",

For example, several key signaling components involved in the response of monocytic cells to bacterial endotoxin, such as IRAK1 and TRAF6, are targets for miR146 (157) , while phosphatases shown to downregulate signaling through the T cell receptor (SHP2, PTPN22, DUSP5 and DUSP6) are targets for miR181 (158) . Since these targets have a coherent influence on signal flow through the pathway (i.e., either activating or inhibiting the process), these findings suggest that these miRNAs, which have both been shown to change expression in response to cellular stimulation, act as negative or positive feedback regulators. This is consistent with their tuning function, where they can adjust thresholds for activation under various conditions. They may also have key roles in mediating crosstalk between inflammatory mediators, as evidenced by recent data suggesting the anti-inflammatory effects of IL-10 are promoted through direct inhibition of LPS-induced miR155 expression (159) These observations emphasize the importance of developing quantitative models to predict accurately the influence of miRNA expression changes on cellular function.",

Establishing such connections has traditionally been the realm of genetic screens in mutant cell lines or organisms. Such studies have contributed significantly to the identification of specific elements that play a role in signaling or metabolic pathways, maintain cellular homeostasis, regulate cell structure, intracellular transport, and capacity for migration, modify gene expression, and in other ways contribute to normal physiology, or, when abnormal in form or amount, give rise to disease. Genetic assessments of this type have been especially valuable in model organisms such as Drosophila where common phenotypes were often found to be caused by genes acting in a single linked signaling pathway, associated with recognizable organelles or structural elements of the cell, or comprising a linked gene regulatory pathway (160) . However, this approach tends to identify genes contributing to core functionality conserved across species rather than the components and mechanisms responsible for the subtleties of cell-type specificity and context-dependent cellular function. Thus, our understanding of pathways remains incomplete, and discovery of unknown pathway components has been hampered by canonical bias in experimental design and reagent availability (161) . Non-biased approaches are therefore vital to fill in the gaps in networks to provide a more complete framework upon which we can base predictive models, while at the same time pruning the large parts lists generated by global methods of components unlinked to a direct test of functional relevance.",

As a research tool, RNAi takes advantage of endogenous RNA processing machinery, which permits the silencing of mRNA transcripts with small complementary dsRNA sequences. In C. elegans and Drosophila, this can be achieved through introduction of relatively long pieces of gene specific dsRNA (>100nt); however as this would induce an interferon response in mammalian cells, the gene-specific dsRNA must not exceed 21nt and is thus introduced as short interfering RNA (siRNA; (163) ). siRNA transfection is the simplest and most direct application of RNAi in mammalian cells; however, in less tractable cell types and in cases where longer term silencing is desirable, the siRNA sequence can be expressed from plasmid or viral vectors as a short hairpin RNA (shRNA). This works especially well when the shRNA is designed to mimic an endogenous primary miRNA transcript, with the region that is processed to the mature miRNA replaced with gene-specific targeting sequence (164) .",

This permits a straightforward correlation of phenotype to target, but it has the drawback that the time and expense required for a genome-wide screen is significant. An alternative approach that can be used with virallyexpressed shRNAs is the pooled screen, where large populations of cells are transduced with complex mixtures of viruses expressing shRNAs against all genes. Clonally isolated cells showing the desired phenotype can then be sequenced to determine which shRNA they encode. If the output assay can be designed to select for a cell growth or survival phenotype, a more efficient means to identify hits is to use unique nucleic acid 'barcodes' within each shRNA vector that can be screened for enrichment or depletion by either microarray or sequencing technology. Such pooled screens are powerful, especially for applications in human primary cells of limited availability, but it remains difficult to ensure full genome coverage. These pooled shRNA methods have been productively applied to analysis of the signaling pathways involved in growth and viability of human B cell lymphomas, as one example (166) (167) (168) .",

Achieving satisfactory levels of gene knockdown remains a major technical hurdle in assay development and often forces researchers to choose a non-physiological cell type for the process they are studying, bringing up the concern that the physiological relevance of hits identified in a highly transfectable cell line may be questionable. In some cases, optimal transfection conditions can be identified in more physiological cell lines if an efficient and relatively high throughput knockdown assay [such as the targeting of a stably-expressed reporter gene (169) ] can be developed that permits in investigator to assess rapidly and conveniently a wide range of transfection parameters and reagents.",

It can be extremely laborious, requiring attention to detail and continual assay repetition with minor alterations to optimize performance; however careful development of a robust assay pays off in the quality and discovery potential of the screening results. There are several considerations in choosing and designing a screening assay, such as whether the readout should be endpoint or timeresolved, single feature or multiplex, and whether data should be collected from populations or single cells. In each of these cases, the latter option would clearly produce a richer dataset, however the value of the type of data collected is often inversely proportional to the ease of assay design and implementation. Thus, a compromise has to be reached taking into consideration the overall logistics of running the screen, the cost, and the researcher's expectations from the data. Most of the initially published genome-wide screens used relatively simple assays, such as cell lethality, and to a certain degree the goal was primarily to establish a proof of principle for the RNAi technology. Screens using more complex assays and readouts are now being published, but there remain relatively few examples in the literature of screens using live cells, multiplexed readouts, or single cell-based data collection.",

High content assays involve the collection of multiple functional parameters of cell state such as cell shape, location of structural markers and organelles, signaling response readouts and/or gene expression changes, often by use of multiple spectrally distinct fluorescent reporters. This opens up the possibility of tracking multiple readouts in a biological process in single cells over an extended time course. This approach, though clearly powerful, poses numerous technical challenges and published reports of screens with multiple assay readouts have, until recently, been limited to sub-genome scale efforts. Three recent reports have combined a mammalian genome-wide siRNA screen with multi-parametric image analysis. Zerial and colleagues studied the endocytosis and trafficking of either a recycling (transferrin) or late endosome/lysosome cargo (EGF receptor) in HeLa cells co-stained with nuclear and cytosolic markers (170) . They identified hits enriched in specific pathways such as Wnt, TGFb and Notch, and a Bayesian network analysis led them to predict that numerous kinetic and spatial aspects of endocytosis are highly regulated. Ellenberg and colleagues used a live cell assay to profile cell division parameters in HeLa cells expressing GFP-labeled histone 2B (171) . They used an siRNA microarray approach which involves plating cells in chambers with up to 384 siRNA, which has the advantage of standardizing cell culture conditions across the array (172) . Although they collected data from only a single fluorescent channel, they were able to classify up to 16 morphological phenotypic characteristics based on the shape of the labeled nuclei, and their data analysis identified numerous genes involved in cell division and migration. Boutros and colleagues assessed the effect of siRNA transfection in HeLa cells co-stained for DNA and the cytoskeletal proteins actin and tubulin (173) . Clustering of gene perturbations by phenotypic similarity allowed the identification of novel players in the DNA damage response. Use of multi-readout, highcontent screening assays brings up additional challenges in the development of assay controls, which are vital to screening success. In addition to low-noise negative controls, it is desirable to identify multiple positive control siRNAs that provide a graded perturbation of the selected assay readout. If only strong positive controls are selected, evaluation of screen quality is biased and partial phenotypes of biological interest will likely be missed. Of course in a multiplex assay with data collected over time, the comparative strength of controls for different readouts will vary, which in itself can provide new biological insight prior to the screen. Ultimately, the more comprehensive the group of positive controls identified during development of the screening assay, the more valuable the control data will be during data analysis.",

While 0.5 is considered a minimum for a good chemical screening assay, recent data suggest that this is overly stringent for RNAi screens, which are inherently more noisy, and Z\u2032 factors of >0 are considered acceptable (174) . The comparatively higher noise in RNAi screen can be attributed to several factors; potential 'off-target' effects (discussed below), longer (48-72hr) siRNA incubation times required to achieve target knockdown, cell stress from the transfection procedure and the fact that, in contrast to a chemical library, every reagent in the RNAi library has a cellular target and thus a potential impact on cellular behavior.",

These screens benefit greatly from experimental automation and robotic workflows, which up until recently had been restricted primarily to groups in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. A significant resource for RNAi screeners has been the recent establishment of small molecule screening infrastructure in the academic and government sectors (175) , such that at many research sites, the expansion of these facilities into RNAi screening has been a natural progression. Prior high-throughput standard operating procedures for screening have thus already established the importance of detailed scheduling and tracking of day-to-day workflow, to permit correlation of data irregularities with procedural variations in screen execution. The importance of recording key screen parameters to allow comparison of RNAi screening datasets between different laboratories is also emphasized by an ongoing effort to establish community standards for the minimal information that should be recorded from an RNAi screening experiment (http://miare.sourceforge.net/HomePage).",

As mentioned above, RNAi screens have a degree of inherent noise, as their nucleic acid base-pairing dependent mechanism will always suffer from a degree of non-specificity. So called 'off-target' effects can occur due to the hybridization of an siRNA to a non-intended target, especially within the 'seed' sequence, the first 8nt from the 5\u2032 end of the siRNA leading strand (176) . Although this has been addressed by improvements in sequence selection algorithms to increase siRNA specificity and chemical modifications of the siRNA duplex to limit interference by the siRNA passenger strand, it will remain a factor to consider (177) . For practical reasons, primary genome-wide arrayed screens often use a pool of several siRNA reagents in the same well. To address the issue of whether hits in primary screen are due to an off-target effect from one of the siRNAs in the pool, it is common practice to re-screen the primary hits with the individual siRNAs from each scoring pool. Cases where only one of the siRNAs from the pool reproduces the phenotype are considered likely off-target hits and are dropped from further analysis. Another similar approach is to re-screen hits with alternative siRNAs from another source. Incremental improvements in the efficacy and specificity of genome-wide siRNA libraries should in time provide reagents that reliably diminish all genes in mammalian cells, with enough reagents available per gene to permit effective filtering of 'off-target' phenotypes during the analysis process.",

Briefly, the analysis process follows a series of keys steps: 1) Data triage and pre-processing, carried out during and/or immediately after completion of the screen to identify any unexpected patterns in the data that might indicate experimental or procedural issues; 2) Normalization, usually carried out within each plate to remove systematic errors caused by day-to-day experimental drift over the period of time required to complete the screen; 3) Calculation of quality metrics, such as Z or Z\u2032 factor, to evaluate assay reproducibility and consistency of controls; 4) Hit identification. The most popular method of hit identification is mean +/\u2212 k standard deviation, which sets a threshold of deviation from the normalized mean beyond which a gene is considered a hit. This is satisfactory for normally distributed data, but it performs poorly in assays prone to outliers, where methods such as median +/\u2212 k median absolute deviation are more appropriate. Many of these data analysis steps can be carried out within freely available software packages appropriate for RNAi screens (178) (179) (180) .",

A better approach may be the relative weighting of all genes' phenotypic contribution such as in a gene vs. phenotype relationship, which is less likely to miss weak but biologically meaningful hits (160) . For practical purposes, a subset of genes may have to be chosen for follow up through secondary screens, but the importance of retention of all the data in a queryable database will be vital to future integrative analysis.

It has been common to use relatively subjective criteria to generate smaller lists of genes for secondary screens, although some recent studies have demonstrated that a welldesigned primary screen with alternative selection criteria can generate a higher confidence list of primary hits (181) . As discussed above, re-screening with deconvoluted siRNA pools and alternate sources of silencing reagents has been shown to be an excellent first step in the hit validation process. Another method that is impractical at a genome-wide scale but possible in secondary screening is to measure the extent of transcript depletion (or even better, protein expression loss) with each siRNA and then determine the correlation of knockdown with phenotype. Though expensive, transcript/protein profiling with multiple siRNAs per gene can also help validate hits or identify unexpected altered gene clusters that may contribute to off-target phenotypes. Rescue of a phenotype by ectopic expression of an RNAi resistant version of a target gene is considered the ultimate validation strategy, however this remains difficult to implement in a practical manner for a large number of genes (162) .",

Since insect cells do not have an interferon response upon challenge with dsRNA, a long sequence of dsRNA complementary to the target gene can be introduced into cells and processing of this nucleic acid by the RNAi pathway produces a complex mixture of siRNAs that leads to robust target gene depletion. Drosophila siRNA screens have identified several of the signaling components involved in the fly systemic response to infection through the Toll, IMD and Jak/STAT pathways, and screens with live bacteria and viruses have identified specific host factors that, in some cases, are conserved in mammalian cells (reviewed in (182)).

This analysis initially compared all 1254 human genes identified in the genome-wide surveys to the 1434 genes in the NCBI HIV interaction database, and found that the overlap of 257 genes had a high degree of statistical significance. Network enrichment analysis of the functional categories over-represented in this gene set highlighted several gene ontology groups as being most important for HIV entry and replication, including nuclear pore/transport, GTPbinding proteins, protein complex assembly, intracellular transport, proteasome function, and RNA splicing. A closer analysis of the three siRNA screens found that of the 34 genes identified as HIV host factors in at least 2 screens, 29 were expressed in CD4+ cells and/or tissue, and thus would have the opportunity to influence the host response to virus in these key HIV target cells. Of the 8 genes in this set considered 'druggable', two proteins, CXCR4 and Akt1, are already targeted in established HIV treatment regimens, supporting the drug discovery potential of these screening approaches.",

Of the 1449 genes identified in the published influenza screens, 128 were identified by at least two screens. Interestingly, the highest degree of pairwise overlap was observed between the Konig and Karlas screens, which used the same A549 epithelial cell line and variants of the WSN/H1N1 virus, supporting the likelihood that differences in experimental approach have a significant influence on hit correlation between independent studies. Combination of the screen hits with interaction data between flu and host proteins was used to generate a 'hostvirus network' which showed enrichment for primary cellular processes required for the viral life cycle; endocytosis, nuclear transport, transcription/translation and viral assembly and budding. However, many of the genes highlighted by this type of analysis are likely to be poor drug targets as they are necessary for fundamental cellular processes. Selection of genes linked to cellular processes known to be important for the influenza viral life cycle may be less fruitful than taking a more non-biased approach to the screening data. For example, greater insight might be gained by combining the unfiltered siRNA datasets with genetic variation data to look for correlation between screen hits and polymorphisms linked to infection susceptibility.",

RNAi screening led to the discovery of several molecules involved in the process of store-operated Ca2+ influx through plasma membrane CRAC channels and the subsequent activation of the transcription factor NFAT, which are fundamental to lymphocyte activation and function. Examples include the CRAC pore-forming protein Orai (185) (186) (187) , the ER Ca2+ depletion sensor Stim (188; 189), and NFAT regulators such as NRON and the Dyrk family kinases (190; 191) . RNAi has demonstrated a specific role for Akt1 in the regulation of intracellular bacterial growth (192) , a screen for T cell inhibitory molecules in Hodgkin's lymphoma identified the immunoregulatory glycan-binding protein Galectin-1 as a key factor in promoting immune privilege for neoplastic Reed Sternberg cells (193) , and screens using virally-expressed shRNAs in less tractable immune cell types have identified an unexpected reliance of multiple myeloma cells on the transcription factor IRF4 (194) , as well as providing significant insight to chronic antigen receptor signaling and the aberrant activation of NFkB in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (166) (167) (168) . Further recent discoveries using RNAi include demonstration of key roles for the kinase RIP3 in programmed necrosis following viral inflammation and AIM2 in sensing of cytoplasmic DNA (195) (196) . These examples highlight the potential of RNAi screening technology both in the discovery of individual proteins with essential functions in immune responses, and also the broader characterization of the cellular and organismal response to pathogenic challenge.",

Although interactions among molecules of diverse chemical composition are important (for example, proteins with lipids or carbohydrates), at present, most efforts are devoted to initially producing a comprehensive view of the protein interactome. There are three principal methods in use for the cataloging of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) remains the most practical high-throughput method for generation of interactome data, affinity purification of protein complexes followed by mass spectrometry (AP/MS) is the preferred approach for the characterization of multi-protein complexes, while protein complementation assays (PCA) are emerging as a means to measure interactions in a better preserved cellular context, with important applications for assessing real-time PPI dynamics (for reviews see (197) (198) (199) ). While none of these methods stand alone as an optimal approach, together they have the potential to generate a comprehensive knowledge base in the emerging field of 'interactomics'. In time, they will arguably generate a higher confidence (and certainly a more complete) dataset than literature curation, which has its own significant drawbacks, such as subjective interpretation of data quality, narrow focus on canonical pathway components, experimental variability between laboratories, and non-standard nomenclature across the published literature. Although most scientists tend to attribute higher intrinsic quality to the low-throughput experimental data that populate literature-curated databases, recent analyses suggest that the overlap between the most widely used databases is surprisingly low, and remarkably, >85% of the interactions are supported by only a single publication (200) . A noteworthy advantage of literature curation is that biological function can often be inferred directly from the curated study; however, this 'study bias' can also hamper novel biological insight. Data-driven high throughput PPI approaches, although lacking a direct link to a biological question, usually avoid study bias, their systematic methodology can reduce inter experiment variability, and since negative data can also be collected, they permit an estimation of interactome coverage. Thus, although the total number of expressed genes between Drosophila, C. elegans and human is not significantly different, the respective interactomes have been estimated at 65K, 200K, and 650K, respectively (201) , and may therefore provide a more meaningful barometer for organismal complexity.",

Interaction of a bait-prey '2-hybrid' is then detected through expression of a reporter gene driven by a promoter responsive to the chosen reconstituted transcription factor. The original lacZ-based colorometric identification of interactions remains a popular reporter in Y2H assays, but for large-scale screening, protocols have evolved to incorporate some method of positive selection such that only cells hosting an interaction can survive in selective media (203) . Examples of positive selection reporters include HIS3 and URA3, which permit growth in histidine-or uracil-lacking media, respectively. Use of these latter reporters can also be combined with competitive inhibitors and additional reagents that allow screeners to titrate for interaction strength or convert the reporter to negative selection to identify inhibitors of a given interaction.",

Improvement of Y2H screening efficiency is thus a continuing challenge, but may be attained with developments in accessory techniques, such as NGS for improved clone sequencing throughput. The filtering of false positives is another important aspect of Y2H data validation. Technical validation of whether an identified interaction can occur can be addressed with orthogonal technologies, such as affinity purification of the two proteins in a complex from cells. However, whether an interaction actually does occur with a function role in the organism is more difficult to address.

            "text": "technology can address some of the deficiencies of Y2H as it involves the immunoprecipitation of a protein complex in a semi-native state followed by the MS-based identification of the complex constituents (see below). This is usually achieved by expressing the bait protein of interest with an affinity tag that can be recognized by a specific antibody to permit isolation of the bait in complex with associated proteins. Initial studies with simple affinity tags were prone to false negatives due to the stringent wash conditions required for effective bait purification. The development of tandem affinity purification (TAP) tags has addressed this by using a protease cleavable tag sequence with two affinity tags (such as protein A and a calmodulinbinding peptide). Two rounds of affinity purification with different tags significantly reduces non-specific binding and permits the use of less stringent purification conditions in each step, which has been shown to be more sensitive in identifying lower affinity interactions (197) . One technical drawback is that the bait protein often must be heterologously expressed to introduce the affinity tag, and it is difficult to ensure that the expression level of the tagged protein is comparable to the endogenous untagged form. In yeast, this can be addressed by using homologous recombination at the native locus, and accordingly, genome-wide yeast strains have been generated expressing an affinity tagged version of every gene for AP/MS studies (212; 213) . A similar resource for mammalian cells is some way off, but a technique has been developed using 'BAC transgenomics', which permits the tagging of mammalian genes at their native locus within a bacterial artificial chromosome construct, which is then stably transduced into a cell line allowing the tagged gene to be expressed from its native promoter (214) . Generation of BAC libraries tagging all human and mouse genes in this manner would provide an invaluable resource for systematic interaction analysis and the potential of this approach is emphasized in a recent study of mitotic interaction complexes in human cells (215) .",

Some excellent focused studies have been carried out on specific modules known to have key roles in normal and disease states, such as the TGF\u03b2 (216) and TNF\u03b1/NFkB (217) subnetworks and these studies have highlighted the ability of affinity purification strategies to identify the dynamic interactions involved in signal relay through such subnetworks.

This is the most physiological of the described technologies as interactions can be detected in the cell that normally expresses the protein of interest, with post-translational modifications intact and without the problems associated with the affinity demands of the TAP method. However, like Y2H, the approach is best suited to the detection of directly interacting proteins, whereas TAP can identify molecular machines composed of multiple elements without the need for the tagged elements to directly interact with each of these other components. PCAs use a similar bait-prey premise as Y2H (hence the alternative 'mammalian 2-hybrid' nomenclature), but the tags expressed on the proteins represent two domains of an enzymatic or fluorescent reporter, which provides a signal only when a detected PPI brings the domains into sufficiently close proximity. Examples of reporters include DHFR, \u03b2-lactamase, and GFP (198) . A recent analysis of interactions between >5K yeast ORFs by this method suggested that the confidence scores within the interaction data were improved over the other two technologies, with better enrichment of compartment-specific interactions that might be inaccessible to Y2H and AP/MS (219).",

Our knowledge of immune cell signaling, particularly in cells of the innate immune system, has been informed to a considerable extent by the mechanisms used by pathogens, especially those with type III secretion systems, to disrupt key signaling pathways and establish infection. Since pathogens often express relatively few proteins for direct interaction with the host proteome, global screens to determine host protein binding partners for pathogenic proteins have been and will continue to be highly informative in efforts to develop models of host-pathogen interactions. Since viruses are dependent on interactions within host cells for their survival and pathogenicity, elucidation of virus-host interactomes as well as intraviral interactions are of particular interest. Again, due to its amenability to high-throughput studies, Y2H has been employed much more than the other techniques described above. Intraviral Y2H screens have been carried out for numerous viruses, especially herpesviruses (VZV, KSHV, HSV-1, mCMV and EBV) due to their larger genomes providing more ORFs (70 to 170) for screening (220) (221) (222) (223) . Analysis of the intraviral network in this family has suggested a high degree of conservation of core interactions that support the viral life cycle, such as the involvement of the HSV-1 UL33, UL31 and UL34 orthologs across all herpesviruses (regardless of sequence conservation) in capsid envelopment and nuclear egress (224) .",

At the roots of this discrepancy lie the natural properties of nucleic acids and proteins. The physicochemical properties of nucleic acids permit their recognition and replication by complementary base pairing, which provides the means of expanding the amount of material in hand from rare sources; DNA is also a relatively stable molecule and RNA can often be converted into DNA for experimental manipulation. In contrast, no widely useful method exists for amplifying proteins from cellular sources. Furthermore, although the folded structure of a protein is inherent in its primary sequence, protein function depends more on tertiary structure and especially on numerous post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, as compared with nucleic acid products of the cell (although we are beginning to appreciate how RNA folding and not just sequence contribute greatly to the performance of this class of biomolecules and DNA methylation is certainly an important post-synthetic modification). Because proteins cannot be amplified in a way resembling PCR for nucleic acids, methods for measurements of proteins and their properties rely either on very precise, sensitive physical measurements (mass spectrometry) or on signal amplification with antibodies (ELISA-based assays, protein microarrays, flow cytometry, confocal imaging). Proteomic and protein chemical studies are essential in developing quantitative models because they report on the actual molecular constituents of the cell, not just on the coding potential that is determined using transcriptomic methods, because they provide information on the biochemical state of the proteins and not just their existence, and because they can be used to quantify the number of protein molecules in a cellular compartment and hence, their effective concentrations. They can also ascertain the association/dissociation rates for molecular pairs and higher order complexes, and provide information on catalytic rates. These latter parameters are critical for fine-grained modeling of such systems as signaling networks. Some of the same methods used for proteomic studies are also the basis for other large-scale study of biomolecules in cells and fluids, especially mass spectrometry, which is a primary tool for metabolomic and lipidomic investigations.",

Therefore, a mass spectrometer must contain an ion source for conversion of the sample into gas phase ions, a mass analyzer for the separation of ions based on the m/z, and a detector measuring the number of ions in the sample (usually with amplification, since the number of ions passing through the instrument is quite small). Initially, mass spectrometry was developed for small molecules, and the methods and instrumentation for small molecule analysis are still in wide use. More recently, however, protein analysis using mass spectrometry has been markedly enhanced by the development of soft ionization techniques, such as electrospray ionization (ESI) (229), used for ionization of liquid samples, and matrix-assisted laser desorptionionization (MALDI) (230) , used for ionization of solid samples bound to specific matrices.",

Mass analyzers sort the ions based on the m/z by applying electromagnetic fields, but the details of their construction and applied physics can vary, leading to differences in performance. The most commonly used mass analyzers for protein analysis are quadrupoles (Q), ion traps (quadrupole/threedimensional, QIT, or linear, LTQ), time-of-flight (TOF), and Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) devices (an excellent summary of the properties of different types of mass spectrometers can be found in (231)). Protein identification is usually achieved by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), in which the m/z ratios of peptides derived from enzymatic (usually tryptic) digestion of the proteins in the source sample are determined in the MS mode by the first stage spectrometer, and then peptides corresponding to particular m/z ratios are sequenced after energetic fragmentation. The spectrum determination of the fragmented peptides is performed by an additional mass analyzer (the second 'MS' in the name of this method). Therefore, many of the instruments used in proteomics are hybrids combining different types of mass analyzers, for example triple quadrupole, quadrupole/time-of-flight, or quadrupole/ion trap. The selection of the instrument for an experiment depends strongly on the application, which for proteomic studies falls primarily into three groups: determination of protein expression levels (globally and in specific cellular compartments), identification and quantification of post-translational modifications, and characterization of protein-protein interactions. Recently, a new type of mass analyzer, called the Orbitrap, has been developed (232) and implemented in a hybrid instrument with a linear ion trap and a C-trap (233) . Its superior sensitivity, accuracy and resolution (234) , combined with MS/MS capability and robustness, makes the LTQ-Orbitrap ideal for high sensitivity, high-throughput peptide analysis (235) and these properties have quickly made it an instrument of choice for many proteomic studies (236) (237) (238) .",

            "text": "The fragmentation method used for sequencing depends on the application. The most popular fragmentation method, collision-induced dissociation (CID), is effective for protein identification. The peptide ions in the gas phase are allowed to collide with molecules of a neutral gas (for example, helium or argon). The collision causes bond breakage in the peptide and causes the fragmentation of the peptide ion into shorter fragment ions. By analyzing the m/z ratios of the entire set of fragments from a given peptide, it is possible to deduce the amino acid sequence due to the characteristic masses of individual amino acids, the loss of which during fragmentation at different positions leads to a ladder of fragment masses based on the identity and position of each amino acid in the peptide. Although some amino acids have the same mass, the derived sequence can be matched to a protein sequence data base and many such ambiguities are resolved by this informatics alignment process. This is not always the case, however, and hence, multiple peptides from a single protein are usually needed for unambiguous identification of the parent molecule. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of the side chains of the amino acids also can complicate the sequence calling but the characteristic masses of such modifications can also be used to identify these sites within a protein. Labile PTMs, such as serine and threonine phosphorylation, require lower energy to dissociate them from the peptide than the energy needed to break the peptide bond. Therefore, when CID is used, the phosphate groups are removed leaving the peptide intact and not identified. The peptides with PTMs can be effectively analyzed with use of electron capture dissociation (ECD), using free electrons (239) and, especially, electron transfer dissociation (ETD), using radicals such as anthracene, to cleave the peptide backbone leaving the PTMs intact (240) . C-trap dissociation (HCD), using much higher voltages to create fragment ions, has been developed for the LTQ-Orbitrap and resulted in the improved identification of small (100-200 Daltons) fragment ions. This fragmentation method is particularly effective combined with CID in achieving both good relative quantification with chemical tags (see below) and accurate peptide sequence identification (241) .",

Of the entire set of peptides injected into the instrument at any moment, only three to five of the most abundant ions detected in this short period of scan time are chosen for fragmentation and therefore identified. To enable more distinct peptides to be identified, ions of high intensity present in several consecutive spectra can be automatically excluded in subsequent scans and the next most abundant ions sequenced. However, this exclusion approach does not assure that all the peptides present as ion peaks in the MS spectra will be sequenced, and therefore many peptides present in the sample remain unidentified. This sampling issue is a major problem in mass spectrometry, especially of such samples as serum in which albumin and immunoglobulins are present at orders of magnitude greater concentrations than other elements of interest such as cytokines or shed surface proteins that might serve as biomarkers. Without depletion of the predominant species or extensive fractionation, nearly all the major peptides in each spectra will derive from the predominant species and be resequenced, preventing identification of the rarer entities. Even with efforts to enrich for rare species, it is often the case that the repeat analysis of the same sample will yield different results for overall content, simply due to incomplete sampling in each run. For protein phosphorylation measurements, a situation in which the species of interest can be rare indeed relative to the overall concentration of the parent molecule or other components in the sample, enrichment methods, such as precipitation with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies or utilizing phosphopeptide affinity to metals and metal oxides (Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography, IMAC, and Metal Oxide Affinity Chromatography, MOAC) have been developed, permitting isolation of phosphopeptides from more abundant non-phosphorylated peptides in the sample. Enrichment methods of this type are also typically coupled with high performance liquid chromatography for further separation of the peptides directly prior to injection into the mass spectrometer. Twodimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), or chromatographic methods such as strong cation exchange (SCX) can be used for additional sample pre-fractionation. These additional fractionation steps further decrease the number of peptides entering the mass spectrometer at a given time and increases the probability that the less abundant peptides will be detected, sequenced, and identified.",

As already noted, only the most intense ions from the MS spectra are likely to be chosen for fragmentation in the MS/MS mode without user intervention.

Therefore, the peptides from the four samples labeled with different tags and then mixed before fractionation elute from the chromatographic gradient together and are observed as one peak in the MS spectra. The quantification is performed in the MS/MS mode, together with peptide identification, when the co-eluted tagged peptides are fragmented. The fragmentation breaks bonds within the peptide as well as between the peptide and mass tag in a way that separates the tag from the mass balancing component bound to the labeled amino acid.

The immobilized fraction can consist of capture molecules, such as purified recombinant ligands, peptides, antibodies, antibody fragments, antibody mimicking aptamers, or, in the case of reverse phase protein microarrays, a complex solution of sample cell lysates. When capture molecules are immobilized, the sample solution is applied over the spots. When the lysate is immobilized, it is probed with soluble capture molecules. The latter provides an advantage in miniaturization: a single spot can contain as little protein as from a single cell. On the other hand, the stability of microarrays has to be considered: spotted antibodies are usually more stable and less affected by prolonged storage than immobilized whole lysates.",

The stability and, to some extent, the variability issues are prevented in a recently developed protein microarray method called nucleic acid programmable protein array (NAPPA), where functional proteins are translated in situ from DNA printed on the spots with the use of in vitro transcription-translation system (IVTT) (259) . The coding region of the cDNA corresponding to a protein to be expressed is engineered into an RNA expression plasmid and fused to a co-expressed GST-tag. Plasmid DNA is cross-linked to a psoralen-biotin conjugate with the use of ultraviolet light, and arrayed onto glass slides together with avidin and polyclonal GST antibody. At this stage, the array is dried and can be stored at room temperature. To activate and use the array, the IVTT (such as reticulocyte lysate with T7 polymerase to generate synthetic RNA) is added to the array. The transcribed RNA is translated by the IVTT and the expressed proteins are immediately immobilized in their spots by the capture of the GST-tag by anti-GST antibody. Independently, similar alternative strategies have been developed: MIST (multiple spotting technique) spots the IVTT from E.coli on a printed PCR template; in DAPA (DNA array to protein array) proteins translated on the cDNA array diffuse through a membrane infused with cell-free extract to a surface with capture molecules; and high density peptide-and protein chips can be produced by immediate immobilization of proteins synthesized on stalled ribosomes with puromycingrafted oligonucleotides (260) . Such approaches ensure reproducible, fresh, high-yield protein microarrays for each experiment. Also, the expression clones can be stored in large collection in cassettes, permitting facile examination of the proteins encoded by interesting clones after their expression in live cells using a mammalian expression vector containing the same insert. Protein microarrays can be used to quantify protein abundance in the samples as well as to explore protein function, for example kinase activity measured by substrate phosphorylation levels.",

This method involves cell fixation and permeabilization prior to staining with antiphosphoprotein antibodies. Carefully developed procedure with specific reagents compatible with flow cytometry and use of combinations of phospho-specific antibodies labeled with different fluorophores provides a rapid and efficient means to measure the levels of a variety of intracellular phosphoepitopes (262) . The number of distinct phosphoepitopes depends only on the current capabilities of flow cytometry (as of now, 17 markers can be measured simultaneously (3)). To increase sample throughput, a cell-based multiplexing approach, called fluorescent cell barcoding (FCB), was developed especially for phosphoflow (263) and is based on a similar principle to that used for multiplexing in bead-based cytokine assays. In FCB, samples are labeled with fluorophore to variable intensity, which is achieved by treatment with different concentrations of the reactive form of the fluorophore. In this way, each sample gets a unique signature of fluorescence intensity. With one fluorophore, 4-6 different samples can be analyzed together. Because multiple fluorophores can be used to label the cells, the number of different fluorescent signatures increases geometrically (16-36 samples can be monitored with the combination of two markers). The method has been reported to increase the resolution when used with 96 samples simultaneously, at the same time reducing antibody consumption and acquisition time.",

The alternatives for fluorophores in multiparameter detection include Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS), which has been implemented in flow cytometry and microscopy in several variants (264) (265) (266) , and a newly reported technology called mass cytometry (CyTOF) (267) . CyTOF replaces fluorescent labels with specially designed multiatom elemental (lanthanide) antibody tags. These labels are detected by an inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ICP-TOF-MS) that has recently become commercially available. The ICP source produces transient ion clouds from cells or beads, and the ions from the generated supersonic plasma jet are detected by a fast TOF ion detector. The signal is amplified and digitized, so even low intensity signals can be detected. The availability of many stable isotopes for the antibody tags facilitates simultaneous detection of many target molecules in the sample -the authors demonstrate the method as applied to 20 antigens in model leukemia cell lines and acute myeloid leukemia patient samples, but the method can be broadened to analyze many more antigens on individual cells in a single experiment. The initial device and methods do not permit cell sorting, however, because particles are completely disintegrated during the analysis, but techniques are being developed to allow elution of the labels and timed collection of the eluted material to maintain correspondence to the cell of origin in the flow stream, so this limitation may change in the near future. Other limitations include the analysis of only a subset (presently 30% but soon to be >70%) of the applied cell sample), slower cell throughput than conventional flow cytometers, and reduced sensitivity on the very low end of expression. Nevertheless, the ability to analyze dozens of target antigens with no concern of spectral overlap or the need for complex compensation methods makes this an extremely promising new method that may help generate highly quantitative data on a single cell level in multiplexed form for use in modeling studies. On the other hand, the greatly increased number of parameters being examined makes data analysis much more complex; even downloading the files from the instrument pushes the limits of current computers and new configurations of processors in specialized devices are being developed to handle the data throughput, while new computational algorithms for automatic clustering of the many parameters being measured will enable rapid and unbiased assessment of the multidimensional data (263) .",

For all these aspects of biology that one might wish to incorporate in models and simulations, microscopic imaging is the method of choice, with implementations ranging from ultrahigh resolution electron microscopic tomography to define structural details for models of such processes as neurotransmitter release in a synapse (268; 269) , to super-resolution light imaging to better understand the location of molecules in a single cell (270) , to TIRF-imaging to investigate components involved in membrane-related events with counterligands displayed in planar membrane surfaces (271) , to live cell confocal and 2-photon imaging in 2 and 3-D environments (272; 273) and intravital imaging using 2photon instruments to assess cell behavior and signaling in complex tissues and organs (274) . Especially through the use of methods of fluorescence microscopy that allow specific molecules to be tagged with light-emitting proteins (275) , it is possible to collect quantitative spatiotemporal information about protein expression, molecular movements, and cytoskeletal changes, among other parameters, in living cells over prolonged time frames. Coupled with the use of emerging microfluidic methods that parallelize the treatment of individual members of cell population with the same stimulus and allow for simultaneous imaging of this cell population, one can develop extensive datasets on multiple target molecules through color multiplexing and with additional information about intercellular heterogeneity within the cell population in terms of both molecular expression and cell behavior in response to the stimulus (276; 277).",

The broad spectrum of fluorophores emitting light of different colors allows simultaneous detection of several molecules at the same time. Basic epi-fluorescence microscopy is affordable and requires simple instruments, but the blurring of the image due to the light emission from different depths of the sample is a constant challenge, especially for correct quantitative measurements. This problem is overcome by confocal microscopy, where only the light from the focal plane is collected. The resulting sharp images allow the reconstruction of the three-dimensional image by stacking a series of optical x-y section in the z-plane (z-stacks). Confocal microscopy can be used for quantitative measurements of cell motility and dynamic intracellular events in time-lapse experiments (278) , although there are limitations. High-energy excitation photons from the lasers used on confocal microscopes can lead to phototoxicity and photobleaching, and scattering limits the thickness of the sample to 80 \u03bcm (278). The alternative technology is multiphoton laser scanning fluorescence microscopy (279) , which used lower energy light in short pulses, compensating the energy by simultaneous absorption of multiple photons for excitation of the sample. Two-photon microscopy, where two photons of infrared light are enough to cause light emission from the fluorophore, yields superb results in thicker (up to 1 mm) samples of live, explanted immune tissues with limited photodamage. Although often considered 'confocal' inherently, 2-photon imaging does have a lower axial (z-dimension) resolution as compared to confocal designs and for isolated cells, the latter is often preferable if bleaching and phototoxicity are not limitations in the experiment.",

All of these types of information are critical for the generation of fine-grained models of cellular behavior, especially signaling pathways leading to gene activation that can be assessed by the nucleic acid technologies also described here, but using this information for model building and simulation is still impeded by the absence of many of the quantitative parameters that can constrain the substantial degrees of freedom in such models, particularly those involving the dynamics of molecular interactions and of enzymatic processes. Only a few of the required numbers exist in a validated form in the literature, in part because until recently it was unclear to investigators why time and resources should be spent determining affinity constants and catalytic rates. With the advent of an increased emphasis on modeling in immunology, such numbers have become much more important, though still sparse.

            "text": "The binding constants necessary for detailed molecular interaction models are possible to obtain with the use of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology, implemented in instruments such as Biacore (GE) or ProteOn (BioRad). The phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance occurs when the plasmons (electron charge density waves) on the planar surface of the metal in a special chip (such as gold) are excited by a change in the boundary of this surface with a medium of different refractive index (such as buffer). This occurs when the mass of material at the buffer-chip interface changes, as will be the case when an applied substance binds to molecules immobilized on the chip surface. Since the resultant resonance change is not affected by sample color or opacity, SPR can used to determine the interactions between many different types of ligands and their binding partners, to search for novel protein-protein, DNA-protein and DNA-RNA interactions and to determine drug targets (297) . At the present, a major limitation of this method is the substantial amount of effort required to produce very pure protein in a form suitable for either linkage to the chip surface or for adding as the analyte to a derivatized chip. The generation of such purified reagents is typically a slow process involving one molecule at a time and the production of a reliable dataset can take months. This is clearly inadequate for use in parameterizing complex models with many components. However, improvements in chip design, especially the multiplexing capacity of microfluidic versions of these instruments, allow many assays to be performed in parallel. There is the prospect of combining some of the technology of NAPPA for in vitro synthesis of proteins from expression clones with such microfluidic multiplexed SPR devices to enable analysis of dozens of molecular interactions in a short (several week) period without the need for individual molecule purification, albeit with less precision than would be the case for carefully purified individual components. However, the nature of molecular models is such that small errors in such measurements typically have little effect on model performance, but they do need to be in the right overall numerical range; sensitivity testing of the model can determine which parameters are most critical to simulated outcomes and these can point to specific interactions that might require remeasurement by the more precise methods involving highly purified material. This combination of multiplexed SPR with NAPPA-style synthesis of relevant molecules can open the door to the collection of interaction parameters needed for fine-grained modeling at a pace and to an extent that will allow a substantial reduction in the degrees of freedom in molecular models.",

One of the areas that has yielded especially intriguing results is the study of the dendritic cell proteome. Dendritic cells (DCs), a heterogeneous population of professional antigen presenting cells, consist of a number of distinct subtypes, distinguishable by multiple surface markers. These DC subtypes differ substantially in origin and function. Luber et al. (238) looked at the differences in protein abundance in some of the commonly described DC subsets using a label-free quantitative mass spectrometry approach with an in-house quantification algorithm. They profiled protein abundance differences among conventional DC subsets, which they defined as conventional CD8+, CD4+, and double negative DCs separated by flow cytometry, to a depth of more than 5000 proteins and requiring only 1.5-2.0 \u00d7 10 6 purified cells. The results were validated with surface markers of known abundance in DC subtypes and comparison to the results of previous microarray studies. Based on the latter comparisons, the authors conclude that this approach is a reliable method to study closely related cell types in vivo. The analysis revealed mutually exclusive expression of some pattern recognition pathways (differential expression of members of the NLR, TLR, and RLH signaling pathways in response to flu virus and Sendai virus), which might explain differences in response to different pathogens. These new data provided new insight into the regulation of PRRs in infected cells. A more focused approach was used by Segura et al. (298) , who isolated the plasma membranes of mouse spleen CD8+ and CD8\u2212 DCs by immunoaffinity methods and analyzed their protein composition using mass spectrometry. The results were only semiquantitative, because only the spectral counting method was used. Nevertheless, the comparative analysis suggested that many known or potential pathogen-recognition receptors and immunomodulatory molecules are differentially expressed, and these results were subsequently confirmed by flow cytometry and Western blot analyses. At this point in time, however, these profiling experiments are mainly cataloguing exercises that yield parts lists for future studies of a more integrated and functional nature.",

Most examinations of phophorylation sites involved in T-cell signaling have thus utilized the leukemic Jurkat T cell line (299) . However, recent increases in instrument sensitivity and improved enrichment methods now allow analysis of primary cells and reports of phosphoproteomics in non-transformed T-cells have begun to appear. Iwai et al. examined the tyrosine phosphorylation network in T-cell receptor signaling in cells from diabetes-prone and normal mice, identifying and quantifying over 100 tyrosine phosphorylation sites using iTRAQ labeling (255) . More frequently, phospho-specific flow cytometry has been utilized to analyze phosphorylation-based signaling in the immune system cells. Hale et al. (300) applied phosphoflow to examine the changes in cytokine signal transduction through the STAT family of transcription factors during clinical progression of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in human patients. The measurements of signaling responses at the single-cell level in five immune cell types to a panel of 10 cytokines thought to play essential roles in SLE led to a highly multiplexed view of cytokine signal processing in adaptive and innate immune cells. Robust changes, including an increase in the T-cell response to IL-10 and cessation of STAT molecule responses to multiple cytokines, were found during progression of SLE, providing evidence for negative feedback regulation and existence of a cytokine-driven oscillator, which may regulate periodic changes in SLE activity. In early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA), 15 signaling effectors were examined by phospho-flow in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, identifying patterns of effector activation by phosphorylation characteristic for rheumatoid arthritis (distinct from the patterns observed in osteoarthritis), but the same in ERA as in the late RA (301) . For example the ratio of p-AKT to p-p38 was significantly elevated in patients with RA, and may be used for diagnostic purposes. To date, these data have not been used to derive models suitable for simulation and testing of intracellular signaling, but rather serve primarily as tools for biomarker development.",

The analysis of IgG and IgM autoantibodies binding to over 300 self-antigens revealed informative antibody patterns responding to the growth of the tumor cells and distinguishing between animals bearing metastatic and non-metastatic tumors. Nucleic acid-programmable protein microarrays (NAPPA) were successfully used (303) to identify Pseudomonas aeruginosa proteins that trigger an adaptive immune response in cystic fibrosis. Out of 262 P. aeruginosa outer membrane and exported proteins examined, antibodies to 12 were detected in statistically significant number of patients and confirmed by ELISA as potential candidates for future vaccine development. Ceroni et al. (304) used the same technology to investigate the adaptive immune response to infection with Varicella zoster virus. All 69 virus proteins were studied in sera from 68 infected individuals and the IgG antibodies against many viral antigens were detected and validated by Western blot. These antibodies were only present in the subset of VZV-positive patients, demonstrating the complexity of the humoral immune response to the viral infection and validating the NAPPA approach for the development of diagnostic tests. Protein arrays were used also for systemic, large-scale profiling of the specificity of antibody responses against autoantigens in a panel of autoimmune diseases (305) and allergies (306; 307) .",

We have a rather limited ability to visualize the very non-linear ways in which concatenated feedback circuits so characteristic of the immune system affect its output. This demands the use of formal mathematical treatments to associate modest differences in component concentrations, binding affinities, enzymatic activity, cell replication and death rates, and the like with the effects of gene polymorphism and mutation or drug treatments on system performance. The recent evidence for digital behavior in the central Erk signaling pathway (308) (309) (310) , for the role of very modest differences in transcription factor concentration in controlling developmental cell fate of lymphocytes (311) (312) (313) , or for small differences in the ratio of regulatory vs. effector cells in determining the presence or absence of autoimmune disease (314) all speak to the need to develop more quantitative methods for integrating our fine-grained knowledge of immune components into larger schemes that better reflect system output.",

Second, the dissemination of improved tools for constructing complex models, conducting simulations, and sharing the results, together with greater access to ever cheaper mass computing power, will empower the community to work together in building and utilizing better and bigger models. Finally, the changes already in progress in the way students are educated, with the inclusion of more statistics, mathematics, and computer programming at various stages of secondary, college, and post-graduate education, will make it easier for new investigators to incorporate these methods into their research activities, just as the familiarity of newly minted MDs and PhDs with 'omic' technologies has led over the past decade to the facile inclusion of such methods into their projects.
