The virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) on 11 February 2020. 5 There have now been cases of infection elsewhere in the world, and as of 12 February 2020, >40,000 patients in China have been diagnosed with this coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) , with more than 1,000 deaths, and the number of infections has exceeded that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, which first infected humans in Guangdong Province of southern China in 2003. 1 On 31 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterised COVID-19 as an epidemic and international public health emergency. 2 SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid is a single positive-stranded RNA with a diameter of approximately 80e120 nm. It can use itself as a template to guide the synthesis of virusrelated proteins. 6 The diagnosis of COVID-19 depends on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for quantitative detection of nucleic acid. 3 COVID-19 causes inflammatory lesions in the lungs denoted novel coronavirus pneumonia. Chest computed tomography (CT) is the main examination for lung lesions and plays a vital role in the clinical diagnosis, observation of curative effect, and prognostic evaluation of this disease. The present study was undertaken to analyse the chest CT images of 80 patients retrospectively, including highresolution CT (HRCT) or thin-layer CT images, combined with clinical data and related literature, to further our understanding of NCP.",

In this article, the pathological principles of viral pneumonia and the study of SARS and MERS literature were used to explore the CT imaging manifestations of NCP. Coronaviruses have high variability. Both SARS, which occurred in 2003, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012, are caused by coronaviruses. 7, 8 Regarding pathological changes, the virus enters the human respiratory system through the respiratory tract or mucous membrane, and enters the alveolar stroma along the bronchi and bronchioles. Because the bronchi and bronchiolar cilia have a filtering and cleaning effect, particles >2 mm in diameter can be removed; however, particles or microorganisms <2 mm in diameter cannot be removed. 9 The subpleural area is the structure of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. There is no ciliated tissue in this area, and the virus cannot be removed. Therefore, the subpleural area is the most easily colonised area. The basic lesion of viral pneumonia is interstitial pneumonia. 10 Virus invasion into the body initially causes alveolar septal capillaries to dilate and congest, and a small amount of fluid is seen in the alveolar cavity. The lesion is centred on the secondary lung lobules with lobular septal oedema. As the virus multiplies in the body, the alveolar interstitial phase of pneumonia occurs caused by further expansion of the blood vessels and increasing exudate in the alveolar cavity, cellulose exudation is seen in the lungs, and the lesion area increases. During the dissipative period, there is reduction in the oedema of the alveolar capillaries and lobular septum, alveolar exudation and absorption, the remaining lobular septum is thickened, and the bronchial wall is thickened or appears twisted into a cord. Regarding imaging findings, when the disease is in the early stage, alveolar wall oedema causes little exudation in the alveoli, and the alveolar cavity body is not completely replaced by the exudate. On HRCT or thin-layer CT, a patchy ground glass with a secondary pulmonary lobular lesion of approximately 8e12 mm was seen. CT lung window density increased slightly, and a pulmonary vascular shadow was clearly seen in the lesion, but it was not visible on the mediastinal window.",

            "text": "SARS pneumonia occurred in 2003. At that time, the main examination method for lung lesions was chest radiography. 11, 12 Liu et al. 13 analysed the chest radiographs of 260 SARS patients and found that they were able to show and diagnose infection. Atypical pneumonia should be used as a routine test for infectious atypical pneumonia. Some researchers have conducted preliminary investigations on the CT manifestations of SARS, and the results have shown that CT is helpful for the detection of early-stage pneumonia under the pleura, whereas chest radiography is less sensitive to ground glass. 14, 15 Since the outbreak of MERS in 2012, the awareness of clinical and imaging physicians of the capabilities of chest CT has significantly improved, and chest CT has been recommended for the early diagnosis of the disease. 16 Early CT manifestations of SARS and MERS are single or sporadic ground glass opacities in the subpleural area. 17 As the disease progresses, inflammatory exudations spread through the alveolar foramen. CT has shown that the extent of the lesion is enlarged and patchy; this is unlike some SARS lesions, which are migratory, 18 NCP is enlarged in the original lesions or new lesions occur elsewhere. At the same time, in this study, the lobular interval of the lesion area was thickened, and the HRCT showed a \"gridlike\" (Fig 2) or a \"paving stone-like\" change. This is because the degree of pulmonary interstitial lesions was greater than that of alveolar parenchymal lesions, and the extent of lesions on the mediastinal window was smaller than that of lesions on the lung window. Exudation was obvious in some areas, and the lungs showed patchy consolidation and increased density. Pulmonary blood vessels and lesions could not be distinguished, but the \"air bronchus sign\" remained visible. From the lesion to the interlobular fissure, the spread across the lung lobe ceased, and clear interlobular fissures were visible, because the interlobular pleura prevented the spread of inflammation. Strand shadows were visible in the lungs when exudation was distributed along the bronchioles based on gravity. In severe cases, large ground glass or consolidation shadows can be seen in both lungs, showing \"white-lung-like\" changes.",

At this stage, the lesions show a reduction in the scope of the lesion, a decrease in the density of ground glass or consolidation, and a decrease in CT attenuation. Hsieh et al. 20 suggested that SARS lesions in the lungs may vary depending on the patient's physique, treatment, and condition. Some patients absorbed lesions within 3 months, and long-term, patients still had a shadow within 1 year. The CT manifestations of the recovery period are related to the extent of the lesions. In patients with minor lesions, these can be clearly absorbed within 2 weeks. Residual patchy consolidation, thickened leaflet intervals, or twisted and thick bronchioles can be seen in moderately affected patients, suggesting the recovery of interstitial changes, which takes time. After 1 year of followup of severe patients, subpleural cord shadows can still be seen in the lungs, which are considered fibrotic lesions.",

It is worth mentioning Figure 5 Male, 27 years old, with fever and fatigue for 5 days. a) chest CT obtained 5 days after the onset of symptoms. CT images shows consolidation of the right lobe and lower lobe of the lung. The lesions were close to the pleura. b). Follow-up CT obtained on 13 days after the onset of symptoms. The lesions were absorbed and the range was reduced. Lesions in the lower lobe of the left lung were absorbed from the center and showed a \"reverse halo sign\" (arrow). that in the present cohort, five patients had positive lung lesions, but the nucleic acid test was negative at that time. Patients are generally in good condition. Another patient had bacterial infection of the lung and a large patch of consolidation was seen in the lung, which was different from typical viral pneumonia. This suggests that there is the possibility of viral pneumonia with concomitant bacterial infections.",
