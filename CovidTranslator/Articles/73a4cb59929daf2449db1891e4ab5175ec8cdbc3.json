The laboratory rat is a descendent of the wild rat, Rattus norv\u00e9giens, which originated in Asia and reached Europe in the early 1700s. Wild and albino mutants were first used for ex perimental purposes in Europe in the mid-1800s and in the United States shortly before 1900. The Wistar Institute in Phil adelphia was prominent in the development of the rat as a labo ratory animal, for here originated many of the rat strains now used worldwide. Henry Donaldson and his colleagues at the Wistar Institute used these early rat strains for a variety of stud ies dealing with neuroanatomy, nutrition, endocrinology, ge netics, and behavior. The history and evolution of the many rat strains used today have been recently summarized (Lindsey, 1979) .",

Ac cordingly, the genotype of outbred stocks and inbred strains may vary among sources and be reflected by differences in data when multiple sources of rats are used. A standardized scheme of identifying stocks and strains of rats has been devel oped and is now used by nearly all commercial vendors. More over, it is important that authors correctly identify stocks and strains that are used in their research since the success in re peating the work in another laboratory may be dependent upon the genotype (source of the rat).

A more complete barrier system may include an entry area in which incoming supplies and equipment are sterilized and in which personnel shower and don sterile clothing and filter masks before entering animal rooms.

Room temperatures between 72 and 76\u00b0F are desirable, and the relative humidity should range be tween 40 and 60%. Daily fluctuations in temperature and hu midity act as significant Stressors. These fluctuations may be associated with the environmental control system of a building or may be induced by procedures such as cleaning floors with a water hose or high pressure sprayer. Twenty-four-hour tem perature/humidity recorders are useful in detecting changes in environmental conditions. Light intensity should be evenly distributed to all animals within a room. Seventy-five to 125 fc have often been suggested as an optimal range for light inten sity. However, recent evidence indicates that this intensity can induce retinal degeneration in albino rats (Anver and Cohen, 1979) .

Feed should be contained in hoppers. Either automatic systems or bottles are satisfactory for providing water to rats. Some caution is necessary when using automatic systems, since weanling and newly arrived rats may not drink initially from such devices. To avoid undesirable microbial contamination, water bottles should be sanitized before they are refilled and automatic sys tems should be drained and flushed when racks are sanitized.

The vagina opens between 34 and 109 days, and the testes descend between 15 and 51 days, although they remain fully retractable in adults. Rats ovulate spontaneously, but ovulation can also be induced by forced coitus during nonestrous intervals. Vaginal stimulation during mating is impor tant in rat reproductive physiology. The more often a male inserts his penis into the vagina prior to ejaculation, the greater the probability of a resulting pregnancy. However, natural or artificial stimulation of the vagina within 15 min of a first mat ing will abrogate pregnancy from the first mating by inhibition of sperm transport. A 12-hr estrous period recurs every 4 to 5 days and after parturition, without seasonal variation. Estrus can be suppressed when females are housed in groups and syn chronized in the presence of a male or its excreta (Whitten effect), but this effect is not as pronounced as in the mouse. Female fertility wanes at 600 to 650 days, but estrous cycles may continue through 32 months. Male fertility is lost between 16 and 20 months. Fertility of both sexes is generally regarded as maximal between 100 and 300 days of age (Adler and Zoluth, 1970; Baker, 1979; Farris, 1963; Lane-Petter, 1972; Leathern, 1979) .",

Rats used in research animal facilities are ob tained from various commercial and institutional sources. Ac cordingly, it is essential that the mycoplasma status of these sources is known and that the rats are housed by vendor or in groups with a similar microbial status. For assessment of whether a group of rats is M. pulmonisfree, the best sites for isolation in animals without gross lesions are the nasal cavity, middle ear, trachea, and uterus-oviduct. Mycoplasma pulmonis is not particularly fastidious and grows well in several types of mycoplasma media (Cassell et al., 1979; Lentsch et al., 1979) . Most formulations have a pH indi cator that is useful since M. pulmonis ferments glucose. In broth media, moderate to heavy growth is reflected by pH and color of the broth. In broth cultures in which the titer is low, a perceptable pH change may not occur. Tissue and washing samples should be placed in broth rather than agar media, since recovery of the organism is more likely in those samples con taining few mycoplasmas. Samples from broth cultures are transferred to agar media when a pH change is readily evident or at 7-10 days if no pH change occurs. Mycoplasma colonies are evident in 3-4 days by observation with 40 x stereoscopic microscopy.",

Rat virus has broad tissue tropism and lesions or clinical signs may potentially be varied, depending on virus and host factors (Coleman et al., 1982; Jacoby et al, 1979) .",

Two strains of coronavirus have been identified as pathogens of laboratory rats: siaiodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) and rat coronavirus (RCV). Furthermore, rats are experimen tally susceptible to the coronavirus of mice, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Coronaviruses are large, pleomorphic enveloped RNA viruses with surface peplomers or spikes that confer a corona-like appearance to the virion. Viruses of this group have complex antigenic interrelationships and cross-react ex tensively. Common antigens are shared by SDAV, RCV, and MHV, particularly by complement fixation, but antibody reac tivity is highest with homologous virus. Siaiodacryoadenitis virus and RCV represent different strains of the same virus, but whether different strains of the same virus or separate viruses, they are both important natural pathogens in rats. The signifi cance of MHV for rats is not known, but the virus can replicate in the respiratory tract of intranasally inoculated rats (Taguchi et al., 1979) . Natural antibodies to MHV can occur in rats, but this is probably due to the closely related antigenicity of MHV to SDAV and RCV rather than natural MHV infection of rats (Barthold, 1984) .",

Diagnosis is achieved by exam ination of large bowel contents (particularly the cecum and proximal colon) for nematodes, feces for ova, and, in the case of Syphacia, cellophane tape impressions of the anus for ova.

Enteritis can occur in heavy infestations, which are most likely to be encountered with H. nana. Both can infect primates, in cluding humans. Hymenolepis nana, which does not need an intermediate host and can cause autoinfection, is a particular public health hazard. Anthelmintic treatment is effective (Table IX) . Diagnosis of Hymenolepis is made by finding ova containing hexacanth embryos in the feces or adults in the lumen of the bowel. Differential features are detailed else where (Hsu, 1979) .",

Natural deficiencies of single dietary compo nents are rare and seldom recognized. This is because rats ef fectively store fat-soluble vitamins (and B 12 ), manufacture vi tamin C, and fulfill much of their requirement for B vitamins by coprophagy. Furthermore, some deficiencies are influenced or compensated for by other dietary elements. The most com mon signs of nutritional deficiency are vague, such as poor hair coat, reduced weight gain or growth, diminished fertility, and susceptibility to infectious disease. Commercially avail able rodent diets effectively supply balanced diets to rodents, but diets should not be utilized beyond their expiration date and ideally should be kept in cold storage. Several components deteriorate with prolonged storage, heating, or sterilization, in cluding lysine, vitamins A and E, and, to a lesser extent, riboflavin and thiamin. Nutritional requirements vary with the genetic strain, stage of life, and microbiological association. Axenic or specific pathogen-free (SPF) animals can lack gut microflora necessary for supplying certain vitamins, particu larly vitamin K. They must receive supplemented diets both because they need more and because autoclaving or pasteuriza tion reduce the levels of certain essential nutrients. Antibiotic treatment, which affects intestinal microflora, can reduce the bacterial source of vitamins by coprophagy. Nutritional ade quacy goes far beyond the needs of the rat, since the composi tion of nutritionally adequate diets is known to profoundly in fluence the biological responsiveness to research manipula tion, infectious disease, and expression of spontaneous lesions (National Research Council, 1978; Rogers, 1979) .",

Squamous metaplasia in the salivary and lacrimai glands of rats recovering from SDAV or in the respiratory tract of rats infected with Sendai virus or M. pulmonis must be differentiated from hypo vitaminosis A, which in turn predisposes to respiratory infec tions.

Rats adapt well to automatic watering systems, but animals unfamiliar with these devices can become dehydrated. Similarly, mal function of these systems and blockage of water bottle sippe tubes with metal filings or other detritus can have a similar effect. Rats maintained for long periods on wire-bottom cages develop foot sores, which can result in severe lesions, discom fort, hemorrhage, and anemia. Aging rats must be examined periodically for overgrowth of their incisors, a very common problem in rats held long term. Teeth must be carefully clip ped, avoiding splitting or shattering. Dusty bedding and food can result in foreign body pneumonia. Plant, mineral, and even bone fragments can be found in sections of lung obtained from rats under these circumstances. Softwood shavings used as bedding can cause intestinal impaction, particularly in young rats. High ambient light, or even light levels within the recom mended range, can cause retinal degeneration and cataracts in albino rats. Rats maintained near ceiling light fixtures develop retinal degeneration, while those near the floor are spared. Low relative humidity (<40%) in concert with high tempera ture and other factors can cause one or more annular constric tions of the tail skin (ringtail) or toes. The segments distal to the constrictions swell or undergo dry gangrene (Fig. 10) . This is most apt to occur in suckling or preweanling rats and in rats kept in wire-bottom cages. Increasing humidity, reducing air turnover rate, placing rats in solid-bottom cages, and providing nesting material for nursing dams and their litters are all ame liorative for this condition.",

Chronic pro gressive nephropathy is among the most commonly encoun tered lesions in the rat, particularly in the aged animal where it is a major life-limiting disease. Because of its complex nature, CPN has a large number of synonyms, often with inaccurate descriptive titles. Sequential development of lesions and fac tors that modify the course of CPN have been thoroughly stud ied, but the actual pathogenesis remains undetermined. Chron ic progressive nephropathy occurs in most rats, but its rate of development is significantly influenced by numerous factors, including sex, genetics, age, diet, association with microflora, hormone treatment (particularly testosterone), and others. Male rats have an earlier onset and more rapid progression of CPN than females, and albino strains and stocks seem to be more predisposed. Diet is an extremely important predisposing factor, particularly the quality and quantity of dietary protein.",

In late CPN there is nonselective excretion, and the electrophoretic pattern of urinary protein resembles that of serum. Proteinuria related to CPN should not be confused with the normal urinary excretion of a-globulin in male rats, proba bly of tubular origin. The histopathology of CPN is charac terized as progressive basement membrane thickening of the glomerulus, Bowman's capsule, and proximal tubule. Base ment membranes split and wrinkle as tubules become atrophie and collapse. Glomeruli enlarge, with mesangial deposition of protein and lipid, adhesion to Bowman's capsule, and segmen tai sclerosis. Tubular epithelium may contain granules of resorbed protein, which later is mixed with lipofuscin and hemosiderin. As glomerular protein leakage becomes more severe, 119 tubules dilate and accumulate hyaline eosinophilic castes of protein within their lumina, resembling colloid. Tubular epi thelium may undergo atrophy with collapse or dilatation. In terstitial fibrosis and leukocytic infiltration is frequently ob served. Grossly, the kidneys become enlarged, pale with irregular surfaces and pigmented (Fig. 14) . Cystic tubules can be observed. Hypoproteinemia, parathyroid hyperplasia with serum chemical changes indicative of hyperparathyroidism, and nephrotic syndrome are observed in rats with severe CPN (Barthold, 1979) .",
