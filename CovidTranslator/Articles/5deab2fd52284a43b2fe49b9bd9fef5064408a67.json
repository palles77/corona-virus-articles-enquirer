In this study, the expression of eleven housekeeping genes typically used for the normalization of quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) analysis in mammals were compared in CEFs infected with H5N1 AIV to determine the most reliable reference genes in this system. CEFs cultured from 10-day-old SPF chicken embryos were infected with 100 TCID 50 of H5N1 AIV and harvested at 3, 12, 24 and 30 hours post-infection. The expression levels of the eleven reference genes in infected and uninfected CEFs were determined by real-time PCR. Based on expression stability and expression levels, our data suggest that the ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4) and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ) are the best reference genes to use in the study of host cell response to H5N1 AIV infection. However, for the study of replication levels of H5N1 AIV in CEFs, the \u03b2-actin gene (ACTB) and the ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4) gene are the best references.",

Real-time PCR of housekeeping genes The annealing temperature and primer concentration were optimized for all 11 housekeeping genes. Realtime PCR was performed in an ABI 7300 Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems ) in 96-well microtiter plates using a final volume of 20 \u03bcL. Reactions were performed in triplicate for each sample, and the mean value for each sample was calculated. Electrophoresis analysis of all the amplified products from real-time PCR showed single bands with the expected sizes, and no primer dimer was observed. The dissociation plots provided by the ABI 7300 also showed a single peak for each reaction. Standard curve of real-time PCR Standard curves were generated using copy number vs. threshold cycle (Ct). The linear correlation coefficients (R 2 ) of all eleven housekeeping genes were between 0.986 and 0.998. Based on the slopes of the standard curves, amplification efficiencies were between 95.66% and 109.95%, as derived from the formula E = 10 1/-slope -1.

Those genes were chosen because they are expressed extensively in all cells and have different functions, in order to avoid genes belonging to the same biological pathways that may be co-regulated. To the best of our knowledge, RPL4, YWHAZ, SDHA, HPRT1, ALB, RPL30, and TUBB were first investigated for their potential value as reference genes in chicken. Our result showed that SDHA, ALB, and B2M had low expression levels compared with other housekeeping genes both in the normal CEF and infected CEF, making them unsuitable reference genes for QPCR in chicken. The expression stabilities of the eleven genes were determined at four time-points representing early, middle and late stages of infection. The gene expression stability showed certain differences between normal CEFs and infected CEFs. H5N1 AIV may have a different effect on transcription of these genes in the infected CEFs, making the ideal reference genes different in infected versus uninfected cells. As the 2 -\u25b3\u25b3Ct calculation method with respect to an internal control is the main method of relative quantitative analysis of real-time PCR in the study of host mRNA responses to virus infection [6] , ideal reference genes should be expressed stably in both infected cells and mock-infected cells. Upon evaluation of the stability of 11 housekeeping genes with the GeNorm tool in normal and H5N1 AIV-infected CEFs, RPL4 and YWHAZ were determined to be the two best reference genes to use for the study of cellular responses to H5N1 AIV infection. This finding is useful in making quantitative analysis of host mRNA expression levels by real-time PCR more precise and reliable. In this study, ACTB and RPL4 were the two most stably expressed housekeeping genes in the H5N1 AIV-infected CEFs. Thus, these genes can be used as ideal references in the quantitation of H5N1 replication by real-time PCR, because of that mockinfection cells are not concerned in this situation.",
