In protocols of western medicine clinical trials, the number of primary outcomes are from 1 (39/63, 61.90%) to 10 (1/63, 1.59%), the number of secondary outcomes are from 0 (8/63, 12.70%) to 15(1/63, 1.59%). 5 (5/63, 7.94%) protocols of clinical trials reported other outcomes (the number of outcomes are from 1 to 5). For individual clinical trial, the number of outcomes are from 1 (4/63, 6.35%) to 16 (1/63, 1.59%). The number of outcomes in protocols of western medicine clinical trials is shown in Figure 3. After merging and grouping outcomes, there are 76 different outcomes from 16 outcome domains in 34 protocols of TCM clinical trials (table 4). Almost half of outcomes are reported only once (34/76, 44.74%). The most frequently reported outcome is \"time of SARS-CoV-2 RNA turns to negative\", which is reported 16 times.

Only 10 outcomes are provided one or more measurement time frame. The summary of outcome reporting for protocols of TCM clinical trials is shown in Figure 4. In the 16 outcome domains of protocols of TCM clinical trials, 4 outcome domains (adverse events/effects, hepatobiliary outcomes, mortality/survival, psychiatric outcomes) consisted of only one outcome. These outcomes are reported between 1 and 9 times, and the median outcome reporting time was 6.5. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal outcomes have the largest number of outcomes, which includes 17 outcomes; chest imaging is reported more frequently than other outcomes. The number of outcomes in different outcome domains in protocols of TCM clinical trials is shown in Figure 5. After merging and grouping, there are 126 different outcomes from 17 outcome domains in 63 protocols of western medicine clinical trials (table 5). Almost half of outcomes are reported only once (62/126, 49.21%). The most frequently reported outcome is \"proportion of patients with negative SARS-CoV-2\", which is reported 40 times. Only 11 (11/126, 8.73%) outcomes are reported more than 10 times. Only 27 outcomes are provided one or more outcome measurement instruments.
