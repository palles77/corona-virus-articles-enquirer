            "text": "virus (EBOV) can cause severe disease in humans. The 2013-2016 West African 37 epidemic and the two recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo underscore the 38 urgent need for effective countermeasures, which remain lacking. A better understanding of 39 EBOV biology and the modulation of multifunctional viral proteins is desperately needed to 40 develop improved therapeutics. We provide evidence here that function of virion protein 35 41 (VP35) is modulated by phosphorylation of Ser129, a conserved residue among other 42 ebolavirus species. These findings shed light on EBOV biology and present a potential target for 43 broad acting anti-ebolavirus therapeutics. 44 Introduction 54 Ebolaviruses are zoonotic pathogens associated with severe hemorrhagic disease in humans 55 (Messaoudi et al., 2015, Nelson et al., 2017). The genus Ebolavirus, which is of the family 56 Filoviridae and order Mononegavirales, includes six species of filamentous, enveloped, non-57 segmented negative-sense RNA viruses (NNSVs): Ebola (EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), Reston 58 (RESTV), Tai Forest (TAFV), Bundibugyo (BDBV), and Bombali (BOMV) viruses (Feldmann et 59 al., 2013, Kuhn, 2017, Goldstein et al., 2018). Among these, EBOV has caused the most 60 substantial outbreaks, along with SUDV and BDBV (Messaoudi et al., 2015). Once sporadic, 61 EBOV outbreaks have become increasingly frequent and large, as evidenced by the 62 unprecedented 2013-2016 West African epidemic and the 2017 and currently ongoing 63 outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (WHO, 2016, CDC, 2018). Even with 64 several promising therapeutic candidates under investigation, there remains no licensed 65 therapeutics available to prevent or treat infection (Keshwara et al., 2017, Cross et al., 2018, 66 Fanunza et al., 2018a). Thus, continued efforts to identify and develop therapeutics, particularly 67 those with pan-filovirus efficacy, should be a priority. 68 The ebolavirus genome is approximately 19 kb and encodes nine proteins, among which the 69 multifunctional virion protein 35 (VP35) is a major determinant of virulence and pathogenesis 70 (Leung et al., 2010b, Feldmann et al., 2013, Messaoudi et al., 2015). VP35 is a potent immune 71 antagonist, inhibiting interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) production, activation of the IFN-inducible protein 72 kinase R (PKR) antiviral protein, and RNA interference (Basler et al., 2000, Basler et al., 2003, 73 Feng et al., 2007, Schumann et al., 2009, Haasnoot et al., 2007, Fabozzi et al., 2011). VP35 74 inhibits retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor signaling and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production by 75 several mechanisms, including sequestering immunostimulatory double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) 76 intermediates, inhibiting PACT-induced RIG-I ATPase activity, preventing kinases TANK-binding 77 kinase 1 (TBK1), and/or IB kinase epsilon (IKK\u03b5) from activating interferon regulatory factors 3 78 and 7 (IRF3/IRF7), inactivating IRF7 by SUMOylation, and inhibiting TRIM6-mediated type I IFN 79 production (Cardenas et al., 2006, Bale et al., 2013, Dilley et al., 2017, Luthra et al., 2013, Prins 80 et al., 2009, Hartman et al., 2008, Chang et al., 2009, Bharaj et al., 2017).

As its name suggests, P protein is the most highly phosphorylated viral and Newcastle disease virus (NDV)(Qiu et al., 2016). However, it is unknown whether 116 the function of filovirus P protein is regulated by phosphorylation. Of note, although all P 117 proteins are thought to perform similar transcriptional and replication functions, there is 118 surprisingly little sequence homology, even between the Indiana and New Jersey serotypes of 119 VSV. EBOV VP35 is known to be moderately phosphorylated (Elliott et al., 1985, Prins et al., 120 2009).

We used affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to identify putative 123 post-translational modifications (PTMs) of VP35.

Data were averaged from at least two independent experiments. 280 The coordinates for the oligomerization domain of VP35 from Ebola virus were taken from the 282 RCSB Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000) as reported in the entry 6GBO.(Zinzula et al., 2832019a) The structure processing and optimization were carried out by means of Maestro Protein 284Preparation Wizard default setting (2018). Original water molecules were removed. After 285 preparation, the structure was refined to optimize the hydrogen bond network using OPLS_2005 286 force field.(Kaminski et al., 2001). S129A mutation was generated starting from VP35-WT. 287Therefore, the mutant geometry was optimized with a full minimization protocol considering 288 OPLS_2005 force field(Kaminski et al., 2001) and GB/SA implicit water, setting 10000 steps 289interactions analysis with Polak-Ribier Coniugate Gradient (PRCG) method and a convergence 290 criterion of 0.1 kcal/(mol\u00c5).Luciferase reporter gene assay for IFN promoter activation 292The luciferase reporter gene assay for IFN promoter activation was adapted from(Fanunza et  293   al., 2018b). HEK293T cells (1.5 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates 24 h before 294transfection. Cells were transfected using T-Pro P-Fect Transfection Reagent, according to the 295The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Plasmids pGL-IFN-\u03b2-luc (60 ng), pRL-TK (10 ng), and various dilutions 296 (100, 10, 1.0, 0.1, 0.01 ng) of pcDNA3 vector control (VC), pcDNA3_VP35-WT, or 297 pcDNA3_VP35-S129A were mixed with the transfection reagent in reduced serum medium 298Optimem (Gibco) and incubated 20 min at RT. Transfection complexes were then gently added 299into individual wells of the 96-well plate. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were 300 stimulated with influenza A virus (IAV)-RNA, pre-mixed with the transfection reagent in reduced 301 serum medium Optimem, and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO 2 . Cells were harvested with signal were normalized to Renilla luciferase, with percentage of IFN induction 310values calculated relative to unstimulated controls (indicated as 100%). Each assay was 311 performed in triplicate. Mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) values and paired, two-tailed t tests 312were calculated using GraphPad Prism 6.01 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.; San Diego, 313CA, USA). 314RT-PCR assay for ISG expression 315HEK293T cells (3 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well) resuspended Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 316",
