Here, we describe a novel approach for siRNA cellular delivery using siRNA encapsulated into liposomes additionally bearing arginine octamer (R8) molecules attached to their outer surface (R8-liposomes). The R8-liposomal human double minute gene 2 (HDM2)-siRNA demonstrated a significant stability against degradation in the blood serum (siRNA-loaded R8-liposomes remained intact even after 24-h incubation), and higher transfection efficiency into all three tested lung tumor cell lines. siRNA delivery successfully proceeds in the presence of plasma proteins, and R8-liposomes demonstrate low non-specific toxicity. The mechanism of action of R8-liposome-encapsulated siRNA is associated with the RNAi-mediated degradation of the target mRNA. siRNA in R8-liposomes effectively inhibited the targeted gene and significantly reduced the proliferation of cancer cells. The approach offers the potential for siRNA delivery for various in vitro and in vivo applications.",

The clinical use of siRNA is hindered by three major problems: (1) rapid enzymatic degradation resulting in a short half-life in the blood; (2) poor cellular uptake; (3) insufficient tissue bioavailability [2] [3] [4] . In general, these problems can be partly overcome by mixing siRNAs with cationic lipids or cationic polymers to form complexes, which could be additionally surface-modified with specific ligands allowing for targeting of required tissues [5] ; or by modifying siRNAs with cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), which have been successfully applied for the delivery of various cargoes into a variety of cells both in vitro and in vivo [6] [7] [8] [9] . However, these approaches frequently failed because of aggregation of siRNAcarrying positively charged complexes in the blood in the presence of plasma proteins, which results in unfavorable pharmacokinetics mainly due to the rapid uptake into the tissues of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) [10] .",

In particular, Lipofectamine2000 is frequently used for the delivery of siRNA [14, 15] . Despite the certain success using Lipoplexes, these agents allow for little control over the process of their interaction with siRNA leading to the final product, siRNA-lipoplex particle, of excessive size, low stability, and with incomplete encapsulation of siRNA molecules, which thereby exposes siRNA to potential enzymatic or physical degradation prior to delivery to cells. The complexes are sensitive towards serum, and therefore, optimal transfection must be performed using serum-free conditions, which has obvious shortcomings for potential in vivo applications. In addition, such complexes do not work efficiently with many cell types and are toxic to cells and experimental animals [16] .",

Various CPPs have been successfully used for the delivery of exogenous molecules, such as oligonucleotides and proteins, and even small particles, such as iron oxide nanoparticles, liposomes, and quantum dots, into the cytoplasm and nuclei of cultured cells [6] [7] [8] [9] 19 ]. Thus, DNA-loaded liposomes were delivered into various cells by multiple TAT peptide molecules attached to the liposome surface and allowed for the successful transfection with TAT-liposome-DNA complexes both in vitro and in vivo [20] . Synthetic oligo-arginines, such as 9-mer and 8mer (R8), were shown to be very effective CPPs [21] allowing, for example, for successful cell transfection with R8-luciferaseencoding plasmid complexes [22] .",

To address this question, gel-electrophoresis was used to determine the trace of siRNA. Two different dispersions were prepared with the same quantity of siRNA and lipids. One preparation was obtained as described above (R8-lipo-siRNA), while the other was obtained by mixing pre-formed cationic R8-liposomes with siRNA aqueous solution and termed R8-liposome-siRNA complex (Comp-R8-lipo-siRNA). Samples containing the same quantity of siRNA were loaded onto the gel, and electrophoresis performed with further visualization of siRNA bands by staining with ethidium bromide (Fig. 1e) . In case of Comp-R8-lipo-siRNA, all siRNA was released in a free form, resulting in a band with intensity close to the control-free siRNA (Fig. 1e, compare lanes 2 and 3) . For R8-lipo-siRNA, a band with much lower intensity compared to the control free siRNA was seen, however, after the treatment of the preparation with 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 10 min at 37\u00b0C, two siRNA bands were seen with intensity markedly brighter than before lysing (Fig. 1e, compare lanes 2, 4 and 5) , one band close to the loading position with much lower intensity compared to another one with intensity and position close to the control free siRNA. In addition, siRNA in the R8-lipo-siRNA preparations cannot be stained by ethidium bromide, suggesting that siRNA molecules were tightly coated by lipid membrane [26] . Based on the previous data [27, 28] and information presented here, we proposed the following mechanism for the assembly of R8-lipo-siRNA (Fig. 1f) . When the positively charged dry lipid film is hydrated with the aqueous solution containing 21 nt short double-stranded and strongly negatively charged RNA, two types of different forces act within the system: (1) electrostatic interaction between siRNA and the cationic polar heads of DOTAP drives the formation of inverted hexagonal structures entrapping single siRNA molecule, and (2) hydrophobic interaction between lipids resulting in the formation of a bilayered liposomal membrane, with PEG-PE preventing vesicles from aggregation. Heating the system induces the rearrangement of the lipid molecules and membranes to cover the surface of small inverted hexagonal micelles and arrange them to form a larger mosaic vesicle. A theoretical calculation further supports the above model. 21 nt siRNA can be considered as a rigid rod, 44 \u00c5 in diameter and 72 \u00c5 in length. The thickness of the lipid bilayer in egg PC vesicles is about 5-10 nm and varies with the acyl chain length [29] . The freeze-fracture EM shows that a small vesicle has a diameter of about 20 nm in diameter, indicating that the small vesicle represents a single siRNA molecule coated by a single lipid bilayer.",

After R8-lipo-siRNA lysis by SDS, however, the loaded siRNA was released from the liposomes, and all bands were seen with the intensity close to that of the control free siRNA except the mobility of all bands was slower than that of the free siRNA (Fig. 2d) . The fact that siRNA released from R8-lipo-siRNA by SDS had a slower mobility than free siRNA could be explained by possible interaction of SDS and serum components with siRNA released from R8-lipo-siRNA.

This system allows for very high transfection efficiency in all three types of tested lung tumor cells. The R8-liposomemediated transfection takes place even in the presence of plasma proteins. In addition, the system has a very low cytotoxicity. The HDM2-siRNAs-containing R8-liposomes were stable upon storage at 4\u00b0C with less than 10% release of siRNA after 3 months (data no shown). Gel electrophoresis demonstrated that electrophoretic behaviors of R8-lipo-siRNA were significantly different from the free siRNA and the Comp-R8-lipo-siRNA (Fig. 1e) , with much lower intensity compared to the free siRNA before lysing, however, after SDS lysing, two siRNA bands were seen with intensity markedly brighter than before lysing (Fig. 1e) , indicating that in this case most loaded siRNA was released in a free form. The new band close to the loading position should have a higher molecular weight than free siRNA or a lesser negative charge than free siRNA, which could reflect a complex of siRNA with few DOTAP molecules formed as a result of noncomplete liposome degradation by SDS or even a triple complex of negatively charged siRNA and SDS with DOTAP, since negatively charged SDS can form complexes with cationic lipids such as DOTAP in aqueous solutions. Lipid composition, size distribution, and surface charge of such liposomes can be easily manipulated to provide a clinically acceptable formulation for systemic delivery. In the process of formation of these liposomes, siRNA reacts with the head group of the liposomal DOTAP forming a neutral coordination complex. As a result, R8-lipo-siRNA have no or minimal charge. The reduction of the membrane surface charge is essential for improving the stability of siRNA-lipid formulations in the blood stream and decreasing the uptake by the reticulo-endothelial system [10] . In our study, we have confirmed that the mechanism of action of R8-liposomeencapsulated siRNA is determined by the RNAi-mediated degradation of the target mRNA. R8-lipo-HDM2-siRNA showed biological activity in SK-MES-1 cells, demonstrating the advantages of R8-liposome encapsulation of siRNA.",

The use of R8-liposomes as siRNA carriers is expected to overcome these problems by achieving three major goals: reduction of systemic toxicity, enhancement of the stability and circulation time of siRNA preparations in blood stream, and increase of siRNA permeation into cells. The same methodology may also prove to be useful for the encapsulation and delivery of other oligonucleotides.",
