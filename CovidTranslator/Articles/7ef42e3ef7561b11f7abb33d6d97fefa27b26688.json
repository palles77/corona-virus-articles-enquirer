Special attention is paid to cell receptors responding to exogenous dsRNA, pathways of dsRNA-dependent antiviral reaction, ability of dsRNA to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of malignant cells. It has been shown that enhancing the innate immune response with dsRNA can be an effective component in improving methods for treating and preventing infectious and cancer diseases. The further use of dsRNA for the correction of pathological processes of different origin is discussed.",

It is generally accepted that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) are one of the most important mediators of interferon (IFN) induction in response to viral infection. Viral infection is associated with the appearance in the cell of doublestranded forms of RNA, which either represent the actual viral genome of the virus or appear during the viral reproductive cycle [3] . The primary cascade of the body's response to viral infection and administration of exogenous dsRNA (recognition, initiation of intracellular signaling pathways) share many similarities, and therefore dsRNA may be considered as regulators of antiviral reactions [1] . However, subsequent studies of mechanisms of dsRNA action have shown that their functions are more diverse. In this regard, a constant interest in dsRNA as a substance for creation of new drugs for prevention and treatment of infectious and non-infectious diseases has not been waning for many years. This review summarizes current trends in the pharmaceutical development of drugs based on high-polymeric dsRNA.",

It has been found that the recognition of exogenous/extracellular dsRNA in the intracellular space can be performed using two main sensor systems [4] [5] [6] [7] . One sensor system includes receptors of the well-studied family of Toll-like receptors of type 3 (Toll-like receptor 3, TLR3) [8, 9] . The other sensor system includes the cytoplasmic sensors RIG-I/MDA-5/LGP2 of the RIG-like receptor family (RLR) [10, 11] . Both types of these systems are able to induce production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but the pathways for such activation differ.",

The structural basis for TLR3 interaction with dsRNA is the extracellular variable domain. The TLR3 ectodomain has a horseshoe shape; it contains N-and C-terminal leucine-rich repeat domains (LRR). The transmembrane domain consists of a single alpha helix. The cytoplasmic signaling domain contains a highly conserved sequence of approximately 200 residues homologous to the intracellular domain of the IL-1\u03b2 receptor, and therefore called the Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. This signaling domain is involved in the interaction of an activated receptor with adapter components of the intracellular signaling pathways.",

            "text": "It has been found that TLR3 dimerization and corresponding signal can be induced by dsRNA of at least 45\u221250 base pairs (bp); this corresponds to the minimum spatially possible distance between the sites of dsRNA binding with receptor ectodomain monomers [12, 13] . This feature provides receptor recognition of only long dsRNAs appearing in the cell as a result of viral infection; shorter polyribonucleotides (tRNA, rRNA, microRNA) are not able to form stable complexes with TLR3 ECD. The second characteristic feature of TLR3 consists in the receptor binding of the ligand that occurs via surface interactions (hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interaction) with the sugar-phosphate backbone of RNA, and not with individual nucleotide bases, and depends only on the secondary structure of RNA [12] . This explains the universality of the ligand-receptor interaction: the ability of the same receptor to bind dsRNA of different primary structure. On the other hand, there is evidence that TLR3 recognizes such specific ligand characteristics as the presence or absence of hydroxyl group at the 2'position of \u03b2-D-ribose, which discriminates dsRNA and DNA molecules [3, 12] . TLR3 is expressed mainly by specialized cells of the immune system, such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) [14] ; this receptor is also found on somatic cells [15, 16] . In most cell types, TLR3 is located inside the cell compartments-on the membranes of endosomes and lysosomes, although some cells, such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts, also express it on the plasma membrane outer surface [17, 18] . During endocytosis of dsRNA-containing material, intracellular TLR3 is able to move (by means of the UNC-93B protein) from the endoplasmic reticulum to endosomes, where they acquire functional ability for ligand recognition [19] .",

A key step in PKR activation is dsRNA binding to two structurally similar N-terminal motifs of the enzyme molecule, dsRBM1 and dsRBM2, followed by subsequent PKR autophosphorylation. After activation PKR phosphorylates a number of proteins, including alpha subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2); this has important consequences for the cell cycle. Phosphorylated eIF-2 binds to eIF-2B, thus causing the inhibition of the eIF-2B catalyzed reaction and protein synthesis (Fig. 2) [27] .

Unlike PKR, OAS does not have a separate domain for binding an inducer. dsRNA binds in the region of the positively charged groove of the enzyme; after conformational changes of the groove the OAS active center becomes spatially accessible. The activated enzyme DANILENKO et al. catalyzes ATP polymerization resulted in formation of short mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-oligoadenylates (2\u2032, 5\u2032-oligoA), which interact with RNase L (RNase L) and transform it from an inactive monomeric form to the active dimer (Fig. 2) . RNase L, a protein with molecular mass of 83 kDa, consists of three domains: N-terminal regulatory domain, which contains nine ankyrin-like regions, protein kinase-like domain, and C-terminal RNase domain. 2'-5'A oligomers interact with the ankyrin-like sites of the RNase L N-terminal domain. The complex formation is accompanied by conformational changes, leading to dimerization of the enzyme molecule and the C-terminal ribonuclease domain becomes catalytically active. Destroying mRNA into fragments, RNase L suppresses formation of complete viral RNA, which leads to inhibition of both protein synthesis and assembly of viral particles [28, 29] . Thus, both OAS and PKR are dsRNAdependent enzymes and become active only in the presence of dsRNA. This fact indicates an important role of dsRNA as markers of viral infection and triggers of the intracellular antiviral reaction.",

Induction of TLR3-dependent cell signaling pathways in response to exposure to dsRNA. Binding of extracellular dsRNA or dsRNA absorbed during endocytosis or phagocytosis to TLR3 leads to receptor phosphorylation and binding to the adapter molecule TRIF, which serves as a platform for assembly of proteins involved in triggering signaling pathways leading to activation of IRF-3 (7) or NF-\u03baB. In the case of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, activated TRIF interacts with TRAF6, after oligomerization the latter acquires ubiquitin-E3-ligase activity, causing ubiquitination of both TRAF6 and RIP1 protein. The polyubiquitin sequence is recognized by the TAK1-binding proteins TAB2 and TAB3, which promote TAK1 kinase binding to the complex. RIP1 with attached ubiquitin molecules is recognized by NEMO, resulted in IKK complex binding to the TRIF-RIP1-TRAF6-TAB-TAK1 complex. TAK1 phosphorylates the IKKb subunit of the IKK complex, promoting its activation. Phosphorylated IkB binds to ubiquitin undergoes proteasomal degradation with release of NF-\u03baB, which migrates into the nucleus, where it binds to the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. For activation of the IRF-3 (7) pathway TRAF3 binds to TANK or NAP1 and SINTBAD peptides, which, in turn, interact with TBK-1 and/or IKK\u03b5; their activated forms are able to phosphorylate IRF-3. Activation of the factor IRF-7 occurs similarly. In the nucleus, activated IRFs bind in the region of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter with NF-\u03baB and ATF-2/c-jun, resulting in the involvement of cofactors and RNA polymerase II and initiation of transcription.

In order to avoid such undesirable reactions, Hafner et al. proposed an original PolyI:PolyC delivery system [103] . The microcarrier is a negatively charged polystyrene microsphere equipped with a \"crown\" of polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is formed by electrostatic coating with polycationic copolymers based on poly(L-lysine)-graft-poly(ethylene glycol). Experiments on primary culture of peripheral blood monocytes have shown that PolyI:PolyC adsorbed on the surface of the microspheres caused activation of monocyte-derived DC [103] . At the same time, the preparation drug did not affect expression of antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or secretion of IL-6 by human skin fibroblasts and weakened their phagocytic activity; this indicates that the adsorbed PolyI:PolyC lacks the ability to induce adverse inflammatory reactions [104] .",

In groups of mice immunized with liposomes carrying the P5 protein and PolyI:PolyC, as well as liposomes containing only PolyI:PolyC, a more significant level of IFN-\u03b3 secretion by splenocytes and an increase in the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells compared with other groups were observed. The most pronounced inhibition of the growth of the experimental TUBO tumor with a high level of rHER2/neu expression during the whole experiment (90 days) was observed during treatment with liposomes containing P5 and PolyI:PolyC.
