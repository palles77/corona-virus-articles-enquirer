The goals of infectious disease surveillance are threefold: (1) to describe the current burden and epidemiology of disease, (2) to monitor trends, and (3) to identify outbreaks and new pathogens. First, describing the burden and epidemiology (including seasonality, age distribution, age groups, etc.) of disease is critical for demonstrating the need and advocating for interventions, such as vaccination and mass drug administration. Surveillance is also used to detect antimicrobial resistance in certain pathogens (for example, fluoroquinolone resistance in gonorrhea) and the circulating strains of disease, which helps target vaccine interventions (for example, annual influenza vaccine composition).",

Epidemic meningococcal disease in the meningitis belt in Africa requires ongoing surveillance to identify outbreaks in the region. Cholera surveillance is maintained globally to detect outbreaks and requires mandatory reporting to the World Health Organization (WHO). Emerging and reemerging diseases also pose a big risk to public health. These diseases include both unknown pathogens that appear for the first time in a population as well as known pathogens that increase in geographic spread or severity or are reintroduced into the population.

This may involve calling or visiting health facilities to encourage follow-up or having staff review medical records to identify cases meeting prescribed case definitions.

Countries mandate which diseases are notifiable, many of which are infectious diseases. Globally, the WHO, as described in the International Health Regulations, defines what is notifiable by every country to WHO, such as MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and Ebola. Nationally notifiable diseases depend on the country. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists compile a list of diseases that have mandated reporting to the CDC. These include foodborne and sexually transmitted infections, other infectious diseases such as dengue, malaria, and HIV, and noncommunicable diseases such as cancer. The list is updated every year.

Within this network, staff are engaged to work specifically on finding all cases meeting the case definition at the sites. Cases are enrolled into surveillance after they have been admitted to the medical facility. A case report form, filled out by the dedicated staff member, details their clinical symptoms. Laboratory testing is done at the hospital for initial diagnosis or at a national or regional reference laboratory to monitor for trends in culture positivity and serotype/serogroup incidence.

How outbreak prone is the disease? Cases of infectious disease can be identified at medical facilities (hospitals and outpatient clinics) or in the community. The location of individuals enrolled into surveillance can vary based on clinical presentation of disease and access to health care. More severe cases of disease can often be identified at hospitals. Hospitalized cases are those that are severe enough to be admitted to the hospital for treatment and have the resources to seek care. Hospitalized cases can be enrolled prospectively or retrospectively when a case report form is filled out based on their medical chart. Identifying cases in hospitals can be easier than identifying cases in the community, but the cases may only represent a small proportion of cases and miss cases that do not seek health care. An example of hospital-based surveillance is severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance for influenza. For diseases like Ebola, where fear in the community might prevent cases from going to seek health care, hospital surveillance would be insufficient alone. Individuals with milder cases of disease may also seek medical care, such as at outpatient clinics, so surveillance may be conducted at medical facilities outside of hospitals, such as with influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance.",

This type of surveillance aims to capture cases beyond those that are admitted to a health facility, therefore enrolling a wide range of disease severity and access to medical care. Community-based surveillance is useful for surveying diseases targeted for eradication because all cases must be traced and is not limited to those severe enough to be admitted to a hospital or those that have access to a health-care facility. Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance is an active surveillance network that aims to identify every case of polio, which is currently targeted for eradication. Suspect cases are sought in the community and at health facilities to identify any unreported cases. This type of surveillance was also a method used in the Ebola virus disease epidemic of 2014-15. Community members and volunteers would report individuals with symptoms meeting the case definition for Ebola, who would then be visited by health personnel for testing. Community-based surveillance was supplemented by contact tracing, where individuals who had been in contact with confirmed Ebola patients were sought out in the community and monitored for symptoms.",

Sentinel site surveillance provides useful epidemiological information on proportions caused by different pathogens, age distribution, and risk factors and could also be used for monitoring trends of hospitalized cases within a health facility if health-care patterns and population have been stable.

Initially, when the United Nations (UN) development goals were established in 1990, measles was endemic in many countries, and mortality reduction was the primary goal. Given this, aggregate data were the most feasible approach and were conducted in most countries. By 2016, all six WHO regions have measles elimination goals. As measles has moved away from control and toward elimination, case-based surveillance is needed to ensure every case is reported and investigated. When disease was endemic, case-based surveillance would quickly be overwhelmed given the time and resources, but as countries have fewer and fewer cases, it is relatively easier to conduct an investigation on every single case. WHO recommends the type of data to be collected in an investigation. One key advantage of case-based surveillance is that it allows one to analyze which age cohorts are being infected and their individual vaccination status to help to target vaccination efforts and close existing immunity gaps.",

Specific case definitions have stricter criteria and exclude more patients that do not have the disease but can also miss patients with milder or atypical disease presentations. Both sensitive and specific case definitions can be used in infectious disease surveillance depending on the goals of surveillance. For example, sensitive case definitions may be preferred if it is important not to miss cases. In general, case definitions should be as sensitive and specific as possible.

The fever and rash could be due to a multitude of causes, and if there is an increase in the number of fever/rash cases reported, this could indicate an outbreak. As field investigations are ongoing, laboratory testing can be performed on some or all of the cases identified by syndromic surveillance to determine the etiology. In the acute fever/rash surveillance system, laboratory specimens might be collected to undergo testing for measles and rubella. A wellestablished global WHO-coordinated measles laboratory network provides support to monitoring measles cases and provide genotype information globally. Syndromic surveillance case definitions can be used in emergency or outbreak situations as an alert system to identify suspect cases that meet a broad case definition to then be further investigated.

Vaccine impact studies can use surveillance to demonstrate reduction of disease after introducing an intervention such as a vaccine. These impact studies require baseline data before the vaccine was introduced in order to compare the postvaccine era to the prevaccine introduction disease incidence. Special studies that gather additional information may complement surveillance disease trends. Vaccine effectiveness studies evaluate the ability of a vaccine to control the disease in a real-world setting, which differs from vaccine efficacy studies where the vaccine impact is estimated in a controlled clinical situation. A good example of this is rotavirus diarrheal sentinel site surveillance, which has been used both to show the decline in rotavirus disease among age groups vaccinated as part of routine immunization and has also been used as a platform to conduct vaccine effectiveness studies.",

In these situations, models using local and nonlocal data can be very useful. In addition to data from one region being extrapolated to inform on the disease within that region, data from similar regions can also be used to fill in gaps where surveillance is missing. There are many global burden estimation projects updated regularly to give global prevalence and mortality estimates by different government, research, and academic groups for a number of diseases (for example, influenza, S. pneumoniae, and rotavirus). Burden estimation modeling can also be done on the national level using surveillance data collected locally.
