            "text": "Cardenolides are plant-derived toxic substances. Their cytotoxicity and the underlying mechanistic signaling axes have been extensively documented, but only a few anti-viral activities of cardenolides and the associated signaling pathways have been reported. Previously, we reported that a variety of cardenolides impart antitransmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) activity in swine testicular (ST) cells, through targeting of the cell membrane sodium/potassium pump, Na + /K + -ATPase. Herein, we further explore the potential signaling cascades associated with this anti-TGEV activity in ST cells. Ouabain, a representative cardenolide, was found to potently diminish TGEV titers and inhibit the TGEV-induced production of IL-6 in a dose dependent manner, with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 37 nM and 23 nM respectively. By pharmacological inhibition and gene silencing, we demonstrated that PI3K_PDK1_RSK2 signaling was induced in TGEV-infected ST cells, and ouabain imparted a degree of anti-TGEV activity via further augmentation of this existing PI3K_PDK1 axis signaling, in a manner dependent upon its association with the Na + /K + -ATPase. Finally, inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 or PDK1 by BX795 antagonized the anti-viral activity of ouabain and restored the TGEV virus titer and yields. This finding is the first report of a PI3K_PDK1 signaling axis further induced by ouabain and implicated in the suppression of TGEV activity and replication; greatly illuminates the underlying mechanism of cardenolide toxicity; and is expected to result in one or more anti-viral applications for the cardenolides in the future.

The Taiwan field isolated virulent strain of TGEV was propagated in ST cells cultured with MEM and 2% FBS. IFA and studies on the mechanistic signaling effectors regarding ouabain and the other pharmacological inhibitors in TGEV infected ST cells were performed as described (Yang et al., 2017a; Yang et al., 2017b) . Briefly, the ST cells in 96-well plates, with or without pretreatment of test compounds, were infected with TGEV at an MOI of 7. After 6 h of TGEV infection, ST cells were fixed and subjected to an indirect IFA with antibodies against the S and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of TGEV. The cells were treated with eight different concentrations of test compounds. The resultant cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Cappel, ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.) and the fluorescence intensities were measured to determine the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) for inhibiting S and N protein expression. The results of these assays were used to obtain the dose-response curves from which IC 50 s were determined.",

The anti-TGEV IC 50 value of ouabain (IC 50 = 143 \u00b1 13 nM) increased in the presence of 50 \u03bcM or 100 \u03bcM LY294002 (IC 50 = 171 \u00b1 23 nM and IC 50 = 182 \u00b1 30 nM respectively), and the inhibition curve exhibited a significant right-shift in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. 3A) .

TGEV infection induced Akt phosphorylation, and ouabain treatment further augmented this Akt phosphorylation. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 eliminated both TGEV induced and ouabain enhanced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 3B ). Ouabain has been reported to bind to Na + / K + -ATPase and resulted in recruitment for Na + /K + -ATPase associated signalsome, which in turn triggered signaling for the pharmacological effects of ouabain (Liu et al., 2007; Nguyen et al., 2011) . This was supported by the observation that treatment with LY294002 inhibited the ouabain associated PI3K activation, as demonstrated by abolishing Akt phosphorylation; and rescued the TGEV N protein expression level an indication of TGEV proliferation (Fig. 3B & C) .",

PDK1 activation mediated by ouabain enhanced PI3K activation was associated with Na + /K + -ATPase and contributed to anti-TGEV activity A pharmacological inhibition strategy was used to examine the involvement of Akt, mTOR, and PDK1 (the downstream signaling cascades of PI3K) in the anti-TGEV activity of ouabain (Fig. 4A-B-C) . Two doses of ouabain, 200 nM and 150 nM, close to its IC 50 value (143 \u00b1 13 nM) determined by IFA (Fig. 3A) , were then used for the following studies (Figs. 4 and 5) . The Akt inhibitor triciribine was able to inhibit Akt phosphorylation, but failed to rescue the diminished N protein expression by ouabain, as had been accomplished with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 4A) . Similarly, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was able to diminish the p70S6K phosphorylation, but failed to reverse the inhibited N protein expression by ouabain (Fig. 4B) . Only the PDK1 inhibitor BX795 was able to reverse the ouabain-inhibited TGEV N protein expression. While ouabain treatment increased RSK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C) , RSK1 phosphorylation was not significantly affected (data not shown). Treatment with BX795 inhibited the phosphorylation of PDK1 downstream effector RSK2 (Hao et al., 2016; No et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2017; Utepbergenov et al., 2016) (Fig. 4C) .",

            "text": "Additionally, although Src associated PI3K-Akt and PI3K-mTOR signaling cascades were reported to be responsible for the biological effects of the cardenolides in cardiac (Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008) and cancer cells (Tian et al., 2009) respectively, ouabain also activates the Na + /K + -ATPase associated PI3K1A signaling, which is Src independent (Wu et al., 2013) . Therefore, we further examined the downstream effectors of PI3K, Akt, mTOR, and PDK1, and found that only the PDK1 inhibitor BX795 was able to reverse the anti-TGEV activity of ouabain (Fig. 4) . When Na + /K + -ATPase, not PI3K or PDK1, was knocked down in ST cells, a significant amount of N protein expression was suppressed, reflecting a decrease in virus infectivity. However, when PI3K or PDK1 was knocked down in ST cells, these cells became more resistant to ouabain treatment than control shRNA harboring ST cells, reflecting a reverse in virus infectivity (Fig. 5) . Finally, combination treatments of either LY294002 or BX795 with ouabain successfully reversed the activity of the ouabain, and increased TGEV titers (Fig. 6) .",

These fundamental mechanistic insights are expected to contribute to future applications of anti-viral cardenolides. Fig. 6 . Ouabain eliminated TGEV titers via augmenting a Na + /K + -ATPase dependent PI3K_PDK1 axis. Combined treatment of either LY294002 or BX795 with ouabain significantly rescued the TGEV replication/titers inhibited by ouabain. ST cells were pretreated with the indicated compounds for 1 h, and then infected with TGEV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. The resultant cultured medium was harvested at 22 h.p.i. and subjected to determining virus titers by an end-point assay as described in Materials and Methods. *, P < .05; **, P < .01. Results shown are averages \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments.",

ST cells were induced to produce a large quantity of IL-6 upon TGEV infection at MOI of 0.01 over a period of 30 h.p.i. The resultant culture supernatant of TGEV infected ST cells at each indicated time point was subjected to quantification of IL-6. B. IL-6 production in TGEV infected ST cells was significantly diminished by ouabain in a dose dependent manner. Ouabain was pretreated for 1 h prior to ST cells infected with TGEV at a MOI of 0.01. The resultant culture supernatants of ouabain treated cells at the 22 h.p.i. were subjected to quantification of IL-6. Results shown are averages \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments.",
