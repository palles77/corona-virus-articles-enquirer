This is the second most deadly EVD outbreak in history, after the one that occurred in West Africa in 2014. The DRC Ministry of Health (MoH), supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and a range of regional and international partners, are implementing EVD response plans in these affected areas such as screening of suspect cases at points of entry, case detection, contact tracing, laboratory testing, case management and infection prevention and control, safe and dignified burials, ring vaccination (this involves vaccination of infected individuals, direct contacts of infected individuals and contacts of their contacts), and therapeutics, community mobilization and free access to healthcare services. Despite these efforts, there has been a sharp rise in the number of confirmed cases within the identified affected areas, and due to a number of challenges unique to DRC, there has been an expansion in the geographical extent of transmission. The significance of the proximity of these regions to wildlife and the Virunga National Park is questionable in the EVD transmission dynamics. The close interaction between human, animal, and environmental factors, in combination with high population movement due to regular rebel attacks in these regions, suggest the need for the integration of the One Health approach in the holistic response plans for control and prevention of EVD. This paper seeks to highlight the implications and importance of a One Health-based approach into the infectious diseases control program implementation in DRC.",

This outbreak is currently ongoing in the North-Kivu and Ituri provinces of DRC. Previous outbreaks in DRC occurred in remote and hard-to-reach areas, while the ongoing outbreak is occurring in urban environments. Furthermore, there are other unique challenges during this outbreak, such as community resistance and security issues due to the epicentre being in a conflict zone. In the history of EVD outbreaks, this has been the second most deadly after the one that occurred in West Africa in 2014. The DRC is located in central Africa, neighboring with nine countries (Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia). A majority of the population from North-Kivu and Ituri provinces travel for trade and business between their neighboring countries in the East (Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda). Hence, controlling the outbreak in those two proviences would prevent its spread to these countries.",

Most of these cases have been reported in the community, however a few cases have also been reported in healthcare settings [9] . The DRC Ministry of Health (MoH), supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and a range of regional and international partners are implementing EVD response plans in these affected areas. A package of interventions, such as screening of suspect cases at points of entry, case detection, contact tracing, laboratory testing, case management and infection prevention and control, safe and dignified burials, ring vaccination (This involved vaccination of infected individuals; direct contacts of infected individuals, and contacts of those contacts); and therapeutics, laboratory facilities with capacity for EVD confirmatory testing, safe and dignified burials, community mobilization, and free access to healthcare services, have been used for containing and eliminating this deadly disease [10, 11] . Conducting contacts tracing and early symptoms detection in this unstable setting remains a challenge. The population is highly mobile with individuals often hiding, refusing to subject themselves to follow-up examinations, or traveling to distant homes in heavily forested areas and other destinations [5] . The rVSV-ZEBOV experimental vaccine has been offered to healthcare and frontline workers, case contacts, and contacts of contacts, and the GeneXpert diagnostic test tool has been introduced for rapid diagnosis of the Zaire strain of EVD [9, 12, 13] . From 8 August 2018 to 22 July 2019, 171,052 people have been vaccinated using the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine with an efficacy of 97.5% according to the WHO [5, 14] .

The global economy has enabled the rapid spread of people, animals, plants, and agricultural products across the world. This mobility has contributed to more frequent outbreaks of zoonotic diseases and infections of uninformed populations. Improved coordination among key ministries (health, livestock, fisheries, wildlife, environment, disaster response, and partners) guided by the One Health approach is necessary to match responses to disease ecology [22, 23] . This is done by conducting in-depth joint outbreak investigations and response activities by establishing a One Health coordination unit. This unit should bridge the animal and human health sectors by deploying an epidemiologist from each ministry in order to maintain collaboration at the animal and human health interface with the goal of better prevention and control of zoonosis. Furthermore, an ecologist should be added to the unit to ensure that environmental risks are adequately addressed in emerging disease control. Such collaboration has been applied successfully in other countries such as Kenya [24] and India [25] by applying a One Health-based approach for controlling diseases.",

In addition, new tools such as mathematical modeling, remote sensing, and ecologically based approaches are also important [30] . Mathematical models can project how infectious diseases progress to show the likely outcome of an epidemic and help inform public health interventions. Models use some basic assumptions and mathematics to find parameters for various infectious diseases and use those parameters to calculate the effects of possible interventions, such as mass vaccination programs. Research that applies an environmental approach to emerging viral diseases is particularly complex. Remote sensing data enable scientists to study the earth's biotic and abiotic components. The causes underlying the rise of disease are at the macro (socio-cultural) and micro (cellular and molecular) levels, but they are indeed acting over individuals, populations, and communities. There are several lines of evidence on the relationship between natural ecosystems' intervention and re/emergence of diseases produced by bacteria, parasites and viruses. Specifically, in order to understand viral emergence it is important to understand the sylvatic cycle of viruses, the transition to human populations, the relationship between vectors, pathogens and reservoirs in wildlife ecosystems, the change in the distribution of vectors and reservoirs after natural habitat fragmentation, and how these conditions are generating potential new roles and ecological niches for species. Wild ecosystems historically disturbed by agricultural and industrial activities with changes in biotic and abiotic factors (water bodies distribution, soil profiles, plant coverage, breeding microclimate, vertebrate and invertebrate populations, etc.), constitute new selective pressures for pathogens and therefore new opportunities for adaptation. It allows vectors/reservoirs to exploit the new resources, favouring viral contact with potentially new host populations (e.g. humans) [31] . From all these aspects, the integrated approach of One Health shows its usefulness in controlling re-emerging infectious diseases.",
