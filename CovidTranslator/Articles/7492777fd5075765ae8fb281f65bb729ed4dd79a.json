            "text": "The world's most populous country (population 1.35 billion), with its second largest economy, makes the scale of e-government there of significant interest. China emerged from a period of international isolation in the late 20th century to become an economic and political behemoth. Fueled by an influx of foreign direct investment (FDI), it is the world's largest producer of steel, cement, textiles, electronics, toys, and numerous other products. It has enjoyed rapid rates of growth, averaging 7% annually, for decades, a process that has created a vast middle class with considerable purchasing power. Most of this growth has been concentrated along the Pacific Coast, leaving large parts of the interior underdeveloped. Half of China now lives in cities, which are often congested and suffer severe air pollution problems. The government is renowned worldwide for the severity of its oppression, censorship, corruption, and lack of human rights and democratic reforms. Digital technologies and telecommunications have formed an integral part of the country's transition from socialism into an increasingly prosperous, globalized, and devoutly capitalist society. Since then, Damm (2007) notes, rising Internet penetration accompanied the development of a consumerist culture, increasingly severe social fragmentation, and a growing interest in identity politics. The state has long viewed information technology as essential to productivity growth and national competitiveness. For this reason, China's ventures into e-government have attracted considerable attention (Yong, 2003; Holliday and Yep, 2005; Ma et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2009; Zhao, 2010; Yang et al., 2012; Schlaeger, 2013) . In 2016, China's Internet penetration rate was 52.3%; its 721 million netizens are the largest such national population in the world. In 2015, China's e-government readiness score was 0.5359, higher than most countries in the developing world but below that of the industrialized world. E-participation stood at a remarkably low 0.2105, indicating that the government's initiatives to construct e-government have outpaced most people's ability to utilize it. Since the 1990s, e-government may simultaneously reinforce but perhaps also challenge the prevailing power relations that run through the state. Such comments indicate that e-government in dictatorial one-party states such as China differs markedly from that of democratic Asian states such as Japan or South Korea.",

            "text": "China's e-government approaches arose haphazardly and were badly fragmented by competing public bureaucracies. Deng Xiaoping noted that informatization would be a key part of national development in 1984. In Chinese, the term \"e-government\" (dianzi zhengwu) typically refers to government web applications, whereas \"informatization\" (xinxihua) refers to the broader ranges of information technology applications. Key to this strategy was the notion of technological leapfrogging and a perhaps exaggerated emphasis on information technology as the means to catch up with, or surpass, the West. Since then, the national government has spent more than 1 trillion yuan ($120 billion) on e-government and initiated wave upon wave of projects to encourage its growth and use. In many respects China's strategy sought to emulate the success of e-government in Western countries (Zhang, 2006) , albeit tailoring it to the specific context of one-party authoritarian rule. Not only has e-government become widespread but also its use has shifted gradually from simple acquisition of information online to interactive services such as tax and bill payments and license registration.",

            "text": "Successive 5-year plans have trumpeted the need for developing and using a sophisticated information technology network. The first formal implementation occurred in 1994 (Chen et al., 2006) , or roughly 15 years after the initiation of Deng Xiaoping's reforms that liberalized the economy and reintegrated China into the world system, although the CANet and the Institute of High Energy Physics network had undertaken steps even earlier. Fudan University, Tsinghua University, and Shanghai Jiaotong University were the first academic institutions to become directly connected to the Internet. In 1993, the State Education Commission formed the CERNET to link all the country's universities. Government websites grew rapidly, and comprise about 4.3% of all of those in the .CN domain (Zhau, 2004) . The government is by far the largest owner of information resources in the country, with more than 3000 databases. By 2006, online portals were found in 100%, 93%, and 69% of provincial, city, and county government offices, respectively. An administrative structure to guide the growth of e-government was clearly needed. As Zhang (2002, p. 169) notes, \"the origin of Chinese e-government can be traced to the establishment of the Joint Committee of National Economic Informatization in 1993.\" In 1996, it set up the State Council Informatization Leading Group, the nucleus of what would become the Ministry of Information Industry (MII), which has supervised subsequent developments.",

            "text": "In the 1990s, the Chinese government launched a series of parallel projects, which became the early core of e-government, collectively known as \"the Goldens,\" as all contained the word in their title. The Golden Bridge (jin w\u01cengqi\u00e1o) project, which started in 1993, sought to link public and private networks by building a national infrastructure backbone of fiber-optic lines. The Golden Card (jin ka) project was aimed at fostering a national credit card system, unified payments system, and e-banking, a response to the country's fragmented banking system that often makes it difficult to clear transactions. More than 200 million cards were handed out in the next decade. It also encouraged the growth of ATMs and point-of-sale terminal networks. The Golden Bridge (jin qiao) focused on providing commercial Internet service to corporate clients, creating the infrastructure over which other networks would run. The Golden Customs or Gate (jin guan) project sought to connect foreign investors with banks and the customs department using electronic data interchange (EDI) (Holliday and Yep, 2005) , which was also a means of curtailing smuggling and enhancing tariff revenues (which rose 22% in one year). The motive behind the Golden projects was to \"unify the country by tying the center to the provinces and by allowing the government to act across ministerial and industrial demarcation lines\" (Zhang, 2002, p. 170) . Other Golden projects included Golden Sea or Golden Macro (jin hong, to set up centralized, networked databases on prices, investments, and resources to enable government bodies to communicate better regarding economic policy), Golden Taxation (jin shui, to enable banks to direct funds across the country and minimize tax fraud by adding digital codes to receipt to allow computers to compare sellers' declared revenues and buyers' expenses), Golden Intelligence (jin zhi, to allow teachers and researchers access to databases), Golden Agriculture (jin nong, to monitor agricultural supervisory committees and forecasting), Golden Enterprises (jin qi, to link 12,000 small-and medium-sized enterprises), Golden Health (jin wei, to distribute information technology to the medical community and encourage long-distance sharing of health information), Golden Housing (jin jia, to form a national property database), Golden Water (jin shu\u01d0, to create a national database used for water conservation), Golden Cellular (jin feng, to develop a national mobile phone system with roaming standards), Golden Trade (jin sh\u0101ngy\u00e8, to promote e-commerce and intellectual property), Golden Finance (jin j\u012bnr\u00f3ng, to enhance the management of national financial revenues), Golden Social Security (jin bao, to note changes in the national labor market), Golden Switch (jin ji\u0101ohu\u00e0nj\u012b, to accelerate domestic projection of digital switching technology), and Golden Audit (jin shen, to create a centralized auditing system). These grandiose visions were remarkably limited in scope, each to a prevailing sector of the state (Table 3 .1). In 1999, the Goldens were followed by a second state initiative, the Government Online Project (Zhengfu Shangwang Gongcheng), which sought to put most government functions onto the web, a strategy designed in part to overcome the sectoral differences of the various Golden projects. It was sponsored by China Telecomm, which saw an opportunity to lease its lines to government offices and thus subsidize website development, and more than 40 central government departments. Its website (http://www.gov.cn) was designed as the model for other public webpages to emulate. The initiative unfolded in three steps: first, to connect government offices to the Internet; second, to establish interagency compatibility; and third, still in the making, to make these agencies paperless. It focused on putting government documents on the web; promoted online databases, welfare payments, and bidding for government contracts; and sought to connect 80% of government agencies within a year (later this was postponed until 2005). One element, the National Population Information Network, sought to provide police departments with digitally collected information about all citizens older than 16 years, ostensibly as an aid to recapture escaped prisoners. The project offered guidelines, incentives, promotional resources, and informational centers, and was implemented on a trial basis in 100 cities. Government Online also encouraged active collaboration between the state and private information technology producers, including hardware and software manufacturers. It also drew advertising revenues from foreign and domestic firms (e.g., Microsoft, IBM, and Cisco). By the government's modest standards, the project was reasonably successful: within 2 years, 80% of government agencies had established websites, including numerous ministries (Agriculture, Culture, Labor, Railways, Foreign Affairs, etc.), national bureaus (Sports, Forestry, Surveying, Tobacco, Weather, etc.), (Luo, 2009 ). Government Online was followed by Enterprise Online, focused on e-commerce. In 1998, China's first government-to-business e-commerce website was established in Xiamen, which allowed government purchases to be tracked online. Enterprise Online, which started in 2000, was largely aimed at 1 million small-and medium-sized enterprises, and some large state-owned corporations. The initial stages encouraged the use of email and participation in online trade fairs. Subsequent ones sought digitized information on supply chains, Internet-based accounting and inventory control, and the creation of value-added services. However, many state-owned enterprises are averse to conducting e-business. The state's encouragement of economic activity online recognized that successful e-commerce requires a payment system that is convenient and secure. Finally, the state also planned a Households Online project, although the rapid growth of Internet usage driven by the private sector has largely rendered it obsolete.",

Indeed, e-government is central to the effort to decentralize the tasks of public administration, and, paradoxically, to enhance the central government's oversight (Ma et al., 2005) . The formal reasons for implementing e-government include attempts to transform the nature of government functions (i.e., clearly delineate agencies' obligations and duties), reengineer the structure of the state to become more lean and mean, and enhance transparency, openness, and responsiveness. Broadly, the intended result was to shift away from direct supervision of local agencies and publicize their functions and duties. The e-government campaign to reduce corruption aimed at diminishing the role of informal ties, i.e., guanxi, and the kickbacks that are a common part of the operation of the Chinese state. In 2013, the Ministry of Supervision received 15,253 online reports from citizens about government officials' malfeasance and negligence (Zhao et al., 2015) .",

Access to e-government requires access to the Internet, which is increasingly difficult to control. This tension reflects the broader conflict throughout China between the older, nationalist center of power concerned with retaining its monopoly over information and the newer, privatized, and globalized centers that tolerate diverse flows of information. In short, China wants to promote and rein in the Internet simultaneously. This contradiction plays out in the implementation of e-government among the country's counties and cities. Seifert and Chung (2009) hold that whereas e-government in the United States was designed to inject business principles into governance and make the state more citizen centered, in China it is aimed largely at enhancing the central state's scrutiny of cities, in which bureaucrats in Beijing can keep track of municipal taxes, contracts, and expenditures.",

E-government is not synonymous with democratization. Enhancing citizen power is feasible in well-established democracies with an independent media, but e-government can hardly be expected to perform such a role in one-party systems such as China, with its abysmal record of human rights, censorship, and authoritarian control. Even the goal of reducing corruption through e-government has been implemented more with an eye toward creating a good business climate for investors than promoting democratic governance.",

At the municipal level, wide variations exist in the degree to which e-government initiatives have been adopted in Chinese cities (Lu et al., 2007; Fan and Luo, 2013) . Whereas national e-government directives were delivered in top-down fashion from Beijing, at the local level these emerged more organically and unevenly. Inevitably, because information technologies are wrapped up with various configurations of power, the introduction of such measures changed the relative power of the central and local state (Schlaeger, 2013) . Local governments are granted considerable autonomy in the degree to which they may implement e-government measures, with wide variations in the quality of websites and services (Shi, 2007) . Some have reacted defensively out of fear that local corruption and mismanagement will be exposed. Others have very well-developed Internet infrastructures, with widespread broadband use. Not surprisingly, prosperous and globalized cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Shenzen have taken the lead (Tan, 2013).",

In 1998, in a vast undertaking overseen by the Shanghai Municipal Informatization Commission, the city began an all-inclusive digital social security smart card system that accesses a centralized database containing detailed personal information about holders (including fingerprints and medical insurance account numbers) (Lili Cui et al., 2006) . Four types of cards are issued: blue, for users older than 16 years; red, for those older than 70 years; golden, for retired officials; and green, for students younger than 16 years. Users can access terminals in a variety of places, including hospitals and government offices, and through them can perform numerous functions: apply for home loans and drivers' licenses; register employment status, marriages, and divorces; apply for unemployment subsidies; make housing payments; and claim medical expenses. The project proceeded in three stages: the first, starting in 1998, brought together a project team and developed the infrastructure and regulatory framework, and publicized it to the city's residents. The second, in 2001, laid down guiding principles and practices, detailed the roles of different agencies, and initiated training programs. The third, beginning in 2003, popularized the cards and began mass dissemination. By 2005, more than 9.3 million cards were used by 70% of the target population. Careful planning went into this project, which drew on local pools of engineers to provide technical support. Partnerships between the city's public and private sectors were established. The city's e-government services have become indispensable for firms operating there.",

It was the first Chinese city to initiate an online office work system for public employees. In 1999, it fostered the Digital Beijing project, including the Capital Public Information Platform (Shoudu Gongyong Xinxi Pingtai), which offers access to databases about population, traffic flows, and public offices, and allows civil service examinations to be taken online. The Zhongguancun Park of Science and Technology, which began in 2000 in northwest Beijing and grew to include 6000 corporate tenants, streamlined its administrative procedures through its Haidian Digital Park, through which firms can file statistics, taxes, and financial reports through a \"one-stop shop\" portal. As a result, turnaround times for government approval dropped from 2-3 months to 10-15 days (Zhang, 2002) . The city's Municipal's Public Security Bureau launched online ID (shen fen zheng) applications for its residents. It also established the Beijing Municipal Public Security Comprehensive Digital Broadband Network Project largely aimed at integrating the voice, data, and video surveillance systems. The Beijing Administration for Industry and Commerce uses an online service platform named Red Shield 315 to offer 20 tax application forms online, as well as forms for registration and annual inspections, corporate identification verification, new Internet business approval, and domain name registrations. Such projects aim to lure investors by making it easy to complete the necessary forms and navigate the often Byzantine bureaucracy of the Chinese state. On days of extreme air pollution or flood possibility, the police department government uses Weibo to notify residents under the Safe Beijing program (Rubenstein, 2012).",

Many Chinese discuss issues of local governance on chat rooms, microblogs, and bulletin board systems. The potential of these venues to undermine the state's monopoly over information is considerable, although given how fastidiously the Chinese government monitors its own people, there are considerable risks to expressing dissident opinions.

State secrecy laws are often woefully out of date and irrelevant for the modern, rational administrative systems that e-government fosters. Fears of the Internet's political potential loom in the background: Hachigian (2001, p. 118) notes that the Communist Party has long been concerned about \"how to prevent this commercial gold mine from becoming political quicksand.\" Luk (2013) points to several obstacles to e-government adoption in China, including an overly skeptical attitude of government officials toward information technology and the lack of sufficient financial resources and technical skills. E-government is an abrupt departure from traditional ways of conducting governance, and thus is not always welcomed by those who fear they have something to lose. China's conservative administrative structure has changed little as a result of e-government. This leads municipal authorities sometimes to supply the government in Beijing with false data. Ma et al.

Rather than an undifferentiated whole, it is more realistic to view the state as a galaxy of agencies and offices with competing demands. Control over the Internet rests in the hands of a dozen different authorities. Turf battles among different ministries, each of which views the Internet as its exclusive domain, have led to struggles over budgets and hampered the formation of well-coordinated policies. For example, the Xinhua news agency and the China International Travel Services have battled over the revenues from international firms such as Reuters. The State Administrative of Radio, Film, and Television and China Telecomm sustained conflicts over the development of broadband cable services, and the resulting revenues. Conversely, e-government does not only reflect, but also affects, the government's administrative structure (Liou, 2007) .",

Key to this effort is the Village Access Project (Xia and Lu, 2008), which began in 2004 to provide telephony in rural areas. Many migrants to urban areas, whose numbers may exceed 100 million, particularly those without hukou permits to live there, lack Internet access or literacy in information technology and thus cannot utilize e-government services (Wang and Chen, 2012). However, some Chinese planners see e-government as a means of decreasing the urban-rural divide as the Internet spreads into remote villages, including electronic classrooms. As Mo et al. (2013) point out, the One Laptop per Child program has helped to provide computer skills to disadvantaged children of rural migrants. With funding from the United Nations Development Program, the Ministry of Science and Technology funded a series of rural telecenters in rural Wu'an (Soriano, 2007; Zhang, 2007) . Sichuan addressed the issue with a public-private partnership that portrayed serving the unprofitable rural market as a civic duty for telecommunications carriers (Liu, 2012 (Liu, , 2016 . And, as Rubenstein (2012) notes, \"In 2010, the Ministry of Agriculture began an outreach program aimed at rural farmers that distributes information on weather, drought, and agricultural science via text message.\" But the problems of rural informatization are severe and persistent (Qiang et al., 2009; Oreglia, 2014) , with low incomes and rates of computer literacy.",

There are numerous components to the Great Firewall that operate with varying degrees of effectiveness. International Internet connections to China are squeezed through a selected group of state-controlled backbone networks. Popular access to many common web services, such as Google and Yahoo!, is heavily restricted (MacKinnon, 2008; Paltemaa and Vuori, 2009 ). The national government hires armies of low-paid commentators, commonly called by the derogatory term the \"five-mao party,\" to monitor blogs and chat rooms, inserting comments that \"spin\" issues in a light favorable to the Chinese state. Some municipal governments take censorship into their own hands: Beijing, for example, uses 10,000 volunteer Internet monitors (Wines, 2010). However, a large share of censorship occurs via Internet companies themselves (MacKinnon, 2008) , which monitor chat rooms, blogs, networking services, search engines, and video sites for politically sensitive material to conform to government restrictions. Websites that help users circumvent censorship like anonymizer.com and proxify.com are prohibited. Users who attempt to access blocked sites are confronted by Jingjing and Chacha, two cartoon police officers who inform them that they are being monitored. Instant messaging and mobile phone text messaging services are heavily filtered, including a program called QQ, which is automatically installed on users' computers to monitor communications. Blogs critical of the government are frequently dismantled, although for the most part the government outsources this function to blog-hosting companies (MacKinnon, 2008) . In 2006, for example, Microsoft's MSN Spaces blog-hosting site agreed to conform to government \"guidelines\" in return for freedom from censorship at the ISP level. In June, 2009, the government attempt to require manufacturers to install filtering software known as Green Dam Youth Escort on all new computers, but retreated in the face of a massive popular and corporate outcry; a lawsuit from a California firm, Cybersitter, alleging that China stole its software (Crovitz, 2010); and the fact that Green Dam inadvertently jammed government computers (Lake, 2009). In response, Falun Gong released a program to circumvent it called Green Tsunami. The Great Firewall system began in 2006 under an initiative known as the \"Golden Shield,\" a national surveillance network that China developed with the aid of US companies Nortel and Cisco Systems (Lake, 2009) and extended beyond the Internet to include digital identification cards with microchips containing personal data that allow the state to recognize faces and voices of its 1.3 billion plus inhabitants. The envy of authoritarian governments worldwide, the Golden Shield has been exported to Cuba, Iran, and Belarus. Indeed, in many respects, China's state-led program of Internet development serves as a model for other authoritarian governments elsewhere.",

Although it cannot monitor all websites in the countries, the state pursues the intimidation strategy popularly known as \"killing the chicken to scare the monkeys\" (Harwit and Clark, 2001) . Reporters Without Borders reported in 2008 that China had incarcerated 49 cyberdissidents, the most in the world. For example, cyberjournalist Hu Jia, winner of the European Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, was sentenced to 3\u00bd years in prison in 2008 for \"inciting subversion of state power.\" Human rights activist Huang Qi received a similar sentence that same year for posting criticisms of the Sichuan earthquake relief efforts. Librarian Liu Jin received 3 years imprisonment for downloading information about the organization Falun Gong, which China treats as terrorists. China's best known blogger, Zhou Shuguang, was prohibited from traveling to Germany to judge an international blogging competition. Others have been prosecuted for posting or downloading information about Tibetan independence, Taiwanese separatism, or the Tiananmen Square massacre. No avenue exists to repeal censorship decisions. Such measures have helped to limit the use of the web by democracy and human rights advocates, Tibet separatists, and religious groups such as Falun Gong. They also help proactively to sway public opinion in favor of the state. However, given the polymorphous nature of the web, such restrictions eventually fail sooner or later. By accessing foreign proxy servers, a few intrepid Chinese netizens engage in fanqiang, or \"scaling the wall\" (Stone and Barboza, 2010) . Using its programmers in the United States., Falun Gong has developed censorship-circumventing software called Freegate, which it has offered to dissidents elsewhere, particularly in Iran (Lake, 2009). Chinese censorship and its resistance thus form a continually changing front of strategies and tactics: As one Chinese blogger put it, \"It is like a water flow -if you block one direction, it flows to other directions, or overflows\" (quoted in James, 2009).",

China's programs appear above all to be designed to encourage economic growth. Thus, front and center are efforts designed to facilitate the growth of e-commerce, including tariff and tax collection, promotion of FDI and tourism, financial management, and intellectual property. Such measures surely placate the middle class, an undertaking that their planners no doubt hoped would help to legitimize the rule of the Communist Party. There is a rich array of municipal and provincial e-government programs as well that touch on the lives of Chinese urbanites in many ways, including contact with police departments, tax declarations, telemedicine, and microblogs. China has done little to confront the digital divide and underserved rural areas; for example, it lacks a robust series of rural telecenters such as found in India. Finally, China is one of the world's most aggressive censors of the Internet, testimony to the fear that the ruling party has widespread access to information not channeled through the state.",

Hong Kong's success in e-government is manifested in several ways. It initiated an Electronic Transactions Ordinance in 2000, paving the way for paperless government offices. The ITTB created an e-government coordination office to change bureaucratic cultures resistant to e-government, to provide technical help, and to provide guidelines for how to optimally disseminate information over the web.

ESDlife is an innovative joint venture between the state and the private sector, which makes the government a user rather than the owner.

Similarly, the Hong Kong Hospital Authority uses intranet to provide health information and booking services, clinical guidelines, a medical database, and training programs. Hong Kong residents are legally required to carry identification cards, whose information links to this system seamlessly. During the SARS outbreak, the government sent warning via text messages to 6 million people. The Drainage Services Department conducts inspections using mobile phones. The Hong Kong Police Force offers an online reporting center to report crimes. The city's judicial system offers online guides to the courts, including dockets. To address the city's digital divide, Hong Kong established the Community Cyber Point project, which offers Internet access in post offices, libraries, and community centers.

The mayor of Taipei, for example, has a special email system for this purpose, although his office is cognizant that the digital divide limits this avenue to those with Internet access (Chen et al., 2006) . Indeed, the wide variations in adoption of e-government tools among the country's national and local governments reveal an intragovernmental \"digital divide\" (Chen et al., 2006) . Some locales have excelled: for example, Taoyuan County undertook U-Taoyuan, a large e-government initiative that provides comprehensive services to the local aviation and logistics industry. The county government uses RSS feeds to disseminate updates and promote new services; mashups offer essential information to targeted communities. Blogs and discussion for a new facility involve the local community, and the government provides updates through RSS feeds.",

In 2015, China announced its latest initiative, Internet Plus.
