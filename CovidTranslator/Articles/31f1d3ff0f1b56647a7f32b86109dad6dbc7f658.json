            "text": "E pisodes commonly described as bronchitic exacerbations punctuate the natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Prospective studies indicate that patients with moderate to severe COPD experience an average of 1.5 to 3 exacerbations per year. 1, 2 Symptoms typically develop over a 2-to 3-day period and include some combination of fever, worsening dyspnea, cough, increasing volume or purulence of sputum, and chest congestion. Some further impairment of lung function and gas exchange generally accompanies the clinical symptoms. Very mild cases may cause only a few days of discomfort from increased cough and sputum, but a severe exacerbation may include hospitalization, life-threatening respiratory failure, and an extended recovery period. Some patients develop full-blown clinical and x-ray features of infectious pneumonia.",

            "text": "Most COPD exacerbations are probably infectious in origin, with a variety of bacterial and viral species having been implicated. Infectious agents commonly found in the sputa of patients with exacerbations include bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas species), viruses (rhinoviruses, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytia, and coronavirus), and atypical organisms (Mycoplasma pneumoniae). [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] It is difficult to assign a specific etiology in most cases, because many of the potentially pathogenic microorganisms found in sputa during exacerbations may also be isolated from the bronchial tree of these same patients during periods of stable respiratory symptoms. 8 Air pollution and other environmental factors also may have important causative roles. 9 Individual susceptibility to exacerbations appears to vary widely for reasons that are not fully understood. Some patients rarely experience a COPD exacerbation, whereas others with similar levels of lung function will have many such events. 1 A number of risk factors that predispose patients with COPD to develop severe exacerbations have been identified. For example, of patients being discharged after a COPD hospitalization, nearly one third will be readmitted for COPD within the ensuing 12 months. 10 Other predictors of COPD hospitalization include advanced age, low levels of baseline lung function, prior systemic corticosteroid use, severely impaired gas exchange, low body mass index, the presence of comorbidities, underprescription of home oxygen, and poor overall quality of life. [11] [12] [13] [14] The rate of exacerbation is a major factor in the high morbidity associated with COPD. Dyspnea is the single most distressing symptom of this disease, and a severe exacerbation may cause extended periods of ventilatory and exercise impairment. 2 It is not surprising, therefore, that multiple exacerbations have a substantial adverse impact on a patient's quality of life. 15 In addition, there is now evidence that repeated exacerbations may accelerate the natural history of the disease. Smokers with recurrent exacerbations experience temporally related declines in lung function that considerably exceed those seen in smokers with infrequent exacerbations. 16, 17 Antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids are commonly used to treat COPD exacerbations, but their administration is also associated with some unwanted effects. 18, 19 Many experts believe that the widespread-and perhaps indiscriminate-prescription of antibiotics for respiratory infections has contributed to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains among common bacterial pathogens. 20 Newer and more expensive antibiotics are commonly prescribed for exacerbations, even though they have no proven advantage over older, first-line drugs. 21 Chronic or repeated administration of systemic corticosteroids confers a substantial risk of osteoporosis, cataract development, hyperglycemia, and other serious adverse effects. [22] [23] [24] Hospitalization and urgent care visits due to severe COPD exacerbations are hugely important in terms both of human and healthcare costs. COPD was the first-listed diagnosis for 662,000 hospital admissions and for 1,400,000 emergency room visits in the United States in 1998. 25, 26 Patients hospitalized for COPD spend a disproportionately large amount of time in critical care units. Importantly, COPD was listed as a contributing cause in 2,530,000 additional hospitalizations (7.0% of total hospitalizations). Pneumonia is among the most common comorbid conditions associated with COPD, and community surveys have shown that elderly patients with COPD have up to a 7-fold greater risk of being hospitalized for pneumonia compared with age-matched controls without lung disease. 27, 28 A study of the National Medical Expenditure Survey reported that 68% of direct medical expenditures for patients with COPD were for hospitalization. 29 Prescribed drugs (7.9%) and outpatient clinic visits (9.7%) were far less important in financial terms. A second economic study came to essentially the same conclusions about the economic impact of hospitalization. 30 As stated by Strassels and colleagues, 29 \"Interventions that result in persons with COPD spending less time in the hospital with COPD are likely to be cost-effective from a societal perspective.\"",

There are intriguing reports that the immune-modulating agent OM-85 may have a substantial protective effect against COPD exacerbations and hospitalizations, but those findings have yet to be confirmed. 36, 37 Mucolytics and Antioxidants A group of compounds, including, among others, acetylcysteine, carbocysteine, bromhexine, and ambroxol, are prescribed in many countries with the belief that they improve symptoms of cough and sputum and reduce exacerbation frequency. These agents are commonly described as mucolytics, but many also have antioxidant properties, and it is unclear what their mode of action might be, assuming they have beneficial effects. A metaanalysis of 23 trials that met specific quality criteria indicated that active treatment reduced the mean number of exacerbations per patient by 29%, along with reductions in the average days of illness and average days on antibiotic. 38 However, the authors pointed out that the large amount of unexplained heterogeneity in the results casts doubt on the reliability of the conclusions. None of the trials reported an effect of treatment on hospitalization rates, and there are indications that most patients included in these trials probably had relatively mild airflow obstruction. The Bronchitis Randomized on NAC Cost-Utility Study (BRONCUS), a European randomized clinical trial, is testing the effect of oral acetylcysteine in 523 trial subjects with relatively mild (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV 1 ], 40% to 70% predicted) COPD. 39 The primary study outcome is the change in the slope of the FEV 1 over a 3-year period of treatment, with exacerbation rate being a secondary outcome measure. Results from this trial should soon be available.",

Sin and Tu 10 analyzed a large provincial database in Canada and identified patients who were and were not prescribed inhaled corticosteroids at the time of hospital discharge for a COPD exacerbation. Patients who received inhaled corticosteroids experienced a 24% relative reduction in hospital readmission rate (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.80 -0.71) and a 29% reduction in all-cause mortality rate (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.65-0.78) over the ensuing year.

            "text": "Theophylline and related compounds, once favored as treatment for COPD, have now been relegated to a marginal role. 31 The reasons for the ascendancy of theophylline are as mysterious as the reasons for its decline, because neither circumstance was based on large, adequately designed trials to evaluate important clinical outcomes. Because of certain previously unappreciated anti-inflammatory properties, there is some resurgent interest in theophylline. 65 Several large trials suggest that theophylline might have some benefit in preventing or ameliorating severe COPD exacerbations, but confirmatory trials are needed. 59, 66, 67 Antibiotics The authors of a systemic review of 9 randomized placebo-controlled trials concluded that regular administration of oral antibiotics reduced bronchitic exacerbation rates by a small but statistically significant degree (P \u03fd 0.05). 68 The authors voiced doubts about the clinical significance of this finding because of their concerns about costs, the emergence of bacterial resistance, and other adverse effects. Moreover, all of those studies were performed before 1970, and the results may no longer be relevant because patterns of bacterial antibiotic susceptibility have changed appreciably in the interval. More recent retrospective studies have suggested that the choice of antibiotic might delay the time to the next COPD exacerbation, but these observations have not yet been subjected to appropriately designed clinical trials. 69, 70 Rehabilitation and Education Pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with severe COPD produces some benefit in terms of symptoms, exercise capability, and quality of life, at least in the short term. However, hopes that rehabilitation programs might reduce the health resource utilization that is attributable to exacerbations have been rather disappointing for the most part. 71, 72 A recently published trial demonstrated that an intense education and self-management program reduced total exacerbations by 17% and disease-related hospitalizations by 27% in patents with severe COPD. 73 It will be important to determine whether the results of this relatively small trial are reproducible and generalizable.

Observational studies indicate a strong benefit from regular immunizations, particularly for influenza. Vaccines against other suspected viral and bacterial pathogens are in development and hold some promise for further reducing exacerbation rates. Numerous randomized controlled trials suggest that inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators decrease exacerbation rates. However, with a single exception, no trial has been designed expressly for the purpose of assessing differences in exacerbation rates, and that exception produced a negative result. 40 Hence, large, appropriately designed, confirmatory trials are still needed. Given the enormity of their associated human and economic impacts, it is particularly important that trials be designed to adequately assess hospitalization rates. In this regard, tiotropium is particularly interesting, because the trial results to date indicate that it might reduce hospitalization rates by \u054640%.",
