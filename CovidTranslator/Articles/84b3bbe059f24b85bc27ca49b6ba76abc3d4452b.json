In this report, virus-like particles were assembled in insect cells by the co-infection with recombinant baculoviruses, which separately express one of these three virion proteins. We found that the membrane and envelope proteins are sufficient for the efficient formation of virus-like particles and could be visualized by electron microscopy. Sucrose gradient purification followed by Western blot analysis and immunogold labeling showed that the spike protein could be incorporated into the virus like particle also. The construction of engineered virus-like particles bearing resemblance to the authentic one is an important step towards the development of an effective vaccine against infection of SARS CoV.",

The causative agent for SARS has subsequently been identified as a novel coronavirus [1] . Coronaviruses are among the largest of the enveloped RNA viruses. SARS-associated coronavirus, SARS CoV, has a positive-strand RNA genome of 29 kb and measures about 100 nm in diameter [2, 3] . The viral envelope contains at least three structural membrane proteins, i.e., spike (S), membrane (M), and small membrane or envelope (E) proteins. The S proteins make up the characteristic \"club-shaped\" or \"crownlike\" projection of coronaviruses. The S protein is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein, containing a large extracellular domain, a short transmembrane domain, and a small cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminus [4] , and is responsible for the entry of the virus into host cells. The M protein is the most abundant virion protein, which is a triple-spanning integral membrane protein with a short ectodomain and a large carboxyl-terminal endodomain [5] . The E protein, the third virion constitution, contains a hydrophobic region flanked by hydrophilic termini [6] .",

The receptor binding domain of S of SARS CoV and the receptor of the host cell have recently been identified [8, 9] , which is also different from previous studies for other coronaviruses [10] [11] [12] . Thus, although previous studies on coronaviruses showed that possession of the M and E proteins is a minimal requirement for the assembly of viral particles, whereas the S protein is dispensable, but is included when present [13] [14] [15] [16] , the demonstration that E and M proteins are sufficient for the assembly of SARS CoV-like particles, and these virus-like particles (VLPs) can further incorporate S proteins are still imperative knowledge and technology for rational strategy (ex. vaccine development) to combat this deadly virus. In this communication, we report the formation and isolation of SARS CoV-like particles through the co-expression of either E and M proteins or E, M, and S proteins using a baculovirusinsect cell system.",

We found the formation of VLPs was satisfactory at moi of 1:5. Fig. 1A shows a typical electron micrograph of a cell co-infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing both E and M proteins, in which the boxed region was further magnified in Fig. 1B . The VLPs were observed in a large lightly stained vesicle (solid arrow). A higher magnification showed that several heavily stained smaller vesicles with VLPs were also found (open arrows) near the lightly stained vesicle. These lightly and darkly stained structures are similar to the electron microscopic studies of a specimen from SARS patient [21] . The distribution of VLPs in the baculovirus-insect cell system was also consistent with a previous study demonstrating the assembly of hepatitis C virus-like particles in insect cells [22] . In Figs. 1C and D, the cytoplasm of a cell is covered with VLPs, some of which are arbitrarily indicated by arrowheads. This result suggested that VLP-containing vesicles (open arrow in (B)) were disrupted and VLPs were released all over in the cytoplasm in some cells.",

Another possible application is to define the possible packaging signal of SARS CoV. The packaging signal of coronavirus RNA was previously identified by using defective interfering viral particles [26] , since the SARS-CoV is a highly infectious virus, it would be much more feasible to identify this signal by using VLPs.
