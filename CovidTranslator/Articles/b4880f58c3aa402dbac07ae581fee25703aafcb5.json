            "text": "Biologic and chemical weapons have been used throughout history. 1 For millennia, indigenous South American peoples deliberately used plant-derived arrow poisons such as curare and toxins from poison dart frogs, although these preparations were used mainly for hunting. Similar toxins were used in Africa. The ancient Greeks, for whom toxikon meant \"arrow poison,\" tipped arrows with winter aconite, and this practice continued into medieval Europe and persisted into the seventeenth century in Spain and Portugal. 2 Soldiers in India used smoke screens, incendiary weapons, and toxic fumes as early as 2000 BCE, and the Sung Dynasty in China employed a wide variety of arsenical smokes and other poisons in battle. The military use of toxins dates from at least the sixth century BCE, when Assyrian soldiers poisoned enemy wells with ergot-contaminated rye. In 423 BCE, during the Peloponnesian War, Thracian allies of Sparta captured the Athenian fort at Delium by using a long tube and bellows to blow a poisonous smoke from coals, sulfur, and pitch into the fort. Greek fire (likely composed of rosin, sulfur, pitch, naphtha, lime, and saltpeter) was invented in the seventh century CE and proved to be a very effective naval weapon. Various poisons saw battlefield use during medieval times, and the use of poisons for murder (including assassinations) became widespread. Other examples before the twentieth century include the contamination of water by dumping the corpses of dead humans or animals into wells, the use of snakes and other creatures as poisonous vectors, and occasionally, fomites to transmit infections such as smallpox to unsuspecting victims. This latter technique was used with remarkable success during the French and Indian War (1754-1767), when Sir Jeffrey Amherst was alleged to have given \"gifts\" (blankets) harboring the pus and scabs from smallpox victims to unsuspecting Native American Indians. The Indians possessed no immunity against smallpox and thus experi-enced very high rates of infection and mortality as smallpox swept through the local tribes. 3 During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the science and technology necessary for the development of sophisticated biologic and chemical weapons proceeded apace. World War I saw the first large-scale use of \"poison gas,\" including lacrimators, chlorine, phosgene, arsenicals, cyanide, and sulfur mustard. By the end of the war, nearly one in every three rounds was a chemical munition. Dr. Shiro Ishii and other Japanese scientists in the infamous Unit 731 worked on the weaponization of anthrax, plague, smallpox, and tetrodotoxin as well as a variety of chemical agents during World War II. There are even suspicions that the bomb used in the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in Czechoslovakia in 1942 contained botulinum toxin. 4 After World War II, ricin was used as an injectable assassination weapon, and in the 1970s and 1980s T-2 toxin, a trichothecene mycotoxin, was alleged to have been the toxic component of the \"yellow rain\" employed against H'Mong refugees from Laos. More recently, Iraq and Iran both used chemical weapons against each other in the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, and Iraq had a weapons program that included the development of sulfur mustard, nerve agents, \"Agent 15\" (an anticholinergic incapacitating agent), botulinum toxin, epsilon toxin from Clostridium perfringens, and aflatoxin. 5 Militia groups in the United States and terrorist groups throughout the world have used ricin for political purposes.",

Since that time, at least 140 nations have either signed or ratified this treaty. 6 However, the Soviet Union and Iraq began violating the treaty in short order. In the Soviet Union, weapons scientists stepped up research and development of numerous biologic and chemical weapons as part of one of the largest and most comprehensive biologic-weapons programs in history. Soviet scientists created large stockpiles of weaponized anthrax, plague, smallpox, tularemia, nerve agent, mustard, and other biologic and chemical agents. 5 In 1979, the world was put on notice of the devastating potential that biologic weapons pose to humanity.",

Seventy-seven cases and 66 deaths were reported. Dr. Matthew Meselson, a Harvard scientist, was permitted to study the event many years later and reported the results of his work in a 1979 Science article. Meselson determined that the majority of the deaths had occurred among victims living in a narrow 4-km-wide band downwind from the plant. Animal deaths were confirmed as far as 30 km downwind. Meselson further concluded that less than 1 g of weapons-grade anthrax had been released from the plant. 7 If his calculations are accurate, weaponized anthrax possesses staggering potential as a biologic weapon given its stability, its relative ease of production, and its ability to be dispersed in a clandestine manner over great distances.",

            "text": "In March 1995, after having unsuccessfully attempted to deploy biologic agents, members of the Aum Shinri Kyo cult executed a coordinated attack with the nerve agent sarin (GB) on the Tokyo subway system. Over 5500 people sought medical treatment, and a dozen died. The Aum Shinri Kyo had used sarin in Matsumoto 9 months earlier in an attack that had exposed more than 300 people and had killed 7 in an attempt to assassinate judges unfavorable to their cause. 8, 9 The anthrax attacks in the fall of 2001 involved the use of letters containing weapons-grade anthrax mailed through the U.S. postal system. Five people died and 17 became ill with either cutaneous or inhalational anthrax. Buildings contaminated with spores included the Hart Senate Office building and the Brentwood postal facilities in Washington, DC. It cost millions of dollars to rehabilitate these buildings. The anthrax used in the attacks was determined to be extremely potent and could have caused far greater numbers of casualties had it been dispersed more widely. 10, 11 According to Dr. Ken Alibek, former Deputy Director of Biopreparat, the Soviet Union's nominally civilian medical research institute, Soviet scientists and physicians spent large sums of money and manpower during the 1980s and 1990s developing the most lethal and potent biologic weapons known to man. In addition to weaponizing the etiologic agents of anthrax, smallpox, Marburg fever, and others, they created antibioticresistant strains of Yersinia pestis (plague), Francisella tularensis, and other pathogens. Furthermore, by applying genetic engineering techniques, the Soviets are also alleged to have created pathogens with novel characteristics and strains of several organisms capable of defeating certain vaccines. 12 As we enter the biotechnologic revolution of the twenty-first century, our understanding of molecular biology, genetics, and biochemistry is exploding. The human genome has been sequenced, and it is now possible to manipulate genes from disparate organisms to create new and novel pathogens. Scientists are also able to synthesize and weaponize a number of different endogenous biologic-response modifiers including cytokines, hormones, neurotransmitters, and plasma proteases. But even nature continues to surprise us. New, naturally occurring infections with the potential to cause largescale human diseases and death continue to emerge at an ever-increasing rate throughout the world, and it is conceivable that these pathogens could also be weaponized by enterprising scientists.",

During the past 20 years, over 30 new lethal pathogens have been identified. 13 A classic example of this emerging threat is pandemic influenza. In 1918, as World War I was coming to an end, the Spanish flu struck with devastating consequences. In less than 1 year, this virus was able to circumnavigate the globe and kill an estimated 40 million people. 14 More recently, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Southeast Asia resulted from a coronavirus that jumped species from animals to humans and rapidly spread to 29 countries in less than 90 days. Novel and dormant infectious agents such as SARS or influenza appear to be emerging or reemerging with increasing frequency and with greater potential for serious consequences. Many factors contribute to the emergence of new diseases: environmental changes, global travel and trade, social upheaval, and genetic changes in infectious agent, host, or vector populations. Once a new disease is introduced into a suitable human population, it often spreads rapidly and with devastating impact on the medical and public health infrastructure. If the disease is severe, it may lead to social disruption and have a profound economic impact. Outbreaks of emerging or reemerging diseases may be difficult to distinguish from outbreaks as a result of intentional introduction of infectious diseases for nefarious purposes.",

As of May 2004, a large outbreak of avian influenza involving the H5N1 strain and human cases has been reported in two countries from this region. 15 Thus far, no human-to-human transmission has been reported, but the potential exists for genetic reassortment between avian and human or animal strains of influenza. A recent report in the journal Science linked the influenza virus responsible for the 1918 epidemic to a possible avian origin. 16 If true, avian influenza may pose a much greater danger to human populations than previously reported. The disease presents in humans in a fashion similar to other types of influenza viruses. It usually begins with fever, chills, headaches, and myalgias and often involves the upper and lower respiratory tract with development of cough, dyspnea, and in severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome. Laboratory findings may include pancytopenia, lymphopenia, elevated liver enzymes, hypoxia, a positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test for H5N1, and a positive neutralization assay for H5N1 influenza strain. In vitro studies suggest that the neuraminidase (NA)-inhibitor class of drugs may have clinical efficacy in the treatment and prevention of avian influenza infection. 17 ",

That year, SARS was responsible for approximately 900 deaths and over 8000 infections in people from at least 29 countries worldwide. Before a case definition had been clearly established, Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) over 300 cases of an atypical pneumonia with five related deaths, all originated from Guangdong province in China during February 2003. The infection quickly spread as infected patients traveled to Hong Kong and from there to Vietnam, Canada, and other locations. Only eight laboratory-confirmed cases occurred in the United States, but there is concern that the U.S. population is vulnerable to a widespread outbreak of SARS such as the one that occurred in China, Hong Kong, Singapore,Toronto, and Taiwan in 2003. 18 A SARS case definition evolved from this initial report to the WHO by Chinese health authorities in February 2003. A case was initially defined by clinical criteria; a suspected or probable case was defined as an illness that included potential exposure to an existing case and fever with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome. In April 2003,a confirmed case was defined as a case from which SARS-CoV was isolated from culture. 19 SARS-CoV infections have an incubation period of 2 to 10 days. Systemic symptoms such as fever and chills followed by a dry cough and shortness of breath begin within 2 to 7 days. Patients may develop pneumonia and lymphopenia by days 7 to 10 of the illness. Most patients with SARS-CoV have a clear history of exposure either to a patient with SARS or to a setting in which SARS-CoV is known to exist. Laboratory tests may be helpful but do not reliably detect infection early during the illness. SARS-CoV should be suspected in patients requiring hospitalization for radiographically confirmed pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome of unknown etiology and one of the following risk factors during the 10 days prior to the onset of illness: (1) travel to China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan, or close contact with an ill person having a history of such travel; (2) employment in an occupation associated with a risk for SARS-CoV exposure; or (3) inclusion in a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia without an alternative diagnosis.",

No definitive therapy has been established. Empiric antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia by the current American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines is recommended pending etiologic diagnosis. Diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV include antibody testing using an enzyme immunoassay and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for respiratory, blood, and stool specimens. 20 In the absence of known SARS-CoV transmission, testing is recommended only in consultation with public health authorities. Testing for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, pneumococcus, chlamydia, mycoplasma, and legionella should be conducted, since the identification of one of these agents excludes SARS by case definition. Clinical samples can be obtained during the first week of illness with a nasopharyngeal swab plus an oropharyngeal swab and a serum or a plasma specimen. After the first week of illness, a nasopharyngeal swab plus an oropharyngeal swab and a stool specimen should be obtained. Serum specimens for SARS-CoV antibody testing should be collected when the diagnosis is first suspected and at later times as indicated. An antibody response can occasionally be detected during the first week of illness, is likely to be detected by the end of the second week of illness, and at times may not be detected until more than 28 days after the onset of symptoms. Respiratory specimens from any of several different sources may be collected for viral and bacterial diagnostics, but the preferred specimens of choice are nasopharyngeal washes or aspirates. 20",

For example, BRMs are being used to treat debilitating rheumatoid arthritis by targeting cytokines that contribute to the disease process. 25 By neutralizing or eliminating these targeted cytokines, BRMs may reduce symptoms and decrease inflammation. BRMs may also be used as anticarcinogens, with the following goals: (1) to stop, control, or suppress processes that permit cancer growth, (2) to make cancer cells more recognizable, and therefore more susceptible, to destruction by the immune system, (3) to boost the killing power of immune system cells, such as T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages, (4) to alter growth patterns in cancer cells to promote behavior like that of healthy cells, (5) to block or reverse the processes that change a normal cell or a precancerous cell into a cancerous cell, (6) to enhance the ability of the body to repair or replace normal cells damaged or destroyed by other forms of cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiation, and (7) to prevent cancer cells from spreading to other parts of the body. 26, 27 More of these promising new drugs are currently in development. It can be readily theorized that research to develop various BRMs can be subverted to a malicious end. That is, instead of using BRMs to suppress cancer growth or to decrease disease susceptibility, researchers could develop compounds to cause illness and death.

Such knowledge has led to a deeper understanding of the development of basic immunity to a variety of different human infectious diseases. With this increase in scientific knowledge has come the power to manipulate the immune system at its most fundamental level. As we prepare for future threats, we must not ignore the potential quantum leap that biotechnology offers our enemies in developing new biologic-warfare threats. In fact, there is mounting evidence that new biologic agents have already been produced by former adversaries. Examples of such new threat agents and the potential effects they might have on human subjects have been detailed in the scientific and popular literature. Examples of biologic threats that could be produced through the use of genetic engineering technology include the following: (1) microorgan-isms resistant to antibiotics, standard vaccines, and therapeutics, (2) innocuous microorganisms genetically altered to produce a toxin, a poisonous substance, or an endogenous bioregulator, (3) microorganisms possessing enhanced aerosol and environmental stability characteristics, (4) immunologically altered microorganisms able to defeat standard threat identification and diagnostic methods, (5) genetic vectors capable of transferring human and foreign genes into human cells for therapeutic purposes, 28 and (6) combinations of these with improved delivery systems.",

Risk of use may also differ depending on whether the targets are military versus civilian, human versus nonhuman (animals or plants, including livestock and crops), or individual (as in assassinations) versus large groups, and depending on whether the aim is death versus incapacitation. Risk also depends on agent availability and on the technology available for production, storage, and dissemination; current advances in technology are associated with a higher risk of weaponization.

The CDC lists nearly 70 separate chemicals, including a variety of toxic industrial chemicals and poisons, as potential agents for terrorism. These include osmium tetroxide, long-acting anticoagulants, heavy metals, toxic alcohols, and white phosphorus. 33 A recent issue of the Morbidity and Mortality Report includes an even longer list. 34 Pyrolysis products from explosions and conflagrations may release large quantities of cyanide and other toxicants that, although different from the original chemicals present, may still cause death. Industrial chemicals are readily available in large quantities as preformed compounds and should be considered high on the list of potential terrorist agents. 35, 36 Toxins,which are chemicals produced within biologic organisms, also represent high-threat agents. 37 New chemicals are currently being synthesized on rigid three-dimensional molecular skeletons, the most promising of which are the norbornanes. Building on norbornane geometry allows for a modular enhancement of the number of functional sites on a given molecule. Since many norbornane derivatives,such as the mixture of chlorobornanes known as the toxaphenes, are persistent and have significant acute and chronic toxicity, these derivatives have been considered potential candidates for new agents. 38 Novichok 39-42 (Russian for \"newcomer\") refers to the alleged Russian development of a highly toxic binary nerve agent or generation of nerve agents (sometimes called \"fourth-generation\" agents). Only sketchy and unverifiable information is available in the unclassified literature, but the existence of these agents would demonstrate the possibility of creating new chemical compounds toxic enough to be used as chemical-warfare or terrorist agents. So-called GV analogs combining some of the properties of G-series and V-series nerve agents have also been suggested as potential new agents. 38 The use in 2002 of an incapacitating gas (thought to be an opioid compound derived from fentanyl and possibly mixed with another anesthetic agent) in the siege of a Moscow theater taken over by Chechen rebels was evidence either of the deployment of a preexisting anesthetic agent or of a new anesthetic compound. 43, 44 Organofluorines have been investigated because of their reported ability to defeat protective-mask or chemicalfiltrations systems. 38 Other incapacitating agents under development exert primarily physical rather than chemical effects and include immobilizing agents (\"stickums\"), antitraction gels (\"slickums\"), and malodorants. 45",

The idea was to make storage of chemical rounds safer by stopping the production process at the penultimate synthetic step, resulting in two precursor compounds that when mixed would create the desired agent. These two precursors could then be stored separately. Just prior to use, one component could be inserted into a round, where it would be separated from the other precursor by a thin membrane. The impact and momentum of the launch of the projectile would burst the membrane to allow for mixing of the components and in-flight production of the chemical agent. In practice, this process was often not complete, but the 20% or so of ancillary reaction product was often extremely toxic by itself. Binarization or some similar production-arrest method could theoretically be used by a clandestine terrorist cell to help evade detection and to decrease the risks associated with the production, transportation, and use of chemical agents.",

During World War II, Germany explored particularization of sulfur mustard onto small carrier particles of silica (silicon dioxide), although other powdered silicates (talc, diatomite, and pumice) and clays (kaolinite and Fuller's earth) can also be used. 48 The advantages of such \"dusty agents\" are increased volatility (used to facilitate the movement of relatively nonvolatile agents such as sulfur mustard and the persistent nerve agent VX into the alveoli) and increased penetration of clothing and chemical protective equipment. 49 Iraq used a \"dusty mustard\" composed of 65% sulfur mustard adsorbed onto silica particles ranging in diameter from 0.1 to 10 microns during its war with Iran. Micronization of a variety of chemical, biologic, and toxin agents requires a certain degree of tech-nologic sophistication that is becoming increasingly easy to acquire. Agent delivery can potentially be modified in a variety of ways in addition to thickening and micronization. The Jordanian government released a report in 2004 of the discovery of an elaborate plot by Al Qaeda terrorists for a two-stage attack using a massive vehicle-borne improvised explosive device followed by the release of toxic chemicals to include acetones, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid. 50 Similarly, enhanced-fragmentation munitions could be used in combination with chemical agents to drive the agents more effectively into the body.",

Targeting unusual sequences of high prevalence in certain populations raises the specter of genomic, or ethnic, weapons, as previously described. Less appreciated is the potential for genomics to be used to develop drugs, chemical or toxin agents that can also be targeted to specific variants within a population of humans, animals, or crops. The widespread availability of genome libraries on the Internet makes it nearly impossible to control or restrict access to the already published genomic libraries on over a hundred microbial pathogens. 60 Proteomics complements genomics by characterizing the protein expression of segments of the genome and by making it easier to develop compounds that target or produce a specific protein. Direct gene insertion, genetic delivery via virus or bacteria, or drug tailoring to affect a given protein can all be used. A scorpion toxin has already been successfully engineered into a virus that acts as a pesticide against caterpillars. Protein sequences in toxins are partly responsible for resistance to light, oxygen, moisture, and desiccation; the insertion of genes to create altered proteins or the introduction of chemical agents engineered to cause structural changes in expressed proteins could significantly alter the toxicity of a given compound. 58 Furthermore, the widespread use of DNA microarrays (glass slides or chips imprinted with thousands of specific single-stranded DNA sequences) allows for fast automated screening of candidate compounds.",
