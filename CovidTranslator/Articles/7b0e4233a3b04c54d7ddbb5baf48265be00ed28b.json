            "text": "Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a common cause of diarrhea in children from developing countries. Intimate adhesion of the bacteria to intestinal cells occurs via binding of the adhesin intimin to the TIR receptor exposed on cell surfaces. Here, Lactobacillus casei expressing a fragment of \u2424-intimin (L. casei-Int cv ) was tested as mucosal vaccines in mice against intestinal colonization with the murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Oral or sublingual immunization of C57BL/6 mice with L. casei-Int cv induced anti-Int cv IgA in feces but no IgG in sera. Conversely, anti-Int cv IgG was induced in the sera of mice after sublingual immunization with purified Int cv . All vaccines were able to decrease C. rodentium recovery from feces. However, this reduction was more evident and sustained over time in mice immunized with L. casei-Int cv by the sublingual route. These mice also displayed an increase in interleukin 6 (IL-6) and gamma interferon (IFN-\u2425) secretion by spleen cells 10 days after infection. Additionally, oral or sublingual immunization of C3H/HePas mice, which are highly susceptible to C. rodentium infection, with L. casei-Int cv induced anti-Int cv antibodies and significantly increased survival after challenge. Immunohistological analysis of colon sections revealed that C. rodentium was located in deep fractions of the tissue from C3H/HePas mice immunized with L. casei whereas superficial staining was observed in colon sections from mice immunized with L. casei-Int cv. The results indicate that vaccines composed of L. casei expressing intimin may represent a promising approach and that the C3H/HePas infection model with C. rodentium can be used to evaluate potential vaccines against EPEC.",

            "text": "Gastrointestinal infections are among the leading causes of childhood mortality around the world and are responsible for approximately 2 million deaths every year (12) . Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is one of the main causes of childhood diarrhea in developing countries and has been considered a worldwide pathogen (7, 18, 31, 59) . EPEC has been classified into typical or atypical according to the expression or lack of expression, respectively, of the bundle-forming pilus, encoded by the EAF plasmid (1, 50) . Epidemiological studies suggest that the prevalence of atypical EPEC has increased in acute or persistent diarrhea cases in both children and adults (23, 29, 52, 62) . EPEC colonizes the intestinal mucosa, causing the characteristic attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions. The formation of the A/E lesion involves a type III secretion system (T3SS), encoded by the LEE pathogenicity island, which delivers a range of effector proteins into host cells. Using this strategy, the pathogen triggers actin polymerization, producing a pedestal-shaped structure to which the bacteria strongly attach through the interaction of the adhesin intimin with the translocated receptor Tir (27, 38) . Intimin is a 94-kDa protein inserted into the bacterial outer membranes from typical and atypical EPEC, enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), and the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. This adhesin is encoded by the eae gene and is essential for virulence (28, 48) . The N-terminal region is conserved among intimins, whereas the C-terminal portion is highly variable and has been used to classify intimin into 29 types that can be related to tropism for different intestinal tissues (26, 35, 49) . Among them, the \u2424 subtype is one of the intimins most frequently expressed by EPEC isolates (6, 56, 60) . EPEC and EHEC infections can be prevented by breastfeeding (17, 57) , and antibodies against intimin are usually observed in the milk of women living in areas of endemicity (58, 70) . In addition, these antibodies are able to inhibit the adhesion of EPEC to epithelial cells in vitro (15, 19) . Several vaccination strategies using intimin have reduced colonization or mortality in animal models of infection with rabbit enteropathogenic E. coli (REPEC), EHEC, or C. rodentium (4, 30, 36, 39) , suggesting that intimin is a good candidate for the formulation of vaccines against these infections. A minimal intimin fragment able to bind to the receptor Tir is composed of the last 190 amino acids, but high-affinity binding was observed only with a larger fragment comprising the last 280 amino acid residues (Int 280 ) (8) . In fact, subcutaneous immunization of mice with the Int 280 fragment from \u2423-intimin reduced intestinal colonization by a C. rodentium strain expressing an intimin from the same subtype (30) . However, analysis of the immunodominant regions inside Int 280 have shown that antibodies against this fragment were directed to 2 regions in the N terminus of Int 280 , more precisely, a region located in the first 80 amino acids and a region between amino acids 80 and 130 of Int 280 (3) . Moreover, human colostrum samples specifically recognized these fragments, but not the C-terminal region of Int 280 , indicating that natural exposure to intimin-bearing pathogens elicits antibodies that are reactive only to the N-terminal region of Int 280 (3) .",

Previous works have already tested attenuated pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica and Vibrio cholerae, as live vectors for mucosal delivery of intimin (39) (40) . A safer alternative to deliver antigens at mucosal sites can be the use of lactic acid bacteria as live vectors. This strategy has been successfully applied with different antigens in animal experimentation (11, 16, 24, 33, 45, 67) .",

Female specific-pathogen-free (SPF) C57BL/6 mice (5 to 7 weeks old; 4 or 5 animals per group) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) or from the animal facility of Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo (CEDEME). Conventional C3H/HePas mice were obtained from the animal facility of Faculdade de Medicina Veterin\u00e1ria, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo. The mice were supplied with food and water ad libitum. The experimental procedures were previously approved by the Ethical Committee in Animal Experimentation from Instituto Butantan under license number 588/09 or by the University of California-San Diego (UCSD) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Before starting the immunization protocols, preimmune sera and feces were collected and analyzed for the presence of antibodies reacting with Int cv by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Animals presenting positive reactions were not used in the experiments. For immunization with recombinant L. casei, bacteria were grown until late stationary phase (optical density at 550 nm [OD 550 ], 2.0), collected by centrifugation (16,000 \u03eb g for 6 min at room temperature), washed twice, and suspended in saline to 2 \u03eb 10 10 CFU/ml for oral immunization or 10 11 CFU/ml for s.l. immunization. Prior to oral immunization, all mice received 0.2 M sodium bicarbonate in 300 l of saline by oral gavage. Mice were immunized through the oral route on days 0, 1, 2, 14, 15, 16, 28, 29 , and 30 with 10 10 CFU of L. casei-Int cv or L. casei in 500 l of saline, using a gavage. Control mice received 500 l of saline. For the s.l. immunizations, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 0.2% xylazine and 1% ketamine in 200 l of saline, and the groups received 10 9 CFU of L. casei or L. casei-Int cv in 10 l of saline on days 0, 14, and 28. An additional group received 15 g of purified Int cv on the same days. Control mice received saline. For all immunizations with Int cv , the excess of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was removed from the purified protein by Triton X-114 extraction (5) . The final amount of LPS in these preparations was determined by the Limulus amebocyte lysate test as 0.5 endotoxin units/g protein. The vaccines were delivered with the help of a micropipette under the tongue and directed toward the floor of the mouth (20) . Mice were maintained with their heads still and flexed up for 30 min. Subcutaneous immunization was used as a control for the capacity of the Int cv fragment to reduce C. rodentium colonization in mice (see the supplemental material).",

Before testing the effectiveness of L. casei-based vaccines against the murine model of C. rodentium infection, we decided to validate the use of the Int cv fragment as an antigen against C. rodentium colonization. In a previous work, Ghaem-Maghami and collaborators (30) showed that subcutaneous immunization of mice with a fragment of \u2423-intimin containing the 280 carboxy-terminal amino acids of the protein (Int 280\u2423) induced specific immune responses and significantly reduced colon colonization by a C. rodentium strain that expresses \u2423-intimin. We thus performed experiments of subcutaneous immunization of C57BL/6 mice with the Int cv fragment. The immunization induced significantly higher concentrations of anti-Int cv IgA in feces (P \u03ed 0.01), as well as anti-Int cv IgG in sera (P \u03ed 0.0001), than the inoculation of saline (see Fig. S1A and B in the supplemental FIG. 1. Immunization and challenge of C57BL/6 and C3H/HePas mice with C. rodentium. Oral immunization was performed using a gavage. Mice received saline, L. casei (10 10 CFU), or L. casei-Int cv (10 10 CFU) on three consecutive days at 15-day intervals, totaling 9 doses. S.l. immunization was performed in three doses of saline, L. casei (10 9 CFU), L. casei-Int cv (10 9 CFU), or Int cv (15 g) . Fifteen days after the last immunization, the mice were challenged with 5 \u03eb 10 8 CFU of C. rodentium by the oral route, and colonization or survival was followed in C57BL/6 or C3H/HePas mice, respectively. Anti-Int cv antibodies were measured in blood and feces before challenge or in feces at different periods after challenge. Secretion of cytokines by spleen cells collected at the endpoint of the colonization experiment (10 days after challenge) was measured in C57BL/6 mice immunized by the s.l. route. . Evaluation of C. rodentium challenge in immunized mice revealed that significantly lower levels of bacteria were recovered from mouse feces than were observed in mice inoculated with saline. This reduction was observed at all points evaluated, which were on days 4 (P \u03ed 0.002), 7 (P \u03ed 0.008), and 10 (P \u03ed 0.0004) (see Fig. S2A , B, and C, respectively, in the supplemental material). The levels of C. rodentium recovery from the feces of all C57BL/6 mice (both control and immunized groups) were drastically reduced after the 10th day postinfection, impairing the analysis of the effects induced by the vaccines. Therefore, this was used as the endpoint in all subsequent experiments. Groups of mice inoculated with saline or immunized with L. casei or L. casei-Int cv through the oral or s.l. route were challenged with C. rodentium 15 days after the last immunizations. Feces were collected at the determined intervals, and CFU were evaluated after plating the samples onto MacConkey agar. Oral immunization of mice with L. casei-Int cv led to a significant reduction in C. rodentium recovery from feces on days 4 and 7 after challenge, compared with the control groups, which received saline (P \u03ed 0.0001 on day 4 and P \u03ed 0.0003 on day 7) or L. casei (P \u03ed 0.0002 on day 4 and P \u03ed 0.0001 on day 7) (Fig. 3A and B) . However, 10 days after challenge, the reduction observed was less evident, and the recovery of C. rodentium at this point was only significantly different from that observed in mice that received saline (P \u03ed 0.01) (Fig. 3C) .",

Therefore, we decided to analyze the possible induction of these cytokines by the L. casei-Int cv s.l. vaccine. Secretion of IL-6 and IFN-\u2425 was evaluated in spleen cells collected from mice immunized with L. casei-Int cv and stimulated in vitro with Int cv . However, due to the variability observed among animals, the results were inconclusive (data not shown). We then decided to analyze the secretion of these cytokines by spleen cells col-lected from immunized mice 10 days after challenge with C. rodentium (the endpoint of the colonization experiment), and stimulated in vitro with Int cv . Cells from mice immunized with the L. casei-Int cv vaccine through the s.l. route showed a significant increase in IL-6 secretion 10 days after C. rodentium infection compared with cells from mice inoculated with L. casei (P \u03fd 0.01) or saline (P \u03fd 0.001) (Fig. 4A) . Moreover, the levels of IL-6 were also significantly higher than the levels observed in cells obtained from animals immunized with Int cv (P \u03fd 0.05). On the other hand, the levels of IL-6 secretion by cells collected from mice immunized with Int cv , were not statistically different from the levels secreted by cells collected from mice that received saline. Secretion of IFN-\u2425 by spleen cells was also evaluated in mice immunized through the s.l. route 10 days after challenge with C. rodentium. Once again, the highest levels of secretion were observed in cells from mice immunized with L. casei-Int cv , and the results were significantly different from those observed in cells from mice immunized with L. casei (P \u03fd 0.05) or inoculated with saline (P \u03fd 0.05) (Fig. 4B) . Although higher levels of IFN-\u2425 secretion were also observed in cells collected from mice immunized with the Int cv fragment through the s.l. route, the results were not statistically different from the levels secreted by cells from animals that received saline (Fig. 4B) .",

The effect of L. casei-Int cv vaccination through both oral and s.l. routes was evaluated in a C3H-derived mouse strain (C3H/HePas) that is highly susceptible to C. rodentium infection (64) . The permanency of L. casei and L. casei-Int cv in the intestinal mucosa of C3H/HePas mice was determined as described for C57BL/6 mice, and the results showed that L. casei and L. casei-Int cv could be recovered from feces for up to 24 h after a single inoculation. After this time point, no erythromycin-resistant L. casei colonies were observed in feces and no differences were observed between the two L. casei strains (data not shown). Immunization of mice with L. casei-Int cv by the oral route induced significantly higher concentrations of anti-Int cv IgA in feces than the immunization of mice with L. casei (P \u03ed 0.04) (Fig. 5A) . However, the concentrations of anti-Int cv IgG observed in sera from mice immunized with these formulations were not statistically different (Fig. 5C) . Sublingual immunization of C3H/HePas mice with L. casei-Int cv instead induced significantly higher levels of both anti-Int cv IgA in feces (P \u03ed 0.02) (Fig. 5B) and IgG in sera (P \u03ed 0.003) (Fig. 5D ) than in mice immunized with L. casei. C3H/HePas mice immunized with both formulations by the oral or the s.l. route were challenged with C. rodentium, and survival was followed for 14 days. The group that received L. casei-Int cv by the oral route showed a significant increase in mean survival time after challenge compared with the group immunized with L. casei (P \u03ed 0.0001) (Fig. 6A) . Mice immunized by the oral route with L. casei died between days 8 and 10 after infection (no mice survived from a total of 9 mice), while most mice immunized with L. casei-Int cv died between days 11 and 12 after infection. At day 14 after infection, three mice (from a total of 13 mice) remained alive, and none of them displayed any sign of disease. Similarly, immunization of mice with L. casei-Int cv through the s.l. route significantly extended the mean survival time of the group compared with the immunization of mice with L. casei (P \u03ed 0.007). Mice that received L. casei through the s.l. route died between days 8 and 11 (no mice survived from a total of 10 mice), while the majority of animals from the L. casei-Int cv group died between days 11 and 14 (no mice survived from a total of 7 mice) (Fig. 6B) . However, in this case, no mice survived the challenge. Sections of the colons from mice immunized through both the oral and s.l. routes with L. casei and L. casei-Int cv were prepared 9 days after infection and were stained for the detection of C. rodentium. At this time point, the differences observed between the animals from the L. casei or the L. casei-Int cv group regarding the signs of disease were more evident. Colon sections collected from all infected mice were positive for C. rodentium staining (Fig. 7C to J) . However, damage to the intestinal epithelium was clearly in an advanced stage in mice immunized with L. casei by the oral and s.l. routes 9 days after challenge. At this stage, C. rodentium staining was observed in deep regions of the crypts (Fig. 7C to F). Conversely, mice immunized with L. casei-Int cv displayed a more preserved structure of the intestinal epithelium, and C. rodentium staining was observed in superficial layers (Fig. 7G to J) .",

            "text": "Oral vaccines against gastrointestinal infections usually require a delivery system able to protect the antigen from the aggressive environment found at the mucosa. Several strategies are designed to optimize antigen presentation and the induction of immune responses, which may improve protection. Lactic acid bacteria can resist passage through the gastrointestinal tract, are usually safe when administered through mucosal routes, and have the potential to express heterologous antigens. All these characteristics make them attractive alternatives for the development of mucosal live vaccines. L. casei strains expressing several heterologous antigens have been tested as vaccines in animal models, with promising results (2, 16, 24, 32, 42, 54) . In a previous work, we engineered L. casei to express the Int cv fragment from \u2424-intimin (L. casei-Int cv ). Nasal immunization of mice with the recombinant L. casei elicited antibodies that were able to bind to the EPEC surface and inhibited bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells in vitro (25) . The efficacy of subcutaneous immunization of mice with the Int cv fragment against colonization with the murine pathogen C. rodentium was shown in the present work, confirming the protective potential of such a fragment in vivo. L. casei-Int cv was therefore tested here as live oral and s.l. vaccines in mice against infections with C. rodentium. The s.l. route has been used for many years as an effective way to deliver low-molecular-weight drugs (71) and small immunogenic peptides, eliciting systemic responses (10) . The maintenance of the formulation in the s.l. mucosa prior to swallowing allows antigen uptake by dendritic cells that are present in the thin s.l. epithelium (53) . Modulation of the immune system after administration of different lactobacillus species by the s.l. route in mice has been described, especially for animal models of allergy (44, 65, 66) . However, the use of this route for vaccination, using recombinant lactic acid bacteria expressing heterologous antigens, has been less explored (22) .",

            "text": "Oral and s.l. immunization of mice with L. casei-Int cv did not induce significantly higher concentrations of anti-Int cv IgG in sera than controls. Still, vaccinated mice displayed significantly higher concentrations of anti-Int cv IgA in feces. Very few studies in the literature report the induction of anti-intimin IgA in gut mucosal sites, especially after mucosal immunization, and this effect usually requires the use of potent adjuvants or attenuated pathogens (14, 40) . Here, we have shown that L. casei-Int cv vaccine formulations are capable of inducing specific IgA responses in the gut mucosa, the site of infection for pathogens that cause A/E lesions, without the use of additional adjuvants. In the present work, we used an L. casei strain expressing the Int cv fragment in the intracellular compartment. Different works have tested the efficacy of lactobacilli as vaccine vectors expressing heterologous antigens at different locations (67) . After a comparison of Lactobacillus plantarum expressing the C fragment of the tetanus toxin at different cellular locations (intracellular, secreted, or cell surface exposed), Reveneau and collaborators concluded that the immunization of mice by the oral or intranasal route with the strain that expressed the protein intracellularly was the best way to induce specific systemic and mucosal antibodies (61) . In our hands, the intracellular expression of Int cv was more efficient for inducing antibodies in mice than strains expressing the same antigen exposed on the cell surface. This may be related to undesirable processing of the antigen attached to the cell wall, resulting in the release of a great part of the heterologous protein into the growth medium (unpublished data from our group). In the case of the L. casei-Int cv strain, capture of the bacteria by antigen-presenting cells at mucosal surfaces should occur, resulting in the presentation of Int cv peptides by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and the induction of antibody-producing cells. In the context of the common mucosal immune system (CMIS), secretion of antibodies at distant effector sites, as well as the induction of systemic antibodies (as occurs after sublingual immunization, for example), takes place. Challenge of immunized mice showed that the L. casei-Int cv oral or s.l. vaccine significantly decreased intestinal colonization by C. rodentium. This effect was more evident in mice that received L. casei-Int cv through the s.l. route, as this group showed a decrease in C. rodentium recovery from feces from the 4th day after infection until the 10th day after challenge. In this work, we have not evaluated bacterial colonization in intestinal tissues of C57BL/6 mice, such as the colon or cecum, because this would hamper the analysis of colonization kinetics in each animal. In previous works, Wiles and collaborators used bioluminescence imaging to follow C. rodentium (using bioluminescent strains that derive from the DBS100 strain) infection of C57BL/6 na\u00efve mice and observed a pattern very similar to what we have observed in the present work. According to their results, the highest in vivo signal of bacterial infection could be detected on day 8 postinfection. This was accompanied by a plateau in bacterial shedding from stools. Bioluminescence started to decrease on day 10 postinfection, and a very low signal was observed in only one animal on day 15 postinfection (69) . Moreover, a tight correlation between bioluminescence and CFU counts obtained from stools was observed (68) . These results confirm that bacterial recovery from feces reflects the burden of C. rodentium infection in C57BL/6 mice and support our analysis.",

            "text": "In a previous work, Maaser and collaborators (43) showed that clearance of C. rodentium colonization by nonimmunized mice is dependent on the presence of IgG against the bacteria. Administration of sera from mice that recovered from C. rodentium colonization protected na\u00efve mice against infection. However, when IgG was depleted from these sera, protection was no longer observed (43) . Sublingual immunization of mice with the purified Int cv fragment induced significantly higher concentrations of anti-Int cv IgG in sera but no anti-Int cv IgA in feces. The vaccine significantly reduced C. rodentium recovery from feces on the fourth day after challenge. However, this reduction was not maintained in the following days of collection compared with mice inoculated with saline. It is possible that the levels of IgG induced were not high enough to maintain low levels of colonization. When the same fragment was inoculated through the subcutaneous route, anti-Int cv IgG concentrations in sera were around 10 to 100 times higher than that observed in mice immunized through the s.l. route. Similar amounts of anti-Int cv IgG1 and IgG2a were observed in both immunizations (with IgG1/IgG2a ratios of 2.5 and 1.3 for the subcutaneous and s.l. immunization, respectively), indicating a balanced Th1/Th2 profile. However, only subcutaneous immunization with Int cv elicited significantly higher concentrations of anti-Int cv IgA. Thus, higher levels of total anti-Int cv IgG in sera and the induction of significant levels of anti-Int cv IgA in feces may have contributed to the reduction in C. rodentium recovery from feces in subcutaneously immunized mice throughout the experiment (see the supplemental material). On the other hand, in the L. casei system, protection elicited by L. casei-Int cv vaccines was observed even under conditions where no significant induction of anti-Int cv IgG in sera was detected. In addition, no anti-Int cv IgG was detected in mouse feces (data not shown). These data imply that other mechanisms are involved in the protection elicited by L. casei-Int cv oral and s.l. vaccines. The kinetics of IgA induction and C. rodentium CFU recovery from feces suggests that the localized anti-Int cv IgA response induced by L. casei-Int cv s.l. vaccine may have contributed to the lower number of bacteria observed after the early phases of infection by preventing or reducing initial attachment of the bacteria to the epithelial gut. Detection of these antibodies was progressively less after infection, and one possible explanation for this observation may be related to the consumption or the turnover of antibodies after infection. Interestingly, in the group of mice inoculated with saline, anti-Int cv IgA in feces could be detected 10 days after challenge with C. rodentium, a time point that precedes the clearance of the bacteria in our model. Other groups have described the induction of mucosal and systemic antibodies against C. rodentium antigens (including intimin) in na\u00efve mice, and this was followed by bacterial clearance (13, 30) . Despite these observations, we were not able to determine a significant negative correlation between C. rodentium recovery from feces and the concentrations of anti-Int cv IgA. Similar results were reported by Khare and colleagues (40) , who showed that an oral vaccine based on attenuated Salmonella enterica expressing intimin was able to induce IgA in feces and to reduce E. coli O157:H7 shedding in cattle. In their study, the magnitude of bacterial shedding also was not negatively correlated with the levels of anti-intimin IgA (40) .",

IL-6-deficient mice failed to control C. rodentium intestinal colonization and displayed an increase in the apoptosis of epithelial colon cells with subsequent ulcerations after infection. Higher mortality rates were observed in these mice than in wild-type mice (21) . Infection of human epithelial colon cells with EPEC strains activates the NF-B transcription factor, a key element in the regulation of il-6 gene transcription (63) . Together, these results suggest that the mechanisms of IL-6 expression in bacterial intestinal infections work similarly in humans and mice and play an important role in protection against these pathogens. In our experiments, a significant increase in IL-6 secretion by spleen cells 10 days after challenge was observed only in C57BL/6 mice immunized with L. casei-Int cv through the s.l. route, the group which showed the best reduction in C. rodentium colonization. In addition, secretion of IFN-\u2425 by spleen cells was also significantly higher in this group of mice than in control groups. This cytokine was also described as a key factor for protection against these pathogens, and its expression was increased in cells from colons of mice infected with C. rodentium (34, 43) .",

C. rodentium infection causes inflammation in colon mucosa (43) . In C3H mice, this effect is particularly severe, with more prominent submucosal edema, epithelial damage, crypt hyperplasia, and goblet cell depletion (64) . Analysis of colon sections obtained from C3H/HePas mice immunized by both routes 9 days after challenge revealed that mice that received the L. casei-Int cv vaccines showed less epithelial damage and ulceration at this time point than L. casei-vaccinated mice. C. rodentium staining was localized more superficially in the intestinal epithelia from mice immunized with L. casei-Int cv , whereas bacterial staining was observed in deep regions of intestinal crypts from mice immunized with L. casei. However, later on, the severity of erosions and the epithelial damage in L. casei-Int cv -vaccinated mice probably reached the levels observed in colon sections of L. casei-vaccinated animals, since almost all mice succumbed to infection.",
