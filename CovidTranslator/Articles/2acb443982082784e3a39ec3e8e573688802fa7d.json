Both the JHM and A59 strains, when inoculated intracranially or intranasally, are neurovirulent. Comparison of the highly virulent JHM isolate, JHM.SD, with less virulent JHM isolates and with A59 has been used to determine the mechanisms and genes responsible for high neuropathogenicity of MHV. The focus of this review is on the contributions of viral spread, replication, and innate and adaptive immunity to MHV neuropathogenesis. JHM.SD spreads more quickly among neurons than less neurovirulent MHVs, and is able to spread in the absence of the canonical MHV receptor, CEACAM1a. The observation that JHM.SD infects more cells and expresses more antigen, but produces less infectious virus per cell than A59, implies that efficient replication is not always a correlate of high neurovirulence. This is likely due to the unstable nature of the JHM.SD spike protein (S). JHM.SD induces a generally protective innate immune response; however, the strong neutrophil response may be more pathogenic than protective. In addition, JHM.SD induces only a minimal T-cell response, whereas the strong T-cell response and the concomitant interferon-c (IFN-c) induced by the less neurovirulent A59 is protective. Differences in the S and nucleocapsid (N) proteins between A59 and JHM.SD contribute to JHM.SD neuropathogenicity. The hemmagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein may enhance neuropathogenicity of some MHV isolates, but is unlikely a major contributor to the high neuroviruence of JHM.SD. Further data suggest that neither the internal (I) protein nor nonstructural proteins ns4, and ns2 are significant contributors to neurovirulence. Journal of NeuroVirology (2010) 16, 427-434.",

A59 causes moderate to severe hepatitis and in the brain, mild encephalitis and demyelination (Lavi et al, 1984; Phillips et al, 1999) ; MHV-induced demyelination provides a model for multiple sclerosis. Infectious A59 is generally cleared by 10 days post intracranial inoculation, after which mice develop demyelination peaking at 3 to 4 weeks post infection (Houtman and Fleming, 1996b; Matthews et al, 2001; Sutherland et al, 1997) . JHM was isolated from a paralyzed mouse (Cheever et al, 1949) and subsequently serially passaged in mouse brains, after which various clones were isolated. The use of multiple JHM clones, with different levels of neurovirulence, by various laboratories has necessitated the use of additional nomenclature to distinguish among these isolates. JHM.SD (formerly designated as MHV-4) (Ontiveros et al, 2003) , the focus of this review, is among the most neurovirulent isolates (Fazakerley et al, 1992; Gallagher et al, 1990) , causing lethal encephalitis. An intracranial inoculation with only a few plaque-forming units (PFU) of JHM.SD kills nearly all the infected mice within about 1 week. Like A59, JHM induces demyelinating disease in the surviving mice (Lampert et al, 1973; Perlman et al, 1987; Weiner, 1973) .",

Dales et al was observed to move transneuronaly in a primarily retrograde movement with some anterograde movement as well (Pasick et al, 1994) . The availability of reverse genetics systems has promoted the mapping of pathogenic properties to viral genes. Analysis of A59/JHM chimeric viruses demonstrated that the spike protein is largely responsible for the rapid spread of JHM. Replacement of the spike gene of A59 with that of JHM (rA59/S JHM ) confers increased spread in the brain and in primary hippocampal neurons, and conversely replacement of the JHM spike gene with that of A59 (rJHM/S A59 ) results in reduced spread in the brain (Iacono et al, 2006; Phillips et al, 2002) . Some JHM isolates with spike mutations are attenuated for encephalitis, but still induce demyelination. One such isolate, JHM2.2-V-1, was selected as an escape variant for neutralization by anti-spike monoclonal antibody J2.2. It has an L1114F amino acid substitution in the spike and is glial tropic; it fails to infect neurons, which most likely explains its attenuation for encephalitis (Wang et al, 1992) . In the context of JHM/A59 chimeric viruses, the nucleocapsid protein of JHM also confers increases in the extent of viral antigen expressed in the brain; however, the mechanism is uncertain and nucleocapsid protein does not enhance neuron-to-neuron spread in primary hippocampal neuron cultures (Cowley et al, 2010) .",

This was originally demonstrated in tissue culture (Gallagher et al, 1992; Taguchi et al, 1999) and more recently in primary hippocampal neuron cultures . A very small number of cells in primary neuronal cultures derived from ceacam1a \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were infected by A59 or JHM.

When inoculated at equivalent PFU, A59 and JHM.SD replicate to similar titers in the brain, even though JHM.SD is more lethal and expresses more intracellular antigen in the CNS (Cowley et al, 2010; MacNamara et al, 2005; Phillips et al, 1999) . In addition, recombinant A59 expressing the JHM.SD spike gene (rA59/S JHM ) replicates to lower final titers than A59, even though, like JHM. SD, it has an LD 50 of less than 10 PFU and spreads more efficiently in the CNS than A59 (Phillips et al, 1999) . This may be due to the unstable nature of the JHM.SD spike protein, which can lead to receptorindependent conformational changes and premature inactivation (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001; Krueger et al, 2001) . Consistent with this, the JHM. SD spike is more sensitive to heat and high pH treatments (Tsai et al, 2003) . Perhaps as a consequence, JHM.SD produces more virus particles per PFU than A59 (unpublished data) and replicates to significantly 100-to 1000-fold lower titers in tissue culture (Cowley et al, 2010; Phillips et al, 1999) . However, titer is indicative of disease severity in some cases, when comparing two viruses expressing the same spike protein. For example, recombinant A59 expressing the JHM nucleocapsid (rA59/N JHM ) is more lethal and infects more cells in the CNS than A59, and this is associated with greater replication in the brain (Cowley et al, 2010) .",

The robust macrophage infiltration induced by JHM.SD partially maps to the JHM.SD spike gene, as evidenced by the greater level of macrophage recruitment in the CNS of rA59/S JHM -infected mice as compared with A59-infected animals (Rempel et al. 2004b; Scott et al, 2008) .",

The combination of cytokines and MMPs causes disruption of the blood-brain barrier, which facilitates the entry of mononuclear cells (Zhou et al, 2002) . JHM.SD infection leads to the recruitment of greater numbers of neutrophils than A59 infection, likely a result of the increased level of MIP-2 during JHM infection (Iacono et al, 2006; Rempel et al, 2004a; Scott et al, 2008) . Depletion of neutrorophils during infection with the more attenuated DM variant of JHM resulted in a reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration, increased viral replication, and increased lethality, leading to the conclusion that neutrophils were protective against MHV infection . However, although neutrophils are important in early control of virus, they can be pathogenic in generating toxic reactive oxygen species. Indeed, the greater recruitment of neutrophils during JHM.SD infection compared to A59 was demonstrated to be more destructive than protective (Iacono et al, 2006) . Natural killer cells also enter the brain early in infection. They secrete IFN-g, which may assist in clearing virus early in infection before the adaptive immune response develops (Iacono et al, 2006; Rempel et al, 2004a) .",

JHM.SD induces a weak T-cell response, whereas the less virulent JHM 2.2-V-1 and A59 induce robust responses (Iacono et al, 2006; Marten et al, 2003; Rempel et al, 2004a) . Quantification of virus specific T cells after JHM 2.2-V-1 infection showed that priming and the initiation of T-cell expansion occurs in the cervical lymph nodes (CLNs). Dendritic cells (DCs) carrying virus or viral antigen migrate from the brain to the CLNs where antigen-specific T-cell priming is believed to occur (Dorries, 2001; Stevenson et al, 1997) ; treatment of DCs with pertussis toxin prevents them from migrating from the CLNs and, in turn, prevents T-cell trafficking into the brain (Karman et al, 2004) . After initial expansion in the CLNs, T cells expand further in the spleen before trafficking to the brain . Infectious JHM.SD is barely detectable in CLNs, whereas A59 viral titers are much higher (Macnamara et al, 2008) . The induction of a robust T-cell response does not map to spike, as rA59/S JHM induces a strong T-cell response and infectious viral titers similar to A59 are detected in CLNs (Cowley et al, 2010; Iacono et al, 2006; Macnamara et al, 2008; Rempel et al, 2004b) . The cytolytic activity as well as the production of IFN-g by CD8 T cells are crucial for the ability to clear infection from the CNS (Marten et al, 2001; Parra et al, 1999) . Whereas perforin is important for clearance from astrocytes (Lin et al, 1997; Parra et al, 2001) , IFN-g facilitates cytolytic killing by up-regulating MHC expression on infected cells and mediates clearance from oligodendrocytes Parra et al, 1999) . The mechanism of viral clearance from neurons is not yet known.",

Several other MHV proteins have been investigated as candidate virulence determinants. Two MHV nonstructural proteins, ns2 and ns5a, have been implicated in type I interferon antagonism (Koetzner et al, 2010; Zhao and Weiss, unpublished data) . ns2 is predicted to have cyclic phosphodiesterase (CDP) activity. Mutations in either of two predicted catalytic histidines of ns2 of A59 confer the loss of the ability to replicate in the liver, but have no affect on neurovirulence or in vitro replication (Roth-Cross et al, 2009) . Similarly, a deletion of the ns2 gene of JHM had no affect on replication in vitro (Schwarz et al, 1990) , and had no detectable effect on virulence after intracranial inoculation (personal communication, J. Leibowitz and S. Perlman). These data suggest that either the ability to resist interferon signaling is not as important in the CNS as in the liver or that resistance to interferon signaling by MHV is mediated through a different mechanism in the CNS. ns5a, like ns2, is nonessential for replication in vitro (Yokomori and Lai, 1991) , but its role in neurovirulence has not been reported.",

Mutation of the predicted catalytic residue in the ADRP domain of nsp3 of A59 does not alter the ability of virus to replicate in vitro or the CNS (unpublished data); however, interestingly, such mutations confer reduced replication in the liver (Eriksson et al, 2008) . Abrogation of the internal protein (I) expression in the A59 genome had no affect on replication in the CNS (Fischer et al, 1997) or lethality after intracranial inoculation (unpublished data), and JHM ablated for ns4 expression was similar in lethality and CNS replication as wild-type virus (Ontiveros et al, 2001) .",

In addition, it is not fully understood how viral strain differences in the innate immune response may affect pathogenesis.
