The use of Sf9 cells for efficient MrNV replication and propagation was demonstrated by confocal microscopy and PCR amplification, through which early viral binding and internalization were initially detectable at 30 min post-infection; whereas at 72 h, the distinguishable sign of late-MrNV infection was observable as the gradual accumulation of a cytopathic effect (CPE) in the cells, ultimately resulting in cellular disruption. Moreover, during the early period of infection, the MrNV signals were highly co-localized with CAV1 signals of the CAV-mediated endocytosis pathway. The use of genistein as an inhibitor of the CAV-mediated endocytosis pathway significantly reduced MrNV and CAV1 co-localization, and also reduced the levels of MrNV infection in Sf9 cells as shown by PCR and ELISA. Moreover, the addition of the pathway agonist okadaic acid not only recovered but also augmented both the levels of MrNV co-localization with CAV1 and of Sf9 infection in the presence of genistein inhibition; therefore demonstrating that MrNV infection in Sf9 cells was associated with the CAV-mediated endocytosis pathway machinery.",

            "text": "Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus (MrNV) is one of the known causative agents of white tail disease (WTD) in the giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii. Early WTD can be observed as the appearance of a whitish coloration in the muscles of post-larvae (PL) prawns. The later stages of the disease manifests as a sudden, 100% rate of mortality of PL in the rearing ponds, resulting in extensive damage to closed-hatchery giant freshwater prawn aquaculture (Azad et al., 2005; Bonami et al., 2005) . Regarding the causative virus, MrNV is a 30 nm, non-enveloped icosahedral virus containing a linear bipartite positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA+) genome. Similar to other nodaviruses, MrNV has been shown to infect a broad spectrum of cells and organisms, ranging from mosquito cell cultures (C6/36) and aquatic insects to other types of prawn such as Penaeus monodon and Litopenaeus van-namei (Hayakijkosol and Owens, 2013; Sahul Hameed et al., 2004; Sudhakaran et al., 2008; Sudhakaran et al., 2007b) .",

Nevertheless, studies into the actual process of viral entry and infection at the intracellular level have been constrained by difficulties in maintaining stable primary cell cultures of aquatic organisms (Lu et al., 1995) . Furthermore, these difficulties have been compounded by the lack of reliable continuous crustacean cell lines that would otherwise permit the long-term observations required for studying MrNV infection and replication pathways. Recent studies utilizing continuous mosquito cell lines have somewhat useful in studying MrNV infection and propagation; nevertheless, the maintenance of this particular cell line for long-term culture still proved problematic. To overcome the aforementioned difficulties, we have demonstrated the susceptibility of an insect cell line, Sf9, to MrNV infection; in addition, demonstrated the use of the cell line to facilitate in-depth studies of viral infection pathway.",

            "text": "In general, the early phase of the infection pathway of nonenveloped viruses involves the receptor-based attachment of viral particles to the targeted cell surface, followed by the internalization of the virus into the cytoplasm. The viral entry of alpha-nodaviruses, in particular the entry of the flock house virus (FHV) into Drosophila melanogaster culture cells, serves as a useful starting model for further insightful investigations into the mechanism of entry of other members of the nodavirus family (Odegard et al., 2010) , (Walukiewicz et al., 2006) . When compared to FHV, however, limited information is available regarding the early process of MrNV infection in its natural hosts or in susceptible insect cell cultures. Given the similar icosahedral structures of both viruses, it is therefore tempting to assume that MrNV follows a similar process of endosome-dependent host-cell entry as that of its nodavirus counterparts and of non-enveloped viruses that infect mammalian cells. Small ssRNA viruses such as the picornaviruses have been extensively reported to interchangeably utilize clathrin (CLA)-and caveolin (CAV)-mediated endocytosis, whereas other similar viruses such as the poliovirus have been found to not be dependent on either pathway (Brandenburg et al., 2007; Hogle, 2002) . Accordingly, further in-depth studies into the process of entry and trafficking of MrNV is required. For those purposes, the selection of host cells that reliably demonstrates susceptibility to viral infection, replication, propagation as well as permit long-term viral pathway studies would therefore be crucial.",

At 2 h p.i., the red fluorescent signals of anti-MrNV were highly concentrated in the peripheral cytoplasm of the infected Sf9 cells in varying patterns of distribution and degrees of intensity ( Fig. 2F and N, red) . Interestingly, the levels of anti-CAV1 was initially low in the non-infected cells ( Fig. 2A) , but were drastically increased in the 2-h MrNV-infected cells (Fig. 2E) . Particularly, staining signals of anti-CAV1 were mostly co-localized with anti-MrNV signals in the submembranous areas of the cells (demonstrated by the overlapping of green and red fluorescent signals to become yellowish-orange signals) (Fig. 2H) . The staining of anti-CLA which was also at the low level in the non-infected cells (Fig. 2I ) remained unchanged and minimally colocalized with anti-MrNV in the MrNV infected cells (Fig. 2P) .

The levels of MrNV protein and CAV1 in the infected Sf9 cells was checked by immunofluorescence microscopy and ELISA. An apparent cease of MrNV together with CAV1 staining signals in the Sf9 cells were evident upon treating with genistein ( Fig. 3I-H) . Quantitative ELISA results also confirmed significant reduction of MrNV protein by 2.8-fold (Fig. 4A) upon genistein treatment. These inhibitory effects of genistein on MrNV infection were overturned when the Sf9 cells were concurrently treated with 30 nM okadaic acid, a known CAV-mediated endocytotic pathway agonist. The Sf9 cells treated with okadaic acid after genistein inhibition exhibited the higher MrNV and CAV1 staining signals ( Fig. 3M -P) and its augmentation of the infection level as reflected by an ELISA results (Fig. 4A, dotted bar) . It should be noted that the augmented anti-MrNV fluorescent signals was notably co-localized with anti-CAV1 staining signals in the submembranous vicinity (Fig. 3P ). Sf9 cell treatment with okadaic acid alone gave a similar result as those pretreated with genistein followed by okadaic acid (data not shown). In addition, Sf9 cells treated with CLA inhibitor (chlorpromazine) or CLA agonist (transferrin) did not markedly affected MrNV infection ( Supplementary Fig. S1 in the online version at DOI: 10.1016/ j.virusres.2016.06.012). We also measured the mRNA level of the infected MrNV in the Sf9 cells treated with genistein and/or okadaic acid. The levels of MrNV RNA at the band of 1.1 kbp in the PCR amplification were significantly reduced by \u223c2.7-fold in the genistein treated group compared with the untreated MrNV-infected cells (Fig. 4B) . Recovery of MrNV infection and its augmentation by okadaic acid (Fig. 4B) well agreed with the ELISA results mentioned above. Altogether, these results suggested that the MrNV appeared to highly associate with CAV1-positive structures during the early infection period, and that the levels of internalization and infection of MrNV in Sf9 cells could be interfered with substances that either inhibited or re-activated the CAV-mediated endocytosis pathway.",

MrNV protein immunoreactivity at 42 kDa could readily be visualized at 2 h p.i. and its band intensity was greatly enhanced at 72 h p.i. Likewise, detection of MrNV RNA could also be evident at 1.1 kbp band at the 2-h p.i. The intensity level of this band drastically increased at 72 h p.i., signifying a robust amplification of virion number within the infected cells. This relatively fast replication of this virus within Sf9 cells indicate that the cultured Sf9 insect cells are highly susceptible cells that facilitate further in-depth studies into MrNV or other nodavirus internalization and replication processes.",

            "text": "Studies of the MrNV viral infection pathway have encountered difficulties regarding the availability of stable cell lines from aquatic animals (Jose et al., 2010) . Apart from the lack of stable cell lines from naturally susceptible organisms, other complications include an isolation of potent viral inoculum; as MrNV inoculum has to be obtained from post-larva prawn through the identification of the white discoloration in the infected muscle tissues (Bonami et al., 2005; Owens et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2008) . This difficulty is due to the fact that infected adult animals are sometimes asymptomatic and capable of viral clearance in varying degrees (Ravi et al., 2010) . In addition, an isolated MrNV inoculum is sometimes contaminated with other pathogens that do not contribute to the occurrence or progression of WTD (Qian et al., 2003; Sahul Hameed et al., 2004; Sudhakaran et al., 2007a; Zhang et al., 2006) . In regard to culture systems for MrNV infection-susceptible cells and tissues; primary cultures of hemocytes or hematopoietic tissues in crustaceans have been established for the observation of viral infection (Jie Du et al., 2012) . However, isolated hemocytes and hematopoietic tissues of crustaceans have to been shown to be limited in long-term stability, and hence do not facilitate extended observations of viral infection. Furthermore, other cell culture systems have exhibited varying degrees of susceptibility or permissivity to MrNV. In fact, some cell cultures such as C6/36, while susceptible to MrNV infection, are deemed to be non-permissive or unable to allow the virus particles to propagate over time, while those that allow for limited propagation are described as semi-permissive (Hayakijkosol and Owens, 2013) . To circumvent the problem of unstable infected-tissue cultures, we successfully utilized the continuous Sf9 insect cell line for MrNV replication and propagation, which further allowed us to investigate MrNV infection and subsequent internalization events.",

These signs of CPE have also been reported in MrNV-infected C3/36 mosquito cell lines (Hayakijkosol and Owens, 2013; Sudhakaran et al., 2007b) , SISE embryonic sea bass cell lines and SSN-1 snakehead fish cell lines (Hernandez-Herrera et al., 2007) . More importantly, we have shown by RT-PCR and ELISA that the number of virions significantly increased over an extended period (Fig. 4) . Moreover, the specific replicating site of MrNV as visualized by immunogold TEM localization was confined to the membrane bound endosomal-like vesicles, signifying CPE in the infected Sf9 cells (Fig. 6) . These results corroborated with similar electron microscopic findings in MrNV-infected SISE and C3/36 cell lines in which MrNV particles gathered in large, membrane-bound organelles (Hayakijkosol and Owens, 2013; Sudhakaran et al., 2007b) . Our preliminary results also showed that MrNV that had replicated in Sf9 cells can be collected as inoculum to infect other Sf9 cells and prawn, suggesting the horizontal propagation ability of this virus. Nonetheless, the vertical permissiveness of the Sf9 cell culture to the virus through repeated culture passages requires further investigation.",

Firstly, the corresponding up-regulation between MrNV and CAV1 as well as their highly co-localized patterns under confocal microscopy at 2 h infection. Secondly, the results revealed the ability of tyrosine phosphorylation inhibitor, genistein, to virtually halt the internalization of MrNV particles, although specific inhibitors of other process within the endocytosis pathway need to be employed to provide conclusive evidence of the involvement of the CAV-mediated endocytosis pathway. Thirdly, MrNV infection could be quickly recovered and even further augmented by the pathway agonist okadaic acid (Figs. 3 and 4) . Applications of genistein and okadaic acid as a potent inhibitor and agonist, respectively, of the CAV-mediated endocytotic pathway have been reported in many previous studies, in particular those pertaining to viral infections (Damm et al., 2005; Parton et al., 1994; Thomsen et al., 2002) . These results correlate well with the findings in ssRNA+ viruses such as Human coronavirus 229E (Nomura et al., 2004) and Echovirus-1 (Marjomaki et al., 2002) which have been shown to be dependent on CAV-mediated endocytosis for internalization. While our results did suggest that MrNV infection in Sf9 cells were associated with the CAV-mediated endocytotic machinery, whether the viruses do internalize via caveosome-like structures at the ultra-high resolution microscopy is currently under investigation. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of using Sf9 insect cell line for MrNV replication and propagation, and that MrNV internalization favored more the CAV-mediated endocytostic pathway which would facilitate further detailed studies of MrNV infection/replication in this host cell line in the future. ence, Mahidol University under the National Research University Initiative (NRU).
