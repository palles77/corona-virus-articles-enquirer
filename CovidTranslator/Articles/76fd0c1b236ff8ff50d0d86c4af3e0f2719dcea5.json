This may be a factor in nosocomial spread, explaining in part the recent worldwide emergence of MDR A. baumannii. 1, 2 The benefit of contact precautions for the control of gram-negative pathogens has been debated. [14] [15] [16] We found that protective gloves reduced the incidence of transfer of MDR A. baumannii to the hands of HCWs 8-fold, from 36.2% to 4.5%. This reduction in transfer to hands emphasizes the potential benefit of the use of contact precautions for patients colonized or infected with MDR A. baumannii. Hand hygiene after the removal of gown and gloves remains important to address the 4.5% of HCWs with contaminated hands. HCWs removed gowns and gloves in a standard fashion and maintained precautions; however, incidental contact with gowns and/or gloves was observed, which likely explains the 4.5% frequency of contamination before hand hygiene.",

On the basis of estimates from this simple model, even with 70% adherence to hand hygiene and 80% adherence to contact precautions (an ideal yet to be achieved in the majority of hospitals), 1 in every 30 HCW room entries results in MDR A. baumannii contamination, which is close to the 1.5% frequency of MDR A. baumannii contamination that we detected on HCW hands before room entry in our study. In the intensive care units where the study was conducted, more than 100 HCW room entries occur daily, and this number is reported in the literature as well. 14 A higher risk of contamination was observed when contact with a patient wound or mechanical ventilatory equipment occurred, portals commonly positive for MDR A. baumannii. 17 Longer time in a patient room was a risk likely related to having greater patient and environmental exposure. A higher incidence of contamination of physicians or nurses, compared with the incidence of contamination of specialty therapists, is especially concerning, because physicians typically see more patients and have lower rates of hand hygiene than other HCWs. 18 In our hospital, wound care is performed by nurses. This may explain the higher rate of transmission to nurses, compared with the rate of transmission to specialty therapists, which includes physical and occupational therapists who do not have patient contact as extensive as that of nurses. Increased transmission with wound contact and ventilator equipment emphasizes the importance of secretions from these areas and the need for good adherence to standard precautions in all patients, given that colonization with MDR A. baumannii is often not recognized.",
