Clinical Simulation in Nursing, 12(2), 51-61. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecns.2015.12.001. Simulation of various clinical situations is one teaching strategy used in nursing curricula. Simulation provides an opportunity for students not only to become competent in nursing-related skills required for the provision of care in acute settings (e.g., urinary catheter insertion) but also to gain additional skills from other academic disciplines and practice professions. Epidemiology is one such discipline; in this article, we present the development and implementation of a simulation to teach epidemiological concepts Clinical Simulation in Nursing (2016) 12, 51-61 www.elsevier.com/locate/ecsn and skills to undergraduate nurses. Simulation can ''replace or amplify real experiences with guided experiences that evoke or replicate substantial aspects of the real world in a fully interactive manner'' (Gaba, 2007, p. 126) . Simulations require students to actively participate, apply existing knowledge to problemsolving, and interact with peers and facilitators in high-fidelity settings. Simulation is a hallmark of the new undergraduate curriculum at the University of Pennsylvania (D' Antonio, Walsh Brennan, & Curley, 2013) and is used to some extent in every clinical course.",

In the revised undergraduate curriculum, Nursing in the Community is a two course unit clinical course (i.e., twice the size of a typical semesterlong course) taken at the beginning of the senior year. The goals of the revised Nursing in the Community course are to prepare students for public health nursing, community-based practice, and community-engaged practice. The syllabus and clinical placements for the course were informed by the core competencies established by the Quad Council, a coalition of four nursing organizations (The Public Health Foundation, 2014) . Mastery of these competencies, including public health skills such as epidemiology, is critical to improve the quality and rigor of public health nursing.",

Although most of the simulation hours in the course focus on typical clinical scenarios in community or public health nursing (e.g., a home visit for a newborn and mother; a school-based clinic; a recently discharged patient with heart failure), we saw an additional opportunity to build competencies in epidemiology and public health through simulation. Notably, ten of the >30 hours of simulation in the revised Nursing in the Community course are focused on two epidemiologic (vs. clinical) scenarios in which nursing students take on the role of a nurse epidemiologist. In the first, students serve on an outbreak investigation team for a rapidly emerging infectious disease in a fictional city; in the second, they assess a national cervical cancer screening program in a Sub-Saharan African country.

We planned a 5-to 6-hour experience during which groups of five to seven students would work together on real-time deliverables related to the investigation of the outbreak. With our learning objectives as an end point, we worked backward to identify assignments and deliverables that would demonstrate content mastery.

The fictionalized scenario was based on the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto, Canada. The simulation has been piloted and run three times as of summer 2015. An ongoing evaluation and revision process incorporates instructor observations, student feedback, and student evaluation. Wolf (2008) found that simulation-based learning in the health professions has proven to be an effective way to integrate didactic and clinical material, particularly in settings and for situations that students are unlikely to encounter during clinical placements. Ensuring that nursing students are prepared to assist in public health emergencies, such as rapid-onset infectious disease outbreaks, is a high priority. This was made very clear to us in fall 2014 when we ran the simulation at the height of the West Africa Ebola outbreak. Indeed, one of the major challenges to containing the Ebola outbreak was lack of sufficient training in outbreak investigation, including contact tracing and public health communication (Summers, Nyenswah, Montgomery, Neatherlin, & Tappero, 2014) dtwo skills that are central to this simulation providing an opportunity for nursing students to learn these skills in a simulated environment is an appropriate and effective way to build the public health nursing workforce and enhance the capacity of all nurses to provide care to communities in crisis. The experience developing and implementing the simulation offers some important lessons for instructors with similar pedagogical goals for BSN courses in community and public health nursing.",

Some background in epidemiology and public health is helpful to answer questions about, for example, calculating attack rates and case fatality rates or interpreting an epidemic curve. If the simulation is staffed at a minimal level, a detailed instructor manual and use of a courseware discussion board during the simulation can help. Grading the simulation is also time consuming given the number of assignments and, in a large class, the number of teams. We shifted part of the grading burden to students by having them assess peer participation.",

We have been fortunate to be able to schedule sufficient breakout rooms for all student groups in the same classroom building as the lecture hall. Most of our breakout rooms are equipped with computers, and we recommend that students bring a laptop or tablet. We observed that available technology did affect collaboration style. For example, in some groups, each student had a laptop and worked independently. In groups where not every student had a laptop, subgroups were formed with two to three students working together on one laptop with more discussion and verbal communication. In breakout rooms with a large projection screen, students often projected work in progress from a shared Google document so that the full group could contribute. These groups demonstrated the most engagement and spent the least amount of time collating and submitting assignments.",

We have trialed three different modes of disseminating materials to student groups during the simulation: e-mail, paper plus Web, and Web only.

We have determined that a paperless simulation delivered through our existing courseware is feasible, acceptable, and effective. We remain intrigued by the student suggestion to migrate the simulation from courseware to Google forms. With additional resources, we are confident that a stand alone (i.e., not within courseware) solution could be developed that would facilitate broader dissemination and adoption.",

One advantage of this is that data about the outbreak are widely available and several published studies review the investigation in detail. However, as we prepared to run the simulation in fall 2014, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was at its height, garnering considerable media attention and student interest. We debated rewriting the simulation to focus on the Ebola outbreak to capitalize on this timelines and salience. However, we quickly deemed this unfeasible given the resources needed to develop a new, high-fidelity simulation. We did mention the Ebola outbreak during debrief and linked the outbreak investigation skills needed in West Africa to the tasks and assignments the students had just completed in the simulation. We noted that student interest and engagement in the simulation was highest in fall 2014 compared with other semesters, with more students mentioning the relevance of the materials in evaluation forms.",

We quickly realized that her deep familiarity with the simulation as lead author was difficult to transfer, even with a detailed Instructor Manual, and with three instructors having participated in the pilot. The lead author then served as a lead facilitator in fall 2014 and summer 2015, but we have set an explicit goal for the Course Director, Associate Course Director, and Course Instructor to be comfortable running the simulation going forward. To ensure longevity and sustainability of the simulation without compromising its validity or pedagogical value, we plan to recruit epidemiology and nursing doctoral students to join the simulation team as facilitators, expand the existing instructor manual with detailed stepby-step instructions for simulation delivery to facilitate course faculty's ability to run the simulation with confidence and ease, and transition the lead facilitator role to permanent course faculty over the next year.",

We will continue to view simulation development as an iterative process and revise it to address student feedback and the realities of class size and available time. In response to overwhelming student feedback, the next major revision we will undertake is to change the courseware settings so that teams can move through the simulation at their own pace. We are sensitive to the fact that this may diminish the ''real time'' feel of the simulation which may alter the students' overall experience in an outbreak investigation simulation. At the same time, we believe a self-paced version will facilitate implementation. We are investigating opportunities and available resources to package the simulation for wider dissemination and hope that it will be adopted by other nursing programs.",
