In this study we demonstrate that muNS processing is catalyzed by a caspase 3-like protease activated during the course of avian reovirus infection. The cleavage site was mapped by site directed mutagenesis between residues Asp-154 and Ala-155 of the muNS sequence. Although muNS and muNSC, but not muNSN, are able to form inclusions when expressed individually in transfected cells, only muNS is able to recruit specific ARV proteins to these structures. Furthermore, muNSC associates with ARV factories more weakly than muNS, sigmaNS and lambdaA. Finally, the inhibition of caspase activity in ARV-infected cells does not diminish ARV gene expression and replication, but drastically reduces muNS processing and the release and dissemination of progeny viral particles.",

Infection by these viruses has been associated with a variety of disease conditions, including viral arthritis, chronic respiratory diseases, and malabsorption syndrome (Jones, 2000; van der Heide, 2000) . ARVs are members of the Orthoreovirus genus, one of the 12 genera of the Reoviridae family. They are non-enveloped fusogenic viruses whose particles contain 10 double-stranded RNA genome segments enclosed within two concentric protein shells (Benavente and Martinez-Costas, 2007) . Viral genomic segments can be separated electrophoretically into three different size classes, named L (Large; three segments), M (Medium; three segments) and S (Small; four segments). The ARV genome expresses at least 8 structural and four non-structural proteins (Bodelon et al., 2001) , but the protein repertoire of ARV is increased to at least 12 structural proteins and six non-structural proteins by posttranslational cleavage of some viral proteins (Busch et al., 2011; Ji et al., 2010; Varela et al., 1996) .",

Apoptosis is triggered by ARV in the absence of viral gene expression, but is no longer induced when intracellular viral uncoating is blocked, suggesting both that apoptosis does not depend on viral protein synthesis and that it is triggered from within the infected cell by viral products generated after intraendosomal uncoating of parental reovirions (Labrada et al., 2002) . A previous report revealed that the M3 gene of ARV expresses three muNS isoforms in infected cells and that the two smaller isoforms originate by a specific post-translational cleavage near the amino terminus of muNS. This cleavage produces a 55-kDa carboxyterminal protein, termed muNSC, and a complementary 17-kDa aminoterminal polypeptide, designated muNSN. Cleavage of muNS occurs with $30% efficiency, so precursor muNS and its cleavage products are all present in ARV-infected cells (Busch et al., 2011) . In this study we show that muNS processing is indirectly promoted by ARV infection through activation of an effector caspase that cleaves muNS between amino acid residues 154 and 155.",

To assess whether muNS cleavage is promoted by avian reovirus proteins and/or by changes induced in the host during infection, we compared muNS-to-muNSC conversion in ARV-infected cells with that in transfected cells and in insect cells infected with a muNSexpressing recombinant baculovirus (Fig. 1A ). For this, extracts from CEF monolayers either mock-infected (lane 1) or infected with ARV S1133 (lane 2), from CEF monolayers transfected with either empty pCINeo plasmid (lane 3) or pCINeo-muNS plasmid (lane 4), and from Sf9 cells infected with either wild-type baculovirus (lane 5) or recombinant baculovirus AcNPV-S1133-muNS (lane 6) were subjected to immunoprecipitation (upper panel) and immunoblot (lower panel) analyses. The results revealed that while a significant amount of muNSC was generated in ARV-infected cells (its position is marked with an asterisk at the left of lane 2), this protein was hardly detected in transfected cells (lane 4) or in insect cells infected with a muNS-expressing recombinant baculovirus (lane 6).

In the first one, a plasmid expressing GFP fused to the amino terminus of muNS (GFP-muNS) was lipofected into CEF monolayers and 10 h later the monolayers were mockinfected or infected with ARV S1133 for 16 h. Extracts from these cells were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies specific for both muNS and GFP. The results shown in Fig. 1B reveal that while cleavage products derived from GFP-muNS are not detected in mock-infected cells (lanes 1 and 3) , a $ 45-kDa polypeptide that is recognized by antibodies against both GFP and muNS is present in ARV-infected cells (lanes 2 and 4). Its electrophoretic mobility and its capacity to interact with the two antibodies suggest that this polypeptide is GFP-muNSN. In the second confirmation experiment ( Fig. 1C) , 35 S-labeled in-vitro-generated muNS (lane 2) was incubated with extracts obtained from either mock-infected cells (lane 3) or ARV-infected cells (lane 4), and the resulting samples, as well as radiolabeled extracts from ARV-infected CEF that had been immunoprecipitated against muNS (lane 1), were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The results revealed that muNS-to-muNSC conversion took place in the sample incubated An immunoblot analysis of nonradiolabeled samples is shown in the lower panel. (B) CEF monolayers are transfected with GFP-muNS for 10 h and then mock-infected (lanes 1 and 3) or infected with 10 PFU/cell of ARV S1133 for 16 h (lanes 2 and 4).

(C) 35 S-radiolabeled in-vitro-synthesized muNS (lane 2) is incubated for 2 h at 37 1C with extracts from mock-infected cells (lane 3) or from ARV-infected cells (lane 4).

The membranes in lanes 1-4 and 6 are exposed for 5 s and the one in lane 5 for 30 s. with extracts from ARV-infected cells (lane 4), but not in the one incubated with extracts from mock-infected cells (lane 3).

            "text": "The immortal DF-1 cell line was established spontaneously from Line 0 endogenous-virus negative embryos and had been widely used for the propagation of various avian viruses (Bacon et al., 2000) . A genome-wide transcription profile of DF-1 cells and a comparison of their global gene expression with that of primary CEF revealed that DF-1 cells are characterized by enhanced molecular mechanisms for cell cycle progression and proliferation, suppressing cell death pathways, downregulation of caspase 3, altered cellular morphogenesis, and accelerated capacity for molecule transport (Kong et al., 2011) . The observation that reduced caspase activity of DF1 cells is accompanied by diminished muNS processing when ARV infects these cells raised the interesting possibility that caspase activation and muNS cleavage are interlinked events. This hypothesis is reinforced by our finding that muNS is not processed when expressed in baculovirus-infected cells (Fig. 1A) , probably because baculoviruses express antiapoptotic factors that prevent caspase activation (Clem, 2007; Clem et al., 1991) , although this awaits experimental confirmation. To explore whether there was a connection between caspase activity and muNS processing we first investigated the effect that two broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors, Z-VAD-FMK and Q-VD-OPh, exert on these processes when added to ARV-infected cells at the onset of infection. The effect of these inhibitors on the apoptotic state of infected cells was monitored by two different approaches. In the first one, we used immunofluorescence analysis of histone H2AX phosphorylation to determine the percentage of cells containing damaged DNA (Cook et al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2010) . For this, the cells were fixed, stained with a monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated H2AX and counterstained with DAPI. Polyclonal antiserum against the nonstructural muNS protein was also used to visualize ARV-infected cells ( Fig. 2A) . Quantification of the stained cells revealed that, similar to staurosporine treatment (lane 5), ARV infection caused a 10 fold increase in the percentage of cells containing phosphorylated H2AX (compare lanes 1 and 4). However, this increase was highly attenuated when the infected cells were incubated in the presence of either of the two caspase inhibitors (lanes 2 and 3). In the second approach, we used the luminiscent Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay kit (Promega) for measuring caspase-3/7 activities. The cells were lysed in Caspase-Glo 3/7 substrate and protease activity was measured as relative light units (RLU). The results shown at the bottom of Fig. 2B indicate that infection of CEF cells with ARV induces a 10 fold increase in caspase activity, but this increase is significantly reduced when the infected cells are incubated in the presence of either of the two pancaspase inhibitors.",

Both immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation analyses of extracts from ARV-infected CEF revealed that muNSto-muNSC conversion was dramatically reduced when the cells were incubated in the presence of either of the two inhibitors ( Fig. 2C , compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). In subsequent experiments we exclusively used the inhibitor Q-VD-OPh because it blocks apoptosis at very low nontoxic concentrations, and also because it inhibits caspase activity, but not cathepsin activity (Caserta et al., 2003; Ku\u017eelov\u00e1 et al., 2011) . The results shown in Fig. 2D reveal that the ability of Q-VD-OPh to inhibit both apoptosis and muNS processing in ARV-infected CEF is dosedependent, and further show that the load of muNSC is drastically reduced at a Q-VD-OPh concentration as low as 5 \u03bcM. A time course of muNS processing and caspase activation performed in ARV-infected cells in the presence or absence of Q-VD-OPh ( Fig. 2E ) revealed that even though the presence of muNS was first detected at 3 hpi, muNSC was not detected until 6 hpi, coinciding with a large increase in caspase 3/7 activity. Furthermore, both muNS processing and an increase in caspase activity were not observed when Q-VD-OPh was present during the infection (Fig. 2E , \u00fe Q). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that there is a correlation between ARV-induced apoptosis and muNS processing.",

We first observed that the capacity of extracts of ARVinfected cells to cleave in-vitro-synthesized muNS was largely abolished when the infected cells were incubated in the presence of Q-VD-OPh (Fig. 3A , compare lanes 1 and 2). In addition, the reduced ability of ARV to induce muNS processing in DF-1 cells was significantly enhanced when the cells were incubated during the last 6 h of infection with the pro-apoptotic agents actinomycin D and staurosporine (Fig. 3B , compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 4), but the ability of these compounds to enhance muNS processing was blocked in the presence of the apoptotic inhibitor Q-VD-OPh ( Fig. 3B , lanes 3 and 5). Finally, these pro-apoptotic agents were also effective in promoting muNS processing in transfected cells (Fig. 3C ). Our findings that caspase inhibitors prevent muNS processing in ARV-infected cells and that apoptosis enhancers promote muNS cleavage in both transfected cells and ARV-infected DF1 cells indicate that muNS cleavage is catalyzed by an effector caspase activated during ARV infection.",

Plasmids expressing these truncations (lanes 3-5) and full-length muNS (lane 2) were transfected into CEF and the transfected cells, as well as ARVinfected CEF (lane 1), were incubated with [ 35 S]amino acids at 24 h after transfection or 16 hpi. The cells were lysed with RIPA buffer, the extracts were immunoprecipitated with muNS-specific antiserum and the resulting samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The results reveal that muNSC migrates slightly faster than the muNS truncation 140-635, suggesting that the cleavage site should be located several residues downstream of Met-140 (Fig. 4A) . A similar conclusion has been recently reached when comparing the electrophoretic mobility of muNSC with that of in-vitro-translated muNS truncations (Busch et al., 2011) . A survey of the deduced amino acid sequence downstream of Met-140 for an appropriate caspase cleavage motif revealed the presence of the sequence 151 DSPD\u2193A 155 (Fig. 4B, underlined) , which is a canonical cleavage motif for caspases 3 and 7 (DXXD\u2193Y; \"X\" indicates any amino acid; \"Y\" indicates G, A, T, S or N) (Thornberry et al., 1997; Timmer and Salvesen, 2007) . To verify that this putative caspase recognition sequence is a bona fide cleavage site we first examined whether the electrophoretic mobility of muNS, muNSC and muNSN matched with that of transiently expressed polypeptides comprising muNS residues 1-635, The resulting extracts were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-muNS serum and the imunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on an electrophoresis gel system (8% tricine-SDS-PAGE gel) specifically designed to resolve small peptides (Sch\u00e4gger, 2006) . The results reveal that the muNS, muNSC and muNSN proteins present in ARV-infected cells (Fig. 4C , lane 1) have the same electrophoretic mobility as that of the muNSderived recombinant polypeptides comprising residues 1-635, 155-635 and 1-154, respectively (Fig. 4C, lanes 3-5) . It should be however noted that partial conversion of muNS to muNSC took place in transfected CEF cells when the cell monolayers were kept in serum-free medium for more than 5 h during lipofection (Fig. 4C, lane 3) . This is probably due to the fact that apoptosis is induced when the cells are incubated for long periods of time in serum-free medium (not shown).",

To rule out the possibility that a function of the protein other than proteolysis could be modified by the mutation, we examined the capacity of the D154A mutant to form inclusions and to recruit the viral proteins lambdaA and sigmaNS to these structures. The immunofluorescent images shown in Fig. 4D reveal that the single site mutant D154A maintains the ability of wild-type muNS to form inclusions (lane 1) and to recruit the two ARV proteins to these structures (compare top and bottom rows of lanes 2 and 3). These observations suggest that the D-to-A mutation does not significantly alter the spatial conformation and activity of the nonstructural viral protein. We next compared the capacity of staurosporine to promote processing of both wild-type muNS and its D154A mutant in transfected cells. The results revealed that staurosporine promoted the cleavage of wild-type muNS, but not of the mutant D154A, in transfected cells (Fig. 4E) . Similarly, extracts of ARV-infected CEF promoted the cleavage of wild-type muNS, but not of the D154A mutant (Fig. 4F ). Taken together, these observations indicate that ARV muNS is cleaved by caspases between muNS residues Asp-154 and Ala-155.",

Our observation that muNS cleavage takes place in ARV-infected cells of both avian and mammalian origin indicates that muNS is a substrate for avian and mammalian caspases. To assess the role of caspase 3 in muNS processing we compared muNS-to muNSC conversion in ARV-infected HeLa and MCF-7 human cells. HeLa is a caspase 3-competent cell line, whereas MCF-7 is a breast cancer cell line that does not express a functional caspase 3 due to a 125 bp deletion in exon 3 of the caspase 3 gene (J\u00e4nicke, 2009) . The results of the immunoblot analysis shown in Fig. 5A reveal that muNS-to-muNSC conversion takes place in ARV-infected HeLa cells (lane 2) and that this conversion is prevented by the pancaspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh (lane 3). However, muNS-to-muNSC conversion did not occur in ARV-infected MCF-7 cells (lane 5), even when these cells were treated for the last 6 h of infection with pro-apoptotic staurosporine (lane 6). This result suggests that caspase 3 or a protease activated by caspase 3 is directly involved in the cleavage of muNS.",

For this we compared the capacity of Triton-X-100-containing buffer (TX) to extract muNS and muNSC from ARV-infected cells. This buffer has been previously used to discriminate between soluble and cytoskeleton-associated mammalian reovirus proteins, as well as soluble and inclusionassociated ARV proteins (Mora et al., 1987; Touris-Otero et al., 2004a) . In the first approach, mock-infected (Fig. 6C, lanes 1 and 3) and ARV-infected CEF (Fig. 6C, lanes 2 and 4) were lysed with the Triton-X-100-containing buffer and the extracts resolved into TX-soluble (lanes 1 and 2) and TX-insoluble (lanes 3 and 4) fractions. The resulting samples were subjected to Western blot analysis with muNS-specific antiserum. The results revealed that while similar amounts of muNS were present in the TX-soluble and -insoluble fractions, most muNSC was extracted by the TX buffer. In the second approach, ARV-infected cells were pulsed with [ 35 S]amino acids for 10 min, then chased in nonradioactive medium for different time periods, and finally fractionated into TX-soluble and -insoluble fractions. The samples were immunoprecipitated with muNS-specific antiserum and analyzed by 8% tricine-SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 6D) . The results revealed that newly-synthesized muNS and sigmaNS distributed between the two fractions, with a slightly higher proportion in the TX-insoluble fraction. In contrast, most muNSC and almost all muNSN were extracted by the TX buffer at all chasing times. The reliability of the extracting procedure was evidenced by the finding that the structural protein lambdaA coimmunoprecipitated with muNS exclusively in the TX-insoluble fraction at all chasing times (lanes 6-8). These findings indicate that muNS, sigmaNS and lambdaA associate with ARV factories more tightly than muNSC, despite that muNSC, but not lambdaA or sigmaNS, collects into inclusions when expressed individually in transfected cells.",

The Western blot shown in Fig. 7A reveals that although the presence of the inhibitor from the onset of the infection completely blocks muNS processing, it does not significantly alter the intracellular concentration of the ARV nonstructural protein sigmaNS. This result indicates that apoptosis and muNS processing do not have significant effects on ARV gene expression and on stages of the virus life cycle prior to gene expression. Furthermore, the inhibitor did not significantly change the production of infective ARV particles, as determined by a virus plaque assay (Fig. 7B, total virus) , indicating that both apoptosis and muNS processing are not required for the production of infective progeny in cultured cells.",

When triggered early in infection apoptosis may limit both the time and the cellular machinery available for virus replication. Therefore, it is not surprising that many viruses try to overcome the apoptotic threat by using a battery of different strategies and by expressing a variety of antiapoptotic products aimed to block or delay the induction of apoptosis (Galluzzi et al., 2010) . However, other viruses induce apoptosis actively at late stage of infection to facilitate virus release and spread with limited induction of inflamatory and immune host responses (Teodoro and Branton, 1997) . The results shown in Fig. 2E confirm previous findings from our laboratory that ARV infection triggers apoptosis in cultured cells at an early stage of the viral life cycle (Labrada et al., 2002) , yet the results of this study demonstrate that early apoptosis triggering does not have adverse effects on either ARV gene expression or infectious progeny production. These apparently conflicting results can be reconciled considering that ARV has a short replication time (Benavente and Martinez-Costas, 2006) , which would allow the virus to proceed its life cycle successfully until completion and to reach a satisfactory intracellular production of progeny viral particles before the infected cell dies or is severely damaged by the execution of apoptosis.",

            "text": "A growing number of viruses have been documented to take advantage of apoptosis induction and caspase activation to promote their own replication. For instance, viruses as diverse as mammalian reovirus, human astrovirus, measles virus, porcine circovirus 2, African swine fever virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, coronavirus, influenza virus and the Moscow strain of Ectromelia virus, all have been reported to usurp apoptosis for facilitating the release of progeny viral particles from infected cells (Best, 2008; Galluzzi et al., 2010) . The results of the present study suggest that ARV should be included in that list, since this virus activates rather than suppress caspases and this activation is necessary for efficient virus release and spread. On the other hand, many apoptosisinducing viruses express proteins that are processed by caspases to generate cleavage products with novel properties, ranging from apoptosis downregulation to enhancement or attenuation of viral replication (Richard and Tulasne, 2012) . Still, the functional consequences of many protein caspase cleavages remain elusive so far, yet the conservation of caspase targets in many viral proteins and the stability of their processed products suggest that caspase cleavage of viral polypeptides can constitute an evolutionary advantage that benefits virus replication. In this study we have provided compelling evidence that caspases activated during ARVinduced apoptosis catalyze the cleavage of ARV nonstructural muNS protein to produce the 17-kDa N-terminal peptide muNSN and the 55-kDa C-terminal protein muNSC. In the literature to date, there are several examples of other non-structural viral proteins that are caspase targets, like the NS1 protein of Aleutian mink disease parvovirus, the NS5A protein of hepatitis C virus, the NS1 0 protein of Japanese encephalitis virus, and the EIA protein of adenovirus 12 (Best et al., 2003; Grand et al., 2002; Satoh et al., 2000; Sun et al., 2012) . We also observed that a substantial amount of full-length muNS remains uncleaved both in infected cells and after 6 h of incubation with recombinant caspase 3, implying that caspase-catalyzed muNS cleavage is a regulated process, as has been reported for several cellular and viral proteins (Best et al., 2003; Chaudhry et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2010; Mashima et al., 1999; Sun et al., 2012) . Incomplete processing of a precursor viral protein could be a strategy to reduce the activity of the intact protein or it could be used to increase the protein repertoire encoded by size-limited viral genomes, thus generating cleaved viral products with novel properties/activities.",

It should be noted however that avian and mammalian reovirus muNSC proteins display different properties. Thus, while mammalian reovirus muNSC still maintains its precursor's ability to associate with the major core protein lambda1 (Miller et al., 2010) , this ability is not shared by its ARV counterpart (Fig. 6B) , because sequences of ARV muNS required for binding to lambdaA are lacking in muNSC. It has been reported that the release of astrovirus from infected cells depends on both the processing of the capsid precursor polypeptide VP90 and the activities of executioner caspases (Banos-Lara and Mendez, 2010) . Accordingly, the possibility exists that muNS processing is required for enhanced release and dissemination of ARV, although it is unlikely, since apoptosis has also been reported to promote the release of mammalian reovirus from infected cells without enhancing the production of its muNSC protein (Marcato et al., 2007) . In the absence of an established reverse genetics system for avian reoviruses, the consequences of muNS cleavage on viral replication and spread remain unclear.",

This observation suggests that ARV factories are complex structures formed by a diverse array of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and that these entities are much more complex than muNS-derived inclusions. This is supported by our observation that the inclusions formed by expressing muNS versions in baculovirus-infected insect cells can be easily purified (Brandariz-Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2010a) , whereas we are unable to purify the factories formed in ARVinfected cells.",

            "text": "The results shown in Fig. 5 demonstrate that muNS is a substrate for mammalian caspase 3, yet the absence of both commercial recombinant caspases of avian origin and caspase 3-deficient avian cells does not allow us to identify the avian caspase that catalyzes ARV muNS cleavage in infected avian cells. Nevertheless, this cleavage is probably catalyzed by an avian caspase 3-like protease, since caspase sequences and targets are highly conserved in different species (Sakamaki and Satou, 2009) , and since we found both that caspase 3/7 is active in ARV-infected avian cells and that muNS-to-muNSC processing is promoted by the caspase 3 activator staurosporine (Chae et al., 2000) . The presence of a caspase 3/7 consensus sequence ( 151 DSPD\u2193A 155 ) within the muNS cleavage region allowed us to map the muNS cleavage site between residues Asp-154 and Ala-155, by using sitedirected mutagenesis. This finding suggests that this region of muNS is placed in a flexible and exposed loop accessible to caspases. Interestingly, the caspase 3/7 consensus sequence found in ARV S1133 muNS is not fully conserved among avian reoviruses isolated from chickens, since it is only present in 8 isolates, and in one quail isolate, but not in other 9 chicken isolates. Thus, in the muNS protein from 4 chicken isolates Asp-151 is replaced by His, while in the protein from another 5 isolates Asp-151 and Ser-152 are replaced by His and Glu, respectively (Fig. 8 ). If cleavage of these \"nonconsensus\" ARV muNS proteins still occurs between Asp-154 and Ala-155, it would imply that accessibility is more important than the presence of specific amino acids at positions 3 and 4 of the caspase consensus sequence, which is in agreement with previous reports indicating that caspases do not have a strict requirement for positions 2-4 of the consensus cleavage site (Timmer and Salvesen, 2007; Thornberry et al., 1997) . Curiously, the muNS protein encoded by both duck and goose reoviruses does not contain a caspase 3/7 consensus sequence spanning residues 151-155, because Asp-154 is replaced by a Gly residue. However, these muNS proteins contain two putative caspase targets, one spanning residues 142-146 ( 142 GTMDA 146 ), and the other comprising residues [156] [157] [158] [159] [160] . Surprisingly, the former caspase target is also present in the muNS protein from four chicken isolates (Fig. 8) . It should be of interest to check whether duck/goose reoviruses induce apoptosis, whether the muNS protein of these viruses is cleaved in infected cells and whether its cleavage takes place at one or both of these caspase consensus sequences. Nevertheless, the presence of specific residues in the muNS 140-177 region could serve to assign a poultry reovirus as an avian/quail or a goose/duck reovirus. Thus, the muNS from reoviruses of avian/quail origin has leucine in position 144, alanine or valine in 150, aspartic acid in 154, cysteine in 156 and valine in 159, whereas the muNS from reoviruses of duck/ goose origin has methionine, glycine, glycine and aspartic acid in those positions.",

Mock-infected cells either untreated (lane 4) or incubated for 6 h in the presence of 0.5 \u03bcM staurosporine (lane 5) are used as control samples. The cells are analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against muNS (upper row; green), with a monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated H2AX (middle row; red), and nuclei are stained with DAPI (lower row; blue). The percentage of red-stained nuclei shown at the bottom of the figure is the mean of three independent experiments, and 100 cells were counted for each experiment. (B) Effect of the same concentrations of the two apoptotic inhibitors on caspase 3/7 activity. Caspase activity is determined with the Caspase-Glo s 3/7 Assay kit (Promega), as described in Methods section, and expressed as arbitrary RLU units. Each value is the mean of three independent experiments. (C) Effect of the two apoptotic inhibitors on muNS processing in ARV-infected CEF. Processing is monitored by both immunoprecipitation (IP; upper panel) and Western blotting (WB; lower panel) using muNS-specific antiserum. The sample in lane 1 is run on the same gel, but an internal lane is removed. (D) Effect of Q-VD-OPh on muNS processing and caspase 3/7 activity. ARV-infected CEF monolayers are incubated from the onset of the infection with the concentrations of the pancaspase inhibitor shown on top. At 16 hpi the cells are lysed and the resulting extracts are assayed for caspase 3/7 activity and muNS processing. Processing of muNS is monitored by Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies against muNS and actin. The values of caspase activity shown at the bottom of the figure are the mean of three independent experiments. (E) Time course of muNS processing and caspase 3/7 activity in ARVinfected CEF cells. CEF cell monolayers are infected with 10 PFU/cell of ARV, either in the absence (top blot) or presence (bottom blot) of 10 \u03bcM Q-VD-OPh.
