Two partial spike gene fragments S1 (322-1464 bp) and S2 (2170-2814 bp) of SARS coronavirus were amplified by RT-PCR, and cloned into pET-23a prokaryotic expression vector, then transformed into competent Escherichia E.coli BL21 (DE3)(pLysS) respectively. Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified by Ni 2+ immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The purified proteins mixed with complete Freund adjuvant were injected into Balb/c mice three times at a two-week interval. High titer antibody was detected in the serum of immunized Balb/c mice, and mice immunized with S1 protein produced high titer IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3, while those immunized with S2 protein produced high titer IgG1, IgG2a, but lower titer IgG2b and IgG3. Serum IFN-\u03b3 concentration was increased significantly but the concentrations of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 had no significant change. And a marked increase was observed in the number of spleen CD8+ T cells. The results showed that recombinant proteins of SARS coronavirus spike protein induced hormonal and cellular immune response in Balb/c mice.",

Purified S1 and S2 recombinant proteins were recognized by the sera of SARS patients by Western blotting, indicating that recombinant S1 and S2 proteins retained its antigenicity. The immune responses to antigen include the generation of specific antibodies and cellular immune response. The mice immunized with S1 and S2 proteins produced specific IgG. The titers reached the maximum at the sixth week after three vaccinations and the maximum titer remained for 14 weeks. Both Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes can help B lymphocyte produce specific antibody. In mice Th1 lymphocytes secrete Th1 type cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 to induce the specific cellular immunization and to promote the production of IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3, while Th2 lymphocytes secrete Th2 type cytokines such as IL-4, -5, -6, -10 to promote the production of IgG1. Recombinant S1 protein elicited high titers of IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b and S2 protein elicited high titers of IgG1 and IgG2a in mice. The results showed that S1 and S2 proteins elicited both Th1 and Th2 type immune responses. The sera cytokine analysis showed that only IL-2 concentration was increased as compared with PBS group, but no significant difference was found as compared with CFA group, implying the recombinant protein has no influence on the sera Th1 and Th2 type cytokines secretion. In this study, we only detected the cytokines in sera 7 weeks after the first immunization. The noticeably elevated percentage of CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets indicated that the recombinant protein elicited the definite cellular immune responses, but the mechanism needed further study.",
