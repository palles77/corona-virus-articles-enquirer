Singapore was one of the earliest areas to be affected, with the index case admitted to a local hospital on 1 March 2003 [1] . Since then, there have been more than 7700 cases worldwide and 205 cases in Singapore, both as of 16 May 2003 [2] . One of the factors which contributes to the large number of cases is that the disease is easily transmissible via droplet infection from close contact. This situation is seen in the household setting, where family members are at risk of contracting the disease from an infected person. The number of children infected appears to be relatively small. We report a cluster of four children affected with SARS in this way, with emphasis on the contact history and radiological features.",

Chee Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in a paediatric cluster in Singapore Abstract Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a major infectious disease pandemic that occurred in early 2003, and one of the diagnostic criteria is the presence of chest radiographic findings. Objective: To describe the radiographic features of SARS in a cluster of affected children. Materials and methods: The chest radiographs of four related children ranging in age from 18 months to 9 years diagnosed as having SARS were reviewed for the presence of air-space shadowing, air bronchograms, peribronchial thickening, interstitial disease, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, hilar lymphadenopathy and mediastinal widening. Results: Ill-defined air-space shadowing was the common finding in all the children. The distribution was unifocal or multifocal. No other findings were seen on the radiographs. None of the children developed radiographic findings consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome. All four children showed significant resolution of the radiographic findings 4-6 days after the initial radiograph. Conclusions: Early recognition of these features is important in implementing isolation and containment measures to prevent the spread of infection. SARS in children appears to manifest as a milder form of the disease as compared to adults.",

In view of the large number of ill family members with symptoms, there was a high index of suspicion for SARS. As such, the children and other affected family members were admitted for further assessment and investigation. Their 18-month-old cousin, patient D, was admitted 2 days later with a 5-day history of fever and dry cough.",

She presented initially with severe headache followed by a high fever and cough. She then rapidly deteriorated, collapsed suddenly, and passed away at home within 3 days of falling ill. She had been healthy prior to this episode of illness and had no past medical history of note. The postmortem examination performed did not find a cause for her sudden demise, but no investigations for SARS were done at the time in view of the lack of travel history and the apparent lack of contact history. This was later done and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for coronavirus was positive. The link in the contact history only emerged later, when it was discovered that the grandfather of the children worked in a local wholesale vegetable market where there had been a recent community outbreak of SARS. He subsequently also passed away from a SARS-related cause.",

The radiograph at presentation showed a single rounded area of ill-defined air-space consolidation in the lateral aspect of the left lower zone (Fig. 1a) . The size and appearance of the consolidation was essentially unchanged on the second radiograph 2 days later, and partial resolution was seen on the third radiograph taken 4 days after the first (Fig. 1b) . The last radiograph on the day of discharge showed almost complete resolution (Fig. 1c) . In all four patients, no other areas of consolidation developed apart from that already present in the initial radiograph. No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces were noted throughout the course of the disease. Bilateral involvement was seen in patient A (Fig. 2) , and unilateral multifocal consolidation in patient C (Fig. 3) . Patient D had a single area of consolidation in the left upper zone (Fig. 4) .

However, these PCR tests need to be further validated, as there appears to be poor sensitivity with high false-negative results. Also, when community outbreaks occur, a contact source may not always be found immediately. As such, a high index of suspicion is needed in the assessment and evaluation of SARS patients.

            "text": "In summary, young children appear to show a much milder response to SARS as compared to older children and adults. This is seen in both the clinical and radiographic features, where none of our patients went into respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation or intensive care, and the changes on the chest radiographs did not worsen after initial presentation. The difference is interesting, and could possibly be related to a difference in immune response in the different age groups. Further studies with a larger pool of patients are warranted, and this may assist in further identifying the behaviour of the implicated coronavirus.",
