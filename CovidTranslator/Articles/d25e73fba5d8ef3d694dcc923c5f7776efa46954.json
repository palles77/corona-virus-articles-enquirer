            "text": "Since the World Health Assembly endorsed a plan to completely eradicate polio in 1988, the large-scale use of the attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) has drastically decreased the number of polio cases. However, the OPV vaccine brings rare but serious adverse consequences, especially in the Type 2 vaccine strains. Most vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) outbreaks are associated with Type 2 polio vaccine strains, and approximately 26-31% of genetically divergent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) cases are associated with the Type 2 component of OPV. [1, 2] Other than VAPP cases and VDPVs, Type 2 polio vaccine strains can also cause a variety of illnesses. [3] To the best of our knowledge, no cases of pneumonia resulting from Type 2 polio vaccine strains have been reported. However, here we report an infant case associated with the Type 2 polio vaccine strain.",

An antibiotic was given by intravenous drip for 3 days in a local hospital in Anhui Province, but a low-grade fever and cough persisted until his hospitalization in Beijing Haidian Hospital. Blood tests in the Haidian Hospital revealed the following results: the total white blood cell count was 1.165 \u00d7 10 10 /L (normal range: 1.500 \u00d7 10 10 /L-2.000 \u00d7 10 10 /L); N: 14.8%; the total platelet count was 7 \u00d7 10 11 /L; and hemoglobin was 110 g/L. The laboratory tests showed that the C-reactive protein was 5.0 mg/L (normal range \u226410.0 mg/L). Chest radiographs showed thickness or turbulence in the texture in both lungs and blotches of shadows in the right lung. Further clinical features were respiratory sounds and pulmonary rales. In the hospital, treatments included antibiotic therapy and respiratory management such as aerosols, suctioning, back therapy, and body positioning. He was given intravenous tazobactam sodium 1 g/d and ambroxol hydrochloride and Ge injections 15 mg/d. After 3 days of treatment, his body temperature returned to normal and his cough was mild. He was released on August 8 after his cough and pulmonary rales disappeared and after the chest films revealed significant absorption of the infected lesions. Except for the presence of the pneumonia symptoms, he had no problems with his growth and development.",

Subsequently, a Type 2 polio vaccine strain was identified with cycle threshold values of 25 using the enterovirus molecular serotyping method and the poliovirus intratypic differentiation method. [4] To further characterize this virus strain, the entire VP1 region was determined directly from the nasopharyngeal swab with the method provided by National Polio Laboratory of China. The VP1 sequences were compared with the sequences available in the GenBank database using the basic local alignment search tool. The results showed that the sequence had 100% nucleotide similarity compared with that of the parental Sabin Type 2 strains. Meanwhile, the poliovirus nucleic acid was identified in the patient's nasopharyngeal swab sample using an Ion Torrent PGM deep sequencing instrument for a viral metagenome analysis. Several other viruses were identified in this sample, including the fowl adenovirus C, the Streptococcus phage, the human endogenous retrovirus, and the choristoneura occidentalis granulovirus, but none were associated with this pneumonia. The virus was also isolated from the patient's nasopharyngeal swab sample using rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) (human RD cell) and L20B (murine cell lines expressing the human poliovirus receptor) cell lines provided by National Laboratory for poliomyelitis in China CDC.",

To the best of our knowledge, the relationship between the polio vaccine strain and pneumonia has not been previously reported. The polio vaccine strain can propagate and excrete in the upper respiratory system within several days after the OPV administration. In this case, it was unclear whether the polio vaccine strain was a provoking factor or only a contributing factor to the pneumonia onset and development. The clinical and virologic investigation revealed that respiratory illnesses were diagnosed in many patients but only the Sabin poliovirus could be detected in their respiratory tracts, suggesting that ingested OPVs spread and cause diseases beyond the gastrointestinal tract. [3] The poliovirus caused outbreaks of human acute respiratory diseases or \"minor illnesses\" without clinical symptoms of the involvement of the central nervous system. A search of the database revealed that OPVs spread through the nasopharynx which is detected by serum neutralization from patients with acute respiratory infections. [5] Notably, an epidemiological investigation found that an infant had similar respiratory clinical symptoms after each dose of tOPV. Thus, these reports, along with the case in this study, support the causal relationship between the Type 2 polio vaccine and pneumonia.",
