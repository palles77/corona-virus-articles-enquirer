The resulting number, however, does not represent the true case fatality rate and might be off by orders of magnitude [30] . The true case fatality rate is unknown at this stage of the outbreak, and its precise estimate is impossible at present [30, 31] . Globally, the clinical picture in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 have ranged from mild (no or few signs and symptoms), to severe, including death. It was reported that the first instance of COVID-19 related pneumonia cases, whether linked to the Huanan Seafood market or not, occurred between 6 and 15 December 2019 [33] . Another study reported the onset of pneumonia cases related to COVID-19 occurred between the 1 st and 10 th of December [8] .

            "text": "Regarding SARS-CoV-2 in particular, there are several aspects that needs a One Health approach in order to understand the outbreak, and to mitigate further outbreaks of a similar virus. SARS-CoV-2 is likely a bat-origin coronavirus that was transmitted to humans through a spill over from bats or through an undetermined yet intermediate animal host (avian, swine, phocine, bovine, canine, other species) or wild animals. Figure 3 depicts a transmission hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, yet the intermediate host is to be determined. The list of animals which were sold range between poultry (turkey, pheasants, geese, roosters, doves, and wild birds (Peacocks swans, and exotic animals, to reptiles and hedgehogs. The animal list included frogs, camels, wild rabbits, reptiles, snakes, deer, crocodiles, Kangaroos, snails, civet cats, goats, centipedes, and cicades [45, 46] . There are no data available in scientific literature on the detection and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from environmental samples. However, it was recently reported that the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention isolated SARS-CoV-2 from 33 samples out of 585 environmental samples collected from Huanan Seafood Market [47] . process, and they need to be addressed in any true One Health approach [48] . However, it is crucial to consider the cultural context of these markets meaning that again, social sciences are important in this process. Also, this means that the most viable solution may not be to close down live animal markets but perhaps to 'sector' them so that fewer different species mingle in one specific market and that the specific intermediate host(s) for SARS-CoV-2 may be removed from the markets, or rigorously tested for the virus.",

As a previous example, in 2018, an HKU-2 bat origin, swine acute diarrhoea (SADS-coronavirus emerged in swine population in Guangdong in China [27]. Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman hosts including swine and wild animals and further genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2, SADS-CoV, and other SARS-like CoVs may reveal the possible intermediate host of the recently emerged human SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the current outbreak and is a very important One Health measure. When the transmission chains and ecology of SARS-CoV-2 are clearer, the next step is to identify potential interventions to mitigate transmission. The unavailability of information on the possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 and leaving the intermediate host undetermined are of high risk to humans and may result in inevitable infections with SARS-CoV-2 and future epidemics. In addition, exploring the intermediate host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 will help conduct further investigations to evaluate the host-pathogen relationship, disease dynamics and the possibility of reverse zoonosis. These interventions will likely include measures of several different types including several different disciplines [42, 43, 48]. Hypothesizing that bats will be proven as SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs and that adaptation to humans took place in an intermediate host in a live animal market, the following measures would be important: i) Decreasing the risk of transmission from the natural host. This includes more knowledge of the natural ecology of the virus, so that high-risk transmission situations can be avoided. Also, it is important to consider transmission risks when new interfaces between bats and humans are created, e.g. when human habitations extend into bat habitats. Finally, there are important social science/behavioural measures conveying the message to the public which interactions with bats should be avoided (based on disease ecology knowledge). the risk of transmission from the intermediate host. In principle, this risk could be avoided by completely separating bats from the intermediate host. Depending on which animal(s) is proven to constitute the intermediate hosts(s) for SARS-CoV-2, this may however be more or less difficult in practice. Likely, live animal markets play an important role in this",

The implementation of One Health measures in live animal markets in China (where SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to have emerged), will likely reduce the risk of emerging zoonotic viruses of pandemic potential in the future. These measures may include implementation of legislations but collaborative interdisciplinary control measures between agricultural and public health sectors are also crucial. Such measures include biosurveillance of live animal markets, improved biosecurity in livestock farms, live animal markets and during animal transportation, public education on zoonotic diseases, and the importance of adopting a cooperative approach between agencies.The success in the containment of the current COVID-19 outbreak in China and the sporadic travel related cases worldwide will depend much on conventional public health measures, rapid clinical case identification, contact investigation, strict infection control in healthcare facilities, patient isolation, public education and community containment (quarantine)[53].",
