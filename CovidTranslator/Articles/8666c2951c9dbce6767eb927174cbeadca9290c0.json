To evaluate the molecular mechanisms behind this event, we investigated the roles of SARS-CoV proteins in regulation of the proinflammatory factor, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Individual viral proteins were tested for their abilities to regulate COX-2 gene expression. Results showed that the COX-2 promoter was activated by the nucleocapsid (N) protein in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blot analysis indicated that N protein was sufficient to stimulate the production of COX-2 protein in mammalian cells. COX-2 promoter mutations suggested that activation of COX-2 transcription depended on two regulatory elements, a nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) binding site, and a CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) binding site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) demonstrated that SARS-CoV N protein bound directly to these regulatory sequences. Protein mutation analysis revealed that a Lys-rich motif of N protein acted as a nuclear localization signal and was essential for the activation of COX-2. In addition, a Leu-rich motif was found to be required for the N protein function. A sequence of 68 residuals was identified as a potential DNA-binding domain essential for activating COX-2 expression. We propose that SARS-CoV N protein causes inflammation of the lungs by activating COX-2 gene expression by binding directly to the promoter resulting in inflammation through multiple COX-2 signaling cascades.",

            "text": "In March 2003, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the causative agent of SARS (Ksiazek et al., 2003) . The virus has been demonstrated to induce fever, edema, and diffuse alveolar damage in severely affected individuals (Poutanen et al., 2003) . Similar to other coronaviruses in structure, SARS-CoV is an enveloped virus containing a single-stranded, positivesense RNA genome, 29.7 kb nucleotides in length, that encodes four viral structural proteins including the spike (S) glycoprotein, the matrix (M) protein, the small envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein (Marra et al., 2003) . The gene encoding for the 46-kDa SARS-CoV N protein directly precedes the 3 -UTR of the viral genome (Rota et al., 2003) . For coronaviruses, the N protein plays an important role during viral packaging, viral core formation, and viral RNA synthesis (Narayanan, Chen, Maeda, & Makino, 2003) . The SARS-CoV N protein shares homology with N protein from other members of the coronavirus family. However, it contains a short lysine-rich sequence (362-KTFPPTEPKKDKKKKTDEAQ-381) near the carboxyl terminus, a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal that has not been found in the N proteins of any other known coronavirus (Marra et al., 2003) . This suggested that the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein might have novel functions in pathogenesis. The SARS-CoV N protein has been reported to form a dimmer by selfassociation (He et al., 2004) , to activate the activator protein 1 (AP1) signal transduction pathway (He et al., 2003) , and to induce actin reorganization in COS-1 cells (Sutjit et al., 2004) .",

The amplified genes and their corresponding primers are listed in Table 1 . The PCR products were purified using a DNA extraction kit (Fermentas), digested with EcoRI and SalI or BamHI and EcoRI (underlined sequence in primers), and cloned into the vector pCMV-Tag2 (Stratagene). Sitespecific mutations of the N gene were performed by using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Four site-specific mutations of the N gene were as follows: MutN1 ( 38PKQRRPQ44); MutN2 ( 220LALLLLDRLNQL231); MutN3 ( 257-KKPRQKR263); MutN4 ( 369KKDKKKK376). The deleted regions of MutN3 and MutN4 comprised lysine/arginine-rich motifs. The mutations and their corresponding primers are listed in Table 2 . Forward primers (N1-N5) for sequential truncations of the N gene from the 5 end are listed in Table 3 , and the reverse primer is Nd (Table 1) . Reverse primers (N6-N9) for sequential truncations of the N gene from the 3 end are listed in Table 3 , and the forward primer was Nu (Table 1) .

Sequential N-terminal deletion mutants of the SARS-CoV N protein were generated by deleting nucleotides from the 5 end of the N protein gene and inserting the truncated gene into vector pCMV-Tag2 (Fig. 5A) . The function of each mutant N gene was evaluated by luciferase assay following transfection of 293T cells with a reporter plasmid carrying the luciferase gene driven by the COX-2 promoter. Results from luciferase activity assays (Fig. 5B) showed that deletion of amino acids from 1 to 61 (N 1), 1 to 136 (N 2), or 1 to 204 (N 3) from the N terminal of the protein, respectively, had no effects on its function in terms of COX-2 gene activation, whereas deletions of amino acids from 1 to 269 (N 4) significantly decreased the level of reporter gene expression. Further deletion from 1 to 333 (N 5) entirely abolished luciferase activity.

To determine the correlations between viral infection and lung inflammation, we isolated a SARS-CoV from a SARS patient previously (Zhu et al., 2005) .

This study revealed that N protein specifically recognized the NF-B and C/EBP regulatory elements on the COX-2 promoter. In addition, the region from amino acids 204 to 269 at N terminal of the protein appeared to be essential for the activation of COX-2 expression. Based on our results and previously reported findings, it is reasonable for us to suggest that N protein activates COX-2 gene expression by binding either directly or indirectly to NF-B and C/EBP regulatory elements on COX-2 promoter. Results from electrophoresis mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that SARS-CoV N protein activated COX-2 gene expression by binding directly to C/EBP and NF-B regulatory elements on the promoter. It is most likely that amino acids from 136 to 204 of N protein were involved in the protein-DNA or protein-protein binding. This was also in agreement with the finding that through multi-alignment of total nineteen sequences of the coronavirus N proteins including that of SARS-CoV, one conserved structural region at amino acids 81-140 was found to perform critical functions (Wang et al., 2003) .",

Deletion of the Lys-rich region (257-KKPRQKR-263) in N protein resulted in the loss of function in the activation of COX-2.

To our surprise, deletions of this domain in N protein had minimal effects on the activation of COX-2 expression relative to full-length N protein. There are at least two explanations for these results. One is that there are two nuclear localization signal sequences in the N protein and the first one 257-KKPRQKR-263 at the N terminal is essential and efficient to transmit the protein into nucleus as demonstrated in this study. The second explanation is that the short lysine-rich sequence (362-KTFPPTEPKKDKKKKTDEAQ-381) and adjacent sequences at the C terminal of the N protein are in fact involved in different functions, such as protein dimerization, rather than nuclear localization.",
