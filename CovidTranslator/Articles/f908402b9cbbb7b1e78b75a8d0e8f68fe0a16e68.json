The industry is currently experiencing strong growth rates, but is also confronted with major challenges in an increasingly complex and dynamic environment. Intensifying globalisation, stronger competition, higher customer demands and resource scarcity are just a few of the factors that lead to a more turbulent and uncertain environment. Given the potential negative impact of these factors, an analysis of future requirements is required to foster innovations in logistics in order to maintain competitiveness and the ability to adapt to changes (Halld\u00f3 rsson and Kov\u00e1 cs, 2010, p. 5; Flint et al., 2005, pp. 113-114; Soosay and Hyland, 2004, p. 41; . Scenario planning has been identified as one of the most appropriate approaches for long-range planning and to support decisions in uncertain situations (Courtney et al., 1997, p. 78; Schoemaker, 2002, pp. 47, 48; Phelps et al., 2001, p. 223-224; Powell, 1992, p. 551) . The positive impact of its adoption has been proven empirically. In a broader sense, 30 or more studies have examined a positive relationship between long-range planning and corporate performance over the past four decades (see e.g. Ansoff et al., 1970; Miller and Cardinal, 1994; Rhyne, 1986) .",

Porter's ''Five Forces Model'' (Porter, 1979 ) (related to research question 2). These projections include aspects such as the global energy consumption, resource scarcity, labour shortage, the role of emerging and developing countries, urbanisation, demographic change, social responsibility, global warming, digitisation, global networks, and large-scale outsourcing. The experts which participated in the Delphi study assessed each of these projections in terms of the probability of occurrence, the potential impact on the industry and their desirability. Based on these assessments and numerous verbal specifications and comments from the participants, different scenarios were developed. Probable scenarios for the future of the logistics services industry in 2025 were developed based on 12 projections with high probabilities of occurrence and consensus among experts; these included, for example, projections about the diminishing economic gap between emerging markets and developing countries and the still unresolved energy supply problem to foster globalisation. Furthermore, we examined surprising or unexpected scenarios, so-called discontinuities, with a low probability of occurrence but with a high impact on the industry; these include, ''fabbing'', terrorist attacks, and the spread of pandemics.",

As in the course of cost reduction and flexibility improvement, the vertical integration will further be reduced. On the other hand, the regional scope of production is still expanding. Therefore, information and goods flows have to be synchronised on a global level, leading to high complexity in the system.

Many scenarios actually include forecasts through trend extrapolations of historical data. A few publications exhibit a qualitative focus, i.e. scenarios based on a narrative description of the future (see e.g. Institute for Mobility Research (ifmo), 2002 Research (ifmo), , 2005 . This may be due to the fact that most of the scenario studies were intended to serve as a basis for decision makers in public policy. Especially in logistics, scenario planning often focuses on macro-environmental aspects, such as infrastructure, roadwork, transportation markets, and policies (see e.g. Piecyk and McKinnon, 2009; European Community, 2004; Stead and Banister, 2003) . In the PROTRANS project, funded by the European Commission, scenarios were developed with a focus on intermodality in the European logistics services industry. Two models for the focused field of intermodal transportation were developed, which were considered in a best, average and worst case simulation (Protrans, 2003) . Hardly any studies exist which consider industry scenarios to support decision making in companies (see e.g. Bergman et al., 2006) . Furthermore, many studies follow a classical, functional understanding of logistics, i.e. transportation, handling, warehousing (see e.g. Duin et al., 2005; English and Keran, 1976; European Community, 2004) , and scenario research so far has not focused on the logistics services industry taking a holistic, supply chain perspective into consideration.",

The Delphi method attempts to systematically develop expert opinion consensus about future developments and events which are formulated as projections, i.e. short and concise future theses. It is a judgmental forecasting procedure in the form of an anonymous, written, multi-stage survey process, where feedback of group opinion is provided after each round (Delbecq et al., 1986, p. 83; Linstone and Turoff, 1975, p. 3; Rowe and Wright, 2001, p. 126) . The Delphi process we employed is based on the classical procedure from RAND Corporation, which is the most approved and accepted variant of the Delphi approaches (Dalkey, 1967 (Dalkey, , 1969 Chermack et al., 2001, p. 10) .

This approach guaranteed that research fatigue was kept as low as possible, which, in turn, assured a higher response rate and validity of the data (Mitchell, 1991, p. 347 ). In addition, numerous researchers have revealed that the major opinion of the study changes over time and, therefore, the most reliable study value occurs after the first iteration (see e.g. Rowe et al., 1991, p. 237; Woudenberg, 1991, p. 140) . We recognised that this approach may not lead to consensus for all projections. Finally, the answers were analysed and used for scenario development. The latter included desk research, scenario writing, discontinuity analysis and an expert check for plausibility and consistency.",

Purposive sampling was performed, based on databases of members of the World Future Society and Association of Professional Futurists, to find the sample of 54 futurists. The selection criteria were: technical specialisation in logistics-related fields of global issues; methodological specialisation in scenario planning; quantity and quality of publications; academic title; education; profession; and position in science or practice. These futurists identified 89 influencing factors in order to prepare the projections on the future of logistics. (4) In a similar fashion, 20 experts from specialist trend and futures consultancies were interviewed. Based on market research, organisations were identified, which offer scenario consultancy services in Germany. The sample of 24 organisations was used as a census. The experts within the organisations were selected based on the following criteria: long scenario planning experience and specialisation within the logistics field, if available in the organisation. In total, 134 factors were identified and analysed. (5) Secondary data was reviewed through desk research, of which 134 influencing factors could be determined. (6) Finally, the database of a futures consultancy provided 59 factors. Pretesting to ensure reliability as well as content and face validity were performed at two stages in the Delphi process.

Second, we ensured the avoidance of conditional statements by making the primary question dependent on the fulfilment of a series of conditions or by urging experts to evaluate the two parts of the projection in the same manner, even if they had a different opinion on each statement.

An analysis of the expectational probabilities revealed a decrease in the standard deviations (SD) of all projections that had been evaluated in both rounds. In line with the fundamental rational of the Delphi method, the feedback of the statistical group response and the experts' comments led to a convergence among the expert panel's opinions, implying that the participants more strongly agreed on their estimations. The strongest convergence was measured for projection 20 (paperless transport). Its standard deviation decreased by 27.9%. Projection 26 (agent systems), in turn, recorded the weakest change at 4.5%.

The projection was selected because there was no consensus within the expert panel but probability and impact were rather high. The wildcard ''fabbing'' (projection 29) was chosen because experts did agree in their evaluation, but allocated a low probability and a medium impact on the industry. The third wildcard ''spread of a pandemic through logistics networks'' was an outcome of the experts' arguments within several projections. The remaining five wildcards were identified in a similar way: return of protectionism; dictatorship of data protection (e.g. prohibition of exchange, storage, and internal use of any type of individual-related data); worldwide system failure (information and communication system breakdowns); the rise of revolutionary transportation technologies; fully automated, selfmonitoring logistics.

Deutsche Post World Net, in turn, reports of detailed emergency plans in agreement with health and regulatory agencies.

Third, we included analyses of discontinuities and surprising occurrences in our scenarios research to give further insights on possible changes in the macro-environment and industry structure for the logistics services industry. In fact, scenario planning might be of more relevance for logistics service providers in the future due to the turbulent business environment, which is highly susceptible to discontinuities. Our discontinuity analysis came up with new, inspiring, and surprising issues although it was limited in its scope. The wildcard scenarios on fabbing, terrorism attacks, and pandemics illustrated that such analyses help to sensitise companies for events and developments which are very improbable, but might have fundamental impact on the business if they do happen.",

For organisations already investing in environmental scanning, the Delphi data can provide a validation or expansion of their own scans. A scenario transfer, i.e. the usage of the scenarios for decision support, may be either active or passive. While the former concerns the update or development of new strategies, the latter refers to testing existing strategies regarding their robustness. The wildcards are particularly suitable for developing contingency plans for the future.
