However, the role of sensory neurons in pulmonary host defense is unclear. Here, we found that TRPV1 + nociceptors suppressed protective immunity against lethal Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. Targeted TRPV1 + -neuron ablation increased survival, cytokine induction, and lung bacterial clearance. Nociceptors suppressed the recruitment and surveillance of neutrophils, and altered lung gd T cell numbers, which are necessary for immunity. Vagal ganglia TRPV1 + afferents mediated immunosuppression through release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Targeting neuroimmunological signaling may be an effective approach to treat lung infections and bacterial pneumonia.",

A highly coordinated immune response protects the respiratory tract from pathogens and other external insults. The role of the nervous system in regulating pulmonary host defense is not well defined. Pulmonary infections and lethal pneumonia are major public-health problems frequently causing death in children and immunocompromised and elderly people 1 . S. aureus is a Gram-positive human bacterial pathogen that is the leading cause of hospital-acquired infections, particularly respiratory-tract infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia [1] [2] [3] [4] . The increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains necessitates nonantibiotic approaches to treatment. Targeting neuroimmunological signaling may be a novel approach to boost host immunity against lung pathogens.",

In contrast, the proportion of NF-200 + neurons, which include A fibers, was higher in the DT-treated Trpv1-Dtr mice.

Whereas most vehicle-treated mice succumbed to pneumonia (80% mortality), most RTX-treated mice survived (Fig. 1e) . RTX-treated mice, compared with vehicle-treated mice, showed improved maintenance of core body temperature (Fig. 1e) and less lung bacterial burden (Fig. 1f) .

Because nociceptors may regulate the peripheral resistance of the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems to infection, we measured vital signs. However, the oxygen saturation, heart rate, perfusion, and respiratory rates did not differ between RTXtreated and vehicle-treated mice at steady state; the respiratory rates also did not differ postinfection (Supplementary Fig. 6 ).",

We investigated whether nociceptor ablation affected lung-barrier permeability.

RTXtreated mice, compared with vehicle-treated mice, showed greater immune-cell influx in the lungs at 12 h and 24 h postinfection, as determined by H&E staining (Fig. 2a) . We hypothesized that early increases in immune cells might correlate with improved bacterial clearance in RTX-treated mice. Brown and Brenn staining showed many Gram-positive bacterial colonies in vehicle-treated lungs at 12 h and 24 h postinfection (Fig. 2b) . In contrast, RTX-treated mice showed few bacterial colonies (Fig. 2b) . We next determined whether nociceptors regulated proinflammatory-cytokine production. At an early time point of infection (6 h), RTX-treated mice showed higher induction of total inflammatory-protein levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (Fig. 2c) , as well as levels of the cytokine TNF-\u03b1 and the chemokine CXCL-1 (Fig. 2d) . By 12 h postinfection, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and CXCL-1 levels were lower in RTXtreated mice (Fig. 2d) , as were levels of the cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and MCP-1 (Supplementary Fig. 15 ). These data indicated that TRPV1 + neuron ablation leads to faster induction and resolution of cytokine levels during infection. TRPV1 neurons suppress recruitment of neutrophils We next used FACS analysis to analyze the kinetics of immunecell influx into inflamed lungs during S. aureus infection. RTXtreated mice, compared with vehicle-treated mice, displayed greater CD11b + Ly6G + lung neutrophil recruitment at 6 h and 12 h postinfection (Fig. 3a,b) . Trpv1-Dtr-neuron-ablated mice showed greater neutrophil recruitment than did PBS-treated controls at 12 h postinfection (Fig. 3c) . Because neutrophils are critical for bacterial clearance 23 , we hypothesized that neuronal modulation of neutrophil recruitment might play a major role in MRSA pneumonia. We depleted neutrophils in RTX-treated mice by using low-dose anti-GR1 antibody treatment, which, compared with control IgG treatment, eliminated CD11b + Ly6G + neutrophils in infected lungs (Fig. 3d) . Anti-GR1 also decreased CD11b + Ly6C hi monocytes but did not affect CD11b + Ly6C lo monocytes (Supplementary Fig. 16 ). Neutrophil depletion in RTX-treated mice significantly increased their susceptibility to MRSA pneumonia: whereas 100% of anti-GR1-treated RTX mice succumbed to infection, 0% of the control IgG-treated RTX mice died from infection (Fig. 3e) . These experimental results were confirmed in an independent cohort of mice ( Supplementary  Fig. 17 ). Neutrophils were also required for baseline protection against MRSA pneumonia (Fig. 3e) . These data suggested that RTXmediated enhancement of lung immunity requires neutrophils.",

Using intravital microscopy, we analyzed the subpleural vascular bed to assess whether neutrophil kinetics and patrolling of tissues were regulated by nociceptors. Compared with control mice, RTX-treated mice recruited significantly more neutrophils to pulmonary capillaries during early S. aureus pneumonia (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Video 1). We observed less GFP-S. aureus in the lungs of nociceptor-depleted animals, in agreement with previous CFU data. Dynamic neutrophil behavioral phenotypes were analyzed for tethering, crawling, and firm adhesion within the vasculature. Tethering is a rapid, transient neutrophil interaction with the vessel wall, which requires limited cellular activation. Adhesion indicates a more advanced state of activation mediated by integrins before tissue emigration. Crawling is a complex intravascular behavior that requires upregulation of \u03b22-integrin, which occurs rapidly during lung host defense 24, 25 . Neutrophils behaved differently during host defense in control versus RTX-treated mice. In RTX-treated , vehicle + anti-GR1 mice (n = 10), RTX + rat IgG mice (n = 9), and RTX + anti-GR1 mice (n = 10). Statistical analysis by log-rank test, P < 0.0001 (RTX + rat IgG versus RTX + anti-GR1), P < 0.0001 (vehicle + rat IgG versus vehicle + anti-GR1), and P = 0.002 (vehicle + rat IgG versus RTX + rat IgG). Right, core body temperature, measured after S. aureus infection with or without neutrophil depletion. Vehicle + rat IgG (n = 5); vehicle + anti-GR1 (n = 5); RTX + rat IgG (n = 4); RTX + anti-GR1 (n = 5). Statistical analysis by two-way RM ANOVA with Bonferroni post tests (P = 0.008, RTX + rat IgG versus RTX + anti-GR1). Data from two independent experiments (b,e) or one experiment with multiple biological replicates (c) are shown. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. in b, c (neutrophil proportions), and e (core body temperature). mice, a significant proportion of neutrophils demonstrated vascular crawling (Fig. 4c) , and tracking individual pulmonary vascular neutrophils revealed significantly greater crawling distances (Fig. 4d,e) , a phenotype consistent with cellular activation and host defense against bacterial pathogens. Therefore, live imaging supports the contention that enhanced neutrophil function in the absence of nociceptors aids in the eradication of bacterial pneumonia.",

Analysis of a second transcriptional data set 26 showed that Trpv1 was absent in immune cells but was highly expressed in DRG (Supplementary Fig. 18 ).

Whereas Trpv1 was highly expressed in the VG and DRG, it was undetectable in all lung immune cells analyzed (Supplementary Figs. 19 and 20) .

Further subset analysis revealed that this increase was specific to V\u03b31 + cells and V\u03b31 \u2212 V\u03b32 \u2212 cells, but not V\u03b32 + cells ( Fig. 5c and Supplementary Figs. 24 and 25). We found a similar increase in \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in Nav1.8-Cre +/\u2212 ; Dta mice compared with control littermates (Supplementary Fig. 24 ). \u03b3\u03b4 T cells reside within epithelial layers of the lungs, skin, and gut, where they act as first responders to infection 27 . We next used \u03b3\u03b4 T cell-deficient Tcrd \u2212/\u2212 mice to investigate the role of these cells in neuroimmunological suppression. Wild-type (WT) or Tcrd \u2212/\u2212 mice were treated with RTX to ablate TRPV1 + neurons, and then S. aureus pneumonia was induced (Fig. 5d,e) . The absence of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was confirmed in Tcrd \u2212/\u2212 mice through flow cytometry (Fig. 5d) . Tcrd deficiency led to a loss of protection against MRSA infection and abrogated the survival enhancement due to RTX treatment (Fig. 5e ). This reversal of protective immunity correlated with an imbalance in core body temperature (Fig. 5e ) and greater bacterial burdens in BALF isolated from RTX-treated Tcrd \u2212/\u2212 mice compared with RTX-treated WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 26 ). Tcrd \u2212/\u2212 also showed defective baseline immunity against MRSA pneumonia (Fig. 5e) . Whereas IL-6 levels were unaffected by Tcrd deficiency, levels of IL17A, a cytokine mediating protection against MRSA 28 , were significantly lower in Tcrd \u2212/\u2212 mice (Supplementary Fig. 26 ). Neutrophil recruitment did not differ in the lungs of RTX-treated Tcrd \u2212/\u2212 mice and RTX-treated WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 26) , thus suggesting that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and neutrophils are separately regulated.",

All mice from the PBS-injected group died within 72 h after infection, whereas a 90% survival rate was observed among mice lacking vagal TRPV1 neurons (Fig. 6b) .

The nociceptive neuropeptide CGRP inhibits TNF-\u03b1 production in macrophages and suppresses lymph node hypertrophy in skin bacterial infection 29, 30 . We hypothesized that CGRP might mediate neuroimmunological signaling during lethal bacterial pneumonia. We found that CGRP levels significantly increased in the BALF after S. aureus infection (Fig. 6c) . Infection with an S. aureus strain mutant for agr, a key bicomponent quorum-sensing regulator of virulence-factor expression 31 , did not induce CGRP release into the BALF (Fig. 6c) . S. aureus also directly induced cultured neuronal release of CGRP in vitro, in a manner dependent on agr (Supplementary Fig. 30 ). TRPV1 + cells mediated CGRP release in the lungs, because CGRP levels were significantly lower in the BALF in RTX-treated and vagal DT-treated Trpv1-Dtr mice than in control-infected mice at 12 h postinfection (Fig. 6d) . CGRP levels were also significantly lower in the BALF at steady state in nociceptor-depleted mice than in control nondepleted mice (Supplementary Fig. 31) . We next asked whether CGRP might play a role in MRSA pneumonia. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that lung \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and neutrophils expressed Ramp1 and Calcrl, which encode the cognate CGRP receptor (Supplementary Fig. 32) . We found that CGRP treatment inhibited lung-cell production of TNF-\u03b1 and CXCL1, but not IL-6, in response to MRSA infection (Fig. 6e) . Increasing concentrations of CGRP also inhibited intracellular killing of S. aureus by mouse neutrophils (Supplementary Fig. 33) . To explore the involvement of CGRP in host defense, we treated mice with the competitive CGRP peptide antagonist CGRP 8-37 at time points before and after S. aureus lung infection (Fig. 6f) . This treatment, compared with vehicle treatment, improved survival and core-body-temperature maintenance (Fig. 6f) . We next found that CGRP 8-37 administered at time points after S. aureus infection also significantly improved survival and core-body-temperature maintenance (Fig. 6g) . These data showed that nociceptors mediate CGRP release during lung infections and that postinfection blockade of CGRP signaling may aid in treatment of bacterial pneumonia.",

It is potentially advantageous that interactions between these cell types coordinate host responses to pathogen invasion. We found that TRPV1 + afferents in the VG played a critical role in modulating innate immune responses against MRSA lethal pneumonia. Targeting these neurons through Trpv1-Dtr-mediated ablation (or RTX treatment) improved survival, neutrophil and \u03b3\u03b4 T cell responses, and bacterial clearance. Nav1.8-cre; Dta mice, in which an overlapping though distinct nociceptor subset is targeted, showed a milder protective phenotype. Both strategies paradoxically resulted in increased bacterial dissemination. These data suggested that differences in phenotypes (lung clearance versus barrier function) are mediated by distinct neuronal subsets. A recent study has shown that Trpv1 expression in the adult DRG is mainly restricted to CGRP + and substance P (SP) + C fibers 14 . In contrast, Nav1.8 has been found to be expressed in myelinated A fibers as well as C fibers 32 . Another study has shown that Nav1.8-Cre; Dta mice still possess CGRP + neurons expressing TRPV1 (ref. 21) . Therefore, future experiments using more refined genetic tools should help to distinguish the functional contributions of individual TRPV1 + and/or Nav1.8 + neuronal subsets in pulmonary immunity and barrier function.",

Distinct vagal afferents control physiological functions including breathing and nutrient sensation 6, 39 . It would be interesting to ascertain how neuronal subsets differentially cross-talk with immune cells. Immune cells may utilize nerves as tracts for migration, as has been observed for dendritic-cell interactions with Nav1.8 + nociceptors in the skin 20 . Lung-resident immune cells may be proximal to vagal nerve afferents and may consequently able to set up local neuroimmunological responses. Recently, the neuropeptide NMU has been found to drive ILC2-mediated inflammation in the gut and lungs [40] [41] [42] . We found that nociceptors released the neuropeptide CGRP into the airways during infection and downregulated immunity. CGRP has previously been linked to vasodilation and vascular permeability 43 . CGRP suppresses CXCL1, an important chemokine for lung-neutrophil chemoattraction 44 . Furthermore, CGRP antagonism improves survival outcomes in MRSA-infected mice and is therefore a potential target for clinical application in pneumonia.",

For MRSA-induced pneumonia, lethality is mainly mediated by damage to the lungs by secreted exotoxins (Hla and PVL) rather than bacterial dissemination 3,52 .

Neurons were plated on laminin-coated 96-well culture dishes in NB medium containing B27, 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Life Technologies), and penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies). The medium was changed every other day. At day 7, DRG neurons were stimulated with S. aureus or 500 nM capsaicin (Sigma) for 30 min, and supernatant was collected. CGRP levels in the culture supernatant, BALF, or lung homogenates were determined with a CGRP EIA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman Chemical).",
