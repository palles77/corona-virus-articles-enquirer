The NS1 protein from all strains of influenza A virus binds TRIM25, although not all virus strains block the interferon response, suggesting alternative mechanisms for TRIM25 action. Here we present a nuclear role for TRIM25 in specifically restricting influenza A virus replication. TRIM25 inhibits viral RNA synthesis through a direct mechanism that is independent of its ubiquitin ligase activity and the interferon pathway. This activity can be inhibited by the viral NS1 protein. TRIM25 inhibition of viral RNA synthesis results from its binding to viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs), the structures containing individual viral RNA segments, the viral polymerase, and multiple viral nucleoproteins. TRIM25 binding does not inhibit initiation of capped-RNA-primed viral mRNA synthesis by the viral polymerase. Rather, the onset of RNA chain elongation is inhibited because TRIM25 prohibits the movement of RNA into the polymerase complex.",

            "text": "Influenza A viruses cause an annual, highly contagious respiratory disease in humans and are responsible for pandemics that result in high mortality rates (Wright et al., 2013) . The influ-enza A virus genome is comprised of eight segments of negative-sense viral RNA. The smallest segment encodes the NS1 protein, a multifunctional nonstructural protein that antagonizes host antiviral responses and regulates other virus-host interactions (Krug and Garcia-Sastre, 2013) . One function of the NS1 protein is to bind the TRIM25 E3 ligase, inhibiting its multimerization and thus its ligase activity, an action that was postulated to block activation of the RIG-I pathway (Gack et al., 2009) . However, not all human-circulating influenza A virus strains block RIG-I-mediated activation of IRF3 and interferon-b transcription (Kuo et al., 2010 (Kuo et al., , 2016 , although the NS1 proteins of all tested strains bind TRIM25 (Gack et al., 2009; Kuo et al., 2010; Rajsbaum et al., 2012) . Notably, strong activation of IRF3 and interferon-b transcription still occurs in cells that are infected with viruses expressing NS1 proteins of human-circulating H3N2 and H2N2 viruses (Kuo et al., 2010 (Kuo et al., , 2016 . Consequently, binding of TRIM25 by the NS1 protein does not directly correlate to the suppression of interferon-b induction in cells infected with the influenza A virus. These results led us to propose that the NS1 protein is antagonizing a different, unknown function of TRIM25.",

            "text": "In the present study, we identify this previously unknown TRIM25 function inhibited by the NS1 protein. We demonstrate that TRIM25 directly restricts influenza viral RNA synthesis in infected cells. Like restriction enzymes in bacteria, mammalian restriction factors block virus replication directly, without the need for extensive cellular signaling (Blanco-Melo et al., 2012) . The restriction activity of TRIM25 is independent of both the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM25 and the interferon induction pathway. In fact, TRIM25 restriction of influenza viruses is so direct that it can be reconstituted with purified components in vitro. We show that inhibition of viral RNA synthesis results from TRIM25 binding to double-helical influenza viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs), the complexes that contain individual viral RNAs, the viral RNA polymerase, and multiple viral nucleoproteins (NP) that coat the viral RNA (Arranz et al., 2012; Resa-Infante et al., 2011; te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016; Ye et al., 2006) . We show that TRIM25 binds to vRNPs in in vitro assays and also in the nucleus of virus-infected cells, where viral RNA synthesis takes place (Herz et al., 1981) . Glycerol gradient analysis and electron microscopy (EM) revealed that TRIM25 binds along the length of the vRNPs in an RNA-dependent manner, with no apparent preferential binding site. In vitro transcription assays indicated that TRIM25 binding onto vRNPs does not inhibit initiation of capped-RNA-primed viral mRNA synthesis by the vRNP-associated polymerase. Rather, TRIM25 inhibits the onset of RNA chain elongation, most likely because TRIM25 acts as a molecular clamp on the vRNP-associated template RNA. In this model, TRIM25 simultaneously binds both RNA and protein components of the vRNP, locking the RNA in place and blocking its movement into the viral polymerase.",

For this reason, we took two alternative approaches to obviate NS1 antagonism so that we could study the activity of TRIM25 that NS1 is suppressing. In our first approach, we overexpressed TRIM25 to a level exceeding the amount of the NS1 protein produced in infected cells. To overexpress TRIM25, we used retroviral vectors to generate transgenic cell lines stably expressing either FLAGtagged human TRIM25 or FLAG-tagged TRIM25 from three different nonhuman primate species (agile gibbon, orangutan, or talapoin). The latter represent versions of TRIM25 to which human influenza A viruses have not been exposed. These nonhuman primate TRIM25 proteins were found to be especially potent against human influenza A virus, and one of them (gibbon TRIM25) proved to be crucial for determining the mechanism of TRIM25 action against influenza virus. We found that, of all the cell backgrounds that we tested, only CRFK cells support stable, high-level expression of these FLAG-TRIM25 proteins (Figure 1A) -higher than the level of endogenous human TRIM25 expressed in human cells ( Figure S1A ). CRFK cells transduced with the empty vector, or with a vector expressing the HIV-1 restriction factor TRIM5a (Stremlau et al., 2004) , were created as negative controls. Comparable amounts of human and nonhuman primate TRIM25 proteins were stably produced by the CRFK cell lines. The expressed TRIM25 is a doublet: the upper band is autoubiquitinated TRIM25 (Inn et al., 2011) , as demonstrated below.",

In cells expressing human TRIM25, viral protein synthesis was reduced in Udorn-infected cells by 35% compared to the negative controls. The reduction in viral protein levels was much greater in cells expressing any of the nonhuman primate TRIM25 molecules. For example, viral protein levels in cells expressing gibbon TRIM25 were reduced by 90% in Udorn-infected cells. This is despite the fact that human and gibbon TRIM25 differ in sequence at only 21 out of 630 amino acid positions ( Figure S2 ). Similar results were obtained using the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A/California/09 virus (Figure S1B ).

We tested both wild-type (WT) NS1 and the R38A/K41A mutant NS1 protein, the latter of which does not bind TRIM25 (Gack et al., 2009) . WT NS1 protein led to a 14-fold increase in influenza A virus protein production in the CRFK cells expressing human TRIM25, whereas this level of the mutant NS1 protein led to only a 2-fold increase in viral protein production in these cells. These results indicate that the NS1 protein antagonizes the antiviral activity of the excess TRIM25 molecules produced in CRFK cells.",

At 7 hr after infection (0.2 pfu per cell), we used quantitative RT-PCR to measure the levels of mRNAs and viral RNAs (vRNAs) encoded by three viral genes: NP, NS1, and HA (hemagglutinin; Figure 1E ). The levels of these virus-specific RNAs were lower in CRFK cells expressing either human or gibbon TRIM25 compared to the cells transduced with the empty plasmid. Gibbon TRIM25 inhibited virus-specific RNA synthesis more effectively than human TRIM25. For example, viral mRNA levels were reduced by 50-60% in CRFK cells expressing human TRIM25 and by 90% in CRFK cells expressing gibbon TRIM25. We conclude that TRIM25 inhibits influenza viral replication in infected cells, at the step of viral RNA synthesis or at some step upstream of RNA synthesis. We also conclude that gibbon TRIM25 is a more potent inhibitor of viral replication than human TRIM25. Because human and gibbon TRIM25 have similar binding affinities for the NS1 protein ( Figure S3 ), it is unlikely that the greater inhibition observed with gibbon TRIM25 is due to differential inhibition by the NS1 protein, as verified by the minigenome assays described below.",

Accordingly, we deleted the TRIM25 gene of human A549 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 ( Figure S4 ). To ensure that the effect of the deletion of TRIM25 does not simply manifest through failed activation of the interferon response via the RIG-I pathway, we also deleted the RIG-I gene in the background of both the control and TRIM25 deletion lines. Thus, WT A549 cells, RIG-I knockout A549 cells, and double (TRIM25 and RIG-I)-knockout A549 cells were each infected with 0.002 pfu per cell of Udorn virus, and virus replication was monitored by determining the levels of viral proteins at 24 hr post-infection using immunoblots (Figure 2A ). The level of viral protein production in the cells in which both TRIM25 and RIG-I were knocked out (lane 3) was 2-to 3-fold higher than the level in the cells in which only RIG-I was knocked out (lane 2), demonstrating that endogenous TRIM25 inhibits viral protein production independently of the RIG-I pathway. To ensure that the effect we observed was TRIM25-specific, we stably complemented the RIG-I/TRIM25 double-knockout A549 cell line with either FLAG-tagged versions of human or gibbon TRIM25 or with an empty vector as a control ( Figure 2B ). It is important to note that stable overexpression of FLAG-TRIM25 was tolerated in the RIG-I/TRIM25 double-knockout A549 cells, whereas it was not in WT A549 cells. In the presence of human TRIM25, influenza protein production is reduced to levels observed in the WT A549 cells ( Figure 2B ). The cell line expressing gibbon TRIM25 shows an even greater reduction in viral protein production, in line with the experiments carried out in the CRFK cell line. These complementation experiments show that the effect we observe in the A549 knockout cells is TRIM25 specific.",

A cell extract collected from mock infected cells was immunoblotted using rabbit anti-NS1 antibody as a reference for the amount of NS1 present at the time of infection.

            "text": "To confirm that TRIM25 lacking ligase activity inhibits viral RNA synthesis, we carried out minigenome assays to measure viral RNA synthesis. Influenza virus RNA synthesis takes place in the context of vRNPs. Each influenza vRNP is comprised of one of the RNA genome segments; the viral polymerase complex comprised of the PA, PB1, and PB2 proteins; and multiple NP proteins that coat the RNA genome segment (Arranz et al., 2012; Resa-Infante et al., 2011; te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016; Ye et al., 2006) . In the minigenome assay, cells are transfected with plasmids that express all the protein components of the vRNP and a plasmid that expresses in the negative sense a Firefly luciferase reporter gene flanked by the 5 0 and 3 0 terminal regions of an influenza vRNA. This reporter gene is expressed only in the context of an active influenza polymerase complex. A plasmid expressing the Renilla luciferase is cotransfected along with the other plasmids to control for transfection Figure 1E .

See also Figure S4 . efficiencies, so that the Firefly:Renilla luciferase ratio measures viral RNA synthesis. To determine the effect of TRIM25 on viral RNA synthesis, we cotransfected, along with these other plasmids, increasing amounts of a plasmid expressing the ligase-deficient human or gibbon TRIM25 protein. To totally eliminate the RIG-I pathway in this analysis, we engineered 293T cells via CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt RIG-I (Figures S5C and S5D). As shown in Figure 3B , human and gibbon TRIM25 both inhibit influenza RNA synthesis in this assay, which, it should be noted, is conducted in the absence of both NS1 and RIG-I. These results show that neither the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM25 nor interferon signaling is required for the TRIM25-mediated inhibition of influenza A virus RNA synthesis observed here.",

While TRIM25 is predominately found in the cytoplasm, two recent studies found that a significant amount of TRIM25 is located in the nucleus (Choudhury et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015) . To assess the validity of these recent studies, we fractionated A549 cells into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions using our recently developed procedure (Zhao et al., 2016) . This procedure yields a cytoplasmic fraction that contained the cytoplasmic b-actin protein and lacked the nuclear Mre11 protein and a nuclear fraction that contained Mre11 but lacked b-actin ( Figure 4B ). TRIM25 was found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of WT-and RIG-I-knockout A549 cells. We quantitated relative amounts of cytoplasmic and nuclear TRIM25 by measuring band intensities and taking into account volumes of lysis buffer used for the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts. The amount of TRIM25 in the nucleus is approximately 5% of the amount in the cytoplasm in WT A549 cells and approximately 8% of the amount in RIG-I knockout A549 cells. We do not detect any difference in TRIM25 localization resulting from Udorn virus infection (Figure 4B) . To verify the cell fractionation results, we carried out live imaging experiments. For this purpose, we generated RIG-I/TRIM25 double-knockout A549 cells that stably express GFP-tagged human or gibbon TRIM25. Live imaging of these cells showed that TRIM25 foci are present in most nuclei (Movies S1 and S2). ",

Because TRIM25 is responsible for the inhibition of viral RNA synthesis and virus replication in RIG-I knockout A549 cells ( Figures 2C and 2D ), we conclude that endogenous TRIM25 causes these inhibitions by binding to nuclear vRNPs, the vRNPs that catalyze viral RNA synthesis in infected cells (Herz et al., 1981) .

Glycerol gradient analysis of this mixture was compared to that of a duplicate TRIM25-vRNP mixture that was not treated with RNase A. Because viral RNA is on the outside surface of influenza vRNPs (Ye et al., 2006) , it is susceptible to RNase digestion (Duesberg, 1969; Ye et al., 2006) . After RNase digestion, the resulting nucleoprotein complexes have lower molecular weights than the vRNPs that were not RNAse-treated ( Figure 5A) ; nonetheless, these nucleoprotein complexes do not fall apart, as previously shown by others (Duesberg, 1969; Ye et al., 2006) . TRIM25 did not bind to these RNA-free oligomeric nucleoprotein complexes, demonstrating that TRIM25 binding of vRNPs is dependent on the presence of viral RNA in the vRNPs. Variable amounts of free TRIM25 were observed at the top of the gradients. We also confirmed the RNase dependence of TRIM25 binding to vRNPs in the context of minigenome conditions. 293T RIG-I knockout cells were transfected as described in Figure 3 and nuclear extracts were used to immunoprecipitate FLAG-tagged TRIM25 ( Figure 5B ). NP immunoprecipitated with both human and gibbon TRIM25, whereas NP was not detected when nuclear extracts were treated with RNase ( Figure 5B ). It is not surprising that TRIM25 binding of influenza vRNPs is RNAdependent, because previous results have established that TRIM25 has RNA-binding activity (Choudhury et al., 2014; Kwon et al., 2013; Manokaran et al., 2015) . In fact, TRIM25 binds both influenza virion RNA (vRNA) and its complementary RNA (cRNA), and we did not detect a difference in the binding of influenza vRNA or cRNA between gibbon and human TRIM25 proteins ( Figure S7B ).",

The resulting complexes were visualized by EM ( Figure 5C ). The vRNPs were seen to be in their native double-helical conformation. Both human and gibbon TRIM25 molecules (detected by nanogold particles) bound to the vRNPs, although there was a small amount of nonspecific binding with the His-SUMO control. TRIM25 binding was observed at various different locations on the vRNPs, and a preferential TRIM25 binding site on the vRNPs was not observed. Gibbon TRIM25 bound significantly more vRNPs than did human TRIM25 (Figures 5C and 5D ). In addition, a substantial number of individual vRNPs contained multiple gibbon TRIM25 molecules, whereas only a few individual vRNPs contained multiple human TRIM25 molecules. These results show that gibbon TRIM25 has a higher affinity than human TRIM25 for binding influenza vRNPs.

Gibbon TRIM25 was approximately 4-fold more effective than human TRIM25 in inhibiting viral mRNA synthesis, reflecting the difference in the binding of the two TRIM25 molecules to vRNPs.

            "text": "Accordingly, we focused on the effect of TRIM25 on the initiation of viral mRNA synthesis. The first step in capped-RNA-primed viral mRNA synthesis is the cleavage of a capped RNA by the polymerase-associated endonuclease to generate capped RNA fragments of 12-14 nucleotides in length that serve as primers . This reaction requires the participation of the PA endonuclease domain and the PB2 cap-binding domain of the viral polymerase (Dias et al., 2009; Guilligay et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2009 ). If TRIM25 interacts directly with the tripartite polymerase of the vRNPs, it is likely that this endonuclease activity would be inhibited. To assay endonuclease activity, a 42-nucleotide-long capped RNA containing 32 P only in its cap structure was incubated with the vRNPs in the absence of ribonucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) ( Figure 6B, lanes 1-3) . Neither gibbon (Gi) TRIM25 nor human (Hu) TRIM25 inhibited endonuclease activity, as seen by the equal accumulation of the 14-nucleotide RNA primer generated in all three lanes. In the presence of the four NTPs and the absence of TRIM25, the generated capped primers were used to produce full-length viral mRNAs, which migrate together in a diffuse band near the top of the 10% gel used in this analysis ( Figure 6B, lane 7) . Both human and gibbon TRIM25 inhibited the synthesis of full-length viral mRNAs from these capped primers, and gibbon TRIM25 was a more potent inhibitor ( Figure 6B , lanes 5-7, light exposure; lanes 8-10, dark exposure). The 10% gel enabled us to discover whether any RNA transcripts smaller than the smallest full-length viral mRNA were produced. We did not detect any such short transcripts even with very dark exposures of the gels, confirming the results in Figure 6A that TRIM25 does not cause premature termination of elongating RNA chains. Hence, it is likely that the minimal amount of full-length mRNAs produced in the presence of TRIM25 results from vRNPs that lack bound TRIM25. In addition, we found that the 14-nucleotide-long capped primers decreased to the same extent in the absence or presence of TRIM25. As discussed below, these results are compatible with the mechanism of viral mRNA synthesis elucidated by recent structural studies Reich et al., 2014; te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016) .",

We show that the NS1 protein blocks TRIM25 The relative sizes of NP (grey balls), TRIM25 (aqua), and the viral polymerase (brown) correspond to their relative molecular weights. The three protein subunits of the polymerase (PB1, PB2, and PA) make multiple interactions with each other, but these interactions are not shown in this model. Instead, the main body of the polymerase is represented as a brown ''donut,'' and entry and exit sites used during viral mRNA synthesis are depicted. The ''donut hole'' contains the catalytic site for nucleotide addition. The PB2 cap-binding site and PA endonuclease are located at one end of the main body of the polymerase, as depicted by the red and purple balls in this model. The capped-RNA-cleavage and initiation steps are identical in the absence and presence of TRIM25. In contrast, the onset of RNA chain elongation is blocked in the presence of TRIM25, as discussed in the text. In the lower left panel, a small arrow indicates that NP has to be displaced in order for the RNA chain to enter the polymerase and be copied.

Because inhibition of viral RNA synthesis by TRIM25 occurred in the absence of functional RIG-I in both infected cells and minigenome assays, we were able to reconstitute this inhibition in vitro with purified components, definitively divorcing this restriction activity from activation of the host interferon response. Viral RNA replication is also catalyzed by viral polymerase molecules that are in the form of RNPs containing either vRNA or cRNA (te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016; York et al., 2013) . We therefore propose that a similar inhibition of viral RNA replication would result from TRIM25 binding to all influenza-virus-specific RNPs. Particularly because we also showed that endogenous TRIM25 binds to vRNPs in the nucleus of virusinfected cells, we conclude that TRIM25 binding to influenza-virus-specific RNPs is responsible for the inhibition of viral RNA synthesis in infected cells. Several other TRIM proteins have been shown to restrict influenza A virus, but the exact mechanisms have not been determined in these cases (Di Pietro et al., 2013; Fu et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2014) .",

Gibbon TRIM25 is a more potent inhibitor of influenza A virus RNA synthesis than human TRIM25, presumably because human influenza A viruses have not been exposed to gibbon TRIM25. The high anti-influenza-virus activity of gibbon TRIM25 and the other nonhuman primate TRIM25 proteins that were tested suggests that nonhuman primate species also have immune systems directed against influenza-like viruses.

A requirement for RNA exposed on the outer surface of vRNPs would explain, at least in part, the lack of TRIM25 inhibition of Sendai virus: its viral RNA is fully sequestered in the interior of its vRNP (Ruigrok et al., 2011) . Because gibbon TRIM25 has a higher affinity than human TRIM25 for influenza vRNPs, but not for its constituent vRNAs, it is likely that TRIM25 recognizes features of vRNPs in addition to the viral RNAs on the outside surface.

            "text": "This interpretation provides an explanation for the effects of TRIM25 on vRNP-catalyzed mRNA synthesis that we observed, and it underlies the model of TRIM25-mediated inhibition of viral mRNA synthesis depicted in Figure 7 . We showed that TRIM25 binding to vRNPs does not inhibit the cap-dependent endonuclease of the viral polymerase that cleaves capped RNAs to generate short capped-RNA primers. This reaction requires the activities of a cap-binding domain in the PB2 protein and an endonuclease domain in the PA protein, and it requires that these two domains are positioned at a specific distance from each other Reich et al., 2014) . Because this positioning requires multiple interactions between all three polymerase subunits, we conclude that none of the three polymerase subunits are perturbed by TRIM25 binding. In addition, because the catalytic site in the PB1 protein is stabilized by multiple interactions with the PA and PB2 subunits Reich et al., 2014; Wright et al., 2013) , it is unlikely that TRIM25 could negatively impact the PB1 catalytic site without disturbing PA and PB2 functions. Consequently, TRIM25 most likely acts after these initial steps in the initiation of viral mRNA synthesis. Because we did not detect any prematurely terminated RNA chains, it is reasonable to propose that TRIM25 inhibits the onset of mRNA chain elongation. To elongate viral mRNA chains, the viral polymerase needs to pull in the viral RNA template and at the same time displace the NP protein that is associated with the viral RNA (te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016; onset of elongation step in Figure 7A ). However, one or more TRIM25 molecules that are bound to a vRNP would act as clamps on the vRNPassociated viral RNA, thereby blocking the movement of the viral RNA into the polymerase (onset of elongation step in Figure 7B ). By this mechanism, TRIM25 does not directly inhibit polymerase activity, but rather deprives the polymerase access to the viral RNA template. This model is also consistent with the EM images that show TRIM25 binding at various places along the length of vRNPs, with no preferential binding site. No matter where TRIM25 binds, it would block the movement of the viral RNA into the polymerase. We propose that this TRIM25 clamp would also deprive the polymerase of access to vRNA and cRNA templates during viral RNA replication.",

This is compatible with the current model of the mechanism of viral mRNA synthesis Reich et al., 2014; te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016) . Previous results indicated that the PB2 cap-binding site is responsible for positioning the capped RNA primer at the catalytic site for nucleotide addition Reich et al., 2014; te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016) , where the primer begins its binding to the 3 0 end of the vRNA template (the initiation step in Figures 7A and 7B ). Once this positioning is completed, the PB2 cap-binding site dissociates from the cap of the capped RNA primer (Braam et al., 1983; te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016) so that this PB2 site can then participate in the generation of more capped RNA primers. As a result of the dissociation of the PB2 cap-binding site, elongating capped viral mRNAs are free to exit the polymerase (onset of elongation step in Figure 7A ). This dissociation would also allow capped RNA primers that are not elongated in the presence of TRIM25 to exit the polymerase (onset of elongation step in Figure 7B ). The released small capped-RNA primers lacking 3 0 poly A would then be susceptible to degradation by nucleases.",

CRFK cells or human A549 cells in triplicate were infected with the indicated pfu/cell of Udorn or California virus, followed by incubation at 37c C in serum-free complete medium supplemented with 1.0cmg/ml N-acetylated trypsin. To measure virus replication, aliquots of the medium were taken at the indicated times after infection, and virus titers were determined by plaque assays in MDCK cells. To measure viral protein production, CRFK cells or A549 cells were infected with the indicated pfu/cell of Udorn or California virus. Cells collected at the indicated times after infection were extracted using lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% NP-40, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor. After quantifying protein concentration using a Bradford assay (Thermo, #23200), 20 mg of cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblots probed with an antibody against detergent-treated Udorn virus provided by Robert A. Lamb . This antibody detects the NP and M1 proteins of influenza A viruses, and surprisingly detects not only the Udorn virus HA, but also the HA of California virus. Where indicated, a retrovirus encoding either the PR8 WT or R38A/K41A mutant NS1 protein was incubated for 48 hr with the CRFK cells expressing human TRIM25 prior to Ud infection. These two retroviruses were generated in the same way as described above for the retroviruses expressing TRIM proteins. To measure viral mRNA and vRNA production, infected CRFK or A549 cells were harvested at the indicated time after infection using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, #74104). RNA (500 ng) was then used to generate cDNA using either oligo(dT) or virus-specific primers (Table S1) with Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, #18080-051), and the cDNA was used as a template in qPCR with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, #4367659) and virus-or host-specific primers (Table S1 ). Cycling for qPCR was performed using Life Technologies' Vii-A7 (CRFK cell experiments) or Bio-Rad's CFX96 Touch (A549 cell experiments) real-time PCR detection systems.

Purification of His-TRIM25 and His-SUMO The TRIM25 open reading frame was inserted into pFastBac-HTa (Invitrogen, #10712-024) vector downstream of a 6xHis tag using EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. This plasmid was then transformed into DH10Bac cells (Invitrogen, #10359-016) to induce recombination of His-TRIM25 into a Bacmid. Bacmids were isolated and transfected into insect cells to generate baculovirus that harbors His-TRIM25. Sixty 15 cm plates of insect cells were then infected with TRIM25-harboring baculovirus, and cells were collected 48 hr later. Cells were lysed in 40 mL TRIM buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM ZnSO 4 , 10% glycerol, 100 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol), dounced and sonicated, and centrifuged to pellet cell debris.

Beads were eluted using wash buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. Eluates were subjected to fast performance liquid chromatography using a Superdex 200 3.2/300 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare, #29-0362-32). Peak fractions eluted at a volume consistent with TRIM25 tetramers (285 kDa). However, a previous study that also observed apparent TRIM25 tetramers from a Superdex 200 column went on to show that TRIM25 from peak fractions actually exist as dimers in solution and that the apparent higher molecular weight of TRIM25 in gel filtration is likely due to its elongated shape",

To assay the cap-dependent endonuclease, the pGEM-9Zf(-) vector (Promega) was cleaved with Sal1 followed by transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase to yield a 42 base-long RNA. A 32 P-labeled cap1 structure was added to the 5' end of this RNA by incubation with the vaccinia capping enzyme and mRNA cap 2 0 -O-methyltransferase (both from New England Biolabs) in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine and (a-32 P) GTP under the conditions described by the supplier of the enzymes. The cap-labeled 42 base-long RNA was purified by SDS gel electrophoresis. The assay for the cap-dependent endonuclease was carried out for 30 minutes at 30 C in a reaction mixture of 50 ml containing ( 32 P)-cap-labeled 42 base-long RNA, 5 ml of vRNP, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM KCI, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl 2 . To assay for the incorporation of the capped primer into mRNA, ATP, GTP, CTP and UTP (each at 1 mM) was added to the reaction mixture. The capped RNA species were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS PAGE gels.

These GFP-tagged constructs were used as templates for a subsequent gateway cloning reaction for placement into the pLPCX retroviral packaging plasmid. The pLPCX plasmids containing TRIM25-GFP constructs were used for packaging retrovirus in 293T cells, which was then used to generate stable cell lines in RIG-I/TRIM25 knockout A549 cells (see Experimental Model and Subject Details for stable cell line generation)",
