According to some sources, the first estimated date of reported COVID-19 cases was in December 2019 [3] . Due to the continuous rise in confirmed international COVID-19 cases, it remains uncertain whether a further uncontrolled virus outbreak can be prevented. One probable scenario suggests that COVID-19 cases outside of China might spread and remain undetected for a relevant time period, resulting in delayed countermeasures in many countries. In fact, new current disease epicenters have formed in Italy, Japan, South Korea and Iran.",
