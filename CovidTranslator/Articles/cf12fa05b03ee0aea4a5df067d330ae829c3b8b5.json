Bioregionalisation is an emergent process. It is visible where societies have begun grappling with complex socio-ecological problems by establishing place-based (territorial) approaches to securing health and well-being. This article examines a bioregional effort to merge place-based health planning and ecological restoration along the US-Mexico border. The theoretical construct underpinning this effort is called One Bioregion/One Health (OBROH). OBROH frames health as a transborder phenomenon that involves human-animal-environment interactions. The OBROH approach aims to improve transborder knowledge networking, ecosystem resilience, community participation in sciencesociety relations, leadership development and cross-disciplinary training. It is a theoretically informed narrative to guide action. OBROH is part of a paradigm shift evident worldwide; it is redefining human-ecological relationships in the quest for healthy place making. The article concludes on a forward-looking note about the promise of environmental epidemiology, telecoupling, ecological restoration, the engaged university and bioregional justice as concepts pertinent to reinventing place-based planning.",

The OBROH narrative interweaves (1) emergent discourse in urban and regional planning that focuses on the built environment in relationship to health (e.g. urban design for walkability and active living, watershed management for pollution prevention) with (2) emergent discourse in public health and epidemiology that widens the circle of concern for human health to include human-animal-environment interactions. These two discourses have begun to document how ecosystem integrity is vital to human as well as non-human health. In this light, ecological restoration is becoming an important part of the",

The estuary drains the TRW. Sediment, waste tyres, raw sewage, contaminated storm water and invasive species all flow into the estuary from the rapidly urbanising watershed. These inputs have been recognised, and management with a watershed approach (i.e., place-based strategies that take into account biogeography and water flow paths) is currently getting much attention at the Tijuana River. Two notable collaborative efforts include the Tijuana River Valley Recovery Team and the International Boundary and Water Commissions Watershed Initiative effort for the Tijuana River Valley. Using the watershed as the unit of analysis and framework for intervention is important when addressing ecological restoration and environmental public health. The Tijuana River Valley is home to a variety of birds and other wildlife but it is not only biodiversity that is at risk. Human health is also potentially at risk. The estuary is a filter but it is an overloaded filter and the health of the communities surrounding the estuary depends on the health of the estuary. The estuary is also home to antibiotic-resistant bacteria and mosquitoes that could carry West Nile, dengue and yellow fever. 8 Water contaminated with sewage often flows into the estuary, leading to beach closures north of the river mouth on the US side of the border (notably in Imperial Beach, the Tijuana Slough National Wildlife Refuge, and Border Field State Park).",

The Mexicali-Calexico twin city is located in a shared valley region known as the Mexicali Valley on the Mexico side and the Imperial Valley on the US side. The New River that runs through this twin city is one of the most polluted in the United States. 9 Its south-to-north flow through the valley from Mexico into the US, ending up in the Salton Sea, drains agricultural and urban runoff containing pesticides, raw sewage, industrial waste and many other contaminants. Although there are no epidemiological studies to demonstrate it, residents along the path of the New River on the US side attribute clusters of cancer to the toxicants in the waterway. 10 Efforts to scientifically link such cancers to the New River have been hampered by the difficulty of determining the degree of human exposure to the toxicants carried by the river. Cancer develops over decades and a large number of cancer cases with appropriate exposure assessment and lifestyle history are needed to delineate such an association. A large population of Mexican residents in Mexicali is probably exposed to similar contaminants from the New River. A bioregional-scale epidemiological study along the New River on both sides of the border would help shed light on the health risks faced by people living in the shared valley.",

Jason Corburn describes how society and the field of public health have a tendency to search \"for one big cause or explanation of differences in health outcomes across populations, from nineteenth-century theories of miasma and contagion to medical care and genetic explanations of the twenty-first century.\" 11 It is now proposed that this issue is far more complicated. The US-Mexico border region is a prime place to integrate healthy city planning and the concept of One Health within a bioregional framework. One Health advocates argue, \"larger and more sustainable health benefits will result if research and interventions are collaborative across human, animal (domestic and wildlife), and ecosystem health sectors rather than targeted at each of these factors individually and in isolation from each other.\" 12 Urban health researchers and professionals are exploring \"how a combination of place-based physical, economic and social characteristics and the public policies and institutions that shape them-not just genetics, lifestyles or health care-are the cause of inequitable distributions of well-being in cities.\" 13 Public health researchers refer to epigenetics, which suggests that genetic expression (which can give rise to cancer or other diseases) or cellular phenotype (observable physical characteristics or traits) may be caused by mechanisms other than DNA-for instance environmental exposures. Epigenetics is defined as a bridge between genotype (the inherited instructions embodied within an organism's genetic code) and phenotype and is a phenomenon that changes the final outcome of a locus or chromosome without changing the underlying DNA sequence. 14 In other words, our health is not entirely hard wired genetically speaking (i.e., there is some plasticity in gene expression that goes beyond what we inherit from our parents). Public health researchers are beginning to take into account cumulative health risks posed by environmental exposures, stress, diet and behaviour. From this perspective, the qualities of a place (as measured, for instance, by the condition of its air, water, land, safety, neighbourliness, access to fresh fruits and vegetables, built environment and infrastructure for active living like walking and biking) are key determinants of health. 15 Herein lies the theoretical and practical justification for merging the One Bioregion concept with the One Health concept",

            "text": "Scholars are calling for more place-based ecological integrity along borders where cityregions have in effect become transfrontier societies. 17 The OBROH narrative is one of the responses to this quest to achieve ecological integrity through place-based approaches. At the heart of bioregional theory and practice is this core guiding principle: human beings are social animals; if we are to survive as a species we need healthy relationships and secure attachments with one another and with the land, waters, habitat, plants and animals upon which we depend. This is not a new principle; bioregional scholars, ethicists, poets and leaders of bioregional movements around the world have been embracing it for decades. 18 Bioregion as a term combines the Greek word for life (bios) with the Latin word for territory (regia) and the Latin term for ruling/governing (regere). Bioregion thus means \"life territory\" or \"lifeplace.\" The bioregionalisation of health policy and planning faces three major challenges: (1) Rebuilding urban and rural communities-on a human scale-to nurture a healthy sense of place, secure attachments and rootedness among community inhabitants; (2) Reintegrating nature and human settlements in ways that holistically instil eco-efficiency, resilience, equity and green cultural values into systems of production, consumption and daily life; and (3) Making known (and valuing) how wildlands, working landscapes, ecological services and rural livelihoods enable cities to exist. To meet these three challenges, bioregionalists advocate localisation. Localisation includes strategies designed to create sustainable and resilient communities on a human scale by fostering local investments in nearby natural resources, rooted livelihoods and institutions thereby augmenting a community's assets (including community power/capabilities). 19 The spatial scale of bioregional initiatives varies. Bioregionalists focus on watersheds (\"ridge top to ridge top\"), multiple watersheds (\"landscape scale\"), river basins and even much larger swaths of the earth's surface. These scales are nested one within the other. Peter Berg and Raymond Dasmann coined the most widely cited definition of a bioregion; they describe it as referring to both a geographical terrain and a terrain of consciousness. In other words, the boundary that makes up a particular bioregion is not strictly determined by the lay of the land (i.e. its geography or biome). The bioregion also has a cultural dimension shaped by how people live in and identify with the place. 20 Bioregional boundaries, as defined by local inhabitants themselves, thus take a range of factors into account-most often including climate, topography, flora, fauna, soil and water together with the territory's socio-cultural characteristics, economy and human settlement patterns. Robert L. Thayer, Jr., a widely noted bioregional activist-scholar, aptly argues, \"the bioregion is emerging as the most logical locus and scale for a sustainable, regenerative community to take root and to take place.\" 21 The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is using watershed boundaries for its Border Environmental Health Initiative Regions project (see Figure 2 ). The USGS chose this delineation rather than the administrative boundary established by the 1983 La Paz agreement, which defines the border region as the area extending 100 kilometres north and 100 kilometres south of the international boundary line. The USGS rationale for this decision is that watersheds provide more meaningful and useful units of analysis when tackling transboundary socio-ecological challenges.",

Yet national and international efforts are helping to reframe public discourse, thereby creating new opportunities to advance bioregionalism's core commitments, including ecological restoration in urban and rural settings as well as in protected areas and working landscapes. This trend is evident in the 2013-2014 GNEB deliberations. 23 The OBROH approach builds on bioregional theory and the work of those who have advocated \"One Border/One Health\" (OBOH). By intentionally integrating bioregional theory, principles of ecological restoration and One Health, the OBROH approach can help us get beyond two types of bias that constrain efforts to realise the kind of paradigm shift we need to bring about healthy place making and sustainability. The two biases are: (1) metrocentric-a fixation on cities in a way that ignores or undervalues the socio-ecological systems that interdependently bind urban and rural lifeplaces; and (2) anthropocentric-a failure to adequately take into account how human, animal and plant health are increasingly interconnected. The One Health paradigm acknowledges that human health is inseparable from the health of animals and the planet as a whole. 24",

While human activity has impacted ecosystems for thousands of years, the past century has witnessed unprecedented rapid human population growth and economic development, driving extensive ecological changes and the emergence of both new and previously recognised infectious diseases. These activities include the encroachment into or destruction of wildlife habitat, agricultural land use changes, deforestation and habitat fragmentation, uncontrolled urbanisation, construction of dams and irrigation canals, release of chemical pollutants, intensive livestock production, climate changes, international travel and trade and human migration and settlement, as well as the emergence of new disease vectors, in the wake of increasingly globalised flows of life forms and other materials.",

Quite recently, two additional novel viruses have emerged-the H7N9 influenza virus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-causing concern to public health experts worldwide. In today's interconnected world, \"in the context of infectious diseases, there is nowhere in the world from which we are remote and no one from whom we are disconnected.\" 26 Underlying this threat is the awareness that while the initial response to any infectious disease outbreak is primarily the responsibility of the domestic government, infectious diseases do not respect national borders and the failure of control measures in one country has the potential to put neighbouring countries and the health security of the entire world at risk. The spread of zoonotic diseases in the late 20th century and early 21st century has inspired a new discipline known as \"Global Health.\" Global Health approaches environmental public health as a transborder phenomenon and thus fits well within the OBROH narrative presented here.",

The overarching goal of EWIDS was to improve cross-border early warning of infectious diseases in North America and build the capacity of public health systems in the US border states with a focus on infectious disease with a major public health impact (e.g. bioterrorism agents, emerging and re-emerging pathogens, pandemic influenza).

These interfaces pose a significant risk to animal, human, environmental and plant health, as evidenced by frequent wildlife die-offs, antibiotic-resistant bacteria in streams, beach closures due to faecal contamination, pesticide toxicities, zoonotic infectious disease outbreaks and vector-borne diseases. 27 With the increasing awareness that prompt detection, diagnosis and response to newly emerging infectious diseases requires working outside of traditional disciplinary silos and forging new multi-sectoral partnerships, and the recognition of the marked absence of any organisation comprehensively addressing the health risks posed by these complex interfaces, EWIDS founded One Border/One Health (OBOH) in June 2011. This effort connected individuals representing multiple sectors in the California-Baja California region in order to address emerging diseases, risk factors contributing to the region's susceptibility, and actions to monitor and intervene such as establishing joint animal-human surveillance systems for early warning of emerging infectious diseases. Cooperating across both jurisdictional and sectorial boundaries and the formation of groups such as the OBOH are critical to creating sustainable solutions to health risks at the humananimal-environmental interface and building resilient communities. 28 The OBOH was successful in encouraging scholars and practitioners to work collaboratively in order to establish a process for (1) enhancing surveillance for emerging and re-emerging pathogens using the One Health concept, (2) developing mechanisms for data collection and exchange among stakeholders, and (3) raising community awareness to integrate the One Health concept in education and training. 29 Table 1 summarises key features of the One Border/One Health approach.

Over the past decade, the seven mile stretch of Los Laureles Canyon grew in numbers from practically 0 to 70,000 people, many of whom lack basic urban services (e.g. a functioning sewer system, trash collection, paved roads). As is the case in many of Tijuana's canyons, Los Laureles has numerous unregulated dumpsites, containing wastes from diverse sources (e.g. hospitals, industry, construction, households). Los Laureles Canyon has a south-to-north topographical tilt to it as part of the Tijuana River Watershed, so although it lies in Tijuana, Mexico, all drainage through the canyon flows across the US-Mexico border into the USA. During the spring of 2013, UCSD and UABC faculty, researchers and students, assisted by Alter Terra, carried out 388 face-to-face interviews in targeted neighbourhoods of Los Laureles. 43 The survey asked questions about demographics, water hygiene and sanitation, healthrelated discomforts and symptoms, disease history, public safety and services, and access to medical care. It is the first stage in a long-term epidemiological plan to causally link exposure to toxicants with health outcomes. The effort is motivated by the working hypothesis that exposures to hazardous substances (e.g. in contaminated air, water, land, plants, animals) are taking place and causing negative health impacts, not only among the canyon's residents living in close proximity to the dumps, but also downstream in human and biotic communities on the US side of the border.",

This stems in part from the increasing stress being placed on universities to enhance regional innovation and competitiveness \"via harnessing the economic benefit of science and knowledge, in which the sub-national scale plays an important role.\" 48 On the other hand, some university leaders and scholars aim to make the academy more accountable from social justice and equity standpoints involving critical pedagogy and civically engaged research and service learning. These two types of engagement are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Harloe and Perry argue that these trajectories constitute a mixed bag including opportunities and threats embodied in conflicts over the university's mission, internal culture, governance and allocation of resources. 49 The Superfund Research Center (SRC) at UCSD is one example where the effort to advance civically engaged research is happening. The SRC is integrating community knowledge and research through a bioregional approach. 50 Taking into account goals spelled out by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Border 2020 Program and the GNEB, the UCSD SRC has focused on sites on both sides of the US-Mexico border. The focus in Mexico has been on Los Laureles Canyon, a seven mile stretch of canyon land in the Tijuana River Watershed. 51 In the US, the UCSD SRC has focused on San Diego's Pueblo Watershed contaminated by diffuse sources of pollution. 52",

For instance, health quality is partly determined by the degree to which one enjoys a secure sense of attachment to a safe and convivial lifeplace (i.e. rootedness). From this perspective, it is fruitful to join bioregional theory and practice with the insights and institutional advances made by One Health advocates. The OBROH narrative helps draw attention to the 21st century's socio-ecological stresses and the concomitant need to better align political economy and ecology. Such an alignment is crucial to the challenge of establishing healthy place-based planning that can cultivate just, resilient and sustainable communities.

The unit of analysis in telecoupling research is not a discrete place; rather it is relationships among places (i.e. human-nature interactions in the space of flows that interdependently bind the fate of people and places across distances). 56 At its 98th annual meeting in 2013, the Ecological Society of America held a symposium focused on \"Ecological Sustainability in a Telecoupled World.\" Enthusiasts of the telecoupling framework (with its emphasis on CHANS, flows, agents, causes and effects) spelled out its benefits:",

Bioregional justice thus integrates multiple layers of justice (e.g. social, economic, environmental, global) by advancing a unifying place-based approach to improving the land, ecosystems and urban-rural relationships in a particular bioregion. Bioregional justice ensures that the benefits, opportunities and risks arising from creating, operating and living in a territorially bounded network of human settlements (i.e. a bioregion where urban-ruralwildland spaces co-evolve socially, culturally and ecologically) are shared equitably through healthy relationships and secure place-based attachments.

It is wrong when it tends otherwise.\" 58 Leopold understood that land is more than soil; it is \"a fountain of energy flowing through a circuit of soils, plants, and animals.\" 59 The land ethic (like OBROH) \"enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land.\" 60 Establishing an ethic to realise bioregional justice (i.e. a placebased ecopolity where fairness and healthy resilience prevails in how we relate with one another and with the land, waters, habitat, plants and animals upon which we depend) is not just an ecological challenge; it is also a socio-political, economic, cultural and aesthetic challenge. The great urban and regional visionary Lewis Mumford stated this view poignantly over three-quarters of a century ago (a perspective as relevant today as it was then): \"The re-animation and re-building of regions, as deliberate works of collective art, is the grand task of politics for the coming generation.\" 61",
