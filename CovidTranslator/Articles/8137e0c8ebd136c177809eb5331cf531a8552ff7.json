            "text": "Autoantibodies are a key feature of IIM, in common with other autoimmune rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. Myositis-specific autoantibodies, present in approximately 60%-70% of individuals with IIM, are directed against a range of cytoplasmic or nuclear components involved in key intracellular processes, including protein synthesis and chromatin re-modelling . These myositis-specific autoantibodies are often associated with particular clinical features. Individuals with autoantibodies targeting the cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensor MDA5 (also called interferon induced with helicase C domain 1, IFIH1) can present with rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease which is associated with high mortality (Abe et al., 2017; Betteridge et al., 2019) . Several members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family are known autoantibody targets in IIM, and there is a strong temporal association between adult-onset dermatomyositis and malignancy onset in individuals with antibodies to transcription intermediary factor 1\u03b3 (TIF1\u03b3, TRIM33) (Oldroyd et al., 2019) . Many TRIM proteins are important immune regulators (van Tol et al., 2017; Versteeg et al., 2014) , and dysregulation of TRIM proteins leading to reduced ability to restrict viral infection has been reported in several autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and inflammatory bowel disease (Oke et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2018) .",

Competitive bio-panning was applied to pooled total immunoglobulin fractions (IgA, IgG, IgM) purified from the plasma of twenty anti-TIF1 positive adult-onset dermatomyositis patients (DM) and twenty healthy controls (HC) ( Table S1 ). Four sample pools were generated and paired: the first pair contained 10 pooled samples (P10) of DM (DM P10) used for competitive biopanning against 10 pooled samples of HC (HC P10) ( Table S1 ). The second pair included 20 pooled samples (P20) of DM (DM P20) used for competitive biopanning against 20 pooled samples of HC (HC P20) (Table S1 ). Figure 1 and figure S1 detail achieved metrics while defining the microbial and autoantibody immunogenic repertoires in DM and HC. We retrieved \u224836 million (DM) and \u224824 million (HC) next generation sequencing (NGS) reads which represent 8.7 million (DM) and 4.7 million (HC) expressed epitopes. Cohorts presented highly enriched epitope sequences that are unique to DM (15, 522) and HC (4,817) respectively. Our epitope cohorts retrieved 6.75 million (DM) and 2.25 million (HC) microbial or human protein annotations respectively which mapped to 9,111 (DM) and 4,994 (HC) Distinct species. 6,202 Unique species were identified in DM while 2,085 Unique species were identified in HC.",

In both groups the highest level of richness (number of different species) was observed for bacteria, followed by viruses, fungi and archaea (Figure S2A & S2B) . We defined distinct epitopes as being any discrete epitope sequence retrieved from the DM and HC groups. Unique distinct epitopes represent any discrete epitope sequences which were observed exclusively in either DM or HC. Common distinct epitopes were discrete epitope sequences that were observed in both DM and HC groups by sequence and at a minimum of five-fold the NGS enrichment frequency in one group vs the other group. Unique distinct epitopes represented the vast majority of sequences observed (Fig 1) . Based on the distribution of the corresponding microbial species in the pools of 10 and 20 the majority of distinct species are shared between the P20 and P10 samples, whereas the majority of unique species are observed either in P20 or in P10, in both DM and HC ( Figure S2C & S2D, respectively). These data demonstrate the presence of a stably-enriched microbial component in DM ( Figure S2A ) and also in HC ( Figure S2B ).",

The epitope was poorly conserved amongst the DM-specific TRIM proteins ( Figure 7B ). Overall, we have identified two epitope sequences that are shared between Variola virus and TRIM3 but also between members of the Poxviridae family. A third epitope that is shared between TRIM47, HIV-1 and Syn9 was also observed. These findings suggest that molecular mimicry events, at least amongst these specific viral and TRIM epitopes, is a potential mechanism of pathogenesis in DM.",

We used an un-targeted high-throughput approach which combines immunoglobulin disease-specific enrichment of immunogenic epitopes, and subsequent identification of anti-microbial antibody and autoantibody richness and abundance. Key findings include that (1) the DM-specific IgOme was characterised by high microbial diversity, (2) antibodies against viruses were over-represented and species of the Poxviridae family were significantly enriched, (3) DM-specific accumulated autoantibodies target a significant portion of the human proteome, including proteins from specific biological processes and interferon regulated proteins, (4) autoantibodies against TRIM33 and eleven further TRIM proteins were identified, and (5) specific TRIM proteins share epitope homology with viral species identified from the plasma of DM patients.",

The effect of sample size in our measurements suggests increased microbial exposure and interpersonal variability in the DM compared to the healthy group, leading to expansion of the identified DM-specific microbial signature upon screening additional samples. Even though our observations provide a static snapshot of the IgOme, the immune system has a memory and the accumulation of antibodies takes place from birth over the entire lifetime of the individual.

This was double the proportion compared to the HC-enriched proteome, with only 13% of autoantibodies being found in both DM and healthy controls, suggesting accumulation of autoantibodies in DM against a wider group of proteins. Interestingly three times the number of autoantibody targeted proteins were regulated by type I and II interferons in DM than in HC. This underscores the relevance of interferons in this disease (Neely, 2019; Somani et al., 2008) , and indicates the potential of interferon blockade as a therapy. The identification with high confidence of specific biological processes enriched in both DM and HC, suggests an organisational structure within the targets of these accumulated autoantibodies. Although deconvolution to individual samples is not possible with our data, this is consistent with an infection (exposure)-driven pathological autoantibodyproducing mechanism which progressively expands its repertoire (antigens) under the chronic burden of accumulated stimuli (Chan and Gack, 2016; Cusick et al., 2012; Munz et al., 2009; Panoutsakopoulou et al., 2001) . Biological processes enriched in DM are orientated around cytoskeletal organisation, microtubule movement, actin filaments and cell junctions. Eight of the identified protein targets participated in most of these processes indicating a key role in the regulation of multiple signalling pathways including the formation and disassembly of focal adhesions. The enrichment of antibodies against proteins with a role in the regulation of focal cell-cell adhesion in DM is particularly interesting, since disruption of these structures in epithelial cells is known to .

TRIM21 (Ro52) is a known autoantigen in IIM and related autoimmune disorders, and acts as the highestaffinity Fc receptor in humans. TRIM21 binds cytosolic antibodies bound to non-enveloped viral pathogens, to trigger antibody-dependent intracellular neutralization and proteasomal degradation of the immune complex (Lee, 2017; Rajsbaum et al., 2014) . The autoantibodies we identified against TRIM proteins, other than TRIM33 and TRIM21, have not been observed previously in IIM. TRIM69 inhibits vesicular stomatitis virus transcription and interacts with dengue virus non-structural protein 3 to mediate its poly-ubiquitination and degradation (Kueck et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018) .

We identified epitope sequences with high similarity between TRIM3 and Variola virus in addition to other members of the Poxviridae family. Moreover, TRIM47 had epitopes in common with HIV1 and Synechococcus phage. These high similarity epitopes were identified in the C-terminus of the TRIM proteins; between the filamin and NHL 1 domains for TRIM3, and proximal to the B30.2 domain in TRIM47. The C-terminus of TRIM proteins is under evolutionary positive selection and determines ligand binding specificity, function and subcellular localization; notably the B30.2 domain is associated with ability to restrict viral infection, particularly retroviruses (van Tol et al., 2017) . This finding of high similarity epitope sequences suggests that molecular mimicry, at least amongst specific viral and TRIM epitopes, is a potential mechanism of pathogenesis in DM.",

TRIM epitopes did not form a separate phylogenetic cluster but were dispersed throughout the viral epitope phylogenetic tree, suggesting that accumulated antibodies against TRIM proteins might be the product of a primal molecular mimicry event and subsequent epitope spreading rather than increased TRIM protein production. This is supported by the observation that the gene expression levels of autoantigens in myositis muscle biopsies do not correlate with the levels of circulating autoantibodies recognizing each cognate endogenous autoantigen; instead they are directly associated with the expression of muscle regeneration markers (Pinal-Fernandez et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "We propose a model whereby pathogenesis of DM is dependent on dynamic and personalised viral exposure patterns, which start very early in life. The main two gateways of physiological transmission of viruses to humans are the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems, while non-physiological presentation of viruses is through immunisation. The link between DM and viruses is complex but strikingly present in our data since there is systematic enrichment for human proteome modules that are directly exploited by, or respond to, most of the viruses that we identified. We propose that an initial viral infection or virus delivery system presents the main antigen that induces antigen-specific antibody production in a predisposed immune environment. Since TRIM proteins share epitope homology with multiple viral species, these antibodies can also bind to TRIMs and potentially other homologous proteins. The outcome of this process is influenced by factors including the antibody populations at the site of infection (local antibodies), the status of the innate immune system, the virusspecific antibody concentration in serum (which usually peaks several weeks post infection), and the history of previous exposure primarily to the same or related viral strains (and epitopes) (Rojas et al., 2018) . Since HLA Class II molecules are major regulators of the adaptive immune response to antigenic challenge through T cell repertoire selection, the level of antibody production to different .

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . viral antigens also may be mediated by HLA type. We previously identified that adult-onset anti-TIF1 positive DM is associated with HLA-DQB1*02:02 (Rothwell et al., 2019) . For the samples with available data included in this study, we observed that 6/15 (40%) DM and 3/17 (18%) HC are heterozygous for HLA-DQB1*02:02. The finding that in myositis, autoantigen expression correlates with expression of muscle regeneration markers (Pinal-Fernandez et al., 2019) suggests that after initial viral presentation, the increased concentrations of muscle proteins may then be sufficient even in the absence of viral proteins to invoke periodic rises of autoantibodies. Moreover, the continuous activation of innate immunity observed in DM (Neely, 2019; Pinal-Fernandez et al., 2019; Walsh et al., 2007; Wong et al., 2012) can also potentiate autoimmunity through chronic immune-mediated tissue damage resulting in autoantigen release without the need for specific activation of auto-reactive T cells by a microbial mimic (Panoutsakopoulou et al., 2001) . Therefore, following the initial viral exposure there is a high chance that this effect will spread amongst related proteins within specific signalling pathways (since protein homology is related to function) of the initial hit. In this model, in specific autoantibody-positive myositis subgroups, accumulated autoantibodies against proteins that participate in specific biological processes and signalling pathways would be observed. The finding that in healthy controls the protein coverage of the GO processes significantly decreases suggests more random targeting of human proteins by autoantibodies, opposite to that observed in DM and in support of our hypothesis.",

SARA comprises a comprehensive workflow that integrates molecular biology peptide display and epitope signature enrichment through competitive bio-panning and high-throughput DNA next generation sequencing (NGS), alongside in-house computational scripts to reverse engineer high resolution epitope signatures that reflect original in vivo epitopes present in patient sera. SARA was applied to predict the identity and abundance of antibody epitope repertoires enriched in plasma from anti-TIF1 autoantibody-positive DM patients versus plasma from matched HC (see Supplementary   Methods) . This pipeline provides a digital triage of infectious organism epitopes and autoantibodies predicted to be uniquely present or highly enriched in each sera pool.

Preferential enrichment for epitopes of length 11 and 12 AAs (Fig. S1D ) confirmed genuine biopanning capture and is concordant with published peptide epitope ranges of 4 to 12 AAs (Buus et al., 2012; Hopp and Woods, 1981) . Minimum epitope lengths of 9AA applied with the 10-\u03c3-99 NGS filter (above) proved optimal for annotation ( Fig. S1E ) using the unique sequence epitope sets of 15,522 for DM and 4,817 for HC individuals (Fig.   S1F ). Ig repertoire sequence overlap determined that only 0.65% of DM epitope set were present in healthy controls (fold-change (FC) values of >=5x to 546x abundance vs HC individuals) while 6.44% of healthy epitope set was retained in the DM group (FC values of >=5.3x to 1240x vs DM) (Fig. S1F) .",

Coronaviridae was the most enriched consisting of primarily SARS coronaviruses, Orthomyxoviridae contained primarily Influenza A viruses, Herpesviridae included A and B groups, various Geminiviridae plant viruses probably due to immune exposure via the gastrointestinal tract, and finally the Poxviridae Smallpox (Variola) and vaccinia viruses. Notably, epitopes against the Poxviridae species had the highest abundance. The smallpox virus Variola was eradicated by introduction of the vaccinia virus (VACV)-based vaccine (Sanchez-Sampedro et al., 2015). The last world-wide vaccination program was in 1967(Sanchez-Sampedro et al., 2015), and smallpox immunity persists for up to 88 years (Taub et al., 2008), therefore given the age of our donors, it is very likely that the DM associated antibodies to Poxviridae were raised through the vaccination process. This is supported by the fact that VACV antibodies were observed in the healthy sample without being enriched. Many other viral species capable of directly infecting muscle tissue were enriched in DM including Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV), multiple Human papillomavirus virus (HPV) strains, Hepatitis C and B (HBV), Enterovirus A71 and Foot-and-mouth disease virus, Human parvovirus B19, and Human Adenovirus and Rotaviruses which have been identified in sporadic cases of infectious myositis(Crum-Cianflone, 2008, 2010; Xiu et al., 2013).

(C) Protein-protein interaction graph of autoantibody targets enriched in DM, and (D) enriched in the healthy sample. Each node represents an identified protein. Edges between two nodes represent confidence of interaction. Active interaction resources included experiments, genefusion, co-occurrence, and co-expression. The minimum required score for a valid interaction was set to 0.700 (high confidence) (STRING 11.0)(Szklarczyk et al., 2019). Disconnected nodes were hidden in the networks.",
