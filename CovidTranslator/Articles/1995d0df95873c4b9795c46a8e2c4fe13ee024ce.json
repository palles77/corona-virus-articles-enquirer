            "text": "Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is the causative agent of acute diarrhea of newborn piglets that provokes high mortality rates in affected farms. In this study, specific immunoglobulin from egg yolk against TGEV was produced by immunization of White leghorn hens. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and virus neutralization (VN) test revealed that the specific antibody titer started to increase on the tenth day post-immunization, reached its peak on the eighth week, and remained at a high level until the last week that we tested. The prophylactic and therapeutic effects of egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) was investigated in piglets. IgY was found effective to increase piglets survival rate significantly after challenge exposures in prophylactic efficacy analysis. The therapeutic effects test revealed that the mortality was dramatically reduced by orally administered IgY. All these results in our study indicated that IgY specific to TGEV could be an alternative prophylactic method like colostral antibodies against TGEV in piglets.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a pleomorphic enveloped RNA virus with single-stranded, positive-sense genome. This virus belongs to the family Coronaviridae (Siddell et al., 1983) and it causes a highly contagious enteric infection in swine of all ages (Saif and Wesley, 1999) . The disease is especially severe in newborn animals less than 2 weeks old in which mortality approaches 100% (Yan et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2005) . Although there are several commercially available TGEV vaccines, either inactivated or attenuated, these do not fully protect piglets (Tuboly and Nagy, 2001; Liu et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2007) . Immunoprotection for newborn piglets mainly consists of passive immunity through colostral immunoglobulin from the immunized dam (Kweon et al., 2000; Li, 2003) . It suggests that passively derived antibodies are important in piglets for protection against infectious enteric disease. The results of previous studies have shown that passive immunization upon oral administration of antibodies can be effective in preventing intestinal infection (Carlander et al., 2000; Sarker et al., 2001; Song et al., 2003) . However, oral administration of antibodies is prohibitively expensive when large amounts of antibodies are required (Shin et al., 2002; Song et al., 2003) .",

An average egg may contain 100-150 mg yolk immunoglobulin, and substantial amounts of specific antibodies may be collected and purified from the eggs of immunized hens (Akita and Nakai., 1993; Li et al., 2006) . Therefore, IgY from immunized chickens has been considered to be an inexpensive, convenient source for specific antibodies on a large scale (Kweon et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2004) . And its therapeutic application has been assessed by passive immunization therapy through oral ingestion, as in fortified food products for prevention or control of intestinal infection, such as those caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (Hennig-Pauka et al., 2003; Ding et al., 2008) , Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (Sunwoo et al., 1996) , and rotavirus (Sarker et al., 2001; Li et al., 2006) . Other studies also showed that IgY was effective, safe and protective, especially against intestinal infection, indicating similar biological activities to colostral antibodies in neonatal pigs (Yokoyama et al., 1993; Li, 2003) . These studies provide a potential advantage of using IgY specifically to TGEV for preventing and controlling porcine transmissible gastroenteritis. The purpose of our study was to produce IgY against TGEV and investigate its immunoprophylactic effect in neonatal pigs.",

ELISA was carried out in 96 well flat bottom microtiter plates (COSTAR). Each well was coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with purified TGEV antigen which was diluted in coating buffer. After 3 cycles of washing with PBS solution containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T), 250 \u03bcL volumes of blocking buffer (0.5% poly vinyl alcohol in PBS) were added, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. After washing for three times, 100 \u03bcL volumes of appropriately diluted IgY preparations were added to the wells. The plates were washed as described above after incubation for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. One hundred \u03bcL of HRP-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG (invitrogen) were added. After an incubation period of 1 hour at 37\u00b0C followed by another 3 cycles of washing, 100 \u03bcL of the substrate solution (0.04% 3, 3\u2032, 5, 5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine in phosphate-citrate buffer (pH5.0) containing 0.02% H 2 O 2 ) was pipetted into the wells, and the plates were allowed to stand for 10 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped with 50 \u03bcL of 2 mol$L -1 H 2 SO 4 per well and the absorbance at 492 nm was read with an Immunoreader BIO RAD 680. The antibody titer was expressed as P/N values, where P represents the OD 492 nm of IgY from immunized hens at a given dilution and N, the OD 492nm of IgY from non-immunized hens at the same dilution.",

IgY has a broad stability to pepsin and can penetrate the intestinal wall of neonatal piglets easily. Its biological activities were similar to colostral antibodies in neonatal pigs (Yang et al., 2007) . Therefore, oral administration of IgY from chicken egg yolk has been used successfully by many researchers in preventing many intestinal diseases (Hennig-Pauka et al., 2003; Sarker et al., 2001; Ding et al., 2008) . In our study, although IgY obtained from hens immunized with TGEV could not completely protect the piglets from death, it dramatically increased the piglets' surival rate which can be confirmed with the prophylactic efficacy analysis. When we tested the therapeutic efficacy of IgY in farms having outbreaks of TGEV, the application of IgY could significantly reduce the mortality of piglets. All the results of this study demonstrated a high preventive efficacy of IgY on TGEV outbreaks and its potential application as an alternative prophylactic method like colostral antibodies against this virus in piglets in the future.
