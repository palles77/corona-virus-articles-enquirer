            "text": "Coronaviruses were discovered in the early 1930s when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens was shown to be caused by a virus now known as avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The first human coronaviruses (HCoV) were discovered in the 1960s. Research with human volunteers at the Common Cold Unit near Salisbury, UK, showed that colds could be induced by nasal washings that did not contain rhinoviruses. Subsequent in-vitro experiments, where nasal swabs from these volunteers were inoculated onto organ cultures of the respiratory tract, revealed the presence of enveloped viruses with the characteristic morphology of coronaviruses as previously described for IBV. The term coronavirus (Latin: corona, crown) was adopted for these agents, reflecting their characteristic fringed appearance in the electron microscope after negative staining. Coronaviruses are now recognized in a range of animal species causing respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological and systemic diseases (Box 57.1). Until the emergence of SARS in 2003, only two, HCoV 229E and OC43, were recognized as human pathogens. Both were causes of the common cold, considered a mild and insignificant illness and thus not a high priority for intensive research. Following the recognition that SARS was caused by a novel coronavirus, two other new HCoVs, NL63 and HKU-1, were found in association with respiratory disease. The renewed interest in this group of viruses has led to the discovery of a plethora of other animal coronaviruses in diverse species and stimulated research on their capacity to cross species-barriers to infect new animal species.",

However, viral load in the upper respiratory tract peaks around days 7-10 of the disease and falls thereafter, while the lung pathology appears to progress through the second week of illness, suggesting that the lung pathology continues to be driven by mechanisms other than viral replication alone. The severity of SARS infection in humans increased with age, and interestingly, a similar phenomenon is also observed in SARS CoV infected mice and primates. The SARS CoV also infects the intestinal epithelium and virus is shed in the faeces. The diarrhoea associated with SARS infection may be related in part to direct infection of the intestinal tract. A possible link between multiple sclerosis and coronaviruses has been investigated for some time. The genomes of Coronavirus 229E and OC43 have been detected in the brain tissue of patients with multiple sclerosis. However, these virus genomes are also detected in persons dying of non-neurological causes and thus the aetiological link between coronaviruses and neurologic disease in humans seems unclear.

SARS CoV was found to retain infectivity on smooth surfaces for longer than some other human respiratory coronaviruses or other respiratory viruses suggesting the potential importance of fomites and indirect contact in its transmission. However, there was also evidence of small-particle aerosol (long-range) airborne transmission associated with aerosol generating procedures (e.g. use of nebulizers, intubation, high-flow oxygen therapy).

SARS was unusual in two respects of its pathophysiology that allowed its transmission to be interrupted by public health measures. Unlike other respiratory viruses where the viral load in the upper respiratory tract and transmission is maximal early in the disease, in SARS, peak viral titres in the upper respiratory tract and maximal transmission typically occurred in the second week. This allowed early case-detection and isolation to interrupt community transmission. Furthermore, most infected persons manifested clinically overt disease, and thus, once symptomatically ill patients were detected and isolated, there was little asymptomatic infection in the community to sustain virus transmission. Other respiratory viral pathogens such as influenza are transmitted soon after, or even before, the manifestation of clinical symptoms and much of the infection remains mild or asymptomatic.

One infected patient from Guangdong travelled to Hong Kong and stayed one day at a hotel there leading to the infection of 15 other guests who travelled onwards to Toronto, Singapore, Hanoi and elsewhere, seeding chains of secondary transmission in different parts of the world.

EM of negatively strained preparations of ultracentrifuged deposits of infected cells showed particles that were compatible in size and morphology to coronaviruses. EM of lung-biopsy tissue also revealed virus-like particles of comparable size. PCR amplicons generated by random primer based RT-PCR assays on infected and non-infected cells were compared and those unique to virus infected cells were genetically sequenced.

However the limited sequence data available on non-SARS coronaviruses needs to alert us to the possibility that PCR primers designed on the basis of currently available viral genetic data may not encompass the full genetic diversity of these viruses. There are also consensus coronavirus-specific primers that are broadly reactive with many human and animal coronavirus types and these have been used to detect novel coronaviruses (e.g. HKU1) but they are typically less sensitive than good type-specific primers.",

Initial investigations of suspected cases did not find conclusive evidence of known respiratory pathogens. The WHO set up a worldwide network of virological laboratories investigating SARS cases which discussed their results in daily teleconferences. Approaches taken to identify a novel pathogen included virus isolation (including cell-lines not typically used to grow respiratory pathogens) and electron microscopy (EM) on respiratory specimens including lung tissue obtained at open-lung biopsy or autopsy. Immunological methods for virus detection require specific antibodies reactive with the virus and PCR or RT-PCR methods predicate knowledge of the viral genetic sequence upon which PCR primers are based, information and reagents not available in the context of the emergence of a novel pathogen. However, consensus primers targeting regions of the viral genome conserved across viral genera or families, low stringency PCR and PCR using random primers are feasible approaches to detect novel pathogens and were deployed in the hunt for the aetiological agent of SARS. The initial findings independently came from three laboratories within the WHO network isolating a cytopathic-effect causing agent in fetal rhesus kidney cell-lines or Vero-E6 cells. Thin section rhinoviruses (the two common aetiological agents of this syndrome) would be attractive. However, there are no validated antiviral drugs or vaccines to contain coronavirus infections so far.",

The fact that natural infections with 229E or OC43 do not provide long-lasting immunity is instructive in this regard. Thus, so far, there is no vaccine for a HCoV that is in clinical use. The severity of SARS led to a concerted effort to develop vaccines for SARS CoV and range of vaccine strategies including inactivated whole virus vaccines, spike-subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines and vaccinia or parainfluenza virus type 3 vectored vaccines have all been tried in experimental animal models, with some providing evidence of efficacy. It has been established that antibody to the spike protein is the key correlate of protection in animal models. However, as there is perceived to be no imminent public health threat from SARS, few of these vaccines have been taken to human clinical trials. Passive immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies that neutralize SARS CoV has also been developed and evaluated in experimental animal models of SARS. ",
