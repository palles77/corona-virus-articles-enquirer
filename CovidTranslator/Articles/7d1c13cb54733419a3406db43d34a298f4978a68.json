Briefly, porcine alveolar macrophages are seeded in a microtitre plate, infected with PRRSV and fixed with paraformaldehyde.",

Unfortunately, not all batches of macrophages were equally sensitive for a PRRSV infection as described by Vynckier and Pensaert (1993) . Furthermore, some sera reacted with the uninfected control macrophages. Sera of sows and piglets younger than 4 weeks in particular caused background staining. Similar problems with field sera were observed by other researchers (Edwards et al., 1992) . Albina et al. (1992) developed an indirect ELISA. The test was simpler, cheaper and more sensitive for the early detection of PRRSV antibodies than the IPMA. However, Edwards et al. (1992) reported similar background colour problems as with the IPMA. In the present study, a blocking ELISA was developed and compared to the IPMA to improve the reliability of the serological diagnosis of PRRS.",

            "text": "The procedure followed for the blocking ELISA was a modification of that described by Callebaut et al. (1982) . Immunoglobulins, purified from a porcine hyperimmune serum against the Belgian PRRSV strain 92V58 (Vynckier and Pensaert, 1993) were used to coat microtitre plates (Nunc, Intermed, Denmark). This IgG preparation was also labelled with horseradish peroxidase according to the method of Wilson and Nakane (1978) and used as conjugate. The antigen was the 7th passage of the PRRSV strain 92V58 on porcine alveolar macrophages. Cells and medium were harvested by freezing and thawing 3 times and were clarified at 300 X g. In preliminary experiments, optimum working dilutions of coating antibodies, antigen and conjugate were determined by chequerboard titrations and used as follows. A microtitre plate was coated by adding 100 ,ul per well of coating antibodies, diluted in 0.05 M carbonate buffer pH 9.6 and overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C. The plate was washed 3 times and antigen was bound to the coated plate by incubation for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with 100 ~1 per well of the PRRSV stock, diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 0.05% Tween-80. After 4 washings, the plate was saturated by adding to each well 10 ~1 of a PRRSV negative porcine serum and incubated for 1 h at 22\u00b0C. The serum samples to be tested were serially diluted twofold starting at 1: 2.5 in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-80 and 0.35 M NaCl. A 40 ~1 volume of each dilution was added to the plate and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and at 4\u00b0C overnight. Subsequently, 50 ~1 of the PRRSV-specific conjugate appropriately diluted in the serum diluent was added to the serum dilutions and incubation was continued for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After washing the plate 5 times and adding 100 ~1 per well of substrate solution (5-aminosalicylic acid with 0.005% H,O,) plates were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C and the optical density of the wells was determined at 450 nm in Titertekplus MS212 (ICN, California, USA). For every serum sample, the optical densities of the dilutions were corrected by a factor. This factor represented the optical density of a 1: 2.5 dilution of the same serum, tested in a well to which buffer instead of antigen had been added. A serum dilution was considered positive if its corrected optical density was I 50% of the corrected optical density of a PRRSV negative porcine serum. Titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest positive serum dilution.",

            "text": "The sensitivity of the blocking ELISA related to that of the IPMA was determined by testing 50 sera of pigs collected between 3 and 42 days after experimental inoculation with various European strains of PRRSV. Results are shown in Table 1 . The 7 sera taken 3 days after inoculation were negative both in IPMA and ELISA. Five out of the 7 sera coll.ected 7 days after inoculation were negative in IPMA but positive in ELISA, whereas the remaining 2 sera were negative in both tests. Thirty six sera, taken between 10 and 42 days after inoculation, were positive both in IPMA and blocking ELISA. The antibody titers in IPMA were on average 37 times higher than in ELISA probably because the IPMA is an indirect test. In IPMA several peroxidase labelled rabbit-antiswine immunoglobulins may bind to each PRRSV-antibody molecule in the serum sample ;and amplify the signal, but there is no such amplification in the ELISA. The sensitivity of the blocking ELISA compared to the IPMA was optimal, as all sera positive in IPMA were also positive in blocking ELISA: sensitivity = (number of sera positive both in blocking ELISA and IPMA)/( number of sera positive in IPMA) = 36/36 == 1. The finding that sera obtained early (7 days) after inoculation were often positive in the blocking ELISA but not in the IPMA may be due to a more efficient detection of early formed IgM antibodies by ELISA. The immunoglobulin-specific conjugate used in IPMA to detect antibodies in the serum sample, is known to have a higher affinity for IgG than for IgM. This may explain the inefficient detection of IgM in IPMA. On the contrary, in the blocking ELISA all types of immunoglobulins appear to compete with the virus-specific conjugate and to be detected with similar efficiencies.",

At the age between 4 and 12 weeks, blood was taken from piglets of 12 litters on closed breeding-fattening farms, where a previous PRRSV infection had occurred. When tested in IPMA, 35 out of 125 sera caused background staining and interpretation of the result was not possible. The latter sera originated mainly from pigs younger than 6 weeks old. Background colour was not observed in the blocking ELISA. Of the remaining 90 sera, 43 were positive in the blocking ELISA compared to 14 in IPMA (Table 1 ). Sera that were positive in IPMA were also positive in ELISA. Seventeen sera of pigs at the age of 6 weeks and 12 sera of pigs at 10 weeks were negative in IPMA, but positive in the blocking ELISA. Apparently, the blocking ELISA was more sensitive in detecting waning maternal antibodies to PRRSV. The reason for this difference between the blocking ELISA and the IPMA is not clear. Furthermore, a total of 88 blood samples were taken from sows in a slaughterhouse and on closed breeding-fattening farms. Twelve sera caused non-specific reactions in IPMA, while in the blocking ELISA no background staining occurred. Of the remaining 76 sera 53 were positive both in IPMA and ELISA, whereas 17 sera were positive only in ELISA (Table 1) .",
