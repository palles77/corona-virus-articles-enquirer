Results: Six patients (8%) were diagnosed as mild type pneumonia; these patients had no obvious abnormal CT findings or manifested mild changes of lung infection. All 43 patients (59 %) with common type presented unique or multiple ground-glass opacities (GGO) in the periphery of the lungs, with or without interlobular septal thickening. In the 21 patients (29 %) with severe type, extensive GGO and pulmonary consolidation were found in 16 cases (16/21, 76 %) and 5 cases (24 %), respectively. An extensive \"white lung\", with atelectasis and pleural effusion were found in critical type patients (3, 4%). On the resolutive phase of the disease, CT abnormalities showed complete resolution, or demonstrated residual linear opacities. Conclusions: Different CT features are seen according to disease severity, which can help COVID-19 stratification.",

The first patient was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on December 12, 2019. The symptoms of patients were fever, fatigue, dry-cough and the patients gradually developed severe dyspnea. The majority of them had a good prognosis [2, 3] , while a mortality rate of 2.1 % has been recently reported [4] . The average incubation period of the disease was found to be 6.4 days [5] . At present, the diagnosis relies on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or gene sequencing of sputum, throat swab or lower respiratory tract secretion [6] . However, these methods are time-consuming and do not allow assessing the disease severity. Chest CT scanning can provide rapid screening and assess the severity. In this study, we report the CT characteristics of patients with COVID-19 of various severity to provide a more comprehensive overview of the disease, in order to help the clinical diagnosis and management.",

Of course, these hypotheses have not been confirmed by pathological examination. Atelectasis and pleural effusion are rare findings on CT, and were only seen in 1 and 3 cases, respectively in the present study.

The authors' study is of significance for recognizing imaging patterns based on infection time course.

A 27-year-old female patient has fever for 10 days and pharyngalgia for 3 days, with the medical history of contacting with the infected patient. The detection of new coronavirus nucleic acid was positive. A. On admission day, CT scan shows multiple ground-glass opacities and pulmonary consolidation in both lungs. B. Three days after admission, CT scan shows that the density of the foci is lighter and the size is smaller than that at admission day. C. Seven days after treatment, re-examination of CT shows that the lesions in both lungs are further absorbed.",
