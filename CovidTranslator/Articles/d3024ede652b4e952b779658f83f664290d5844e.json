Recent discoveries of several novel viruses have markedly increased the repertoire of agents understood to cause presentations of acute respiratory disease. Objectives: Further understanding is needed of the relative importance of newly discovered pathogens in the clinical setting to provide clinicians with an indication of appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic targets. To address this, quantification of the disease burden of respiratory viruses in hospitalized patients was undertaken. Study design: Disease burden caused by respiratory viruses in hospitalized patients was quantified using the World Health Organization endorsed DALY model. Diagnostic testing results from samples collected over three years for adenovirus (AdV), influenzas A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 and 3 (PIV-1, -2 and -3), respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), and previously published retrospective screening for human metapneumovirus, rhinoviruses, and four respiratory coronaviruses were applied to the DALY model. Disability weights were calculated per 1000 hospitalized patients in age banded groups. Results: Strikingly different disease burden profiles were observed in children and adults. Adenoviruses were among the leading cause of respiratory presentations in children but not adults. HRSV and influenza A were consistently one of the greatest causes of disease regardless of sampled population. Rhinoviruses and PIV-3 were significant pathogens in all groups except those aged 16-64 years. In immunocompromised patients rhinoviruses were the leading viral cause of disease. Conclusions: These analyses provide a framework which can be used to identify where finite resources should be directed in respiratory therapeutics and vaccine development.",

Vaccination to protect from infection with these principal agents of respiratory disease is only widely available for influenzas A and B. In respiratory seasons where HRSV is severely epidemic, HRSV positive patients may be cohorted in attempt to reduce transmission of the virus to other patients. Near patient testing (NPT) for HRSV infection is recommended for infants requiring hospital admission with acute bronchiolitis to facilitate timely cohorting. 6 Only one study has previously attempted to quantify disease burden attributable to respiratory viruses. 7 Respiratory tract infections in community based adults over the age of 60 were prospectively diagnosed, and disease burden associated with a panel of respiratory viruses was quantified using the method of the US Institute of Medicine to prioritise new vaccine development strategies for diseases of importance in the United States.",

The Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) model was endorsed by the World Health Organization in 1996 as a methodology for prioritizing interventions in the health sector based on their potential to reduce burden of disease. DALYs combine time lost due to morbidity and mortality to attribute a single numerical value as a measure of the associated burden caused by a disease outcome.

Where clinical data indicated no LRTI/URTI, associated samples were excluded from disease burden calculations (including samples for which no clinical data was available). Samples collected from 'chronic' patients were excluded.
