Through a series of processes including sample incubation, MTB harvesting, isolation\uff0c purification and identification, several strains of bacteria were isolated from the samples successfully. By Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDXA), these bacteria were certificated to be magnetotactic bacteria. The phylogenetic relationship between the isolated magnetic strains and some known magnetotactic bacteria was inferred by the construction of phylogenetic tree based on 16SrDNA sequences. This apparatus has been proven to have the advantages of being inexpensive, simple to assemble, easy to perform and highly efficient to isolate novel magnetotactic bacteria. The research indicated that the combined approach of harvesting MTB by home-made apparatus and the method of plate colony isolation could purify and isolate magnetotactic bacteria effectively.",

            "text": "Magnetotactic bacteria are a general designation to a group of microorganisms which orient and migrate along geomagnetic field lines. Magnetotactic bacteria are of morphological and habitat diversity. The cells of various morphological types including cocci, short or long rods, vibrios, spirilla and multicellular aggregates (Bazylinski et al., 1994; Rodgers et al., 1990) , have been found from world-wide diverse aquatic environments (including marine, river, pond, etc.), surface of marine sediments, and soil. The magnetotaxis of magnetotactic bacteria is based on specific intracellular magnetic structures, magnetosomes, which comprise nano-sized, membrane-bound crystals of magnetic iron minerals. Magnetosomes consist mainly of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) or greigite (Fe 3 S 4 ) (Bazylinski et al., 1988; Bazylinski and Garratt-Reed, 1993) . Additionally, FeS 2 and Fe 7 S 8 have also been reported recently (Mann et al., 1990; Farina et al., 1990) . Research on magnetotactic bacteria is of great significance, for example: as a model organism of biomagnetism to investigate the complex biomineralization in advanced organisms (Dunn, 1995) , as circumstantial evidence for ancient extraterrestrial life from a Martian meteorite (Kathie et al., 2002) . Research on magnetotactic bacteria is of significance for environmental markers (Lida and Akai, 1996) , for example, it has been widely concerned in geology, i.e., the contributions of magnetotactic bacteria to the stable remanence of sediments and to the magnetic susceptibility of Chinese loess-paleosol sequences (Kirschvink and Chang, 1984; Peng Xianzhi et al., 2002) . Additionally, research on the correlation between magnetotactic bacteria and iron in the environment is an issue involved in biogeochemistry, which is helpful to shed light on the mechanism of tolerance of some microbes and metal-tolerant plants to heavy-metal pollution (Yang Yuangen et al., 2004; Sadaf Naseem et al., 2005) . Besides the significant application of magnetotactic bacteria, magnetosomes also could widely be applied in many fields such as: material science, biology, pharmacy, electronics, optics, magnetism, and electrochemistry (Bazylinski, 2004) . Therefore, to establish an effective method to isolate magnetotactic bacteria is the crucial precondition for research on and application of them. Since the discovery of magnetotactic bacteria in 1975, magnetotactic bacteria differing in morphology have been isolated by the adscititious magnetic field based on their magnetotaxis from natural environment or www.gyig.ac.cn www.springerlink.com enriched samples. The methods of isolating magnetotactic bacteria could be roughly divided into two groups: (1) to isolate magnetotactic bacteria with motility and intracellular magnetosomes by the adscititious magnetic field, for example: magnetic collection and \"race track\" purification of magnetotactic bacteria (Moench and Konetzka, 1978; Wolfe et al., 1987) , or to design an apparatus to harvest magnetotactic bacteria (Ulysses et al., 2003; Wei Yangbao et al., 1994) ; and (2) to isolate non-motile and non-or weekly-magnetotactic bacteria as a result of environmental factors from enriched samples by colony formation, and optimization of conditions for growth and synthesis of magnetosomes (Sakaguchi et al., 1996) . A sulphate-reducing magnetic anaerobe, RS-1, which is weakly magnetotactic, was isolated by this method.",

This means that the phylogenetic origin of magnetotactic bacteria is of magnetotaxis which as a characteristic feature may has been multi-evolved. There is no genus particularity of magnetotaxis to bacteria. It is proven through the novel magnetotactic bacteria with phylogenetic diversity that the home-made apparatus could harvest and isolate novel magnetotactic bacteria efficiently.",

Through aerobical plate colony isolation, we obtained three strains of pure oxygen tolerant magnetotactic bacteria MG-1, MG-2, and MG-3. This apparatus has many unique advantages compared with the similar domestic and foreign apparatuses reported so far, for example: (1) low-cost, simple to assemble, and easy to implement; (2) the flask for enrichment directly links with the separating chamber of the apparatus, which significantly simplifies the working procedures; (3) the sampling chamber is filled with enrichment medium to balance the concentrations of solution in two chambers of the apparatus, so as to reduce the influence on the swimming of bacteria caused by molecule diffusion; (4) the enrichment medium in the sampling chamber could enrich a few harvested bacteria secondarily; (5) high efficiency as evidenced by the fact that we isolated three strains successfully after merely 3 hours of harvesting in this paper; (6) the isolated magnetotactic bacteria are of novelty on morphology and phylogenesis through comparing their phylogenetic relationship with other known magnetic strains. However, our apparatus has the deficiency that depends on the magnetotaxisto to retrieve a large number of magnetic bacteria. There are non-motile and non-or weekly-magnetotactic bacteria as a result of environmental factors in natural environments (Sakaguchi et al., 1996; Schuler and Frankel, 1999) . So it relies on the method that does not use magnetotaxis to retrieve magnetic bacteria (Sakaguchi et al., 1996) , which consists of several steps that include incubation of sediments, enrichment of bacteria in the medium and isolation by colony formation. Although our approach may not retrieve all possible forms of magnetotactic microorganisms, we believe that both methods are complementary and can be used in different situations or for different purposes, and it is proven to be easy to use and retrieve a large number of novel magnetotactic bacteria efficiently by our apparatus and method.",
