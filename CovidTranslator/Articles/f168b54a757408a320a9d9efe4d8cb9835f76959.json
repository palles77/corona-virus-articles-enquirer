Appr-1 0 -pase catalyzes the conversion of ADPribose-1 0 -monophosphate (Appr-1 0 -p) to ADP-ribose in the tRNA-splicing pathway.

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a contagious disease that infects avian species and causes tremendous losses in the poultry industry. Its aetiological agent, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), replicates not only in the epithelium of upper and lower respiratory tract tissues, but also in many tissues along the alimentary tract and elsewhere, e.g. kidney, oviduct and testes (Cavanagh, 2007) . Infectious bronchitis virus is a member of the genus Coronavirus which can be classified into three distinct groups (Spaan & Cavanagh, 2004) . IBV belongs to group III (Lai & Holmes, 2001) . SARS-Cov is also a member of the coronaviruses. In 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) struck China and quickly spread to the rest of the world, causing more than 8000 fatalities. Immediately, scientists initiated intensive studies on coronaviruses. Considering that the genomes encoding the nonstructural proteins (nsps) are conserved among SARS-Cov, IBV, human-Cov 229E etc., the study of IBV will facilitate the thorough understanding of coronaviruses.",

Its genome expression starts with the translation of two replicase ORFs (1a and 1b). The transcriptional replicase polyproteins are proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteinases to produce 15 nsps. These nsps are replicative enzymes required in RNA transcription and genome replication (Snijder et al., 2003; Prentice et al., 2004) . Nsp3 contains an ADRP (adenosine diphosphate-ribose-1 0 -phosphatase) domain, which is also known as the macro domain. Recent studies have revealed that the macro domain is an ADP-ribose-binding module and it is believed to have ADP-ribose-1 0 -monophosphatase (Appr-1 0 -pase) activity. Appr-1 0pase is involved in the tRNA-splicing pathway and catalyzes the conversion of ADP-ribose-1 0 -monophosphate (Appr-1 0 -p) to ADPribose, which can be recycled in nucleotide metabolism (Kumaran et al., 2004; Karras et al., 2005) .",

The gene encoding the IBV nsp3 # 2008 International Union of Crystallography All rights reserved ADRP domain (corresponding to Asp1024-Lys1178 of the ORF1a polyprotein) was inserted between the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-6p-1 plasmid. The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The cells were cultured in LB medium containing 0.1 mg ml \u00c01 ampicillin at 310 K. When the optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) reached 0.6, 0.3 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added and the cultures were induced at 289 K for 16 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1.8 mM KH 2 PO 4 pH 7.3) supplemented with 1 mM DTT and 0.1 mM PMSF. The cells were sonicated at 277 K and the lysate was centrifuged at 27 000g for 40 min at 277 K and the precipitate was discarded. The supernatant was loaded onto 2 ml GST-glutathione affinity columns (Pharmacia). The fusion protein was then cleaved on the column (oncolumn cleavage seems to be as effective as the orthodox approach) with GST-rhinovirus 3C protease at 277 K for 18 h, resulting in five additional residues (GPLGS) at the N-terminus. The cleavage buffer was PBS and the ratio of protease to substrate protein was 1:50.
