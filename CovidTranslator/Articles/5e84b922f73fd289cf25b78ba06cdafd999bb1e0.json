African swine fever virus (ASFV) infects cells of the monocytic/phagocytic system (Hess, 1981 ) causing some functional alterations (Martins et al., 1988) . The disease in domestic swine results in significant economic loss to the pig industry in endemic areas. Mortality in ASFVinfected pigs correlates with the virulence of the virus isolates (Pan and Hess, 1984) and occurs within 5-15 days of infection (Wardley et al., 1987) . Although ASFV induces a strong antibody response, the antibody has no neutralizing activity and virus clearance mediated by antibody-specific mechanisms does not occur until after the peak of viremia is over. Thus, antibody does not seem to play a major role in determining survival of pigs infected with ASFV (Wardley et al., 1987) . Specific immune mechanisms of ASFV clearance from infected pigs are poorly understood, hence, the prospects for development of vaccines are poor.",

We have reported changes in the expression of swine MHC or swine leukocyte antigens (SLA) in spleen tissue sections from animals infected with different isolates ofASFV (Gonzalez Juarrero et al., 1992 ) .

The total number of SLA Class I positive cells was not changed but rather the number of antigens per cell, as indicated by the mean channel intensity of fluorescence of the cell population, was increased with M-CSF, a change of 300 channels or more ( Fig. 2 (B) ) and without M-CSF, a change of 150 channels or more ( Fig. 2 (D) ). These increases in marker expression peaked at 3- 4 days of culture and thereafter decreased, in agreement with the results shown by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 ) . Changes in the expression of SLA Class II on macrophages during culture were reflected both in the percentage of cells that express Class II antigens as well as in the intensity of marker expression. Macrophages cultured without M-CSF increased from 40% (THI6, SLA-DQ) or 65% (40D, SLA-DR) Class II positive at 1 day of culture to 60% and 80% positive, respectively, at 3 or 4 days of culture with a mean fluorescence increase of approximately 100 channels for SLA-DR and 30 channels for SLA-DQ ( Fig. 2A,2B ) . These increases were reversed by 6 days of culture. When macrophages were cultured with M-CSF they exhibited a less pronounced increase in the percentage of SLA II positive cells, although these still peaked at 3-4 days of culture ( Fig. 2 (C) ). The relative intensity of SLA Class II expression was changed little in macrophages cultured with M-CSF, although the remaining Class II positive cells may be slightly brighter for SLA Class II expression at 6 days of culture (Fig.  2 (D) ). Incubation with LPS endotoxin caused no such increase in SLA I or II expression (data not shown). Overall, the changes in SLA Class II expression varied significantly between experiments. Thus, macrophages harvested after 1 day of culture ranged from 30 to 75% positive for SLA Class II expression, however, the maximum percentage of Class II positive cells invariably occurred at 3-4 days of culture with or without M-CSF.

Since the infected cells expressed less macrophage antigen at 8 h post-infection there could have been a general decrease in expression of surface antigens: to assess this, the relative intensity of the two markers, i.e. macrophage antigen and SLA, were compared as a ratio of the mean channel of fluorescence intensity of SLA relative to 74-22-15. The ratio calculations indicated that SLA Class I expression was reduced in macrophages infected for 8 h with the L60 or NHV ASFV isolates relative to the same macrophages cultured in medium alone (Table 2 ) .

The up-regulation, which is maximal at 3 to 4 days of culture for SLA Class I and Class II, is found for the total, immunoblotted SLA as well as for the antigens expressed on the cell surface. Fluorescence analyses verified that there is a major upward shift in the number of SLA Class I molecules on each macrophage whereas for SLA Class II there is both a novel expression of SLA Class II and an upward shift in the number of molecules per cell, which is greatest on macrophages cultured without M-CSF. By 6 days of culture these increases are reversed. These results indicate that 3-day-old macrophage cultures should be suitable stimulators of immune responses and the best targets for SLAmediated cytolytic activities.",

In cultures with M-CSF, cell proliferation declined by 6-8 days of culture and the expression of SLA Class I and Class II declined at 6 and 15 days of culture, respectively. The expression of MHC Class II antigens on monocytes and tissue macrophages from other animal species such as murine and human, also decreased after prolonged culture (Gonwa and Stobo, 1984; Toews et al., 1984) .",

            "text": "After infection with NHV and L60 ASFV isolates macrophages exhibited decreased Class I antigen expression at 8 or 12 h post-infection; in contrast, an increase of SLA Class I was seen on cells infected with ASFV DR-II. Interestingly, these changes in SLA Class I expression do not seem to correlate with the virulence of ASFV isolates (Pan and Hess, 1984) . The general losses in 74-22-15, SLA Class I and Class II could be attributed to virus mediated membrane turnover as virus infects the cells and moves to the replication centers in the cytoplasm. However, this would not explain the increase in SLA Class I expression on DR-II-infected macrophages. This isolate may express a unique function, possibly associated with other moderately virulent ASFV isolates, in that it causes up-regulation of SLA Class I expression similar to that observed after infection with radiation-leukemia virus, adenovirus 12, or coronavirus (Brown et al., 1988 ) . The fact that the non-virulent NHV isolate does not also stimulate SLA I expression may be due to the NHV isolate being related to the virulent L60 isolate or to it requiring other cells, e.g. Tcells, to secrete factors to influence macrophage antigen expression. The apparent recovery of some SLA antigen expression at 12 h post-infection may be due to a concomitant decrease in viral protein synthesis which in Vero cells is maximal at 8 h post-infection (Tabares et al., 1980) . The decrease in SLA Class I surface expression found in macrophages infected with ASFV NHV or L60 was not detectable when total extracts of these macrophages were analyzed by immunoblot analyses. This may indicate that the relative loss of surface SLA is small compared to the total cell associated SLA and therefore not detectable by the assay system. It is more likely that the deficit in surface SLA expression is due to a reduction in the cycling of the antigens back to the cell surface. This is supported in part by an electron microscopic examination of macrophages which reveals that SLA Class I and Class II molecules are associated with internal ASF viral particles detected by mAb and immunogold staining (M. Gonzalez Juarrero et al., unpublished data, 1988 ) . As these viral particles bud from the macrophage surface at later times in the infection, they may carry these SLA proteins in the viral envelope, similar to the earlier report of ASFV budding from Vero cells (Carrascosa et al., 1985) . A decrease in expression of SLA Class II may lead to a decrease in antigen presentation, a mechanism favorable for survival of the virus.",
