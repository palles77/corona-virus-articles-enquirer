The large E2 protein protrudes as club-shaped projections from the virus surface and contains the neutralizing antigenic determinants (Garwes et al,, 1978/79; Hu et al., 1985) . The E1 glycoprotein is more deeply embedded in the lipid envelope and is the predominant surface protein of coronaviruses including TGEV (Sturman et al., 1980; Wesley and Woods, 1986) . Competitive inhibition studies with monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) have revealed one dominant neutralizing site, Site A, on TGEV whereas neutralizing Mabs against one or more non-site A domains occur at lower frequencies (Jimenez et al., 1986; Delmas et al., 1986; Correa et al., 1988) . Woods et al. (1988) have shown that anti-E1 Mabs neutralize TGEV in the presence of guinea pig, rabbit and swine complement (C').",

For each experiment, 3 random aliquots of challenge virus were thawed, mixed and diluted 10-fold in PBS. The virus was then sonicated in two 20-s bursts in order to disrupt virus aggregates. The sonicated virus was further diluted in F-15 media (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum to a final dilution of either 10 -'~ or 10 -4. The diluted virus (5 ml) was incubated (1 h at 37\u00b0C) with an equal volume of colostrum, hyperimmune antiserum or Mab either with or without 3% guinea pig serum as a source of 5.5 units of C'.

To determine the in vivo protective capacity of the complementdependent mechanism of neutralization, Mab 1A6 was tested in piglets in different ways (Table 2 ). One group of pigs was challenged with virus incubated with Mab 1A6 alone and a second group challenged with virus treated with Mab 1A6 plus 5.5 units of complement (1A6 + C' ). The third group likewise received Mab 1A6 and 5.5 units of C' -treated virus and 2.9 ml of Mab 1A6 was fed 3 times per day for the duration of the experiment. The piglets receiving Mab 1A6-treated inoculum, either with or without C', were fully susceptible to infection even though no virus was detected in the Mab 1A6 + C' inoculum. Thus, even though tissue culture assays show virus neutralization by Mab 1A6 + C', piglets remained fully susceptible to this challenge, indicating that the 1A6 + C' does not irreversibly neutralize all of the virulent virus. E2-specific neutralizing Mab 5D5 was used alone (Group IV), or Mab 4F6 was used in combination with complement-dependent anti-E1 Mab 1A6 (Group V) to inactivate virus prior to challenge (Table 2) . Although Mabs 4F6, 5D5 and (1A6+C') completely neutralized the inoculum in vitro, acute clinical signs of diarrhea, dehydration and depression developed in pigs receiving the Mab-treated virus. In the Mab 5D5 group, 2 of the 3 pigs survived challenge at 50 LDso, showing marked clinical signs of emaciation and dehydration, but no Mab 5D5-treated pigs survived the 500 LD~o challenge dose.",

The El-matrix glycoprotein is more abundant than the E2 glycoprotein in the virus envelope and El-specific Mabs, 1A6, 4Bll, 4G8 and 4F2, exhibit complement-dependent virus neutralization with VN titers that exceed those commonly associated with protective hyperimmune sera and E2-specific Mabs (Woods et al., 1987) . We have tested our most potent neutralizing E2 Mabs and E1 Mab in the presence of C', to determine their capacity to passively protect piglets. The pigs were inoculated with virus treated with El-specific Mab 1A6 and 5.5 units of C' or with an E2-specific Mab and additional Mab was fed in fl-propiolactone-treated milk 3 times daily for the 10-day observation period. These studies have shown that the Mab + C' mixture which neutralizes TGEV in vitro did not protect baby pigs. In addition, neither the Elspecific Mab+C' mixture supplemented with E2-specific neutralizing Mab nor the E2-specific neutralizing Mab alone were protective for piglets, therefore, efficient virus neutralization in vitro does not correlate with the ability to protect piglets from TGEV challenge.

            "text": "Protection against TGE mortality in piglets is a result of neutralization of virus by antibody in the lumen of the alimentary tract (Haelterman, 1963) . This is accomplished naturally by continuous immunoglobulin intake from the colostrum and milk of an immune sow. Piglets deprived of this immunoglobulin source are susceptible to experimental infection within 4 h after removal from the sow (Haelterman, 1963) . Colostral IgG and sIgA from immune sows passively protect piglets (Abou-Youssef and Ristic, 1975; Bohl and Saif, 1975; Stone et al., 1977) although sIgA is superior because it persists in high titer in the post-colostral milk (Porter and Allen, 1972 ) . Haelterman (1963) has shown that the antiserum from sows exposed to virulent TGEV also is sufficient to passively protect piglets and, in fact, one report suggests that antiserum administered to piglets with clinical signs of TGE altered the outcome of the disease (Noble, 1964) . Therefore, if the antiserum or colostrum from an immune sow is fed regularly to piglets, then critical protective epitopes on virulent TGEV are neutralized in the lumen of the alimentary tract. We have repeated these results with CDCD piglets in isolation chambers fed 20-ml aliquots of colostrum per feeding or 4 ml of antiserum per feed. Three daily feedings protected the pigs if the challenge virus was first incubated (37 \u00b0 C, 1 h) with antibody. Polyclonal serum completely blocked infection with TGEV because piglets fed hyperimmune antiserum and challenge virus were fully susceptible at 2 weeks of age when housed with convalescing pigs that were shedding TGEV. Since antibody against critical protective epitopes is present in immune colostrum and antiserum, then the appropriate Mab or combination of Mabs showing parallel degrees of passive protection would identify these critical epitopes.",

E2-specific Mab 5D5 may have reduced mortality at the lower challenge dose (Table 2 ), but did not diminish observable clinical signs. One explanation for the lack of passive protection with murine Mabs may be that the virus-antibody complex dissociates after passing through the stomach of piglets and liberates infectious virus. However, porcine polyclonal antibodies in colostrum and in hyperimmune antiserum apparently do not dissociate because they are effective in inactivating TGEV and protecting piglets (Haelterman, 1963; Stone et al., 1977) . These results suggest that perhaps the antigenic avidity of the murine Mabs used in this study was inadequate to survive passage through the piglet's digestive tract, whereas the avidity of the pig polyclonal antibody was sufficient.",

To limit the effect of virus variants that might escape neutralization, a minimal challenge dose, 50 or 500 LDso, was used. No virus escape was detected by plaque assay after in vitro incubation of the challenge inoculum + Mab nor was there any significant difference in the onset of clinical disease for experimental piglets in which the inoculum was incubated with a Mab, and for control piglets. Additionally, in an attempt to minimize the effect of virus aggregation, the challenge virus was sonicated before in vitro incubation to expose all infectious particles to Mab.",
