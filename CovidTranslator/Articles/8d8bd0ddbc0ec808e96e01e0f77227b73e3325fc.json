            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and has the potential to threaten global public health and socioeconomic stability. Evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV infection in vitro and in non-human primates clouds the prospects for a safe vaccine. Using antibodies from SARS patients, we identified and characterized SARS-CoV B-cell peptide epitopes with disparate functions. In rhesus macaques, the spike glycoprotein peptides S 471\u2212503 , S 604\u2212625 , and S 1164\u22121191 elicited antibodies that efficiently prevented infection in non-human primates. In contrast, peptide S 597\u2212603 induced antibodies that enhanced infection both in vitro and in non-human primates by using an epitope sequence-dependent (ESD) mechanism. This peptide exhibited a high level of serological reactivity (64%), which resulted from the additive responses of two tandem epitopes (S 597\u2212603 and S 604\u2212625 ) and a long-term human B-cell memory response with antisera from convalescent SARS patients. Thus, peptide-based vaccines against SARS-CoV could be engineered to avoid ADE via elimination of the S 597\u2212603 epitope. We provide herein an alternative strategy to prepare a safe and effective vaccine for ADE of viral infection by identifying and eliminating epitope sequence-dependent enhancement of viral infection.",

            "text": "A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was characterized in March 2003 after a global effort following the first epidemiological case in November 2002. 1 Ten years later (2012), a novel Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus emerged, which was a \u03b2coronavirus, similar to SARS-CoV. 2 SARS is a deadly infectious disease and has the potential to seriously threaten public health and socioeconomic stability worldwide. 1 Serologic and genetic investigations indicate that SARS-CoV is of zoonotic origin, 3, 4 with bats as the likely animal reservoir. Since the identification of SARS-CoV in 2003, there have been major advances in understanding SARS-CoV genetics 1, 5, 6 and molecular epidemi-ology 7 and in identification of host receptors 8, 9 and T-cell epitopes. 10, 11 Models in mice, ferrets, and monkeys have been established, each with particular strengths and weaknesses. 12 Vaccine candidates have included DNA, a live attenuated strain, recombinant proteins, inactivated whole virions, and vector vaccines; 13 however, none have been approved through clinical investigation. 14 Safety concerns about a SARS-CoV vaccine have been raised, given the observation in vitro of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV infection that could, in theory, exacerbate disease. 15 Other observations include evidence of ADE reported here for the first time induced by an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine in rhesus macaques ( Figure 1 ) and by antisera from SARS patients (Table S1) , as well as ADE in other coronavirus infections. 16\u221218 ADE in vitro has been observed for many other viruses, including yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza A virus. 19 \u221221 HIV-induced ADE has been described, 22, 23 but the exact mechanism is still uncertain. 24 Among other examples of ADE, secondary infection with dengue virus of a heterologous serotype has been associated with an immunopathologic vascular leakage and hemorrhagic syndrome, Dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/ DSS). 25 Most descriptions of ADE relate to Fc-gamma receptor (Fc\u03b3R) and/or complement components promoting viral uptake and virus replication pathways. 26\u221228 Goncalvez et al. reported that treatment of juvenile rhesus monkeys with the cross-reactive mAb 1A5, which recognizes the fusion loop in DII of Dengue virus, enhanced DV4 viremia by several logs within 3\u22126 days of infection. 26 Furthermore, a 9-amino acid (aa) deletion at the Nterminus of the CH 2 domain in the Fc region abrogated enhancement in vitro and in vivo, confirming that ADE occurred through an Fc\u03b3R pathway for this class of antibodies. Another study analyzed the stoichiometric relationship between antibodymediated neutralization and enhancement of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in cells expressing Fc\u03b3R. 29 The results showed that there is an antibody occupancy threshold on the virion for neutralization or enhancement of virus infection. Strongly neutralizing DIII-lateral ridge-specific mAbs inhibit at lower occupancy, whereas weakly neutralizing mAbs that bind distinct epitopes require a much higher mAb occupancy for neutralization. When mAb occupancy falls below the threshold for neutralization, ADE can occur. In subsequent studies, the same group showed that the level of antibody occupancy that promotes ADE in vivo is also modulated by the binding of C1q, which restricts ADE in an IgG subclass-specific manner. 30 On the basis of these studies, many neutralizing antibodies may enhance infection in vitro in Fc\u03b3R + cells when their concentrations fall below a key occupancy threshold, and some Abs that poorly neutralize may strongly enhance over a wide dose\u2212response range. However, for antibody isotypes that bind C1q avidly, much of the enhancing effect may be minimized in vivo.",

Huang et al. 31 demonstrated ADE in vitro of an anti-prM mAb against DENV in cell lines that lacked expression of Fc\u03b3R (e.g., baby hamster kidney cell line BHK-21 and murine fibroblast cell lineNIH3T3). Importantly, a peptide in the M3 region (CPFLKQNEPEDIDCW) of prM blocked this ADE in a dosedependent manner. The antibody appeared to have dual specificity and bound to Dengue virus virions and/or a crossreactive HSP60 protein on the cell surface. Thus, ADE via non-Fc\u03b3R-or complement-dependent mechanisms is plausible for DENV, yet poorly characterized in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we discovered that a peptide of the viral sequence simultaneously elicits the antibodies of disparate functions in protection and enhancement against SARS-CoV infection by the studies with host Vero E6 cells in vitro and in non-human primates.",

            "text": "Identification of Highly Immunodominant B-Cell Peptides of SARS-CoV in Humans. Mapping highly immunoreactive human B-cell peptides by employing SARS patient antisera was carried out by a number of research groups. Consistent with previous reports, Jiang's laboratory reported that the M1\u2212131 and M132\u2212162 peptides 32 from the membrane protein and the N153\u2212178 and N362\u2212412 peptides from the N protein 33 were highly reactive with all convalescent-phase test sera from SARS patients. The laboratories of Wu and Che collaboratively identified three conformational (amino acids 1\u2212 69, 68\u2212213, and 337\u2212422) and three linear (amino acids 1\u221269, 121\u2212213, and 337\u2212422) epitopes on the full-length N protein that were immunodominant. 34 Using a \"split and mix\" combinatorial strategy, we synthesized an overlapping peptide library spanning all four structural proteins of the SARS-CoV BJ01 strain, including the envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S). We screened this peptide library with antisera from convalescent SARS patients and identified dominant peptide epitopes recognized by anti-SARS IgG. 35 Further experiments in this paper indicate that three peptides in the S protein (S 471\u2212503 , S 604\u2212625 , and S 1164\u22121191 ) were strongly bound by SARS-CoV-specific human IgG from 12.8, 32.6, and 13.9%, respectively, of the 470 SARS patients ( Table  1) . Extension of the peptides (Table S2 ) to further characterize the epitopes' N-and C-termini identified a new immunodominant peptide (S 597\u2212625 ), which was recognized by antisera from 64% of the patients ( Table 1 ). The S 597\u2212625 peptide specifically reduced the titer of human IgG in convalescent sera from SARS patients who reacted with SARS-CoV viral lysates ( Figure 2A ). We studied sequentially collected sera from 21 convalescent SARS patients whose sera (obtained 3 months after onset of infection) strongly reacted with the S 597\u2212625 peptide. The antisera from these patients continued to recognize the S 597\u2212625 at 12 months [12/21 (57.1%)], 18 months [7/21 (33.3%)], and 24 months [6/21 (28.6%)] after the onset of SARS ( Figure 2B ), implying that the S 597\u2212625 peptide is a major immunodominant peptide in humans and elicits a long-term B-cell memory response after natural infection with SARS-CoV.",

Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the S 597\u2212604 peptide demonstrated that L597, Y598, Q599, D600, and C603 are critical amino acid residues for interaction with mAb43-3-14 ( Figure 4E ; Table S4 ). The S 597\u2212603 peptide lies close to the C-terminus of the SARS-CoV major receptor (ACE2)-binding domain (RBD). 8 We speculate that mAb43-3-14 may expose specific conformations that catalyze SARS-CoV attachment to and/or membrane fusion with target cells.",

The immunization protocol included one priming injection followed by three boosts at 2-week intervals (Chart S1). Antipeptide polyclonal Abs (monkey IgG) monitored by ELISA showed high-level responses to all immunized peptides after three boosts ( Figure 6 , left). Antibodies ( Figure 6A ) against the four peptides in sera from Vac1-immunized animals were at background level on all blood collection days. Vac2 gradually induced anti-S 597\u2212625 peptide antibodies after three boosts. Not surprisingly, both Vac2 and Vac4 immunizations elicited high levels of IgG against the S 604\u2212625 peptide because the vaccine components consisted of the S 597\u2212625 or S 604\u2212625 epitopes in these two animal groups. Anti-S 604\u2212625 and -S 1164\u22121191 antibodies in the Vac3-immunized animal group reached their highest levels before the second boost (28 days after the first injection). The average titer of anti-S 604\u2212625 IgG was greater than 1:10 6 in Vac3-immunized monkeys before SARS-CoV challenge and was 3-or 2-fold times that of Vac2 or Vac4, respectively. Interestingly, when Vac3-vaccinated animals were challenged by SARS-CoV, the IgG level against S 604\u2212625 gradually decreased ( Figure 6B ) on days 2 and 6 postinfection. This is different from the Vac2 and Vac4 immunizations, after which IgG levels inexplicably increased on day 2 postinfection and subsequently decreased on day 6 postinfection. This observation implies that anti-S 604\u2212625 antibodies are strongly involved in the neutralization of SARS-CoV in monkeys and that the existing S 597\u2212603 epitope (in Vac2 and Vac4) may reduce the total titer of anti-S 604\u2212625 antibodies.",

The mechanism by which anti-S 1164\u22121191 antibodies reduce the efficiency of SARS-CoV fusion is likely to be associated with an exposed five-turn \u03b1helix conformation via HR2 binding to HR1 and an extended conformation formed by residues 1160\u22121177 and 1178\u22121184 of three antiparallel HR2 helices in an oblique orientation surrounding a parallel, trimeric coiled-coil of three HR1 helices. 41 Binding of mAb581-39 to the SARS-CoV virion was the strongest among the mAbs ( Figure 3A ), which implies that S 1164\u22121191 peptide may act as a major immunoantigen.",

Using an HL-CZ human promonocyte cell line, Chen and Huang found that higher concentrations of antisera collected from SARS-CoV-infected patients facilitated SARS-CoV infection and induced higher levels of virus-induced apoptosis. They further demonstrated that this phenomenon occurred via antispike protein antibodies that mediated ADE, but not via anti-N protein antibodies. 42 Bruzzone and Jaume's laboratory showed that antispike immune serum increased infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages by replication-competent SARS-CoV as well as by spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (SARS-CoVpp), although they did not clarify whether this enhancement was through the Fc\u03b3RII pathway. 43 Reaction a a B-cell epitopes with a free \u2212SH sequence (containing a Cys residue) were prepared directly. B-cell epitopes without a free \u2212SH group were anchored by an additional cysteine residue at the C-terminal ( Figure S2) . A four-branched, brominated, multiple-antigen core peptide (BrK 2 KA, Figure S3 ) via lysine two \u03b1-amino and side-chain amino groups was prepared that finally conjugated with four copies of individual antigenic peptide. lentiviral particles, as well as by replication-competent SARS coronavirus. Jaume and collaborators proposed that ADE of SARS-CoV utilizes a novel cell entry mechanism into immune cells. 44 This study demonstrates for the first time that an antibody (mAb43-3-14) targeting a specific linear epitope (S 597\u2212603 ) of the SARS-CoV spike protein can mediate enhancement of virus infection both in vitro and in non-human primates via an epitope sequence-dependent mechanism. We also demonstrate that the viral peptides that induce protection from pathogenesis can be identified and distinguished from those inducing enhancement in primates. These findings reveal a new mechanism of virus evasion of host defense that potentially provides an alternative strategy to prepare safe and effective vaccines against ADE of virus infections.",

A dose of 0.2 or 1.8 mg/kg of the antibody given by intravenous (iv) injection was used to treat the different groups. The same volume of 0.9% NaCl was used for the control group. The procedures were approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Peking Union Medical College (Animal Welfare Assurance No. A5655-01, IACUC approval date September 24, 2007).",
