            "text": "We have developed a generalizable 'smart molecular diagnostic' capable of accurate point-ofcare (POC) detection of variable nucleic acid targets. Our one-pot isothermal assay relies on multiplex execution of four loop-mediated isothermal amplification reactions, with primers that are degenerate and redundant, thereby increasing the breadth of targets while reducing the probability of amplification failure. An easy-to-read visual answer is computed directly by a multi-input Boolean OR gate signal transducer that uses degenerate strand exchange probes to assess any combination of amplicons. We demonstrate our platform by using the same assay to detect divergent Asian and African lineages of the evolving Zika virus (ZIKV), while maintaining selectivity against non-target viruses. Direct analysis of biological specimens proved possible, with 20 virions / \u00b5l being directly detected in human saliva within 90 minutes, and crudely macerated ZIKV-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes being identified with 100% specificity and sensitivity.",

Familiar examples include electrochemical sensors for glucose, 1 or rapid immunoassays for metabolites such as human chorionic gonadotropin (the canonical pregnancy test), 2 and pathogens, either directly (influenza viruses) or via immune responses (antibodies against HIV-1/2). 3 The range of conditions and pathogens that could be tested for could likely be greatly expanded by developing POC diagnostics for nucleic acids 3 that would have greater sensitivity and accuracy. However, the current gold standard for molecular diagnostics, the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), requires significant technical expertise and expensive and cumbersome equipment. Even portable instruments, such the Cepheid GeneXpert Omni, cost several thousand dollars and rely on expensive qPCR cartridge consumables for individual tests.",

            "text": "In contrast, isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests (iNAATs) have been developed that rival PCR in sensitivity, cost far less, and do not necessarily rely on complex instrumentation. 4 To further the adoption of these assays, we and others have begun to develop 'smart molecular diagnostics' that can integrate information at the molecular level. For example, to increase signal specificity, a variety of sequence-specific probes, including molecular beacons, nucleasedependent probes, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pairs have been adapted to isothermal amplification assays such as rolling circle amplification (RCA), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), or loop-mediated amplification (LAMP). 5, 6, 7 More recently, RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes, such as Cas13a and Cas12a, have been used to signal the presence of isothermally generated amplicons. 8, 9 In our own previous work, we developed oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes, 10 that were triggered by strand exchange reactions with transiently single-stranded stem-loop sequences. 11 This led to the exquisitely sensitive detection of LAMP amplicons without interference. 12 One-pot LAMP-OSD assays that can work with crude samples are especially appealing for POC use. 13, 14 These assays have been coupled to highly sensitive and reliable 'yes/no' output signals such as fluorescence, glucose, or hCG that can be readily read using offthe-shelf cellphones, glucometers, or pregnancy test strips, respectively. 12, 13, 15 16, 17, 18, 19 Toehold switch RNA sensors have also been used to link iNAATs with in vitro reporter protein translation, leading to colorimetric signals. 20 Even as these iNAAT tests move towards wider adoption, they all still face the same problem as other POC assays, in that the answers they give are relatively simplistic. However, given that the strand exchange reactions that underlie OSD probes were originally derived from far more complex DNA computations, 10, 21, 22, 23 it may be possible to go beyond mere improvements in specificity and to integrate additional desirable features directly into the molecular diagnostic itself, such that the reaction helps to 'compute' its own outcome. As examples, we have previously developed strand exchange computation modules that can quantitate inputs to isothermal amplification reactions, 24 or that can integrate multiple molecular signals via Boolean logic operations. 17 We now attempt to take on real-world problems with computations that are embedded in the smart molecular diagnostics themselves. It is unfortunately a fundamental fact that diagnostic targets often evolve faster than assays designed to detect them. The resulting target sequence variations can easily prevent recognition of assay primers and probes, leading to test failure and false negative readouts, a problem which to date can only be solved via regular (and impractical) assay updates. 25, 26 For instance, primers and probes for all eight published reverse transcription (RT) qPCR assays (qRT-PCR) for Zika virus (ZIKV) were found to have numerous mismatches with multiple ZIKV genomes sequenced from recent outbreaks. 27 Some 20%-80% of ZIKV-infected patients are believed to have remained undiagnosed due to this incompatibility. 27, 28 To overcome this problem and increase the overall accuracy of POC nucleic acid testing we have engineered additional computations into our smart molecular diagnostics that can compute the presence of almost any ZIKV variant. Strategic degenerate bases in 21 multiplexed primers allow the amplification of multiple ZIKV viral genes and gene variants in four, simultaneous LAMP reactions. The presence of any positive signal is calculated by multi-input Boolean 'OR'gated logic processors in a single one-pot reaction that directly analyzes crude biological samples and provides a visual yes/no readout for any ZIKV variant within 60-90 min. As with previous LAMP-OSD assays, the exquisite sequence-specificity of oligonucleotide strand exchange probes ensures signal specificity, while the built-in assay redundancy of the molecular logic processors guards against false negatives.",

ZIKV clusters into two African lineages and one Asian lineage that includes the current epidemic strains. 29 The Asian and African lineages of ZIKV show 0.2% to 10.6% intra-lineage and 4.5% to 12.1% inter-lineage nucleotide variation. 29 The epidemic strains have accumulated additional changes and have potentially undergone multiple natural recombinations. 29, 30 The strains are likely continuing to evolve, presenting a challenging target for surveillance and diagnostics. Here, we designed four reverse transcription (RT) LAMP assays to amplify relatively conserved regions in four ZIKV genes -capsid (CA), NS1, NS3, and NS5. Each individual assay included two inner primers (FIP and BIP), two outer primers (B3 and F3), and one loop primer (LP). The CA LAMP assay utilized an additional sixth primer, termed stem primer 31 (SP), complementary to the target region between F1 and B1 priming sites ( Figure 1A) . Specific nucleotide positions within these primers were substituted with degenerate nucleobases to allow pairing with variant ZIKV RNA (Supplementary Table  T1 ). The NS3 LAMP primer set had the lowest degeneracy with only 10 positions varying between two nucleobases and one position varying between three nucleobases. Twelve positions in the NS1 LAMP primer set varied between two nucleobases. The CA LAMP primers had a slightly higher degeneracy with 13 polymorphic positions varying between two bases. The NS5 primer set was the most degenerate with 15, 6, and 1 positions varying between two, three, or four bases, respectively.",

Unlike four individual OSDs that required a combination of 8 fluorophore or quencher-labeled oligonucleotides, the three-way junction 4GO probe would need a single fluorophore-quencher pair (Figure 1 ).

Oligonucleotides S1 -S4, designed based on validated degenerate OSD sequences, served as strand exchange probes for NS1, NS5, CA, and NS3 amplicons, respectively. The S5 strand acted as a scaffold for 4GO probe assembly ( Figure 1D) . Domain c at the 5'-end of S5 was complementary to domain c' in S1, while, domain f at the 3'-end of S5 was complementary to domain f' of the S4 strand. The intervening region of S5 contained two short target-independent sequences -domain d complementary to domain d' at the fluorophore-labeled 5'-end of S2 and domain e complementary to domain e' at the quencher-labeled 3'-end of S3. Concomitant hybridization of S2 and S3 to S5 would juxtapose the fluorophore and quencher leading to loss of signal. However, at temperatures \u2265 20 \u00b0C, pairing of S2 and S5 was contingent upon formation of a three-way junction with S1 via interactions between complementary S2 domain a' with S1 domain a and S5 domain c with S1 domain c'. Similarly, stable interaction of S3 and S5 was dependent upon a three-way hybridization with S4. As a result, strand exchange between the 4GO probe and any one or more of the ZIKV amplicons would separate the fluorophore-bearing S2 from quencher-labeled S3. For example, the NS5 LAMP amplicon loop would directly remove S2 from the 4GO probe. Meanwhile, by binding S1, the NS1 amplicons would destroy the three-way junction between S1, S2, and S5. Consequently, the 4GO probe would transduce the presence of one or any combination of the four ZIKV amplicons into a single-channel endpoint fluorescence that could be easily read at ambient temperature.",

Following LAMP amplification, 4GO probe fluorescence was found to be elevated in all reactions containing even a few hundred copies of at least one of the ZIKV templates (Figures 5A-E) .

Short single-stranded toeholds at the 3'-and 5'-ends of S I and S II , respectively could independently initiate strand exchange with their cognate target sequences resulting in separation of the fluorophore from the quencher and a concomitant rise in signal. For instance, the CAN3.2GO probe fluorescence would increase if it underwent strand exchange with either CA or N3 amplicons. Similarly, the N1N5.2GO probe would signal if either or both NS1 and NS5 amplicons were present.",

The fact that multiple, different amplification reactions can be carried out in parallel, and yet the user need only attend to the final, fluorescent signal highlights the power of the diagnostic, and presages the possibility of even more complex integration of molecular signals.

As few as 190 copies of ZIKV RNA could be readily identified using 4-Plex-LAMP-2GO assays without any false positive reactions. Similarly, both single and multiplex LAMPbased assays could identify 2 x 10 4 /ml ZIKV virions spiked in human saliva within 90 min. These assays were equally adept at identifying both Asian and African lineages of ZIKV without cross-reaction with related or co-circulating viruses. The assay thus finds itself in a relatively rarified set of molecular diagnostics that are truly capable of performing in demanding field conditions. For instance, RPA has demonstrated near 100% sensitivity and specificity in field tests for detection of many viruses, bacteria, and parasites. 44, 45, 46 Similarly, the isothermal nicking enzyme amplification reaction (NEAR) automated on the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-waived portable device Alere i (Alere, Scarborough, MA) is being used for POC diagnosis of infectious agents such as influenza viruses. 47 Overall, though, our envisioned smart molecular diagnostics platform has much greater versatility for field use going forward. For instance, most field applications of RPA involve purification of nucleic acid analytes from clinical specimens. In contrast, our one-pot reactions can directly analyze crude biospecimens without necessitating complicated sample preparation and nucleic acid purification.

            "text": "In conclusion, our smart molecular diagnostic overcomes the principal challenges faced by most iNAATs -non-specific amplification, false negatives, and false positives -while maintaining an easy-to-use user-interface. This assay platform should be of greatest utility for the development of disposable point-of-care devices. Despite performing multi-component analytical operations, the molecular computations are hidden from the user in a one-pot reaction that can both directly receive the sample and emanate visual results. We have previously demonstrated that the ready-to-use LAMP-OSD assay mixes can be lyophilized and stored for extended durations without loss of activity. 13 These various features should minimize device intricacies, and in turn reduce cost, especially since only two protein enzymes and a single fluorophore-quencher pair are required. Most importantly, the molecular probes can be configured to capture both current and future fast-evolving targets, such as the Zika viruses, with both greater breadth and greater accuracy than existing tests.",

The Primer Explorer v5 LAMP primer design software (Eiken Chemical Co., Japan) was used for generating LAMP primer sets composed of the outer primers F3 and B3 and the inner primers FIP and BIP. Primer design was constrained to include at least a 40 base pair (bp) gap between the F1 and F2 as well as between the B1 and B2 priming sites. Loop primers and stem primers were manually designed. Primer specificity for ZIKV isolates and a corresponding lack of significant cross-reactivity to other nucleic acids of human or pathogenic origin was further assessed using NCBI BLAST. 54, 55 Polymorphic loci in the primers were substituted with degenerate bases although, some polymorphisms near the 5'end of F3 or B3 or near the middle of FIP or BIP were ignored to reduce the degeneracy burden and to ensure efficient amplification. 15 Our previous work had shown that such mismatches minimally disrupted LAMP primer efficiency. 15 The nucleic acid circuit design software NUPACK 56 was used to design four OSD probes, each specific to one of the four ZIKV amplicons, according to our previously published design rules. 12 Unique, fluorophore-labeled OSD strands were designed to bind between B1 and B2 sequences of NS5 and NS3 amplicons and between F1 and F2 sequences of NS1 and capsid amplicons. The quencher-labeled OSD strands were designed to be partially complementary to the fluorophore-labeled strand. Single-stranded toeholds at the 3'-end or 5'-end of fluorophorelabeled strands were designed to be 10 or 13 nucleotides long. All 3'-OH ends were blocked with inverted deoxythymidine (dT) to prevent extension by DNA polymerase. Polymorphic loci in all four OSD probes were substituted with appropriate degenerate bases. These degenerate OSD probe strands were then used as a basis for designing the two-input 2GO and four-input .

Annealing was performed by denaturing the oligonucleotide mix at 95 \u00b0C for 1 min followed by slow cooling at the rate of 0.1 \u00b0C/s to 25 \u00b0C. Excess annealed probe was stored at -20 \u00b0C.The CAN3.2GO probe was assembled by annealing 4 \u00b5M of CAN3.2GO.Gate oligonucleotide with 6 \u00b5M of the quencher-labeled CAN3.2GO.Q oligonucleotide and 2 \u00b5M of the fluorophorelabeled CAN3.2GO.FAM oligonucleotide. Similarly, the N1N5.2GO probe was assembled by annealing 6 \u00b5M of N5N1.2GO.Gate oligonucleotide with 8 \u00b5M of the quencher-labeled N5N1.2GO.Q oligonucleotide and 2 \u00b5M of the fluorophore-labeled N5N1.2GO.FAM oligonucleotide. The three oligonucleotide components of each 2GO probe were mixed in 1X Isothermal buffer supplemented with 8 mM MgSO 4 and incubated for 1 min at 95 \u00baC. The mixture was then slowly cooled at the rate of 0.1 \u00b0C/s to 25 \u00b0C. Excess annealed 2GO probes were stored at -20 \u00b0C.The 4GO probe was assembled by annealing 4 \u00b5M of the 4GO.S1 strand, 1 \u00b5M of the fluorophore-labeled 4GO.S2 strand, 4 \u00b5M of the quencher-labeled 4GO.S3 strand, 4 \u00b5M of the 4GO.S4 strand, and 3 \u00b5M of the 4GO.S5 strand. All oligonucleotides were mixed in 1X Isothermal buffer supplemented with 8 mM MgSO 4 and incubated for 1 min at 95 \u00baC.

Excess annealed 4GO probes were stored at -20 \u00b0C.One-pot RT-LAMP assayAll one-pot RT-LAMP assays were assembled in 25 \u00b5L reactions containing 1X Isothermal buffer supplemented with 1.4 mM deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs), 0.4 M betaine, 6 mM additional MgSO 4 , 16 units of Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase (NEB), and 7.5 units of warmstart RTx reverse transcriptase (NEB). Primer-containing singleplex reactions were appended with 2.4 \u00b5M each of a single type of FIP and BIP primer, 1.2 \u00b5M of the corresponding loop primer, 1.2 \u00b5M of the corresponding stem primer (only for the capsid assay), and 0.6 \u00b5M each of the corresponding F3 and B3 primer. Primer-containing 4-Plex LAMP reactions received 0.6 \u00b5M each of the four FIP and BIP primers, 0.3 \u00b5M of each of the four loop primers, 0.3 \u00b5M of the capsid stem primer, and 0.15 \u00b5M each of the four F3 and B3 primers. The total primer content of these multiplex assays was the same as individual primer concentrations used in singleplex reactions. Control assays lacking primers received equivalent volume of TE 10:0.1 buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5 and 0.1 mM EDTA pH 8.0).Singleplex assays read using OSD reporters received 200 nM of the fluorophore-labeled strand annealed with a five-fold excess of the complementary quencher-labeled strand (see subsection \"Assembly of strand exchange probes\"). 4-Plex LAMP-OSD assays received 50 nM of each of the four fluorophore-labeled OSD strands pre-annealed individually with five-fold excess of their corresponding quencher-labeled complementary strands.",
