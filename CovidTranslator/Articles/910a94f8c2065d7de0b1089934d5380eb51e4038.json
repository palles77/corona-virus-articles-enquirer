However, the medical use of the heaviest stable element, bismuth-which utilizes its antimicrobial activity and low collateral toxicity-can be traced back to the Middle Ages. Based on our increasing knowledge of the characteristics of bismuth, many of its compounds have been synthesized and used in human healthcare [1] [2] [3] . In particular, bismuth citrate-based (Bi(cit)-based) compounds have been clinically used worldwide to treat peptic ulcers and exhibit promising antiviral activities [4] [5] [6] . Two Bi(cit)-based drugs, colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS, De-Nol \u00ae and Lizhudele \u00ae ) and ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC, Tritec \u00ae and Pylorid \u00ae ), when used in combination with antibodies, show the highest therapeutic efficiency for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection [7] .",

            "text": "Due to the importance of CBS and RBC, enormous efforts have been made to elucidate their structures. However, the structures of bismuth citrate-based complexes are complicated due to their tendency to polymerize. The empirical formula of CBS was previously given as K 3 (NH 4 ) 2 [Bi 6 O 3 -(OH) 5 (Hcit) 4 ], but has been changed to \"polymeric bismuth citrate complex\" in the latest edition of the Merck Index to reflect its complicated polymeric features [8] . Nine bismuth citrate adducts have been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy [9] [10] [11] [12] . Most of them are composed of stable bismuth citrate dimeric units ([Bi(cit) 2 Bi] 2-) and additional O 2-, OHor H 2 O ligands. It is believed that the [Bi(cit) 2 Bi] 2unit forms negatively charged polymeric skeletons in bismuth citrate complexes and aggregates giving a type of \"hybrid\" metal-organic framework (MOF) [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . However, most reports of the structures of bismuth citrate complexes are based on their crys-tals obtained at neutral pH, which may fail to reflect the structural features of Bi(cit)-based complexes when used as drugs, since Bi(cit)-based drugs are designed for treating diseases in the stomach where the physiological acidity is close to pH 3. The crystal structures of Bi(cit)-based complexes at low pH, therefore, can more precisely reflect their structural features under actual therapeutic conditions.",

When two citrate tetraanions coordinate with two Bi 3+ cations, the excess negative charges in these polyanionic frameworks are balanced by [H 3 NCH 2 CH 2 NH 3 ] 2+ or [C 5 H 6 N] + cations. The common structural feature suggests that low-molecular mass molecules or ions can be encapsulated by either a diffusion process or electrostatic interactions, similar to the \"uptake process\" of cations or small molecules by zeolites. However, the size and level of protonatation of the inserted cations also affect the assembly of bismuth citrate dimers. As shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information, different shapes of channels and cavities are formed in the frameworks of 1 and 3 due to the use of different type of cations. The cations fill up the cavities formed in the bismuth citrate skeletons to achieve charge balance. Acidity is another key factor that affects the architecture of bismuth citrate complexes. Using the same cation ([H 3 NCH 2 CH 2 NH 3 ] 2+ ) but crystallizing at different pH, two different types of frameworks were obtained, namely complexes 1 and 4. Growth time is also an important factor. Conversion of complex 1 into 2 was observed when the crystal growth time was extended, indicating that 2 is a more thermodynamically stable form than 1. When the bridging citrate anions that link the adjacent polymeric sheets in 1 are substituted by Cl -, the complex loses the polymeric linkers in one direction which results in the breakup of the 3-D framework. Such a degradation process may be of relevance as far as the pharmacokinetic behavior of bismuth citrate-based drugs in the stomach is concerned.",

            "text": "Although the ESI-MS results give a qualitative reflection of the nature of the bismuth citrate species in solution, quantitative analysis is inappropriate, as the ion signal reflects the extent of chemical ionization as well as relative abundance. If each bismuth citrate species in the series is assumed to be protonated at the same type of site, a semi-quantitative correlation between the abundance and signal intensity is expected. It is certain that low molecular weight bismuth citrate species (dimers) have a higher abundance than that of high molecular weight species (trimers, tetramers). The observation of bismuth citrate oligomers corresponding to tetramers (m/z 1592.5), trimers (m/z 1194.6) and dimers (m/z 796.8) together with gradually increasing abundance indicates that the Bi(cit)-based poly- mers degrade from high molecular weight polymeric species to low molecular weight species (e.g. dimeric units) in solution. In contrast, no such series of degradation peaks is observed for amine-Bi(cit) in the absence of incubation at acidic pH, suggesting that acid plays an essential role in the decomposition of Bi(cit)-based complexes.",

            "text": "X-ray crystal structures of four bismuth citrate-based complexes (1, 2, 3 and 4) reveal that bismuth citrate dimeric units serve as their basic building blocks, leading to all the complexes having polymeric structures with regular meshes and internal cavities. The composition of the complex frameworks depends on the size and level of protonation of the cation, the pH and time of crystallization. The degradation of 1 into 2 may be reflected in the pharmacokinetic behavior of bismuth citrate-based drugs. The polymeric meshes and cavities of complexes 1, 3 and 4 are responsible for their abilities to encapsulate small molecules, as demonstrated by single crystal X-ray diffraction, solid-state NMR, and TG-DTG. Based on the framework of 1, a structural model of RBC, the latest bismuth citrate antiulcer drug, has been constructed, showing how ranitidine molecules insert into polymeric channels inside the bismuth citrate framework. ESI-MS studies of the aminebismuth citrate in acidic solutions depict a possible degradation pathway for the bismuth citrate skeleton in gastric acid (pH \u223c3), i.e. Bi(cit)-based drugs may deposit as a polymer on ulcer craters, then degrade into low molecular weight species either by the action of gastric acid or chloride/water and finally be fully decomposed into basic units such as [Bi(cit) 2 Bi] 2that can be subsequently absorbed by either a membrane receptor such as FecA [20] or transported via iron transport pathways [21] . Based on our studies, we propose a possible pharmacokinetic pathway for bismuth citrate-based drugs involving the degradation of the bismuth citrate skeleton from a 3-D polymeric framework to 2-D polymeric sheets and finally to basic dimeric units under acidic conditions. Such a process at low pH may allow the \"encapsulated\" drugs (e.g. ranitidine) to be released from the porous bismuth citrate matrix. Moreover, the low toxicity and negatively charged frameworks with regular mesh structure suggest that bismuth citrate-based polymers may be a new type of \"hybrid\" metal-organic framework (MOF) with other potential applications, e.g. as a drug carrier.",
