However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.",

We have learned from SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov that human populations showed disparities in susceptibility to these viruses. For example, epidemiology studies found that males had higher incidence and mortality rates than females. 1, 2 We believe that the susceptibility to the novel 2019-nCov is also different among population groups.

However, the sample size was too small to draw conclusion on this racial disparity. Here, we analyzed four large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression. Also, we analyzed two lung tissue single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the distribution of ACE2 gene expression among cell types, which will provide new knowledge for understanding the mechanism and population disparities of 2019-nCov infection.",

Smokers in GSE10072 showed a higher mean of ACE2 gene expression than non-smokers.

These data were from the normal lung tissue of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, which may be different with the lung tissue of healthy people. Therefore, we also analyzed a gene expression dataset of airway epithelium from healthy smokers and healthy non-smokers.

We found a similar but non-significant trend in the GSE10072 due to its small size (ordinal regression p-value=0.11). We didn't observe such a tread in the TCGA dataset.

We also identified a smoking related basal cell subpopulation which might be pro-goblet precursor cells and has been discussed in the study of Duclos G et.al. 14 Interestingly, we found ACE2 is mainly expressed in goblet cells in current smokers and club cells in non-smokers (Fig. 3B) , indicating 2019-nCov may infect different cell types in bronchial epithelium of current smokers and non-smokers.",
