Pathological examinations were performed on four of the puppies. At necropsy examination, the lungs were firm and mottled dark red, consistent with acute bronchopneumonia. Histopathologically, there was marked infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the bronchi and alveoli, and gram-negative coccobacilli were attached diffusely to the cilia of bronchial mucosa. Immunohistochemistry for Bordetella bronchiseptica antigen revealed positive labelling of the bacterial agents. On electron microscopy, a large number of coccobacilli were observed attaching to the cilia of bronchial epithelial cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction amplified a B. bronchiseptica gene from the affected lung tissue. Based on these findings, the four puppies were diagnosed with fatal B. bronchiseptica bronchopneumonia.",

In addition, B. bronchiseptica can be associated with community-acquired infectious pneumonia, especially in puppies (Radhakrishnan et al., 2007) . In a retrospective histopathological study of 36 dogs with bronchopneumonia, eight cases were positive for B. bronchiseptica by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Taha-Abdelaziz et al., 2016) . However, in most cases (6 of 8 cases) bacterial agents had not been noted in the pathology report based on examination of haematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained sections.

Histopathologically, severe suppurative bronchopneumonia with bacterial ciliary adhesion was observed in the lungs of the puppies. Cilia-adherent bacteria in the respiratory tract are a characteristic histopathological finding of B. bronchiseptica infection (Caswell and Williams, 2016) . However, this finding may not be evident in cases of fatal bronchopneumonia, and IHC and PCR examination are required in such cases to detect the aetiological agent (Taha-Abdelaziz et al., 2016) . In the present study, large numbers of cilia-adherent bacteria were found on HE-stained sections of the lungs, indicating severe infection by B. bronchiseptica. Cilia-adhesion, together with production of toxins by B. bronchiseptica, induces ciliostasis of respiratory epithelial cells and further causes secondary infections of other pathogens. Additionally, as shown in the present study, B. bronchiseptica can enter and survive within inflammatory cells and affect the immune system of the host. In the present study, other pathogens were not detected by histopathology or real-time PCR, indicating that B. bronchiseptica infection was the primary cause of the fatal bronchopneumonia. There is genetic diversity in B. bronchiseptica strains; however, the relationship between strains and pathogenicity remains uncertain.",

Maternal antibodies do not interfere with local antibody responses induced by these mucosal vaccines. Maternal antibodies are transferred from dams to puppies via the colostrum, although antibodies are also present in milk, and these may provide some protection of the intestinal mucosa (Decaro et al., 2004) . Maternal antibody may persist for up to 14 weeks in dogs (Gooding and Robinson, 1982; Day et al., 2016) . In the present study, all of the dogs that died were younger than 3 weeks old. Although we could not determine the serum antibody titre of the puppies, the outbreak implicates lack of maternal antibody as a major factor contributing to the development of the fatal B. bronchiseptica bronchopneumonia.",
