            "text": "Cathepsin B is a potential target for the development of drugs to treat several important human diseases. A number of inhibitors targeting this protein have been developed in the past several years. Recently, a group of small molecules were identified to have inhibitory activity against cathepsin B through high throughput screening (HTS) tests. In this study, traditional continuous and binary QSAR models were built to classify the biological activities of previously identified compounds and to distinguish active compounds from inactive compounds for drug development based on the calculated molecular and physicochemical properties. Strong correlations were obtained for the continuous QSAR models with regression correlation coefficients (r 2 ) and cross-validated correlation coefficients (q 2 ) of 0.77 and 0.61 for all compounds, and 0.82 and 0.68 for the compound set excluding 3 outliers, respectively. The models were further validated through the leave-one-out (LOO) method and the training-test set method. The binary models demonstrated a strong level of predictability in distinguishing the active compounds from inactive compounds with accuracies of 0.89 and 0.94 for active and inactive compounds, respectively, in non-cross-validated models. Similar results were obtained for the cross-validated models. Collectively, these results demonstrate the models' ability to discriminate between active and inactive compounds, suggesting that the models may be used to pre-screen compounds to facilitate compound optimization and to design novel inhibitors for drug development.",

Previously identified cathepsins include cathepsin B, D, H, K, L, and S. Several of these proteins have been selected as biological targets to develop therapeutic treatments, and a number of inhibitors have been identified and developed for many of these enzymes. Cathepsin B inhibitors are highly sought after chemical agents since many diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorder, cardiovascular disease, cancer, inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , have been connected with unusual levels or abnormal function of cathepsin B. As an ubiquitous lysosomal cysteine proteases, cathepsin B has been found to be responsible for intracellular as well as extracellular proteolysis in mammalian cells and can facilitate cell migration by dissolving the extracellular barriers, which result in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis [13] [14] [15] . The biological activity and function of cathepsin B is also important during viral infection and replication for several viruses, such as Ebola, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in human cells [16, 17] . Due to its important biological functions, which are directly related to several important human diseases, cathepsin B has been chosen as a drug development target in many efforts.",

Most of these cathepsin inhibitors disable the biological activity of cathepsin B through forming irreversible covalent chemical bond in the catalytic site of the enzyme. These irreversible inhibitors include dipeptidyl nitriles [21] , vinyl sulfones, expoxysuccinates, acyloxymethyl ketones, fluoromethyl ketones, hydrazides, and bis-aamidoketones [22] . Structural studies have provided detailed insights into the biological mechanisms of these inhibitors.

A relative binding affinity was calculated for each compound studied based on the respective modeled bound structure using the linear response molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann-surface area method (LR-MM-PBSA). Strong correlations between the calculated binding affinities and experimental biological activities were obtained [30, 31] . Three-dimensional (3D) Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) models were also established based on the multi-conformation method with high correlation coefficients for these active compounds (to be published). Given the importance of the enzyme in disease treatment and the broad research interest to screen and identify potent inhibitors, efforts have been taken further to build the QSAR models to correlate the molecular and physicochemical properties with the biological activities of the compounds tested in the Cathepsin B inhibition screening experiments. Efforts were also undertaken to build statistical models to classify inhibition activities against Cathepsin B for specific compounds. This work reports the results of the continuous (continuous in bioactivity space) and binary (two discrete bioactivity status, e.g. 'active' vs. 'inactive') QSAR models in order to obtain insight into the relationship of chemical structure and physicochemical properties/biological activity. Additionally, the results of this work may provide means to pre-screen compounds to facilitate in silico design of de novo cathepsin B inhibitors and the development of drugs for the treatment of various human diseases using some other molecular targets.",

            "text": "The 3D chemical structures of all small molecule compounds were first converted from the 2D molecular structures obtained from the PubChem database (PubChem bioAssay accession: 820 and 523) [32] , which were subsequently subjected to energy minimization calculation until the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of potential energy was smaller than 0.001, using the Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations (OPLS) force field [33] [34] [35] [36] by the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) program (Version 2007.09, developed by Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada). In Bioassay AID (Pubchem bioassay accession) 820, 75 compounds were tested by a dose-response confirmatory screening experiment, whereas 37 compounds were confirmed to have inhibitory activity, 35 compounds were confirmed to have no inhibitory activity, and the bioactivity outcome for the remaining 3 compounds were reported as ''inconclusive''. By further examining these active compounds using different experimental protocol, assay depositors suggested that some of them were likely artifacts. Further investigation using several independent bioassay tests (different biological experiments), which may be affected by similar causes of artifact, suggested that five compounds bear greater chance as being false positives, and they were removed from the current analysis. So, 32 active (37 \u00c0 5) and 35 inactive compounds from bioassay 820 were included in the work. Bioassay 523 employed a similar experimental protocol to the Bioassay 820, where 27 compounds were tested, 10 compounds were confirmed having inhibitory activity, 16 compounds were confirmed having no inhibitory activity, and one compound was reported as ''inconclusive''. Four out of the 10 active compounds are unique structures and were added to the active compound list. Total 36 active compounds (32 from bioassay 820 and 4 from bioassay 523) and 51 inactive compounds (35 from bioassay 820 and 16 from bioassay 523) were used in the modeling. The average IC 50 reported in the bioassay depositions was used for the bioactivity of the active compounds. The PubChem compound accession (CID), molecular formula, and biological activity (IC 50 ) for the 86 compounds are listed in Table 1 (one active compound was not included in QSAR modeling as no 3D conformer was obtained in docking simulation). Molecular structure and other information can be obtained from PubChem website based on CIDs (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the bioassay protocol information can be obtained from PubChem website by BioAssay ID (AID) 820 and 523 (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/assay.cgi?aid=820 and http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/assay.cgi?aid=523) [32] . The compounds tested in the confirmatory assays were cherry picked based on the screening results for over 60,000 compounds in a single dose HTS assay for potential cathepsin B inhibition activity (PubChem AID: 453) by measuring the release of the fluorophore aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) from the hydrolysis of an AMC-labeled dipeptide. The large number of inactive compounds from the primary HTS assay was not included in the model since the statistical methods typically do not perform well on unbalanced data sets. Therefore claiming all compounds as inactive will yield an accuracy of 99.94% as pointed out by Weis et al. [37] . The three-dimensional structure coordinate of cathepsin protein bound with dipeptidyl nitrile (DPN) was obtained from Protein Databank (PDB code: 1GMY [21] ). The PDB file for the crystallographic structure complex of cathepsin B contains three chains A, B and C. The first two chains form a dimer and were used in docking simulation (Fig. 1) . Hydrogen atoms and partial charges were added to the protein and then short steps of minimization were performed to relax the newly added hydrogen atoms and the potential steric contacts in the original PDB coordinates. The minimizations were performed using an OPLS force field following the standard protocol of the Glide program (version 8 in FirstDiscovery suite) [38, 39] . The minimized protein structure was then used to generate a docking grid which was used to docked all active compounds into the DPN binding site. A docking box (exterior box) of 16 \u00c2 18 \u00c2 22 \u00c5 for the placement of all ligand atoms and a restraining box (interior box) of 8 \u00c2 10 \u00c2 14 \u00c5 for the placement of ligand geometric center were used to generate the docking grid. The boxes were centered at the geometric center of DPN ligand. Default values were used for all other settings within Glide (version 8).",

The alignment was carried out based on molecular shape (volume) and pharmacophore elements using the flexible alignment module implemented in MOE, default parameters were used for the flexible alignment.

Initial selection for the descriptors was attempted empirically based on the nature of the descriptors, the features of the studied molecular set, and the problem studied. Those which are not relevant to the modeling, such as the total energy, heat of formation, the numbers of bromine, boron, fluorine, or phosphorus atoms, were eliminated from further consideration in the work. Over 50 descriptors of physicochemical molecular properties were selected and calculated for all studied compounds based on the constructed 3D conformations using the methods implemented in MOE (version 2007.09). Factor analyses were performed to examine the correlation between each individual descriptor and the biological activity (log IC 50 ) of these compounds. The nine descriptors that demonstrated an apparent correlation with the observed biological activity were chosen to build QSAR models, which are listed in Table 2 . Among these descriptors, N acc+don is the sum of the counts of hydrogen acceptor and donor. Apol, MR, and Dipole are the sum of atomic polarizabilities [41] , molar refractivity, and the dipole moment of a molecule calculated from the partial charges of the molecule, respectively. SA and SA pol are the water accessible surface areas (WASA) of whole molecule and the hydrophilic part of WASA calculated using a radius of 1.4 \u00c5 for the probe, respectively. Vol, E sol , and log P (o/w) are the molecular volume, the empirical solvation energy calculated based on OPLS force field, and the log value of octanol/water partition coefficient of a compound, respectively. Most of these descriptors are related to the molecular solvation properties to some degree. Calculation of molecular solvation or partition of a compound between hydrophobic and hydrophilic compartments still remains challenging. Combination of various computational methods would be a better choice to estimate the chemical's partition property which is well regarded to have direct and large effect on its biological activities.",

The binary QSAR model was developed as an economic QSAR model to be used distinguish active vs. inactive compounds in HTS experiments to assist model drug development. All binary models were built using the binary method module of MOE [42, 43] . Similarly to the process of continuous model construction, the ''all binary model'' was first built with all 86 compounds to examine the predictability of the model for the ''inside'' compounds, the compounds used to build a model, and followed by validations using the LOO method and three training-test sets to examine the predictability and robustness of the QSAR models for ''outside'' compounds. The predicted results for the all binary model are listed in Table 9 and the statistical results are listed in Table 13 . All 86 compounds, except for four active and three inactive ones, were predicted correctly with this non-validated model ( Table 9 ). The prediction accuracies (Table 13 ) for all compounds are 0.919, and for active and inactive compounds are 0.886 and 0.941 respectively. This demonstrates the strong classification power of this model for discriminating inactive compounds from active compounds. In addition, four cross-validated models were built, one from LOO and three from the training-test-set method. In the latter three models, the compounds were randomly split into training set (80 compounds) and test set (6 compounds). The four models were designated as Table 6 The training-test model 2: the predicted activities and residues of 36 compounds in the training set and 6 compounds in the test set. Table 7 The training-test model 3: the predicted activities and residues of 36 compounds in the training set and 6 compounds in the test set. (Table 13) . These validated models clearly demonstrated their abilities to distinguish active vs. inactive compounds with high efficiency and accuracy, which indicates their strong potential for in silico screening of small molecules. It is noted that the prediction accuracies for active compounds were slightly, but consistently, lower than those for the inactive compounds. Such phenomenon could arise from the unbalanced nature of the data set regarding to bioactivity classes (active and inactive in this work). The larger population of inactive compounds over that of the active ones shifts the splitting point used to determine the active vs. inactive to the active side. Such shift results in more active compounds at the border line of being To solve the problem, one could design a weighting schema to ''overestimate'' the type of compounds that are underrepresented in the data set. In many cases, however, such unbalance would not cause a severe effect on the application of the method when the focus is to select a molecule with a given property, such as eliminating inactive molecules to further develop active compounds in designing cathepsin B inhibitors.",
