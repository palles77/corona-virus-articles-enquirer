            "text": "The KSA applicants do not ''look good on paper''. There are a several reasons why KAFP applicant performance on these exams is low compared to other applicants. The GRE contains information based on North American cultural norms and therefore can be considered culturally biased [8] . Due to different cultures, languages, and educational systems, foreign students tend to score substantially lower than Americans [7] . The use of topics such as sports, literature, and art in questions may make it more difficult for someone of a different cultural background to answer correctly within the allotted time period, no matter how intelligent or proficient in English they are. Furthermore, it was determined that GRE scores under-predicted grades received by older students and over-predicted the graduate ability of younger students [5] . This observation could be an explanation for the situation of KA Fellows, who, as mid-career professionals, have been able to outperform expectations drawn from their GRE results ( Fig. 1 ). Although their performance on the GRE may be lower than that of other applicants, their performance in the actual MPH program is commensurate with that of other students (see Tables 1-6) .",

            "text": "While scores on both the TOEFL and IELTS exams are reliable indicators of English proficiency, it should be noted that correlations are negligible between TOEFL and GPA [4] . This is because above a certain level of English proficiency, other factors such as previous experience with subject matter, determination, academic aptitude, cultural awareness, and financial security have greater influence on academic success [6] . Medical training and work experience provide KA Fellows with both background knowledge and vocabularies well adapted for common class topics. In addition, KA Fellows, like any other students, have the ability to preview and review course material, record lectures, use dictionaries, and ask questions in and out of class. These facts allow KA Fellows to overcome any possible English weakness. Another factor unique to KA Fellows, which may explain their ability to succeed beyond what their standardized test scores predict, is the academic support they receive. KA Fellows receive supplemental instruction and editing assistance from full-time English as a Second Language (ESL) instructors as well as from tutors in biostatistics, epidemiology, data analysis and accounting. KA Fellows also receive cultural awareness training upon arrival. On the Saudi side, once they have been accepted, MoH employees often have a difficult time securing leave from their jobs, which often delays their arrival. Additionally, Ramadan, a holy month for Muslims, has occurred over the summer in recent years, resulting in delays in public and government sectors, and also affecting students' arrival [9] . Students routinely miss orientation on account of these issues. After they have received approval for leave from the MoH and been accepted to Emory, the Ministry of Civil Service must provide the final clearance for their departure. Yearly, students experience significant delays in this process, which impedes their ability to adjust to life in a new country in time to start their first semester without stress. Sometimes they arrive after classes begin.",

They also lack exposure to higher-level math, which they do not study in medical school and may not have taken since 10th grade. In addition to these academic issues, there are personal challenges. KA Fellows generally have larger family sizes than other students, and along with that, increased family pressures (taking care of small children, dealing with illnesses) that take them away from their studies. Additionally, the cultural and religious atmospheres of KSA and the United States are vastly different, and adjusting to life in the United States (while also helping family members adjust) can be difficult. Lastly, these physicians must live under the financial strain of earning only half of their salaries in an expensive city.",

The late King Abdullah invested tremendously in the health sector and specifically the public health sector.

In the first part of the 20th century, successes that accompanied the implementation of preventive measures inspired stronger governmental and societal involvement in public health. In 1935, through the Social Security Act, the government allocated funding to support public health services and workforce training (Future of Health). In 1946, the federal government established The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is now at the forefront of U.S. public health efforts to prevent and control infections and chronic diseases, injuries, workplaces hazards, disabilities, and environmental health threats [2] . The CDC then formed the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) in 1951, an applied epidemiology training and service program through which officers conduct epidemiologic investigations and public health surveillance within and outside of the United States [3] . Since then, government organizations and universities across the United States have instituted preventive medicine residencies and fellowships, where health professionals gain hands-on experience in public health agencies at the federal, state, and local levels [1] .",
