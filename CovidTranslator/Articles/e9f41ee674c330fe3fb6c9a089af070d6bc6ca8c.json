            "text": "A significant advance towards establishing a correlation between replicon inhibition and clinical efficacy was recently accomplished with the disclosure of preliminary clinical data for BILN-2061, a selective inhibitor of the NS3 serine protease of HCV that is structurally related to 13. This highly modified macrocylic tripeptide derivative is extremely potent in vitro, with K, values of 0.3 nM and 0.66 nM towards HCV-la and HCV-1 b NS3 proteases, respectively (29). These figures are similar to the potency observed in cell culture in the cognate HCV replicons, EC50 = 4 nM and 3 nM, respectively (29). Antiviral efficacy was established in a study conducted with 10 patients with chronic HCV and significant liver fibrosis, where all patients treated with BILN-2061 (200 mg p.o. b.i.d.) displayed a decrease in serum HCV RNA levels of at least 2.0 log,, copies/mL after two days of treatment (30). Four of these patients recorded a reduction in viral load of more than 3 orders of magnitude and viral titers returned to baseline following cessation of therapy, with no drug-related safety issues identified (31). The intensity of effort devoted towards the discovery of inhibitors of HCV NS3 has continued, with the focus largely on peptide-based molecules that are required to effectively complement the active site and proximal regions of the protease (32-34). The crystal structure of a macrocyclic inhibitor related to 13 bound to HCV protease has been disclosed and an acyclic tripeptidic inhibitor has been used to generate resistant subgenomic replicons in which mutations mapped to the protease (3836). Amongst several strategies disclosed, the C-terminal carboxylate of peptide inhibitors may be replaced with an N-acyl sulfonamide moiety, as exemplified by 14 (37). Novel approaches to constrain or mimic the peptidic backbone are represented by macrocycle l5, the tetrahydroindolizine B (IC 5~ = 0.12 PM), the imidazolone 17 and the bicyclic proline derivative 18 (K, = 0.042 PM, KS0 = 0.251 pM) (38-46). These inhibitors are constructed around either an a-keto amide or a boronic acid moiety, wellprecedented as serine protease inhibitor motifs that engage the catalytic serine residue in a covalent but reversible interaction.",

More than 6500 SARS infections were documented worldwide within the following 2 months that were associated with substantial morbidity, including fever, non-productive cough, malaise, chills, headache and dyspnea, and significant mortality, with over 460 deaths reported (146). Whilst SARS appears to have originated in Southern China in November, 2002, reports of major outbreaks in Hong Kong and Toronto, Canada in March 2003 brought the disease to world prominence (143-145). The attributes of modern technology, communication and international teamwork led to the rapid isolation and sequencing of the virus causing SARS, identified as a novel coronavirus with little similarity to previously known human coronaviruses (147-153). Final confirmation came with the demonstration that infection of monkeys with SARS produced a syndrome identical to that seen in man and that virus could subsequently recovered (154). These experiments were rapidly followed by the development of diagnostic assays based on a real-time quantitative PCR method and a TaqMan protocol (148, 155). Transmission of SARS appears to be via person-person contact with infected droplets rather than airborne and, possibly, a fecal-oral route. Inhibitors of coronaviruses are largely unknown although treatment with ribavirin (11) and oseltamivir have been examined in an empirical fashion (143, 156).",
