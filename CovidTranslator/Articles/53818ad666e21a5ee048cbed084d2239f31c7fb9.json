As indicated in FIG. 2 , amantadine blocks the migration of H + ions into the interior of the virus particles (virions) within endosomes, a process that is needed for the uncoating to occur. The H + ions are imported through the M2 (matrix 2) channels 10 ; the transmembrane domain of the M2 protein, with the amino-acid residues facing the ion-conducting pore, is shown in FIG. 3a (REF. 11 ). Amantadine has been postulated to block the interior channel within the tetrameric M2 helix bundle 12 .",

Two structures of the influenza A virus neuraminidase have now been solved: the first containing the N1 neuraminidase of H5N1, and the second containing the N2 neuraminidase as in H3N2 38 (FIG. 5c) . The neuraminidase inhibitors make contact with arginine in position 292 through their carboxylic acid group, and with glutamic acid in position 119 through their basic amine (in the case of oseltamivir) or guanidinium (in the case of zanamivir) group. So, it is not surprising that at these positions mutations (R292K, E119G) can arise that engender resistance to both zanamivir and oseltamivir 39 . The R292K mutation causes high-level resistance to oseltamivir but only low-level (5-30-fold) resistance to zanamivir. In a comprehensive study of more than 1,000 clinical influenza isolates recovered from 1996 to 1999, there was no evidence of naturally occurring resistance to either oseltamivir or zanamivir in any of the isolates 40 . However, in children treated for influenza with oseltamivir, Kiso et al. 41 found neuraminidase mutations in viruses from nine patients (18%), six of whom had mutations at position 292 (R292K) and two at position 119 (E119V). Zanamivir-resistant influenza H3N2 viruses might not readily arise in vivo owing to their poor viability (reduced fitness) 42 .",

T-705 is a substituted pyrazine with potent anti-influenzavirus activity in vitro and in vivo. According to a comparative study, T-705 would even be more potent than oseltamivir when increasing the multiplicity of infection (in vitro) or using a higher virus-challenge dose (in vivo) 95 . It has been postulated that T-705 is converted intracellularly to the ribonucleotide T-705-4-ribofuranosyl-5\u2032-monophosphate (T-705 RMP) by a phosphoribosyl transferase and, on further phosphorylation to its 5\u2032-triphosphate (FIG. 7) , T-705 RTP would then inhibit influenza-virus RNA polymerase in a GTP-competitive manner 96 . Unlike ribavirin 5\u2032-monophosphate, T-705 RMP did not significantly inhibit IMP dehydrogenase, indicating that it owes its anti-influenza virus activity mainly, if not exclusively, to inhibition of the influenzavirus RNA polymerase.",

The latter inhibits inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase, a crucial enzyme in the biosynthesis of RNA, including viral RNA. IMP dehydrogenase is responsible for the conversion of IMP into xanthosine 5\u2032-monophosphate (XMP) which, in turn, is further converted to GMP (guanosine 5\u2032-monophosphate), GDP (guanosine 5\u2032-diphosphate) and GTP (guanosine 5\u2032-triphosphate). The latter serves as substrate, together with ATP, UTP and CTP, in the synthesis of RNA.

Likewise, the signalling cascade could be considered an attractive opportunity for future strategies to block influenza-virus production. The export of the influenza-virus ribonucleoprotein (RNP) from the nucleus depends on the cellular Raf/MEK/ERK kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade 112 , and this PKC\u03b1-mediated activation of ERK signalling is specifically triggered by the accumulation of influenza-A-virus haemagglutinin at the cell membrane 113 .

This binding site is also required for efficient virus replication. A fragment of CPSF30, termed F2F3 because it spans the second and third zinc-finger domains, was found to specifically bind to the CPSF30 binding site: it inhibited influenza-A-virus replication but did not inhibit the 3\u2032-end processing of cellular pre-mRNAs.

In the therapy (or prophylaxis) of influenza-virus infections, the combination of (PEGylated) interferon and ribavirin could be further complemented with amantadine (or rimantadine). This triple-drug combination has shown efficacy in the treatment of chronic HCV infection 115 . Against influenza, such a triple-drug regimen might theoretically be expected to yield a beneficial outcome. The three drugs are, individually, all active against influenza-virus replication in vitro and act through different mechanisms, which implies that, when combined, they might achieve an additive or even synergistic action, while reducing the risk of emergence of drug-resistant virus variants. As early as 1984, Hayden et al. 116 pointed to the additive synergistic action between interferon-\u03b12 and rimantadine or ribavirin. Similarly, combinations of (PEGylated) interferon with neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir, oseltamivir or peramivir) could also be considered, and so might combinations of ribavirin (or viramidine) with the neuraminidase inhibitors.",
