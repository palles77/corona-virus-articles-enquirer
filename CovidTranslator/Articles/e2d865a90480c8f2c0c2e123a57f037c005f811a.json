The first infective virus was detected on the cells 4 hours post infection, followed by rapid release of the virus into the culture fluids. Virus-induced syncytia in BALB/c-3T3 cell cultures caused hemadsorption at 4 \u00b0 C and viral antigens were shown to be located in the cytoplasm of the syncy~ia by immunofluorescent techniques. By scanning electron-microscopy, budding virus-like particles were detected on the surface of virus-induced syncytia. Morphologically the virus was shown to be enveloped and approximately 100 nm in diameter. Two types of projections were demonstrated, one type of projection was club-shaped, 20 nm in length and the other type was small, granular, 5 nm in length. The latter type of projection might be the basal part of the clubshaped type and related to the hemagglutinating activity.",

            "text": "When cells were infected at low multiplicities of infection (approximately, M O I = 0 . 1 ) , small syneytia were detectable at 8 hours p.i. At 18 to 24 hours p.i., all areas of the cell sheet consisted of syncytia. Subsequently, syneytial lysis began from the center of each syncytium and progressed toward the periphery. The relationships between virus production and formation of syncytium were examined by a comparison of HA titers of the culture fluid with the cell-fusion ratio during the replicative cycle oi the virus (Fig. 1) . As can be seen from Fig. 1 , HA activity was detected at 8 hours p.i. but development of syncytium lagged behind. Maximum syneytium development occurred between 12 and 18 p.i. HA titers reached a peak by 11 hours p.i. and remained constant. The surface of uninfected cells were covered with microvilli (Fig. 3A) , as previously shown for many celt lines, but following infection with DVIM (t0 hours p.i.) the surface area of syney\u00a2ia were shown to be covered with a large number of spherical buds (Fig. 3B) . The buds were moderately pleomorphic in shape, approximately 100--130 nm in diameter. Particles of a similar size were not detected on the surface of uninfected cells. Therefore we conclude those particles are budding virions. This conclusion is further substa.ntiated by the observation that mouse erythrocytes were exclusively adsorbed to syncy~ia. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4A the size of the syneytia could be delineated by the location of adsorbed erythrocytes. At a high magnification, a large number of particles were etearly visible in the area of hemadsorption (Fig. 4B ). Fig. 5 shows the growth curve of DVIM in BALB/c-3T3 cells. The production of CAV was detected within 4 hours p.i., followed by a rapid exponential increase. At 6 hours p.i., CAV titer reached a maximum level (105.3 TCIDs0/0.1 ml). The production of ECV was later than that of CAV, but the titer was 105.3 TCID50/ 0.1 ml at 10 hours p.i. Although syncytium formation was very rarely detected at 6 hours p.i., approximately 80 per cent of the cells were fused by 18 hour and detachment from the glass surface followed. H A titers of CAV increased rapidly from 4 to 6 hours p.i. corresponding to a rapid increase in virus production from 10 \u00b0.s to 105.a TCIDs0/0.i ml, and ~he titer continued to increase until 8 hours p.i. HA titers of ECV were delayed by approximately 2 hours compared to those of CAV. Infectivity of CAV and ECV decreased from 12 hours p.i., corresponding to rapid degeneration of infected cells and possibly virions, while the HA titer of ECV remained constant until 24 hours p.i. at 37 \u00b0 C. The estimated time required for one step growth of DVIM was approximately 6 hours. ",

Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of coronaviruses, has been described as a common cause of enteric infection in baby mice (8, 21) . On the other hand, lethal intestinal virus of infant mice (LIVIM), first described by K~AST, is probably the most important viral agent of diarrhea in new-born mice (3, 17) , but there was no viral agent detected. However, the epidemiological and pathological characterization of diarrhea of new-borne mice is consistent with the recorded pathology of LIVIM, and suggests that a MHV could be the cause of this disease (5, 7, 14, 16) .",

The agent passes through a 100 nm filter but not a 50 nm filter. Serologically, DVIM was shown to be related to IBV and MHV-2 by a complement fixation test but they were clearly distinguishable from each other by neutralization assays. These observations suggested that this new isolate, DVIM, is a member of coronavirus. However, it was important to establish the morphological characteristics of purified DVIM, since eoronavirus classification, is established mainly by means of characteristic morphology at present.",

Characteristic coronavirus projections attached to the virion were demonstrable. However morphologically DVIM appears to be slightly different in that additional small granular projections were observed. A similar small projection on enteric bovine coronavirus has been reported recently (4) . But no additional projection has been detected on MHV-2, propagated and purified in the same manner as DVIM (data not shown). The morphological relationships of the two projections, club-shaped and granular, are at present not clear. However, it is possible that the club-shaped projection might be attached to the granular projection. Moreover, the HA activity of DVIM was only slightly affected by sonication, which suggests that the HA activity of ])VIM might be associated with the small granular projection.",

The surface profile of DVIMinfected cells has a prominent resemblance to the cells infected with ortho-or para-myxoviruses (1, 12, 27). As described previously (240, it is clear that the hemadsorption of DVIM was not due to the \"pseudohemadsorption\" (6).
