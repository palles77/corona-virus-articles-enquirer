Methods: Open trial in which the intervention group (64 children) received OPV at the age of 2, 3, 6 and 12 months. The control group (250 children) received IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) at the age of 6 and 12 months. Clinical symptoms were recorded by a questionnaire at the age of 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Results: Otitis media episodes were less frequent in the OPV than in the control group. A significant difference was seen at the age of 6-18 months (IRR = 0.76 [95% CI 0.59-0.94], P = 0.011) and was particularly clear among children, who attended daycare (IRR 0.37 [95% CI 0.19-0.71], P = 0.003).",

            "text": "Vaccines against the most well-known enteroviruses, polioviruses, are routinely used in almost all countries, while vaccines are not available for other enteroviruses. In Finland, as well as in an increasing number of other countries, children are routinely vaccinated against poliomyelitis with the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV, Salk vaccine). The other type of polio vaccine, oral live vaccine (OPV, Sabin vaccine), is also used widely. In contrast to IPV, OPV induces a strong local immune response in the gastrointestinal tract and a strong systemic cell-mediated immune response [4] . Previous studies have shown that cell-mediated immune responses to polioviruses cross-react with non-polio enteroviruses due to their structural similarities [5] [6] [7] . However, it is not clear if this cross-reactivity can provide cross-protection against non-polio enteroviruses [8] . In addition, the replication of OPV strains for prolonged periods leads to long-lasting type 1 interferon response and an antiviral state, which can further improve the resistance to other viruses. In contrast to OPV, IPV lacks these properties. IPV induces mainly antibodies, and the antibody-mediated protection is poliovirus specific. In addition, IPV is considered to induce much weaker and shorter type 1 interferon secretion. Viral interference has been reported in a number of studies. Recently Wang et al. noticed a negative association between the presence of rhinovirus (HRV) and adenovirus (HAdV) in military recruits, suggesting viral interference between HRV and HAdV [9] . In addition, the start of the influenza pandemic was delayed at the beginning of the autumn in 2009 in France, possibly due to viral interference between rhinoviruses and influenza A (H1N1) viruses [10] . Such interference may result from the non-specific innate immune response. The interferon response caused by HRV induces a refractory state in the respiratory tract preventing infections by other respiratory viruses. A study assessing the factors affecting immunogenicity of the first two doses of OPV among unimmunized Mayan infants revealed viral interference also between Sabin type 2 and Sabin type 3 polioviruses. In addition, concurrent enteric nonpolio enterovirus infections seemed to lead to reduced antibody responses to Sabin types 1 and 2 [11] . The objective of this study was to assess whether the abovementioned properties of live attenuated poliovirus vaccine (OPV) can lead to clinically relevant interference with non-polio viruses. Therefore, we carried out a vaccine trial to study the effect of OPV on the occurrence otitis media in children younger than 2 years of age. As enteroviruses, including also rhinoviruses, are a common cause of otitis media, we hypothesized that OPV would reduce the incidence of otitis media.",

Altogether 89.8% of the children (92.2% of the OPV vaccinated and 89.2% of the IPV vaccinated) completed the entire follow-up. In the OPV group 3.1% and 4.7% of the subjects dropped out at the ages of 12 and 18 months, and in the IPV group 0.4%, 6.0% and 4.4% dropped out at the ages of 6, 12 and 18 months, respectively. A total number of 854 OM episodes were recorded with an average of 2.72 per child during the follow-up. The OPV vaccinated children had slightly less OM episodes during the first 2 years of life than the IPV vaccinated controls (average number 2.59 vs. 2.75 per child, IRR = 0.87 [95% CI 0.72-1.04]), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.121). Since the protecting effect of OPV probably occurred at the age when vaccine viruses were actively replicating in the gut mucosa (at the age of 2-18 months) and when the incidence of OM peaks (at the age of 6-18 months), the numbers of OM episodes were further analyzed between the age of 6 and 18 months. A significant difference was seen between the OPV and IPV groups in the number of OM episodes during this age period (1.58 vs. 1.88 episodes per child, IRR = 0.76 [95% CI 0.59-0.94], P = 0.011). The protective effect of OPV was even stronger among subjects who had started daycare already at the age of 12 months or earlier (P = 0.003; Fig. 2 ).

Viruses play an important role in the etiology of OM and predispose to bacterial invasion to the middle ear leading to purulent infection. It has also been estimated that 20-50% of acute OM cases are due to virus infections without bacterial co-infection [1, 16] . Picornaviruses (including rhino-and enteroviruses) are the most common viruses in acute OM in children followed closely by other viruses such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, RSV, adenovirus, human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus and coronavirus [17, 18] . Moreover, rhinoviruses have been shown to be the most prevalent pathogens in lower respiratory infections in infants [19, 20] .

            "text": "As a virus infection often initiates bacterial OM, it would be highly beneficial to prevent the initial viral infection. In fact, the influenza A vaccine has been observed to decrease OM episodes by 32-71% during the influenza seasons [22, 23] . The efficacy is so better than that of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, but the type of vaccine may also be important for this protection [24] . Conjugated polysaccharide vaccines, like the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, are serotype-specific and do not protect from infections caused by serotypes not included in the vaccine [25] . In contrast, live attenuated virus vaccines can often induce viral-interference and immunological cross-reactivity against other genetically related agents. This is the first study to assess the effect of a live attenuated enterovirus vaccine (OPV) on non-polio infections in childhood. Picornaviruses comprise approximately 300 different serotypes capable of infecting humans and causing symptoms. As polioviruses belong to picornaviruses, which are the main causative group of viruses causing acute OM, our finding that OPV can indeed reduce acute OM episodes suggests that OPV may interfere with other picornaviruses which are causing OM. Our finding is also indirectly supported by some earlier studies. According to reports from the 1960s, concurrent infection with other enteroviruses demonstrated interference with the OPV vaccination, being infavourable for the vaccine [26, 27] . Epidemiological observations from South America suggest that non-specific intestinal interference generated by OPV strains reduced mortality from infantile diarrhea [28] . This knowledge was utilized in Bulgaria in 1975, when universal administration of OPV was applied to help terminate a non-poliovirus epidemic [29] . Thus, this kind of viral interference seems to have a clear biological effect. Such interference can be caused by at least two different mechanisms: (1) cross-protection against genetically related non-polio enteroviruses mediated by cross-reactive cellular immune responses or (2) induction of type 1 interferons and other antiviral innate immune system responses which can protect against many different viruses. Compared to many other viruses the interfering effect of OPV may be particularly strong, since the replication of vaccine virus strains lasts for longer periods than that of many other viruses replicating for weeks and sometimes even for months in vaccinated individuals and leading to long-lasting and strong activation in both the innate and the adaptive immune system. As enteroviruses (including also rhinoviruses) constitute the most important virus group causing OM, even a modest protective effect may have an important clinical impact.",

Several risk factors for OM have been identified. Our findings that daycare, number of siblings and male gender increase the incidence of OM are in line with previous observations [31] . The fact that the protective effect of OPV was seen particularly among those children who started daycare at a young age is probably due to their strong exposure to viruses causing OM. In addition, the protective effect was strongest at the age of 6-18 months when acute OM peaks. This fits also into the time period when the interfering effect of OPV is expected to occur, if the vaccine is given four times before age of 12 months. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, since the number of the study subjects was relatively small and certain possible confounding factors, e.g. antibiotic treatments during the follow-up could not be taken in to account. The possible confounding effect of other vaccines is unlikely, since the coverage of the national vaccination program was very high (93.3-95.2%) and additional vaccines were rarely given (data not shown).",

Our study has also the important advantage that the symptoms were recorded during consecutive visits at the study clinic in a prospective follow-up where the maximum time period from the previous visit was only 6 months. Thus, it is very likely that the parents were able to recall OM episodes reliably over such a short period.
