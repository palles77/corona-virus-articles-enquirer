The rapid increase in biotechnology, the failure of both the legal system and the legislatures to deal with new and pressing issues, and, in the United States, the increasing liability crisis have driven the medical community to seek answers to some of the difficult questions practitioners have had to work through on a daily basis [1] . The clinical application of bioethics relies on case-based (casuistic) reasoning, in general favoring patients' autonomy and values, but also considering other relevant bioethical principles, including those values inscribed in communal ethics and professional oaths and codes. It is incumbent upon emergency physicians, whenever possible, to determine not only each patient's individual values, but also whether the patient subscribes to an individualistic or a communitarian ethic. Such determinations may help decide who the most appropriate decision makers will be if the patient lacks the capacity to make his or her own decisions.",

Laws stem from legislative statutes, administrative agency rules, or court decisions. They often vary in different locales and are enforceable only in the jurisdictions where they prevail. Ethics incorporates the broad values and beliefs of correct conduct. Although bioethical principles do not change because of geography (at least not within one culture), the interpretation of both ethical and legislative principles may evolve as societies change. But, while good ethics often makes good law, good law does not necessarily make good ethics. Most laws, while based loosely on societal principles, are actually derived from other laws. Ethical principles, however, are derived from the values of the society in which they are proposed.",

The second is that legal cases provide an insight into our social contract, demonstrating the level of societal acceptance of some knotty issues.

The law also has some unalterable directives, sometimes called ''black-letter laws,'' that require specific actions. Bioethics, while based on principles, is designed to weigh every specific situation on its own merits. Perhaps the key difference between bioethics and the law is that bioethics relies heavily on the individual's valuesdbe they those of the patient or of the patient's surrogate. Also, even without the intervention of trained bioethicists, medical personnel can and should be able to make ethically sound decisions. The law does not consider individual values and generally requires lawyers for interpretation.",

On occasion, clarity within the law can lead to clearer thinking in bioethics (and vice versa). Both law and bioethics, for example, use the term rights, as in ''patients' rights'' and ''the right to die.'' This term, often used to advance an ethical argument about medical care, is frequently misunderstood or applied erroneously. Having a right implies that a person, group, or the state has a corresponding moral and legal duty. Without a duty to act, there can be no rights. The rights can either be positive, dictating that a person or group act in a specific manner, or negative, requiring that they refrain from acting. Legal requirements, other authorities, or individual conscience can bestow rights, an act that requires a corresponding duty by those with the power to act, such as health care providers [2] . This obligation to act can be based upon an individual's personal values, professional position, or other commitment [3] . For the physician, this duty to act is a role responsibility, at least when holding oneself out as a physiciandand possibly at all times. The role-duty link occurs ''whenever a person occupies a distinctive place or office in a social organization, to which specific duties are attached to provide for the welfare of others or to advance in some specific way the aims or purposes of the organization'' [4] . In this circumstance, performance is not predicated on a guarantee of compensation, but on a concern for another person's welfare [5] . The emergency physician has just such a duty.",

            "text": "Ethical traditions stretch back to earliest recorded history. Separate bodies of ethics, often encompassing a general system rather than a true theory, were developed in India and China, and within the Jewish, Christian, Islamic, and Buddhist religions. All these theories represent altruistic, rather than egoistic, attitudes toward mankind. Ethical theories represent the grand ideas on which guiding principles are based, attempting to be coherent and systematic, while striving to answer fundamental, practical questions: What ought I do? How ought I live? Ethicists normally appeal to these principles, rather than the underlying theory, when defending a particular action. Western bioethics continues to encompass a number of theories, some quite contradictory. Some of the most commonly cited include: Natural law. This system, often attributed to Aristotle, posits that man should live life according to an inherent human nature. It can be contrasted with man-made, or judicial, law. Yet, they are similar in that both may change over time, despite the frequent claim that natural law is immutable [7] . Deontology. This theory holds that the most important aspects of our lives are governed by certain unbreakable moral rules. Deontologists hold that these rules may not be broken, even if breaking them may improve an outcome. In other words, they may do the ''right'' thing, even though the consequences of that action may not be ''good.'' The famous philosopher, Immanuel Kant, is often identified with this theory. One example of a list of ''unbreakable'' rules is the Ten Commandments [8] . Utilitarianism. One of the more functional and commonly used theories, utilitarianism, sometimes called consequentialism or teleology, promotes good or valued ends, rather than using the right means. This theory instructs adherents to work for those outcomes that will most advantage the majority of those affected in the most impartial way possible. Utilitarianism is often simplistically described as advocating methods to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people. It is often advocated as the basis for broad social policies [9] . Virtue theory. This theory asks what a ''good person'' would do in specific real-life situations. This recently revived theory stems from the character traits discussed by Aristotle, Plato, and Thomas Aquinas. They discuss such timeless and cross-cultural virtues as courage, temperance, wisdom, justice, faith, and charity. Recently, the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine took the unusual step of adopting a virtue-based code of conduct (Box 2) [10] . Other theories. Other ethical theories are rarely applied within the scope of bioethics, and each has serious, if not fatal, flaws. Rights theory is based on respecting others' rights. The social contract tradition is based on the implicit agreement we make with others to exist in a cooperative society. Prima facie duties, although less rigid than deontology, lays down certain duties each person has toward others. Egoism advocates that each person live so as to further his or her own interests, a theory in direct opposition to altruism.",

As members of democracies with significant populations practicing a number of religions and subgroups of those religions, Western emergency medical practitioners must behave in a manner consistent with the values of each patient. While many people cannot answer the question, ''What are your values?,'' physicians can get an operational answer by asking what patients see as the goal of their medical therapy and why they want specific interventions. The underlying question must be: ''What is the patient's desired outcome for medical care?'' Responses from patients represent concrete expressions of patient values. In patients too young or incompetent to express their values, it may be necessary for physicians to make general assumptions about what the normal person would want in a specific situation or to rely on surrogate decision-making. However, with patients who are able to communicate, care must be taken to discover what they hold as their own, uncoerced values. A typical, ethically dangerous scenario Honesty, imparting truth and uncertainty openly, and identifying clearly for my patients all trainees and students involved in their care. Mentorship, nurturing and encouraging the requisite technical, intellectual, and moral virtues of the profession in students of every kind through my words and deeds.",

When such conflicts exist, it is morally and legally acceptable, within certain constraints, for the individual to follow a course of action based upon his or her own value system. The constraints generally require that there be the provision of timely and adequate medical care for the patient, which may be particularly difficult to achieve in emergency medicine. The most common conflict has been about whether to provide emergency contraception. Consensus generally discourages delaying necessary medical treatments, including emergency contraception, since patients often have no choice about the emergency department to which they go and cannot know the practitioners' attitudes about such treatment in advance [15, 16] . When conflicts over values exist, however, it is essential for the practitioner to recognize the patient's identity, dignity, and autonomy to avoid the error of blindly imposing one's own values on others.",

Second, they must become educators, teaching their lay patients enough about their diseases and treatments to make rational decisions. Finally, and most distressing to clinicians, is accepting that some patients will make what clinicians consider to be foolish choices. For physicians dedicated to preserving their patients' well being, allowing people to select what the physician considers poor treatment options (such as refusing treatment or opting for ineffective regimens) may be both frustrating and disheartening. Yet, allowing these ''foolish'' choices is part of accepting the principle of patient autonomy.

This different prioritization becomes vitally important during ethical dilemmas, when values often conflict. The application of one set of values instead of another may lead to radically different outcomes. In contrast to the Western emphasis on autonomy, communitarians cleave to the Aristotelian view that ''Man is a social animal, indeed a political animal, because he is not self-sufficient alone, and in an important sense is not selfsufficient outside a polis.'' Typical communities may be related to one another by geographical location, a morally significant history, or may work together for common goals in a trusting and altruistic manner. In practice, communitarian values are found in many patients presenting to emergency departments who have close family interrelationships and whose sense of self is bound to their communities. This example of communitarianism most frequently occurs with patients from outside the United States. Given the Western emphasis on autonomy, the best way to function with those patients displaying a communitarian ethic is to recognize this as their autonomous wish and to follow it. This means accepting the communitarian ethic of involving family in consultations and relying on senior or other family members for making decisions affecting the patient.",

They are not laws, but standards by which a resident physician may determine the propriety of his conduct in his relationship with patients, with colleagues, with members of allied professions, and with the public. 1. The principal objective of the medical profession is to render service to humanity with full respect to the dignity of man. Physicians should merit the confidence of patients entrusted to their care, rendering the full measure of service and devotion. 2. Physicians should strive continually to improve medical knowledge and skill, and should make available to their patients and colleagues the benefits of their professional attainments. 3. The medical profession should safeguard the public and itself against physicians deficient in moral character or professional competence. Physicians should observe all laws, uphold the dignity and honor of the profession, and accept its self-imposed disciplines. They should expose, without hesitation, illegal or unethical conduct of fellow members of the profession. 4. A physician should not dispose of his services under terms and conditions that tend to interfere with or impair the free and complete exercise of his/her judgment and skill, or tend to cause a deterioration of the quality of medical care. 5. A physician may not reveal the confidences entrusted to him in the course of medical attendance, or the deficiencies he may observe in the character of patients, unless he is required to do so by law or unless it becomes necessary to protect the welfare of the individual or of the community. 6. The honored ideals of the medical profession imply that the responsibilities of the physician extend not only to the individual but also to the society where these responsibilities deserve his interest and participation in activities that have the purpose of improving both the health and well-being of the individual and the community. recognizing bioethical issues and applying ethical principles and virtuous behavior is preparation for both their obvious and their subtler presentations. In the same way that physicians must prepare for other critical events encountered in medicine, physicians must read, discuss, and think about how to face these issues when they present.

The four roles that bioethics committees should perform are (1) concurrent case reviews (consultations), (2) retrospective case reviews, (3) policy development, and (4) education [54] . Not all committees are capable of performing all of these tasks. Some, however, are able to provide ''stat'' consultations for emergency medicine practitioners.",
