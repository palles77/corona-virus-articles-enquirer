FeLV infection remains an important cause of mortality in domestic cats through its ability to cause immune suppression, bone marrow disorders, and hematopoietic neoplasia. FeLV also causes disease in wild felids such as the highly endangered Iberian lynx. 2 FeLV infection progresses more rapidly than FIV infection and is more pathogenic, so most cats that develop progressive infections ultimately die of FeLV-related disease. However, in contrast to FIV infection, many cats in the early state of FeLV infection regress to a permanent state of viral latency (\"regressive infection\"). It is possible that some cats, after exposure to a low dose of FeLV, may eliminate the infection altogether (\"abortive infection\"), although this appears to be a rare outcome. Regardless, a positive test result for FeLV infection in an apparently healthy cat does not always imply that FeLV-related disease and mortality will occur.",

All cats infected with FeLV-B and FeLV-C are coinfected with FeLV-A, and only FeLV-A is transmitted between animals. FeLV-B and FeLV-C are more pathogenic than FeLV-A. FeLV-B arises through recombination of FeLV-A proviral DNA with endogenous FeLV sequences present in host cellular DNA. 3 FeLV-C arises from accumulation of mutations or insertions in the env (SU) gene of FeLV-A. 4, 5 The FeLV subtype influences the clinical expression of disease (see Table 22 -1). For example, FeLV-C is associated with nonregenerative anemia.

Adult cats are more likely to be infected with FeLV than cats aged less than 6 months, 13,17 but the median age of cats infected with FeLV is 3 years, 15 which is lower than that for FIV. This reflects a) the greater degree of pathogenicity of FeLV than FIV and its ability to significantly reduce lifespan; and b) the phenomenon of agerelated resistance to FeLV, whereby exposure of cats that are less than 4 months of age to the virus is much more likely to lead to progressive infection than exposure of adults. 21 When 12-to 16-week old kittens are exposed to a multicat household with endemic FeLV infection, between 60% and 70% of kittens will become infected within a 5-month time period. In contrast, less than 5% of cats aged 6 months or older will become infected over the same time period; over a 2-year period, 40% to 50% of these adult cats will become infected. Infection of adult cats can also still occur with exposure to high doses of the virus or when there is underlying host immune compromise.",

After oronasal exposure to the virus, the virus replicates in oral lymphoid tissue and then circulates in a few monocytes and lymphocytes within peripheral blood. Some cats develop systemic signs, such as fever, lethargy, and/or lymphadenopathy, during this period. A small number of infected lymphocytes then travel to the bone marrow, where the virus infects rapidly dividing precursor cells and subsequently lymphoid and epithelial cells throughout the body. This infection of the bone marrow is considered a critical step in the pathogenesis of FeLV infection. Once infection of epithelial cells in the salivary glands occurs, the virus is shed in massive quantities in saliva; low quantities of virus can also be shed in urine and feces.",

The immune system of some infected cats suppresses viral replication within a few weeks after infection, before significant infection of the marrow occurs. These cats develop a regressive infection, whereby proviral DNA is present in the host cell genome but production and shedding of virus no longer occurs (see Chapter 21) . This may occur after the initial period of viremia, or viremia may never be detectable. 22 Regressive infection can persist for life and may be reactivated with immunosuppression, such as might occur during pregnancy or following treatment with immunosuppressive drugs. 23 Later in life, an unknown percentage of cats with regressive infections may develop FeLV-negative malignancies as a result of integration of viral DNA within host cellular oncogenes. Most cats with regressive infection, however, never develop clinical signs related to FeLV infection. Viral genome sequences may eventually be incompletely replicated, and as a consequence, reactivation of virus replication will become impossible in some cats over time. In abortive infections, no viremia occurs after infection, and virus cannot be detected using any method. Cats with abortive infections have been exposed to low doses of FeLV, and although they fail to develop viremia, they will develop antibodies to the virus. 24 Some cats that never test antigenpositive may have focal infections, that is, evidence of proviral DNA in some tissues but not in blood or bone marrow. 9 Cats develop progressive infection once involvement of the marrow is established and cellular destruction by the virus exceeds the ability of the host's immune system to suppress viral replication.

The immunosuppressive properties of FeLV are not fully understood but have been linked in part to the viral envelope peptide, p15E, which inhibits T and B cell function, inhibits cytotoxic lymphocyte responses, alters monocyte morphology and distribution, and has been associated with impaired cytokine production and responsiveness. [25] [26] [27] [28] Kittens with progressive FeLV infection have impaired T cell and, to a lesser extent, B cell function. [29] [30] [31] [32] Infected cats may develop lymphopenia, thymic atrophy, and depletion of lymphocytes within lymph node paracortical zones. CD4+ T cell malfunction may contribute to a decreased humoral and cell-mediated immune response in affected cats, 33, 34 and the response to vaccination may also be impaired. Impaired neutrophil function compounds the effect of neutropenia in some infected cats. [35] [36] [37] Opportunistic infections that result include bacterial infections of the upper and lower urinary tract, hemoplasmosis, upper respiratory tract infections, feline infectious peritonitis, chronic stomatitis, toxoplasmosis, dermatophytosis, and cryptococcosis ( Figure 22-3 In the first week of infection, cats test negative with all antigen assays (i.e., p27 ELISA and IFA assays), RT-PCR for viral RNA, and PCR for proviral DNA. Rarely, cats exposed to low levels of virus eliminate the infection before or at this time point (abortive infection). Soluble antigen assays and proviral PCR assays become positive from about the third week after infection, and virus is shed in saliva, tears, urine, and feces. After this time point, productive viral infection is suppressed by the host immune response (regressive infection) or the virus multiplies rapidly in the bone marrow and a progressive infection occurs, which is characterized by persistently positive antigen ELISA, IFA, viral RNA, and proviral DNA assay results. Cats with focal or atypical infection are never or transiently antigen positive and test negative using PCR assays on blood or bone marrow, but some tissues (such as the mammary gland or bladder) are positive with proviral PCR. The latter occurs in only a small percentage (e.g., < 5%) of infected cats.

Cats infected with FeLV are more than 60-fold more likely to develop lymphoma than cats not infected with FeLV; this compares with approximately 5-fold for FIV. 40 Lymphoma or leukemia can be detected in nearly one quarter of cats with progressive FeLV infection at necropsy. 41 In the 1980s, as many as 70% of cases of feline lymphoma were associated with FeLV infection, but with improved control measures and vaccination, the vast majority of cats (more than 80% to 90%) seen at veterinary clinics with lymphoma now test negative for FeLV antigen. [42] [43] [44] The most common types of lymphoma in cats infected with FeLV are thymic (mediastinal), multicentric, spinal, renal, or ocular lymphoma. FeLV-associated lymphomas are mostly of T-cell origin, but B cell lymphoma can also occur. In contrast, FIV-associated lymphomas tend to be of B-cell origin. 42 Approximately 80% of cats with thymic lymphoma test positive for FeLV antigen, whereas fewer than 10% of cats with gastrointestinal lymphoma are FeLV antigen-positive. Large granular lymphoma is rarely associated with FeLV infection. 45 Cats with thymic lymphoma typically develop clinical signs of lethargy, tachypnea, and sometimes regurgitation. Most FeLV-positive cats with lymphoma are less than 4 years of age. 14 Cats with regressive infection appear to be at greater risk for development of lymphoma than cats that were never exposed to FeLV. FeLV-negative cats that live with cats that test positive for FeLV antigen have a more than 40-fold increased risk of lymphoma compared to that expected without exposure to FeLV. 46 Several studies have investigated the prevalence of FeLV proviral DNA in tumor cells from cats that test negative for FeLV antigen. Some studies (including more recent studies that used real-time PCR assays) found no evidence of FeLV proviral DNA in feline lymphomas. 14, 47, 48 In older studies that used conventional PCR, more than 20% of antigen-negative lymphomas tested positive. 49, 50 Additional studies from a variety of geographic locations that use multiple real-time PCR assays are required to clarify the role that FeLV plays in lymphomas and leukemias that develop in cats that test negative for FeLV antigen.",

These occur when FeLV-A recombines with cellular oncogenes (such as c-fes, c-fms, or c-fgr) to form feline sarcoma viruses (FeSV). These viruses then develop mutations in these oncogenes that, when reinserted into cellular DNA, cause malignant transformation. 53, 54 To replicate, FeSV requires the presence of FeLV-A, which supplies proteins such as those encoded by the env gene. Thus, all cats infected with FeSV test positive for FeLV antigen. FeSV-associated fibrosarcomas are characterized by multifocal, locally invasive, often ulcerated cutaneous masses that metastasize readily to the lung and other sites with a poor prognosis. FeLV-FeSV DNA sequences have been detected in some uveal melanomas from cats, 55 but other studies have failed to identify an association between FeSV and ocular melanomas or sarcomas in cats. 56, 57 FeLV infection does not appear to be important in the pathogenesis of solitary fibrosarcomas or injection-site sarcomas in cats. 58, 59 Other tumor types that are variably associated with FeLV infection are feline olfactory neuroblastomas, cutaneous horns, and osteochondromatosis (multiple cartilaginous exostoses). 60 Feline olfactory neuroblastomas are rare and aggressive tumors of the nasal cavity that can lead to signs of rhinosinusitis and neurologic signs. Osteochondromatosis is characterized by benign cartilage-capped exostotic growths that arise from the surface of a bone, which can cause pain, lameness, disfigurement, and paresis due to spinal cord compression.

Approximately 90% of FeLV-associated anemias are nonregenerative. 61 A variety of bone marrow disorders lead to decreased red blood cell production. FeLV-C infection results in pure red cell aplasia, a severe nonregenerative anemia associated with erythrocyte macrocytosis and depletion of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow. This occurs because FeLV-C binds to and interferes with a heme exporter protein, which results in subsequent heme toxicosis to the developing erythrocyte. 62 The presence of macrocytosis in the absence of reticulocytosis should thus raise suspicion for FeLV infection. FeLV infection can also lead to aplastic anemia in some cats, which is a deficiency in all cell lineages (platelets, myeloid, and erythroid) in the bone marrow, and replacement of the bone marrow space by adipose tissue. Anemia and bone marrow dysfunction may also result from myelophthisis secondary to leukemia, myeloid and/or erythroid dysplasia, or myelofibrosis (progressive replacement of the marrow with collagenous connective tissue) (Figure 22-4) .

FeLV infection underlies many myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and leukemia in cats. 63 However, over the past two decades, 50% of 28 cats with myelodysplasia and 44% of 41 cats with leukemia seen at the University of California, Davis, tested negative for FeLV antigen in peripheral blood, and only 36% of 34 cats with dysmyelopoiesis seen at the University of Minnesota were positive for FeLV antigen. 64 Several different classification systems have been used to describe feline MDS. 64 The French-American-British (FAB) classification scheme used for humans has been modified for dogs and cats. This divides MDS into 2 groups: 1) MDS with refractory cytopenia (less than 6% myeloblasts in the bone marrow, MDS-RC) and 2) MDS with excessive numbers of myeloblasts (6% to 30% myeloblasts, MDS-EB). The presence of more than 30% blasts indicates leukemia. The most common form of MDS in cats is MDS-EB. 64 Regressive FeLV infections have been detected by proviral DNA PCR in some cats with bone marrow disorders, 65 but the relationship between the presence of proviral DNA and the pathogenesis of disordered marrow function is unclear. Anemia in cats with FeLV infection may also result from anemia of inflammatory disease, which can be triggered by opportunistic infections or neoplastic disease. Erythrocyte destruction occurs in some FeLV-infected cats as a result of secondary immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) or coinfection with hemoplasmas (see Chapter 41) . Hemorrhage as a result of thrombocytopenia or defective platelet function may also contribute to anemia. Mechanisms of thrombocytopenia include immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) and bone marrow dysfunction. Similarly, neutropenia can result from myeloid hypoplasia, myelofibrosis, myelodysplasia, myelophthisis, or maturation arrest at the myelocyte or metamyelocyte stages. In some cases, peripheral neutropenia accompanied by myeloid hyperplasia reflects underlying immune-mediated neutropenia.",

The term soluble is used to distinguish these assays from assays such as IFA, which detect fixed antigen within cells. In most cats, the presence of circulating antigen correlates with viremia, although a few cats have viremia in the absence of detectable antigen or antigenemia in the absence of detectable viremia. 79 In-practice lateral flow assays are available that detect antigen in anticoagulated whole blood, plasma, or serum. In the past, the use of whole blood generated less reliable results than when plasma or serum was used, but with new-generation tests, whole blood is considered an acceptable alternative. 79 When a choice is available, serum is the preferred specimen. The use of tears or saliva is not recommended, because errors are more likely to occur. When virus isolation in culture was used as the gold standard, the sensitivity of seven different assays ranged from 92.1% to 96.8%, and the specificity ranged from 95.4% to 99.2%. 81 When ELISAs are used as screening tests, confirmation of positive test results is recommended because of the low prevalence of infection in healthy cats and the higher possibility that false-positive test results may occur. Positive test results in the absence of FeLV antigen have the potential to occur rarely as a result of operator error or nonspecific reactivity. 82 positive, progressive infection is likely. In some cats, antigenemia persists for 16 weeks before regression occurs, so the test could be repeated earlier than 6 months (e.g., 12 weeks later) or monthly if client finances permit so long as the cat remains healthy. \u2022 Perform a full CBC. If hematologic abnormalities are present, progressive infection is likely. Negative ELISA results can occur in the first month after exposure to FeLV, before sufficient antigen is detectable in the peripheral blood. Cats that test negative within 30 days of possible exposure to the virus should be retested 1 to 2 months later. Because development of antibodies to FIV can take up to 2 months, it is usually most practical to retest for both viral infections 2 months after possible exposure. Kittens can be tested at any time, because maternal antibody does not interfere with FeLV testing.",

            "text": "IFA assays are widely offered by veterinary diagnostic laboratories and can be performed on fresh peripheral blood or bone marrow. At least two fresh smears (without anticoagulant) should be air-dried and mailed to the laboratory. IFA is less sensitive than ELISA and, depending on the laboratory, is more prone to false-negative and false-positive results and so is not recommended for screening purposes. The presence of detectable virus using IFA in circulating blood cells indicates progressive infection more than 90% of the time. Cats with early viremia (before the bone marrow is infected) test IFA-negative but ELISA-positive. Cats with regressive infection test negative with both IFA and ELISA assays (see Figure 22 -2). Negative IFA test results can occur in cats with progressive infection when there are inadequate blood cells in the periphery, such as in neutropenic cats. Performing IFA on bone marrow rather than peripheral blood may help to overcome this problem. False-positive results can occur when inexperienced laboratory personnel interpret nonspecific fluorescence as a positive test result. They also have the potential to occur when the antibody conjugates bind nonspecifically to eosinophil granules, so eosinophils must be excluded in interpretation of fluorescing cells. 83 Some cats with clinical abnormalities that strongly suggest FeLV-related disease (such as leukemia or myelodysplasia) test negative for circulating antigen using ELISA but have bone marrow cells that test positive for FeLV antigen using IFA. For example, at the author's teaching hospital, 8 of 18 cats with leukemia or MDS that tested negative for soluble FeLV antigen had bone marrow smears that were positive using IFA; the remainder tested IFA negative. This phenomenon may reflect either false-positive IFA assay results, or true infection with undetectable levels of antigen in the peripheral blood. The use of PCR on bone marrow may help to resolve the FeLV status in at least some of these cats.",

At the current time, PCR assays should never be used in the absence of antigen testing in order to screen for or diagnose FeLV infection. The clinician needs to understand if the assay used detects proviral DNA, viral RNA, or both (some laboratories run both assays), because the clinical significance of a positive viral RNA assay (i.e., productive viral infection) differs from that of a positive proviral DNA assay (which suggests nonproductive viral infection for cats with negative antigen tests). After infection, RT-PCR assays may be positive several weeks before antigen tests or virus isolation become positive, 84 and depending on the assay, PCR for viral RNA can be more sensitive than soluble antigen tests. High viral RNA loads in blood and saliva appear to be associated with progressive infection, whereas low loads may be associated with regressive infection (Figure 22-7) . 84 PCR assays for proviral DNA can be used on blood, buffy coats, bone marrow, or tissues of cats that test negative for FeLV antigen. Cats with a positive proviral PCR test result but negative soluble antigen test, which in one study represented about 10% of cats with negative antigen test results, have regressive infection. 85, 86 These cats are probably not infectious to other cats but may reactivate virus shedding with severe stress or immunosuppression, or transmit the virus through blood transfusion or vertical transmission. Proviral DNA appears to be present at much lower levels in cats with regressive infection than in those with progressive infection. 86, 87 The cell types that contain FeLV proviral DNA also may differ for antigen-negative and antigen-positive cats. The proviral DNA of one FeLV strain was found only in the lymphocytes of antigen-negative cats, whereas antigen-positive cats had high loads within all leukocyte types, including lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes. 86, 87 The use of bone marrow or tissue specimens, rather than whole blood, may increase sensitivity for detection of proviral DNA.",

Antivirals that show promise for treatment of FeLV infection include fozivudine (which is closely related to AZT) and the integrase inhibitor raltegravir, which has been used to treat gammaretrovirus infections in humans and inhibits FeLV replication in cell culture. 94 The safety of these drugs in cats remains to be determined.",

The recombinant canarypox vaccine available in Europe is a different product than that licensed for use in the United States. Studies that have used highly sensitive PCR assays have shown that vaccination does not produce sterilizing immunity (that is, complete absence of viral RNA, DNA, antigenemia, and viremia after challenge). 98 In other words, cats develop regressive or even progressive infections, but not abortive infections after challenge. 98 Nevertheless, vaccination with recombinant subunit, canarypox vectored, and whole virus vaccine prevented progressive infection in 87%, 78%, and 44% of cats when compared with controls, respectively. One vaccine protected 83% of cats against antigenemia after challenge as long as 2 years after vaccination. 99 In summary, no vaccine provides 100% protection against FeLV infection, and even when protection against progressive infection occurs, regressive infections still occur. However, because vaccination protects cats from progressive infection, it is indicated for all at-risk cats, such as those with outdoor exposure or those that reside in households with other FeLV antigenpositive cats. The American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) highly recommends that all FeLV antigen-negative kittens be vaccinated for FeLV, because of the potential that some of these kittens may escape or become outdoor cats, even when the intention of the owner is to keep the kitten indoors. 100 Vaccination is also recommended for cats entering shelters that are likely to be housed with other cats. 79 Two doses are given in the left pelvic limb as distally as possible, 3 to 4 weeks apart from 8 to 9 weeks of age, followed by a booster at 1 year and then every 1 to 3 years thereafter, although more information is required on the duration of immunity for FeLV vaccines. The European Advisory Bureau on Cat Diseases (ABCD) suggests a booster every 2 to 3 years for cats older than 3 to 4 years of age, in light of the lower susceptibility of adult cats to infection. 101 Annual boosters are required for recombinant vaccines. Acutely ill cats should not be vaccinated, but it is acceptable to vaccinate cats with chronic diseases, such as chronic kidney disease. Testing for FeLV should be performed before each booster if exposure to FeLV was likely before the booster was required (which should apply for most cats vaccinated for FeLV). Vaccination with FeLV vaccines has been associated with injectionsite sarcomas, so only cats that are likely to be exposed should be vaccinated. ",

Routine hand-washing precautions are indicated for hospitalized cats, and precautions should be taken (such as the wearing of gloves) to protect FeLV-infected cats from nosocomial pathogens. Fomites such as food and water bowls and litter boxes should not be shared between FeLV antigen-negative cats and cats with unknown or antigen-positive FeLV status. Neutering can prevent roaming and reduce the likelihood of FeLV infection. When a cat from a multicat household tests antigen-positive, all cats should be tested and retested and positive cats should be separated from other cats if possible. Euthanasia is recommended for sick, FeLV-positive cats that enter shelters.101 People who adopt cats that have unknown retrovirus status from shelters should be educated about the disease and the need for quarantine and testing after adoption.",
