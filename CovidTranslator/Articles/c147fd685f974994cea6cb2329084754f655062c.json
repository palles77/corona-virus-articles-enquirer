Routine cloning of large genome fractions or whole genomes from these organisms would significantly enhance their discovery and genetic and functional characterization. Here we report the cloning of whole bacterial genomes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as single-DNA molecules. We cloned the genomes of Mycoplasma genitalium (0.6 Mb), M. pneumoniae (0.8 Mb) and M. mycoides subspecies capri (1.1 Mb) as yeast circular centromeric plasmids. These genomes appear to be stably maintained in a host that has efficient, well-established methods for DNA manipulation.",

Recently, there has been increasing interest in cloning much larger pieces of DNA, including whole genomes. For example, several organelle genomes have been cloned. The 16-kb mouse mitochondrial genome has been cloned in Escherichia coli (1, 2) , Bacillus subtilis (1,3) and yeast (4) . The 139-kb maize chloroplast genome has been cloned in yeast (5) , and the 135-kb rice chloroplast genome has been cloned in B. subtilis (1) . Viral genomes have been cloned in E. coli, including those from a number of herpesviruses (6) as well as baculoviruses (7) (8) (9) , coronaviruses (10) and a poxvirus (11) . A 36-kb human adenovirus type 2 genome (12) and a 178-kb fragment of the human cytomegalovirus genome (13) have been cloned in yeast. As for bacteria, $10% of the 1.8-Mb Haemophilus influenzae genome has been cloned as two separate episomal elements in E. coli (14) . The 3.5-Mb Synechocystis PCC6803 genome was inserted in three discontiguous regions into the B. subtilis genome, with the exception of the two ribosomal RNA operons (15) . We have reported the cloning of a completely synthetic 0.6-Mb Mycoplasma genitalium genome in yeast as a circular yeast centromeric plasmid (YCp) (16, 17) . We have also reported the cloning of the natural 1.1-Mb genome isolated from M. mycoides subspecies capri in yeast as a YCp (18) .",

The sequence has been deposited in GenBank with the *To whom correspondence should be addressed. Tel: +1 858 200 1818; Fax: +1 858 200 1881; Email: gbenders@jcvi.org accession number GU593054. Primers (IDT) and templates used for the construction are outlined in Supplementary Table S1. Ten nanograms of plasmid was used as template in a 100-ml polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Phusion DNA polymerase and HF buffer (NEB), according to the manufacturer's protocol, except that extra magnesium chloride (MgCl 2 ) was added for a final concentration of 2 or 3 mM. Cycling conditions were as follows: 98 C for 30 s, followed by 30 cycles of 98 C for 10 s, 46-59 C (cycles 1-5) or 51-64 C (cycles 6-30) for 30 s and 72 C for 90 s, followed by 72 C for 5 min. Specific annealing temperatures ( C) for PCR cycles 1-5 were as follows: bla (ampicillin resistance) and pUC19 origin, 56 and 59; lacZ, 46 and 48; tetM, 46 and 50; transposase, 46; HIS3 and ARSH4-CEN6, 48 and 52. Annealing temperatures for cycles 6-30 were 5 C higher. PCR products of each amplicon were pooled and each amplicon was gel purified and recovered using b-agarase (NEB). The transposase was initially hard to amplify from the template pISM31.1, possibly because one of the PCR primers used contained not only 20 bp of homology to the template at the desired location, but also 26 bp of homology to two copies of the IS256 inverted repeat present in other parts of the plasmid. These IS256 copies were separated from the desired template portion of pISM31.1 with a double digest with PciI and SalI, followed by gel-purification and use of the 3.7-kb fragment. The entire CBA reaction was repaired (16) , then phenol extracted, isopropanol precipitated, resuspended and electroporated into EPI300 cells (Epicentre). Transformants were selected for carbenicillin resistance. Clones were screened for size by three separate restriction digests, but the plasmid was not sequenced. Instead, its elements were tested phenotypically. Propagation in E. coli ensured functionality of the pUC19 origin, while selection in E. coli with carbenicillin and tetracycline and screening with X-gal tested the intactness of the bla, tetM and lacZ markers. Successful transformation of yeast showed that the HIS3, ARSH4 and CEN6 markers were viable. Function of the transposon was tested by transformation into mycoplasma.",

The template for this was a construct we had made previously, which was generated as follows. We modified a yeast clone of a synthetic M. genitalium genome, sMgTARBAC37 (16), by integrating a 1.5-kb DNA fragment containing URA3 and the GAL1 promoter near the centromere in the clone's vector. The 1.5-kb fragment was generated using the PCR-based fusion method (34) to join together two overlapping PCR products.

The approach of Figure 1B does not require transformation or even cultivation of the organism, just intact genomic DNA. This method is favored for genetically intractable or uncultured organisms. These may include pathogens and environmental isolates. However, this strategy does not guarantee fitness or viability of the cloned genome. In addition, it may be difficult to find a suitable restriction site for vector insertion, and vector insertion may require some sequence knowledge. The approach of Figure 1C is useful for assembling pieces of DNA, both natural and synthetic.

Selection in liquid culture took several weeks less than plating the transformation mixture and then expanding the resulting individual colonies in liquid medium. When analyzed by Clones were pre-electrophoresed at constant voltage, then left unheated (\u00c0) or incubated at 55 C for 1 h for linearization (+). The genomes are too large to move into the gel as circles; they must be linearized to migrate. restriction digestion, the pool of transformants gave discrete bands whose sizes summed to one M. pneumoniae genome ( Figure 3M, label 'Mp' ). This indicated a predominant vector insertion site. Direct genomic sequencing with primers internal to the vector was unsuccessful. Thus, DNA from the pool was electroporated into E. coli. Incubation of transformants with kanamycin selected circularized M. pneumoniae fragments that contained the vector, which included BAC sequences. Plasmid DNA from one such transformant was isolated and sequenced. It contained insertion of the vector by transposition within MPN028, after the base pair corresponding to 33901 in the M. pneumoniae M129 sequence (GenBank accession U00089), with a duplication of bp 33893-33901. This gene has been shown to be nonessential in M. genitalium, but not in M. pneumoniae. However, the vector insertion occurred near the 3 0 -end of the gene, which may not be disruptive to gene function (44, 45) . The restriction map produced by vector insertion at this location matched our results. This genome was named YCpMpn028 ( Figure 2E ).",

Data from five experiments showed that approximately half (range: 35-61%) of the clones were correct by the two assays used (Table 1 ; percentage of clones complete by PCR multiplied by percentage of those clones correct by size). PCR analysis of the remaining clones showed that most contained some mycoplasma DNA. We do not know how these incomplete clones arose. One or more genome fragments may transform yeast and be circularized in the process by yeast repair mechanisms. Alternatively, these incomplete clones may have arisen from recombination in yeast during the process of transformation with a complete mycoplasma genome.",

Three to eight colonies from this plate (subclones) were individually selected and cultured to saturation in several milliliters of selective medium. DNA from each was isolated and clones were examined for size by restriction digestion followed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and, in some cases, Southern blot. Three out of three YCpMmyc1.1 yeast clones were stable by this analysis ( Figure 3H ). All 21 synthetic M. genitalium yeast clones (16) examined were also stable.",

This contrasts with the approach of assembling multiple smaller fragments into a genome, which is a strategy that others have used in attempting to clone the entire Synechocystis (15) and E. coli (14) genomes. Cloning a genome by building it from smaller pieces can take a significant number of steps, depending upon how many pieces can be assembled at once.",

There is no restriction barrier in yeast (59) . Gene toxicity is minimized because regulation of gene expression in a eukaryote such as yeast is different from that in prokaryotes. The transcription (60) and translation (61) signals in yeast are different from those in bacteria. In addition, mycoplasmas use the codon UGA for tryptophan rather than as a translation stop signal. Thus, most mycoplasma genes, if expressed, would produce truncated proteins in yeast. This largely avoids the possibility of toxic gene products.",

We have been able to transplant several variations of an M. mycoides genome from yeast. This shows that yeast has propagated several different M. mycoides genomes with enough fidelity that they are functional. We sequenced a genome from M. mycoides cells that was transplanted out of yeast, and aside from changes that we had engineered in yeast, it contained the same sequence as the molecule that was cloned into yeast (18) .

(B) Alternatively, they can be inserted by cotransformation of yeast with the vector and the bacterial genome. In this case the two must share overlapping sequences, so that yeast can combine them by homologous recombination.

Mycoplasma sequence is black. Gel analysis of whole mycoplasma genome clones in yeast. The host yeast strain of each set of clones is marked above the gel. Clones were first assayed for completeness by multiplex PCR (B, D, G, I, L). Complete clones are marked with an asterisk, and those selected for sizing by restriction digestion and gel electrophoresis (C, E, H, J, M) are highlighted in yellow. Clones judged to be the correct size are marked with a caret. L is a 100-bp ladder (Invitrogen), is a lambda ladder (NEB) and LR is the Low Range PFG ladder (NEB); selected bands are labeled. (A) Map of the M. genitalium YCpMgen16-2 genome. The location of the yeast vector insertion is marked. Bars indicate position and numbers indicate size of PCR amplicons. Restriction fragments are numbered and their sizes given in red or blue. (B) Multiplex PCR analysis of 24 yeast clones derived from YCpMgen16-2, using primers shown in (A). (C) Selected clones assayed as correct in (B) digested with EagI (top gel) or BssHII (bottom gel) and separated by field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE). Yeast chromosomal DNA was removed prior to this analysis by digestion with FseI, RsrII, and AsiSI, followed by constant voltage electrophoresis (these enzymes do not have recognition sites in YCpMgen16-2 and large circular DNA molecules remained in the agarose plugs under these conditions). (D) Multiplex PCR analysis of eight yeast clones derived from YCpMgen16-2, using primers shown in (A). sMgTARBAC37 (c1) (16) and M. genitalium (c2) DNAs were used as positive controls. (E) All clones assayed as correct in (D) linearized with EagI and separated by clamped homogenous electric field (CHEF). Before digestion, clones were pre-electrophoresed at constant voltage to remove linear yeast chromosomes. 'Mg' indicates NotI-digested 592-kb sMgTARBAC37 (16). Clone 6 contains a faint extra band of $300 kb. (F) Map of the M. mycoides YCpMmyc1.1 genome. The location of the yeast vector insertion is marked. Arrowheads represent IS1296 elements. Bars indicate position and numbers indicate size of PCR amplicons. Restriction fragments are numbered and their sizes given in red. (G) Multiplex PCR analysis of 48 yeast clones derived from YCpMmyc1.1, using primers shown in (F). An additional amplicon of 464 bp, not shown in (F), acted as a positive control by amplifying yeast rDNA. (H) Selected yeast clones assayed as correct in (G) digested with BssHII and separated by CHEF. The parent clone (far left in each set) and 3-4 subclones of each were analyzed. Markers and controls are: (1) Low Range PFG Marker (NEB); (2) S. cerevisiae marker (Bio-Rad); VL6-48N (3) undigested and (4) BssHII-digested; and YCpMmyc1.1 (5) undigested and (6) BssHII-digested. (I) Multiplex PCR analysis of 15 yeast clones derived from YCpMmyc1.1, using primers shown in (F). (J) All clones assayed as correct in (I) pre-electrophoresed at constant voltage to remove linear yeast chromosomes, then left undigested (\u00c0) or digested (+) with BssHII and separated by CHEF. 'C' indicates YCpMmyc1.1 DNA isolated from M. mycoides used as a positive control. (K) Map of the M. pneumoniae YCpMpn028 genome. The location of the yeast vector insertion is marked. Bars indicate position and numbers indicate size of PCR amplicons. Restriction fragments are numbered and their sizes given in red or blue. (L) Multiplex PCR analysis of 20 yeast clones derived from YCpMpn028, using primers shown in (K). (M) Selected clones assayed as correct in (L) pre-electrophoresed at constant voltage, then digested with NotI (top gel) or SbfI (bottom gel) and separated by CHEF. Host yeast strain VL6-48N is labeled 'Y' and M. pneumoniae DNA transformed into yeast is labeled 'Mp'. A red asterisk marks incomplete digestion (linearization) of the yeast clone. (N) A haploid yeast strain containing an M. genitalium genome and a haploid yeast strain containing an M. mycoides genome are compared to a diploid yeast clone containing the two mycoplasma genomes.",
