While the achievement is widely recognized, it is still largely unexplored why China was able to attain it within a short period. This study aims to fill the gap. Through a systematic political and socio-economic analysis, it identifies seven major drivers for China's success, including (1) the SARS outbreak as a wake-up call, (2) strong public support for government intervention in health care, (3) renewed political commitment from top leaders, (4) heavy government subsidies, (5) fiscal capacity backed by China's economic power, (6) financial and political responsibilities delegated to local governments and (7) programmatic implementation strategy. Three of the factors seem to be unique to China (i.e., the SARS outbreak, the delegation, and the programmatic strategy.) while the other factors are commonly found in other countries' insurance expansion experiences. This study also discusses challenges and recommendations for China's health financing, such as reducing financial risk as an immediate task, equalizing benefit across insurance programs as a long-term goal, improving quality by tying provider payment to performance, and controlling costs through coordinated reform initiatives. Finally, it draws lessons for other developing countries.",

The achievement also drew attention of the mass media [3] . While China's success in coverage expansion is widely recognized, few studies have systematically examined reasons for the success. This study aims to fill the gap. The study findings will help answer three questions that are of interest to policymakers and researchers both within and without China: To analyze these questions, this study drew data from public sources. It searched the PubMed (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) for journal articles published in English language, the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (http://www.cnki.net/) for journal articles published in Chinese language, and the Internet for mass media reports and government documents. Using the data, this paper first briefly summarizes China's achievement. Then it analyzes major drivers for the achievement before discussing policy challenges and recommendations. Finally it summarizes the lessons from China's experience.",

While the past three decades have witnessed China's economic take-off, the country's health care system has not kept pace with the economic development [5, 6] . As government officials became increasingly occupied by economic development, government health expenditures dropped from 37% of total health expenditures in 1980 to 18% in 2004 [7] . The economic reform also unexpectedly led to serious deterioration in insurance coverage [8, 9] , with insurance rate falling to 5% and 38% in rural and urban areas respectively in 1998 [4, 10] . Many researchers were alarmed by the falling coverage, and some researchers started experimental studies in the 1990s in an effort to rebuild the health insurance system, especially in rural China [11] [12] [13] . While the studies produced a wealth of experience that was eventually drawn on by Chinese policymakers, the studies did not lead to immediate policy actions, especially at the national level. At the turn of the 21st century, deteriorating insurance coverage coupled with a rapid increase in health care costs pushed health care affordability to the top of the list of public's concerns [14] .",

Consequently, it served as a wake-up call to Chinese leaders, who recognized how underinvestment in the 1980s-1990s had led the health care system to be unprepared for an emergency [18] . Within several months of the SARS outbreak, Chinese leaders decided on massive investment in the public health system [12] , including heavy subsidies for the nation-wide implementation of NRCMS, which marked a new era of health care financing in China.",

For example, the barefoot doctor system in rural China, which was once praised by WHO as a successful example of providing health care services in developing countries [25, 26] , declined rapidly after China's economic reform started in 1978 because it no longer enjoyed political backing from the central government and financial support from local governments and communities [27] . By the late 1980s, barefoot doctors either became private practitioners or Cooperative Medical Scheme appearing in rural areas as a prepayment health plan organized at the village level, and financed jointly by village collective fund, upper level government subsidies, and premium paid by farmers.",

As another example, although 95% of hospital are owned by the governments, public funding is approximately 10% of hospital revenue [28] . To make a profit, hospitals heavily relied on overprescribing drugs and diagnostic tests [29] [30] [31] . As a result, drug spending was about half of China's health expenditures, one of the highest shares in the world [32] . The privatization-induced overuse exacerbated the problem of health care affordability [33] . The public's concern with health care privatization is also due to a serious side-effect of China's market-oriented economic reform, which caused millions of employees to lose their jobs in the 1990s [34] . For the unemployed, the terms of market-orientation and privatization inflict painful memories, including their losing health insurance coverage [34, 35] . To correct the so-called \"market failures\", many researchers proposed for stronger government intervention in the health sector [36] . As a counterargument, several researchers who noted that the limited market mechanism ambiguously defined by the governments has distorted the health care system called for market-oriented reform [21, 37] . Because it was not well received by government officials [38] , the counterargument was barely discussed in the 2009 national health care reform plan [39] .",

After releasing the reform plan in 2009, the central government formally reasserted its role in health care with unprecedented funding of 850 billion Chinese Yuan (about US$124 billion) for five reform programs-expanding coverage, establishing a national essential drug list, improving primary care, promoting equal access to public health services and piloting public hospital reform programs [41, 42] . There are two political reasons behind the renewed government support. First, contrary to a misunderstanding by many observers [43] , socialism remains China's official ideology, obligating its governments to improve its people's social well-being, including health care. The obligation may not be fulfilled for some time (e.g., in the 1980s-1990s when the governments focused on improving economic indicators), but it cannot be completely ignored by the governments as long as the state ideology remains unchanged [43] . The historical success in the 1960s-1970s when China was praised as an innovator in health care by the World Health Organization [20, 44] , also reinforced the obligation in the 2000s after the 30-year economic growth. Thus, in 2004, Chinese leaders announced NRCMS as an integral part of their efforts to build the \"new socialist countryside\", an initiative to boost rural development [33] . The fact that NRCMS, a health insurance program, carries the socialist label illustrates the impact of state ideology on contemporary Chinese society [40, 45] .",

For example, the reimbursement rate of inpatient care was relatively low in 2011, ranging from 44 to 68% among the three public insurance programs, all of which left the insured to bear a relatively large share of the burden of inpatient care. The low benefit level was a direct result of the modest premiums. Table 2 shows that the annual premium was only US$24 and US$21 for NRCMS and URBMI, respectively, both of which were too low to offer any generous benefit coverage. Not surprisingly, the published evidence is equivocal about whether China's coverage expansion reduced patients' financial risk [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . At the national level, the proportion of out-of-pocket expenditures to total national health expenditures was significantly reduced from 60% in 2001 to 35% in 2011 (Fig. 1) . However, the proportion was still higher than the average level of 33% among the group of upper-middle-income countries, to which China belongs [1] . 46 51 53 55 56 59 60 58 56 54 52 49 44 40 37 China's Minister of Health publicly acknowledged that the financial risk remained high in the context of universal health insurance coverage [54] . To address the issue, the government has raised the ceiling of public insurance reimbursement with the goal of reducing out-of-pocket payment to 30% of total health expenditures by 2018. China's efforts of financial risk reduction can be more effective through reinsurance plans as discussed below.",

MOPH planned to set up a new registration system by 2020 to eliminate the discrimination again rural residents [57] . It might not be possible to equalize the benefit coverage across insurance programs until the new registration system is established.

Although they work and live in cities, the migrant workers are still listed as rural population in the current household registration system, and consequently they are enrolled in their hometowns' NRCMS. Such arrangements caused two problems. (1) Most migrant workers cannot afford for health care in cities since the NRCMS benefit coverage is lower than the URBMI or UEBMI. (2) Those workers who seek health care in cities have to go back to their hometowns to get reimbursement. Several cities have piloted programs to allow migrant workers to enroll in URBMI or UEBMI.

They need to do more to control health care costs, especially through coordination between the insurance reform and other reform initiatives. For example, after China's success in insurance expansion, a large share of hospital revenues came from user charges that the three public insurance programs reimbursed. The policymakers may want to use the large amounts of insurance reimbursement as a useful tool for the ongoing hospital reform initiative to push hospitals for improving quality of care, reducing waste and inefficiency, and controlling growth of health expenditures. One option is to tie the insurance programs' reimbursement to hospital performance in improving quality and reducing waste and inefficiency as discussed above. Another option is to reform the insurance programs' provider reimbursement systems by replacing the fee-for-service payment method with prospective methods, such as capitation payment to primary care physicians, diagnosis-groupadjusted payment to hospitals, and bundled payment. As indicated by prior research [2] , the policymakers may want to ensure that all the three insurance programs use the same payment method and that providers do not compromise quality of care to reduce costs under the new method.",

However, the central government has not yet defined clearly the role for private insurance to play in China's health financing system. Without a clearly defined role, developing private insurance in China might raise concerns about inequality given prior study findings of negative impacts of supplemental private insurance on health care outcomes in countries with universal health insurance coverage [61, 62] . China's efforts to develop private insurance can be strengthened by (1) requiring the three public insurance programs to work with private insurance companies on reinsurance plans to mitigate the financial risk of the publicly insured and (2) investing in the country's health information system and training of health insurance experts, both of which will enable private insurers to differentiate their products to meet the consumers' diverse needs, rather than to engage in the current price competition on similar portfolios [63] .",

First, China joined a group of countries (e.g., Japan and Korea) that achieved universal health insurance coverage before becoming high-income countries [68] . The significance of China's experience is that it reached universal coverage during its process of industrialization and urbanization, setting an encouraging example for other countries involved in similar processes.",

Such a combination strategy can be helpful for them to design coverage expansion options that are socio-politically feasible in their national contexts.",
