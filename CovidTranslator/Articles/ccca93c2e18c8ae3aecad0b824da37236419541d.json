Ammonium chloride, amantadine, chlorpheniramine and procaine inhibited JV production. The action of ammonium chloride was exerted at early times of infection. Virus internalization was inhibited and viral protein expression was not detected. When the extracellular medium was buffered at low pH, the ammonium chloride induced block on JV infection was overcome. Furthermore, JV was able to induce fusion of infected cells at pH 5.5 leading to polykaryoctye formation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that JV entry occurs through an endocytic mechanism requiring a low pH dependent membrane fusion.",

The endocytosed virions travel to intracellular compartments where acidic conditions facilitate fusion between the viral envelope and the vesicle membrane releasing the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. Thus, lysosomotropic agents such as weak bases and carboxylic ionophores that elevate the pH of acidic organelles, interfere with the virion uncoating and inhibit the replication [1, 9, 14] . The uncharged form of any weak base has been proposed to enter the acidic intracellular compartments very efficiently, raising the pH as it becomes protonated and inhibiting hydrolytic enzymes [15] .",

In the presence of ammonium chloride there was no virus internalization and a progressive decrease is observed in the number of infectious centers.

In the absence of ammonium chloride, infectivity of JV was not affected at the pH range assayed (5.5-7.5) (data not shown). A high degree of inhibition was observed when cultures were incubated in medium containing ammonium chloride at pH 7.5, 6.6 and 6.3 during 3 h, while there was only 31.5 and 22.3 % inhibition at pH 6.t and 5.8, respectively (Fig. 5) . At more acidic pH values the action of ammonium chloride was almost totally abolished. To assess that the acid pH is modifying the mechanism of viral entry and is not just neutralizing the ammonium chloride, JV bound cells were briefly treated with medium buffered at different pH for 2 min and then incubated for 3 h in neutral medium containing or not ammonium chloride. This treatment prevents endocytosis by inhibiting release into the cytoplasm of virus entered in endocytic vacuoles and allows virus entry only by fusion at the plasma membrane [26] . Under these experimental conditions, ammonium chloride inhibition was partially reversed at pH 5.5 (Fig. 5 ).",

In fact, a bypass of the ammonium chloride block of JV infection was achieved when the extracellular medium was at a pH below 6.1 (Fig. 5) , suggesting that the acidic conditions would probably trigger direct fusion of virus envelope with the cell membrane. The location of penetration is determined by the pH threshold of fusion activity [15] . For some viruses such as Semliki Forest virus, fusion occurs at a pH 6.2 in early endosomes, whereas Influenza virus X-31 requires pH 5.3 and fuses in the late endosomes [12, 24, 25] . For JV entry, fusion seems to occur in endosomes where the pH is 6.1 or lower. The acid environment may be responsible for structural changes in JV external proteins allowing membrane fusion and facilitating viral uncoating as described for Influenza virus [7], Rubella virus [17] , West Nile virus [13] and tick-borne encephalitis virus [11] .",

We demonstrated that Junin virus can mediate cell fusion at pH 5.5 producing polykaryocytes in which over 40% of the cells in the monolayer participate (Fig. 6) . Thus, this result offers indirect support for the conclusion that the route of JV entry is pH-dependent in Vero cells. Major expression of GP38, the main external envelope glycoprotein [19] , was observed in the surface of JV infected cells at 48 h p.i., by immunofluorescence assay (data not shown). Thus, GP38 might be responsible for JV-induced membrane fusion in the endosome or in the cell surface. This proposal is also supported by results obtained with C167, a host-range mutant of JV, with an alteration in GP38 detected by peptide mapping and a blockade in adsorption-penetration pathway [21, 22] .",

Previously the lack of toxicity of the four bases for Vero cells was investigated by assessing their effects on cell growth (Fig. 1). The highest noncytotoxic concentrations were 20 m M for a m m o n i u m chloride, 0.6 m M for amantadine and chlorpheniramine, and 3 m M for procaine. As seen in Fig. 1 JV infection was inhibited by the drugs in a dose-dependent manner. The most active c o m p o u n d in the range of noncytotoxic concentrations assayed was a m m o n i u m chloride which reduced JV yield m o r e than 3 log units, thus it was chosen for the next experiments. The presence of the c o m p o u n d s at the concentrations used did n o t affect either the p H of the culture m e d i u m or the infectivity of JV particles (data not shown)Dose-dependent inhibition of JV infection by lysosomotropic compounds. Vero cell monolayers were incubated in the presence of different concentrations of ammonium chloride (A), procaine (B), amantadine (C), and chlorpheniramine (D). After 24h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C the number of viable cells was determined by the Trypan blue exclusion method (-A ). Other set of cultures were infected with JV (moi 1) in the presence of noncytotoxic concentrations of the compounds. The drugs were maintained for 24 h, supernatants were then harvested and viral titers were determined ( Z]-)",
