In this review, we describe several diverse plant systems that have been developed to produce commercially useful proteins for pharmaceutical and industrial uses. The advantages and disadvantages of each system are discussed. The first plant-derived molecular farming products have reached the marketplace and other products are poised to join them during the next few years. We explain the rationale for using plants as biofactories. We also describe the products currently on the market, and those that appear likely to join them in the near future. Lastly, we discuss the issue of public acceptance of molecular farming products.",

Thus, long-term non-refrigerated storage of the seed, if properly carried out, can allow the protein to exist without degradation for at least 2 years. This seed can then be transported to its final destination without refrigeration. Another advantage to this system is that large acreage can be utilized with the lowest possible cost.

The protein is composed of four identical subunits, each 128 amino acids long. The usual source for commercial quantities of avidin is from chicken egg white but the resultant product is relatively expensive due to the cost of maintaining live animals. Hood et al. (1997) reported the production of chicken egg white avidin in transgenic corn using an avidin gene whose sequence had been optimized for expression in corn. The resultant avidin had properties almost identical to those of avidin from chicken egg white. The pI, K i , and antigenic properties were identical. Both the corn-derived and the chicken egg-derived avidin were glycosylated. While the avidin apoproteins were identical, the size of corn-derived avidin was slightly less than chicken egg-derived avidin (16.8 vs 17.6 kDa) due to a less complex glycosylation composition (M. Bailey, unpublished observations) . This difference did not alter the binding activity of the mature protein. Corn-derived avidin expression levels over 20% TSP (total soluble protein) have been observed (Masarik et al. 2003) . Processing methodologies were developed to extract and purify this novel product from transgenic corn ). This product is currently being sold by Sigma-Aldrich (#A8706; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,",

The molecular weights were identical, as were their antigenic qualities K i and pI. Their K m values were nearly identical (0.20 vs 0.21) and their V max values for the substrate MUG (4-methylumbelliferyl-b-d-glucuronide) were also quite similar (2.910 5 nM/h for corn-derived vs 2.210 5 nM/h for E. coli-derived). The sequences of the two genes were similar, with the exception of the most Nterminal amino acid. It was surmised that removal of the terminal amino acid in plants was a result of the Nterminal rule in action (Hirel et al. 1989 ) as a result of the change in sequence.

Collagen is a structural protein currently rendered from hooves and connective tissue of animals. Vast quantities of collagen are consumed throughout the world each year in the form of gelatin. Based on their structural roles and compatibility within the body, collagen and gelatin are commonly used biomaterials in the medical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Collagen is used commercially in the areas of arterial sealants, bone grafts, corneal implants, drug delivery, incontinence, tissue engineering (artificial skin and cartilage), and as a viscoelastic supplement. Gelatin is used in the stabilization and delivery of vaccines and drugs, in capsules and soft gels, nutraceuticals, and as plasma expanders. The first report of human collagen produced in plants was by Ruggiero et al. (2000) . The authors inserted the fibrillar collagen cDNAs 1a3 and a22, which together code for the complete human proa1(I) collagen chain, into tobacco using Agrobacterium, and npt2 as the selectable marker gene. The resultant protein was organized into a triple helix, which was somewhat surprising since plants do not contain the specific post-translational machinery needed for collagen assembly (Ruggiero et al. 2000) . Currently several companies have reported interest in bringing human collagen to market (Table 2) .",

Vaccines administered using needles (parenteral delivery) do not usually give a good immune response in the mucosal tissues of the vaccine recipient. Mucosal surfaces such as the mouth and the urogenital tract are the primary ports of entry of most disease organisms. Edible vaccines have been shown to induce excellent mucosal immune responses. Recent reviews of edible vaccines include Carter and Langridge (2002) and . The laboratory of William Langridge at Loma Linda University (Loma Linda, Calif.) has been active in developing edible vaccines against diabetes and cholera using a flexible hinge peptide between the antigens and the protein adjuvants in order to minimize stearic hindrance (Arakawa et al. 1998 (Arakawa et al. , 2001 Yu and Langridge 2001) . Korban and colleagues at the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign, Ill.) have reported a plant-based oral vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in tomato fruit (Korban et al. 2002) with the ultimate aim of moving the product into apple. HSV is a viral pathogen that causes respiratory diseases and is a leading cause of viral lower respiratory tract illness in infants and children worldwide.",

A human phase I clinical trial was recently completed with our corn-based LT-B vaccine candidate (Tacket et al. 2003) .
