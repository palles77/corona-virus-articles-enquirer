            "text": "Given that local cell-mediated immunity (CMI) against the human papillomavirus type 16 E6 (HPV16 E6) protein is important for eradication of HPV16 E6-expressing cancer cells in the cervical mucosa, the HPV16 E6 protein may be a target for the mucosal immunotherapy of cervical cancer. Here, we expressed the HPV16 E6 antigen on Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) and investigated E6-specific CMI following oral administration of the L. casei-PgsA-E6 to mice. Surface expression of HPV16 E6 antigens was confirmed and mice were orally inoculated with the L. casei-PgsA or the L. casei-PgsA-E6. Compared to the L. casei-PgsA-treated mice, significantly higher levels of serum IgG and mucosal IgA were observed in L. casei-PgsA-E6-immunized mice; these differences were significantly enhanced after boost. Consistent with this, systemic and local CMI were significantly increased after the boost, as shown by increased counts of IFN-c-secreting cells in splenocytes, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), and vaginal samples. Furthermore, in the TC-1 tumor model, animals receiving the orally administered L. casei-PgsA-E6 showed reduced tumor size and increased survival rate versus mice receiving control (L. casei-PgsA) immunization. We also found that L. casei-PgsA-E6-induced antitumor effect was decreased by in vivo depletion of CD4 ? or CD8 ? T cells. Collectively, these results indicate that the oral administration of lactobacilli bearing the surface-displayed E6 protein induces T cell-mediated cellular immunity and antitumor effects in mice.",

More than 100 HPV genotypes have been identified [5] , but the HPV type 16 (HPV16) has been associated with more than 50% of the HPV-related cervical cancer cases studied [6] [7] [8] . The E6 protein physically interacts with p53, leading to its dysfunction, while the E7 protein binds to the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and activates cell cycleassociated genes [9] [10] [11] . Because the E6 and E7 proteins are consistently expressed in cervical cancer cells [12] , these two oncoproteins represent attractive targets for developing vaccines and immunotherapeutic strategies against HPV-associated diseases. Recently, Nakagawa et al. [13] [14] [15] demonstrated the presence of E6-specific memory T cells in women whose HPV infection had been cleared and concluded that the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to HPV16 E6 antigens was more important than that to E7 antigens for controlling HPV16 infection. Thus, E6-specific CTL activity may be a major immune response for controlling persistent HPV16 infection.",

            "text": "Because HPV infects the epithelium of the lower female genital tract, where it can lead to cervical carcinoma [16] , one strategy against cervical cancer might be to induce effective mucosal immunity with an aim toward inhibiting genital HPV transmission/infection and eradicating HPV-infected cells. Several studies have demonstrated that oral immunization with viral antigens can induce antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Oral administration is not only the way to increase mucosal immunity, but it is generally more convenient than parenteral administration. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which are relatively safe and exhibit an adjuvant effect in modulating the immune responses, may be a good delivery vehicle for mucosal immunization [22] [23] [24] . In addition, surface-displayed antigens on lactobacilli were reportedly efficient for inducing antigen presentation in dendritic cells [23] , and surface localization of HPV16 antigens on lactococci was reported to induce greater cellular immunity compared to the intracellular or secreted forms [25] . Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that oral administration of viral antigens displayed on Lactobacillus casei (L. casei), such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus S protein and the HPV16 E7 protein, effectively induces antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies [18] and antitumor responses in mice [19] . In this study, we used the pgsA gene product, a transmembrane protein derived from the polyc-glutamic acid synthetase complex (the Pgs-BCA system) of Bacillus subtilis [26, 27] , as a surface anchoring motif for surface display of antigens on L. casei. Here, we examined whether oral administration of E6 antigens expressed on L. casei could elicit E6-specific cellular immunity. The induction of effective immunity was assessed by production of antigen-specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA, and by quantification of antigen-specific IFN-c-secreting CD8 ? cells in splenocytes or local lymphocytes by the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. Finally, we tested the in vivo tumor regression effect of HPV16 E6-expressing L. casei in a mouse tumor model seeded with the E6-expressing tumor cell line (TC-1).",

            "text": "We generated the expression vector, pKV:PgsA-E6 (Fig. 1a) , encoding PgsA fused to the E6 protein of HPV type 16. The HCE promoter of pHAT:PgsA-E7 [20] was replaced with a promoter of the fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (Pald) gene originating from L. casei, and the E7 proteinencoding gene downstream of the poly-c-glutamic acid synthetase A (PgsA) gene was replaced with that encoding the E6 protein of HPV16. Briefly, the gene encoding the E6 protein of HPV16, was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from the CaSki cell line [28] , using forward (5 0 -CAG GGA TCC ATG CAC CAA AAG AGA ACT GC-3 0 ) and reverse (5 0 -CGC TCT AGA TCA TTA CAG CTG GGT TTC TCT ACG TG -3 0 ) primers that contained BamHI and XbaI sites, respectively. The E7 gene of pHAT:PgsA-E7 was then replaced with the HPV16 E6-encoding fragment using these restriction enzyme sites. The plasmids were first established in E. coli JM83 and then transformed into L. casei BLS by electroporation. E. coli JM83 cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium with erythromycin (150 lg/ml) at 37\u00b0C. Recombinant and expression host L. casei BLS cells were grown in MRS medium with erythromycin (16 lg/ml) at 30\u00b0C. The collected cells were washed with PBS and killed by boiling for 10 min followed by lyophilization.",

The remaining (1:5,000 in 3% skim milk in PBS) was added for detection of antigen-specific antibodies. Following incubation, plates were washed and TMB substrate reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the wells. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature in the dark, the reaction was stopped with 1 M sulfuric acid. Finally, OD 450 was measured using an ELISA reader (Victor 3 , Perkin Elmer, USA).",

After transformation, L. casei cells harboring the pKV:PgsA or the pKV:PgsA-E6 were grown overnight at 30\u00b0C for induction of recombinant protein expression. To confirm proper expression of the HPV16 E6 protein, equal amounts of whole cell lysates from the recombinant L. casei harboring the pKV-PgsA or the pKV-PgsA-E6 were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using both anti-HPV16 E6 and anti-PgsA antibodies (Fig. 1b) . The lane containing the L. casei-PgsA-E6 (Fig. 1b, lane 2) contained a *61 kDa immunoreactive band that most likely represents the fusion protein comprising the 17-kDa E6 protein and the 44-kDa PgsA surface display motif. A smaller band representing expression of the PgsA anchor protein was detected in L. casei-PgsA lysates (Fig. 1b, lane 1) . The surface localization of the HPV16 E6 protein on L. casei was confirmed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy, using a polyclonal anti-HPV16 E6 antibody and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody. FACS analysis revealed a significant increase in fluorescence intensity of the L. casei-PgsA-E6 [mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) = 33.42] compared to that of L. casei-PgsA (MFI = 4.16) (Fig. 1c) . The immunofluorescence microscopy analysis showed that the L. casei-PgsA-E6 was immunostained positive for HPV16 E6, while the control L. casei-PgsA was not (Fig. 1d) .

T cells in mice immunized with the L. casei-PgsA-E6 compared to mice vaccinated with the same dose of the L. casei-PgsA. In the L. casei-PgsA-E6 vaccinated mice, the E6-specific IFN-c-expressing CD8 ? T cell response was increased approximately threefold after the first boost and fivefold after the second boost (p \\ 0.05); such effects were not seen in the L. casei-PgsA-immunized mice. As previously reported, the population of IFN-c-expressing CD8 negative T cells was observed in response to E6 CTL peptide cytometry. b E6-specific IFN-c-secreting splenic T cells stimulated with 1 lg/ml of the E6 peptide were measured by ELISPOT assay. Asterisks represent statistically significant differences relative to the L. casei-PgsA control (*p \\ 0.05; **p \\ 0.01). Data are given as mean \u00b1 SD of triplicate experiments (Fig. 3a) [32, 33] . Next, E6-specific IFN-c-secreting cells were evaluated in splenocytes from the L. casei-PgsA or the L. casei-PgsA-E6-immunized mice, using the ELSPOT assay. Consistent with the above findings, the L. casei-PgsA-E6-treated mice showed a significant CMI response (589.41 \u00b1 114.59 spot-forming cells (SFC)/10 6 cells) after second boost (p \\ 0.01). In contrast, mice orally dosed with the L. casei-PgsA showed a moderate response (103.23 \u00b1 57.32 SFC/10 6 cells) (Fig. 3b) that was similar to that seen in preimmunized mice (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that E6-specific CMI responses were induced in the splenocytes of mice orally immunized with the L. casei-PgsA-E6.",

For mucosal vaccination purposes, lactic acid bacteria are attractive delivery vehicles because they are considered safer than many other live vaccine carriers (e.g. Salmonella, E. coli, Vaccinia) [23] . We chose L. casei because it is a good agent for oral vaccination due to its high intrinsic adjuvant effect and ability to increase innate immunity [36, 37] .

In this study, we investigated the feasibility of targeting the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein for vaccine development to control HPV-associated lesions. We showed that oral treatment of mice with HPV16 E6 proteins displayed on L. casei could induce E6specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA production, and E6specific T cell responses in both the systemic and mucosal immune systems. There was a significant increase of E6specific IFN-c-secreting cells in vaginal lymphocytes from L. casei-PgsA-E6-immunized mice only after the second boost. The mucosal immune system has both inductive and effector sites [35] . This vaccine was orally administered, meaning that its inductive site was mainly in the intestinal regions, which is somewhat distant from the effector site (vaginal region). Therefore, it is possible that the CMI response at this distant effector site could be delayed. However, we found that the number of E6-specific IFN-csecreting cells in the L. casei-PgsA-E6-immunized mice was significantly higher than that in the L. casei-PgsA-immunized mice. More importantly, in an in vivo mouse tumor model, the orally administered L. casei-PgsA-E6 showed antitumor effects against HPV16 E6-expressing murine tumors, as evidenced by reduced tumor size and increased survival rate versus mice receiving control (L. casei-PgsA) immunizations. In accordance with the observation, in vivo depletion of CD4 ? or CD8 ? T cells by MAb GK1.5 or MAb 2.43 completely abrogated anti-TC1 tumor activity in mice orally administration with the L. casei-PgsA-E6. These results showed that both CD4 ? and CD8 ? T cells were essential for antitumor immunity against E6-expressing tumor. The human clinical study using L. casei expressing HPV16 E7 on patients of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3) to check the safety and efficacy is currently in progress. The additional administration of recombinant L. casei expressing HPV16 E6 may enhance its therapeutic efficacy. Collectively, our findings suggest that recombinant L. casei expressing HPV16 E6 antigens may be a promising therapeutic vaccine candidate against cervical cancer.
