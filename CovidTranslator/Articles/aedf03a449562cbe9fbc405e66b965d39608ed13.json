            "text": "The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is known to mediate antimicrobial activity, but its role during rhinovirus (RV) infections and in asthma needs further investigation. Therefore, we addressed the role of IL-17A during allergic asthma and antiviral immune response in human and murine immunocompetent cells. In this study we found that asthmatic children with a RV infection in their upper airways have upregulated mRNA levels of the antiviral cytokine interferon type I (IFN)-b and the transcription factor T-box 21 (TBX21) and reduced levels of IL-17A protein in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We also found that IL-17A inhibited RV1b replication in infected human lung epithelial cells A549. Furthermore, by using gene array analysis we discovered that targeted deletion of Il17a in murine lung CD4 \u00fe T cells impaired Oas1g mRNA downstream of Ifnb, independently from RV infection. Additionally, in PBMCs of children with a RV infection in their nasalpharyngeal fluid OAS1 gene expression was found downregulated. Finally RV1b inhibited IL-17A production in lung CD4 \u00fe Tcells in a setting of experimental asthma. These results indicate that the RV1b inhibits IL-17A in T helper type 17 cells and IL-17A clears RV1b infection in epithelial cells. In both cases IL-17A contributes to fend off RV1b infection by inducing genes downstream of interferon type I pathway.",

            "text": "Asthma bronchiale is a worldwide common chronic disease of the airways that affects 300 million children and adults and its incidence was found to be associated with viral infection in the upper airways, especially in children. [1] [2] [3] [4] Human rhinovirus (RV) is a member of the Picornaviridae family of viruses. RVs of the minor subgroup (e.g., RV1b) adhere to proteins of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. The primary entrance of RV is the upper respiratory tract, where it attaches to its receptors on epithelial cells. 5, 6 The infected cells then release distress signals like chemokines and cytokines. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is a cytokine with proinflammatory functions, whose role in asthma is not completely understood. It is produced by T helper type 17 (Th17) cells and it is also associated with autoimmune diseases. 12 IL-17A was found upregulated in moderate to severe asthma where it contributes, e.g., to accumulation of neutrophils in the airways. 13 Schnyder-Candrian et al. 14 showed that exogenous rmIL-17A during allergen challenge decreased airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). However, IL-17A released by gamma delta cells was also shown to be important for the development of asthma. 15 IL-17A is also involved in mucosal and epithelial host defense against fungi and extracellular bacteria. 16, 17 Furthermore, Th17 cells and IL-17A seem also to modulate immune pathophysiology of viral infections. 18 The 2 0 -5 0 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) pathway functions as an innate host defense in response to viral infections. Its expression is upregulated by type I interferons. Via polymerization of ATP into short 2 0 -5 0 -linked oligomers (2-5A), OAS1 activates latent ribonuclease L (RNaseL), which in turn cleaves viral and cellular singlestranded RNAs. [19] [20] [21] Given that there is an ongoing clinical trial to block IL-17A in asthma, the role of this cytokine in the context of RV infection needs to be clarified. 22, 23 ",

The average age of controls and cases was 4.8 years ( \u00b1 0.2 years). In total, 70.6% of the control children and 60% of the asthmatic children were males and thus 29.4% of the controls and 40% of children with asthma were females. By rating the severity of the disease according to Global initiative for Asthma guidelines (2005) , 60% of the children have intermittent, 25% mild persistent, and 10% moderate persistent asthma. In 65% of the cases a viral infection was a triggering factor for the development of the disease. A combined treatment with steroid and non-steroid drugs was used by 50% of children with asthma. In 45% of the cases the asthma was controlled and partially controlled, respectively (see Supplementary Table  S1 ). Analysis of the lung function of cases and controls showed that 76.5% of controls and only 40% of the cases had a FEV1 above 100%. Both, control and asthmatic children, suffered from several upper respiratory infections (e.g., common cold) during the last 12 months before they were included in the PreDicta (post-infectious immune reprogramming and its association with persistence and chronicity of respiratory allergic diseases) study. By contrast, children with asthma were more susceptible to infections of the lower respiratory tract such as pneumonia (50% compared with 5%) (see Supplementary Table S2 ). This can also be seen in Figure 1a , where the average number of lower respiratory infections during the last 12 months was significantly increased in cases compared with control children. Furthermore, control children as well as children with asthma suffered more often from upper respiratory infections than lower respiratory infections during the last 12 months before the time of recruitment ( Figure 1a ).",

Here, we detected an increased expression of the antiviral cytokine type I interferonb (IFNB) in the PBMCs of children with asthma and a positive RV test in their NPF at the time of recruitment (RV \u00fe ; Figure 1b) . Furthermore, we found that TBX21, the main transcription factor for IFNG 24 and an inhibitor of IL-17A, 25 was upregulated in the PBMCs of these children ( Figure 1c) . Finally, we found a perfect positive correlation between TBX21 and IFNB mRNA production in the PBMCs of these children with a RV infection in their NPF (Figure 1d and e). Consistent with the latter findings, the PBMCs of these children also released significantly less IL-17A compared with those isolated from asthmatic children without RV infection in their nasopharyngeal fluid (Figure 1f) , at the same time point. Furthermore, by correlating the gene expression levels of TBX21 and IL17A in whole-blood samples (Figure 1g-j) , we could observe an inverse correlation between these two factors in control children without a viral infection in the upper airways ( Figure 1g ). In control children, the presence of RV in their NPF abolished this negative correlation (Figure 1h ). By contrast, children with asthma and no RV infection in the upper airways showed only a slight inverse correlation between TBX21 and IL17A (Figure 1i ), whereas the negative correlation was found in children with asthma and an additional viral infection in their NPF ( Figure 1j ).",

            "text": "IL-17A inhibited RV1b replication in infected lung epithelial cells As mentioned above, OAS1 is a key factor in the antiviral immunity and its transcription is induced by type I IFN signaling. Therefore, we also analyzed OAS1 mRNA expression in the PBMCs of the PreDicta children at our department (MP-UK-ER). Here, we observed a significant downregulation of OAS1 gene expression in the PBMCs of children with asthma and an additional RV infection in the upper airways compared with asthmatic children without a viral infection ( Figure 2a) . As both factors, OAS1 and IL-17A, were decreased in asthmatic children with a RV infection in the upper airways, we thought about a direct impact of IL-17A on OAS1 expression. Therefore, we started to analyze the epithelial cell line A549, as airway epithelial cells are the first cell type encountered by infectious agents entering the airways. We then asked about the role of IL-17A on RV1b infection in lung epithelial cells. With this aim we infected the human lung epithelial cell line A549 with RV1b and then cultured them for 24 h with increasing concentrations of rhIL-17A. Here we found a significant upregulation of OAS1 gene expression after treating the A549 cells with 25 ng/ml of rhIL-17A (Figure 2b) . To find out, if we could gain an even better induction of the antiviral immunity with higher concentrations of rhIL-17A, we treated the cells, after infection with RV1b, with up to 100 ng/ml rhIL-17A and concluded that 25 ng/ml of rhIL-17A were sufficient to reduce RV1b mRNA (Figure 2c ). To determine whether IL-17A decreased RV1b expression via OAS1, we first treated A549 cells with OAS1 siRNA or non-targeting (NT) siRNA, infected them with RV1b, and afterwards cultured these cells with increasing concentrations of rhIL-17A. In these experiments, we also analyzed the impact of IL-17A concentrations inferior to 25 ng/ml on OAS1 gene expression. We could only observe a significant increase of OAS1 mRNA expression in A549 cells infected with RV1b and treated with NT siRNA and 25 ng/ml rhIL-17A compared with A549 cells infected with RV1b and treated with NT siRNA and lower amounts of rhIL-17A ( Figure 2d and see Supplementary Figure S2 ). We could also observe that this effect was IL-17A dependent and RV1b independent, as we saw a similar induction after infection with UV-RV1b (see Supplementary Figure S2 ). Next, we measured RV1b mRNA expression in A549 cells infected with RV1b and treated with OAS1 siRNA and 25 ng/ml rIL17A. We found out that IL-17A had also in the absence of OAS1 an impact on viral replication, as we observed a significantly downregulation of RV1b mRNA expression in A549 cells transfected with OAS1 siRNA and 25 ng/ml rhIL-17A, indicating that IL-17A influences viral replication also by affecting other antiviral yet unidentified factors ( Figure 2e ). In conclusion, these experiments show that antiviral properties of IL-17A are linked at least in part to OAS1 in lung epithelial cells.",

Consistent with a role of the Th2-type cytokines in allergic asthma, the Th2 cytokine IL-4 was found to be significantly induced in the airways of OVA-sensitized Il17a ( \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) mice as compared with wild-type littermates (see Supplementary Figure S3c ). Consistent with this increase in IL-4 OVA-treated Il17a ( \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) mice showed a significant decrease of IFN-g in BALF (see Supplementary Figure 3d ). IL-5 and IL-13, two cytokines produced by Th2 cells and by the innate ILC2 cells, 26, 27 were found to be similarly induced in the airways of OVA-sensitized wild-type and Il17a-deficient mice (see Supplementary Figure S 3e and f). Consistent with the levels of IL-5 in the airways, the amount of eosinophils was equivalent in OVA-sensitized Il17a ( \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) and wild-type mice (see Supplementary Figure S4a ). By contrast, Il17a ( \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) OVA-sensitized mice have reduced neutrophils in their airways (see Supplementary Figure S4b ) and a reduced number of mucus producing cells in the airways as compared with their wild-type littermates (see Supplementary Figure S4c ). Both these latter components are known to be involved in the clearance of infectious microorganisms. 28,29 IL-4 is known to induce IgE immunoglobulin class switching in B cells. 30 However, in our model system, the serum levels of IgE in OVA-sensitized Il17a ( \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) mice were comparable to those measured in the wild-type littermates (see Supplementary Figure S4d ). We further investigated Batf mRNA expression, a transcription factor 31 that is expressed in lymphocytes and is also involved in immunoglobulin rearrangements and thus in IgE induction in allergic asthma. 32 Furthermore, it could be shown that BATF is increased in asthma. 32 Consistently in this murine model of allergic asthma Batf mRNA was found to be increased in allergic asthma in an Il17a-independent manner (see Supplementary Figure S4e ). Antiviral Oas1 genes are inhibited in lung CD4 \u00fe T cells obtained from OVA-sensitized Il17a ( \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) mice Aeroallergen sensitization is one of the strongest risk factors for asthma. 33 However, viral infection has also been emerged as a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of this disease. 34 To understand the role of IL-17A in the regulation of different genes that are involved in the response to viral infections, we used a gene array approach in our study. Thus, we sorted out lung CD4 \u00fe T cells from OVA-sensitized wild-type and Il17a ( \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) mice and isolated total RNA and performed gene array analysis. By using this method, we found in Il17a-deficient lung CD4 \u00fe T cells a significant downregulation of antiviral Oas family members such as Oas1a, Oas1c, and Oas1g as well as Cxcr3 and Rnasel (see Supplementary Figure  S5a and b) and an upregulation of proinflammatory genes such as Il6, Il13, Nfil3, and PDC-Trem. By intracellular flow cytometry analysis we also found an upregulation of IL-13 in CD4 \u00fe T cells of na\u00efve Il17a ( \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) mice (see Supplementary Figure S5c ). The downregulation of Oas1a and Oas1g was verified by real-time PCR in lung CD4 \u00fe T cells isolated from na\u00efve and OVA-sensitized wild-type and Il17a ( \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) mice (see Supplementary Figure S5d and e) .",

Furthermore, it could also be demonstrated that RV, in contrast to RSV, is able to directly infect and activate CD4 \u00fe T cells. [35] [36] [37] To address the role of IL-17A during RV infection in asthma, we infected lung CD4 \u00fe T cells obtained from OVA-sensitized wild type and Il17a ( \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) mice with RV1b and cultured them for 24 h (Figure 3a) . By analyzing these cells we could observe that Il17a-deficient lung CD4 \u00fe T cells from na\u00efve mice express significantly more Ldlr than the corresponding wt mice. Furthermore, confrontation with the allergen OVA resulted in a significant upregulation of the expression of this receptor in CD4 \u00fe T cells of wt mice, whereas Il17a-deficient CD4 \u00fe T cells show a downregulation of the Ldlr mRNA expression (Figure 3b) . By using PCR analysis (see Supplementary Figure S6 ) we could confirm the infection with RV1b and after quantification of the PCR bands we found out that lung CD4 \u00fe T cells of na\u00efve Il17a ( \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) mice are more susceptible to viral infection than lung CD4 \u00fe T cells of na\u00efve wt mice (Figure 3c) . Moreover, we could observe a significant upregulation of the viral load in lung CD4 \u00fe T cells obtained from OVA-sensitized wt mice compared with the cells of na\u00efve wt mice, whereas there was no change in the viral load in lung CD4 \u00fe T cells of OVA-sensitized Il17a ( \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) mice, neither to OVA-sensitized wt cells nor to cells of na\u00efve Il17adeficient mice (Figure 3c) . The increase of viral load observed in CD4 \u00fe T cells of OVA-sensitized wt mice could be due to the reduced release of IL-17A by these cells after infection with RV1b ( Figure 3d) .",

Furthermore, by inducing the expression of IFN-b and OAS1, IL-17A also contributes to the suppression of viral replication. Subramaniam and colleagues 3839 observed that IL-17A induced-amongst others-in a time-dependent manner the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2 as well as of STAT1 and STAT2. This might be the underlying signaling mechanism by which IL-17A induces OAS1 gene expression. Furthermore, it is already known that IL-17A activates nuclear factor-kB 40 and this transcription factor is involved in the transcription of IFN-b, 41 which in turn leads to the activation of antiviral factors such as OAS1 via JAK1/TYK2, STAT1/2 and IRF9. But our data also suggest that RV is able to inhibit the release of IL-17A and therefore escaping the immune system ( Figure 4) .To elucidate these molecular mechanisms in more detail, further investigations are needed.",

OAS1 activates RNaseL, which mediates RNA virus degradation. 19, 20 The reduced release of IL-17A by the PBMCs of these children might be due to the induction of TBX21 in the PBMCs of these children, a transcription factor that is known to negatively regulate IL-17A. 25 Furthermore, we found that IL-17A inhibited RV replication in human lung epithelial cell line infected with RV1b. We could also show that IL-17A upregulated OAS1 in this setting. This IL-17A/ OAS1 pathway seems to be independent of IFNB, as we found increased expression of IFNB in children with asthma and an additional RV infection in their upper airways, whereas IL-17A and OAS1 were reduced. This observation is in line with previous findings on increased levels of INFB in PBMCs after infection with RV in vitro. 42, 43 In contrast to these results in PBMCs, in bronchial epithelial cells and in the lung epithelial cell line A549 it has been previously reported that RV inhibits type I interferons. [43] [44] [45] [46] Therefore, it is possible that epithelial cells, which are the first target of the RV, exhibit different immune response as compared with PBMCs. Finally, it is also possible that the usage of different RV strains influences the overall results.",

These observations seem to depend on the time point of IL-17A release. 49 By using the invasive measurement of AHR, we found increased responses to low doses of MCh in OVA-sensitized Il17a-deficient mice as compared with wild-type littermates. At higher doses of MCh OVA-sensitized wild-type mice showed an increased hyperreactivity than the Il17a-deficient mice. The reason of this dual response is at the moment not clear. However, we found increased IL-4 levels and decreased IFN-g in the lung of Il17a-deficient mice which could explain the different responses to MCh. It is possible that IL-4 is acting on the AHR at low doses of MCh and other not yet analyzed factors such as IL-33 and IL-25. [50] [51] [52] [53] In addition, it is already known that IL-17A has an effect on IL-13-induced AHR. 54 Therefore, the induced airway reactivity at low doses seen in the Il17a-deficient mice might be due to the increased combined amounts of IL-13 and IL-4. 26 Additionally, we found less PAS \u00fe cells and airway neutrophils in the absence of Il17a. These two components are known to be involved in the clearance of pathogens. 28, 29 Therefore, this mechanism of host defence is also impaired in the absence of IL-17A.",

Consistent with this finding, lung CD4 \u00fe T cells from OVA-sensitized wild-type mice infected with RV1b have the same viral load as the infected lung CD4 \u00fe T cells from Il17a-deficient mice. These observations could be due to particular expression of Ldlr, which was found upregulated in lung CD4 \u00fe T cells of na\u00efve Il17adeficient mice, whereas confrontation with the allergen promoted the Ldlr mRNA expression in wt cells but inhibited it in Il17a-deficient cells.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that the RV infection targets Th17 cells in the airways of OVA-sensitized mice. Similarly to what we observed in the PBMCs of asthmatic children, RV1b reduces IL-17A production in infected CD4 \u00fe T cells from OVA-sensitized mice. This results in IL-17A deprivation which cannot anymore signal in cells of the innate immune response like epithelial cells. We further demonstrated that IL-17A via OAS1 activation shreds the RV RNA which replicates preferentially in epithelial cells. These findings have important implication for the treatment of RV-induced asthma in children.",

The IFN-induced OAS1-RNaseL antiviral pathway: Type I IFNs bind to the heterodimer of IFNa receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and IFNAR2 which initiates the signal transduction via the tyrosine kinases JAK1 (Janus kinase 1) and TYK2 (Tyrosine kinase 2). In the nucleus, OAS1 (2 0 5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase 1) is transcribed upon induction of IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs). In the cell cytoplasm OAS1 protein accumulates as an inactive monomer. Upon binding of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the enzyme oligomerizes to form a catalytic active tetramer. This active form synthesizes 2 0 5 0 oligoadenylates (2-5A) using ATP as substrate. 2-5A binds to inactive RNaseL and triggers the dimerization of monomers. RNaseL then degrades RNA of viral and also cellular origin. This leads to the inhibition of viral propagation. 20, [61] [62] [63] We assume that IL-17A could induce IFN-b and OAS1 expression and inhibits low-density lipoprotein receptor expression, whereas in turn, rhinovirus could suppress IL-17A.",

To verify that the infection with RV1b was successful a PCR was performed as described previously with some modifications. 57,60 Therefore, cDNA from infected cells and primers, which are complementary to the antisense RNA at positions 542-557 and 169-185 in the 5-noncoding region of RV1b, called OL26 and OL27, was used. A 380-bp amplicon was generated and the samples were analysed and quantified using the QIAxcel Advanced System (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). For detection of RV1b via realtime PCR, RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The resulting template cDNA was amplified by quantitative real-time PCR using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, M\u00fcnchen, Germany) and 200 nM primers.",
