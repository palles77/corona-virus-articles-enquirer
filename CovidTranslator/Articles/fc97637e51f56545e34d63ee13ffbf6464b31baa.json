A newborn with a rectal temperature of 96\u00b0 F has a heart rate somewhere between 200 and 250 beats per minute (bpm). Once the rectal temperature reaches 70\u00b0 F, the heart rate quickly drops to only 40 bpm. A decreased heart rate may result in inappetence, dehydration, and loss of suckling reflexes. In addition, nursing bitches may refuse to nurse and care for cold puppies and even push them away. When body temperature falls below 94\u00b0 F, a gastrointestinal (GI) ileus develops and a chilled puppy will stop trying to nurse. If chilled puppies are not rewarmed before force feeding, regurgitation and subsequent aspiration pneumonia can result (Box 6-2).",

It is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, except for anaerobic bacteria and certain streptococci. Nephrotoxicity has been reported in pups and the young of several species. Animals must have adequate fluid and electrolyte balance if it is to be used. The much-described ototoxicity has not been reported in animals. It is a poor selection in animals with decreased or immature renal function. Enrofloxacin is one of the fluoroquinolones. The antibacterial acts via inhibition of DNA gyrase in bacteria that inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis. Enrofloxacin is a broadspectrum antibiotic and is metabolized to ciprofloxacin. Susceptible bacteria include Staphylococcus, Escherichia coli, Proteus, Klebsiella, and Pasteurella. It does not have good activity against anaerobic bacteria. All fluoroquinolones may cause arthropathy in young animals. It causes abnormal development in articular cartilage and causes destructive lesions in animals younger than 18 months of age. Rapidly growing, large, and giant breeds of dog appear most and as a result the uptake of toxic molecules is increased. Newborn animals also have decreased concentration of plasma proteins the first few weeks of life, which can lead to more unbound compound and a potentially longer plasma half-life and toxic action. Young animals have less total body water and more extracellular fluid than adults, which can lead to a longer half-life of toxic molecules. Furthermore, younger animals have decreased body fat. This results in less accumulation of lipid soluble molecules in the fat and thus persistently increased plasma levels of the drug. Because of increased skin hydration, the newborn animal has greater capacity for percutaneous absorption of molecules. As a result, the pediatric patient is at much higher risk for the significant cutaneous absorption of potentially toxic molecules. Finally, volatile gases are more rapidly absorbed from the pediatric respiratory tract than from adults. As a result, young animals are more sensitive to the potential toxic effects of inhaled gases.",

Bottle-fed pups take longer to feed but consume more than tube-fed pups. The stomach distends gradually during bottle feeding, allowing the newborn to eat more. Since they consume more at each feeding, bottle-fed pups require fewer feedings than tube-fed counterparts. Tube feeding is done using a 5 Fr red rubber catheter for neonates under 300 gm and 8 to 10 Fr for larger neonates. Tube feeding should be done only by experienced personnel. Overdistention is easy to do and can result in regurgitation and respiration pneumonia. Improper tube placement into the trachea is easily done in neonates since no gag reflex develops until approximately 10 days of age. Overfeeding is BOX 6-3 Clinical signs of neonatal septicemia ",
