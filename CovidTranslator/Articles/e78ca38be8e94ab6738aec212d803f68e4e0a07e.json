            "text": "Spongiform neurodegeneration is characterized by the appearance of vacuoles throughout the central nervous system. It has many potential causes, but the underlying cellular mechanisms are not well understood. Mice lacking the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mahogunin Ring Finger-1 (MGRN1) develop age-dependent spongiform encephalopathy. We identified an interaction between a \"PSAP\" motif in MGRN1 and the ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) domain of TSG101, a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport I (ESCRT-I), and demonstrate that MGRN1 multimonoubiquitinates TSG101. We examined the in vivo consequences of loss of MGRN1 on TSG101 expression and function in the mouse brain. The pattern of TSG101 ubiquitination differed in the brains of wild-type mice and Mgrn1 null mutant mice: at 1 month of age, null mutant mice had less ubiquitinated TSG101, while in adults, mutant mice had more ubiquitinated, insoluble TSG101 than wild-type mice. There was an associated increase in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) levels in mutant brains. These results suggest that loss of MGRN1 promotes ubiquitination of TSG101 by other E3s and may prevent its disassociation from endosomal membranes or cause it to form insoluble aggregates. Our data implicate loss of normal TSG101 function in endo-lysosomal trafficking in the pathogenesis of spongiform neurodegeneration in Mgrn1 null mutant mice.",

In humans, spongiform changes are also observed in Alzheimer's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, Niemann-Pick disease (caused by lysosomal storage defects), Leigh disease (caused by mitochondrial dysfunction) and Canavan disease (caused by aspartoacylase deficiency) [5] [6] [7] . Inherited spongiform encephalopathies develop in mutant mice homozygous for null alleles of Mahogunin Ring Finger-1 (Mgrn1), Attractin (Atrn), superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2), Fig4, Vac14 and the Kir4.1 potassium channel subunit [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . These genetic models provide an opportunity to gain insight into the mechanisms that underlie vacuolar changes in the CNS through the identification of the cellular role(s) of the mutated proteins. While the function of the proteins encoded by all of these genes is not known, several are known to affect mitochondrial function or endo-lysosomal trafficking.",

            "text": "The endo-lysosomal pathway plays a critical role in a variety of cellular activities including nutrient intake, signal transduction, and receptor down-regulation, recycling and degradation. Defects in endocytic trafficking are associated with numerous diseases including pigmentation, bleeding and neurodegenerative disorders [9, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Transmembrane proteins are primarily internalized into cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, then delivered into early endosomes (EEs) where they are clustered and sorted into intraluminal vesicles to form multivesicular bodies (MVBs). When MVBs fuse with lysosomes, these vesicles and their contents are degraded by lysosomal enzymes. Sorting into MVBs is a critical regulatory step for many proteins and requires ubiquitination at several steps along the way [25] . Ubiquitination is a multistep process in which the small polypeptide ubiquitin is activated in an ATP-dependent manner and then covalently attached to target proteins through the concerted actions of ubiquitin activating (E1), conjugating (E2) and ligase (E3) proteins [26] . Ubiquitination is a sorting signal for many processes, such as trafficking toward the lysosome from many cellular compartments including the plasma membrane (where it promotes internalization), Golgi (where it can divert proteins to endosomes) and MVBs [reviewed by [27] ].",

The sorting process is initiated by the recruitment of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS, also commonly referred to as ESCRT-0) to the endosomal membrane through its FYVE domain, which binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P). HRS also interacts with ubiquitinated cargos through its ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM), while a C-terminal \"LIEL\" sequence binds to clathrin. HRS recruits ESCRT-I to the sorting site via a PSAP  motif, which binds to the ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) domain of the  ESCRT-I component TSG101. Ubiquitinated cargo are recognized by the  UEV domain of TSG101 and the Npl4 zinc finger (N2F) domain of VPS36  in ESCRT-II. Cargo proteins are clustered by the ESCRT-III complex and  their ubiquitin moieties removed by the deubiquitinating enzyme  DOA4 . Cargo are then sorted to the inner vesicles of MVBs and the ESCRT complexes are disassembled by the AAA-type ATPase VPS4 [28] [29] [30] . Ubiquitination and the ESCRT machinery are also involved in retroviral budding [31, 32] . Ubiquitinated GAG proteins of many viruses, including HIV, associate with TSG101 to recruit it and the ESCRT machinery to the plasma membrane, where the same processes that give rise to MVBs are used to bud virus particles out of the cell [33] [34] [35] [36] .",

This phenotype is preceded by mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated oxidative stress [37] . Mgrn1 null mutant mice also have a defect in pigment-type switching that prevents them from producing yellow pigment [38] , and aberrant patterning of the leftright body axis during development that causes lethal congenital heart defects in \u223c50% of animals [39] . As an E3 ligase, MGRN1 may target a wide variety of proteins for ubiquitination to account for the broad spectrum of phenotypes observed in null mutants, or it may target a small number of proteins that have essential roles in multiple cell types to exert its pleiotropic effects. Here, we confirm a previous report that MGRN1 associates with and ubiquitinates TSG101, a component of ESCRT-I [40] , and extend the analysis by examining the in vivo consequences of loss of MGRN1. We demonstrate that ubiquitination of TSG101 in the mouse brain is regulated in part by MGRN1 and that its solubility and pattern of ubiquitination change with age in normal mice and differs between wild-type and Mgrn1 null mutant mice. We propose a model in which endocytic trafficking in general, and TSG101 in particular, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of spongiform encephalopathy in Mgrn1 null mutant mice.",

P[S/T]AP motifs are considered \"late viral domains\" and the UEV domain of TSG101 has previously been shown to interact with this motif in a variety of proteins including HRS, several viral GAG proteins and the TAL ubiquitin ligase [31, [44] [45] [46] . To test whether the PSAP motif of mouse MGRN1 mediates its association with TSG101, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to convert it to ASAA (MGRN1(ASAA)-GFP). CoIP and immunoblotting assays confirmed that MGRN1 (ASAA)-GFP did not associate with TSG101 (Fig. 2B) .",

In the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, multiubiquitination of TSG101 was increased in MGRN1-GFP transfected cells relative to vector-transfected cells (which contain endogenous MGRN1) and greatly reduced in cells expressing MGRN1(AVVA)-GFP or Mgrn1 siRNA (Fig. 3A, B) . A short exposure of Fig. 3A shows that more multiubiquitinated TSG101 is present in cells expressing MGRN1-GFP than GFP alone, even in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. S2 in the supplementary material). Experiments using GFP-ubiquitin-K0 (in which all lysines have been mutated to alanines, rendering it incapable of forming polyubiquitin chains) in place of wild-type ubiquitin showed a similar pattern of MGRN1-dependent ubiquitination of TSG101, indicating that TSG101 is multimonoubiquitinated by MGRN1 (Fig. 3C) . We confirmed that MGRN1(AVVA)-GFP was still able to associate with TSG101; in fact, TSG101 appeared to associate more strongly with MGRN1(AVVA)-GFP than with wild-type MGRN1-GFP (Fig. 3D) . Catalytically inactive mutants of other E3s have also been shown to bind their target proteins more strongly [i.e., 47].",

Brain proteins from 1-and 6-month-old Mgrn1 null mutant and wild-type mice were extracted in Triton X-100 buffer and the resulting pellet extracted with SDS-containing buffer.

Most TSG101 in the brains of 1-month-old Mgrn1 null mutants was not ubiquitinated and was soluble in Triton X-100. There was a significant increase in soluble and insoluble TSG101 in the brains of 6-month-old Mgrn1 null mutants, with the majority of insoluble TSG101 being ubiquitinated in those samples (Fig. 6) .

HEK293T cells were mock-transfected or transfected with HIV-1 GAG and either a mutant VPS4 that disrupts viral budding (GFP-VPS4(EQ)), empty GFP vector, wild-type MGRN1-GFP or catalytically inactive MGRN1 (MGRN1(AVVA)-GFP). GAG release from cells as VLPs was detected by IB for GAG on proteins extracted from the cell media, while GAG retained in the cells was detected by IB for GAG on cell lysates. The budding index was determined as the ratio of secreted GAG/intracellular GAG in treated samples relative to control (GAG + GFP), averaged over 3 experiments. While the VPS4 (EQ) mutant greatly diminished GAG release, as expected, the addition of excess wild-type or catalytically inactive MGRN1 had no significant effect (Fig. 7A, B) . This suggests that the effect of MGRN1dependent ubiquitination on TSG101 function may be restricted to endo-lysosomal trafficking.",

[40] , showing that the vertebrate-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase MGRN1 binds and multimonoubiquitinates TSG101 to regulate its function in endo-lysosomal trafficking in vivo. We focused on the effect of loss of MGRN1 in the Fig. 5 . EGFR, which requires functional TSG101 for its endosomal transport to the lysosome to be degraded, accumulates in the brains of Mgrn1 null mutant mice. Brain protein lysates from wild-type (wt) and Mgrn1 null mutant animals of the indicated ages were subjected to IB for EGFR. Protein loading is indicated by IB for GAPDH. Fig. 6 . Loss of MGRN1 results in the accumulation of insoluble, high molecular weight (multiubiquitinated) forms of TSG101. Sequential extraction of brain proteins from 1-and 6month-old wild-type (wt) and Mgrn1 null mutant mice was performed to isolate proteins based on their solubility (proteins in Triton X-100 fractions are more soluble than those in SDS fractions). Fractions were subjected to IB to detect unmodified and ubiquitinated TSG101 (TSG101-(Ub) n ). The same blots were imaged for 1 min (top panels) and 10 min (bottom panels), and blotted for GAPDH as a loading control. In the brains of young animals, multiubiquitinated TSG101 was predominantly observed in the SDS fraction. In older animals, multiubiquitinated TSG101 was observed in both fractions, although more was present in the SDS fraction in the brains of Mgrn1 null mutants than in wild-type mice. mouse brain on the regulation of TSG101, where the relationship between Mgrn1 genotype and levels of multiubiquitinated TSG101 (which was lower in homozygous null mutants than in heterozygotes) indicates that MGRN1 is responsible for ubiquitinating a significant portion of TSG101 in the brains of young (1-month-old) wild-type mice. The PSAP motif in MGRN1 that mediates its association with TSG101 is not present in invertebrate MGRN homologs, nor in the vertebrate family member MGRN2 (RNF157). This implies that the ability of MGRN1 to associate with TSG101 is a relatively recent evolutionary event and either has an important vertebrate-specific function or plays a role in vertebrate cells that is performed by another E3 ligase in non-vertebrates. We also observed age-dependent changes in the pattern of TSG101 expression in the brains of wild-type mice, with more TSG101 multiubiquitinated in the brains of young (1-month-old) animals than in adult mice. This suggests that MGRN1-dependent TSG101-mediated endocytic trafficking may be particularly important during development and that only low levels of activity are required for normal adult CNS function.",

The accumulation of multiubiquitinated TSG101 in the brains of older animals that lack MGRN1 suggests that, upon prolonged absence or reduction of MGRN1, TSG101 is recognized and ubiquitinated by another E3. At least two other E3s, MDM2 and TAL (also known as LRSAM1), have been reported to ubiquitinate TSG101 [44, 45, 48, 49] . TAL has been reported to multimonoubiquitinate TSG101 to regulate its cargosorting and viral budding functions [44] , and to polyubiquitinate TSG101 and target it for proteasomal degradation when it is not part of the ESCRT complex [45] . TAL, like MGRN1, is not found in invertebrates. This suggests multiple changes in the regulation of TSG101 during vertebrate evolution.",

Overexpression of MGRN1 had no effect on GAG budding and loss of MGRN1 resulted in elevated levels of EGFR. TAL-mediated ubiquitination of TSG101 increased its solubility [44] . Since the solubility of the ubiquitinated TSG101 that accumulates in the brains of Mgrn1 null mutant mice was reduced, TAL is probably not the E3 that ubiquitinates TSG101 in the brains of older animals lacking MGRN1. The fact that multiubiquitinated TSG101 accumulates in the brains of adult Mgrn1 null mutant mice indicates that it is not targeted for proteasomal degradation, while its reduced solubility suggests that it may form insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates or be membranebound. If the latter, multimonoubiquitination by MGRN1 may be necessary for TSG101 to complete its ESCRT-I function and subsequently be released from endosomal membranes. The increase in EGFR levels in the brains of Mgrn1 null mutant mice is consistent with MGRN1-dependent ubiquitination of TSG101 being required for its normal function in MVB sorting and receptor down-regulation.",

The first is related to the fact that endo-lysosomal trafficking of EGFR is required for its down-regulation and degradation in the lysosome [50] [51] [52] . We observed increased levels of EGFR in the brains of Mgrn1 null mutant mice, particularly in 1-month-old animals. Lysosomal trafficking of EGFR has also been reported to be disrupted in cells in which MGRN1 was depleted by siRNA, with prolonged activation of mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase signaling [40] . Exposure of mixed cortical cultures (containing neurons and astrocytes) to 100 ng/ml of EGF caused neuronal death associated with features of necrosis and increased free radical generation [53] . The EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor C56 blocked the effect of excess EGF, indicating that the neurotoxicity was mediated through EGFR signaling. Thus, accumulation of activated EGFR could be responsible for (or at least contribute to) elevated levels of oxidatively damaged proteins observed in the brains of Mgrn1 null mutant mice [37] and subsequent vacuolation.",

We propose that any mutation that severely disrupts endo-lysosomal trafficking would cause the accumulation of endocytic compartments that could, over time, enlarge to fill the cell. Loss-of-function mutations in Fab1 (endosomal phosphatidylinositol PtdIns(3)P 5-kinase) in Drosophila or Vac14 (a regulator of phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns (3,5)P2) synthesis) or Fig4 (a PtdIns(3,5)P2 5-phosphatase) in mice represents the ratio of GAG signal in VLPs to GAG signal in cell lysates of each transfection relative to that of GAG + GFP control samples. VPS4(EQ) reduced GAG release (p b 0.02) while neither wild-type nor catalytically inactive MGRN1 had a significant effect (p N 0.3).

(B) HEK293T cells were transfected with Myc-tagged TSG101 and control GFP, MGRN2-GFP, wild-type MGRN1-GFP, or mutant MGRN1(ASAA)-GFP (PSAP motif mutated to ASAA). Lysates were subjected to IP using an antibody against Myc (to IP TSG101) and blotted for GFP. Only wild-type MGRN1-GFP coimmunoprecipitated with TSG101, indicating that the PSAP motif is required for their association.

One set of plates was treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 prior to collection of lysates. Lysates were subjected to IP for endogenous TSG101 and blotted for HA (ubiquitin). Regardless of MG132 treatment, TSG101 was multiubiquitinated in cells expressing empty GFP vector or wild-type MGRN1-GFP, with a stronger signal in cells overexpressing MGRN1. Very little ubiquitinated TSG101 was detected in cells expressing catalytically inactive MGRN1 (MGRN1(AVVA)-GFP) or siRNA against Mgrn1. (B) Dose-dependent effect of MGRN1 on TSG101 ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with indicated amounts (\u03bcg) of each plasmid. Lysates were blotted for Myc (TSG101), GFP (GFP or tagged MGRN1) and GAPDH (control for protein loading). A smear of ubiquitinated TSG101 was detected in cells expressing MGRN1, with a stronger signal in cells expressing higher amounts of MGRN1. The intensity of the signal for multiubiquitinated TSG101 (Myc-TSG101-(Ub) n ) was much reduced in cells expressing catalytically inactive MGRN1 (AVVA mutant).
