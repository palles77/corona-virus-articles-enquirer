            "text": "Advances in surgical techniques and immunosuppressive regimens have been pivotal factors in optimizing outcomes after transplantation. The introduction of cyclosporine in the 1980s and tacrolimus a decade later heralded the era of modern immunosuppression, and transplantation advanced from being a quasi-experimental procedure to an established and accepted modality of treatment for a variety of end-organ diseases. Table 313 -1 depicts the most recent data on graft and patient survival released by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). 1 The best results are for living-related kidney transplantation; approximately 99% of the recipients are alive and 96% have a functioning allograft 1 year after transplantation. The greatest progress may have been in liver transplantation, in which the 1-year survival rate before the use of cyclosporine was only 32% compared with the current survival rate of 89%. The survival rates for lung, heart-lung, and intestinal transplant recipients have lagged behind the other groups, but these procedures were only introduced in the 1980s, and experience has been gained slowly because of the limited number of operations performed. Currently, fewer than 150 intestinal transplants are performed annually in the United States; however, 1-year patient survival rates at highvolume experienced centers currently approach 90%. Improvements in graft and patient survival have been paralleled by a decline in mortality from infections ( Fig. 313-1 ). The most recent data from the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network show that infection-related mortality within the past decade has continued to decline in all types of organ transplants (see Fig. 313-1) . Nevertheless, infections still account for 13% to 16% of the deaths in kidney and heart transplant recipients and up to 21% in lung transplant recipients (Table  313 -2). In liver transplant recipients, approximately 50% of the mortality within the first post-transplant year was infection associated. 2 Although calcineurin inhibitors have been the mainstay of immunosuppression for more than 3 decades, long-term outcomes remain suboptimal, largely due to renal dysfunction and metabolic complications from cumulative exposure to these agents. For example, chronic renal dysfunction develops in 7% to 21% of the organ transplant recipients and increases the risk of death by approximately fourfold. 3 These concerns have spawned a growing interest in new regimens that enhance immunologic tolerance (e.g., interleukin-2 [IL-2] receptor inhibitors [basiliximab] and T cell-depleting antibodies [alemtuzumab or thymoglobulin]). T cell-depleting agents increase the risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Use of these agents as antirejection but not induction therapy also confers a higher risk of fungal infections.",

However, a larger, multivariate analysis of more than 28,000 kidney recipients in the Medicare database showed that urinary tract infection after 6 months was associated with worse long-term graft function and survival. 7 Abnormalities such as ureteral reflux, strictures at the ureterovesical junction, or neurogenic bladder should be sought in patients with recurrent infections.

The clinician should also be alert to the occurrence of uncommon urinary pathogens. For example, urinary tract tuberculosis may arise from a focus in the native kidney. Mycoplasma hominis may cause a breakdown of the ureterovesical anastomosis with subsequent graft loss. Histoplasmosis may involve the transplanted kidney and cause renal failure.

The types of infections seen in lung transplant recipients are similar to those in heart-lung recipients, although the overall survival rate is better. Heart-lung transplantation is now usually reserved for patients who have Eisenmenger's syndrome and whose cardiac abnormalities cannot be surgically repaired. Singleand double-lung procedures leave the donor heart available for another patient with end-stage heart disease. A unique aspect of single-lung transplantation is the occurrence of infections in the native lung that may be predisposed to infection because of defects of ventilation or perfusion caused by the underlying lung disease. Lung and heart-lung transplant recipients experience a high rate of bacterial lung infections, especially during the first few weeks after transplantation. These patients also have higher rates of mediastinitis, invasive fungal infections, and CMV pneumonia than heart recipients. Some patients undergoing lung transplantation are chronically colonized with multidrug-resistant bacteria (e.g., cystic fibrosis, non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis) and are therefore at high risk for postoperative infection at the time of transplant surgery. Antimicrobial treatment directed against pretransplant colonizing bacteria is typically given for several weeks after transplant.

            "text": "Left-ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are now widely used as a bridge to transplantation. Infections of these devices are common and fall into distinct types: driveline infections, which are often limited to the exit site; deep infections in the pocket surrounding the device; and internal infection of the device, which is often associated with bloodstream infection. Management of these infections is challenging; however, in many cases, the infection can be controlled well enough to permit transplantation. Available experience suggests that the use of antimicrobial therapy before, during, and after transplantation is associated with fewer relapses than short-course therapy. Although pretransplant LVAD infection is associated with a higher rate of peri-heart transplant complications, long-term outcomes appear to be reasonable and LVAD infection is not considered a contraindication to heart transplant. 10 A number of other infections occur more commonly in heart recipients than in patients receiving other types of transplants. These include toxoplasmosis, nocardiosis, and Chagas' disease. Toxoplasmaseronegative heart recipients are at risk for toxoplasmosis because the infection can be acquired from organisms encysted in the heart muscle of toxoplasma-seropositive donors. Clinical toxoplasmosis usually occurs a few weeks to a few months after transplantation and is manifested by necrotizing pneumonitis, myocarditis, and encephalitis. Before the use of preventive therapy, the rates of toxoplasmosis were 60% to 80% in donor toxoplasma seropositive/recipient seronegative patients and approximately 5% to 10% in toxoplasma seropositive recipients. Clinical toxoplasmosis is now uncommon in heart recipients, likely because of the use of TMP-SMX for Pneumocystis prophylaxis. 9 Symptomatic reactivation of Trypanosoma cruzi may be seen in immunocompromised patients, including transplant recipients. About one fourth of patients who undergo heart transplantation for cardiomyopathy caused by chronic T. cruzi infection have relapses of acute Chagas' disease, with clinical manifestations of fever, myocarditis, and skin lesions. The disease can usually be controlled with chemotherapy. Detection of parasitemia by microscopy or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in blood samples is useful to monitor for reactivation and guide chemotherapy after transplantation.",

Ongoing HCV infection leads to graft cirrhosis in up to 30% of patients by 5 years after transplantation. Findings from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) liver transplantation database have shown that long-term outcomes (>5 years) after liver transplantation for HCV are similar to those after liver transplantation for other indications. 23 However, a retrospective analysis of more than 10,000 liver recipients in the UNOS database showed that medium-term survival of HCV-infected patients was inferior to that of uninfected patients. Longitudinal studies in kidney transplant populations have also shown that chronic HCV infection has an adverse impact on survival, but this effect is not clearly discernible until the second decade after transplantation.

In liver transplant recipients, these include the degree of immunosuppression, the use of antirejection therapy, high viral loads before or early after transplantation, older donor age, CMV infection, and, in some studies, infection with HCV type 1b. Although the choice of a calcineurin inhibitor and use of mycophenolate mofetil have not been conclusively shown to have an effect on HCV recurrence rates, higher cumulative exposure to corticosteroids is associated with increased mortality and more severe histologic recurrence of HCV. Antiviral treatment of recurrent HCV infection after liver transplantation is under active investigation. Interferon monotherapy produces end-of-treatment responses in only 12% to 36% of liver recipients with HCV infection, but very few patients have sustained responses 6 months later. 24 The use of combination therapy with long-acting pegylated interferons and ribavirin has led to sustained virologic response rates of 26% to 50%. 24 Based on these data, pegylated interferon with or without ribavirin has been the treatment of choice for histopathologically documented hepatitis C recurrence, but there are differences of opinion on optimal timing and selection of patients for treatment. In actual practice, interferon and ribavirin have side effects that make them difficult to administer to liver transplant recipients, so only a small proportion of the patients are actually able to benefit from their use. Currently, treatment is generally used only in patients with histologically significant disease (grade 3 or 4 inflammation, grade 2 to 4 fibrosis) rather than preemptively in all infected patients. With the development of several new classes of both direct-acting antivirals (protease inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors) and host-targeted agents (cyclophilin inhibitors) that inhibit HCV replication, the indications for initiating therapy are likely to broaden and the efficacy of newer regimens is anticipated to be substantially improved compared with current pegylated interferon/ribavirin regimens. influenza, parainfluenza, RSV, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, or adenovirus may cause pneumonia in transplant recipients.

In the current era, the outcome for patients at risk for recurrent HBV infection after liver transplantation has been greatly improved by the availability of agents able to prevent or treat recurrence and the development of quantitative molecular assays to measure the hepatitis B viral load in the blood. The most effective approach to prevent recurrent HBV is the use of post-transplant combination therapy with antiviral agents and HBIG in addition to pretransplant antiviral therapy. Monotherapy with lamivudine is not recommended because of the reappearance of HBsAg after liver transplantation in 32% to 50% of the patients. Newer antiviral agents including adefovir dipivoxil, tenofovir, and entecavir have also been available for lamivudine-resistant HBV. Regardless of the agents used, HBV viral loads should be monitored after transplantation to detect breakthrough infection before clinical consequences develop. Antiviral therapy for HBV should be modified on persistent elevation of the viral load (>3 log copies/mL). 21 Transplant candidates who have chronic HBV and those who are in the inactive HBsAg carrier state should initiate antiviral therapy for HBV that should be continued after transplantation.

Primary infections occurring in seronegative recipients with a seropositive donor are more likely to be symptomatic. The proportion of infected patients who become symptomatic is also a function of the intensity of immunosuppression. The absolute viral load and change in viral load are the most important determinants of symptomatic infection (i.e., CMV disease) (see Chapter 140). 28 The most common type of CMV disease is a mononucleosis syndrome characterized by fever with few or no focal symptoms. Abnormalities may be found on liver function tests, although jaundice rarely occurs. Tissue-invasive disease may manifest as pneumonitis, gastrointestinal disease, or hepatitis. In this era when prolonged antiviral prophylaxis is routinely used, CMV disease in organ transplant recipients is often a late manifestation, and approximately 30% of these cases have tissue-invasive disease. 29 Interstitial pneu monia is the most serious complication of CMV infection and is present in most fatal cases. Fever, dyspnea, hypoxemia, and diffuse infiltrates on chest radiographs are typical findings, but bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or lung biopsy is required for diagnosis. CMV pneumonia may coexist with other pathogens in the lung, particularly Pneumocystis.",

However, oral valganciclovir is a reasonable alternative in carefully selected nonseverely ill patients, thereby simplifying therapy. 30 In patients with CMV disease and viremia, therapy is typically continued until resolution of CMV viremia because the risk of relapse is lower in patients who do not have detectable CMV DNA after ganciclovir therapy. 31 Although ganciclovir is proved to be effective, its administration requires parenteral access. A large, randomized, multicenter trial (the VICTOR study) demonstrated that oral valganciclovir is safe and has long-term outcomes noninferior to those of intravenous ganciclovir for the treatment of CMV disease in non-severely ill organ transplant patients. 30 Foscarnet and cidofovir are also active against CMV but are used infrequently in solid-organ recipients because of their side effects, and they are generally used only in patients with ganciclovir-resistant CMV. Ganciclovir-resistant CMV has emerged as an important complication of transplant and has been associated with donor seropositive/ recipient seronegative status, potent immunosuppression, and prolonged and incompletely suppressive antiviral drug exposure. The diagnosis is suspected in transplant recipients without a clinical or virologic response, or both, to full-dose ganciclovir therapy and can be confirmed with genotypic resistance testing directly from clinical specimens (e.g., blood and BAL). Mutations in specific regions of UL97 confer resistance to ganciclovir, whereas mutations in the UL54 region can confer resistance to ganciclovir, cidofovir, or foscarnet, either alone or in various combinations. An algorithm for the management of suspected ganciclovir-resistant CMV in transplant recipients has been published. 32 The greatest advance in regard to CMV infection in transplantation in recent years has been the development of accurate and reproducible quantitative methods, including an international laboratory standard, Routine use of antiviral prophylaxis or preemptive therapy for HHV-6, however, is not currently recommended.",

Figure 313 -2 depicts the cumulative incidence of herpes zoster in a cohort of transplant recipients from 1996-2007 by organ type. 27 Induction therapy with T-cell antibodies has been a predictor for the development of herpes zoster. Antiviral therapy is indicated because healing is often slow and transplant recipients occasionally develop neurologic complications or disseminated infection. Oral therapy with acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir suffices for dermatomal zoster. If the patient has ophthalmic zoster or there is evidence of dissemination, intravenous acyclovir is used initially. Primary VZV infection (chickenpox) in a transplant patient also usually requires admission to the hospital and treatment with intravenous acyclovir, although some pediatric heart transplant recipients on low doses of immunosuppression have been successfully treated for with oral valacyclovir. Obtaining serology results for VZV before transplantation identifies patients at risk for primary infection so that they can be vaccinated and counseled to avoid (and report) exposures. Varicella-seronegative transplant recipients who are exposed may benefit from the use of varicella-zoster immune globulin when given up to 10 days after exposure. However, it should be administered as soon as possible. PCR; however, it is limited by low specificity for nephropathy. The specificity of PCR diagnosis can be enhanced by quantitation of BK virus in blood, with higher viral loads having greater specificity for nephropathy. 35 Although noninvasive assays play an important role, biopsy remains useful for definitive diagnosis, staging of disease (with implications for prognosis), and for identifying concomitant processes (rejection, etc.). 34 Natural history studies in kidney transplant recipients have shown a predictable pattern of progression of BK virus infection: initial detection of BK virus in urine, then in blood, then progression to BK virus nephropathy, typically over the course of months. With the advent of quantitative PCR assays, the primary approach is to prevent progression to BK virus nephropathy by using preemptive reduction in immunosuppression guided by viral load assays, typically from blood. Once histologically evident disease has developed, reduction in immunosuppression may improve or stabilize renal function, but nearly one third to one half of the patients still progress to kidney failure. Antiviral agents such as cidofovir and leflunomide, fluoroquinolones, or IVIG have been reported to be useful therapies in anecdotal reports, but definitive evidence that these agents are effective is lacking. 34 Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) occurs in patients with impairment of T-cell immunity and is caused by JC virus. Unlike the situation in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, in which PML occurs in 4% to 5% of patients with low CD4 counts, PML is rare after transplantation. Patients develop profound neurologic deficits that can include various motor, sensory, visual, or cognitive findings occurring over a subacute course of weeks to months. A brain biopsy is required for a definitive diagnosis, but the diagnosis is strongly suggested by the finding of characteristic white matter changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and JC virus DNA by PCR in the CSF. There are no proven therapies for PML, but some reports have documented stabilization or improvement with reduction or withdrawal of immunosuppression (where feasible), but the overall prognosis is dismal, with mortality in the vast majority of patients within 6 to 12 months of diagnosis.",

Acceleration of HIV infection or increased rates of opportunistic infections have not been reported as major problems in HIV-positive transplant recipients. Recently, renal transplantation between HIV-positive donors and recipients has been reported in some high incidence areas such as South Africa. 40a Additionally, the legal barrier to the use of HIV-positive donors has been removed in the United States. 40b",

            "text": "Primary EBV infection occurs in about three fourths of seronegative pediatric or adult transplant recipients. Reactivation infection, defined by viremia by PCR, is detected in up to one third of seropositive transplant recipients. Most infections occur within the first 4 months after transplantation. The most important disease associated with EBV infection in transplant recipients is post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Most patients with PTLD (80% to 90%) have evidence of EBV infection by serologic rises or by measurement of EBV viral load in saliva or peripheral blood. The risk for PTLD is 10-to 76-fold higher in transplant recipients who are EBV seronegative before transplantation than in patients who are seropositive. 37 The other major risk factor for PTLD is the use of high doses of immunosuppression, especially polyclonal or monoclonal antibody formulations directed against T cells. 37 The detection of high viral loads of EBV in the blood by PCR has been associated with a high risk for PTLD in some studies, but the predictive power of this finding needs to be validated in larger, prospective studies. 37 PTLD is variable in its presentation. It may resemble infectious mononucleosis without evidence of tissue involvement except in tonsils and peripheral lymph nodes. Another manifestation is a diffuse polymorphous B-cell infiltration in visceral organs. This type may be preceded by a mononucleosis-like episode that either evolves directly into the tissue infiltrative process or is temporally separated from it. The third clinical presentation is the appearance of localized extranodal lymphomas in the gastrointestinal tract, thorax, or other parts of the body, including the brain. These are mostly B-cell lymphomas and usually contain EBV genome detectable by nucleic acid hybridization or EBV-specific antigens detectable by immunohistochemistry. The tumors may be either monoclonal or oligoclonal, as determined by immunoglobulin G (IgG) light-chain phenotype or immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies, and are typically of host rather than donor origin. Antiviral agents such as acyclovir and ganciclovir inhibit the lytic phase of EBV infection and virion production, but not the replication of cells latently infected with EBV. 37 There is no definite evidence that the use of antiviral medications provides any benefit in treating or preventing PTLD, but theoretical considerations and data from some retrospective studies suggest that post-transplantation antiviral prophylaxis may decrease the overall incidence of PTLD. 37 Reduction or elimination of immunosuppression may lead to regression of PTLD in about one half of cases. Regression is more likely with tumors that appear during the first year after transplantation and with those that are polymorphous in appearance or contain tumor cells that are polyclonal by laboratory studies. Treatment of PTLD by infusion of monoclonal antibodies directed against surface antigens of B cells is a theoretically attractive approach and has achieved initial remissions in about two thirds of patients with PTLD. 37 Tumors with more malignant phenotypes require chemotherapy. The infusion of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-compatible, EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) has been found to be an effective treatment in cases of PTLD those with unrecognized cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, may transmit this yeast with the allograft. Active histoplasmosis or undiagnosed and presumably asymptomatic infection in the donor that had not resolved by the time of death can result in donor-derived histoplasmosis. Potential donors from an endemic area with either active or occult infection can also transmit coccidioidomycosis. In general, donors with undiagnosed meningoencephalitis are not suitable for donation because transmission of not only fungal pathogens but other diseases, including prion infections and Balamuthia, may occur (Table  313-7) . Rare instances of aspergillosis and other filamentous fungi, including agents of mucormycosis, have also been transmitted from infected donors. More recently, these fungi have emerged as a serious complication of transplant tourism (the practice of traveling abroad to commercially acquire an organ) and have been associated with graft loss or death in 76% of the cases. 43 Heart transplant donors and recipients should be serotested for toxoplasmosis. Given the paucity of cysts in noncardiac tissue, screening of non-heart donors for toxoplasmosis is not routinely performed. Donor screening for Chagas' disease should be performed in those who have lived or traveled in an endemic area.",
