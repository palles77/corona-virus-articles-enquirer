In response, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (with support from PricewaterhouseCoopers) coordinated subject matter experts to create a preparedness plan for Disease X. Disease X is caused by Pathogen X, an infectious agent that is not currently known to cause human disease, but an aetiologic agent of a future outbreak with epidemic or pandemic potential. We have identified crucial areas for acceleration in medical countermeasure product development and international coordination. We have also reviewed novel platforms and process improvements related to manufacturing, which could revolutionise the response to the next pandemic. Finally, we created several coordination and engagement guides. These guides range from the rational design of an intervention target product profile, to the key facets of vaccine and therapeutic development, to accelerated manufacturing and regulatory mechanisms. In this Personal View, we provide a high-level summary of the outcomes of the medical countermeasure development workstream, intended for a broad audience including academia, medical countermeasure developers, and multilateral coordinating bodies. We hope that they might find this piece useful in prioritising strategic investments and efforts to accelerate medical countermeasure development. We observed that in-depth analyses of clinical trial design, chemistry, manufacturing and control activities, and accelerated regulatory pathways are necessary for shortening the timelines for the product development of medical countermeasures. We intend to cover these topics in future publications.",

In 2016, WHO's Research and Development Blueprint was launched to decrease the time for development, assessment, and authorisation of medical countermeasures for the world's most dangerous pathogens. Although this effort has provided unprecedented coordination, past epidemics have revealed many scientific and technical issues that remain unresolved. The rapid development of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics in the wake of an epidemic involves a complex and interdependent stakeholder ecosystem: these stakeholders might have different priorities, interests, and activities resulting in misaligned goals and delays. Additionally, uncertainty remains as to who will pay the costs, offset the risk, and accelerate research, clinical trials, and product development for medical countermeasures. The global community has an opportunity to align and coordinate these efforts across stakeholder groups.",

The goal of the convening was to focus the few resources in pandemic preparedness on the crucial and persistent barriers that remain across research, clinical trials, and manufacturing before and during an epidemic. We attempt to define Pathogen X and present the challenges, opportunities, and priorities in the acceleration of diagnostic, vaccine, and small molecule development in preparation for an epidemic. Also, we present coordination guides that have been shown to be successful in planning and prioritising development activities. We hope that this content will enable funders, academia, and product developers (ie, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies) to better navigate the epidemic medical countermeasure space. The content should also support stakeholders in coordinating and engaging with developers of medical countermeasures, regulators, and government officials.

            "text": "The epidemiology of Pathogen X Pathogen X could be any pathogen including but not limited to viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, or prions. Of the 400 emerging infectious disease events recorded since 1940, bacteria (including rickettsia) account for 54%, whereas viral or prion pathogens (25%), protozoa (11%), fungi (6%), and helminths (3%) are less common. 2 This zoonotic transmission often occurs where human activities take place in a landscape of wildlife, insect, and microbial diversity. 7 Their emergence is largely driven by anthropogenic changes; as humans alter their patterns of land use for agriculture, trade, livestock rearing, and travel, these pathogens have an opportunity to cross species and establish localised emergence. A synergy of enhanced virulence and population dynamics act to drive transmission from these selflimiting emergence events into sustained persontoperson transmission. Thus, pandemic emergence is assumed to be likely to occur because of the following risk factors: human activities near wildlife, creation of animal source foods with little monitoring of employees and a poorly understood supply chain, insect and tick vectors, extreme population density, and constrained surveillance and laboratory capacity. [8] [9] [10] Consequently, we can hypothesise that the advent of a catastrophic outbreak involving Disease X is likely to result from the zoonotic transmission of a highly virulent RNA virus 11 from an area where a convergence of risk factors and population dynamics will result in sustained persontoperson transmission. This premise does not negate the need for measures against other types of pathogens of pandemic importance, but the work on Disease X that we have done is modelled on the development of medical countermeasures against this particular pathogen archetype. However, the development of medical countermeasures does not demand that the epidemiology of Disease X is known, and many con served elements of product development remain that do not vary on the basis of established pathophysiology or epidemiology. In the first instance, development of medical countermeasures for Disease X will inevitably include plans to detect cases and mobilise the movement of samples and data to developers.",

Challenges to the availability of such samples include logistical difficulties in storing and transporting biohazardous samples from remote areas, obtaining sufficient informed consent from patients, and political complications from countries that refuse to transit or accept hazardous specimens. 12 To overcome these operational and political obstacles, an opportunity exists to establish regional biorepositories and formalise multilateral agreements concerning the collection and transport of specimens. The Nagoya Protocol 13 -a treaty designed to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources-could not only be expanded to include other biological material, but also enhanced to include exceptions or fast track options for emergency research on pathogens. 14 Issues of intellectual property and benefit sharing continue to hamper the development of medical counter measures during epidemics. Stakeholders need to negotiate intellectual property contracts and agree ments to facilitate the sharing of pathogen sequences, 15 clinical samples, and diagnostic platforms before outbreaks occur. 16 For example, the Pandemic Influenza Pre paredness Framework 17 was negotiated over 4 years and resulted in a cooperative approach to benefit sharing, as well as substantial cost sharing of the laboratorybased surveillance system. Since its institution, there has been more open sharing of influenza samples. Although the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework is limited by its inability to address sharing of pathogen genetic sequence data, it represents a model on which sample and sequence sharing can be based.",

Here, we list technological and process opportunities for shortening the development times of diagnostics, vaccines, clinical trials, and small molecules for Disease X (table 1). Technological opportunities speed up discovery and translation of new products. Process opportunities facilitate early alignment and more effective collaborations.

Such licensing could probably increase the regulators' confidence that the platform can be successfully applied to prevent disease from a new pathogen. Such platforms include plugandplay recombinant vectors 3 and nucleic acid vaccines, 21 which require swapping gene cassettes for an antigen of choice (table 1) . These platforms promise to accelerate progression into clinical development by using existing (even if partial) toxicity data, bridging studies, and optimised manufacturing plans. Establishing the efficacy of each candidate within the platforms remains the most serious challenge, which can currently only be addressed through empirical testing. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation is funding development of several RNAbased and DNAbased platforms to address this need. [26] [27] [28] Another strategic opportunity to accelerate develop ment of effective therapeutics across modalities is through development of broad and narrow spectrum therapeutics against priority pathogen families (table 1) . Broad spectrum drugs (eg, immune modulating com pounds) are inherently more useful, but subject to considerable technical risk as they advance in develop ment. Narrow spectrum drugs are more achievable in the near term.",

Together, they should align on appropriate nonclinical models and study designs, and deploy assistance in coordinating latestage trials. This approach can clarify clinical trial endpoints that would be supportive for accelerated regulatory approval. Alternatively, several accelerated pathways exist that derive human efficacy data from animal surrogates or inter mediate clinical endpoints, and provide considerable scientific and agency support.

We believe that these highimpact, pathogenagnostic, and lowrisk opportunities enable the best nearterm preparedness for Disease X. We also advocate for the use of iTPPs that outline the full characteristics required for developing de novo medical counter measures. We described an array of variables that could be considered up front: early consideration might avoid unintended delays and unproductive avenues.
