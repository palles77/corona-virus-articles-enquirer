Different clinical types indicate that patients have different pathophysiological processes or are at different stages of disease development, and therefore require tailored treatment aproaches. Although the efficacy of antiviral therapy is still uncertain, combination treatment based on the inhibition of viral replication might reduce the inflammatory injury, and can allow the body to gradually produce enough virus-specific antibodies to clear the virus through the immune response, and ultimately cure the disease. There is a great debate on the use of corticosteroids for coronavirus infection such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [11, 12] and Middle East respiratory ryndrome (MERS) [13, 14] , and the data of systemic corticosteroid treatment in critical COVID-19 are lacking. The findings of this study support the use of corticosteroids in severe COVID-19. Early use (immediately on admission or within the first three days of hospitalization) might relatively rapid control the disease progress or avoid disease further deterioration. Short-term and low-dose administration (methylprednisolone 0.5mg~1mg/kg.d\u00d75 days) could avoid the corticosteroid's potential risks; on the other hand, such cortocosteroid use does not influence the SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody production.",

For severe COVID-19 patients, treatment approach is comprised of oxygen support including mask oxygen(\uff1e5L/min), high flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO), or non-invasive ventilation (NIV); triple antiviral treatment including an oral antiviral regimen, ribavirin and recombinant interferon-\u03b12b (usage and dosage same as above). The recommended duration of antiviral treatment is 10 days. For severe patients, corticosteroid (methylprednisolone 0.5mg~1mg/kg.d\u00d75 days) should be given immediately on admission or within the first three days of hospitalization.

Results This study includes 55 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 including 12 patients in mild group and 22 in moderate group (non-severe group, n=34), and 21 patients were in severe group (table1). The median age was 59(29-77) years in nonsevere group and 62(29-91) years in severe group (p=0.37). There are 47.1%(n=16) male patients in non-severe group and 38.1% (n=8) in severe group (p=0.58). The most at onset of illness were fever (26[76.5%] in non-severe group and 19[90.5%] in severe group) and cough (13[38.2%] in non-severe group and 11[52.4%] in severe group). The median Days from onset of symptoms to hospital presentation were 11(3-40) in non-severe group and 10(1-30) in severe group (p=0.89). Patients in severe group had a faster respiratory rate and heart rate (p=0.015, 0.012), and a lower SpO2 than patients in non-severe group (p=0.045). There are significant higher levels of fibrinogen, D-dimer, and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) in in severe group (p\uff1c0.001,\uff1c0.001,\uff1c0.001), and there are also significant higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, creatine kinase, and hypersensitive troponin I in severe group than those in non-severe group (p=0.004,\uff1c0.001, 0.01, 0.007),",

Nodular or peripheral ground-glass opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing were found in 16(47.1%) paients in non-severe group (overall lesions\uff1c30%) and 8(38.1%) patients in severe group (overall lesions\u226530%). Bilateral multiple lobular or subsegmental areas of consolidation were found in 12 patients (35.3%) in non-severe group (overall lesions\uff1c 30%) and 11 patients (52.4%) in severe group (overall lesions\u226530%).At the end of the first two weeks after admission (as of Mar 1st), clinical manifestations had completely despeared in 31(91.2%)patients in non-severe group, and 18(85.7%) patients in severe group (p=0.85). Chest CT was re-examined with an interval of 5-14 days. It was found that patients in both groups had a satisfied radiologic imaging recovery, which includes 22(64.7%) patients in non-severe group and 12(57.1%) patients J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f in severe group recovered at least 50% of the whole leisions in the first week, and 28(82.4%) patients in non-severe group and 16(76.2%) patients in severe group recovered at least 75% of the whole leisions in the second week. There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients who had SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance between the non-severe group (33[97.1%]) and the severe group (20[95.2%]) (p=0.92). There were also no significant differences in the levels of SARS-CoV-2-IgM(35.1[0.92-292.8]AU/ml vs 62.8[0.3-621.0]AU/ml) and IgG antibody production(162.8[0.86-195.1]AU/ml vs 145.7[1.8-204.1]AU/ml) between the two groups (p=0.13, 0.62).
