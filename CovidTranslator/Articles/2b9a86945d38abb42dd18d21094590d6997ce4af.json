With regard to the adequacy of a patent application's written description of how to make and use the invention, contemporary case law in the U.S. highlights two significant tests. The more classic of the two is what is often referred to as \"enablement\"-this is the more technologically-based test of whether one of ordinary skill in the art could make and use the claimed invention without \"undue experimentation\". The other major test of adequate disclosure in the U.S. is often referred to as the \"written description\" requirement. This test is focused on factors such as whether the inventors have shown, through their patent specification (in sufficient wording and detail), that they are truly \"in possession\" of the invention as claimed.

In the Wands case, the patent claims at issue related to immunoassay methods for the detection of hepatitis B surface antigens using high-affinity IgM monoclonal antibodies, and the issue was whether undue experimentation would have been required to produce the monoclonal antibodies. The patent applicant asserted that his invention was enabled because the monoclonal antibodies needed to perform the immunoassays could \"easily be made from readily available starting materials using methods that are well known in the monoclonal antibody art\" (8) . The court agreed and noted that there was no challenge to applicant's contention that the starting materials (mice, HBsAg antigen and myeloma cells) were available to the public. Most importantly for future cases, the court set forth the following eight factors to consider in determining whether \"undue experimentation\" would be needed:",

In order of expanding scope, the claims at issue in Wright were directed to vaccines against the specific Prague Avian Sarcoma Virus (PrASV) in chickens; vaccines against all avian RNA viruses; and vaccines against all RNA viruses. However, the patent application gave only \"a single working example\" of a vaccine (specifically, a vaccine against PrASV in chickens). The court held that the narrower claims directed to vaccines against the specific chicken virus were allowable, but the court also held that the claims drawn to vaccines against any and all avian RNA viruses, as well as the claims directed to any and all RNA viruses, were not enabled. The court cited examples such as the general difficulty in developing RNA virus vaccines (such as AIDS vaccines) and reasoned that one working example was simply insufficient given the lack of predictability due to the mutation and diversity of these RNA viruses. Moreover, the court noted there was nothing in the record to establish that an immune response caused by an antigenic envelope protein would have been sufficient to rise to the level of an \"immunoprotective\" response (9) .",

In that case, the University presented claims covering the entire genus of \"vertebrate\" cDNAs encoding insulin (in addition to claims drawn to \"mammalian insulin cDNA\" and narrower claims drawn specifically to \"human insulin DNA\"). However, the University's patent application disclosed only rat cDNA, along with the amino acid sequence for human insulin, and a method for isolating human DNA using the rat sequence. In ruling that the University's claims failed to meet the written description requirement and were therefore unpatentable, the court stated that a \"description of rat insulin cDNA is not a description of the broad classes of vertebrate or mammalian insulin cDNA,\"(10) Citing Fiers v. Revel, 984 F.2d 1164, 1171 (Fed. Cir. 1993), the court reiterated its belief that claims to a cDNA require \"a kind of specificity usually achieved by means of the recitation of the sequence of nucleotides that make up the DNA\" (11).",

In this case, Amgen had claims broadly directed to \"vertebrate\" host cells and \"mammalian\" host cells, but Amgen's examples were limited to monkey cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Nevertheless, the court held that since host cells are very different from cDNA (in terms of readily conveying distinguishing information concerning identity), Amgen's disclosure satisfied the written description test because one skilled in the art could easily recognize the identity of the members of the claimed genus (13) . Furthermore, when it came to the enablement requirement, the court relied primarily on expert testimony in ruling that Amgen's broad claims to \"vertebrate\" and \"mammalian\" host cells were sufficiently enabled by disclosure of just the two species of mammalian cells (14) .",

Here, the court applied the standard set in Lilly and ruled that patent applicant's specific, narrow disclosure of mouse antigen was not sufficient to support a patent claim for a more generic scope of coverage for CD40CR antibodies (especially when it comes to other species). The court held that antibody claims must be fully characterized for there to be proper written description, noting that \"as long as applicant has disclosed a fully characterized antigen, either by its structure, formula, chemical name, or physical properties, or by deposit of the antibody in a public depository, the applicant can then claim an antibody by its binding affinity to that described antigen\" (15) .",

In general, the evaluation of \"inventive step\" in Europe starts with the identification of the \"closest prior art\" and the \"technical problem to be solved\". This is then followed by an analysis of whether the technical solution to the problem represents an unexpected or \"non-obvious\" advance over the \"closest prior art\" (when combined with either a second prior art reference or common general knowledge in the relevant art). A thorough review of the European case law on inventive step can be found in Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, pp. 120-168 (5th Ed. 2006) (20) . With particular regard to the life sciences, it is worth noting cases such as Modifying Plant Cells/MYCOGEN (T 694/92; OJ EPO 1997, 408), Vaccines/GENENTECH (T 187/93; 1997), and Triazole/ AGREVO (T 939/92 OJ EPO 1996/309), where there is an interesting interplay between the \"inventive step\" requirement of Article 56 EPC and the \"sufficiency of disclosure\" requirement of Article 83 EPC. In particular, these cases show that it has been the practice of the European Patent Office, under the so-called \"problem and solution\" approach, to evaluate whether or not the problem in a given case has been solved across the full scope of the claims, and then to limit a patent proprietor's claims to a scope commensurate with the proprietor's actual contribution to the art.",

Section 271 (e)(1) provides a \"safe harbor\" exemption from patent infringement for \"uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a Federal law which regulates...drugs or veterinary biological products,\" and this special exemption has been given a fairly broad interpretation under recent case law.(22) However, once a party commercializes a therapeutic, that party can no longer use the Section 271(e)(1) exemption as a defense. It also would not be a defense simply to say that it is the clinician or veterinarian who is the infringer and not the company that supplies the therapeutic product. This is because the company selling the product commercially could be accused of inducing infringement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(b) or contributing to infringement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(c). Although it is beyond the scope of this article to speculate on how all this might be played out in court and what remedies might or might not be available, there are some court cases that may be of interest in this analysis. See, e.g., Hybritech Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, 849 F. 2d. 1446 (Fed. Cir. 1988), where the defendant's infringing cancer and hepatitis test kits were not included in the preliminary injunction order against the defendant since the patentee did not offer such kits and there were no other suppliers at the time. Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court has recently issued a landmark decision on remedies in patent infringement cases, ruling there is no longer a \"general rule\" in patent cases that courts will almost always issue permanent injunctions against infringement. Specifically, in eBay, Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C, 547 U.S. __, 126 S. Ct. 1837 (2006), the Supreme Court held that in patent cases, like all other types of cases, permanent injunctions can only be issued where the remedy is appropriate in light of equitable principles. This means that the remedy must be assessed under the wellestablished four-factor test used in all other cases, whereby a plaintiff/patentee seeking a permanent injunction is required to show that:",

The component of the application that establishes human food safety must contain an analytical method that has been properly validated. The performance characteristics of that method are then integrated into the establishment of a withdrawal time (i.e., the time between the last dose and when the animal-derived food product is considered to be safe for human consumption). Interestingly, although the analytical method would be considered as part of the product dossier, the analytical method becomes an integral component of the drug monitoring program and must be the method used by any laboratory involved in the monitoring of food for \"violative residues\".

            "text": "A question sometimes arises as to whether a \"second patent term restoration\" is possible for an animal health approval when the same active ingredient has already been extended for a human therapeutic product. In general, the patent term restoration statute contains strong prohibitions against obtaining a second patent term restoration for the same active ingredient (26). However, if one reads carefully through all the statutory prohibitions, the possibility for the following special scenario can be seen: Assume that a company has two patents: Patent A covering the use of Compound X in a human indication (as approved under Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\")) and Patent B covering use of the same Compound X in an animal indication (as approved under Section 512 of the FDCA). Then, in this particular situation (assuming all the other conditions are met), the company can obtain one extension-on Patent A-based on the human indication, plus an additional extension-on Patent B-based on the veterinary indication. Key to this scenario, of course, is the assumption that Patent A does not extend in scope to cover the veterinary use and Patent B does not extend in scope to cover the human use.",

The Orphan Drug Act does not extend to animal drugs. However, animal drugs meeting certain criteria have the possibility to obtain a so-called Minor Use/Minor Species (MUMS) designation for qualified \"minor species\" (e.g., goats, sheep, fish, etc.) or for uncommon \"minor uses\" in the major animal groups (cattle, cats, dogs, swine, poultry, etc.).
