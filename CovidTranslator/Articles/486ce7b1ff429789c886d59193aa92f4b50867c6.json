This was followed by sequencing of PCR amplicons and phylogenetic analysis. We report the detection of a novel gammaherpesvirus most closely related to a type 2 ruminant rhadinovirus from mule deer.

The first verified record of muntjac deer in the wild in Northern Ireland was confirmed during June 2009 as a result of a road traffic accident near Newtownards, Co. Down [4] . This is the first known introduction of a new large mammal species in Northern Ireland since the introduction of sika deer (Cervus nippon Temminck, 1838) in 1870. The second record was a culled animal (referred to hereafter as 'animal 1') shot in the grounds of Mount Stewart, Co. Down, in June 2011. In February 2013, another animal was shot in the same locality (referred to hereafter as 'animal 2'). Furthermore, in the spring of 2013 and 2014, a camera trapping survey confirmed the presence of a small muntjac population within this area [5] . In April 2013, eleven positive detections of muntjac were made at seven separate locations in this area using camera traps.",

There is a significant risk of them introducing novel pathogens to native wildlife that are immunologically naive. In addition, invasive species pose a similar threat to domesticated food animals and a zoonotic threat to human populations. Deer are known to be susceptible to bovine, caprine and ovine viruses and vice versa. A recent study from Japan showed native wild and American farmed sika deer to have antibodies against bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine adenovirus type 7, bovine coronavirus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), and bovine herpesvirus type 1 [10] . Antibodies to the recently emerged Schmallenberg virus, which causes foetal abnormalities, have been reported in red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and muntjac deer in Austria, Belgium and England [11] . BVDV has been detected in a wide range of wild and captive deer in Europe and North America, including roe deer, red deer, fallow deer (Dama dama), elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) [12] . In the Republic of Ireland, an industry-led compulsory national BVDV eradication programme commenced in 2013 (http://www.bvdfree.ie), while the compulsory phase of the Northern Ireland eradication programme began in 2016 (http://www.animalhealthni. com/BVD.aspx). In order for muntjac deer to be considered a reservoir for re-introduction of BVDV to cattle after eradication efforts, the animals must be susceptible to infection and able to shed the virus, the virus must be capable of being maintained in the population, and there must be sufficient contact with domestic livestock [13] . It is not known if muntjac deer fulfil these criteria for BVDV or other pathogens, but an expanding muntjac population should be monitored closely to assess the level of risk posed.",

In the animals examined, the virus was present at very low levels and was only detected after two rounds of PCR in healthy animals.

The evolutionary history was inferred using the UPGMA method. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the maximum composite likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. The test of phylogeny was by the bootstrap method with 500 replications. Analyses were conducted using MEGA6 So while the risks associated with viruses in invasive muntjac deer in Ireland are not fully understood, if the muntjac population becomes established, it could potentially interact with livestock in terms of the evolution, spread and maintenance of viral infections. Camera trap and anecdotal evidence strongly suggest that muntjac are becoming established in Ireland and it is known that muntjac can form successful populations from a limited number of founding females [18] . As such, there is significant value in monitoring the virological status of these invasive animals. As our phylogenetic tree is based only on a small fragment of a single gene, further sequencing would be necessary to provide a definitive classification of this gammaherpesvirus, and metagenomic analysis of additional samples using next-generation sequencing would be a powerful method of further virus discovery.",
