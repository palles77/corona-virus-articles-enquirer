The scheme of the experimental set-up with predicted outcome is depicted on the right. The reactions were separated on polyacrylamide gels and subjected to autoradiography. Radioactive PARP10 signal was quantified and normalized to the pre-modified PARP10 treated with MacroD2 signal (reaction ii). Error bars represent s.e.m. (n=2). (b-f) PARP10 demodification reaction by MacroD2 was tested for dependence on (b) ADPr product inhibition, line represents a theoretical fit for inhibition; (c) temperature; (d) MacroD2 enzyme concentration; (e) pH; (f) incubation time, lines represent a theoretical fit for single turnover kinetics. Demodification reactions with [ 32 P]-ADP-ribosylated PARP10 were carried out by varying the studied parameter, followed by separation on polyacrylamide gels and quantifying the residual [ 32 P]-PARP10 signal on autoradiographs. Where appropriate, the signal was normalized to MacroD2 activity at 37 \u00b0C. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (n=2-3). (g) ARH1 has no detectable activity towards ADP-ribosylated PARP10. The assay was carried out as in Supplementary Figure 9 Jankevicius et al.",

The ADPr-Glu ester was parameterized using the Antechamber module of Amber11 and the ester ligand was docked into the ligand binding site by superposition of the ADPr part on the crystal structure of ADPr in complex with MacroD2. The resulting structure was energy minimized and served as a start structure for MD simulations. The complex was solvated in an octahedral box using the TIP3P water model 2 and neutralized by adding sodium and chloride ions. The system was heated to 300 K employing positional restraints on the solute atoms followed by a stepwise relaxation of the positional restraints. After a 5 ns equilibration simulation without restraints the conformational dynamics and water binding was investigated during 10 ns production at 300 K and a constant pressure of 1 bar.",
