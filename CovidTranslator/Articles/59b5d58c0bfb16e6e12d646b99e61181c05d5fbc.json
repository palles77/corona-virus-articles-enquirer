Targeted recombination was used to introduce amino acid substitutions into the cleavage signal of the fusion glycoprotein (spike or S protein) of MHV strain A59. The recombinants were then used to address the question of the importance of S protein cleavage and viralmediated cell-to-cell fusion on pathogenicity. Our data indicate that cleavage of spike is not solely determined by the amino acid sequence at the cleavage site, but may also depend on sequences removed from the cleavage site. In addition, ef cient cell-to-cell fusion is not necessary for virulence. Journal of NeuroVirology (2002) 8, 400-410.",

These proteases have also been shown to cleave a variety of viral fusion glycoprotein s (Bolt and Pedersen, 1998; Bolt et al, 2000; Hallenberger et al, 1997; Vey et al, 1995; Volchkov et al, 2000) .

These mutants, however, encode two amino acid substitutions in the S protein. One mutation lies within a putative receptor binding region of S (Kubo et al, 1994) , and the second, at amino acid codon 716 (H716D), is within the cleavage signal of S (Luytjes et al, 1987) . Previous data suggested that the H716D substitution prevents cleavage of the S protein, which would account for the delayed fusion phenotype of these mutants, because several cleavage and fusion revertant viruses replaced the aspartic acid residue (Gombold et al, 1993) . The mutant cleavage and fusion phenotypes were seen only when the H716D substitution was present (Hingley et al, 1995; Leparc-Goffart et al, 1997 ; however, none of the glial cell mutants had the H716D mutation alone, so it was necessary to isolate recombinant viruses expressing the H716D mutation alone in order to assess the potential affect of this particular mutation on cleavage of S, fusogenicity, and virulence.",

These recombinants, described in previous studies (Das Sarma et al, 2000; Leparc-Goffar t et al, 1998; Phillips et al, 1999) , would control for possible effects of mutations outside of the S gene, because all recombinants have the same background genes and therefore differ only by the de ned mutation near the cleavage site.

Previous studies from this laboratory using mutants isolated from persistently infected glial cells (Gombold et al, 1993) have suggested that an H716D mutation, which changes the RRAHR cleavage signal to an RRADR sequence, is associated with an uncleaved S protein, but did not directly assess the affect of that mutation on virulence. As one would predict, and as seen in Figure 1 , the H716D mutation did dramatically reduce the amount of S protein cleavage compared to cleavage of the wild-type protein (S H716D R24 and S H716D R26 versus S A59 R10). However, upon examining multiple blots of S H716D R24 and S H716D R26 lysate and virion samples, it was also evident that, although cleavage was inhibited, it rarely appeared to be completely prevented.",

In contrast, S protein expressed by Penn-98-1, a recombinant virus with the entire MHV-2 S gene placed into the MHV-A59 background, appeared uncleaved in Western blots ( Figure 1 ).

For example Tsai et al (1999) hypervariable region of S1 that converts a cleaved, fusogenic S protein into an S protein that is still cleaved, but nonfusogenic. There are additional examples of mutations either in the hypervariable region of S1 (Phillips et al, 2001) , or in the heptad repeat region of S2 (Gallagher et al, 1991; Luo and Weiss, 1998) , that disrupt S-mediated cell-to-cel l fusion independently of cleavage. The data reported here are consistent with the observation that cleavage of S correlates with more ef cient induction of cell-to-cel l fusion. However, our data differ from these other studies in that they are the rst observation of viruses with the same cleavage signal sequence (Penn-98-1 versus S cs2 recombinants), yet different levels of cleavage and fusion. Thus, the cleavage signal alone does not determine cleavage of S. Krueger et al (2001) suggest that S-mediated cell-tocell fusion correlates with a dissociation of the S1 and S2 subunits of the MHV spike protein. Consequently, a more stable interaction between S1 and S2 would be associated with a delayed fusion phenotype. Inhibition of S protein cleavage would be associated with a more stable interaction between S1 and S2 and correlate with a loss of fusogenicity. This could account for the delayed fusion phenotype observed with the S H716D and S cs2 recombinants.",

A fragment containing the H716D mutation was generated by ampli cation of two shorter fragments. The 5 0 end fragment was generated using primers FS413 and RSH716D, and the 3 0 end using primers WZL47 and RS830 (Table 4) . Primers RSH716D and WZL47 introduced a histidine to aspartic acid nucleotide substitution in amino acid codon 716. The 928-bp and 387-bp PCR fragments were gel puri ed and used as templates for a third PCR reaction with primers FS413 and RS830. The resulting 1315-bp fragment was gel puri ed, digested with restriction enzymes DraIII and XhoI, and then cloned into the corresponding sites in pFV1. This clone was designed pFV1-H716D. The entire DraIII/XhoI fragment of pFV1-H716D was sequenced to verify the presence of the H716D mutation, as well as the absence of other mutations.",

After the virus was allowed to attach to the cells for 1 h, additional media was added and the infection continued for 9 to 16 h. Virions present in culture supernates were obtained by ultracentrifugatio n at 126,000 \u00a3 g for 2 h. Viral lysates were prepared by lysing infected cells with 200 \u00b9l lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40). Viral pellets and lysates were electrophoresed into 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)polyacrylamide gels in a Tris Acetate buffer system (Novex) and transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane. MHV S protein was detected using a polyclonal goat anti-S antibody (AO4; provided by K Holmes, University of Colorado HSC, Denver, CO) and a chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham). Image analysis of Western blots was performed using Gel-Pro Analyzer software from Media Cybernetics. Protein bands migrating at a molecular weight of 180 and 90 kDa were selected, and the analysis program generated an optical density measurement for these bands after ltering out background. The relative amount of material migrating at 90 kDa, corresponding to cleaved S, compared to protein migrating at 180 kDa, or uncleaved S, was calculated using the following formula: OD 90 kDa /(OD 90 kDa C OD 180 kDa ), and expressing the results as a percentage. This number is de ned as the percent cleaved S. A limitation of this type of quanti cation is that it does not take into account oligomeric, alternatively processed, or immature forms of S. Thus, the numbers obtained in this manner must be considered to be a semiquantitative measure of S cleavage.",
