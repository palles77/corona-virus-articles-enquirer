Spike S is assembled as a trimer and contains around 1,300 amino acids within 56 each unit 7 . In the S' region of the protein, the receptor binding domain (RBD), which contains 57 around 300 amino acids, mediates the binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme, (ACE2) 58 attacking respiratory cells. Another region upstream of the RBD, present in MERS-CoV but not in 59 of specific elements in the spike S region, which provide clues on the evolution of domains 69 involved in the binding to ACE2 and sialic acid. 70 71 As highly structured regions of RNA molecules have strong propensity to form stable contacts with 72 proteins 16 and promote assembly of complexes 17,18 , SARS-CoV-2 domains containing large 73 amount of double-stranded content are expected to establish specific interactions in host cells. To 74 investigate the interactions with human proteins, we employed catRAPID 12, 13 . catRAPID 14 75 estimates the binding potential or protein and RNA molecules through van der Waals, hydrogen 76 bonding and secondary structure propensities of allowing identification of interaction partners with 77 high confidence 15 . Our analysis revealed that the 5' of SARS-CoV-2 has strong propensity to 78 attract human proteins, especially those associated with viral infection, among which we found a 79 group linked to HIV infection. Intriguingly, a previous study reported similarities of viral proteins 80 in SARS-CoV and HIV-1 19 . In HIV and SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV nor MERS-CoV, a 81 furin-cleavage site occurs in the spike S protein 20 . This unique feature could explain the spread 82 velocity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 83",

In addition to the maximum corresponding to nucleotides 23000-24000, the structural content 102 of spike S protein shows minima at around nucleotides 20500 and 24500 (Fig. 1) . 103 We used the Vienna method 23 to further investigate the RNA secondary structure of specific 104 regions identified with CROSS 11 . Employing a 100 nucleotide window centered around CROSS 105 maxima and minima, we found good match between CROSS scores and Vienna free energies (Fig.  106   1) . Strong agreement is also observed between CROSS and Vienna positional entropy, indicating 107 that regions with the highest structural content have also the lowest structural diversity. 108 109 Our analysis suggests presence of structural elements in SARS-CoV-2 that have evolved to interact 110 with specific human proteins 9 . Our observation is based on the assumption that structured regions 111 have an intrinsic propensity to recruit proteins 16 , which is supported by the fact that structured 112 transcripts act as scaffolds for protein assembly 17, 18 . In this analysis, we compared the Wuhan strain MN908947 with around 2800 other coronaviruses 122 (data from NCBI) having as host human (Fig. 2) or other species (Sup. Fig. 1) . When comparing 123 SARS-CoV-2 with human coronaviruses (1387 strains, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), we 124 found that the most conserved region falls inside the spike S genomic locus (Fig. 2) Using Clustal W for multiple sequence alignments 24 , we observed general conservation of the 145 coding regions with several minima in correspondence to areas between genes (Fig. 3A) . One 146 highly conserved region is between nucleotides 23000 and 24000 in the spike S genomic locus, 147 while sequences up-and down-stream are variable (Fig. 3A) .

            "text": "In order to obtain insights on how the virus is replicated in human cells, we analysed protein-RNA 174 interactions with SARS-CoV-2 against the whole RNA-binding human proteome. Following a 175 protocol to study structural conservation in viruses 11 , we divided the Wuhan sequence in 30 176 fragments of 1000 nucleotides moving from the 5' to 3' and calculated the protein-RNA 177 interactions of each fragment with the human proteome using catRAPID omics (105000 178 interactions, consisting of around 3500 protein candidates for each of the 30 fragments) 12 . For each 179 fragment, we identified the most significant interactions by filtering according to the Z interaction 180 propensity. We used three different thresholds in ascending order of stringency: Z greater or equal 181 than 1.50, 1.75 and 2 respectively. Importantly, we removed from the list proteins that were 182 predicted to interact promiscuously with different fragments. Table 1 ). Considering the three thresholds applied 193 (Materials and Methods), we found 22 viral proteins for fragment 1, 2 proteins for fragment 2 and 194 proteins and were included because they could have potential RNA-binding ability (Fig. 5) 33 . As 204 for fragment 2, we found two viral proteins: TRIM32 (Q13049) and TRIM21 (P19474), which are 205 listed as negative regulators of viral release from host cell, negative regulators of viral transcription 206 and positive regulators of viral entry into host cells. Finally, for fragment 29, 10 of the 11 viral 207 proteins found are members of the endogenous retrovirus group K Gag polyprotein family, that 208 perform different tasks during virus assembly, budding, maturation (Sup. Table 1) . 209 210 Analysis of functional annotations carried out with GeneMania 34 reveals that proteins interacting 211 with the 5' of SARS-CoV-2 RNA are associated with regulatory pathways involving NOTCH2, 212 MYC and MAX that have been previously connected to viral infection processes (Fig. 5) 35, 36 . 213",

As the 239 nucleic acids encoding for this region are enriched in double-stranded content, we speculate that the 240 structure might attract host regulatory proteins, which further constrains its variability. The fact that 241 the ACE2 receptor binding site is conserved among the SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests that a 242 specific drug can be designed to prevent host interaction and thus infection, which could work for a 243 large number of coronaviruses.

CROSS was developed to perform high-throughput RNA profiling. The algorithm predicts the 285 structural profile (single-and double-stranded state) at single-nucleotide resolution using sequence 286 information only and without sequence length restrictions (scores > 0 indicate double stranded regions). We 287 used the Vienna method 23 to further investigate the RNA secondary structure of minima and 288 maxima identified with CROSS 11 . CROSSalign 11,43 an algorithm based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), to check and 293 evaluate the structural conservation between different viral genomes 11 .

The significance is assessed as in the original publication 11 sequences of the complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from Virus 303 Pathogen Resource (VIPR; www.viprbrc.org), for a total of 62 strains.

Analysis of functional 327 annotations was performed in parallel with GeneMania 34 . were performed using Clustal W 24 on 62 SARS-CoV-2 strains and related Spike 333 S proteins. The variability in the spike S region was measured by computing Shannon entropy on 334 translated RNA sequences. The Shannon entropy is computed as followsa correspond to the amino acid at the position i and P(a,i) is the frequency of a certain 339 amino-acid a at position i of the sequence. Low entropy indicates poorly variability: if P(a,x) = 1 for 340 one a and 0 for the rest, then S(x) =0. By contrast, if the frequencies of all amino acids are equally 341 distributed, the entropy reaches its maximum possible value. , N. et al.
