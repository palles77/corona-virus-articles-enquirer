            "text": "It is not known exactly how the autonomic nervous system responds to and is affected by the initiation and progression of neuroimmunological disease. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by immune effector cell insult on the myelin sheath of the central nervous system. MS can be associated with a monophasic, relapsing or chronic disease course. There have been numerous reports of autonomic and cardiovascular dysfunction associated with the disease [11] [12] [13] [14] . In some cases, autonomic dysfunction has been correlated with disease status and fatigue in people with MS [15] [16] [17] . Other studies have noted a correlation in MS patients between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and midbrain or brainstem lesions observed by magnetic resonance imaging [18] [19] [20] . Spectral analyses of HRV in individuals with MS have indicated disturbances in both parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways [21] [22] [23] . Researchers attempting to study the involvement of autonomic disturbance in MS The autonomic nervous system regulates internal homeostasis. This regulatory process is functionally mediated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the nervous system, which generally work in opposition to each other. Sympathetic functions typically enable 'fight or flight' responses, whereas the parasympathetic division is more involved in 'rest and digest' functions of target organs. Fluctuations in heart rate (HR), for example, are influenced by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways, and spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) can distinguish components contributed by each pathway 1,2 . In humans, decreased HRV is currently used as a predictor of increased morbidity and mortality with various forms of cardiovascular [3] [4] [5] and non-cardiovascular diseases 6, 7 . Direct innervation of immune system components has been demonstrated for the sympathetic pathway but not for the parasympathetic pathway 8 ; however, there is much evidence to suggest that the parasympathetic nervous system down-modulates the immune response 9,10 . A telemetric study of physiologic changes in mice with induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis Telemetric monitoring Telemetry transmitter devices (model PA-C10, Data Sciences International, St. Paul, MN) were implanted into mice that were anesthetized with isoflurane. Per supplier recommendations, we inserted the tip of the device's catheter into the left carotid artery of the mouse. We then placed the transmitter body subcutaneously (s.c.) in an abdominal pocket, sutured incisions and administered buprenorphine to the mouse as an analgesic.",

In mouse 2, HR peaked close to disease onset but then quickly returned to normal levels. This indicates that the pre-disease diurnal pattern can re-emerge after recovery from acute EAE; the rate at which this occurs may be connected to the peak severity of clinical disease. A return to pre-disease physiologic patterns after recovery may be normal in the SJL mouse, as EAE follows a remitting-relapsing disease course in this strain. Because this was a pilot study, we observed mice for only 17 d. It is not known whether normal HR and BP patterns would be disrupted to the same extent with each relapse, or whether these patterns would be fully restored at each remission. Nor is it known whether or to what extent these physiological parameters might research note high and low spectral frequencies in mice with induced EAE; these findings may indicate the disruption of both sympathetic and parasympathetic influences 29, 32 . Analysis by time domain also indicates that a disruption of autonomic control may occur in EAE mice.
