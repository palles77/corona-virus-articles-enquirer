NEC in full-term infants is well documented, accounting for about 10% of babies with NEC; it usually involves babies with known risk factors, such as intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, gastroschisis, polycythemia, hypoglycemia, sepsis, exchange transfusion, umbilical lines, milk allergy, premature rupture of membranes with and without chorioamnionitis and gestational diabetes.

Serial abdominal X-rays were taken until complete resolution of clinical and radiological findings. Feeding was resumed 7 days after normalization of abdominal X-rays. Each infant received intravenous cefotaxim and amikacin for a total of 7 days until cultures came back negative. Table 1 shows that over the last 10 years, the incidence of NEC among full-term infants at our institution has increased, from 0. 16 per 1000 live births (full-term infants only) in 1993 to 0.71 per 1000 live births in 2002. This increase has been conspicuous mainly over the last 2 years, as shown in the table. The incidence of CS increased from 19% in 1998 to 24% in 2002 (in comparison to 14 to 16% in the previous 5 years). During the 5 years of the study, 14 full-term infants were found to have NEC. In this same period, the rate of NEC among VLBW infants born at our hospital decreased from 5.1% in 1998 to 2% in 2002. Maternal diseases observed in this group of infants included gestational diabetes, hypothyroidism and Turner's syndrome. All but one of the infants with NEC were born by CS, six due to nonreassuring fetal heart rate monitoring without apparent birth asphyxia (with one exception). The other seven infants were born by elective CS due to breech presentation, twin pregnancy or previous CS. As shown in Table 2 , seven infants had known predisposing risk factors for NEC, such as growth retardation, polycythemia, congenital hypothyroidism, birth asphyxia, congenital heart malformation, and one infant with an as yet undiagnosed syndrome. The other seven infants either exhibited no obvious predisposing risk factors or had some common mild conditions, such as hyperbilirubinemia, early asymptomatic hypoglycemia and transient tachypnea. None of these infants was entirely breast-fed. The age of NEC onset in most of these babies was only a few days, except for two infants (N 2&4), with congenital heart disease and undiagnosed syndrome, respectively.",

Another seven infants were born by elective CS. The possible relationship between increasing rates of CS and early NEC in full-term infants may be explained by the fact that sicker infants are saved by CS and by improved neonatal resuscitation. However, the low rate of birth asphyxia in the study group as well as the high rate of elective CS do not support such a hypothesis. So far, CS on its own has not been considered a risk factor for NEC by most authors, although Uauy et al. 15 did mention CS as a significant risk factor in their group of VLBW infants with NEC. Recently, Minkoff and Chervenak 16 discussed a possible mechanism by means of which the anesthesia involved in elective CS causes a possible transient drop of blood pressure, perhaps thus compromising placental blood supply and fetal circulation. In addition, the maternal supine position prior to and during the operation may further reduce fetal circulation and thus interfere with intestinal blood supply. The increasing incidence of CS in our institution may play some role in the higher incidence of NEC observed in this study. About 90% of all elective CS in our institution are under epidural anesthesia capable of compromising splanchnic blood supply to the fetus. This hypothesis should be further investigated by means of fetal Doppler blood flow measurements.",

In that study, only three patients were healthy prior to development of NEC. 5 Other studies have also confirmed the hypothesis that the occurrence of NEC in a full-term infant is usually associated with a predisposing event. Out of 29 full-term infants with NEC, Bolissety found only two that had no prior illness known to be associated with the development of NEC. 3 Beeby reported eight full-term infants with NEC, all with a predisposing event. 18 Similarly, Wiswell found an unremarkable course prior to the development of NEC in only three of 43 full-term infants with NEC. 12 Our study shows only a 50% rate of infants with known risk factors for NEC. The other seven infants had no known risk factors for NEC, but still exhibited some minor medical conditions, such as asymptomatic hypoglycemia, mild tachypnea, hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy, and delivery by CS with or without mild abnormal fetal heart monitoring and with no apparent birth asphyxia.",

            "text": "Several studies identified a connection between congenital heart disease and NEC in term infants. The frequency of this connection ranged from 7.6% to 38% of term infants with NEC: Polin F 5 out of 13, 4 Thilo F 6 out of 79, 6 Andrews F 2 out of 10 7 and Bolissety F 10 out of 29. 3 To the best of our knowledge, only two cases of hypothyroidism and NEC have been described so far. The first was the case of a 10day-old full-term infant with a history of hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy. Positive clinical signs included persistent open posterior fontanelle. No thyroid tissue was identified by ultrasound. The infant was treated with intravenous thyroxin. 19 The second patient developed NEC at the age of 6 weeks, 10 days after Nissen funduplication for severe gastro-esophageal reflux. Prior history included hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy with seizures within the first 24 hours, treated with anticonvulsants. Thyroxin was commenced at age 17 days. Investigation confirmed thyroid dysmorphogenesis. Both infants were diagnosed by the newborn screening test, 3 as was the case presented in our study. A pathogenic relationship between hypothyroidism and NEC has been suggested. Thyroid hormone deficiency causes decreased gut motility due to peripheral neuropathy of the intestine. In the presence of feeding, this may allow for intestinal bacterial overgrowth, increased gas production and abdominal distension. A second factor relating the hypothyroid state with NEC is the hemodynamic effect of thyroid hormone deficiency. In the fetal and perinatal periods, the thyroid hormone is required for normal increase in cardiac output in response to catecholamines. An unsatisfactory increase in cardiac output in response to stress may lead to decreased mesenteric blood flow and bowel ischemia. 19 NEC in term infants has also been associated with the repair of gastroschisis 8 and myelomeningocele and lipomyelomeningocele. 10 The pathogenesis is unknown, but several factors appear to play either a primary or a secondary role, including infectious agents and toxins, enteral alimentation, exposure to anesthetic agents and mesenteric ischemia with tissue hypoxia.",

About 90% of NEC infants in the study group were receiving all of their meals by mouth prior to the development of NEC. It is hypothesized that (1) incompletely digested formula can provide a substrate for bacterial proliferation and (2) feeding increases intestinal oxygen demand during nutrient absorption, thus increasing the risk of intestinal tissue hypoxia that can cause mucosal injury and bacterial invasion. Most neonatologists increase feeding volumes gradually in preterm infants, although this is usually not the case for full-term infants. Human milk appears to be beneficial in preventing NEC, most probably by enhancing growth of lactobacilli and by immunologic mechanisms. 1, 11 The infants in the study group were distinguished by a lack of sufficient breast milk.",

Cardiovascular stresses such as hypotension, hypothermia, hypoxia, feeding, anemia and umbilical vessel catheterization are all associated with the development of NEC. The immature intestines may have reduced ability to regulate blood flow and oxygenation. 1 Bacterial colonization of the intestinal tract is a prerequisite for initiation of NEC. The occurrence of NEC in epidemics suggests that an infectious agent may play a role in the pathogenesis of NEC. Numerous bacteria and viruses have been isolated in epidemics, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, Klebsiela pneumonia, Clostridium perfringes, butyricum and difficile, Enteroviruses, Coxsackie B virus, Corona virus and Rotavirus. Nonetheless, most of these isolated organisms are part of the normal intestinal flora. Supplementation with Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus acidophilus reduced the incidence of NEC, probably by preventing the overgrowth of more pathogenic enterobacteria. 1, 10, 11 This etiology could not explain the high incidence of NEC in the study infants described here.",

The concentration of Interleukin 1 and 6 (IL-1, IL-6) and Tumor-Necrosis-Factor-alpha (alpha-TNF) is elevated locally. Nitric-oxide (NO) production by enterocytes is increased and results in enterocyte apoptosis through peroxy-nitrite formation. Conversely, NO deficiency may also predispose the intestine to NEC. 10 Moreover, deficiencies in both magnesium and copper can damage the gut's antioxidative defense and produce a pro-NEC intestinal cytokine profile. 10 The phospholipid inflammatory mediator, platelet-activating factor, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of NEC. Erythropoietin is a trophic hormone that protects against intestinal cell death and was found to have a protective role, as did epidermal growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor. 11",

The increasing rate of CS in our institution, together with the fact that all the study infants except one were born by CS, either elective or urgent, might suggest that CS plays a role in the pathogenesis of NEC.
