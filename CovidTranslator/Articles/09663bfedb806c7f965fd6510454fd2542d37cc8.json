            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the first coronavirus described, has been a continuing problem in poultry for more than 70 years. IBV, causing a highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens, resembles the recently described severe acute respiratory syndrome virus in pathogenesis and genome organization. While previous studies demonstrated that effector and memory CD8 C T lymphocytes are critical in controlling acute IBV infection and disease in chickens, here chicken anti-IBV antibody (IgG) secreting cells (ASC) in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and spleens collected following IBV Gray infection were evaluated using an ELISPOT assay. The ASC in peripheral blood and spleens can be detected from 3 to 7 days post-infection (p.i.), which is 3-7 days earlier than anti-IBV IgG detected in the serum. The ASC frequency reached a maximum at 7-10 days p.i., and decreased more than 90% in the spleen and 70% in PBMC by 14 days p.i. The ASC levels in the PBMC then decreased gradually to 0.5 ASC/10 6 over the next 8 weeks. The higher concentration of about 20 ASC/10 6 cells in spleens may, at least partially, account for the presence of antibody in the serum although bone marrow ASC were not determined. In vitro stimulation of PBMC and splenocytes with IBV antigen demonstrated that memory B cells can be activated to secrete antibody by 3 weeks p.i. ELISPOT detection of primary B cells could be useful in the early detection of infection following infection with respiratory coronaviruses. q",

IBV specific memory T cells can be generated at 3 weeks p.i., and adoptive transfer of the memory T cells passed protection to the recipient chicks [22] . Innate immunity may also be instrumental in controlling IBV infection. Chicken interferon type I (ChIFN-I) inhibits IBV replication in vitro and in vivo [23] . Local administration of ChIFN-I inhibited IBV associated respiratory illness [23] . The importance of humoral immunity was indicated by Cook et al. (1991) , who demonstrated that after IBV infection, bursectomised chicks suffered more severe and longer illness than intact chicks. The viral titers in tissues were also higher and lasted longer in bursectomised chicks than in normal chicks [7] .",

However, the precise role of antibody in the control of IBV infection remains controversial. Some reports have shown that circulating antibody titer did not correlate with protection from IBV infection [11, 12, 24] . However, other studies demonstrated that humoral immunity plays an important role in disease recovery and virus clearance [7, 37, 38] . In our own studies, although the transfer of MHC compatible immune T cells eliminated initial illness and viral replication, mild illness was observed following the acute stage of infection [22, 30] . Therefore, total recovery involves other mechanisms in addition to T cells. The current study revealed that the ASC frequency in spleens and peripheral blood reached maximum levels between 7 and 10 days p.i., correlating with the maximum virus load in the lungs [29] , suggesting that ASC are available early in chicks after IBV infection, although their role in antibody production at this time is not know.",

Memory B cells in peripheral blood and spleens could be detected by 3 weeks, and as late as 10 weeks, p.i. This is also the first report of direct detection of avian memory B cells, and the evaluation of the frequencies of avian antibody secreting B cells in peripheral blood. Wu et al. detected ASC in chicken spleens after infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) infection using ELI-SPOT assay [42] . Although they did not determine the dynamics of the generation of ASC after virus infection, the IgG ASC frequency at 14 days p.i.

Similar to the T cell responses described in chickens [22, 29] , three distinct stages can be observed in the chicken B cell response: expansion, decreases in numbers, and memory (Fig. 3) . At the first stage, the IBV specific ASC expanded dramatically and reached a maximum between 7 and 10 days p.i. During this time, IBV in vivo infection increases to its maximum titer [6] . After 10 days infection, the virus was cleared by the host immune system. As in T cell responses, following antigen depletion, the IBV specific ASC response entered the second stage when the numbers decreased precipitously, perhaps as a result of apoptosis. In the third stage, a low level of residual memory B cells were generated and could be detected at 3 weeks p.i., similar to the maintenance of memory T cells [22] .",

Interestingly, the ASC frequency reached a maximum at 7-10 days p.i., while the antibody in the sera was barely detectable at 7 days p.i. and became unquestionably positive only by 10 days p.i. or beyond. When the ASC frequencies were decreasing between 10 and 14 days, the serum antibody was increasing. Therefore, serum antibody did not correlate with clinical illness or viral titers. However, the ASC frequency in this study and effector T cells shown in previous studies did correlate [6] . Although the lower levels of antibody, detected in the sera at 7-10 days p.i., could be saturated by the presence of maximum levels of virus in vivo, plasma B cells may not have matured until later. The decrease in primary ASC may be a consequence of the decreasing levels of antigen stimulation as the virus is eliminated from the host by cellular mechanisms. It is possible that continued presence of initial B, as well as T, cell numbers depends on the presence of antigen or that activated B cells have migrated elsewhere. While B cell function certainly depends on the levels of secreted specific antibody. Local specific IgA and IgM in the early infection might also be involved in controlling IBV infection, and their role should be addressed in the future [25, 29, 37, 39] . Furthermore, the levels of neutralizing antibody were not examined.",
