            "text": "Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) fill the role of a scaffold in the creation of biomimetic materials. They possess the well-known bioinert properties of gold, 8 occupy a size regime ranging from that of small to large biomacromolecules, 9, 10 and can be conjugated to nearly any organic compound or mixture of compounds that contain a free thiol, 11, 12 amine, 13 or phosphine. 14 Our focus has been on the monolayer-protected AuNP, defined as a nanoscale gold core surrounded by a dense self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of gold-thiolate complexes. 15, 16 These AuNPs are effectively core-shell nanomaterials, in which the organic shell is responsible for biomimetic interactions. The gold-thiolate monolayer confers additional stability on the AuNP, protecting it sterically and electronically from decomposition, aggregation, and other irreversible reactions. 11 AuNPs have been synthesized with a variety of protecting thiolate ligands. 11, 12, 17 The termini of the conjugated ligands extend from the metal core, giving the AuNP the desired solubility and determining other physiochemical interactions with the media. The use of a polar, hydrophilic organic ligand shell yields water-soluble AuNPs in a basic form. 17, 18 The shell can be made more complex by adding other thiolate ligands during 19, 20 or after 21 the reductive formation of the AuNPs, or by modifying the ligands through chemical reactions. 12 This allows for the selective addition of desired properties and chemical functionalities to the AuNP. By precisely engineering the organic shell 22,23 the shell can be tuned for selective binding or to avoid binding altogether. [24] [25] [26] The size of the AuNP core affects interactions between the organic shell and its environment. The size of the AuNP can be made similar in scale to various biological macromolecules such as enzymes, receptors, immunoglobulins, antigens, DNA, and carbohydrates. Choosing an optimal size can create greater specificity toward biomolecules with given secondary structural features. 27 The size of the core also determines the projection of the monolayer into its surrounding environment. Smaller monolayer-protected AuNPs (approx. <2 nm core diameter) with higher surface curvature are less protected sterically than larger analogues. The greater exposure of the individual protecting ligands and the core-shell interface leads to increased reactivity compared to larger AuNPs. 21, 28, 29 As the size of the AuNP increases, the surface curvature decreases. More dense ligand shells cause ligand termini to be more responsible for chemical interactions. 23 Because of these properties monolayer-protected AuNPs are an ideal biomimetic tool. The use of monolayer-protected AuNPs for biomimicry originated with the concept of integrating biologically active molecules, such as small molecule drugs, 30 enzyme cofactors, 18 DNA, 31,32 saccharides, 33 and peptides 12, 34, 35 into the monolayer. The latter has been dominant in biomimetic applications because of the importance of protein interactions in biological systems and the ease of integrating cysteine-bearing synthetic peptides into the monolayer. The following is a review of our research into the development of biomimetic monolayer-protected AuNPs for immunorecognition. Results of some recent work are also presented, and areas for future exploration will be discussed.",

The mixture is then reduced by sodium borohydride and allowed to stir or sit for several hours. The size of the AuNPs can be controlled by the manipulation of several variables in the synthetic scheme. Specifically, the diameter of AuNPs correlates with the AuCl 4 \u2212 -to-ligand ratio, reaction temperature, and the reductant-to-AuCl 4 \u2212 ratio. 37 The AuNP product can be purified by precipitation, centrifugation, solvent washes, electrophoresis, and/or dialysis. The core and shell of the AuNPs can then be modified. The core size can be decreased by adding large quantities of free thiol to the AuNPs, 38 or increased by the use of other additives. 39 The shell can be modified by simple organic reactions. 12 An easier and more common modification route is the addition of free thiolbearing molecules to promote ligand exchange. 21 Integrating biomolecules into the monolayer is facilitated by functionalization with cysteine or another thiol. In some cases an inert spacer, such as a short peptide fragment, oligoethylene glycol, or alkyl chain, is added to allow epitope presentation without interference from the rest of the organic shell.",

This novel material could also be studied as a non-infectious calibration standard for a number of HRSV immunosensors. The performance of this mimic can be improved by further tuning of the AuNP scaffold, specifically by altering the size of the gold core, the primary ligands in the monolayer, and the peptide loading in the monolayer.",

Drawing from research by Brust and co-workers 73 and Feldheim and coworkers, 74 we integrated a short thioalkylated polymer, mercaptoundecyltetraethylene glycol (MUTEG) into the monolayer in order to enhance biocompatibility. The mixed-ligand Tio:MUTEG AuNPs yielded drastically reduced toxicity, 72 indicating that the tiopronin ligand is responsible for the toxicity. It was suggested that the carboxylate termini produce a strong negative charge at the surface of the ligand shell at physiological pH, inducing unintended interactions with biomolecules. 26 Reducing the charge by replacing carboxylate-terminated ligands with alcohol-terminated ligands was thought to reduce the charge sufficiently to eliminate the toxic effects.",

This indicates more complex surface effects: either the carboxylate alone was not responsible for toxicity, or the added MTEG acid altered aggregation or serum protein adsorption behaviour. These biologically-induced processes have not yet been studied for these AuNPs, but are known to affect interaction with macrophages and other downstream effects. 76 Tetraethylene glycol ligands are roughly double the length of tiopronin ligands: the ligand tails which extend beyond the tiopronin shell may effectively shield the tiopronin carboxylates, reducing the interactions which lead to toxicity.",

The ability to harness nanoscale structure in the organic shell provides a greatly expanded versatility which can both accelerate success and open up new avenues of research into biologically useful nanomaterials. The practically endless possibilities for complex chemistry lead to applications in areas much more diverse than what has been detailed here. Because of their versatility and ease of use, the future of monolayer-protected AuNP-based applications consists of numerous ideas waiting to be explored.",

A cysteine-appended epitope is integrated into the protecting organic shell of a hydrophilic monolayer-protected AuNP by ligand exchange. The gold electrode on a QCM chip is functionalized with a protein matrix (1) designed to immobilize the selected antibody while resisting non-specific binding to the biomimic. The antibody (2) is added, and subsequently the biomimetic AuNP (3) is brought into contact with the chip. After each addition, the chip is washed to ensure the elimination of non-specifically bound material. Observed mass increase in the final step that is not washed away is indicative of immunorecognition via biomimic-antibody binding. AuNPs. Blood and urine are collected regularly, and organs are collected at the end of the study. The concentration of gold in each is measured by inductively-coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), and any immune response is observed by an increase in white blood cell counts. Monolayer-protected AuNPs that have been tested in vivo, including those protected by various mercaptan tetraethylene glycols (MTEG), such as ligands with an alkyl linker region (mercaptoundecyl-TEG, or MUTEG) and those with carboxylic acid termini (MTEG acid). Organ retention is listed in order of highest to lowest Au concentration. Only tiopronin-protected AuNPs have been found to be toxic, and most of the variants have safely cleared the system without generating an immune response in se. This is a desirable trait,",
