All viruses must therefore express their genes as functional mRNAs early in infection in order to direct the cellular translational machinery to synthesize viral proteins. The pathways leading from genome to message vary among different viruses ( Fig. 3.1 ). As shown in Chapter 2, Virion Structure, Genome Organization, and Taxonomy of Viruses, viral genomes are quite different from cellular genomes, which consist uniformly of dsDNA. Viral genomes provide examples of almost every structural variation imaginable. There are four main categories of viral genomes: dsDNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, and ssRNA. These categories are further divided on the basis of distinct modes of transcription. For some RNA viruses, the infecting genome acts as mRNA. For other RNA and DNA viruses, viral mRNA is synthesized upon entry into the host cell.",

Once inside a cell, the enzymes transcribe one of the RNA strands of the dsRNA genome to ssRNA(1) within the virion, which upon release into the cytoplasm (through channels in the virion) is translated by the host cell machinery. In addition, these ssRNA(1) can act as a template for (2) RNA strand synthesis that is converted back into a dsRNA genome for packaging. Whereas DNA viruses need only to generate mRNA, these RNA viruses without a DNA stage have to synthesize both viral RNA and mRNA. The viral RNA is generated through a replication intermediate, referred to as the \"antigenome\" or \"minus\" (2) strand, which serves as a template for viral RNA synthesis. Single-stranded RNA genomes, however, exist in two forms: either the sense or the \"plus\" (1) strand or the nonsense or \"minus\" (2) strand. ssRNA(1) genomes act as mRNA, are infectious upon entry into host cells, and are immediately translated into protein, including the enzymes required for viral reproduction. On the other hand, (2) RNA, which is not mRNA, requires a virus-encoded RNA-replicating enzyme that is carried within the virion, to copy (2) RNA to monocistronic (1) RNA that is recognized by the host cell translation machinery. The enzyme also synthesizes viral (progeny) genome using the (1) RNA as template. The other class of (1) RNA viruses is the retroviruses. Here, the virion carries an enzyme that converts the ssRNA(1) into dsDNA upon infection. The virus genome integrates into the host genome and can be passed from parent to offspring should integration occur in germline cells. The integrated virus genome, referred to as a provirus, is transcribed as a cellular gene (some may require splicing) and translated by the cellular synthesis machinery on export to the cytoplasm. Some full-length ssRNA(1) transcripts are packaged into new retrovirus virions. It should be noted that in all these examples, the balance between the processes of transcription and genome replication must be properly maintained to allow efficient viral proliferation. It appears that the transition occurs by the (1) action of trans-acting proteins that are either absent, or at low levels in virions, but which accumulate over the course of infection; (2) regulatory role of promoter RNA secondary structure along with the action of specific viral (e.g., capsid) and host cellular factors; (3) alteration of the virus RNA synthesizing enzyme complex that changes its role as \"transcriptase\" to a \"replicase\"; or (4) a combination of the above.",

Cellular splicing machinery typically generates mature viral mRNAs.

The rate by which mutations occur is universally determined as the number of nucleotide substitutions per base per generation. DNA viruses experience low mutation rates. Their DNA polymerase has an error rate of approximately 10 26 to 10 28 mutations per base pair per generation. This is because of the proofreading ability of the polymerase. A 3 0 to 5 0 proofreading exonuclease domain is intrinsic to most DNA polymerases. It allows the enzyme to verify each inserted nucleotide during DNA synthesis and excise mismatched nucleotides in a 3 0 to 5 0 direction. With the exception of nidoviruses, the replicative enzymes of RNA viruses (RdRps) lack proofreading ability and these viruses exhibit the highest mutation rates. RNA viruses possess an error rate of approximately 10 24 to 10 26 mutations per base pair per generation. Not all mutations generated will persist in a virus population, however. Mutations may be neutral or silent (because of genetic code redundancy) and those that interfere with viral replicative mechanisms are eliminated from the viral population. Mutations that do not affect essential viral functions may persist and eventually become fixed within the viral population (see Chapter 4: Origins and Evolution of Viruses).",

The DNA polymerase involved must exhibit a high level of processivity and strand displacement characteristics. Upon infection, a complementary strand designated as the (2) strand is generated by host enzymes from the virus' ssDNA genome that is referred to as the (1) strand. A duplex or replicative form (RF) results. Subsequently, a viral endonuclease enzyme (Rep protein) produces a nick in the (1) strand of the RF, exposing a free 3 0 end and a free 5 0 end. DNA synthesis begins by addition of deoxyribonucleotides by DNA polymerase to the free 3 0 end of the (1) strand using the (2) strand as template. The (2) strand revolves while serving as template hence the name rolling circle. The addition of nucleotides displaces the free 5 0 end outward in the form of a free tail. Once the entire (2) strand template is copied, the (1) strand tail is cut into correct genome lengths by an endonuclease to provide many copies of free, linear DNA molecules. The latter are eventually by joined DNA ligase to form closed, circular ssDNA molecules. The RF can be used to generate mRNA for the manufacture viral proteins. The RCR mechanism is also thought to be important in the replication of dsDNA viruses such as herpesviruses ( Fig. 3 .2).

Here, the genomic RNA is reverse transcribed into dsDNA. A RNA:DNA duplex is produced, which is then resolved by degradation of the RNA by the virus-encoded RNase H. Only a small stretch of polypurines is resistant to degradation and this serves as a primer to initiate the synthesis of the cDNA. The cDNA, integrated into the host cell's genome, is now referred to as a provirus and undergoes cellular transcription and translational processes to express viral genes. Integration is a key event in the replicative process of all retroviruses. Integration is signaled after the RNA genome of these viruses is reverse transcribed into ds linear, viral DNA. Linear viral DNA contains termini long terminal repeats (LTRs) sequences at the 3 0 and 5 0 ends, which are specifically recognized by the viral integrase (IN) enzyme. In some retroviruses, nuclear localization signals facilitate migration to the nucleus. Depending upon the retrovirus, preintegration complexes either enter the nuclei of nondividing cells through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (e.g., HIV) or enter when the nuclear membrane dissolves during cell division [e.g. Moloney murine sarcoma virus, (Murine leukemia virus)]. Once inside the nucleus and after association with host chromosomes, viral IN catalyzes insertion of viral sequences into the host DNA (Fig. 3.3) . The LTR sequences at the 3 0 and 5 0 ends of the linear viral DNA are joined to the host's DNA in two steps called end-processing and end-joining. After successful integration of the viral DNA into the host DNA, cellular repair proteins fill the gap and ligate the DNA ends. Autointegration is prevented by cellular proteins (HMG family of proteins for High Mobility Group proteins, and BAF for Barrier to Autointegration Factor). Retroviruses have different target sites of integration; for example, lentivirus DNA insertion occurs preferentially in active transcription units (TUs), whereas Murine leukemia virus integrates at or close to promoter regions located at the 5 0 terminus of CpG and TUs islands.",

As alluded to in the previous sections, many viral transcripts have marked structural differences from cellular mRNAs that preclude translation initiation, such as the absence of a 5 0 cap structure or the presence of highly structured 5 0 untranslatable leader regions containing replication and/or packaging signals. Furthermore, while the great majority of cellular mRNAs are monocistronic, viruses must often express multiple proteins from their mRNAs.

However, the use of these mechanisms is not without consequences: (1) some viral proteins may be expressed from sgRNAs but the components of the replication complex that are needed early in infection must still be translated from the genomic RNA, (2) viruses with segmented genomes have to ensure the correct packaging of the different segments, and (3) polyprotein expression represents an inefficient use of host cell resources as all virus proteins are produced in equal amounts, even though catalytic proteins are often required in much smaller quantities than the structural proteins. Alternative and more efficient mechanisms of expressing multiple proteins from a single viral mRNA involve internal ribosome entry, leaky scanning, ribosome shunting, reinitiation, ribosomal frameshifting, and stop codon read-through. In addition, several viruses have evolved proteins and/or RNA structural elements that further enhance translation of the viral mRNAs.

The processed 5 0 end is important because the 5 0 cap is the site for the assembly of the translation initiation complex, and it protects and stabilizes the mRNA strand from 5 0 -3 0 exonucleolytic degradation when it is exported out the nucleus and into the cytoplasm for translation. The scanning process to locate the start codon for initiation of translation begins at the 5 0 end, and the 5 0 cap sequence allows immune recognition of foreign RNAs (including viral transcripts) as \"nonself.\" Cap snatching refers to a mechanism used by ssRNA(2) viruses that are incapable of synthesizing their own 5 0 cap. Cap snatching involves cleavage of a short nucleotide sequence, 10\u00c020 nts in length, from the 5 0 end of cellular mRNAs (Fig. 3.5) . The capping apparatus can be either host-or virus-derived. If virus-encoded, cleavage is carried out by the endonuclease activity of the viral RdRp. Sequence complementarity shared between the nucleotides within the cleavage site of the donor mRNA and the viral RNA facilitates successful cap snatching. Members of the Arenaviridae and the Orthomyxoviridae families, along with most if not all of those of the order Bunyavirales, steal the 5 0 capped ends of host mRNAs to incorporate this cis-acting stability element into their own transcripts.

An RNA domain, called the Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES), enables cap-independent initiation of translation, and can allow initiation of translation at a site not specific to the 5 0 cap. IRES elements are important to viruses without a 5 0 cap as they allow ribosome recruitment under conditions where cap-dependent protein synthesis is severely repressed. Cripavirus IRES also allows translation initiation on an alanine or glutamine tRNA and not necessarily the methionine tRNA. Downstream hairpin loops are RNA structures that facilitate initiation of capdependent translation in the absence of eIF2 translation initiation factors. In addition, the physiological state of the infected cell dictates whether host mRNA transcripts undergo cap-dependent translation or capindependent translation. When the cell exhibits normal housekeeping functions, translation of cellular mRNAs is carried out by a cap-dependent mechanism; however, under stressful conditions, such as heat shock, viral infection, hypoxia, and irradiation, the translation mechanism switches from cap dependency to IRES-driven mechanisms. Infection by a range of viruses induces the activation of the ER stress response, resulting in the stimulation of IRES-dependent translation. This switch is widely observed in picornaviruses since their viral mRNA transcripts do not contain the m7G cap at their 5 0 ends. As such, viruses containing IRES are able to efficiently benefit from the host cells ER stress response for their own multiplication. Inhibition of cap-dependent translation of cellular mRNAs by either viral infections or stress factors is achieved by (1) specific cleavage of cellular translation initiation factors by HIV and picornaviral proteases, or cellular caspases, (2) active phosphorylation of factors and cofactors of translation, such as eIF2\u03b1, (3) excessive production of the cap-binding protein eIF4E, which interacts with eIF4G and results in the impairment of the eIF4 complex, and (iv) restriction of eIF4E function by activation of microRNAs which, again, disrupts the assembly of the eIF4 complex.",

Alternative splicing is regulated by cellular and viral proteins that modulate the activity of the splicing factors U1 and U2, both of which are components of the spliceosome. The spliceosome is made up of the snRNAs (small nuclear RNAs) U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6, together with various regulatory factors.

Some of these signals include donor splice sites (5 0 terminus), acceptor splice sites (3 0 terminus), polypyrimidine tracts, and branch point sites. Serine/arginine-rich proteins, as well as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, play a key role in splice site recognition. Alternative splicing (1) increases the virus' ability to encode several proteins in a given transcript (e.g., adenoviruses and retroviruses can encode B12 different peptides from one pre-mRNA), (2) is a mechanism to regulate early and late expression for viruses (e.g., papillomaviruses), and (3) splicing is coupled to export of mRNA out of the nucleus.

All DNA viruses replicate within the nucleus except poxviruses, asfarviruses, and phycodnaviruses. Few RNA viruses, including bornaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and retroviruses, replicate in the nucleus. Trafficking between the nucleus and cytoplasm is usually unidirectional for large macromolecules like the mRNA transcript, and occurs through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Viruses that replicate in the nucleus must out-compete cellular mRNAs to export viral mRNAs out of the nucleus for translation into virus gene products in the cytoplasm. Several viruses can inhibit nuclear export of cellular mRNAs by FIGURE 3.11 Inhibition of cellular mRNA export out of the nucleus by targeted disruption of the structure of the NPC. One half of the NPC is shown in the diagram. Vesiculoviruses are negative-stranded (2) RNA viruses that prevent proper cellular mRNA export by interfering with the action of the VSV matrix (M) protein. This effect decreases competition of viral mRNAs with cellular mRNAs for use of the translational machinery. Many DNA viruses (e.g., adenoviruses) also selectively inhibit host mRNA export, while ensuring that viral mRNAs are efficiently exported after transcription (Yarbrough et al., 2014) . Viruses: PV, Poliovirus; HRV, Human rhinovirus; HHV, Human herpesvirus; TMEV, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. disrupting nuclear export receptors (exportin1 and TIP-associated protein) and nucleoporins that comprise the NPC to compromise their function in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of cellular mRNA.",

Most viruses produce an endonuclease that cleaves host mRNAs, which are then degraded by host exonucleases (e.g., Xrn1 in mammals). The mRNA fragments are then degraded by mRNA decay pathways (nonsense-mediated decay), and exosomal degradation. Human gammaherpesvirus 8, Human alphaherpesvirus 1, and Influenza A virus all induce destruction of cellular mRNAs. Betacoronaviruses, influenza viruses, vaccinia viruses, and herpesviruses can produce viral endonucleotyic products to an extent that saturates cellular RNA decay-related quality control mechanisms and limit their function.

Some cellular chaperones, for example, Hsp70, are used to accelerate the maturation of viral proteins and are involved in regulating the viral biological cycle. The high rate of mutation in RNA viruses may mean an increased dependency on chaperones for the gene products of these viruses. Hsp70 can refold denatured proteins, which negates some of the destabilizing alterations in structural proteins as a result of mutated genes.

As such, in order for HCV to create replication compartments and increase sites of assembly, the RNA virus requires both the synthesis of fatty acids, for example, cholesterol, sphingolipids, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine, and formation of lipid droplets. Lipids are especially required for assembly of virions of enveloped viruses as these molecules are a major component of membranes. Cellular lipid metabolism is affected at three levels: enhanced lipogenesis, impaired degradation, and disruption of export, which is subsequently manifested in the host as HCV-associated pathogenesis.

Viral interference of the host cell cycle can result in the dysregulation of cell cycle checkpoint control mechanisms to promote viral replication and to facilitate efficient virion assembly.

Retroviruses and other RNA viruses also interfere with the host cell cycle. Viral-mediation of the cell cycle can increase the efficiency of viral gene expression and virion assembly.

Many viruses encode a cyclin-D homolog protein (v-cyclin) that associates with Cdk6 to phosphorylate Rb, which regulates G1 phase. The EBV-EBNA2 and EBV-LP, HTLV-1-Tax, and HBV-HBx proteins upregulate cyclin D, which leads to Rb hyperphosphorylation and TFIIF-mediated transcriptional activation. Distinct viral families are able to target the Rb/TFIIF association and promote the premature or unscheduled transition of the infected host cell into the S phase. Other viruses utilize mechanisms that result in G2/M arrest through either inactivation of Cdk1 at the G2/M checkpoint and/or at the interference with mitotic progression. Viruses can also dysregulate mitosis through the activity of viral oncoproteins such as HTLV-1-Tax, Ad-E1A, and HPV-E6/E7, which serve to induce chromosomal aberrations and chromosome mis-segregation that ultimately can result in apoptosis of the cell. Various DNA viruses primarily infect quiescent or differentiated cells, which contain low levels of deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) as these cells do not undergo active cell division. As such, a restricted pool of dNTPs will not provide an ideal environment for viral replication. It has been proposed that such viruses can induce quiescent cells to enter the cell cycle, specifically the S phase, in order to create an environment that generates factors, such as nucleotides, that are required for viral replication. Large DNA viruses, for example, herpesviruses, can cause cell cycle arrest as a mean of competing for cellular DNA replication resources.",

Typically, these macromolecules are recruited and concentrated into specific cytoplasmic or nuclear compartments. Formation of such specialized cellular microenvironments, also termed viroplasms, virus factories, virus replication centers, complexes, or compartments, requires the coordinated control of cellular biosynthesis in addition to (1) alterations in the dynamics and distribution of the cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins, (2) relocalization of cellular organelles, and (3) reorganization and redeployment of cellular membranes associated with membrane-bound organelles, for example, the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, chloroplasts, Golgi apparatus, endosomes, and lysosomes in eukaryotes. Formation of viral factories often requires sequestration of mitochondria (and/or chloroplasts) and chaperones to perinuclear sites. In addition, DNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus induce nuclear reorganization and redistribution of chromatin and nuclear domain components such as the nucleolus, interchromatin granules, and Cajal bodies. These compartments provide a scaffold for efficient viral gene expression, while simultaneously concealing viral genomes (refer to Chapter 10: Host\u00c0Virus Interactions: Battles Between Viruses and Their Hosts) and their products from immunological detection.",
