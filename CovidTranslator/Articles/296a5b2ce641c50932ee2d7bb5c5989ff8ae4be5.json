            "text": "Triterpene saponins represent one of the most common classes of plant natural products with broad spectra of biological and pharmacological activities [1] . Glycyrrhizic acid (GA, I) is a bioactive saponin from roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra L. and G. uralensis Fisher (Leguminosae) and is known to have anti-inflammatory, antiulcer, anti-allergic, antidote, antitumor, and immunotropic activity [2] . GA is one of the leading natural glycosides and is a promising scaffold for designing new non-toxic antiviral agents [3, 4] . GA inhibits HIV-1, influenza A virus, Epstein-Barr, herpes, hepatitis B and C, SARS-associated coronavirus, etc. [5 -8] . GA possessed a new mechanism of antiviral activity, exhibiting activity during the early stages of the virus replication cycle and stimulating \u00e3-interferon production [9] . The structural similarity of GA and 11-ketosteroids (conjugated 11-on-12ene system in the triterpene part) is responsible for their similar biological activity. Prolonged administration of high doses of GA and its salts induces mineralocorticoid activity, affects water-salt exchange, enhances Na + retention, and lowers the in vivo K + content (pseudoaldosteronism) [2] . Therefore, the synthesis of GA analogs with a reduced 11-oxo group is of interest to structure-activity relationship studies.",

Resulting glycoside V was dehydrated without preliminary isolation using aqueous HCl (5%) instead of HCl solution (2%) in aqueous dioxane. The mixture was acidified (pH 1 -2) at room temperature and stirred for 1 h. The product was extracted by n-BuOH to afford crude product (mixture of glycosides) containing 37.5 -39.5% of GA analog homodiene II according to HPLC (Table 1 ).

The resulting samples were separated by CC over SG with gradient elution by CHCl 3 :MeOH:H 2 O (see Experimental). Glycoside II was isolated pure in yields of 34 -36% and was characterized by IR and NMR spectra. It was also converted to the known trimethyl ester IV [12] . The IR spectrum of II was missing an absorption maximum for an 11-on-12-ene. The PMR spectrum contained two singlets for the olefinic protons (H11 and H12) with chemical shifts (CS) 5.58 and 5.62 ppm (Me 2 CO-d 6 ) . The 13 C NMR spectrum was characterized by new resonances for the olefinic C atoms at weak field of 156.2 (C9), 117.1 (C11), 122.2 (C12), and 147.8 ppm (C13). This agreed with the literature [12] .",

Dose-dependent curves were constructed using the results. The quantitative inhibition characteristics were calculated as IC 50 , the concentration of the compound suppressing virus production by 50% or protecting 50% of cells from death due to infection; IC 90 , the concentration of the compound suppressing virus production by 90% or protecting 90% of cells from death due to infection; SI, the selectivity index, i.e., the ratio of CC 50 and its effective concentration IC 50 .
