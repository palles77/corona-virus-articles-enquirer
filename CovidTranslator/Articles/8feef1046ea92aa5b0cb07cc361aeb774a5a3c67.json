Although almost 50% of children experiences wheeze in the first 6 years of life, only 40% of them will report continued wheezing symptoms after childhood. The classification of wheeze in preschool children is more difficult compared to school aged children. It is based on the onset and duration of symptoms and divided children in three categories: transient early wheezing, non-atopic wheezing and atopic wheezing/asthma. History and physical examination, skin prick test, exhaled nitric oxide, lung function test are the parameter to evaluate children with wheezing. The aim of management of wheezing is to finalize the control of symptoms, reduce exacerbations and improve the quality of life. All guidelines underline the complexity in making a diagnosis of asthma under five years and the need to identify phenotypes that may help paediatricians in the therapeutic choices.",

Episodic (viral) wheeze is the most common phenotype in preschool children and it is characterized by distinct wheezing episodes with child being asymptomatic between episodes. Usually, it is associated with seasonal viral infection such as RSV, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus and adenovirus. The frequency and severity of episodes are related to the severity of the first episode, atopy, prematurity and exposure to environmental factors such as tobacco smoke. Episodic wheeze declines over time disappearing within the age of 6 years, can continue as episodic wheeze in school age, change into multiple trigger wheeze or disappear later. Multiple-trigger wheeze is the second phenotype caused by the exposition to viruses or other important triggers such as cigarette smoking and allergen exposure, some children may also wheeze in response to spray, crying, laughter and exercise [12] .",

Although no evidence is available regarding the usefulness of physical examination in wheeze assessment, it is important to recognize unusual or atypical features that would suggest another underlying condition [13] . A clinical index has been also proposed to define the risk of asthma development in the single patient according to the criteria of the Asthma Predictive Index (API) [16] . This index is based on the identification of risk factors during the first 3 years of life for development of asthma at school age. A positive API at age of 3 years is associated with 76% of chance of asthma development, compared with a less than 5% chance of active asthma at school age in children with a negative API index [16] .",

As clearly indicated in the GINA guidelines, good levels of control consider only minimal symptoms as acceptable [26] . To achieve and maintain this target, patients should be reviewed three months after the initial assessment and then every three months. In the case of an exacerbation, a follow-up visit should be scheduled within two-four weeks [27] . In a study conducted in younger children, it was observed that clinicians are likely to obtain important and complementary information from children and their parents about symptoms reports and quality of life measures [28] . For these reasons, the childhood asthma control test (C-ACT) was recently validated and proposed as an accurate and a reliable tool, complementary to lung function testing, to assess the level of disease control in asthmatic children [29] . However C-ACT should be used as a complement to, and not as an alternative to, other tools such as spirometry and exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement in the evaluation of asthma control in children [30] . This is in keeping with the concept that, though a number of tools have been considered in the monitoring of childhood asthma, a combination of different ones is still recommended for the purpose of a comprehensive evaluation of the level of control [26] . Since asthma is primarily an inflammatory disease, the addition of a measure of inflammation, like FeNO determination, to standard spirometry and asthma control surveys may add novel information to assess asthma burden during the routine clinical follow-up of asthmatic children [20] .",

Some studies demonstrate the lack efficacy of a short course of systemic steroid therapy in post-viral episodic wheezing [32] . Panickar et al [33] have shown that the treatment with prednisone in children with mild to moderate virus-induced wheezing did not improve the symptoms of wheezing. Moreover, Ducharme et al [34] demonstrated that in preschool-age children with moderate-to-severe virus-induced wheezing, preventive treatment with high-dose fluticasone reduced the use of rescue oral corticosteroids. Nevertheless, since 10% of children have more than 10 viral colds per years and symptoms may last 2 weeks or more, some children would receive a large cumulative dose of oral corticosteroids with potential adverse effects, this therapeutic strategy should not be recommended in clinical practice. On the basis of these two studies [35] the administration of prednisolone to preschoolers without atopy who have episodic wheezing is not recommended, unless wheezing is severe enough to require admission to an intensive care unit.",
