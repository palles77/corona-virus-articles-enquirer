A Y-untranslated segment of 341 nucleotides precedes a continuous ORF of 9030/9033 nucleotides which is followed by a 54 nucleotides long 3'-non-coding segment. Further work is required to resolve the question of whether the genomic RNA possesses a 3'-poly(U) or poty(A) tail. The genome also carries an internal poly(A) segment towards the 5'-end of its ORF. Genomic RNA is probably translated into a single polyprotein of 3010/3011 amino acids which is processed into functional proteins. The viral proteins have not been identified, but on the basis of the predicted amino acid sequences, hydrophobicity plots, location of potential glycosylation sites and similarities of these properties to those of pesti-and flaviviruses, the following genome organization has been predicted. The predicted viral structural proteins, a nucleocapsid protein and two envelope glycoproteins are located at the aminoterminal end of the polyprotein. They are followed by a highly hydrophobic protein and proteins that exhibit proteinase, helicase and replicase domains and thus are probably involved in RNA replication and protein processing. The replicase domain is located close to the carboxy terminus of the polyprotein.",

On the other hand, viral RNA can be detected in plasma by reverse transcription and amplification of the cDNA by PCR within a few days post infection.

Attempts to infect various cell culture systems or small laboratory animals have been unsuccessful. However, HepCV can be readily transmitted by parental injection to chimpanzees which have served for years as primary model system for NANBH [see 7, 9, 14] . Chimpanzees also developed hepatitis after injection of Factor VIII concentrate and Factor IX complex that had been implicated in the transmission of NANBH to human recipients and NANBH was serially transmitted by parental injection from chimpanzee to chimpanzee [see 8, 9-1. The clinical disease in chimpanzees mimics that observed in humans, but may vary greatly between individual humans or chimpanzees. Infections often remain asymptomatic. When acute illness develops, it generally occurs 7-14 weeks p.i. and consists of a range of symptoms including fever, chills, headache, weakness and jaundice. After parenteral or non-parenteral transmission HepCV infections seem to be mainly localized in the liver since tissue damage seems limited to this tissue [7-1.",

Also many endothelial cells were found to contain peculiar bundles of hexagonal-packed microtubules, which, when sectioned, resembled arrays of 25 nm particles. Some of these ultrastructural changes; however, are not unique to HepCV infections; similar changes have been observed in cells infected with other RNA viruses [reviewed in 9] and may represent general responses of cells to cytotoxic effects of these viruses. Monoclonal antibodies have been generated that specifically interact with tubular aggregates in liver biopsies of NANBH and hepatitis delta virus-infected chimpanzees [41, 42] .

            "text": "The mechanism of liver injury is not fully understood and factors other than cytocidal replication of HepCV in hepatocytes may be involved. Liver injury is usually associated with an inflammatory reaction and marked increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity in the circulation, which are general features reflecting liver injury. Elevated plasma ALT activity serves as general indicator of liver injury and is measured by blood banks in a \"surrogate\" assay to screen blood donors for potential infection by NANBH viruses [4, 9, 14] . The recent development of assays for antibodies to a HepCV polypeptide (C 100-3) that is part of the viral non-structural proteins (see below) has allowed studies on the humoral antibody response of HepCV-infected patients and chimpanzees. A recent study of stored blood samples from prospective studies of 15 U.S.A. patients with transfusion-associated chronic hepatitis documented by liver biopsies indicated that the time course of changes in plasma ALT activity and of the formation of anti-HepCV antibodies can vary considerably between patients [4] . A number of common features, however, were observed. In agreement with earlier studies, the onset of acute infection generally occurred between 5 and 10 weeks after transfusion and was associated with increases in plasma ALT activity of 10 fold or more as well as with increased serum bilirubin levels. All of the 15 patients developed anti-C 100-3 HepCV antibodies but only at an average of about 22 weeks after transfusion. However, high antibody levels persisted in all but one patient for at least 7-12 years. Serum ALT activity levels varied greatly between patients during the course of the chronic infection and a significant elevation was not always prevalent. Similarly, 88% of 16 donor sera tested contained significant anti-HepCV antibodies, but of the anti-HepCV antibody positive sera only 33% exhibited elevated ALT activity.",

The long latent period between HepCV infection and development of anti-C 100-3 antibodies in both humans and chimpanzees (4-32 weeks), however, indicates that a considerable time period exists when HepCV can be transmitted but not detected by the immunological test. Of interest is the question of whether the long latent period may reflect a late antibody response to the non-structural proteins measured by the anti-C 100-3 immune assay. Perhaps antibodies to the structural proteins of HepCV (see below) are formed more rapidly. Indeed, it has been reported that antibodies to the HepCV core protein were detected by Western blotting in a higher proportion of sera from patients with chronic NANBH (81%) than antibodies to the C 100-3 antigen (61%) [36] . In another recent study, 89% and 82% of sera from 65 chronic NANBH patients were positive for antibodies to HepC virus core protein and C 100 antigen, respectively [25] . Furthermore, in one NANBH PT patient, anti-core protein antibodies became first detectable in serum 8 weeks after transfusion, whereas antibodies to the C 100 antigen were first detected 13 weeks after transfusion [25] .",

Since the only HepCV titration assay available at present is an expensive endpoint dilution assay in chimpanzees or marmosets [see 9, 19] , only limited information is available on HepCV viremia in infected humans and chimpanzees over the course of the disease. Nevertheless, all data indicate that serum HepCV titers are generally low; i.e., < 10 3 chimpanzee infectious doses (CID)/ml. However, titers of up to 106 CID/ml of serum have been observed in plasma of selected chimpanzees during periods of exacerbated chronic phase disease [9] . Also, liver tissue from one of the animals contained about t 0 7 CID/g of tissue [9] and an unusual titer of at least 106 CID/ml has been observed in serum from one patient with acute NANBH (strain H) [19] .",

A similar incidence of serum anti-C 100-3 HepCV antibodies (64%) has been reported for another group of 33 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan [37] . Although these and similar results reported from the U.S.A. and Europe implicate chronic HepCV infections as the cause of hepatocellular carcinoma, potential mechanisms of this effect remain to be elucidated.

Electron microscopic examinations revealed togavirus-like particles with diameters of 36-62 nm in sera of chimpanzees and humans with chronic NANBH and similar particles were observed in cytoplasmic cisternae of hepatocytes of infected chimpanzees but the origin and identity of these particles has not been ascertained [1] . The virus-like particles detected by electron microscopy exhibited a buoyant density in sucrose density gradients of 1.14-1.18g/cm 3 [1] . In contrast, a buoyant density of 1.0%1.11 g/cm 3 was observed in sucrose density gradient centrifugations in which the gradient fractions were assayed for infectious HepCV by titration in chimpanzees (D. W. Bradley, pers. comm.). From other sedimentation analyses it has been concluded that the sedimentation coefficient of HepCV is < 150-200 S [7, 9] HepCV is an enveloped virus since its infectivity is destroyed by extraction with chloroform [10, 20] . Infectivity is also abolished by heating at 60 \u00b0C for 30min [39] .",

            "text": "The sequence of the HepCV RNA genome has been determined via sequencing of cDNAs [ 13, 27, 29, 44] . Initially a random-primed expression cDNA library in X gttl was prepared from RNA extracted from infectious material concentrated from a large volume of high titer plasma from a chimpanzee (see above) with a chronic NANBH infection. The animal represented the second chimpanzee passage of the virus present in a human Factor VIII concentrate [8, 9] . The cDNA library was screened with serum from a chronic NANBH patient as a potential source of antiviral antibodies [12] . A single positive clone (5-1-1; see Fig. 1 ) was identified among a total of about 10 6 clones. Using the 5-1-1 clone, a larger overlapping cDNA clone (81) was isolated. Clone 81 cDNA did not hybridize to human or chimpanzee cell DNA in Southern hybridization analyses, but it hybridized to RNA extracted from the liver of NANBH virus- [14] infected chimpanzees [12] . In Northern hybridization analyses, clone 81 cDNA hybridized to oligo(dT)-selected RNA in the 5 to 10kb range. The results indicated that the putative positive strand viral RNA isolated from infectious plasma had a size of at least 10 kb. The results also suggested that HepCV RNA contains a poly(A) sequence(s) but it is unclear whether its binding to 01igo(dT) is due to an internal or a 3'-terminal poly(A) sequence [6, 9, 13] (see below). Three additional cDNA clones were isolated from the original cDNA library using clone 5-1-1 cDNA as a probe and found to encode a continuous ORF [31] . A reconstructed clone (C 100) encoding this ORF (see Fig. I ) was fused to a human superoxide dismutase (SOD) cDNA (C 100-3), which facilitates the efficient expression of foreign proteins in yeast, and expressed as a fusion protein containing 363 amino acids in yeast. The SOD/HepCV polypeptide produced in yeast has been used to develop a radioimmune assay (RIA) and an ELISA for the assay of anti-HepCV antibodies [31] . Commercial ELISA kits are available from Ortho Diagnostic Systems (Raritan, NY) and Abbott Diagnostics (Chicago, IL). As discussed already, the assays have been used extensively already in prospective studies and in screening blood donors for serum anti-C 100 HepCV antibodies.",

In both studies virus particles were collected from plasma by ultracentrifugation, RNA was extracted from pelleted material and reverse transcribed and cDNA libraries prepared in k~ gttl. In one study, the viral RNA was reverse transcribed using appropriate antisense oligonucleotides as primers or the viral RNA was polyadenylated and reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) as primer [29] . In the other study, viral RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexanucleotide primers [44] . The 9413 nucleotides long sequence of HepCV-J RNA contains 5'-and 3'-terminal untranslated segments of 329 and 54 nucleotides in length, respectively (Table 1) . The genome of HepCV-KB is 9416 nucleotides long and possesses 332 and 54 nucleotides long 5'-and 3'-terminal untranslated segments ( Table 1 ). The 5'-untranslated segment of HepCV-1 is 12 and 9 nucleotides longer than those reported for HepCV-J and -KB, respectively. It may represent the true 5'-terminus of the HepCV genome since several independent clones had the same terminal sequence [24] . The Y-terminus can potentially form a hairpin structure with a calculated AG value of -14.4kcal [24] . The 5'-untranslated segment resembles those of pestiviruses, rather than those of flaviviruses, in its greater length and presence of short ORFs [13] . The HepCV 5'-untranslated segment encodes three ORFs of 12-15 amino acids [24] but no functions have been identified for these ORFs. In addition~ it exhibits considerable nucleotide homology (47-49%) with the 5'-untranslated segments of pestivirus genomes [13, 24, 47] . In fact, four blocks of 8, 22, 30, and 37 nucleotides show sequence identity of > 70% [24] . Whether the Y-ends of these genomes are capped is unknown.",

The two predicted HepCV glycoprotein ORFs are preceded by putative signal peptide sequences [-29, 50] . Other preliminary studies indicate that HepCV may possess at least three structural proteins, the 18-22 kDa basic nucleocapsid protein (C) and two glycoproteins, a hydrophobic 33 kDa protein (E 1) and a 70kDa glycoprotein (E2/NS 1) [9, 11] .

Overall, however, the amino acid sequence of HepCV-1 is only distantly related to those of the flaviviruses and pestiviruses [13, 27, 33, 44] . Because of these differences but otherwise great similarities in genome organization and viron properties, HepCV has been suggested to be classified as a new genus within the family Flaviviridae [9, 13, 44] .",

            "text": "The Y-untranslated segment is highly conserved. For example, the 329-nucleotides 5'-segment upstream of the continuous ORF of HepCV-1, -KB, and -J differ from each other by only one or two nucleotides [24, 29, 44] . Similarly, a maximum divergence of 1-5 nucleotides was observed between the 5r-untranslated segment of HepCV-1 and those of 10 other isolates from the U.S.A., Australia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Argentina, South Africa, and Taiwan [24] . The high degree of conservation of the 5'-segment suggests that it provides important regulatory functions. The 3'-terminal segment seems somewhat less conserved. Although only one nucleotide differs in the 3'-untranslated segments of HepCV-KB and -J [29, 44] , the 27 nucleotides T-segment of HepCV-1 differs from those of the Japanese isolates by at least 30% [13, 24] . Considerable sequence differences also exist between various HepCV isolates in the long ORF, but not all parts vary equally. For example, the ORFs of the two Japanese isolates HepCV-KB and -J exhibit 95.0% amino acid identity, but the amino acid identity is only 84.5 and 85.4% for the chimpanzee isolate HepCV-1 and HepCV-KB and HepCV-J, respectively. (Sequences were analyzed using the Molecular Biology Information Resource suite of programs (MBIR; Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). Multiple alignments were produced with implementation of the Klotz and Blanten method [30 a] . Protein sequences were further analyzed using \"homology\" [32 a] with the Dayhoff scoring matrix.) However, even though the overall percentage of amino acid differences between the HepCV-10RF and those of the two Japanese isolates are about the same, a considerable number of different amino acids of the latter are involved indicating a rather complex relationship between the reported genomic sequences. Amino acid differences between the three strains are particularly prevalent in a segment encompassing amino acids 240-1140, that is the segment representing E 1/E 2/NS 1, and the amino terminal portion of the adjacent downstream protein (see Fig. 1 ), which seem to contain areas with higher than average variability (see below). In this segment amino acid divergence amounts to 8.3, 20.8, and 27.2% for HepCV-KB and -J, HepCV-1 and -KB, and HepCV-1 and -J, respectively. In contrast a replicase domain of 48 amino acids is the same for HepCV-KB and -J, and that of HepCV-1 differs only by two amino acids (see Fig. 8 in [38] ). The overall nucleotide sequence homology of the coding segment is 91.5% between HepCV-KB and -J, 78.3% between HepCV-1 and -J and 77.9% between HepCV-1 and -KB.",

The putative nucleocapsid protein sequence derived from PCR products of RNA extracted from healthy Japanese carrier plasma exhibited a 97.4% amino acid identity with the sequence determined for the original chimpanzee HepCV isolate (HepCV-1) but only a 90.5 % identity at the nucleotide level [45] [46] [47] . Furthermore, only 70-75% amino acid and nucleotide identity was observed for a 351 nucleotides sequence encoding part of the putative envelope proteins (Fig. 1 ) of the two HepCV isolates [45] [46] [47] . By comparing the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of four HepCV isolates from the U.S.A. and two from Italy (amino acids 129-437), a moderately variable domain of approximately 40 amino acids in the E 1 region and a hypervariable domain (region V) of approximately 28 amino acids in the junction between E 1 and E 2/NS 1 (see Fig. 1 ) have been identified [50] . Although the overall divergence between the six isolates was only 7% for nucleotides and 6% for amino acids, the hypervariable region accounted for up to 60% of the observed amino acid differences between the isolates. The significance of the apparent variabilities in the glycoprotein coding sequences is unclear. It could be a consequence of immune selection and needs to be considered in the future development of HepCV vaccines.",

Furthermore, the HepCV R N A extracted from these patients was not detectahle by PCR using certain primers based on the sequence of HepCV-1 [281. Other c D N A clones to the non-structural region generated by PCR from RNA extracted from Japanese blood donors, however, exhibited less divergence from the prototype HepCV-1.",

Combined the results indicate that numerous variants of HepCV are present in various parts of the world and that some of these variants, such as HepCV-J, might represent subtypes of HepCV-1 [29, 50] . Further work is required to establish the prevalence of various variants in different countries. Since amino acid sequence divergence is most prevalent in the putative envelope glycoproteins and the segment equivalent to the amino terminus of p 125 of the pestiviruses and NS 2 of the flaviviruses (up to 30%), another interesting question is whether the variants become selected in the course of chronic infections due to immunological pressures.",
