By 14 days after inoculation, the brains of all antibody-protected mice examined were nearly normal on histological examination . At 3-8 weeks post-inoculation, approximately 40% of the antibody-protected mice developed a neurological disease characterized by hindlimb paralysis and wasting . Evidence of inflammation and demyelination was apparent in the spinal cord and brainstem . The mice that remained asymptomatic at this time showed few signs of inflammation and none developed clinical disease over the following 9 months. Viral antigen could be detected in most of the mice examined at all times after inoculation, whether symptomatic or not, and was particularly evident in the animals with hindlimb paralysis . MHV-JHM could be consistently cultured from the mice with hindlimb paralysis . These results show that maternal immune factors can completely protect susceptible mice from the acute, fatal, clinical encephalomyelitis caused by MHV-JHM, but cannot prevent the establishment of a latent state and subsequent development of virus-induced, clinically evident, demyelinating disease . This model will be useful for studying the virus and host factors important for the development of MHV-JHM latency and subsequent virus-induced demyelination .",

Clinical signs including hunching, ruffled fur, irritability and lethargy. Three of 12 mice developed these signs within 3 days of inoculation, whereas the remaining 9/12 did so within the following 4 days . Virus titers in the brains of infected animals at 3 and 5 days post-inoculation were approximately 4 x 10 3 and 2 x 10' PFU/g respectively (Table 1 ) , and viral antigen could be found throughout the brain parenchyma (Table 2 ), in both the grey and white matter, particularly at day 5 post-inoculation . Histological examination of the brain at 3 days post-inoculation revealed a small amount of leptomeningeal infiltration whereas at 5 days post-inoculation it showed an acute encephalitis, including perivascular, parenchymal and leptomeningeal inflammatory infiltrates, and proliferating astrocytes and microglia surrounding neurons (glial stars) . Antibody protected mice : clinical studies If female mice were immunized prior to mating, the offspring were completely protected against the acute, fatal encephalomyelitis in agreement with published results .\" In our experiments, female mice were immunized with MHV-JHM in Freund's adjuvant five times . Resulting antibody titers ranged from 1 :700 to 1 :4300 (mean 1 :2700) by plaque-reduction neutralization assay (Fig . 2) . The offspring were infected intranasally at 10 days of age with the same dose of virus (5x10' PFU) that caused the acute encephalomyelitis in the offspring of unimmunized mothers . As shown in Fig . 1 , 100% of the suckling mice survived the infection, and none developed any signs of clinical disease during the first few weeks following virus inoculation . In the period 3-8 weeks after inoculation (mean : 35 d, range 23-60 d), 40% (12/30) of the mice developed a neurological illness characterized by hindlimb paralysis . The clinical disease was variable in the rapidity with which hindlimb paresis progressed to complete paralysis . In some degeneration . Virus could be cultured from brains and spinal cords but not livers at this time (Table 1 ) . Using an immunoperoxidase assay, viral antigen was detected throughout the brain in both the grey and white matter in the cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem . No viral antigen could be detected in the spinal cord at this time ( Table  2) Day 7 : On histological examination, the brains of mice 7 days after inoculation showed evidence of meningoencephalitis (Fig . 3) , although the mice were totally asymptomatic . There were perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and widespread, focal petechiae throughout the grey and white matter . Subependymal and meningeal infiltrates were also present . The cerebrum was heavily involved, with fewer inflammatory cells present in the hippocampus . Glial stars, similar to those seen in the acutely-infected mice, were present in the cerebral cortex adjacent to injured neurons . Lymphocytic infiltrates were also apparent in the diencephalon and pons, with minimal involvement of the cerebellum . The liver showed evidence of viral infection also, with a few areas of lymphocytic infiltration in a nodular pattern apparent, although infectious virus was not present . Viral antigen could be readily detected throughout the grey and white matter of the brain by immunocytochemical analysis of frozen sections and was also observed in scattered foci in a few of the spinal cords of these mice (Table 2 ) . Virus could be cultured from the brain at seven days after inoculation in 1 of 6 mice examined (Table 1) .",

The cerebrum showed a few areas of lymphocytic infiltration, and a basilar meningeal infiltrate was apparent . The spinal cord had many areas of focal damage with lymphocytic infiltration . After staining with Luxol Fast Blue, extensive white matter destruction was apparent with many foamy histiocytes present (Fig . 5) . Many degenerating pyknotic cells were also observed in the white matter (Fig . 5 ) . Although these cells could not be definitively identified by electron microscopy, their small size and presence in white matter suggested that they were most likely oligodendrocytes . A few coronavirus-like particles were tentatively identified by electron microscopy but they were not present in large clusters, as seen in the acute infection s (data not shown) .",
