To further simplify this system for engineering purposes and to minimize its immunogenicity, we tried to truncate the SpyCatcher protein while maintaining its conjugation activity. A structural analysis found that aa 53-118 are probably essential for the conjugation activity. An immunogenicity analysis revealed four major immune epitopes at the N-terminus (aa 32-50, aa 57-66) and C-terminus (aa 104-112, aa 121-138) ( Figure S1 ). Considering these together, we performed several truncations, as shown in Figure 1a . The truncation with deletion at the N-terminus (24-47 aa) was named SpyCatcherDN, and the truncation with deletions at both the N-terminus and the C-terminus (24-47 and 121-138 aa) was named SpyCatcherDNC. The truncated SpyCatcher proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography ( Figure 1b) . The full-length and truncated SpyCatcher proteins were then used to immunize C57BL/6 mice. Fourteen days later, antibody levels in the sera were determined by ELISA. As shown in Figure 1c , the antibody levels induced by SpyCatcherDN and SpyCatcherDNC were significantly lower than those induced by full-length SpyCatcher. No significant difference was found between SpyCatcherDN and SpyCatcherDNC. Next, we further tested the efficiency of the binding of the truncated SpyCatcher proteins to the SpyTag fusion protein, aDEC205-SpyTag, which was made by genetic fusion of SpyTag with a single-chain antibody against murine DEC205 (aDEC205) at its C-terminus. As shown in Figures 1d and  1e , there was no significant difference in binding efficiency between SpyCatcherDN and full-length SpyCatcher, consistent with the results of a recent study 24 . However, the binding efficiency of SpyCatcherDNC was obviously lower than that of full-length SpyCatcher. Therefore, SpyCatcherDN was chosen for further studies.",

The discovery of effective antigens and immunomodulatory molecules is a major challenge in the field of vaccine development 3, 4 . Modern immunology and genomics provide a large amount of candidates for each. Simple, rapid and efficient experimental screening of the optimal composition of a vaccine is generally in demand, especially when facing pandemic outbreaks of infections, such as SARS-CoV in 2003 25 , H1N1 influenza in 2009 26 and MERS-CoV in 2012 27 . The traditional de novo generation of gene-based synthetic vaccines is both time consuming and costly. In our present study, based on the SpyTag/SpyCatcher technique, we have developed a novel method of vaccine construction by protein assembly based on pre-prepared vaccine components. We have employed this technique for the construction of a DC-targeting vaccine and have found it highly efficient to induce both T-and B-cell responses. Although this strategy still relies on genetic manipulation and protein production, it does not require synthesizing a large, complex fusion protein de novo every time; the strategy only produces smaller protein components as building blocks, which is easier and faster. This block-building strategy may allow people to construct various formulations of vaccines conveniently and efficiently when needed. The approach may simplify the whole process of vaccine generation and accelerate antigen screening and verification ( Figure 6 ). In addition, certain vaccine components (building blocks) may be easily reused for the construction of other vaccines.",

            "text": "Different methods have been developed to construct synthetic vaccines. The traditional way is genetic manipulation, which provides great flexibility. However, this de novo generation usually takes a long time, and it is occasionally difficult to express large molecules. Chemical conjugation offers an alternative, fast way to overcome the shortcomings mentioned above. However, the chemical conjugation process is usually not easily controlled, resulting in poor homogeneity in terms of the degree of conjugation and the number of conjugation sites. An isopeptide bond is an amide bond formed between the side-chain amine of lysine and the side-chain carboxyl group of either glutamate or aspartate. This bond has been shown to be very useful for protein-protein coupling and protein modification 28 . SpyTag/SpyCatcher was recently developed and found to be highly efficient for site-specific protein conjugation. Impelled by the limitations of current methods for vaccine construction and inspired by the concept of synthetic vaccinology, we hypothesized that this new technique might be useful for easily and precisely assembling different vaccine components at the protein level. This approach may possess several advantages: (1) In contrast to genetic manipulation, this system does not generate a whole vaccine de novo; instead, it produces different protein components and assembles them as needed. This method may thus significantly reduce the time spent and the cost, especially when many designs need to be tested. (2) In contrast to chemical conjugation-based approaches, this system allows quantitative and site-specific installation of antigens at a designated position in the antibody that does not influence the antibody-targeting ability. (3) SpyTag and SpyCatcher can efficiently react with each other to form a stable covalent bond under diverse conditions. (4) SpyTag is reactive no matter it is at the N-terminus, the C-terminus, or the internal site of a protein and therefore offers greater flexibility than other split protein-derived systems or intein/ sortase tag systems do 29, 30 . In addition, recent work by the Howarth group has optimized this system to potentially provide further advantages 31 : (1) SpyCatcher can be shortened to KTag, allowing SpyTag and KTag to form a peptide-peptide ligation. Thus, this new system could further reduce the influence of SpyCatcher's own immunogenicity, if any. (2) The SpyTag-and-KTag system allows cycles of conjugation, which enables assembly of a vaccine with multiple components, such as protein-based adjuvants and multivalent antigens. (3) The short KTag makes high-throughput screening of epitopes feasible because the short KTag-epitope fusion peptides can be easily prepared by total synthesis.",

The single chain-encoding DNA was PCR amplified using the following primers: DEC205 F, GCG CGTACGGAGG-TGAAGCTGTTGGAATC and DEC205 R, GCGTTCGAACCGTTT CAATT-CCAGCTTGG. The DNA was then cloned into the pEE12.4 expression plasmid (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) between the IgGk leading sequence and the human IgG Fc sequence using BsiWI and BstBI (bold font). The SpyTag-encoding sequence (GCTCACATCGTGATGGTGGACGCCTACAAGCCCACCAAG) and a GSGESG linker (GGATCCGGCGAGTCCGGC) were then genetically fused to the C-terminus of the human IgG Fc fragment by PCR to construct the final plasmid pEE12.4 aDEC205-SpyTag. Figure 6 | Perspective on protein assembly-based synthetic vaccine R&D. During the R&D of vaccines against cancer and infectious diseases, especially in the era of big data, many functional units (such as immune molecules) and antigens are available for screening and optimization. The conventional way (left) of making synthetic vaccines usually completely depends on de novo construction, and each combination has to be made individually, which is time consuming and costly. By taking advantage of a protein assembly-based method (right), each vaccine component can be prepared and then simply assembled into a full vaccine, as needed. This procedure could be easier, faster, more flexible and more efficient. Ag, antigen. For the in vivo assay, na\u00efve WT C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously in the tail base with 200 pmol of the aDEC205-Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 adduct, aDEC205-SpyTag or isotype-control antibody. After 20 h, inguinal DLNs were collected and digested to form a single-cell suspension. The cells were stained with an anti-FccR mAb, followed by PE-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody staining before flow cytometry analysis.",
