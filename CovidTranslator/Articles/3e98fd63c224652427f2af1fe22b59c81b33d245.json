The virus also spread through contact with contaminated equipment and materials. When people congregate in settings other than work, they will continue to spread the virus, so the benefits of workplace closure may be greatly reduced or eliminated. Of the emerging pathogens capable of infecting humans that could be called exopathogens, about 75% originated as diseases of animals [14] . Knowing that the spread of pneumonia depends on person-to-person transmission could help researchers predict and prevent the spread of the new virus. The WHO has been helping countries prepare to contain the virus as much as possible [5] .",
