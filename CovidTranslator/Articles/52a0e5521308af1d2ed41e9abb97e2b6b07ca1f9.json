Taking into account their mechanisms of action, therapeutic agents belong to different pharmacological classes. Among them, those which interact with DNA, such as DNA alkylating agents, intercalators or groove binders, are of special interest. [1] [2] [3] Intercalators constitute a well explored class of compounds because their mode of action is the most predictable and relies on inhibition of replication process by reversible binding to DNA. 4, 5 The planar aromatic fragments of intercalators insert into the DNA double helix, thereby distorting the DNA backbone conformation and poison the DNA topoisomerases I or II. 6 Several factors are responsible for stabilization a drug-DNA complex, namely stacking p-bond interactions, van der Waals forces and eventually hydrogen bonding between the aromatic fragment of a drug moiety and the purine/pyrimidine bases present in DNA strains. Intercalators can be classified according to their aromatic/heteroaromatic subunit or electrostatic potential they posses. 2,3 Among them, naphthalimide derivatives have been found promising as anticancer agents since they are able to intercalate into DNA and some of them, including amonafide 1 7, 8 and mitonafide 2, 9 have reached clinical trials for treatment of solid tumors, however most of them showed poor therapeutic indices.",

The amino group of a sugar residue in doxorubicin 3 forms an ionic bond with the phosphate function of the DNA which results in additional and very efficient stabilization of locking the drug into an active site. 10 There are also known groups of intercalators which activities are related to the specific shape of molecule rather than their aromatic ring system. Studies on intercalating properties of 2-[(arylmethyl)amino]-2-methyl-1, 3-propanodiols (AMAPs) 4 proved that the amino side chain is responsible for DNA binding due to electrostatic interactions and enhanced activity which was observed for derivatives with 2-amino-1,3-propanediol moiety (Fig. 1) . 11, 12 Compounds 5 (Fig. 2 ) have been designed as new isoxazolidinecontaining intercalators equipped with planar polycyclic aromatic frameworks at C3 and their cytotoxic and apoptotic properties have already been described. 13, 14 Recently, we succeeded in the preparation of compounds 6 having 1-and 2-naphthyl substituents at C5 of an isoxazolidine ring and they proved cytotoxic against HeLa and K562 cell lines with IC 50 values 50 and 90 lM, respectively. 15 Moreover, isoxazolidines 7 containing at C5 a carbamoyl linker which separates the isoxazolidine ring and substituted phenyls suppressed divisions of three cancer cell lines at concentrations ranging from 228 to 102 lM. 16 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2015.04.079 0968-0896/\u00d3 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For the purpose of this study, N-substituted acrylamides 11 were synthesized starting from commercially available naphthalic anhydride 13 via multistep procedures including nitration 27 followed by a standard reduction of the nitro group, 28 transformation of the aminoanhydride 15 into naphthalimides 16a-f by treatment with alkyl amines or ethylenediamines 29 and finally preparation of acrylamides 11a-f from 16a-f and acryloyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine (Scheme 2). The series of dipolarophiles 12a-c were obtained in the reaction of naphthalic anhydrides 13, 14 and 15 with allylamine. 29 Furthermore, naphthalimide 12c was converted into its acetyl derivative 12d. 30 1,3-Dipolar cycloadditions of a nitrone 8 31 with naphthalimides 11a-f were performed in toluene or a toluene-chloroform mixture at 70\u00b0C and led to the formation of diastereoisomeric mixtures of (3-diethoxyphosphoryl)isoxazolidines trans-9a-f and cis-9a-f (Scheme 3; Table 1 ). In all cases moderate trans/cis diastereoselectivities were observed with trans-isomers 9a-f predominating (de 56-72%). Purification of the crude mixtures of cycloadducts on silica gel columns resulted in separation of all major diastereoisomers trans-9a-f as well as all minor isomers cis-9a-f.",

Crude mixtures of cycloadducts were subjected to purification on silica gel columns and subsequent crystallization. However, attempts at separating diastereoisomers trans-10a-d and cis-10a-d failed leading to mixtures enriched in isomers trans-10 (Scheme 4; Table 2 ). The relative configurations of the isoxazolidines trans-9a-f and cis-9a-f were determined taking advantage of our previous studies on stereochemistry of cycloaddition of N-methyl-C-diethoxyphosphorylnitrone 8 with (hetero)arylacrylamides 16 since similar 1 H NMR spectral patterns for the respective series of isoxazolidines trans-9a-f and cis-9a-f were observed as compared to the previously described trans-and cis-5-(hetero)arylcarbamoyl-2methylisoxazolidin-3-yl-3-phosphonates. 16, 32 Briefly, for the major trans-isomers 9a-f the 3 E conformation (Fig. 3 ) of an isoxazolidine ring was established taking advantage of the diagnostic values of vicinal coupling constants [J CCCP = 7.7-8. 9 Hz, J H3-H4a = 8.1-8. 3 Hz, J H3-H4b = 8.5-8. 9 Hz, J H4a-P = 9.4-10. 3 Hz, J H4b-P = 15.7-16.1 Hz, J H4a-H5 = 5.5-5. 8 Hz and J H4b-H5 = 8.7-8. 9 Hz] extracted from the respective 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra. In this conformation the diethoxyphosphoryl group resides in the equatorial position of the isoxazolidine ring while carbamoyl substituents are located pseudoequatorially. Similarly, relative configurations of isoxazolidines trans-10a-d and cis-10a-d were established based on very close stereochemical outcomes found for the reaction between a nitrone 8 and N-allylated naphthalimides 12a-d as compared with already elaborated analogous reactions of a nitrone 8 and N-allylated nucleobases. 33 ",

Among isoxazolidines having a carbamoyl linker, structure-activity relationship studies indicated that the presence of a tertiary nitrogen atom in a side chain significantly increased cytostatic activity of the tested compounds. Phosphonates trans-9a-c and cis-9a-c having straight aliphatic chains were considerably less cytostatic (IC 50 = 20-85 lM) than those containing tertiary amino functions, namely trans-9d-f and cis-9d-f.

Furthermore, both trans-and cis-isoxazolidines 9d, 9e and 9f having aminoalkyl substituents appeared to be the most cytostatic towards L1210, CEM and HeLa cell lines with IC 50 's below 23 lM.

Besides their high cytostatic activity, compounds trans-9d, cis-9d, trans-9f and cis-9f were found to reduce viability of MDCK and CrFK cells at concentrations in the range of 95.2-62.2 lM (CC 50 ). In addition, phosphonates trans-9a, trans-9b, cis-9b, cis-9c, trans-9e and cis-9e exhibited high cytostatic activity against human lymphocyte cells (CEM), comparable to that of 5-fluorouracil, while trans-9d and trans-9f were even five-fold more active than 5-fluorouracil.
