It is the infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and it is a kind of atypical pneumonia. On 1 December 2019, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the city of Wuhan, Hebei province, China and the virus that started the pneumonia outbreak spreads in the country. The major source of infection is the patients with COVID-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers seem also a potential source of infection. It is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets, contact, digestive tract and aerosol transmission. This disease is characterized as highly contagious and is susceptible to humans of all ages. On 8 January, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Thailand, which is the earliest confirmed case outside China [1] . On 20 January, the first confirmed case was identified in the Republic of Korea [2] . Since then, a number of cases were confirmed in Singapore, Italy, Iran, the United States, Russia, etc. Thus far, this disease has spreaded globally.",

On the second day after the end of investigation, Dr. Bruce Aylward, the head of the international expert panel of the WHO-China Joint Mission, the senior adviser to the WHO's Director-General, stated at the press briefing at WHO Headquarters in Geneva, that faced with the unknown pathogen, China has taken ambitious, flexible and aggressive efforts in responding to the epidemic. In the report, WHO-China Joint Mission has confirmed that China has played a crucial role in protecting the international society, buying precious time for countries to adopt active prevention and control measures and providing them with worthwhile experiences. The report also points out specifically the high effective role of non-pharmaceutic measures [5] . The report said that China, as the country with the greatest knowledge on COVID-19, should further enhance the systematic and real-time sharing of epidemiologic data, clinical results and experience to inform the global response. With regard to \"non-pharmaceutic measures\" proposed in the report of WHO-China Joint Mission, besides active surveillance, timely detection, voluntary quarantine and rigorous tracing, actually, there is still a mysterious power, that is various kinds of external therapeutic approaches of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). By the time for the authors submitting the manuscript, it is known that many therapeutic methods of TCM, e.g. Chinese herbal decoction, acupuncture, moxibusiton, acupoint plaster, auricular acupuncture and cupping have adopted in the treatment of COVID-19. In the regions where TCM therapeutic methods were highly utilized, the curative rate was increased, the number of severe case decreased and the hospital discharge rate improved remarkably [6] . The utilization of TCM therapeutic interventions block effectively the continuous spreading of COVID-19 in China.",

But, in reference to the records of ancient medical works and the nowadays popular method of moxibustion in the folk, moxa smoke is applicable for the prevention of infectious diseases. For example, it is recorded in Zh \u020fuh\u00f2u B\u00e8ij\u00edf \u0101ng ( Emergency Formulas to Keep Up One's Sleeve ), written by Hong GE, in the Jin Dynasty(317 \u2212420AD) that smoking with moxa around the patient's bed, one moxa cone on each side of the bed is optimal to prevent from epidemic infection. The medical masters in the later generations had inherited this idea. The same prevention method is also recorded in T\u00e0ip\u00edng Sh\u00e8nghu\u00ecf \u0101ng ( Formulas from Benevolent Sages Compiled during the Taiping Era ) and P \u0217j\u00ecf \u0101ng ( Formulas for Universal Relief ). This moxibustion intervention is the earliest-recorded measure of air disinfection in history. The modern research discovers that moxa smoke acts on antibacteria, anti-fungus, anti-virus and anti-pathogen [8] . Therefore, on the base of individual tolerance, the appropriate use of moxa smoke in room brings a certain effect of disinfection. In Guidance , the duration of moxibustion at each acupoint is 10 to 15 min. But, in clinical practice, the moxibustion is seldom exerted on acupoints one by one. Instead, the special device, moxa box or moxa holder is used to cover several acupoints simultaneously in one moxibustion intervention. The duration of treatment is over 30 min generally and it will be even longer if the heat-sensitive moxibustion is exerted. Therefore, the authors believe that the duration of moxibustion intervention should be longer to achieve a better effect if the patient is in a comfortable posture and has strong endurance.",

With the development of COVID-19, the people are getting deep understanding of the disease and more and more experiences in treatment will be accumulated gradually. It also reflects that the nature of medical development is the process of constant understanding, rectification and conquering disease. At present, COVID-19 is spreading in many countries of the world. China's experiences in fight against COVID-19 have been recognized and advocated by WHO. Of them, the application of Chinese herbal medication, acupuncture and moxibustion have their unique characteristics. Undoubtedly, the modern medicine measures give priority to treatment and salvage of COVID-19. But, no matter which medical theoretic system is adopted, faced with the epidemic, every measure should aim to treating disease and saving lives. More weapons available in the fight against the disease do bring more benefits to patients.",
