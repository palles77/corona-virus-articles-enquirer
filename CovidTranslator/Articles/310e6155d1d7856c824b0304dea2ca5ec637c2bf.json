The commensal bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus has been suggested to exert beneficial effects as a supplement during H. pylori eradication therapy. In the present study, we applied whole-genome microarray analysis to compare the immune responses induced in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) stimulated with L. acidophilus, H. pylori, or both bacteria in combination. While L. acidophilus induced a Th1-polarizing response characterized by high expression of interferon beta (IFN-\u2424) and interleukin 12 (IL-12), H. pylori strongly induced the innate cytokines IL-1\u2424 and IL-1\u2423.

Confocal microscopy demonstrated that the addition of H. pylori to L. acidophilus-stimulated BMDMs redirects intracellular processing, leading to an accumulation of L. acidophilus in the endosomal and lysosomal compartments. Thus, our findings indicate that H. pylori inhibits the development of a strong Th1-polarizing response in BMDMs stimulated with L. acidophilus by blocking the production of IFN-\u2424 in a VacA-dependent manner. We suggest that this abrogation is caused by a redirection of the endocytotic pathway in the processing of L. acidophilus.",

In particular, how H. pylori avoids killing by macrophages, one of the main types of immune cell underlying the epithelium, remains elusive.

Our results identify potential targets for the treatment of H. pylori infection and vaccination, since specific inhibition of the toxin VacA possibly allows the activation of an efficient immune response and thereby eradication of H. pylori in the host.

We have previously shown that the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is a strong inducer of the Th1-polarizing cytokines interferon beta (IFN-\u2424) and interleukin 12 (IL-12) in dendritic cells (18) (19) (20) . In this study, we investigated whether L. acidophilus is able to modulate the inflammatory response in-duced by H. pylori in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). We utilized whole-genome microarray analysis to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in uptake and processing of the bacteria in addition to the immune response generated. BMDMs were stimulated with either L. acidophilus or H. pylori or with both bacteria in combination. Contrary to our expectations, our results demonstrate that H. pylori is able to block the induction of IFN-\u2424 and IL-12 by L. acidophilus. Furthermore, Rgs1/2, Fgd2, and Dock8, key regulators of the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 GTPases, respectively, required for the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, were strongly suppressed when H. pylori was added to BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus. This inhibition was independent of the viability of H. pylori or the virulence factor CagPAI but completely dependent on the VacA toxin. Confocal microscopy revealed that the addition of H. pylori to L. acidophilus-treated BMDMs induces alterations in the endocytic pathway that prevent intracellular processing of L. acidophilus and thereby the induction of IFN-\u2424.

Since we wanted to ensure that L. acidophilus is able to interact with the macrophages prior to their encounter with the motile pathogen H. pylori, we added H. pylori 251 to BMDMs after 1 h of prestimulation with L. acidophilus NCFM (cell-bacterium ratio, 1:1). After 5 h, the BMDMs were harvested and genome-wide microarray analysis was performed. In total, 4,181 upregulated and 3,956 downregulated genes were common in the three groups of stimulatory conditions (Fig. 1A) . In the L. acidophilus-stimulated group, 153 genes were exclusively upregulated and 109 genes exclusively downregulated. Upon stimulation with H. pylori alone, 61 genes were exclusively upregulated and 70 genes exclusively downregulated.

In contrast, H. pylori induced primarily an innate immune response upregulating the cytokines IL-1\u2424 (Il1b) and IL-1\u2423 (Il1a) and the neutrophil-recruiting chemokines (Cxcl3, Cxcl1, and Cxcl2) (see Table S2 ).

Figure 1B displays the downregulated genes (blue color) and upregulated genes (red color) induced by L. acidophilus, H. pylori, or both strains in combination compared to L. acidophilus alone (P \u03fd 0.01; fold change of greater than \u03ee2). Blue designates genes expressed at a lower level than with L. acidophilus alone, while red indicates greater expression. Table 1 and Fig. 1B present genes that were either strongly induced or suppressed upon the addition of both L. acidophilus and H. pylori to BMDMs relative to results with L. acidophilus alone. Only two genes were strongly induced: P2rx2 (purinergic receptor P2X, ligand-gated ion channel 2) and Pdxp (pyridoxal [pyridoxine, vitamin B6] phosphatase), both regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, were upregulated 7.7-fold and 3.9-fold, respectively. P2rx2 belongs to the family of ligand-gated ion channels that open in response to ATP (23) . Activation of P2X receptors induces actin cytoskeleton alterations via Rho activation in macrophages (24, 25) . Pdxp is located in the cytosol, colocalizes with the actin cytoskeleton, and acts as a positive regulator of actin filament depolymerization (26) . In total, 12 genes were strongly suppressed ( Table 1 ). The gene encoding IFN-\u2424 (Ifnb) was the most significantly inhibited (18.5-fold) over 41,000 genes and transcripts analyzed. Interleukin 12b (encoded by Il12b) was likewise significantly suppressed (4.3-fold). Other strongly suppressed genes identified were Rgs2 and Rgs1 (regulator of G-protein signalling 2 and 1) (27) , Dock8 (dedicator of cytokinesis 8) (28) , and Fgd2 (FYVE, RhoGEF, and PH domain-containing 2) (29), all involved in signaling of Rho, Rac, or Cdc42 GTPase, which are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton (P \u03fd 0.01) (30) .",

Entry of the H. pylori VacA toxin into epithelial cells is dependent on pinocytosis and controlled by the Cdc42 GTPase (31) . Furthermore, in epithelial cells, VacA utilizes the Rac1 GTPase to induce cell vacuolation in host cells (32) . We therefore speculated that the H. pylori VacA toxin may also play a role in macrophages and may be implicated in the inhibition of Ifn-\u2424 (Fig. 3C ). Our hypothesis was confirmed, since an isogenic H. pylori 251 vacA mutant, in contrast to the wild-type strain, was unable to block Ifn-\u2424 when added to BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus (P \u03fd 0.01). To recapitulate that VacA is essential for the immunosuppression of L. acidophilus-induced IFN-\u2424, we added bacterialfree supernatants (SN) from wild-type H. pylori 251 in various dilutions to BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus (see Fig. S3A in the supplemental material). Our finding was confirmed, since the VacA-containing supernatant from wild-type H. pylori 251 strongly inhibited the IFN-\u2424 response induced by L. acidophilus. In contrast, bacterial-free supernatant from the H. pylori 251 vacA mutant was not capable of suppressing IFN-\u2424 produced by L. acidophilus-stimulated macrophages (see Fig. S3B ).",

Since our previous experiment revealed that phagosomal processing of L. acidophilus is required to trigger the release of IFN-\u2424 in macrophages, we hypothesized that H. pylori redirects the intracellular processing and degradation of L. acidophilus. To determine the intracellular location of H. pylori and L. acidophilus, we applied deconvolution microscopy and analyzed the uptake of the bacteria with the early endosome marker EEA1 (34) and the late endosome and lysosome marker LAMP-1 (35) . Since we have shown that H. pylori is able to block the induction of Ifn-\u2424 at a very early stage (Fig. 2B) , we added L. acidophilus NCFM to BMDMs and analyzed the localization of the bacterium after 2 h. As can be observed in Fig. 4A , a large proportion of intracellular L. acidophilus bacteria did not colocalize with either EEA1 or LAMP-1 compartments. Indeed, we determined that after 2 h of incubation, approximately only 7% and 30% of intracellular L. acidophilus NCFM were contained within endosomal and lysosomal compartments, respectively (Fig. 4C) . The remainder of bacteria were not associated with either marker (*, P \u03fd 0.05; **, P \u03fd 0.01). In contrast, we detected the formation of megasomes and a significant increase in L. acidophilus colocalized in the endosomal and lysosomal compartments (19% and 50%, respectively, after 2 h incubation) when H. pylori was added, compared to results for BMDMs that were stimulated with L. acidophilus alone ( Fig. 4B and C). Figure 4D presents a magnified image of L. acidophilus localized in lysosomes (white arrow) in either the presence or absence of H. pylori. Our results indicate a greater release of L. acidophilus from the phagocytic compartments in the absence of H. pylori. We suggest that the addition of H. pylori leads to an accumulation of L. acidophilus in the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, thereby preventing the induction of IFN-\u2424 by L. acidophilus.",

Whole-genome microarray analysis revealed that while L. acidophilus induces T-cell recruiting chemokines (Cxcl10 and Cxcl11), proinflammatory (IL-1\u2424 and IL-6), and Th1-skewing cytokines (IFN-\u2424 and IL-12), H. pylori predominantly induced cytokines indicative of innate immune responses (IL-1\u2424 and IL-1\u2423) and neutrophil-recruiting chemokines (Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl3). Most importantly, microarray analysis revealed that when H. pylori is added to BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus, Th1-skewing cytokines induced by L. acidophilus are strongly inhibited. Real-time PCR confirmed that H. pylori blocks the gene expression of IFN-\u2424, IL-12, Cxcl10, and TNF-\u2423, while it has an additive effect on the cytokine IL-1\u2424. Thus, our results show that H. pylori prevents the production of factors induced by L. acidophilus in macrophages that contribute to initiating the adaptive immune response.",

In contrast, the genes Rgs1/2, Fgd2, and Dock8, regulators of the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 GTPases, which are molecular switches controlling the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, were strongly suppressed. It is well established that many bacterial pathogens regulate host trafficking pathways by the selective inclusion or retention of GTPases in host cells during infection and use these important cellular regulators as part of their overall virulence strategy (36, 37) .

The Grampositive lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (Danisco, Copenhagen, Denmark) was grown anaerobically overnight at 37\u00b0C in de Man Rogosa Sharp (MRS) broth (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The Gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori was grown on solid agar and liquid broth as previously described (45) . The following strains and mutants were used: the clinical isolate Helicobacter pylori 251 (46) and the Helicobacter pylori 251 CagPAI deletion mutant (45) . The Helicobacter pylori 251 VacA (HP0887) mutant was constructed in this study by natural transformation using the plasmid pCTB8::Km (47), a kind gift from Tim Cover (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Confirmation of allelic exchange of VacA with vacA::Km in the 251 vacA mutant was performed by PCR. Heat killing of H. pylori was performed by incubating H. pylori at 60\u00b0C for 20 min and confirming the bacteria were no longer viable by testing their growth on solid horse blood agar as previously described (45) .Generation of murine macrophages from bone marrow progenitor cells. C57BL/6 mice were bred and housed under specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions within the animal facility of Monash Medical Centre. Mice were free of all Helicobacter species. All animal experiments were approved by and performed in accordance with the Monash Medical Centre Animal Ethics Committee. Female mice were used in these studies because they have been reported to be more susceptible to Helicobacterinduced pathology than male mice (48) .For the generation of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), bone marrow from female 6-to 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice was flushed out from the femur and tibia and washed in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). The cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Life Technologies, Singapore) containing 10% (vol/vol) heatinactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (Thermo Electron, VIC, Australia) supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco), 1% GlutaMAX (Gibco), and 20% of growth supernatant of L929 cells. The cells were seeded at a concentration of 7 \u03eb 10 6 cells in 10-cm 2 nontreated cell culture plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) in 10 ml of conditioned medium and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 . On day 4, 10 ml of complete medium containing 20% L929 cell-conditioned medium was added. On day 6, cells were harvested in conditioned medium, and 1 \u03eb 10 6 cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). The next day, the medium was removed, and 400 l of fresh RPMI 1640 medium (without antibiotics and FCS) was added.Stimulation of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages with bacteria or bacterial-free supernatants. Overnight cultures of L. acidophilus and H. pylori were harvested by centrifugation at 1,250 \u03eb g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and washed twice in sterile PBS. Bacteria were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (without FCS and antibiotics) and added (100 l/ well) to the BMDMs at an MOI of 1:1 (or medium, for a final volume of 500 l/well). Bacterial-free supernatants (SN) from H. pylori 251 and the H. pylori 251 vacA mutant were prepared as previously reported (49) . In brief, H. pylori grown for 24 h on agar plates was collected in 1 ml of sterile distilled water, vortexed for 30 s, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Bacteria were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was filter sterilized using a 0.2\u03eam filter. The VacA toxin contained within the water extracts was activated using hydrochloric acid, and the pH of the supernatant was subsequently neutralized prior to addition to BMDMs as previously described (50) . Supernatants were added to BMDMs at various dilutions to a final volume of 500 l/well. The cell cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 . In the inhibitor experiments, BMDMs were preincubated for 30 min with the endosomal acidification blockers chloroquine (final concentration, 20 M) and bafilomycin A1 (final concentration, 25 M) prior to stimulation with L. acidophilus. Both inhibitors were purchased from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA).Microarray analysis. Immature murine BMDMs from three female 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice were incubated with L. acidophilus NCFM, H. pylori 251, or H. pylori 251 added to BMDMs prestimulated with L. ac-idophilus NCFM for 1 h. The BMDMs were harvested 5 h after addition of H. pylori, and RNA was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy minicolumn with on-column DNase digestion. For each sample, 200 ng of RNA was Cy3 labeled with a one-color low-RNA-input quick amplification kit (Agilent). The resulting cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to Agilent whole-mouse-genome expression microarrays (G4122F), and the slides were washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Slides were scanned immediately after washing using an Agilent DNA microarray scanner (G2505B). Feature extraction was performed with Agilent Feature Extraction 9.5 software using default parameters excluding nonuniform flagged outliers. Percentile normalization and differential gene expression analysis were performed using the program GeneSpring GX 11 (Agilent Technologies).RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Murine BMDMs were harvested and homogenized by using a QIAshredder instrument (Qiagen, Australia), and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA concentration was determined with a NanoDrop instrument (Thermo, Wilmington), and 500 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed with the TaqMan reverse transcription reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using random hexamer primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. The obtained cDNA was stored in aliquots at \u03ea80\u00b0C. The following 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled TaqMan gene expression assays were purchased (Applied Biosystems): Cxcl10 (assay identifier [ID] Mm99999072_m1), IFN-\u2424 (assay ID Mm00439546_s1), IL-12b (p40) (assay ID Mm00434174_m1), TNF-\u2423 (assay ID Mm00443258_m1), IL-1\u2424 (assay, ID Mm00434228_m1), and 18S (assay, ID 4319413E). The amplifications were prepared in a total volume of 10 l containing 1\u03eb TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and diluted cDNA. All PCR reactions were carried out in triplicate in MicroAmp optical 384-well reaction plates (Applied Biosystems). The cycling parameters were initiated by 2 min at 50\u00b0C and 10 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C, and 60\u00b0C for 1 min using the 7900HT fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The amplifications were normalized to the expression of 18S. Relative transcript levels were calculated, applying the 2 \u03ea\u232c\u232cCT method.Cytokine quantification by ELISA. Protein production of IFN-\u2424 was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the cell culture supernatants using rat anti-mouse IFN-\u2424 antibody (7F-D3; Abcam, USA) followed by rabbit anti-mouse IFN-\u2424 antibody (PBL Biomedicals, USA) for detection. Recombinant IFN-\u2424 was used as a standard (made in-house). IL-12p40 (OptEIA kit; BD, USA) was analyzed in the cell culture supernatants as per the manufacturer's instructions.Microscopy. Immature murine BMDMs were seeded at a density 2 \u03eb 10 5 cells on 12-mm coverslips (Menzelglass, Germany) in 24-well tissue culture plates (Nunc) in a total volume of 500 l. LAMP-1 yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (concentration, 100 ng/1 \u03eb 10 5 cells; Rohan Teasdale, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland) was transfected into half of the wells containing BMDMs using the jetPEI macrophage in vitro DNA transfection kit (Polyplus Transfection SA, France), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The next day, medium was removed, and 200 l of fresh RPMI 1640 medium (without antibiotics and FCS) was added. L. acidophilus NCFM was labeled red with the dye Dil (Vybrant cell-labeling solutions; Molecular Probes, Life Technologies, USA), and H. pylori 251 was labeled green with the dye DiO (Vybrant cell-labeling solutions) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The bacteria (or medium) were added (100 l/well) to the BMDMs at an MOI of 1:1 (total volume, 400 l). To determine the uptake of the bacteria in the early endosomes, Dil-labeled L. acidophilus NCFM and DiO-labeled H. pylori 251 were added to the BMDMs. The medium was removed, the cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 20% Formalin for 20 min, and stored at 4\u00b0C in PBS. For antibody labeling, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)-PBS for 30 min, and labeled with the early endosome marker EEA1 antibody (Abcam, United States).
