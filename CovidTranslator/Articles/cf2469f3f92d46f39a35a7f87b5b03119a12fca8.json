The introduction of a fluorine at the 6\u2032position enhanced the inhibition of SAH hydrolase and the activity against RNA viruses. The adenosine and N 6 -methyladenosine analogues 2a\u2212e showed potent inhibition against SAH hydrolase, while only the adenosine derivatives 2a\u2212c exhibited potent antiviral activity against all tested RNA viruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, chikungunya virus, and/or Zika virus. 6\u2032,6\u2032-Difluoroaristeromycin (2c) showed the strongest antiviral effect for MERS-CoV, with a \u223c2.5 log reduction in infectious progeny titer in viral load reduction assay. The phosphoramidate prodrug 3a also demonstrated potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity, possibly by inhibiting the viral RdRp. This study shows that 6\u2032-fluorinated aristeromycins can serve as starting points for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents that target RNA viruses.",

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause serious respiratory diseases 6 that can be fatal in approximately 10 and 35% of cases, respectively. CHIKV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes a painful arthritis that can persist for months. 7 ZIKV is also transmitted by mosquitoes, 8 although sexual transmission 8 occurs as well. This virus usually causes mild disease, but can cause neurological complications in adults and fetal death or severe complications, including microcephaly in infants when women are infected during pregnancy. 9 CHIKV and ZIKV have caused massive outbreaks, totaling millions of infections over the past decade. Currently, there are no effective chemotherapeutic agents or vaccines that can prevent or cure infections of any of these four serious pathogens.",

After infection, the genomes of these viruses are translated into polyproteins that are subsequently cleaved into individual proteins by viral and/or host proteases. The nonstructural proteins (nsps) of these viruses harbor a variety of enzymatic activities that are required for the replication of the viral RNA and invariably include a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 10 an enzyme which is not present in uninfected cells.

            "text": "Many +RNA viruses (including coronaviruses, CHIKV, and ZIKV) also encode methyltransferases (MTases) 11 that are required for methylations of viral mRNA cap structures. 12 Because this capping is crucial for stability and translation of the viral RNA, and evasion of the host innate immune response, the viral MTases are considered promising targets for the development of antiviral therapy. 12 Inhibition of MTases can be indirectly achieved by the inhibition of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase. 13 The SAH hydrolase catalyzes the interconversion of SAH into adenosine and L-homocysteine. Inhibition of this enzyme leads to the accumulation of SAH in the cell, which in turn inhibits S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)dependent transmethylase reactions by feedback inhibition. 13, 14 Most of the viral MTases are dependent on SAM as the only methyl donor. Compounds that target cellular proteins might exhibit a broader spectrum of activity, are less likely to lead to drug-resistance, but have a higher likelihood of toxicity. Compounds that are specifically aimed at viral proteins are expected to be less cytotoxic, but might have a narrower spectrum of antiviral activity and might have a lower barrier antiviral drug-resistance 14 Thus, the approach of targeting cellular proteins such as SAH hydrolase can be considered as a promising strategy for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents. 14 A number of compounds have been reported to act as SAH hydrolase inhibitors. 14 Type I inhibitors act through inactivation of the NAD + cofactor, and their inhibitory effect on the catalytic activity of the enzyme can be reversed by the addition of excess NAD + . 14 Type II inhibitors are irreversible inhibitors of the SAH hydrolase that form covalent bonds with amino acid residues in the active site of the enzyme. This irreversible inhibition cannot be reversed by the addition of NAD + or adenosine or by dialysis. 14 Because both the viral RdRp and host SAH hydrolase are critical for virus replication, we aimed to design broad-spectrum nucleoside analogue inhibitors that could directly target RdRp activity and/or indirectly inhibit the methylation of viral RNA through their effect on the host SAH hydrolase. Modified nucleosides are usually taken up by the cell via nucleoside transporters and can be successively converted into mono-, di-, and triphosphates by cellular kinases. 15 Then, these modified nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) can compete with natural NTPs during RNA synthesis or can be incorporated into the nascent viral RNA, leading to chain termination or detrimental mutations. 15 (\u2212)-Aristeromycin (1) is a naturally occurring carbocyclic nucleoside that was originally identified as a metabolite of Streptomyces citricolor in 1967. 16a The first synthesis of 1 as racemate was reported by Clayton and his co-worker, 16b\u2212d and its asymmetric syntheses have since been reported. 16e\u2212h It is a type I SAH hydrolase inhibitor and exhibits potent antiviral activity against many viruses. 14a However, it could not be further advanced into clinical development because of its cytotoxicity. 17 Compound 1 was found to be toxic at low concentrations in both adenosine kinase-positive (AK + ) and AK \u2212 cells. AK + cells were presumably killed by the 5\u2032-phosphorylated form of 1, while the toxicity in AK \u2212 cells was caused by 1 itself. 17 However, this compound is also metabolized into a triphosphate form and has been observed to exert a variety of metabolic effects. 17 We aimed to use 1 as a prototype for the design of dual-target compounds intended at directly inhibiting the viral RdRp and indirectly inhibiting the capping process through targeting of cellular SAH hydrolase.",

Prisbe and his co-workers 18a have reported the synthesis of (\u00b1)-6\u2032-\u03b1-and (\u00b1)-6\u2032-\u03b2-fluorinated aristeromycins and their inhibitory activity on SAH hydrolase, but the synthesis and biological activity of (\u00b1)-6\u2032,6\u2032difluoroaristeromycin was not reported, despite the fact that the structure was claimed in the patent. 18b Thus, we set out to synthesize the 6\u2032-fluorinated-aristeromycin analogues 2 in the optically pure D-forms because biological activity can generally be attributed to one enantiomer, the D-isomer. Yin and coworkers 18c reported the elegant synthesis of optically pure (\u2212)-6\u2032-\u03b2-fluoro-aristeromycin, but its biological activity was not reported. Their synthetic route involved the 6-\u03b2-fluoroazide as the key intermediate, which was synthesized by employing S N 2 fluorination of the 6-\u03b1-triflic azide with tris(dimethylamino)sulfur(trimethylsilyl)difluoride, whereas our current approach 19 included the stereoselective electrophilic fluorination of silyl enol ether with Selectfluor as the fluorine source. In addition to the adenosine analogues, aimed at inhibiting SAH hydrolase and/or RdRp, we have also synthesized 6\u2032-fluorinated purine and pyrimidine nucleosides (changes in B of the structures in Figure 1 ), which could interfere with viral RNA synthesis by targeting the viral RdRp after their phosphorylation by cellular kinases. 15 To bypass the first and rate-limiting 5\u2032-monophosphorylation step, we have also synthesized a phosphoramidate prodrug 3 of nucleoside 2, using the McGuigan ProTides. 20 Herein, we report the synthesis of the 6\u2032-fluoroaristeromycin analogues 2 and 3 and a preliminary characterization of their effect on several +RNA viruses, which provided insight into structure\u2212activity relationships (SARs).",

All compounds 1, 2a\u2212j, and 3a\u2212c were assayed for their ability to inhibit recombinant human SAH hydrolase protein, expressed in Escherichia coli JM109, using a 5,5\u2032-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoate (DTNB) coupled assay as described by Lozada-Rami\u0301rez et al. 30 As expected, all adenosine derivatives 2a\u2212e potently inhibited SAH hydrolase, but none of the pyrimidine analogues 2f\u2212j showed any inhibitory activity at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM. None of the prodrugs 3a\u2212c exhibited inhibitory activity at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM. This result is not surprising because adenosine is the substrate for SAH hydrolase. Among the adenosine analogues, 6\u2032-\u03b2-fluoroaristeromycin (2a) exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 0.37 \u03bcM), which was 3.6-fold more potent than the control 1 (IC 50 = 1.32 \u03bcM). However, 6\u2032-\u03b1-fluoroaristeromycin (2b, IC 50 = 9.70 \u03bcM) was 26-fold less potent than the corresponding 6\u2032-\u03b2-fluoro analogue 2a and 7.4-fold less active than the 6\u2032-unsubstituted compound 1. This indicates that the stereochemistry at the 6\u2032-position is important for inhibitory activity. Interestingly, the introduction of two fluorines at the 6\u2032-position resulted in 2c (IC 50 = 1.06 \u03bcM), which was slightly more potent than the control 1. The inhibitory activity of the 6\u2032-fluoro-aristeromycin series can be ranked in the following order: 6\u2032-\u03b2-F > 6\u2032,6\u2032-F,F > 6\u2032-H > 6\u2032-\u03b1-F. The introduction of a methyl group at the N 6 -amino group of 2a, resulting in 2d, decreased the inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 4.39 \u03bcM) by 11.9-fold, while the addition of a methyl group to the N 6 -amino group of 2c, resulting in 2e, increased the inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 0.76 \u03bcM) by 1.7-fold. These results demonstrate that the N 6 -methyladenine and the adenine moieties do not lead to a decrease in inhibitory activity. Antiviral Activity.

In addition, it also inhibited ZIKV replication with an EC 50 of 0.26 \u03bcM (SI > 10) and was active against CHIKV with an EC 50 of 0.13 \u03bcM. Compound 2b showed some inhibitory effects on CHIKV and ZIKV replication, but this was likely due to pleiotropic cytotoxic effects, as the SI was <3. Among the phosphoramidate prodrugs 3a\u2212c, only the adenosine prodrug 3a exhibited significant broad-spectrum antiviral activities, demonstrating that it may inhibit the RdRp of RNA viruses after conversion into the triphosphate form, although it remains to be determined in biochemical assays whether the triphosphate form affects RdRp activity. 20 Compound 3a had an EC 50 of 9.3 \u03bcM for MERS-CoV and 6.8 \u03bcM for SARS-CoV, but it also had an SI < 10, and it was therefore not considered a potent inhibitor of coronavirus replication. However, for CHIKV and ZIKV, 3a had EC 50 values of 1.95 and 1.75 \u03bcM, respectively, with good selectivity indices. Interestingly, the prodrug 3a was less potent, but also much less cytotoxic than the parent compound 2c, which is unusual as regularly the phosphoramidate is more potent than the parent drug. 20 The phosphoramidate 3a might be slowly hydrolyzed to the 5\u2032-monophosphate by metabolic enzymes, or to the parent drug 2c by a phosphatase, which could inhibit SAH hydrolase, explaining the observed antiviral effect. Viral load reduction assays were performed with compound 2c by infecting cells with CHIKV, ZIKV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, followed by treatment with different concentrations of 2c. At 30 hpi (CHIKV) or 48 hpi (ZIKV, SARS-and MERS-CoV), infectious progeny titers in the medium were determined by plaque assay ( Figure 2 ). Treatment with concentrations higher than 1 \u03bcM of 2c reduced infectious CHIKV titers by more than 2 log. The effect on ZIKV infectious progeny titers was limited and showed a \u223c1 log reduction. For SARS-CoV, the reduction in infectious progeny titer was \u223c1.5 log at 2c concentrations above 0.3 \u03bcM. The strongest antiviral effect was observed for MERS-CoV, with a \u223c2.5 log reduction in infectious progeny titers when infected cells were treated with 2c concentrations above 0.3 \u03bcM. Followup studies to gain more insights into the mode of action of 2c and 3a and related compounds are currently ongoing, and results will be published elsewhere.",

The electrophilic fluorination of silyl enol ether with Selectfluor was the key step in the synthesis. We have also synthesized the phosphoramidate prodrugs 3a\u2212c to determine whether these would inhibit virus replication through an effect on the viral RNA polymerase.

It was discovered that the introduction of fluorine at the 6\u2032-position increases the inhibitory activity on SAH hydrolase and the replication of selected +RNA viruses. Compared to the 6\u2032-unsubstituted compound 1, the 6\u2032-fluorinated aristeromycin analogues 2a and 2c more potently inhibited SAH hydrolase activity and the replication of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, ZIKV, and CHIKV.

There was a correlation between the inhibition of SAH hydrolase and the antiviral activity of the compounds, suggesting that the latter was mainly due to indirect targeting of viral methylation reactions. The SAR studies and a lack of antiviral effects of several purine and pyrimidine analogues suggest that the antiviral effect of 1, 2a, and 2c is unlikely due to targeting of the viral RdRp. Compound 2c appears to be an interesting compound for further development and evaluation as a broadspectrum antiviral agent, as it inhibited several coronaviruses, CHIKV, and ZIKV. More detailed biological studies on the efficacy of these compounds in virus-infected cells and into their mode of action are currently ongoing and will be published elsewhere.",

To a solution of 21a\u2212c in tert-butanol (2 mL, 0.27 M) contained in a stainless steel bomb reactor, saturated ammonia in tert-butanol (15 mL) was added and the reactor was locked. After being heated to 120\u00b0C with stirring for 15 h, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and coevaporated with MeOH. Without purification, the residue was added to a TFA/H 2 O solution (2:1, v/v, total 15 mL) and heated to 50\u00b0C with stirring for 15 h. After the reaction mixture was evaporated, the residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH, 9/ 1) to give 2a\u2212c.",

The absorbance was measured at 495 nm in a Berthold Mithras LB 940 plate reader, and the values were expressed relative to uninfected (infection) or untreated (viability) samples. The results represent the average of quadruplicate samples expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD. Compounds that were found to be protective were further evaluated in CPE reduction assays by testing 8 different concentrations to determine the EC 50 as previously described. 31, 34 The cytotoxicity (CC 50 ) of the compounds was determined in parallel, and all experiments were performed in quadruplicate. Graph-Pad Prism 8.0.1 was used for EC 50 and CC 50 determination by nonlinear regression. Viral Load Reduction Assays. VeroE6 (CHIKV, ZIKV) cells were seeded at a density of 7.5 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well in 0.5 mL DMEM/8%FCS in 24-well cell culture plates and allowed to adhere overnight. For MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, a cell density of or 6.0 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well of Vero E6 and Vero cells was used, respectively, under the same conditions as described above. The next day, compound dilutions (0\u22121.5 \u03bcM) were prepared in EMEM/2%FCS to which virus was added to yield inocula for infecting the cells with an MOI of 0.1 for CHIKV, MOI of 1 for ZIKV, and MOI of 0.01 for SARS-and MERS-CoV. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 250 \u03bcL/well of the inoculum for 1 h (CHIKV and SARS-and MERS-CoV) or 2 h (ZIKV). After the infection, the cells were washed twice with 1 mL/well warm phosphate-buffered saline and 0.5 mL/well fresh EMEM/2%FCS with different concentrations of compound 2c (0\u22121.5 \u03bcM) was added. The cells were incubated for 30 h (CHIKV) or 48 h (ZIKV, SARS-and MERS-CoV) at 37\u00b0C, after which supernatants were harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for determination of the infectious virus titer by plaque assay. Viability assays were conducted in parallel as described in the previous paragraph. Plaque assays with CHIKV and SARS-CoV on VeroE6 cells, MERS-CoV on Vero cells, and ZIKV on Vero CCL81 cells were performed as described previously. 31,34a,35 Compound 2c was tested at each concentration in duplicate in two independent experiments (n = 4). Graph-Pad Prism 8.0.1 was used for statistical analysis with a oneway ANOVA multiple comparison test. J.-s.Y. and G.K. contributed equally to this work.
