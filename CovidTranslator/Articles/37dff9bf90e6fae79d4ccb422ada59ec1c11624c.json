            "text": "Few studies have estimated the effects of dampness-related exposures and its interaction effects with poor household ventilation on common colds of preschool children. During April 2011eApril 2012, we conducted a cross-sectional survey on home environment and childhood health and collected 13,335 parents-reported questionnaires of 4e6 year-old children in Shanghai, China. In this paper, we investigated associations between the incidence and duration of common colds among these children during the past 12 months before the survey and frequency of opening windows, as well as household dampness-related exposures (indicated by six dampness indicators). Significantly higher incidence (!3 times) and longer duration (!2 weeks) of common cold were found among children with than without these dampness exposures (p-value <0.01 for mold spots and p-value <0.001 for all other indicators). The number of dampness-related indicators had a positive and strong dose-response relationship with common colds (p-trend <0.01). Low frequency of ventilation was also a risk factor for children common colds. After adjusted for the potential confounders in the multiple logistic regression analyses, all dampness-related indicators were significantly associated with the increased odds of common colds and the highest odds ratios was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.16e1.27). We also found that dampness-related exposures and household ventilation habits (p-value for interaction <0.001) had a strong interaction effect on the incidence and duration of common cold. The stratified analysis of ventilation condition displays that the influence of dampness-related exposures has been modified by ventilation. Therefore, good household ventilation habits may have an effect of modification for dampness-related exposures.",

Its effects on residents' health, especially on respiratory health, can't be overlooked. Children, as the susceptible populations, the respiratory disease incidence of them are considerably higher than that of adults. According to the statistics, as usual, the frequency of common cold for adults were 2e5 times per year, and 4e8 times for children [1] . Research results from America [2, 3] , Finland [4] , Italy [5] and so on also demonstrated that children are the high-risk group of respiratory disease. The researchers observed that there is a periodic surge increase of fever and acute respiratory infection on Pediatric Clinic in Shanghai, China [6] . Therefore, the pathological mechanism and influence factors of respiratory infection for childhood are becoming the research hotspot gradually.",

In consequence, plenty of researches have been conducted to explore the association between indoor environment factors and childhood respiratory disease. Dong, G., et al. [13] assessed the effects of housing characteristics and home environmental factors on respiratory symptoms of Chinese children by cross-sectional survey. It has been drawn that home environmental factors including visible mold on walls are particularly important for the development of respiratory morbidity among children. Wang, J. [6, 14] conducted the research on domestic environmental factors and its associations with health in Chongqing during 2008e2011. Lowen, A.C., et al. [11] , stated that influenza virus transmission is dependent on relative humidity and temperature. Lin, Z., et al. [15] found the associations of home dampness signs with childhood asthma and allergic diseases in Urumqi. Hu, Y. [16] performed the research on the association between home dampness and asthma related symptoms among pre-school children of Shanghai during 2011e2013. Norback D., et al. [17] studied associations between fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), respiratory symptoms and airway infections among students and dampness and fungal DNA in schools in Malaysia. They found that building dampness and the mound aspergillus versicolor in schools in Malaysia can be risk factors for impaired respiratory health among the students. Zhao, Z. [18] , Wang, T. [19] , Zhang, M. [20] , Zheng, X. [21] , Wang, H. [22] et al. conducted cross-sectional survey in Taiyuan, Urumqi, Wuhan, Nanjing, Chongqing and other cities in China during 2011e2012. All these results demonstrated that among these environmental factors, the indoor dampness increase the incidence of childhood asthma, rhinitis and other respiratory disease. Heating and ventilation mode affect the indoor air quality, meanwhile they determine the propagation and development of bacteria and virus [23] . They further might be the direct or indirect initiation factors for common cold. It has been stated that household ventilation (opening window in bedroom) were found to be strongly associated with childhood rhinitis [19, 24] , asthma [25] and other allergic symptoms [26] . Low home ventilation rate in combination with moldy odor from the building structure increase the risk for allergic symptoms in children [27] . For college students, who live in the crowded dormitories with low ventilation rate were demonstrated to have more common colds [28] . Therefore, to investigate the effects of household ventilation and indoor environmental dampness exposures on childhood respiratory disease is urgent and important.",

Most of them were in medically, including the mechanism of influenza virus propagation [29, 30] , the prevalence of cough [31] or common cold, the vaccines for common cold [32] , the duration of common cold [33] and also the impact factors [34, 35] . However, few studies focused on the effects of dampness exposures on children's common cold, meanwhile considering the modified impact from ventilation. These two factors play a considerable role in the indoor environment and the research on them are becoming the hot topics. This study is a part of phase one in the China, Child, Homes, Health (CCHH) study which was a national multicenter cross-sectional study of the home environments and childhood asthma, allergies, and airway diseases [36] . Based on the results from a cross-sectional survey in phase one and the data from environment measurements of residential buildings in phase two, the prevalence of children's allergic diseases, such as asthma, rhinitis, eczema and so on, and the associations between them and building environment have been illustrated. However, neither the prevalence of children's respiratory tract infection (RTI), namely common cold, in Shanghai, nor the risk factors of indoor environment for residential buildings were revealed. This study aims to discover how the low ventilation rate effects home dampness in residential buildings and further becomes the risk factor for common cold of children. The interaction effects of these two factors on children's common cold were also investigated.",

Logistic regression analysis was applied to investigate crude associations between indoor environmental dampness, frequency of window opening and children's cold symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to adjust the potential confounders, which included age (4 vs. 5 vs. 6-years-old), gender (male vs. female), family history of atopy, residence location (urban area vs. suburb), ownership of residents (Tenancy vs. Owned) and current environmental tobacco exposure (Yes vs. No). Associations would be indicated by crude odds ratio (OR) and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The significance in statistical analyses would be indicated by p value < 0.05. The multiplicative interaction between household ventilation and dampness-related indicators on cold symptoms of children was addressed by multiple logistic regress model and Cox model, meanwhile the spreadsheet proposed by Knol MJ [43, 44] and Andersson [45] was adopted to analyze the additive interaction and 95% confidence interval between them. The relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI \u00bc RR 11 -RR 10 -RR 01 \u00fe 1), the attributable proportion due to interaction (AP \u00bc RERI/RR 11 ), the synergy index (S\u00bc (RR 11 -1)/[(RR 01 -1)\u00fe(RR 10 -1)]) were three indexes to estimate the interaction effect of household ventilation and dampnessrelated indicators. There are strong indications that the estimated effect on the additive scale of two investigated factors if the RERI is above 0, S above 1 and P-value < 0.05. To evaluate the effects of missing data of dampness related exposure options on questionnaires, the sensitivity analyses were conducted. All of the missing data were set as 1 and 0 respectively to inspect the difference of results. The abnormal error of tested relative humidity was eliminated firstly. The range between 25th-1.5IQR and 75th \u00fe 1.5IQR (IQReinter quartile range) was used as non-outlier range [46] , and then the mean values accompanied with quartiles were calculated.

It could be defined as \"Rarely\" (assigned as 0), when this family \"Never\" open their windows in no less than two seasons; \"Often\" (2), when this family \"Always\" open their window in no less than three seasons; \"Sometime\" (1), when the window opening mode of this family belongs to those excluding situations described above.

About half of them (54%) open their windows \"Sometimes\". This index could also be considered as the natural ventilation condition in qualitatively.

For a single family, there might be several dampness-related indicators reported, so the total number of dampness-related indicators was proposed here to describe the dampness level, and it could be expressed as n, where it might be equal to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. The frequency of the total dampness-related indicators is displayed in Fig. 3 . The valid samples for this statistics were 8068 by abandoning the sample missing any value of these six dampness-related indicators. It demonstrates that the residential buildings with one or two kinds of dampness exposures accounted for 49.3%. In other words, half of the residence in shanghai have more than one dampness problem. Less than 1% residence was exposure to the environment with all six dampness-related indicators. The analysis on the validity of subjective questionnaire in evaluating dwelling home dampness and indoor odors based on Cross-sectional survey and on-site inspection in Shanghai have been already conducted before [48] . In the paper, the consistency of the dampness exposures from children's parents-reported questionnaires in Phase I and on-site tester inspection in Phase II were analyzed. According to the observed, positive, and negative proportional agreement (P o , P pos , and P neg ), parents and inspectors had substantial/prefect consistencies in dampness exposure indicators (P o \u00bc 0.51e0.96). Therefore, the validity of the dampness-related exposure from questionnaires has been confirmed.",

To further indicate the relationship between dampness-related factors and children common cold. The relationship between the total numbers of dampness indicators (DI) and the incidence and duration of common cold were established.

This has been stated by other researchers before [27, 50] . The dampness exposures in this paper covered from odor to spots. It is more comprehensive. Window opening mode was directly related to the natural ventilation condition, as discussed before. Therefore, there is a hypothesis proposed by current results that poor household natural ventilation could be in somehow associated with severe dampness exposures and further increase the risk for common cold symptoms in children. It was consistent with the statement by previous research [51] . In other words, good household natural ventilation (HNV) could weaken the dampness exposures. Then the association between HNR and DI was discovered in this paper, as seen in Table 4 and Fig. 4 . Table 4 indicates that the frequency of all these six dampness indicators increased with the natural ventilation improving. Good natural ventilation was positively associated with less dampness exposures, which could also be illustrated by the adjusted odds ratio for dampness index in Fig. 4 . With the \"frequent\" natural ventilation as reference, the risk of household ventilation on each dampness level was significant. Poor natural ventilation resulted in severe dampness level for AOR value above 1 and poor ventilation had a stronger association with high dampness level for the AOR value grew up with dampness index increased (the highest one presented at DI equal to 5, AOR, 95% CI: 1.60, 1.24e2.08). It provides a strong evidence that poor home ventilation could encourage dampness problems generation. This has been stated by previous research. H\u20ac agerhed-Engman et al. has also presented that a moldy odor along the skirting board and severe moldy odor in indoor air were significantly associated with a low ventilation rate [27, 52] . The primary results from phase II in our group have also provided the general evidence on this statement. The concentration of CO 2 for 24 h in children's bedroom was recorded and it was then taken as the trace gas to calculate the natural ventilation rate. The average values were 1.51 h \u00c01 and 2.28 h \u00c01 for day and night time respectively. High risk of moldy odor, visible mold in the wall covering and window pane condensation was associated with low ventilation rate. Moreover, ventilation rate in winter was lower than that in summer and with the increasing of it, the frequency of children cough and eczema decreased. Therefore, the significance of home ventilation is noticeable. To eliminate indoor dampness problems, providing favourable home ventilation is efficient. The risk of high frequency and long duration of common cold due to dampness exposures stratified by the frequency of opening window in different seasons. The results (in autumn, for example) were listed in Table 5 , the results from other three seasons were listed in supplementary materials Tables S2e4. It displays that with the modification effect of natural ventilation, the risk of dampness exposures on both the incidence and duration of children's common colds decreased. It also confirms that the natural ventilation not only weaken the household dampness exposures, but also reduce the risk of dampness exposure on children health.",

It also illustrated that the natural decline rate is lower when indoor relative humidity is 50e60% than that under 35% of RH [56] . Dry environment may cause the bacteria/virus cell death because of protein denaturation and brine concentration. It testifies that humidity condition not only affects the propagation of bacteria, but also determines its survival time [57] . When RH was 15%, 35% and 80%, the staphylococcus aureus could survive for 9 \u00b1 2 days, 21 \u00b1 4 days and 67 \u00b1 7 days respectively. The relationship between relative humidity and survival time of bacteria could be established by regression, as seen in Fig. 5 . It could be deduced that with the increasing of the measured RH, the survival time of relevant bacteria increased. The researchers also conducted experiments to investigate the association between the transmission of flu virus and indoor relative humidity. The results showed that in the 28 C environment, the transmission speed of flu virus accelerated with the relative humidity increasing [11] . Several kinds of bacteria/virus with high morbidity were analyzed. Although these were limited, it aims to explore the environmental inducement of child's respiratory infection (common cold). The results from regression analysis of virus survival time and relative humidity were identical to that drawn from survey. They reflected that indoor environmental dampness was the risk factor of common cold for children. Furthermore, the sample sizes largely decrease from 13,335 to 8086 when we conducted the analysis dampness index, as seen in Table 4 . It is due to the missing data of dampness -related questions. The statistical principle for creation of dampness index is abandoning any questionnaire with no less than one missing data. After elimination of six items, the left questionnaires are 8086. To explore the effect of missing data on the identification of common cold risk, the sensitivity analysis was conducted. There were three cases for this analysis: 1) assigning all the missing data as 1 (existing related dampness feature); 2) assigning all the missing data as 0 (non-existing related dampness feature); 3) removing the missing data (used in this paper). The association between dampness index and common cold of children was analyzed by using these three methods. Table 6 displays the results obtained from three cases. It could be found that when the missing data were assigned with 0 or 1, the adjusted odds ratio for common cold incidence and duration accordingly decreased in comparison with being assignments before. However, the AORs of case 1 and case 2 were all still above 1.00 and they were consistent with case 3, which represented that the testing results of AOR for common cold of children were insensitive to missing data of dampness index. Therefore, the analysis conclusion drawn from case 3 was convictive.",

(1) All these results and conclusion were obtained from CCHH phase I e Questionnaires, so the dampness feature and home ventilation situation were obtained by reporting and they were subjective. It needs more data from phase II e Measurements to verify and improve these outcomes. (2) In the same way, household natural ventilation should be determined by density of indoor CO 2 from field measurements, then the correlation between it and window opening mode could be built [27, 50] . The related work has been conducted by other member in our group. (3) Besides, indoor temperature and relative humidity are connected [58] , so different combinations of temperature and relative humidity may have different effects on the incidence of common cold. It was not analyzed in this paper. Although these were limited, it aims to explore the environmental inducement of child's respiratory infection (common cold). The results from this survey were identical to that drawn from analysis of virus survival time and relative humidity in literature. They reflected that indoor environmental dampness was the risk factor of common cold for children. Therefore, improving the insulation and humidity control performance and adopting the appropriate home ventilation mode to avoid environmental dampness, which provides the necessary condition for propagation of bacteria, could effectively eliminate the incidence of common cold among children.",
