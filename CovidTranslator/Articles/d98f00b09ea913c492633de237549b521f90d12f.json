            "text": "To improve understanding of severe group A streptococcal (GAS) disease in Europe and achieve an integrated picture of these infections, the Strep-EURO project comprising 11 countries started in September 2002. A European case definition for severe invasive GAS disease was agreed upon amongst all participants. In order to obtain nation-wide coverage, information on the project was given to infectioncontrol units, relevant hospitals and microbiological laboratories. A clinical questionnaire containing background identification data, possible predisposing factors, portal of entry of infection, epidemiological risk factors, source of isolate, clinical condition, complications and outcome, was used for each case. Enhanced surveillance of GAS invasive disease commenced on 1 January 2003 for a two-year period. By July 2004, over 5000 invasive GAS isolates were collected of which more than 3000 were from UK. The disease incidence rate in the different countries seems to vary from 2 to 3.8 per 100,000 population. Molecular methods for typing and clonal identification of clinical isolates were used. An overall increase of new invasive types is noted. Higher emm types (77, 78, 81, 82, 83, 87, 89) were thus reported from almost all partners, in contrast to types 1, 3 and 28 being predominant for several years. In Sweden, for example, emm types 81 and 89 accounted for a majority of isolates. This unusual change of type distribution in Europe is of serious concern. A high level of MLS antibiotic resistance in some countries (France, Italy) and very frequent tetracycline resistance in almost all countries was noted. Furthermore, pathogenic aspects of severe GAS disease, such as proteolytic activation of the contact system, and selected virulence factors, such as surface proteins and superantigens, were investigated. A new Strep-EURO website (www.strep-euro.lu.se) was constructed and updated regularly. The website is linked with other, relevant websites and contains both an \"intra-net\" site accessible to those persons participating within the project, and an \"extra-net\" site for the general public. A central database for severe GAS cases, receiving clinical and laboratory information from the local databases was also established. Strep-EURO has now created a European network for epidemiological analysis and surveillance of severe streptococcal disease in ten EU and one Associated Countries.",

Twelve percent of cases occurred in children (<18 years). Ninety percent of cases were bacteraemic, 10% had septic arthritis and 9% pneumonia. Other clinical manifestations included toxic shock-like syndrome (6%), necrotising fasciitis (5%), puerperal sepsis (3%) and meningitis (1%). Skin lesions/wounds were the most common predisposing factor, with injecting drug use reported in 30% of cases; 28% had no predisposing/risk factors identified. Nineteen percent of cases were reported as having died within 7 days of diagnosis. Local microbiological analysis identified 4% of GAS isolates as erythromycin resistant. Type characterisation of strains using a combination of serological and sequencing techniques revealed over 35 M-types, with M1, M3 and M87most common.",

Mice (N = 15) were inoculated using an aerosolisation device for 45 min. Five mice were sacrificed at day 0, 7 and 14 of the study. C. burnetii detection was performed by Light Cycler Nested PCR assay in lungs and blood samples. Antibodies to phases I and II C. burnetii whole cell antigens were determined in the sera by immunofluorescence testing. Inflammatory reactions in lungs and spleen samples were investigated by histological and immunohistological analysis. C. burnetii was detected by genomic amplification in the blood of mice sacrificed at day 7 and in all lung samples. All infected mice sacrificed at day 14 had developed antibodies to C. burnetii phases I and II antigens (titer of 1:1600). Inflammatory infiltrates were seen in the lungs of mice sacrificed at day 7 and 14, bacteria were detected by immunohistochemistry in the macrophages cells. In our study, we demonstrated that the infection first resulted in an interstitial pneumonia. C. burnetii was then released and may spread hematogenously to other organs. As a conclusion, this murine model of aerosol-induced experimental Q fever is the first step for studies on acute Q fever, especially in terms of pathogenicity.",

Cytokines elicited by bacterial superantigens have been suggested to play a central role in severe systemic clinical manifestations of gram-positive sepsis. Analyses of in vivo and in vitro cytokine responses in patients with severe (streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and/or necrotizing fasciitis) or nonsevere (no toxic shock or deep-tissue involvement) invasive GAS infection revealed a direct correlation between cytokine responses and severity of invasive disease. Significantly elevated frequencies of pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed in acute phase peripheral blood mononuclear cells from severe cases as compared to non-severe cases. Analyses of tissue biopsies from patients with GAS tissue infections revealed a similar correlation between the magnitudes of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular Th1 cytokines, and severity of infection. This difference in in vivo cytokine responses during acute phase could be reproduced when paired age and sex-matched severe and non-severe cases infected with a clonal GAS strain were tested in vitro during their convalescent phase for immune response to culture supernatants from their infecting isolate. These findings indicated that the propensity to be either a high or a low responder to superantigens is a stable feature of the host, which may contribute to severity of disease. Further studies revealed that specific HLA class II haplotypes conferred protection from severe disease, whereas others increased the risk of severe disease. Functional analysis revealed that the risk HLA types promoted significantly higher cytokine responses against GAS superantigens than did the protective ones. Taken together the studies show that HLA class II molecules that influence the magnitude of immune responses to GAS superantigens play a pivotal role in determining the outcome of invasive GAS infection.",

Managerial interests could be directed towards the financial consequences of MRSA since there is robust evidence demonstrating cost-benefits for hospitals from various control initiatives. We should also consider the cost to an individual patient as well as society itself. Some of these are non-calculable. Savings can be obtained from both general and specific control interventions-the former encompassing estimates such as reduction in hospital bed-days or overall costs of hospital-acquired infection; the latter alludes to hand-washing programmes, screening or antibiotic prescribing. Hospitals with rising numbers of MRSA patients experience an increasing financial burden, which influences both healthcare policies and overall societal costs. As with the indefinable impact upon human health and well-being, these will escalate without managerial and political commitment. Before the introduction of any clinical improvement programme, resources must first be released before implementation. From the evidence presented, it is clear that control efforts will not only pay for themselves, but would generate other direct and indirect benefits to individual patients and society as a whole.",

The present study was therefore conducted in order to define the pathogenicity of these petite mutants. To do this, two wild-type isolates of C. glabrata were compared with their respective fluconazole or ethidium bromide-induced petite mutants, regarding the carbohydrate and protein composition of the cell wall, as well as their surface physical properties and expression of CgEPA1 gene encoding an adhesin, but also their adherence capabilities and their virulence in mice. Thus, flow cytometric analysis of cell wall carbohydrates using several fluorescent lectins showed an increased binding of mutant cells to concanavalin A compared with their parent isolates, suggesting a greater availability or an increased amount of glucose-mannose residues at the cell surface in petite mutants. Likewise, quantitative differences were shown by SDS-PAGE in the surface proteins of blastoconidia between parent and mutant isolates. Regarding the surface physical properties, no significant differences were seen in the electrophoretic mobility determined by microelectrophoresis, but two-phase partitioning using hexadecane as the organic phase revealed a lower hydrophobicity for all petite mutants compared with parent isolates. Moreover, mutant cells exhibited an important overexpression of the gene CgEPA1 as revealed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR compared with their parent isolates, but the adherence capacities to Caco-2 cells, a human enterocyte cell line, were not significantly different. Finally, as suggested by their slower growth, petite mutants were less virulent than parent isolates in an experimental model of systemic infection using immunocompetent mice. Together these results suggest that one can disregard C. glabrata petite mutants clinically. However, due to their markedly decreased virulence, these mutants may constitute valuable tools for the characterization of virulence factors of this yeast, and proteomic studies of the changes associated with petite mutations are now in progress.",

Indeed, during a 3-year surveillance in facilities of Franche-Comt\u00e9 region, incidence of MRSA colonisations/infections was 0.09 and 0.9, respectively, in LTCF and acute care facilities. The objectives of this study were to establish the frequency of MRSA acquisition in a 250 beds-LTCF and to discuss the roles of screening for MRSA carriers, the type of isolation to be implemented and the efficiency of chemical decontamination. The combination of the prevalence of MRSA carriage and MRSA screening upon admission allowed us to evaluate the MRSA acquisition risk according to the characteristics of the patients and the inter-hospital transfers. The prevalence study showed that 15.2% of the patients were MRSA carriers. On the admission, 23.3% of the patients were positive with MRSA. Among MRSA-free patients on admission, without any transfer, 14% became positive for MRSA, all had lost their autonomy. Chemical decolonisation (nasal mupirocin + cutaneous chlorexidine) was efficient for 22 patients out of 25 (88%). In LTCF, the frequency of MRSA cross-transmission could not be evaluated on the basis of clinical samples. MRSA acquisition occurred exclusively among totally dependent patients. Thus, technical isolation rules should be respected when carrying out treatments, the efficacy of such isolation being unaffected by the mobility of patients and their \"resocialisation\". Chemical decolonisation was efficient and made it possible to reduce the number of days of technical isolation. Given the increase in morbidity associated with MRSA observed in numerous hospitals, the emergence of a community-based disease linked to these strains and the emergence of glycopeptide-resistant strains, the application of a voluntary strategy including screening, isolation and decolonization in R-CCF appears to be an urgent matter of priority.",

A total of 222 faecal GREF (N = 136) and glycopeptide susceptible (N = 86) E. faecium (GSEF) isolates were obtained from farmers and poultry on three separate occasions in 1998-1999. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and plasmid DNA analyses discerned 22 GREF and 32 GSEF PFGE types within shifting polyclonal animal and human E. faecium populations and transferable plasmid mediated vanA-resistance. Examples of dominant persistent GREF PFGE types supported the notion that environmentally well-adapted GREF-types may counteract the reversal of resistance. PFGE analyses, sequencing of thepurK housekeeping gene, and partial typing of the vanA-containing Tn1546 suggested a common animal and human reservoir of glycopeptide resistance. Inverse PCR amplification and sequence analyses targeting the right end of the Tn1546-plasmid junction fragment strongly indicated the presence of a common single Tn1546-plasmid mediated element in 20 of 22 GREF PFGE types. This observation was further strengthened by vanY-Z hybridization analyses of plasmid DNA as well as the finding of physical linkage between Tn1546 and a putative postsegregation killing system (PSK) in seven GREF PFGE types. In conclusion, our observations suggest that the molecular unit of persistence of glycopeptide resistance is a common mobile plasmid mediated vanA-containing element within a polyclonal GREF-population changing over time. In addition we propose that \"plasmid addiction systems\" may contribute to persistence of GREF in non-selective environments.",

In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), S. aureus (SA) is usually the first pathogen recovered from the respiratory tract, and the rate of MRSA has increased during the last decade. The respective prevalences of methicillin-susceptible SA (MSSA) and MRSA in the French CF population have been established at 54.6% and 10.9% in 2001 (Observatoire National de la Mucoviscidose). The present study was undertaken to assess the characteristics of the MRSA-colonised CF population and to analyse the antimicrobial susceptibilities and genetic relationships of isolates. One hundred and eleven MRSA colonised patients from 17 CF Centers in 11 regions were included. The mean age of acquisition is 13.7 years (<1-37); colonisation is chronic in 65% cases. Of 82 documented cases, 54 (66%) had been hospitalized during the prior year, whereas 28 (34%) had not; 40 (49%) received an antistaphylococcal antibiotic shortly (<30 days) after MRSA diagnosis, mainly cotrimoxazole (19 patients) or pristinamycin (11 patients); a glycopeptide has been used in five patients. Among 116 non-redundant isolates, most (88: 75.9%) were susceptible to gentamicin and resistant to tobramycin and amikacin. Pristinamycin, cotrimoxazole, fusidic acid and rifampicin were effective on 100%, 96.5%, 78.4% and 78.4% of isolates, respectively. Seven gentamicin resistant isolates exhibited a reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides. One hundred and fourteen isolates recovered from 109 patients were compared by use of pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and classified in 41 types: 26/41 types were unique, whereas 15 included two to 27 isolates. Two types were predominant, involving 23 and 14 patients, in eight and six regions, respectively. In 8/17 CF Centres, several patients harboured the same type.",

A prospective study was performed on serum specimens received on a routine basis for HIV testing: 1443 blood samples were tested with the three assays. The sensitivity was 100% for the three tests. The specificity assessed on repeated false-positive samples was 99.86%, 99.03% and 99.65% for VIDAS HIV DUO Ultra, VIDAS HIV DUO and AxSYM HIV Ag/Ab Combo, respectively. In addition, 14 seroconversion panels were tested with the VIDAS DUO Ultra and AxSYM HIV Ag/Ab Combo assays. For four of these panels, a positive signal was detected one blood sampling point earlier with the VIDAS DUO Ultra assay. These results indicate that the VIDAS HIV DUO Ultra exhibits an improved specificity with comparison to the former version of this assay. In addition, given its excellent sensitivity and the availability of independent results for the antigen and the antibody assays, the test is appropriated to the early detection of HIV seroconversion.",

The assay will help to understand the natural history of HDV infection and to define guidelines for the management of chronic delta hepatitis. Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) is an ubiquitous and highly seroprevalent virus in the general population. Two variants A and B of the HHV-6 have been identified on the basis of genotypic and phenotypic differences, but many questions are pending concerning their specific epidemiological and pathogenic properties. Although both variants may infect human, HHV-6 variant B accounts for the majority of clinical manifestations during primary infection and reactivation (encephalitis, hematopoiesis disorders, febrile cutaneous rash), whereas the variant A has been occasionally associated to pathologies (fetal hydrops, encephalitis). Both variants may be detected in lymph nodes and lung tissue without clinical impact. The aim of our study was to develop a rapid, sensitive and specific method to identify HHV-6 variants in different types of biological samples, especially in case of mixed infection. We evaluated a technique adapted from the real-time quantitative method previously developed in our laboratory, which included the change of the consensual reverse primer into two variant-specific primers. Five different strains of HHV-6 variant A (GS, SIE, TAN) and variant B (HST, MAR) have been used either separately or mixed (variants A and B) in various proportions. For both variants, the sensitivity was 10 genomic copies. Regarding specificity, human DNA or other herpesvirus DNA (HSV, VZV, HCMV, EBV, HHV-7, HHV-8) were not amplified. In case of mixed infections, one variant (A or B) could be detected in the presence of more than 10 3 -fold more copies of the other one. Various biological samples including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue biopsies, bone marrow and oral mucosal swabs have been tested. For the samples for which a previous identification of HHV-6 variant was performed using a reference method, we obtained a total concordance. HHV-6 variant B was mainly identified and variant A or mixed infection could be evidenced. Of note, variant A infection was observed in case of neurological disorders. This new method constitutes a useful tool to identify HHV-6 variants in various biological samples, even in the case of mixed infections. We have also evidenced a neurological tropism of the variant A associated to encephalitis in infant or adult.",

Department of Microbiology, Medical School, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece PCR is becoming the new standard for virological diagnosis of the infections of the central nervous system (CNS). Use of this test has been shown to have the impact on patient management as measured by shortened patient stays and reduction of empirical therapy administration. This study aimed at reporting our experience over the last years in the detection and management of herpesviruses and enteroviruses (EVs) induced CNS infections by using PCR assays. A total of 127 consecutive CSF specimens from patients hospitalized between April 2001 and August 2004 to the University Hospital of Ioannina with clinically suspected viral CNS infection were tested for the presence of the herpesvirus and EV genome using Herpes Consensus and Enterovirus Consensus assays (Argene Biosoft, France). The Herpes Consensus assay allowed the simultaneously amplification of the six major herpesviruses in a single PCR: herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV1, HSV2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). The Enterovirus Consensus assay allowed the reverse transcription and amplification of all 64 prototypes of EVs. Amplified products were detected by microplate hybridization. The specificity and sensitivity of the assays were evaluated with samples from three external control proficiency panels. Overall, 42 (33%) of the CSF samples tested were positive in the PCR. HSV1 was detected in one adult (0.8%) with encephalitis, VZV was detected in one adult (0.8%) with meningitis, and EVs were detected in 40 children (31.5%) with meningitis and/or encephalitis. None of the specimens tested was positive for HSV2, CMV, EBV and HHV-6 genomes. From the 42 positive CSF specimens, none presented herpesvirus and EVs coinfection in the CNS The precise diagnosis of viral CNS infections was available within 24-48 h, which allowed for a better clinical management of the patients in terms of the duration of hospitalization and the specific therapeutic intervention. In conclusion the Consensus PCR methodology enabled the rapid detection of the herpesviruses and EVs in CSF and provided a reliable, noninvasive tool in the diagnosis of viral CNS infections.",

Strains of S. aureus RN4220 and its mutator counterpart inactivated in the mutL gene by the insertion of a suicide plasmid were used. Mutation frequency determined on rifampicin containing medium was 45 times higher with the mutator strain. The behaviour of the two strains was studied separately in vitro and in rat model of osteomyelitis. Competition studies were performed in 50 rats co-infected with the two strains at a same ratio. Ten rats were sacrificed at five different times from 3 days to sixth weeks post-inoculation. A similar experiment was performed after a first in vivo passage for one derivate of each strain. To study the effect of the mutator phenotype in the emergence of antibiotic resistance, 20 rats were infected by each strain separately and treated with rifampicin sc 20 mg/kg bid for 5 days. Animals were sacrificed 48 h after the last antibiotic injection. No difference was observed between the separate growth of the two strains in vitro and in vivo indicating no fitness defect in the mutator strain. In contrast, competitive studies indicated that the mutator strain was clearly disadvantaged since it was found in all rats and all study times at lower bacterial titers (range 4.6 log cfu/bone versus 3 log cfu/bone, P < 0.05). In addition, this competitive loss of the mutator strain was amplified after a second passage in vivo, with a 100-fold difference in cfu counts between the two strains (P < 0.05). In animals treated with rifampicin, resistant mutant appeared in one from eight animals infected with the mutator strain, while no rifampicin resistant mutant was detected in rats infected with the wild strain. We concluded that, in a model of chronic bone infection due to S. aureus, the mutator phenotype was associated with a decreased fitness. However, under antibiotic selective pressure, this initial disadvantage could be compensated by the increased rate of emergence of antibiotic resistant mutant and may lead to competitive advantage.",

The most common suspected diagnoses leading to an AT were respiratory tract infections (n = 62, including 51 pneumonias) and urinary tract infections (UTI) (n = 19). Patients with pneumonia received more frequently a third generation cephalosporin (3GC) or amoxycillin-clavulanate alone or associated with fluoroquinolones (FQ) (40/51, 79%) than amoxicillin alone or associated with a macrolide (6/51, 12%).

OXA-58 was weakly related to other oxacillinases sharing 33%, 47% and 48% amino acid identity with OXA-10, OXA-24 and OXA-23, respectively. The aim of this study was to analyze the spread of this oxacillinase gene as source of carbapenem-resistance in A. baumannii in that hospital. From August 2003 to March 2004, seven carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates were collected. Six were from six patients from the burns unit and one was an environmental isolate, collected in the surgery block during systematic air sampling. PCR experiments using primers specific for the bla OXA-58 gene gave positive results for the seven carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates. These carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates had the same bla OXA-58 -positive plasmid of ca. 30 kb after plasmid extraction and hybridization with the bla OXA-58 probe. Genotypic comparison was performed for evaluating clonality of the isolates. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was realized after digestion of whole-cell DNAs with ApaI restriction enzymes. PFGE analysis showed that the six carbapenem-resistant isolates from patients corresponded likely to a single clone, whereas the isolate from the environment, that was also bla OXA-58 positive, was of a different genotype. Identification of the same bla OXA-58 -positive plasmid in two different clones of A. baumannii indicated the spread of this plasmid. This study constitutes the second description of an outbreak of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii producing a plasmid-encoded carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinase, after that of OXA-23-producing A. baumanniistrains in Brazil. As observed for the other carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinase genes, bla OXA-58 was not present in the form of a gene cassette in a class 1 integron, but associated with insertion sequences. Thus, spread of a novel \u2424-lactamase-mediated resistance mechanism was identified, underlying emergence of novel carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzymes in A. baumannii.",

In the recent past, multi-resistant A. baumannii strains have been described. During 2003 summer, an A. baumanni outbreak resulting in colonisation and infection was observed in our hospital. Amongst the isolated strains, none displayed the \"national epidemic\" clone producing the VEB-1 extended spectrum betalactamase (ESBL). The multiresistant strains we observed had thus two characteristic antibiotypes: in the intensive care unit, strains were exclusively susceptible to imipenem, tobramycin and amikacin while in the Burn unit, strains were only susceptible to amikacin.",

The resistant strains were more likely isolated in the intensive care unit (60%). However, clinical samples were from various origins: non protected respiratory samples (43%) as well as blood cultures (5%). Simultaneous analysis of pulsotypes and antibiotypes was able to highlight that the outbreak observed in the intensive care unit could be linked to an initially endemic clone that had been isolated from 2001 and was responsible for the four previously mentioned antibiotypes. In the same manner, a second clone responsible for an ESBL phenotype was sporadically present in our institution. However, the strains isolated in the Burn unit were also genetically related one to each other, but the specific clone responsible appeared only in 2003.",

Prevalence of qnr is between 2% and 11%, referring first studies in China, Spain and USA, and is unknown in France. The strains harbouring qnr gene are usually producing plasmid-mediated AmpC-type-\u2424-lactamase (PCase) or extended spectrum \u2424-lactamase (ESBL). We have screened 478 nalidixic acid (Nal) resistant enterobacterial strains isolated in Henri Mondor hospital between 2002 and 2004 (316 Escherichia coli,100 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 28 Enterobacter spp., 20 Citrobacter freundii, 9Serratia marcescens, 3 Proteus and 2 Providencia) for the presence of qnr gene by PCR using specific primers amplifying an intragenic 543 bp fragment. Among them, 58 had a phenotype in concordance with a ESBL and three with a PCase. Nal-S strains (n = 20) were tested as negative controls. Positive control was the original strain K. pneumoniae UAB1. Each strain for which the PCR was positive was tested with two other couples of primers generating a 627 or a 661 bp intragenic fragment of qnr. PCR products when obtained were sequenced. Among the 478 strains, 441 were PCR negative, 33 were PCR positive with the first couple of primers, three of them were PCR positive with two couples of primers, and only one strain was positive with the three couples of primers. For all the strains except the latter one, PCR products did not have the expected size and sequences were different from qnr. For the only strain that was positive with the three couples of primers, the sequence of the PCR products was identical to qnr excepted one base, resulting in a silent mutation. This strain was an Enterobacter cloacae with a high level of resistance to ciprofloxacin and had a ESBL phenotype. We described the first strain ofEnterobacter cloacae that harbours the qnr gene known to mediate plasmid-borne quinolone resistance. This was the only strain among 478 enterobacterial strains tested, resulting in a prevalence of 0.2% in this serie. Large scale survey among hospitals with investigation of all the enterobacterial species will be necessary to confirm this low prevalence rate of qnr in France.",

This study showed that NalR clinical isolates of E. coli, either CipS or CipR, harboured at least one mutation in the topoisomerase genes (gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE) and that NalR CipR isolates harboured the association of mutations in two or three of these genes. Whereas we did not find any gyrB mutant, we described the first clinical isolate harbouring the parE mutation Leu445His. Unknown mutations observed in gyrB, parC and parE should be investigated for their involvement in quinolone resistance. Travellers in tropical countries import in France more than 5000 P. falciparum (Pf) isolates annually from which 10-15% are sent to us for typing. Isolates from symptomatic patients without previous drug intake (HPLC measurement) are selected for drug susceptibility testing with in vitro tests (1993-2004, n = 1100) and with molecular markers (1996-2004, n = 2900) . Characteristics of corresponding patients are similar over the years, including: African natives (71%); living in France (86%); travelling in Africa (98,9%); returning either from Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Mali or Comoros (68%); mean age (32 years); children under 15 years of age (14%); and sex ratio (M:F = 1.78). Among these, prevalence of Pf chloroquine resistance (in vitro IC 50 > 100 nM) is 0.41 in 1993-2002, and 0.55 in 2003-2004 ; prevalence of Pf cycloguanil resistance (in vitro IC 50 > 500 nM or DHFR mutation S108N) is 0.28 in 1993-1996, 0.51 in 1997-2002, and 0.62 in 2003-2004 . Foot-step increase of Pf resistance was observed for the two antimalarials. These results are used on an annual basis to adjust prophylactic recommendations for travellers to each endemic country (invs.sante.fr/beh/). Following WHO guidelines for use of antimalarials, we consider now a prevalence of 0.25 of resistance to chloroquine plus cycloguanil in Pf from an endemic country as the upper limit for recommending prophylactic use of the association (countries with Pf resistance of group 2): Togo and Benin exceeded this limit in 1996 -1997 and Senegal in 2003 -2004 . Prevalence of Pf resistance to mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil or doxycycline is still under 0.25 in all endemic countries and are recommended for prophylaxis in countries with chloroquine plus cycloguanil Pf resistance >0.25 (countries of group three). Indirect evidence for efficiency of these recommendations is gained from the figure of 15 travellers among 728 Pf attack analysed by CNRCP in 2003 having correctly followed them (2%). Since the 1999 French consensus, chloroquine or sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine are no longer used for Pf treatment. Quinine resistance has only been detected in this period in few Pf isolates from Asia and no chloroquine failure was suspected in imported Plasmodium vivax, ovale or malariae.",

The combination is indicated for malaria prophylaxis in areas with chloroquine resistance and for treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Since 2002, both indications gained increased favour of French physicians and travellers, owing to it is good tolerance. From the beginning of prescription in Europe and North America, six therapeutic failures were published yet, one early therapeutic failure (ETF) and five late one (LTF). In three cases, failure was confirmed by blood drug dosage. A unique mutated codon (268) on the parasite target of atovaquone, cytochrome b, was present in 4/6. Association between therapeutic failure and cytochrome b mutation needs further confirmation. This last two years, we were informed of 251 atovaquone-proguanil treatments in travellers contamined mostly in West Africa and Comoros. From 148 cases with clinical follow up files, five failures were recorded, three ETF and two LTF. Isolates were analysed by dosing d 3 residual drugs in plasma, measuring in vitro atovaquone susceptibility and sequencing d 0 and d fail cytochrome b gene. In two cases, bad observance and/or poor absorption is the likely failure explanation. Two out of three isolates from true therapeutic failure presented with a single mutation causing amino acid change, respectively: M116I and Y268S. This compare to a series of 85 isolates, without known failures, in which only one mutation (codon 314) was identified. These results confirm high conservation of the Plasmodium cytochrome b house keeping gene. Three other failure cases require more analysis to conclude. In spite of fast resistance emergence when atovaquone was used alone, its combination with proguanil exhibited satisfactory efficacy, tolerance and safety. Drug resistance associated with mutations on the cytochrome b gene leading to therapeutic failures of P. falciparum are yet rarely encountered with atovaquone-proguanil.",

Introduction: Antimicrobial disk diffusion susceptibility testing is devoted in a clinical context to predict whether an antibiotic regimen will be effective. Test performance should be evaluated through predictive values of a report, i.e. the test ability to predict true-S, true-I, true-R isolates. This approach implies that variation of susceptibility prevalence (frequency of susceptible, intermediate and resistant isolates) affects the predictive value of a result, simply because the level of discrepancies will vary with the prevalence of S, I, R categories. The prevalence effect is traditionally taken into account through positive and negative predictive values, but has never been evaluated with three-class result tests such as agar diffusion based susceptibility testing.",

The diagnosis, presently based on direct examination and conventional cultures, is difficult, time consuming and often delayed or prevented due to the relatively slow growth of these bacteria, and the empiric therapeutic decision before sampling. The objective of this study was to develop a PCR-based assay for the rapid detection of Nocardia directly from human clinical samples. The technique consisted in a 16S-specific amplification combined with a chemiluminescent hybridization. The probe was obtained by PCR from DNA of the type strain Nocardia asteroidesATCC 19247 T . DNA extraction and amplification from specimens (bronchoalveolar liquid, skin biopsy and cerebral abscess) seeded with serial dilutions of Nocardia asteroides ATCC 19247 T allowed the evaluation of the analytical sensitivity of the assay which reached 10 3 CFU/reaction after agarose gel electrophoresis and 1 CFU/reaction after transfer and hybridization. The applicability of the PCR assay to diagnose human nocardiosis was evaluated by investigating eighteen clinical human samples. For patients with nocardiosis confirmed by conventional cultures, clinical specimens were positive with a sharp chemiluminescent signal after hybridization. No amplification was observed for 20 clinical samples from patients with confirmed tuberculosis used as a negative control. These results highlighted the high specificity and sensibility of the PCR protocol presented in this study. It appeared useful in the rapid diagnosis of nocardiosis directly from clinical samples without culture, resulting in timely and appropriate clinical management that can amount to significant savings for patients. and this technique became current in routine. We tested hybridization protected ARNr or HPA (Gen-Probe) compared to standards techniques (direct immunofluorescence) (Direct IFD) for C. trachomatis, examination and culture for N. gonorrhoae). The doubtful or conflicting tests were confirmed by a technique of competition (PCA). We studied 208 patients (144 endo-cervical samples and 64 urethral samples). Our results were analysed statistically. In woman, 21 cases of C. trachomatis were diagnosed (14.58%) and two cases of N. gonorrhoae (1.38%). In man, 10 cases of C. trachomatis were diagnosed (15.62%) and five cases of N. gonorrhoae (7.81%). In conclusion, the technique of HPA enabled us to improve the diagnosis of these two types of bacteria, which could be underestimated by the standards methods. Objective: Rapid appropriate antibacterial treatment is important to improve the prognosis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococccus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. RT-PCR can identify S. aureus (Sa) and detect methicillin resistance. We used it directly in positive blood culture (BC) bottles with Gram positive cocci (GPC) upon direct smear examination (DSE) to provide clinicians with fast and accurate results and evaluate the impact of these results on treatment changes and appropriateness.",

We have characterized an emerging MRSA clone responsible either for hospital-acquired infections and communityacquired infections and containing the tst gene encoding the toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1). One hundred and three strains of tst + S. aureus were collected from 42 cities by the French Reference Center for Staphylococci between 2002 and 2003 and were characterized by phenotypic and genotypic methods. Most of mecA + tst + strains (n = 25) harboured the accessory gene regulator (agr) two allele and only two strains had an agr 3 allele. A contrario most of mecA \u2212 tst + strains (n = 70) had an agr 3 allele and only five strains had an agr 2 allele. The clonal origin of all of the mecA + tst + agr 2 strains was demonstrated by determining the pulsotype, the sequence type (ST5), the antibiotic resistance profile, the type of staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec (SCCmec IV) and the toxinic profile. These strains were responsible of infections that occurred predominantly among children (median age = 3.3 years), either in hospitals and in the community. This clone may have arisen de novo through insertion of mecA gene into the mecA \u2212 tst+ agr 2 clone as demonstrating by comparing the pulsedfield gel electrophoresis types that differed by a single band shift due to insertion of the SCCmec IV. Our findings suggested that this MRSA clone probably did not emerge from the others pandemic MRSA clones ST5 such as New York/ Japan Clone.",

Objective: Epidemiological studies done in the United States have demonstrated high hospitalisation and outpatient rates attributable to influenza in children between the ages of 6-23 months; rates being comparable to those seen in children with high risk conditions has led to recommendations for immunization in this age group. Due to The paucity of epidemiological studies on Influenza in children in Europe our prospective study seeks to determine the hospitalisation and outpatient influenza incidence rates in children under 6 years old presenting to the Royal London Hospital UK over two winter seasons 2002/2003 and 2003/2004. Design/Methods: We recruited children under the age of 6 years old in the hospital presenting with acute influenza-like illnesses. A structured electronic questionnaire was administered and nasopharyngeal aspirates were performed and sent for viral immunofluorescence and PCR. Influenza rates were stratified by age and by clinical diagnoses. Influenza incidences were also estimated from a predictive clinical diagnoses models generated from the data collected in the first season i.e. 2002/2003. Results: During the two seasons 977 children were recruited and the influenza A attack rate was 5.9%. Over the two seasons the average influenza A hospitalisation incidence rate was 26.1 per 10,000 person-months whereas the influenza A accident and emergency outpatient rate was 15.4 per 10,000 person-months. The highest age specific influenza hospitalisation incidence rate was in children aged 24-35 months old which was 61 per 10,000 person-months whereas the 6-23 month olds had an age specific influenza hospitalisation incidence rate of 4.6 per 10,000 person-months. The highest age specific influenza AE outpatient incidence rate was in children aged 6-23 months old and was 19.8 per 10,000 person-months whereas the 24-35 months had an age specific influenza AE outpatient incidence rate of 8.45 per 10,000 person-months. An influenza predictive model based on clinical diagnoses parameters was generated from the first season's data and consisted of five variables: upper respiratory infection, tonsillitis, pneumonia and the incidences of otitis media and non specific febrile illnesses under the graph. The estimated influenza incidence rate in all the 4628 eligible children under 6 years old recruited in the first seasons study was 29.1-35.4 per 10,000 person-months. Influenza rates were highest in children presenting with pharyngotonsillitis, febrile seizures and otitis media.",

HMPV is genetically related to avian pneumovirus C but does not replicate in turkeys or chickens. It has been shown to replicate in primates and small animals such as guinea pigs, mice and Syrian golden hamsters. This study was undertaken to evaluate the suitability of BALB/c mice as models for hMPV infection. hMPV is not a natural pathogen of mice. However, we showed that intranasal inoculation of BALB/c mice with hMPV led to a productive infection with significant morbidity. Indeed, hMPV induced overt clinical disease in mice, with a significant weight loss on day 2. Lung viral replication occurred from days 3 to 5. hMPV elicited high levels of IgG-specific antibody response in sera with a strong increase in both IgG1 and IgG2a levels suggesting that hMPV induced a systemic Th1/Th2-like response. This mixed Th1/Th2-like profile is in accordance with the fact that both IFN-gamma (Th1) and IL-4 (Th2) were produced in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Acute infection with hMPV elicited a rapid and sustained pulmonary inflammatory response without eosinophilia. Airway obstruction measured by plethysmography, and airway hyperresponsiveness after metacholine challenge were significantly increased in hMPV-infected mice compared to controls. In summary, we present an animal model that enables the investigation of immunodeterminants of protection and recovery from hMPV infection.",

            "text": "HHV-6 as a causative agent of fulminant hepatic failure in young children Among young children, a rising number of cases of fulminant hepatic failures (FHF) remains of undetermined cause. Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), a betaherpesvirus, is able to infect hepatocytes in vitro, and has been associated with FHF and acute liver injury. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of HHV-6 infection in a group of pediatric patients harbouring various acute liver diseases, in comparison with a control group of children with stable chronic liver diseases. Twenty-three children (median age: 24 months; range: 7-61) with different types of liver injuries underwent liver transplantation: 6 FHF with undetermined cause, three FHF with an etiologic cause (hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection, Wilson disease, autoimmune hepatitis), three acute decompensations of chronic liver diseases (ADCLD), and 11 stable chronic liver diseases (biliary cirrhosis). HHV-6 DNA was detected and quantified in explanted livers and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at the time of tranplantation. Among children with FHF of undetermined cause and ADCLD, HHV-6 DNA was detected in 100% of liver specimens and 50% of PBMC specimens, with HHV-6 median load higher in liver biopsies (1070 copies/10 6 cells) than in PBMCs (29 copies/10 6 cells). These results are in favour of viral replication in hepatic tissue. Conversely, among children with stable chronic liver diseases, only one had HHV-6 positive detection in liver and PBMCs, with low HHV-6 loads (26 and 323 copies/10 6 cells, respectively). HHV-6 was not detected in the patient with HAV hepatitis, and HHV-6 loads were quite low in both liver biopsy and PBMCs (125 and 168 copies/10 6 cells, respectively) from the one with Wilson disease. Of note, HHV-6 loads were high for the patient with autoimuune hepatitis (13,768 and 10,000 copies/10 6 cells, in liver and PBMCs, respectively). All the HHV-6 identified were variant B. Our results suggest that HHV-6 may play a significant role in the occurrence of FHF and ADCLD. Moreover, HHV-6 may act as a triggering factor in the development of autoimmune fulminant hepatitis. Nevertheless, the viral mechanisms of liver injury remain to be elucidated. Results: During studied period 1977 cases of varicella were hospitalized in CR. In 10 selected departments of infectious diseases were hospitalized 1317 (66.6%) patients. Seventy nine percent of patients were children below 18 years of age, 21% were adults. The average duration of hospitalisation was 8.1 days, median duration 7 days. In 147 (11.2%) children were registered with risk factors, 78 patients were on immunosuppressive treatment. Complications were observed in 851 (64.6%) patients: in 282 (21.4%) patients local and in 569 systemic. Systemic complications were observed in 42.4 of children and in 46.4 of adults (RR = 1.18; p = 0.23). There was no significant difference in occurrence of complications between groups with or without risk factors: the occurrence of local complications in the group with risk factors was 29.3% compared with 29.6% in non-risk group (RR = 0.99; p = 0.98). Incidence of systemic complications in risk group was 33.3%. Significantly higher incidence of systemic complications-44.4% was among adult patients (RR = 0.75; p = 0.01). Altogether 569 primary complications were observed-104 cases of encephalitis, 156 cases of liver involvement and in 21 patients was diagnosed atypical pneumonia (average age 26.9 years). One hundred and forty one patients were treated in intensive care units and three patients required reanimation care. The average duration of stay in intensive care unit was 6.0 days (median 5 days). Only 17 patients had a history with risk factors. Five hundred twenty seven patients were treated with aciclovir.",

At this visit the parents receive additional information about vaccines, which their children had not yet obtained. In order to increase vaccination rates a vaccination register in the city of Essen/Germany was established. At the first check of vaccination cards of 6th graders (n = 4 568) only 15% of the students had the complete vaccination set they needed at their age. These low rates led to the implementation of an active vaccination counselling program throughout the city of Essen for these students.

In an additional project videos about Hepatitis B/MMR were shown before the individual counselling. This extended information increased the protection rate for another 15% for MMR to 74% and 40% for Hepatitis B to 80%. A similar vaccination counselling programme was established for kindergarten children. Only 44% of the 3-4 year old children investigated (n = 2909) had a complete vaccination status. After the counselling 88% of the children showed complete vaccination status 3 months later. These results indicate that vaccination counselling of children by the PCYHS may help dramatically to increase the coverage rate of vaccinations. This was achieved by setting up a vaccination register, a one-time individual vaccination counselling and additional information by videos. This increase was only possible by the close cooperation of kindergarten, schools, and the PCYHS. This model of counselling may help to increase coverage of vaccinations in the german population at low costs.",

Also this supports the need for further studies to clarify the real role of Cp chronic infection in restenosis of coronary arteries post PTCA. BK virus infection was prospectively studied during the first year post renal transplantation. Infection was assessed by the detection and quantification of viral DNA in urine and plasma, to determine the frequency and the risk factors for BKv active infection and disease. One hundred four unselected and consecutive patients who underwent renal allograft transplantation in 2002 at Nantes Hospital were enrolled. Urine and plasma samples were collected at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post transplantation and evaluated for viral DNA by a home-made real time PCR. All positive samples were quantified using a plasmid standard curve and NCCR region of 31 BKv urine strains was sequenced. Virological datas were then analysed according to demographic, clinical and biological parameters. A total of 451 blood and 421 urine samples were collected (median of four urine and four plasma per patient). Positive DNAuria and/or DNAemia were observed in 57% and 29% of patients, respectively. We defined three groups of patients: no infection (gr1, 45 pts), positive urines (gr2, 29 pts), positive plasma (gr3, 30 pts). DNAuria became positive within the first 3 months in 80% of patients. Urine viral loads ranged from <3.6 to 11.6 log cop/ml (median 6.4) and were higher in gr3 than in gr2 (p = 0.0008). Positive DNAuria was significantly associated with the use of FK506 as maintenance therapy (OR 3.2, p = 0.05) and cold ischemia duration >24 h (OR 4.6, p = 0.008) and viral loads were significantly higher in patients receiving FK 506 (p = 0.03). Comparison of the 31 NCCR sequences with archetype WW NCCR sequence, found ponctual mutations. They were not associated with any of the parameters analysed. Viral loads in plasma ranged from <3.2 to 7.8 log cop/ml (median 3.7). Positive DNAemia was closely associated to positive DNAuria (RR = 7.8, p < 0.001). Our prospective data highlight the high frequency of active BKv infection after renal transplantation, which is favoured by FK 506 therapy and local ischemia. Despite the observation of high viral load in some of patients, none developed BKv nephropathy. A systematic follow-up of BKv infection is thus not required after renal transplantation.",

According to official statistics of the Infectious Diseases Hospital now we have change of etiology of the purulent meningitis among adults in the Republic of Belarus. The most common agent is Str. pneumonia, causing approximately 50% the purulent meningitis. N. meningitis causes approximately 25% the bacterial meningitis. L. monocytogenes is a very common agent of meningitis in patients over 55 years, who have some chronic diseases, for example diabetic or alcoholism. As a rule, the drug users have the bacterial meningitis, caused by S. aureus. In these cases the meningitis is the first manifestation of the bacterial endocarditis. Rare cases of bacterial meningitis caused by H. influenzae have the particular interest. Nowadays taking into consideration the considerable increase of resistance of Str. pneumoniae to penicillin in countries of Eastern Europe, we use cephalosporins of the third generation as the first line of therapy. The ideal antibiotics for these patients are ceftriaxone or high doses of cefotaxime. As a rule both the immunosuppressive patients and the old patients received the combination of ceftriaxone/cefotaxime plus ampicillin (16-24 g/day). The etiologic therapy of the bacterial meningitis, caused by S. aureus, includes cephalosporins of the third generation or meropenem. Meropenem is used by patients with neutropenia or other immunosuppressive states. We add vancomycin to the first line of therapy only when we suspect hospital-acquired meningitis. When we prescribe antibacterial therapy, we pay attention to the basic pathology, age of patients and initial localization of infection.

For statistical analyses, steatosis was defined as an outcome when its degree was at least mild-to-moderate. In univariate analyses, steatosis was significantly associated with BMI > 25 (p = 0.02), HCV genotype 3 (p = 0.02), the use of NNRTI (p = 0.047), aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.04) and severe histological activity (p = 0.002).

Detection of HCV-RNA in blood serum is used for therapy monitoring of patients with hepatitis C. Despite of HCV-RNA elimination from blood serum during treatment in some patients HCV viremia appears again after completion of therapy. The aim of the study was to assess HCV-RNA in peripheral blood leukocytes of hepatitis C patients in relation to HCV-RNA and antibodies to HCV in the serum. The study involved 40 patients undergoing anti-viral therapy (interferon + ribavirin). RNA isolated from serum and peripheral blood leukocytes (by Qiagen kits for genomic or viral RNA) was examined for the presence of HCV-RNA by RT-PCR technique using specific oligonucleotide primers or by comercially available kits (Amplicor, ROCHE). In order to show possible presence of HCV sequence in peripheral blood leukocytes, molecular DNA probes was constructed with PCR amplicon and biotin labelled by nick translation. HCV sequences was detected by FISH and also on chromatin fibers by extended chromatin fibers in situ hybridization (ECFs-FISH). Twenty two patients out of 40 eliminated HCV-RNA from the serum and 18 remained HCV-positive. In the serum negative group HCV-RNA was detected in mononuclear cells of 10 patients. The presence of HCV-RNA in mononuclear cells was confirmed by FISH technique. In ECFs-FISH procedure no signal was found in all examined patients. Our data suggest that leukocytes infected with HCV can serve as virus reservuare. HCV-RNA serum negative patients after completion of anti-viral therapy having HCV-RNA in their leukocytes would be at greater risk of hepatitis C recurrence. These HCV-RNA serum negative but leukocyte positive patients would be a potential source of spreading HCV infection. This work was supported by KBN grant nr 3PO5E10124.",

To evaluate this particular point in our local population, we analysed retrospectively 89 HPV-16 positive cervical samples obtained from 78 women consulting the gynaecological unit of Nantes university hospital. 20.3% of samples had a normal cytology, whereas the others showed a cervical intraneoplasia grade 1 (20.3%) or grades 2-3 (66.3%). 84 E6 genes and 88 E7 genes were successfully amplified by specific PCR. Variants were analysed by direct nucleotide sequencing and multiple sequence alignments of the full length E6 and E7 gene were performed with Mega program. Phylogenetic trees were constructed. No insertions or deletions in the sequenced fragments were observed. Only 31.3% of the HPV-16 E6/E7 genes were identical to the prototype sequence (T350). The previously described T350G mutation in E6 gene was present in 57.1% of HPV-16. A total of 15 (5 non-published, 10 non-synonymous) and 5 mutations (1 non-published and 2 non-synonymous) were identified in E6 and E7 gene, respectively. Four samples contained multiple nucleotide changes typical of non-European variants. No significant associations were observed between variants and the different cytological classes, but interestingly, the four multiple variant samples were all associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (3 high-grade, 1 low grade). Since the risk of high grade cervical neoplasia seems to increase in patients infected with certain HPV-16 variants, the knowledge of their local prevalence is of interest. Furthermore, the determination of E6/E7 variants may be useful in the perspective of HPV antiviral treatment and vaccine. Background: Neonatal BM have a poor prognosis with a mortality rate of 15-25% and 20-50% significant sequelae. Incidenceand bacterial epidemiology were not known in France.",

No resistant strains were detected in spite of use of local antibiotics Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in young children. Pleural empyema is a rare complication of bacterial pneumonia, associated with a severe morbidity. We recently observed an increase in the incidence of pneumococcal pleural empyema in children admitted at the Necker hospital. The diagnosis of pneumococcal empyema infection, based on the culture of blood or pleural fluid, is frequently negative due to previous administration of antibiotics. Rapid pneumococcal capsular antigen (PAC) detection by latex agglutination has been used for several years, but its diagnostic value is not clearly established. In this work, we evaluated retrospectively the accuracy of PAC in the diagnosis of S. pneumoniae empyema compared to culture in blood and pleural fluid and molecular biology in pleural fluid. We tested for PAC, 55 pleural empyema cases collected over a 4-year period (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) , according to criteria of Light. Microbiological documentation of causal pathogen, by culture or PCR rRNA16S and sequencing, were found in 30 cases including 21 cases with S. pneumoniae. The other bacteria were S. aureus (4) and S. pyogenes (5), all found with a negative PAC in pleural fluid. Among the 21 pneumococcal empyema, PAC were positive in 18 cases providing a sensitivity of 84%. PAC were positive in seven cases, while bacterial cultures of pleural empyema were sterile. In five of these seven cases, the diagnosis of pneumococcal empyema was confirmed by PCR (4) when it was performed, or with positive culture of other clinical sample (1). In two cases, the positive PAC were not confirmed despite a positive microscopic examination in one case. The discrepancy between culture and PAC could be explained, according to clinical history of the patients, by previous administration of antibiotics. PAC detection in pleural fluid is a useful test in diagnosis strategy of pneumococcal empyema in children with a high predictive positive value (94%). The low predictive negative value (77%) does make it impossible to rule out the diagnosis of pneumococcal empyema. Therefore, the detection of PAC provides an additional and rapid response in children with pneumococcal empyema, including those having received previous antibiotic therapy.",

Secretion of the toxin is observed for about 35% of routine isolates whereas the corresponding gene is present in more than 85% of these isolates. We analysed 19 independent isolates both for the presence of the LukE-LukD operon and for the toxin production, and tentatively developed a PCR test that detected a deleterious mutation in given isolates. Furthermore, gene expression was assessed by using a competitive RT-PCR test to verify the role of an inserted sequence in the promoter, and sequences corresponding to the secreted toxins were cloned and expressed in E. coli to assess their biological function compared to a control toxin. On the 19 isolates, only 16 (84%) carried the LukE-LukD operon and 8 (42%) secreted the leucotoxin. The operon sequence of four of the isolates revealed numerous mutations that may affect the protein structure, but the three expression-deficient strains showed the deletion of one basis just after the initiation codon. This deletion made impossible any functional translation, despite corresponding mRNAs were synthesized at levels comparable to the control. Four isolates were estimated to carry this deletion among the 19 studied. When proteins were expressed in E. coli some mutations were identified as able to inactivate the leucotoxin. Taken together, this study evidences the extreme variability of the LukE-LukD operon and the lack of toxin expression/function of the toxin for about half of the isolates even genes are present. This illustrates the discrepancy between gene presence that might be detected by genotyping tests and the effective production of a functional toxin. Thus, phenotyping methods remains indicated for the detection of such a leucotoxin to avoid false-positive data, and previous clinical associations remain significant.",

Although resistance to methicillin used to be an exclusivity restrained to hospitals for years, a worldwide emergence of communityacquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus(CAMRSA) clones has been noticed. The inter-human skin-to-skin transmission is the postulated cause of the rapid epidemic spreading of these clones. CAMRSA strains have three common characteristics: a type IV SCCmec cassette (staphylococcal cassette chromosome), a type 3 agrallele (accessory gene regulator) and a phage (phiSLT) carrying the Panton Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene. The combination of these elements appears to provide to the strains a selective advantage with an increased epidemic potential. We hypothesized that the insertion of the phage phiSLT is a determinant of dysregulation in the staphylococcal proteome, by modulation of the expression of protein A, one of the major surface protein of S. aureus. We analysed the expression of protein A in eleven isogenic couples of S. aureus strains before and after transduction of the phiSLT phage. Each strain had been inactivated for a major regulation system of the virulence of S. aureus: two upregulating systems Rot and SarS, and three downregulating systems SarA, Agr and ArlRS. The expression of protein A was analysed by Northern and Western blots. We observed that the acquisition of phage phiSLT induced an overexpression of protein A in several isogenic strains, notably in rot and arl-insertion mutants. The up-regulation of protein A was more prominent at the protein level rather than at the transcriptional level. These results confirm that the presence of phiSLT not only brings a major cytolytic toxin (i.e. the PVL) but also induces an over-expression of protein A and potentially of other virulence factors, that may enhance the colonizing and/or invasing capacities of S. aureus. Twelve isolates were cutaneous samples, and the others were taken from urinary site (n = 2), pulmonary site (n = 3) or blood culture (n = 1). The patients were hospitalised in different departments (8 in medicine, 6 in surgery, 4 in intensive care, 2 in long term care units and 1 in emergency unit). Three patients were transferred from another hospital, the other were coming from home (n = 13) or long term care units (n = 3). Their mean age was 54.9 years (4 d to 95 years), sex ratio: 0.69. Half of them had an history of previous hospitalisation in the last 18 months. 7/11 patients had received broad-spectrum antiobiotics (4 (-lactam-(-lactamase combination and 3 other (-lactam antibiotics) before MRSA isolation. 15/22 MRSA-s were hospital-acquired colonisations or infections (mean time of acquisition: 23.2 d), 7 others were community-acquired.

Rapid identification of MRSA in clinical specimens is important both for antibiotic prophylaxis and isolation of colonized patients. Currently, screening patients for MRSA using culture methods requires 1-3 days for detection and identification. We developed a duplex real-time PCR, targeting the mecA (specific of methicillin resistance) and nuc (specific of S. aureus) genes, without previous isolation and enrichment. We compare the results of this method with those of conventional culture in a group of surgical patients with high risk of MRSA carriage for which vancomycin prophylaxis is usually recommended.",

R&D, Pharmaceutica, Worcester, UK Evolution of bacterial cell walls that resist the action of beta-lactam antibiotics, continues to pose unique challenges to the treatment of infection. An emerging technology of 'bacterial transforming agents (BTA) identifies molecules that reverse cell wall resistance primarily to beta-lactams and related agents, by therapeutically targeting moieties involved in the binding of muropeptide tails to cell wall cross-links. Moieties that mimic those in the pentaglycine cross-links of S. aureus, including methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains, can result in peptidoglycan muropeptides terminating with a d-Ala-X, instead of d-Ala-d-Ala. BTAs similarly interact with muropeptide tail-cross-links assemblies to hypersensitise the cell wall, transforming MRSA into MSSA, without eliminating PBP2. As a basic test of the technology in vitro, a glycine benzyl ester at 0.2% ww/v, reduced the MICs of 20 MRSA (including UK Epidemic MRSAs-1, 15, 16 and 17) from >256 mg/l to 2-4 mg/l. Other BTAs increase potency by 10-100 times, such that their co-formulation with betalactamase-resistant anti-staphylococcal beta-lactams or related antimicrobial for topical treatment becomes immediately possible. In addition, MICs of vancomycin for MRSA with reduced glycopeptide-sensitivity, were reduced from 4.0 to <0.5 mg/l. There is also some activity against vancomycinresistant Enterococcus faecium. None of these substances have antimicrobial activity in their own right and MRSA are only transformed into MSSA in the presence of a BTA. A specific agent with established pharmaco-kinetics and toxicity data, that reduces MICs of methicillin from >256 to >4.0 mg/l, in the presence of serum, is a 'bench-mark' coformulant with antimicrobials such as flucloxacillin and cloxacillin for in vivo study.",

Furthermore, between January 2003 and september 2004, a systematic comparison of all the Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated in the hospital was conduced by a molecular typing method in order to access an eventual transmission. Sixty two strains were compared by spoligotyping according to Kamerbeek et al. Spoligotyping is a typing method based on DNA polymorphism present at one particular chromosomal locus, the \"direct repeat\" (DR), which is only present in M.tuberculosis complex bacteria. The number of DR elements in the cluster can vary between strains of the species. These 36 bp DRs are interspersed by non-repetitive DNA spacers of 36-41 bp. Forty three spacers representative of the M. tuberculosis complex strains are synthesized as oligonucleotides and immobilized on a nylon membrane. Isolates are strain-typed on the basis of detecting the presence, or the absence, of specific spacers using PCR and a reverse-line hybridization technique. The nursing auxiliary'strain clearly showed a distinct spoligotype from the others investigated strains. Interestingly, this spoligotype was unique in the spoligotype database of the Centre de R\u00e9f\u00e9rence des Mycobact\u00e9ries de l'Institut Pasteur. In this large epidemiological survey of a suspected nosocomial case of tuberculosis, spoligotyping appeared as an interesting, easy to perform and rapid method of molecular typing. It allowed to demonstrate that the nursing auxiliary tuberculosis was unrelated to the others cases of tuberculosis diagnosed in the hospital during this period. However this investigation is actually prolonged for a recommended period of 18 months. Introduction: Despite a widespread perception that the epidemiology of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in Athens has changed recently, in part due to the influx of immigrants during the past 15 years, this has not been investigated properly. Our aim was therefore to conduct an epidemiological survey collecting relevant data from patients diagnosed at the two largest Pulmonary Hospitals of the city.",

The LD50 s of the strains were measured in a day old chicken model, inoculated with several doses (3-9 log 10 cfu) per os, at 7 days post-inoculation. The colonisation levels were assessed at the sublethal dose 7 days post-inoculation by determining the number of CFU of Salmonella in the faeces, caeca, spleen, and liver. In the case of the acrB mutants, the MIC values of SDS, sodium deoxycholate (DOC) and CHOL decreased 64-128-fold, 2-8-fold and not significantly, respectively, relative to those of the wild type strains. For the tolC mutants, MICs of SDS, DOC and CHOL decreased 1024-2048-fold, 512-fold, and 256-fold, respectively. Thus, the decrease in resistance levels to SDS and bile salts was much more important for the tolC than for the acrB mutants. CHOL did not affect the in vitro growth of the wild-type strains or the acrB mutants but inhibited that of the tolC mutants. The LD50s were 6 log 10 and 7 log 10 cfu for one wild type DT104 strain and the acrB mutant, respectively, and were not calculable for the tolC mutants or the DT204 strains because of a too small number of dead chicks. In contrast to the acrB mutants, the tolC mutants were unable to colonise the organs, and were not detected in the faeces of most chicks. The colonisation levels of the acrB mutants were the same as those of the wild-type strains. Thus, TolC but not AcrB appears to be essential for multidrug-resistant S. Typhimurium DT104 and DT204 colonisation of chicks, which correlate well with their respective roles in resistance to detergents and bile salts. TolC could therefore be a better target than AcrB for the development of efflux system inhibitors.",

UR086 BioAgresseurs, Sant\u00e9, Environnement, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Tours-Nouzilly, France Campylobacter, one of the leading cause of human gastroenteritis, is reported worldwide to be increasingly resistant to antibiotics. Apart from target mutations, an efflux mechanism (CmeABC efflux system) has been described. By sequencing the whole operon of a resistant strain, we found that, in contrast to CmeA and CmeC, the CmeB sequence greatly differs (22%) from that of the NCTC 11168 strain. The objectives of this work were to design a PCR-RFLP method to study the diversity of this multidrug transporter in several representative strains of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli (isolated from human, poultry or pig) and to examine its utility as a typing method. Twenty-three strains were included in the analysis. The entire cmeB gene was amplified by PCR and digested by eight restriction enzymes. A comparison of the restriction patterns was made to determine the diversity of the transporter sequence (at the nucleotide and protein levels). Eighteen different overall patterns were obtained. The same discrimination could be obtained by associating only half of the enzymes. A single HinfI-HaeII digestion was sufficient to discriminate two-third of the strains. Three pairs of identical patterns (including one human and one poultry grouping together) were observed. Overall, the strains showed 79-97% of homology except one poultry strain with less than 30% of homology. Differences were localized all over the sequence and also concern the characteristic functional motifs of the transporter. Of the twenty-eight potential restriction sites, two and five were respectively conserved in all or all except one of the strains. In conclusion, in contrast to its Salmonella and Escherichia coli AcrB homolog, a high diversity was observed in the cmeB multidrug transporter gene of both Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. This could be of importance in targeting this pump to combat resistance. Furthermore, the PCR-RFLP designed in this work could be a cheap and easy-to-perform method to compare isolates of these bacterial species. In addition, protein modifications that could have a functional significance (in the characteristic motifs involved in substrate recognition and energizing) were also observed.",

Among currently available EPIs, benzimidazole derivatives such as omeprazole are safely used since years as inhibitors of the eukaryotic proton pump in the treatment of gastric ulcers, but exhibit a moderate activity against bacteria. In this study, a series of new potential inhibitors was synthesized, based on some common features shared by different EPIs. In this series, five molecules (1a-1e), showing structural analogies with the benzimidazole proton pump inhibitors, were examined. Then, published methods investigating the bacterial efflux systems and their inhibition were tested, in order to delineate a strategy for EPI evaluation, using the following model: Staphylococcus aureus strain SA 1199B, overexpressing the MDR efflux pump NorA, as germ-test; norfloxacin as preferential substrate; and omeprazole as reference EPI. Antibiograms by the diffusion method in agar supplemented with the EPI at MIC/4, subsequent checkerboard assays combining the antibiotic and the EPIs, and finally HPLC measurements of antibiotic intracellular accumulation with or without EPIs were found to be a useful approach. Products 1a-1d appeared to be efficient by the diffusion test and the checkerboard technique ( FIC = 0.25, for optimal concentrations of 8 mg/l of norfloxacin and 64 mg/l of EPI). At these concentrations; the most promising molecule 1c increased the intracellular level of norfloxacin from 3 to 8 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ng/10 \u22126 cells; compound 1e gave poorer results. In comparison, omeprazole yieded to a FIC = 0.25, and increased the norfloxacin intracellular accumulation up to 12 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ng/10 \u22126 cells. Thus, our products actually acted as EPIs on the MDR efflux pump NorA, but further research is needed to obtain drugs more effective than omeprazole. However, our data allowed structure-activity relationship analysis that will help us to modify the design of our synthesis and throw some light on the mechanism of action of these inhibitors on bacterial efflux pumps.",

From October to December 2003, 10 French private laboratories consecutively collected 420 clinical strains with medical informations from an interview with the patient: fever, pregnancy, associated diseases, history of urinary-tract abnormalities, re-infection (3 months), previous antibiotic treatment or hospitalization (6 months). Escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen (80%) followed by Proteus mirabilis (4%), Klebsiella spp. (2%), other Enterobacteriaceae (4%), Enterococcus spp. (3%), Staphylococcus aureus (2%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (2%). S. aureus was more often isolated in diabetic's patients. Susceptibility to antibiotics was studied for E. coli using determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations by the agar dilution method in a coordinating center. Results were interpreted according to the recommendations of the Comit\u00e9 de l'Antibiogramme de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Microbiologie. The susceptiblity was 61% for amoxicillin (AMX), 93% for nalidixic acid (NAL), 97% for norfloxacin (NOR) and ciprofloxacin (CIP), 77% for cotrimoxazole (SXT), 99% for fosfomycin, gentamicin and cefotaxime. The susceptibility of E. coli was lower in case of previous treatment with \u2424-lactam antibiotics for AMX (84% versus 95%, p = 0.02) et SXT (62% versus 81%, p = 0.02). In the same way, previous treatment with quinolones was associated with decreased susceptibility for NAL (84% versus 95%, p = 0.02) and SXT (62% versus 81%, p = 0.02). For the treatment of these urinary tract infections, fluoroquinolones represented 53% of the prescribed antibiotics, followed by \u2424-lactam antibiotics (24%), fosfomycin (14%), cotrimoxazole (4%), furanes (4%) and nalidixic acid (1%). Single-dose treatment, three days and seven days or more treatments were respectively prescribed in 16, 12 and 73% of the cases. Urinary tract infections (UTI) acquired in the community, seldom complicated, are very frequent and require an empiric treatment protocol based in the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern to etiologic agents. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli are the more frequent bacteria causing UTI and a marker for to predict the evolution of resistance in the community. We have studied the isolation of E. coli and your antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in our area during the last 5 years. We identified 4685 strains from urine samples with significant counts using conventional methods and broth dilution for to establish MIC from several antimicrobials (Microscan, Dade Behring). We have evaluated the sensitivity to ampicillin (AM), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AC), nalidixic acid ( (75.1-73.9 ). Strains with decreased sensitivity to CIP (1\u00ecgr/ml) are more frequent now (2.1% versus 1.3% in 2000). Also, is relevant the proportion of strains with MIC of 0.5\u00ecgr/ml (10.8%). One thousand and ten strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones (23.6%). In this group the percentages of sensitivity to other antimicrobials were substantially lesser: 16.3 (AM), 63.3 (AC), 39.2 (TMP/SXT), 90.1 (FOS), 74.9 (FD) and 75.1 (GM), presenting cross-resistance in several strains. As conclusions is remarked the recovery in susceptibility of some antimicrobials recommended in ambulatory therapy, perhaps due to an antimicrobial policy established from few years in the community healthcare. Nevertheless is disturbing the constant increased in the resistance of quinolones group, according to uncontrolled and inappropriate use due to the good image of activity and tolerability.",

Objective: Greece is a country of intermediate and low endemicity of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, respectively. A downward trend for HBV infection has been noted during the last years contrasting to the very high infection rates among immigrants, however, recent epidemiology data on these infections are lacking. The \"Attikon\" is a new University hospital located in western Attica, an area with low socio-economic status inhabitants and many immigrants. Our purpose is to determine the epidemiology of HBV and HCV infections among patients presenting to this hospital and present here our preliminary findings.",

Such a high prevalence, which is more than two times the one estimated in the general population is puzzling and deserves further investigations. In this population, 110 clinical and epidemiological data were obtained. No relation has been observed between region of Mali patients come from and HBV infection prevalence. Of these students, 92 gave a written agreement for HIV serology. In this selected cohort, the HIV seropositivity was 9% while the overall prevalence in Mali is of 1.7%. The high prevalence of these two infections in a population of student who live promiscuously on the campus of the Faculty of Medicine (Point G, Bamako) isolated from the city, suggest a sexual transmission.",

Such a hypothesis has been confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. This study confirms the high prevalence of genotype E in Sub-Saharan Western Africa (M.

Diagnosis was difficult owing to the non-specific presentation: cough in 70%, fever in 46%, other respiratory, in 18%, or digestive symptoms, in 7%. Thirty-six percent patients had lymphopenia, 10%, thrombopenia, and 8% increased transaminases levels. Because of isolation, chest X-ray was done at bedside in 86 patients, and showed abnormalities in 17%. All patients with pneumopathy were given amoxicillin and roxithromycin. In the absence of confirmed SARS, alternative diagnoses were looked for in order to exclude its suspicion, allowing to stop the isolation, and introduce appropriate treatment. An alternative diagnosis was recognized in 17 (19%) patients. A variety of community acquired diseases was identified in 16 patients, by isolation of the causative organism from nasopharyngeal/respiratory secretions: metapneumovirus infection, n = 1, influenza A or B, n = 4, pneumococcal pneumonia, n = 4, tuberculosis, n = 1, by blood or urine cultures: infective endocarditis, n = 1, pyelonephritis, n = 1, Salmonella sp. enterocolitis, n = 1, or by other diagnostic means: Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumopathy, n = 1, (serology), maxillary sinusitis, n = 1. An Asian acquired-infection was diagnosed in one patient: Burkholderia pseudomallei, n = 1. No SARS coronavirus was isolated. All pts were cured. The initial evaluation of each patient, performed concomitantly by clinicians and epidemiologists, was discordant in 35 (39%) pts on epidemiological data (n = 24) or clinico-biological data (n = 11). At the final evaluation all pts were considered as \"excluded\" cases for epidemiologists, while 47 (54%) were considered as \"possible\" or \"doubtful\" cases for clinicians. Whether these cases were a minor form of coronavirus infection, with spontaneous healing, remains hypothetical. Improvement of virological methods to isolate and identify both coronaviruses and other potential respiratory infections-associated viruses, in combination with serological tests, would be useful to assess this hypothesis retrospectively in these patients, and in case of a new outbreak. The occurrence of influenza infections during hospital stay is responsible for severe consequences in immunocompromised and debilitated patients. The virus can be introduced in the medical setting by patients, visitors and health care workers (HCWs). The best way to prevent the diffusion of influenza virus by HCWs is to recommend their annual vaccination. However, the vaccine coverage of HCWs against influenza is weak. The aim of this study was to evaluate the perception of influenza vaccination by HCWs and their knowledge of the risks linked to influenza in hospitals. A self-administered questionnaire including 24 short items was proposed to the HCWs of two French University Hospitals (H\u00f4pital Edouard Herriot in Lyons and CHU de Saint-Etienne) by the hygiene referent nurses of each ward, by the Departments of Occupational Medicine and by electronic mail. From a total of 7973 questionnaires that were distributed, 2763 responses (34.6%) were obtained from HCW: 72.0% from care-giving personnel, 12.2% from medical personnel and 15.4% from other personnel without contact with patients. The mean age of the responders was 37.8 years. The overall vaccine coverage against influenza was 26.9%, with significant differences between the three HCW categories: 21.0% for care-giving personnel, 57.7% for medical personnel and 29.1% for other personnel (p < 0.001). The main reason for HCWs to get vaccinated was their own protection (24.5%) whereas the protection of patients was mentioned by only 17.5% of them. The fact that the vaccination was not mandatory was the first reason to refuse it (33.2%) whereas the fear of vaccine adverse effects was mentioned by only 17.0% of the non vaccinated HCWs. Except for the medical personnel, the knowledge regarding influenza, its consequences in hospitals and its prevention was weak. A total of 41% of the responders mentioned that influenza is not a nosocomial infection suggesting that they ignore that non-vaccinated persons are at risk to transmit the virus within the hospital. This study highlights that important efforts are required to provide information on the nosocomial transmission of influenza and to promote vaccination among HCWs, especially nurses, in order to reduce the risk of influenza outbreak in health care facilities.",

B. bronchiseptica causes chronic respiratory infections in a wide range of animals but is rarely implicated as a human pathogen. B. parapertussis may cause a milder form of whooping cough. The complete genome sequences of B. bronchiseptica RB50 (5.3 Mb), and B. parapertussis 12,822 (4.7 Mb) have been published recently. In-silico analysis of these sequences identified the same open reading frame (orf) that shared 57% nucleotide identity with that of an Ambler class A \u2424-lactamase gene of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Cloning experiments of the corresponding gene, bla BBR\u22121 , of B. bronchiseptica CIP102314 (reference strain) gave recombinant clones expressing a clavulanic-acid inhibited class A \u2424-lactamase, BBR-1, with a pI value of 5.6 and a relative molecular mass of ca. 32 kDa. We sequenced also the gene bla BBR\u22121 of two clinical strains of B. bronchiseptica and of a reference strain of B. parapertussis CIP 63.33. In all cases, a same bla BBR\u22121 gene was found. BBR-1 shared 42 to 52% amino acid identity with the most closely related enzymes, the chromosomally encoded enzymes from Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. B. parapertussis was susceptible to all \u2424-lactams except to cefoxitin whereas B. bronchiseptica was susceptible to amino-, carboxy-, ureidopenicillins, cephalothin and carbapenems but resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins, whereas reference strains of both species hydrolyze nitrocefin. Once cloned, the substrate profile of the non-inducible BBR-1 was that of a clavulanic-acid inhibited narrow-spectrum penicillinase. The \u2424-lactamase BBR-1 hydrolyzed significantly benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, at a lower level cephalothin whereas no activity was detectable against broad-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems. The study indicated that B. bronchiseptica and B. parapertussis harbor an identical and naturally-occurring Ambler class A penicillinase that may not contribute significantly to naturally-occurring resistance phenotype, at least in the case of B. parapertussis.",

The horizontal transfer of one plasmid carrying bla DHA-1 could be shown for seven of these strains. The aim of this study was to compare the genetic organization of bla DHA-1 in these eleven strains. By analogy with previous results obtained for K. pneumoniae Kp760 and Salmonella enteritidis KF92, both producing plasmid-mediated DHA-1 enzyme, primers were designed for genome walking by PCR mapping. When this methodology failed, either resistance to cefoxitin was cloned in pBKCMV, or GenomeWalker TM DNA walking was used for finding unknown DNA sequences adjacent to bla DHA\u22121 . For all strains of Klebsiella spp., the region mobilized from Morganella morganii including ampC and ampR genes was inserted upstream to second copy of 3 -Conserved Segment (3 -CS) of a complex sulI-type integron, like In6/In7. For three strains, the M. morganii region of variable length was inserted in a complex sulI-type integron; each of them had a different cassette genes profile. For one strain, the M. morganii region lay straight downstream to the common region (CR), like it was previously described for Kp760 or KF92. The CR includes an orf513 presumably coding for a recombinase involved in the mobilization of resistance genes. For two strains, between the CR and the M. morganii region, was inserted an additional 10 kb fragment, partially identical to sap (ABC transporter) and psp (phage shock protein) operon from Salmonella typhimurium LT2. The genetic organization of bla DHA was identical for the other eight strains, seven of them harboring the same plasmid. Surprisingly, despite the presence of a truncated 3 -CS adjacent to ampR, no integron element was found, neither int gene, nor orf513. Nevertheless, upstream to the M. morganii region lay a part of the fragment identical to S. typhimurium LT2 including the psp operon. The emergence of acquired DHA-1 Klebsiella spp. in the Paris area was partially due to horizontal spread of one plasmid. bla DHA seems to have been mobilized from M. morganii by several independent recombination events, most often in complex sulI-type integrons including a putative recombinase.",

However, most of the collected data were obtained from B subtype isolates, and only few publications are available concerning RT gene mutations in non-B subtypes. We have collected and analyzed the HIV-1 RT sequences of 49 naive patients (22 B and 27 non-B subtypes), and 638 treated patients (457 [71.6%] B and 181 [28.4%] non-B subtypes). On one hand, the sequences were interpreted according to Stanford \"virtual phenotype algorithm\". On the other hand, they were aligned and statistically analyzed in order to detect eventual subtype-related differences between RT sequence profiles. In the naive group of patients, 8/22 B subtype isolates displayed anti-RT resistance mutations. Two of these isolates presented mutations associated with resistance to AZT, 3TC, d4T, EFV and NVP, three to AZT, 3TC, and d4T, and one to 3TC. One isolate displayed the mutation M41L and another Y115F. Only 1/27 non-B subtype isolate displayed anti-RT resistance mutations (K70R, and Y115F). Moreover, a significant difference in the amino-acid substitutions was found between B and non-B subtype isolates at 4 positions including 184, 210, and 215 which are associated to drug-resistance. In the treated group, the Stanford virtual phenotype algorithm indicated a higher prevalence of anti-RT resistance in B as compared to non-B subtype isolates (59.6% versus 50.4%). Amino acid substitution analysis in the RT sequence evidenced a significant difference between B and non-B subtype isolates in 30 positions including six drug-resistance associated sites (41, 44, 67, 74, 115, and 210 ) even though the treatment regimen was similar in both B and non-B infected patients. Our results indicate that the amino-acid profile of B and non-B subtype isolates is different, either because of their natural polymorphism or as a result of treatment history. The high prevalence of resistance mutations in na\u00efve B subtype isolates should encourage the systematic RT gene sequencing, in order to adapt treatment strategy to the virus. Our results suggest that treatment algorithms based on B subtype cohort studies may need modifications to be applied to non-B subtype isolates. Efforts should be considered to study each subtype independently.",

Patients were checked for ESBL producing strains upon admission, 72 h later and at weekly intervals over a 3 months period. Other participants were checked once. ESBL producing strains were detected by antimicrobial susceptibility testings and were then identified by the API 20E system. The type of ESBLs produced was detected by PCR analysis of bla genes, DNA sequencing and isoelectric focusing experiments. The genome of ESBL producing strains was analysed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A total of 123 strains collected from 65 patients, two health workers and 10 healthy subjects were ESBL producing strains.

PCR was performed in 13 out of 21 of those strains, to detect mecA gene. Cefoxitin disk was in concordance with PCR for all isolates.Conclusions: Cefoxitin disk 30 mcg in 35 \u2022 C as a routine, cheap, easily applicable method could be promising in the detection of methicillin resistant CNS to be used alternatively to MIC test.

Methods: Prospective observational cohort study in a 30-bed ICU, during a 15-month period. All immunocompetent patients hospitalized for >48 h, who did not receive antibiotics before ICU admission, were eligible. Routine screening of MRB (methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA], ceftazidime or imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa [PA], A. baumannii [AB], extendingspectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli [ESBL], and S. maltophilia [SM]) was performed on ICU admission and weekly. MRB duplicates wee excluded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine risk factors for MRB emergence in the ICU. In addition, a casecontrol study was performed to determine whether FQ use is associated with subsequent emergence of MRB. Matching (1:1) criteria included: length of ICU stay (controls \u00a1\u00dd cases), number of antibiotics \u00a1\u00c0 1, SAPS II \u00a1\u00c0 7, age \u00a1\u00c0 5 years, and admission category. Results: 239 patients were included, 108 MRB were isolated in 77 patients. Older age; diabetes history; mechanical ventilation; FQ use; longer duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, antibiotic treatment, FQ use, and large spectrum penicillin use were associated (p < .05) with subsequent emergence of MRB in univariate analysis. FQ use and longer duration of antibiotic treatment were identified as independent risk factors for MRB occurrence (OR [95% CI] = 3.3 [1.7-6.5], 1.1 [1.0-1.2] per day, p < .001, respectively). 135 (56%) patients received FQ, matching was successful for 72 (53%) of them. Number of MRB (40 versus 15/1000 ICU-days, p = .019) and percentage of patients with MRB (40% versus 22%, OR [95% CI] = 1.5 [1.0-2.4], p = .028) were significantly higher in cases than in controls. Although MRSA (26% versus 12%, OR [95% CI] = 1.6 [.6-2.9], p = .028) and ESBL (11% versus 1%, OR [95%CI] = 4.7 [0.7-30.2], p = .017) rates were higher in cases than in controls; PA (15% versus 8%), AB (1% versus 5%), and SM (2% versus 1%) rates were similar (p > .05) in case and control patients. Conclusion: Restricting FQ use and limiting antibiotic treatment duration could be suggested to decrease MRB spread in the ICU. 157/37O Risk factors for Staphylococcus aureus infection in liver transplant recipients Bert F d , Bellier C c , Lassel L e , Lefranc V c , Durand F b , Belghiti J a , Mentr\u00e9 F e , Fantin B c . a Chirurgie digestive, France, b H\u00e9patologie, France, c M\u00e9decine interne, France, d Microbiologie, France, Hopital Beaujon, Clichy, France, e Biostatistique, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France",

            "text": ": Of the 323 patients, 64 (19.8%) carried methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and 19 (5.6%) carried MRSA. Overall, 63 (19.5%) patients developed S. aureus infection (36 MRSA, 27 MSSA) within 1 month after LT. Variables significantly associated with infection in the univariate analysis (p < 0.05) were: MRSA and MSSA nasal carriage, alcoholic cirrhosis, absence of hepatocellular carcinoma, presence of ascites and decreased prothrombin rate. In the multivariate analysis, MRSA carriage (OR 28.2, p < 0.0001), MSSA carriage (OR 3.4, p = 0.0004), alcoholic cirrhosis (OR 2.3, p = 0.01) and decreased prothrombin rate (OR 1.2, p = 0.01) were independent predictors of infection. Fifteen of the 19 MRSA carriers developed MRSA infection, and the infecting isolate was similar to the nasal isolate in 13 cases according to PFGE typing. Twenty MSSA carriers were infected by S. aureus, including 18 MSSA and 2 MRSA.Conclusions: MRSA and MSSA preoperative nasal carriage are independent risk factors for S. aureus infection in LT recipients, and the infection is most often of endogenous origin. Alcohol consumption and the severity of liver failure, as reflected by the prothrombin rate, are also independently associated with a high risk of infection.MRSA at an English children's hospital from 1998 to 2003Adedeji A, Gray JW. Department of Microbiology, Birmingham Children's Hospital (BCH), Birmingham, UK Recent reports point to MRSA emerging as an increasingly important pathogen in children. At BCH a database of all children with MRSA is maintained. Data on the 385 children first identified as colonised or infected with MRSA between January 1998 and December 2003 were analysed to investigate epidemiological and clinical aspects of MRSA in our hospital. The number of new cases of MRSA declined year on year, from 72 in 1998 to 52 in 2003. 267 (69.4%) and 118 (30.6%) were respectively inpatients and out-patients at the time when MRSA was first detected; 240 (62.3%) children were male. 178 (66.7%) in-patients were aged <2 years, compared with 36 (30.5%) out-patients. Cardiothoracic (90 cases) and paediatric/neonatal surgery (69 cases) accounted for 59.6% of in-patients with MRSA, whereas dermatology (39 cases) and A&E",

The mean age of children with + RSV test is 49.9 days versus 52.4 days (NS). The occurrence of bronchiolitis was 31.6% of all cases, 73% for patients with +RSV test, 27% for the \u2212RSV test patients (p < 0.0001). The negative predictive value of RSV test for occurrence of bronchiolitis was 86% [CI 95: 76-92%], positive predictive value 59% [CI 95: 44-72%]. The mean duration of evolution to bronchiolitis was 44 h (+test) vs 35 h (\u2212test) (NS). Hospitalizations was required for 25% of patients; 79% of those with +RSV test, 21% of \u2212RSV test patients (p < 0.0001). Mean age of hospitalized infants was 42 days versus 55 days for non hospitalized (p = 0.02). The negative predictive value of RSV test for hospitalisations was 91% [CI 95: 82-96%], positive value 50% [CI 95: 37-62%]. Conclusion: Early identification of RSV-infected children under 3 months of age suffering from acute viral rhinitis is important to promptly institute appropriate precautions and surveillance.

Documentation and validation of events before analysis is less standardized in the context of observational epidemiological studies than of clinical trials. We describe the experience of events validation in the APROCO cohort which enrolled 1281 consecutive HIV infected patients in 1997-1999. All clinical and laboratory serious and severe adverse events (SAE) or AIDS-related events (ARE) were prospectively recorded with all available documentation at each clinical center. The following characteristics of each event were described in a standardized questionnaire: diagnosis, evolution and outcome, onset and ending dates, as well as any treatment modification. Exhaustiveness and quality of the records was expected because of monitoring visits in the clinical centers. SAE were defined as death, event threatening vital prognosis, requiring hospitalization or an extension of hospitalization, laboratory or clinical grade 3 or grade 4 events. SAE and ARE with completed information were validated by an Events Validation Committee (EVC) composed of eight clinical experts on HIV infection. All SAE and ARE were independently scored by two experts of the EVC to assess the severity of event using the standardized definition of ANRS and the relation to ART using EMEA recommendations. The ARE were validated using WHO definitions. From May 1997 to June 2004, 1178 SAE (incidence density: 19.2% person-year), 118 deaths and 188 ARE were reported and",

A genotypic comparison of the strains was achieved by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing was performed with a detection of the beta-lactamase activity by an iodine starch procedure. For cloning experiments total DNA was extracted, partially digested by Sau3AI and ligated into pK18-BamHI digested. The ligation product was introduced in E. coli DH5\u00e0 and the transformants were selected on kanamycin (20 mg/l) and ticarcillin (30 mg/l).Results: The six strains were clonally related. The bla PER-3 (pI about 5.4) was cloned on a 2.7 kb fragment. PER-3 differed from PER-1 by the following amino acid substitution: H129 to L129. bla PER-3 was located on a complex orf513-bearing integron as already described for some betalactamases.Conclusion: This report is the first description of an ESBL belonging to the PER family in A. caviae and confirm the spread of members of this family among different species.",
