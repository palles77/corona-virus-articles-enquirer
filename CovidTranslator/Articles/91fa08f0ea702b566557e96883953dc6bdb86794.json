            "text": "The news of a vaccine shortage and rampant bird flu came on the heels of an annual epidemic in 2003-2004 that was moderately severe, especially among children. It began earlier than usual (October) and continued into January 2004, with widespread disease occurring in 45 states. To deal with the volume of queries and issues that arose, the CDC activated its Emergency Operating Center and reassigned staff on a 24-hour, 7-day-perweek basis. The CDC prospectively monitored mortality rates in U.S. children for the first time during this outbreak, and 152 deaths among U.S. residents <18 years of age were attributed to influenza and its known complications (particularly secondary bacterial infections). 10 Additionally, 50 children met the case definition for influenza-related encephalopathy (altered mental status lasting >1 day with onset of neurologic symptoms within 5 days of fever onset), with more than 40% having severe outcomes (death or neurologic sequelae). 11 Influenza A viruses accounted for 99.0% of cases in the United States in 2003-2004. H3N2 strains accounted for 99.9% of the influenza A viruses, and 89% of these were antigenically similar to the drift variant A/Fujian/411/2002. Compared with the A/Panama/2007/99 H3N2 strain (which accounted for 11% of influenza cases) that was included in the 2003-2004 vaccine, A/Fujian has 13 amino acid changes involving several antigenic sites. 10, 12 Although early reports raised concerns that the 2003-2004 vaccine provided minimal, if any, effectiveness against the predominant A/Fujian strain, there was some protection: vaccine efficacy was estimated to be 25% and 49%, respectively, in 2 analyses among children, and 38% and 52%, respectively, among adults with and without an underlying high-risk condition in a case-control study. 13 The CDC conducted a convenience survey of 221 hospitals throughout the U.S. and found that the following types of shortages occurred during the 2003-2004 influenza season: (1) 40% had inadequate vaccine supply, (2) 58% ran out of diagnostic influenza test kits, (3) 28% and 43% had too few general inpatient and intensive care beds, respectively, (4) 35% had insufficient numbers of health care workers (HCWs), and (5) 9% needed to divert patients because of bed or HCW shortages. 14 This survey did not ask about shortages of antiinfluenza drugs or hospital supplies (eg, masks), but these types of shortages occurred at our hospital, as well as other health care centers.",

Communities also are urged to develop real-time tracking of the number of available intensive care unit beds and medical beds for adults and children. Health care systems are encouraged to offer or expand hospital-sponsored sick care services for children of hospital staff to reduce absenteeism during pandemic conditions. 25 The planning for specific needs of children currently is largely left to the local level. The CDC has developed 2 simple computer software modules for use as planning tools at local levels: FluAid 2.0 and FluSurge. FluAid uses population estimates for 0-18 years, 19-64 years, and 651 years along with estimates of the percentage of high-risk patients in each age group and estimates of expected death, hospitalization, outpatient visit, and attack rates to estimate impact of influenza on a local health care system. 26 FluSurge uses population estimates for 0-17 years, 18-64 years, and 651 years along with the number of staffed hospital beds, staffed ICU beds, and number of ventilators available to estimate total hospital demand and total deaths for specified attack rates and duration in weeks of the pandemic period. 27 These tools are works in progress but likely need to be refined at least in terms of the pediatric age ranges used (e.g., <2 yrs, 2-5 years, 5-12 yrs, and 13-18 years).",

Initial state-level plans likely will mirror this and the N-PIPP, often as a matter of practicality. Indeed, the only references to children in the otherwise detailed North Carolina Pandemic Influenza Response Plan of the Division of Public Health of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, released in October 2004, were those referring to determination of projections of case numbers (using FluAid 2.0) and need for hospital beds and ventilators (using FluSurge). 28 Lastly, the medical literature also provides little guidance on influenza pandemic planning efforts for children. The results of a PubMed search are listed in Table II . Only 3 English-language articles published since 1990 have any information relevant to pandemic planning efforts for children. Two provide information about potential attack rates of among various age groups, 29, 30 and one modeled effectiveness of antiviral agents by age groups. 31 The above issues are in addition to the need for (1) more studies of vaccine efficacy in young children and perhaps development of additional influenza vaccine products (and producers of vaccine products-now standing at only 1 for children <4 years old), and (2) more studies of antiviral agents for infants. Neither the amantadine nor neuraminidase inhibitors are approved for use in infants by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is past time for the pediatric community to begin to consider the needs that will likely arise and to advocate for the resources that will be required to address each of these issues (Table I) .",

If insufficient new federal dollars are available to deal with influenza, then serious consideration should be given to reprioritizing the large infusions of dollars designated for other potential bioterrorism agents, where the risk of disease occurrence is far less certain. Indeed, many of the issues that must be addressed for influenza are relevant to responses to other potentially widespread emerging infections (eg, SARS) and bioterrorism agents (eg, smallpox virus). 32 Figure. Configuration of working groups charged with planning for and oversight of responses to (1) bioterrorism events, (2) emerging infections such as SARS, and (3) pandemic influenza will, and likely must, vary from federal to state to local areas. At federal level, alignment of expertise and resources into dedicated groups that collaborate and have some overlap in membership at key agencies is likely most effective approach at this time. Configuration of state and large urban area working groups may vary depending on their specific population size and geographic characteristics, as well as expertise available in public and private sectors. At local level, those individuals from multiple public and private agencies who will need to work together in planning for and response to each of these types of events are largely the same, and types of issues they will be facing in each scenario would be highly similar, and, in many aspects, identical. Expertise in planning for and providing of care to children may not be readily available in many localities and may be unevenly distributed among states. Use of the precautionary principle with regard to the public health obligation to protect populations against foreseeable threats, 34 even under conditions of uncertainty, will be necessary. This application must be balanced by the principles of choosing the least restrictive/intrusive alternative, fairness and justice (both procedural and substantive). 35 Issues of child care for quarantined traveling families have received little discussion to date. Studies that assess the impact of school children on spread of influenza in the community are underway in the U.S. Additional epidemiologic studies assessing impact of other more crowded situations such as child care centers, shopping malls, and sports venues would be helpful.

The expert committee making recommendation to the FDA suggested that the Panama strain, rather than the Fujian strain, be included in the vaccine, mainly because of the uncertainty about which strain would predominate and whether the Fujian strain could be grown in time to be included in the vaccine. 14 Predicting whether an epizootic strain will cross the species barrier into human beings and initiate the next pandemic is even more difficult. 33 Genetic motifs that are associated with avian and mammalian virulence for some influenza strains are absent from other strains that cause severe human disease, such that inference of human virulence from animal models is not straightforward. An additional vaccine-related concern is that influenza A viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes cannot be grown in eggs, the current standard method of vaccine production, because of the rapid lethality of these strains to chick embryos (Table I, problem 4A). 33 A substantial international infrastructure to detect and hopefully interdict pandemic influenza has been put in place over the past 50 years.

Although stockpiling of supplies, including antiviral agents, would be helpful, it is unlikely that supply would meet the demand. Furthermore, amantadine and rimantadine are not active against some of the potential pandemic strains (eg, H5N1). This could leave us with only 1 antiviral class of drugs (ie, neuraminidase inhibitors) and no treatment option for infants, because oseltamivir is contraindicated in children less than 1 year of age based on a study, done by the manufacturer, showing increased central nervous system drug concentrations in a juvenile animal model.",

We fight a war on terrorism in part to diminish the risk of mass casualties from potential weapons of mass destruction. Pandemic influenza, poorly planned for and therefore poorly fought, would be a mass-casualty event worldwide. The key to effective intervention during a pandemic ultimately will be preparation at the local level, built on public and private sector collaboration, coordinated and supported by state and federal working groups. A wide range of pediatric expertise also must be brought to bear at the national and state levels in an effort to support response efforts for children at the local level. These planning efforts also will be useful for more effective management of other potential infectious and noninfectious scenarios causing serious widespread impact. Our time to prepare for the next influenza pandemic may well be short, for current events suggest that the pandemic clock is already ticking down.",
