For example, some studies have shown that NK cells may promote insulitis, destroy insulin-producing islet cells and promote the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) 5-8 .

Although different NK cell subsets or functions might be involved during different stages of the inflammatory process 2,3 , emerging evidence indicates that additional elements, such as organ-specific factors and cellular interactions, may also influence the divergent functions of NK cells in different organs and during different pathological conditions. Bone marrow-derived NK cell precursors undergo a maturation process that leads to the acquisition of their effector functions, changes in the expression of chemotactic receptors and adhesion molecules, and their migration from the bone marrow through the blood to the spleen, liver, lung and many other organs. The distribution of NK cells is not static because these cells can recirculate between organs 15 . Owing to the expression of chemokine receptors, such as CC-chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), CCR5, CXC-chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) and CX 3 C-chemokine receptor 1 (CX 3 CR1), NK cells can respond to a large array of chemokines 16 , and thus they can be recruited to distinct sites of inflammation [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] and extravagate to the parenchyma or body cavities. In contrast to B cells, T cells and dendritic cells (DCs), the detailed trafficking patterns of NK cells are not very well characterized.",

For example, the CX 3 Cchemokine ligand 1 (CX 3 CL1; also known as fractalkine) produced by neurons is necessary and sufficient to guide CX 3 CR1-bearing NK cells to the inflamed brain 10, 26 . Similarly, Kupffer cell-derived CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2; also known as MCP1) attracts CCR2expressing NK cells to the liver during murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection 27, 28 . The production of unique chemokines by organ-specific cell types for the recruitment of NK cells (TABLE 1) suggests that organ-intrinsic elements may be important in shaping NK cell homing during physiological and pathological conditions.",

This protection required interaction of NK cells with DCs in lymphoid organs, resulting in reduced neutrophil recruitment to the joints. These observations suggest opposite functions of NK cells in lymph nodes versus inflamed joints during rheumatoid arthritis. The current available information is not sufficient to provide a clear linkage between the divergent phenotypes and functions of NK cells in lymphoid organs and joints.

So, after homing to the inflamed CNS, NK cells become receptive to an array of cellular components that they have not encountered in the periphery.

In particular, it has been suggested that NK cells in the CNS can directly lyse microglia 11, 12 . Microglia are macrophage-like APCs that are capable of priming myelin-reactive T cells, and they exert direct effects on neuronal or glial cells depending on the timing of the inflammatory process and the activation status of these cells [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] . Microglia serve as sentinels for ongoing immune responses in the periphery that have the potential to spread to the CNS. In comparison with the behaviour of other types of APC in the CNS during brain inflammation, activated microglia appear to become targets of peripherally activated NK cells that enter the CNS 11 . Such interactions between NK cells and microglia are likely to be facilitated by the recruitment of microglia through CCL2 secretion by NK cells. As activated microglia have a crucial role in initiating and propagating pathogenic T cell responses during EAE, their elimination results in reduced numbers of myelin-reactive T helper 17 (T H 17) cells in the CNS 11 . Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, susceptibility of activated microglia to NK cell lysis may occur through the loss of MHC class I expression on these cells 11, 12 (FIG. 2) . These findings in mice are in apparent contrast with a recent study suggesting that human NK cells can lyse resting microglia but spare activated microglia in an in vitro culture system 105 . However, it remains unclear which NK cell subset executed this killing activity and how microglia were maintained within a resting state during this experiment.",

In a human-mouse chimaera model, it has been demonstrated that EAE can be ameliorated by transfusion of human NK cells 11 . As administration of NK cells directly into the brain appeared to achieve enhanced clinical benefits compared with systemically administered cells 11 , these results suggest that NK cells within the brain may have an anti-inflammatory role. Furthermore, there is some evidence to suggest that other drugs that are currently used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, such as IFN preparations and glatiramer acetate (a random polymer of the four amino acids found in myelin basic protein; also known as copolymer 1 or Copaxone (Teva Pharmaceuticals)), may achieve their clinical efficacy partially by inducing NK cells 116, 117 via a mechanism similar to that of daclizumab.",

In doing so, NK cells may kill infected or transformed cells. When this process becomes dysregulated, damage to neighbouring cells and autoimmune disease might ensue. Determinants for these divergent roles of NK cells, as exemplified here for a number of different organs, include the timing of immune responses, the different pathogens targeted by the NK cells and the NK cell-orchestrated immune responses. Furthermore, the studies discussed here raise the possibility that organ-specific factors shape NK cell phenotype and contribute to the organspecific functions of these cells. The organ-specific features of NK cells appear to be dictated by a number of factors that are intrinsic to a particular organ, including its anatomical structure, accessibility to peripheral immune cells, and the unique micro-environment of cells and soluble factors within the organ. Additional determinants include inciting pathogens or autoantigens that induce inflammation.",

The application of this and other techniques to studies of NK cells in solid organs should reveal valuable information on the physical localization of NK cells within specific anatomical structures, as well as interactions with resident cellular components.

In the steady state, commensal-derived lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that arrive in the liver from the gut through the portal vein ligate Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4, respectively, on Kupffer cells, triggering the release of interleukin-10 (IL-10) 126 . IL-10 in turn renders NK cells hyporesponsive to IL-12 and IL-18 and promotes tolerance in the liver. In addition, expression of the inhibitory receptor natural killer group 2, member A (NKG2A) is increased, whereas expression of the activating receptor LY49 is decreased on NK cells. c | During viral infection, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) ligates TLR3 and triggers Kupffer cells to release IL-6 and IL-18, which in turn activate NK cells and boost their killing activity. This is reflected by the phenotype of hepatic NK cells, which is characterized by the expression of high levels of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), perforin and granzymes, and a lack of LY49. Activated hepatic NK cells can lyse hepatocytes or stellate cells via TRAIL-dependent pathways during hepatitis B virus infection or fibrosis, respectively. Thus, Kupffer cells appear to have a dual role in shaping hepatic NK cell phenotype and function. Hepatic NK cells are also subjected to the influence of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) released by natural killer T (NKT) cells.
