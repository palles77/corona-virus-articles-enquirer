Improvement of influenza-like symptoms and quality of life (QOL) measurements were also observed. Only less than 2% reported minor adverse events. (4) The observation did not allow conclusive deductions since the trial was neither randomized nor placebo-controlled; and during the chaotic period of the deadly epidemic, measures to ensure a proper conduction of a trial were simply lacking. Nevertheless, a study of the immunological state of 40% the herbal consumers indicated that there was objective evidence of improvement of body defense system after two weeks of treatment. Interestingly, the boostering effect subsided two weeks later. (5) We therefore consider that further exploration on the efficacy of the herbal preparation is justified and a plan for a proper randomized controlled trial is thus constructed. Since the annual record of the Department of Health in Hong Kong, indicated that an endemic of influenza is likely to appear from February to April every year, a preventive program could be organized within this period accordingly.",

In another trial on healthy volunteers aiming at the behavior of immunomodulating indicators, i.e., T cells and B cells in the lymphocyte series, the results were also positive. (5) The series of objective data supporting the immuno-modulating efficacy of the herbal preparation threw optimism on the further research of using herbal preparations for the prevention or treatment of influenza or influenza-like upper respiratory viral infection. The direction would include the optimization of the herbal formula, by varying the components of the formula, or better still, by identifying the effective fraction from the gross extraction of the formula. The concept of disease prevention in herbal medicine is not one that follows the logic of immunization, which initiates a prolonged state of positive immuno-defense. Instead, the mechanism of action could be very much of a short term boostering of the immunological sensitivity which would be beneficial for the early control of an invading viral infection at its early stage.",
