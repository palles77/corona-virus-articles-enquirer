            "text": "It is unfortunately apparent that we are in the middle of an ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease that, according the World Health Organization, has now been characterised as a pandemic [1] . It appeared to have started in December 2019 when the first cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in Wuhan (Hubei, China) [2, 3] . This led to a rapid outbreak due to a novel strain of the coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, which stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The associated disease, now referred as COVID-19, rapidly spread in mainland China and then in the rest of the world with some countries like South Korea, Iran and Italy particularly affected. According to the John Hopkins University dashboard, updated on 12th March 2020, there is an overall worldwide figure of 127748 total confirmed cases, 4717 total deaths and 68305 total recovered [3] . At the time of writing this editorial the figures suggest that COVID-19 infection causes mild disease (i.e. non-pneumonia or mild pneumonia) in about 80 % of cases and most cases recover, 14 % have more severe disease and 6% experience critical illness; the latter being more likely amongst high-risk groups such as the elderly and those with other chronic underlying conditions [4] . Authorities in many countries have improved health measures and in some cases restricted movement and large gatherings of people in order to limit the spread of the virus and prevent an overburdening of hospitals. Italy, was the first country in the world that adopted extraordinary measures on the entire national territory for a period of 2 weeks, such as closures of museums, schools, universities, sports centres and football matches [5] . On 11th March Italy underwent a complete closure of all commercial activities and shops, with some exceptions for goods of primary important such as pharmacies, grocery stores etc. At the moment the Italian population is being asked to stay at home unless there are important reasons related to work or to make essential purchases such as food and medicines, and other urgent purposes.",

The droplets can make contact with the nose, mouth, eyes, or upper respiratory tract of another person through three main important routes (see Fig. 1 ) [13] . The first is an airborne transmission in case of close contact between people (within about 6 feet, about 1.8 m). The second is a direct contact transmission as when two people shake their hands and the contaminated hand then touches a risk area on the second person. The last source is an indirect contact transmission where an infected person touches a surface that is then touched by the second person. This latter route is due to the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 (as other coronaviruses) can survive for several hours on inanimate environments (e.g. objects surfaces) [14] . Although this is not considered the main way the virus spreads, it may be possible that a person can get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching own mouth, nose or eyes.",

A thorough cleaning of instruments used in CL practice such as trial frame and ophthalmic lenses, chin rest and head rest (slit lamp, keratometer etc.) can be performed effectively with water and detergent and applying commonly used hospital-level disinfectants (such as sodium hypochlorite, 70 % alcohol or an alternative disinfectant) [14, 16] . This should be done once the patient has left the room. In the case of specialty CL fitting such as RGP in keratoconus, OrthoK, and Scleral, where a trial set of CLs is used, it becomes very important to ensure that CL are disinfected well between patients. In these cases, rigorous infection control measures must be followed when trials lenses are reused [17] .",
