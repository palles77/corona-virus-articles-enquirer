            "text": "In early December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan, China resulting from a novel coronavirus infection designated as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) as of January 7, 2020, and named coronavirus-19 disease (COVID- 19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) as of February 11, 2020. 1 SARS-CoV-2 is a novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus, that represents the seventh member of the coronavirus family, which includes four common human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1) and two other strains including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 2,3 SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 79% and 50% phylogenetic similarity to SARS-Co-V and MERS-CoV, respectively. 2 This virus is suspected to have a zoonotic origin and is estimated to have resulted in 591,802 cases in 176 countries with 26,996 deaths as of March 27, 2020. 4 was first reported in the United States (U.S.) on January 20, 2020 and accounted for a total number of 100,717 cases and 1544 deaths as of March 27, 2020. 4 The morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 exceeds previous coronavirus infection outbreaks including SARS (8, 098 infections, 774 deaths) and MERS (2,458 infections, 848 deaths). 5, 6 An initial analysis of 72,314 cases from China revealed that an estimated 81% of infections are characterized as mild, 14% are severe, and 5% are critical (defined as respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure), with an overall fatality rate of 2.3%. 7 In the U.S., an analysis of 4,226 cases from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of reported estimated rates of hospitalization (20.7-31.4%), Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission (4.9-11.5%), and case fatality (1.8-3.4%). 8 The WHO declared a global health emergency on January 30, 2020 9 and pandemic status on March 11, 2020, respectively. 10 The most common presenting symptoms for COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, although other frequently observed symptoms include fatigue, headache, and muscle soreness. Extrapulmonary symptoms may occur early in the disease course. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea may occur early, but are rarely the sole presenting feature 11 ; GI symptoms may be associated with poor clinical outcomes including higher risk of mortality. 11 Of note, the first reported case of COVID-19 in the U.S. presented with a 2-day history of dry cough, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, followed by diarrhea on hospital day #2, with subsequent confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in a stool specimen. 12 Subsequent studies have confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 cases using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in stool specimens of patients with COVID-19 infection [13] [14] , with immunofluorescence data demonstrating that ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme II) is abundantly expressed in gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelia, thereby implicating ACE2 as a potential viral receptor for entry to uninfected host cells, and raising the possibility for fecal-oral transmission although it is unclear if the viral concentration in the stool is sufficient for transmission. 14 Furthermore, ACE2 receptors may additionally be expressed in hepatic cholangiocytes, potentially permitting direct infection of hepatic cells, and early cohort studies of COVID-19 have revealed that abnormal liver enzymes are commonly observed. 15 ",

Within the GRADE framework, evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) start as high-certainty evidence and observational studies start out as lowcertainty evidence but can be rated down for several reasons: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Additionally, evidence from well conducted observational studies start as low certainty evidence but can be rated up for large effects or dose-response. Judgments about the certainty were determined via video conference discussion to achieve consensus. The certainty of evidence was categorized into 4 levels ranging from very low to high (see Table 1 ). For each question, an overall judgment of certainty of evidence was made based on critical outcomes.",

For each guideline statement, the strength of the recommendation and the certainty of evidence to support the recommendation is provided. The words \"the AGA recommends\" are used for strong recommendations, and \"the AGA suggests\" for conditional recommendations (see Table 2 ). The panel deliberated over the impact of resource limitations on the feasibility and implementation of these recommendations. Therefore, the panel's main recommendations assume an ideal scenario where there are no resource constraints. However, in settings in which resources require rationing, additional guidance is also provided.",

            "text": "Guan et al published the largest cohort study to date which included 1,099 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from China. They reported that 5.0% of COVID-19 infected patients had nausea or vomiting and 3.8% had diarrhea. 21 30 A recent meta-analysis of 4243 patients from China suggested that approximately 17.6% of patients had any gastrointestinal symptom, including 9.2% with pain, 12.5% with diarrhea, 10.2% with nausea/vomiting. 31 One of the concerns with many of the published studies is the possible duplicate inclusion of the patients across reports, thereby limiting valid performance of pooled estimates in a meta-analysis. 32 There is evidence for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens independent of the presence of diarrhea. Some studies showed that stool continued to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA even after respiratory samples became negative. Chen et al reported a case of COVID-19 based on compatible symptoms and lung imaging in a patient with positive stool real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA but negative pharyngeal swabs and sputum samples. Furthermore, Wang et al reported confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 positive fecal samples in 2 patients without diarrhea. 12, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 What are the liver manifestations of COVID-19? Liver injury is estimated to occur in up to 20-30% of patients at the time of diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 14 Severe hepatitis has been reported but liver failure appears to be rare. 39 The pattern of liver injury appears to be predominantly hepatocellular, and the etiology remains uncertain but may represent a secondary effect of the systemic inflammatory response observed with COVID-19 disease, although direct viral infection and drug-induced liver injury cannot be excluded. One study of liver biopsy specimens obtained from a patient with COVID-19 disease revealed microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity, suggestive of either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury. 41 Abnormal liver enzymes may be observed in both adults and children with COVID-19, 42 and do not appear to be a major predictor of clinical outcomes. 15 Early studies have multiple methodologic limitations, with variable laboratory thresholds, limited longitudinal assessment of liver enzymes, heterogeneous evaluation for alternative etiologies, and limited information regarding baseline liver diseases and confounding variables. Additional studies are needed to further characterize the unique clinical considerations for SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with chronic liver disease and/or cirrhosis, 43 although preliminary guidance has been provided by the AASLD on March 23, 2020. 44 What are the potential risks to health care workers performing endoscopy? SARS-CoV-2 is presumed to spread primarily via respiratory droplets from talking, coughing, sneezing, and close contact with symptomatic individuals. However humanto-human transmission can occur from unknown infected persons (e.g. asymptomatic carriers or individuals with mild symptoms) as well as individuals with virus shedding during the pre-incubation period before symptoms develop. 45 Data related to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of the pandemic have confirmed that health care professionals are at higher risk of infection than the general population. The WHO and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) reported infection of 2055 health care workers as of February 20, 2020 during the index outbreak in Hubei Province, with health care workers facing a rate of infection approximately three times the general population. 46 This prompted the Chinese Department of Health Reform to deploy more than 40,000 additional health-care workers to the region, preserve personal protective equipment (PPE), and implement surveillance measures and quarantine protocols. 46 Such measures appear to have slowed the spread to health care workers, with recent cases primarily attributable to household contacts rather than occupational exposure. Similar trends have been observed in Europe, with an estimated 20% of COVID-19 infections in Italy occurring in health care workers. 47 Preliminary reports in the US also suggest that health care workers are at risk of nosocomial infections, including infection of 20 health care workers among the first 67 COVID-19 positive individuals in Philadelphia, and additional health care workers cases in WA, NY, and MA. 48, 49, 50 The spread of disease via health care workers is concerning for several reasons: a) appropriate PPE may not be utilized effectively, especially when COVID-19 patients cannot be identified quickly, b) shortage of health care workers due to infection and/or quarantine, and c) the concern of the role of infected health care workers to act as a vector for transmission to patients.",

Unlike surgical masks, respirator masks are designed to block aerosols. Respiratory protection in health care for airborne precautions commonly follows two filtering device paths, N95 mask respirators and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). The N95 masks filter at least 95% of aerosols (<5 \u03bcm) and dropletsize (5 \u03bcm to 50 \u03bcm) particles and are not resistant to oil. Light-weight, no-hose, powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) are a highly effective alternative to face masks. Air is forced through a large, multi-layer filter housed in the helmet and provide positive pressure within the face-shield compartment. These devices are approved by US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Hazard (NIOSH) and can provide high level protection from common airborne viruses that exceed N95 face masks without the need for \"fit-testing\" and have been used in a variety of settings. 56 PAPR also has the advantage of providing head and neck protection.

However, several studies from the SARS outbreak were identified that provide indirect evidence. The SARS outbreak reinforced the vital role of PPE in protecting health care workers from occupationally acquired infection. We used data from two existing systematic reviews by Offeddu 2017 and Tran 2012 to inform our recommendations. 58, 59 First, the systematic reviews by Offeddu et al included a meta-analysis of 3 observational studies that showed a benefit in using N95 respirators over standard masks in protecting health care workers from SARS (OR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0. 22 Table 4B ). Second, a systematic review from Tran et al revealed an increased risk of viral transmission in health care workers performing aerosol-generating procedures (mostly bronchoscopy or tracheal intubation). 59 (Supplemental Figure 3 ). Zamora and colleagues investigated the amount of contamination on the neck and face from individuals using a PAPR mask (in combination with N95) compared with a N95 mask alone 60 ; Individuals who used the PAPR-based strategy experienced a lower risk of face and neck contamination compared to N95 mask alone (RR = 0.08; 95% CI: 0.03-0.19). See Evidence Profile Table 5 , Supplemental Figure 4 . Limitations of these studies include small numbers of health care workers, and data on tracheal intubation or bronchoscopy, not GI endoscopy.",

It also assumes a small proportion of persons who are negative or have recovered from COVID-19; this may change with the availability of wider testing and the ability to test for past infection or immunity. Recent data from China, by Chang et al, revealed the greatest risk of COVID-19 exposure to health care workers during early stages of the pandemic when testing was not yet widely available. 61 In a JAMA report published from Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, 29.3% (40 of 138) of COVID-19 infected patients were health care workers who presumably had hospital-acquired infections. 27 Among 493 health care workers caring for hospitalized patients, 10/493 health care workers became infected with COVID-19; all 10 were unprotected health care workers (no mask) caring for patients on medical wards with a low risk of exposure (no known or suspected COVID-19 patients). In contrast, none of the 278 protected health care workers (N95 mask) caring for high risk patients (known or suspected COVID-19) became infected (aOR 464.82; 95% CI: 97.73 to infinite). 62 One study, evaluating health care worker exposure in the care of one COVID-19 positive patient, revealed that none of 41 health care workers (surgical masks only) developed infection despite absence of N95 mask, although studies evaluating health care workers in context of larger cohorts of COVID-19 positive patients are not yet available. 63 The decision to extend the recommendation to lower GI procedures is based on evidence of possible aerosolization during colonoscopy especially during the insertion and removal of instruments through the biopsy channel. 53 and the uncertain risks associated with evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal samples. These data provided indirect evidence to extend the recommendation to lower GI procedures pending more definitive evidence. 33 Limited resource settings Recommendation 4: In extreme resource-constrained settings involving health care workers performing any GI procedures, regardless of COVID-19 status, the AGA suggests extended use/re-use of N95 masks over surgical masks, as part of appropriate personal protective equipment.

The data on PAPR re-use after cleaning and disinfection were also limited with select institutions reporting on their experience with established PAPR programs and instructions for cleaning. 70 Discussion and Rationale There is insufficient evidence to comment on the safety of re-use (up to 5 consecutive donnings) and extended use (over 8 hours) of masks and other PPE. Limited indirect evidence suggests loss of durability and fit of N95 masks under these conditions. With regards to PAPRs with disposable protective shields, the protective shields may be disinfected with standard biocidal containing wipes and reused.

Studies examining the natural bioburden levels detected on flexible GI endoscopes show ranges from 10 5 CFU/ml to 10 10 CFU/ml after clinical use; appropriate cleaning followed by HLD (a process that eliminates or kills all vegetative bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses, except for small numbers of bacterial spores) reduces the number of microorganisms and organic debris by 4 logs, or 99.99%. 79 Studies examining the risk of viral transmission of hepatitis B, C or HIV among patients have demonstrated a very low risk of transmission. 80 Several cases of patient-to-patient HCV transmission have been reported but these were related to inadequate cleaning and disinfection of GI endoscopes and accessories and/or the use of contaminated anesthetic vials or syringes. A recent review by Kampf et al shows effective inactivation of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, by standard biocidal agents, which are active ingredients in current endoscopic disinfecting solutions ( Table 8) . 81 Discussion and Rationale Decontamination of coronavirus species has been confirmed with commonly used biocidal agents for decontamination, such as hydrogen peroxide, alcohols, sodium hypochlorite or benzalkonium chloride. 81, 82 There are ample data to support continuation of current endoscope decontamination practices in the context of known COVID-19. 79 Similar biocidal agents are additionally present in hospital-grade disinfecting wipes commonly used to decontaminate surfaces for endoscopy room cleaning. 81 Guidance on how to implement a triage system See accompanying Flowchart Figure 5 ",

Studies in lower GI bleeding suggest little difference in outcomes such as blood transfusions or surgery when comparing urgent colonoscopy (< 24 hours) vs delayed colonoscopy (up to 72 hours after presentation) 86, 87 In a pandemic setting, one might consider opting to delay the procedure (especially while awaiting COVID-19 testing). In contrast, a patient presenting with an upper GI bleed likely should have an EGD performed within 24 hours. 88, 89 The impact of delays in diagnosis may also have significant ramifications on immediate management (e.g. in question of inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis or treatment) and on cancer treatment decisions (e.g. colon cancer, pancreatic cancer etc). Additionally, tests related to treatment of precancerous lesions may also lead to anxiety among patients and providers (e.g. treatment of high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's or an endoscopic mucosal resection for a larger colon polyp). Indirect evidence supports that delays of weeks to a few months in some cancer diagnoses may not lead to progression of stage or worse clinical outcomes even when symptoms are present in some GI cancers. 90, 91, 92 Non-time sensitive procedures are most routine screening and surveillance colonoscopy. There is evidence to suggest that following a positive FIT test, a colonoscopy can be delayed up to six months without negatively impacting patient outcomes. Corley et al. reported on 70,124 patients with a positive FIT test and found no difference in outcome of colorectal cancer diagnosis and advanced stage disease when the colonoscopy was performed in 8-30 days following the test vs waiting up to six months. However, when delaying 7-9 months there was a non-significant increase in risk and a more profound increase risk when delayed > 12 months. Using data from this study, one could suggest that in patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening, even when a test suggests a possible polyp or cancer, delaying the procedure for some period of time may not be harmful on the population level. 93 Discussion/Rationale:",

The panel also acknowledged the limitations of the body of evidence in assessing the time-sensitive nature of endoscopic procedures.

International registries such as the Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Under Research and Exclusion, or SECURE-IBD, (https://covidibd.org), may serve as a valuable data source in the future as clinicians engage in information sharing to inform stronger evidence-based guidance. Ongoing clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment may be associated with GI adverse effects and increase the demands for GI consultative care. Furthermore, the severity and duration of resource limitations for SARS-CoV-2 testing and PPE may further challenge clinical management decisions. Importantly, due to the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, these recommendations will likely need to be updated within a short timeframe. We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.",

Furthermore, indirect evidence from other pandemic outbreaks did not reveal empiric data on infection rates, but rather reports of anecdotal experience or experiments under laboratory conditions or mathematical models. Anecdotal reports on using SMs over N95 as a barrier to pathogens and extend the useful life of the N95 respirator has been published 65 . This was sparingly utilized during the SARS outbreak, but the effects of prolonged use of this combination on HCWs and the infection rate have not been reported. Similarly, reports exists that more than 40% of HCWs reused their N95 during the H1N1 pandemic 66, 67 . Furthermore, a mathematical model to calculate the potential influenza contamination of facemasks from aerosol sources in various exposure scenarios, showed that single cough (\u224819 viruses) were much less than likely levels from aerosols (4,473 viruses on FFRs and 3,476 viruses on SMs) 68 . In laboratory testing has been reported that 5 consecutive donning's can be performed before fit factors consistently drop to unsafe levels 69 . In addition, decontamination of N95 with hydrogen peroxide has showed that exposure up to 50 cycles does not degrade the filtration media and mechanical testing but has demonstrated that the elastic straps were stiffer after exposure to up to 20 HPV cycles. Thus, more than 20 cycles may impair proper fit 70 . There have been narrative reports, news conference reports and the CDC recommendation 98 during H1N1 pandemic suggesting use of a cleanable face shield or surgical mask to reduce N95 respirator contamination 64 .",
