            "text": "Coronaviruses are responsible for a significant proportion of annual respiratory and enteric infections in humans and other mammals. The most prominent of these viruses is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which causes acute respiratory and gastrointestinal infection in humans. The coronavirus main protease, 3CL pro , is a key target for broad-spectrum antiviral development due to its critical role in viral maturation and high degree of structural conservation among coronaviruses. Dimerization is an indispensable requirement for the function of SARS 3CL pro and is regulated through mechanisms involving both direct and long-range interactions in the enzyme. While many of the binding interactions at the dimerization interface have been extensively studied, those that are important for long-range control are not well understood. Characterization of these dimerization mechanisms is important for the structure-based design of new treatments targeting coronavirus-based infections. Here we report that Asn28, a residue located 11 \u00c5 away from the closest residue in the opposing monomer, is essential for the enzymatic activity and dimerization of SARS 3CL pro . Mutation of this residue to alanine almost completely inactivates the enzyme and results in a 19.2-fold decrease in the dimerization K d . The crystallographic structure of the N28A mutant determined at a 2.35 \u00c5 resolution reveals the critical role of Asn28 in maintaining the structural integrity of the active site and in orienting key residues involved in binding at the dimer interface and substrate catalysis. These findings provide a deeper insight into complex mechanisms regulating the activity and dimerization of SARS 3CL pro .",

            "text": "We previously reported that dimerization is controlled not only through direct contacts at the dimer interface, but is also coordinated through long-range interactions (21) . Specifically, it was determined that Serine 147, a highly conserved residue located over 9 \u00c5 away from the closest residue in the opposing monomer, is critical for maintaining proper enzymatic activity and dimerization of SARS 3CL pro (21) . Mutation of this residue to alanine completely interfered with the dimerization and activity of the protease. In the wild type structure, the side chain hydroxyl of Ser147 donates two hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyls of Ser144 and Cys117, as shown in Figure 1 . These interactions are part of an intricate hydrogen bonding network surrounding the active site of the protein. We postulated that the interactions formed by the side chain of Ser147 are instrumental in maintaining the position of the critical loop defined by residues 139-147 with respect to the adjacent \u03b2-sheet, which contains residues Cys117 and Tyr126. Although the structural basis for this dramatic effect was not readily apparent based on the location of Ser147 within the structure of the wild type enzyme, two possible mechanisms were proposed. In the first mechanism, loss of the interaction between Ser147 and Ser144 may induce a repositioning of Phe140 which would disrupt the hydrophobic pocket formed by Phe140 and Tyr126 from the same chain and Met6 from the opposing chain. Met6 was previously shown to be important for the activity and dimerization of the protease (9) . In the second mechanism, the loss of the hydrogen bonding interaction between the side chain of Ser147 and the backbone of Cys117 may result in the repositioning of the \u03b2-sheet on which Cys117 resides. This change will affect Tyr126 (located on the opposite end of the \u03b2sheet containing Cys117) thereby disrupting its aromatic stacking interaction with Phe140 of the same chain and the hydrophobic interaction with Met6 from the opposing chain. Alternatively, a combination of these two possibilities may also explain the diminished capacity of the S147A mutant to dimerize.",

Asn28 is a buried residue that makes extensive interactions with both the catalytic loop and the beta sheet where Cys117 is located ( Figure 1B) , suggesting that this residue, like Ser147, may also play a central role in regulating the dimerization and activity of the protease. If so, disrupting the key interactions made by the side chain of Asn28 would likely result in severe losses in enzymatic activity and dimerization, despite the fact that Asn28 is not located at the dimerization interface. While Asn28 itself does not lie in a cavity that can be targeted with small molecule inhibitors, the elucidation of the network of interactions that control dimerization and activity of 3CL pro provides new avenues for the development of novel allosteric inhibitors of the enzyme.",

Mutation of this residue to alanine rendered the enzyme almost completely inactive and resulted in a 19.2-fold decrease in the dimerization K d . In order to elucidate the structural basis for the observed loss in activity and dimerization, a crystallographic structure of the N28A mutant was determined at a 2.35 \u00c5 resolution. The N28A structure revealed that the mutation induced significant rearrangements in and around the active site of the enzyme as compared to previously determined wild type SARS 3CL pro structures. Specifically, the side chains of residues Cys145 and Cys117 flipped almost 180\u00b0 from their locations in the wild type to form a novel disulfide bond in the structure of the N28A mutant. While a majority of the interactions at the dimer interface remained intact as compared to the wild type protease, no electron density was observed for residues Ser139-Phe140-Leu141, indicating that these residues are most likely disordered in the N28A structure. The disorder observed for these particular residues is significant given the recent finding that the Ser139-Phe140-Leu141 residues may be involved in an overlapping network linking catalysis and dimerization in the enzyme (27) . The results presented here confirm that long-range interactions in SARS 3CL pro are critical for maintaining its oligomeric state and activity, and provide additional evidence that dimerization and catalysis are linked through key residues which collectively regulate enzymatic function.",

The N28A mutation had a similar effect on the denaturation transition for the protease as the previously reported S147A mutation (21) . A downward shift in T m of 1.8 \u00b0C was observed as compared to the wild type enzyme (the S147A mutant displayed a downward shift of 1.7 \u00b0C) as summarized in Table 1 .

The data were analyzed using the programs SEDFIT (30) and SEDPHAT (32) , and all experimental sedimentation coefficient values were converted to S 20,w in SEDPHAT. A sedimentation velocity profile of N28A at 20 \u00b0C, 50,000 rpm and a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL is shown in Figure 3 (Panels A, B, and C) . Two peaks are observed in the continuous sedimentation distribution profile. The first peak is centered at 2.8S and the second at 3.8S, corresponding to the monomeric and dimeric species, respectively. These peaks are slightly shifted from their positions in the sedimentation profile for the wild type enzyme which are at 2.6S and 4.1S, respectively (shown in Figure 3D ). In addition, the peaks are not well separated, which may indicate that the kinetic rate constant for self-association in the mutant may differ from the wild type enzyme, which sediments in two well-separated peaks. Although Asn28 is located far away from the dimerization interface, mutation of this residue to alanine has a detrimental effect on the ability of the protease to dimerize, although the effect does not appear as drastic as that previously observed with the S147A mutant which predominantly exists as a monomer in solution (21) . Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation was performed with the N28A mutant at three protein concentrations (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/mL) and three rotor speeds (15,000 rpm, 20,000 rpm, and 25,000 rpm) at 20 \u00b0C in order to evaluate the dissociation constant for the mutant. The data was globally analyzed using the monomer-dimer self-association model in the program SEDPHAT (32) . Figure 3 (Panels E and F) shows the results of the wild type and N28A data sets at 0.5 mg/mL. The residuals are well-dispersed and fit well to the monomerdimer model. The K d obtained was 25.0 \u00b1 5.1 \u00b5M, which is a 19.2-fold decrease compared to the wild type enzyme which we determined to have a K d of 1.3 \u00b5M under the same conditions (21) .",

The final model, comprising residues 3-138 and 142-301, was refined to a 2.35 \u00c5 resolution with an R-value of 21.7% (R free = 27.7%). The N28A mutation did not cause any large changes in the overall tertiary organization of SARS 3CL pro as shown in Figure 4A . The N28A structure aligns well with that of the wild type enzyme (PDB ID 2BX4 (18)), with an r.m.s.d. of 0.555 \u00c5 over 271 C\u03b1 atoms. Inspection of the catalytic domains in the region surrounding the N28A mutation revealed that significant structural changes occur in and around the active site. One of the most striking consequences of the N28A mutation is the formation of a novel disulfide bond between the catalytic residue Cys145 and residue Cys117 as depicted in Figure 5 . This disulfide bridge is absent in crystal structures of the wild type enzyme obtained under identical conditions (see for example (13) ). The side chains of both residues flip almost 180\u00b0 from their positions in the wild type protein to form the only disulfide bond found in the protein. The drastic loss in enzymatic activity measured for N28A in the kinetic experiments is likely due to the new orientation of the side chain of Cys145, which points away from the active site cavity which would be expected to hinder substrate catalysis. Some or all of the interactions made by the side chain of Asn28 observed in the wild type protease ( Figure 1B ) appear to be essential for directing the side chain of Cys145 into the active site cavity and Cys117 in the opposite direction. In addition to the loss in hydrogen bonding interactions made by the side chain of Asn28, structural rearrangements due to the change in van der Waals volume due to the mutation to the smaller alanine residue may also contribute to this effect. The formation of this disulfide bridge appears to be related to the loss of enzyme activity as suggested by experiments (not shown) in which enzyme activity was observed to increase as the concentration of a reducing agent in solution was increased.",

The side chain of Ser147 shifts from the position it is typically found within the wild type structure so that it is no longer in position to interact with the main chain atoms of Ser144 and Cys117 in the N28A mutant, as shown in Figure 6 . The oxyanion hole formed by the backbone amides of Ser144 and Gly143 is completely collapsed. Moreover, electron density for residues 139-141 was not visible in the 2F o -F c electron density map of the N28A mutant, indicating that this portion of the loop is likely disordered. Disorder in this loop is significant due to the fact that these residues are located at the dimer interface ( Figure 4B ) and a significant decrease in dimerization for this mutant was observed in the ultracentrifugation experiments. In wild type 3CL pro structures, Phe140 stacks with Tyr126 of the same monomer, which in turn makes a hydrophobic interaction with the side chain of Met6 of the opposing monomer; mutation of Phe140 to alanine has been observed to completely disrupt the catalytic activity of the enzyme and reduces dimerization to almost half that of the wild type (26) . The side chain of Ser139 donates a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of Gly2 of the opposing chain.

The only major change observed in the positions of the first fourteen residues of the N-terminus was a rotation in the side chain of Phe3. This residue has been mutated previously (26) and shown to have no effect on the oligomeric state of the enzyme; although the mutation did severely affect enzymatic activity. Similarly, only very small changes in the positions of the remaining residues at the interface are observed.

Recently published crystallographic structures of SARS 3CL pro monomeric mutants provide additional support for this possibility (27, 40) . Shi et al. (27) proposed the idea that the link between dimerization and catalysis in SARS 3CL pro lies in an overlapping network of residues which are involved in both catalysis and dimerization, and that a loss in the capability of the protease to dimerize leads to the trapping of key catalytic residues in a collapsed state, rendering the enzyme unable to efficiently perform catalysis. Specifically, the authors demonstrated that mutation of Arg298 (located at the C-terminus of the protein) resulted in a completely inactive and monomeric enzyme. In the wild type, Arg298 interacts with Met6 of the same chain, which in turn sits in a hydrophobic pocket with Phe140 and Tyr126 of the opposing chain. When the crystallographic structure of the monomeric R298A mutant was determined, a 40-degree rotation was observed between the catalytic domains and the third domain, despite the finding that all three domains retained their overall architecture. Inspection of the catalytic domains in the mutant reveals that a key catalytic loop has a changed conformation. In particular, residues Ser139-Phe140-Leu141 switched from their standard loop conformation in the wild type structure to form a short 3 10helix in the structure of the mutant. Moreover, a comparison of this structure to other known wild type structures revealed that a similar 3 10 -helix is present in wild type structures with protomers in a catalytically inactive conformation and has also since been observed in the structure of another monomeric SARS 3CL pro mutant (40) .",

Furthermore, the dual role of these residues in both dimerization and catalysis also explains how residues located in regions of the protein close to the active site cavity and away from the dimerization interface, such as Asn28 and Ser147, affect the oligomeric state of the protein.

It has become increasingly clear that long-distance communication is not solely restricted to proteins falling into the category of traditional allosteric systems, but instead a common occurrence in many globular proteins. Long range interactions regulate processes important for ligand binding, enzyme catalysis, protein folding and oligomerization (41) . For a number of these proteins, it has been shown that dynamic intramolecular networks exist that can be perturbed through the introduction of a single point mutation (21,41,42 45,46) . Clarkson et al. showed that point mutations made to the serine protease inhibitor Eglin c altered the side-chain dynamics of a contiguous series of residues as far as 13 \u00c5 away from the point of mutation (41) . Ornithine decarboxylase, a validated drug target for African sleeping sickness, has also displayed evidence of long-range energetic coupling between the active site of the enzyme (formed at the dimer interface) and individual residues located in distal regions of the interface (~15 \u221220 \u00c5 away) which play key roles in enzyme function without largely affecting dimer formation (42) .

            "text": "Asn28 is a conserved residue located adjacent to the active site of SARS 3CL pro . Mutation of this residue to an alanine drastically reduced enzymatic activity and resulted in a 19.2-fold drop in the dimerization K d as measured by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation. Crystallographic analysis of the mutant revealed large changes within the active site cavity of the protein, specifically in the movement of the catalytic residue, Cys145, which moved from its original position in the wild type enzyme to form a novel disulfide bond with the side chain of Cys117, that also made a large shift from its original position in the wild type protein. This large change is likely the cause for the decrease observed in the k cat value of the mutant protein with respect to the wild type enzyme. Residues 139-141 were disordered in the crystal structure and were the only residues at the dimer interface of the protein to display largely significant changes, indicating that the change in conformation of these residues may be the cause of the 19.2-fold drop in the dimerization K d . These results support our recent finding that dimerization of the SARS 3CL pro is regulated through long-range cooperative interactions and that dimerization and catalysis are linked through key residues which maintain the structural integrity of the enzyme. The enzymatic activities of wild type 3CL pro (\u2022) and N28A (\u25b2) were determined at 25\u00b0C with an enzyme concentration of 1 \u00b5M in 10mM sodium phosphate, 10mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1mM TCEP (pH 7.4). The initial velocity (\u00b5M per second) is plotted as a function of substrate concentration. (B) Thermal denaturation of wild type (black) and N28A (red) SARS 3CL pro as determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Excess heat capacity is plotted as a function of temperature. Calorimetric scans for both proteins were performed at identical concentrations (0.2 mg/mL) at a scanning rate of 1\u00b0C per minute. .

Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation of (E) wild type SARS 3CL pro and (F) N28A SARS 3CL pro at 0.5 mg/ml. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments with wild type and mutant SARS 3CL pro were carried out at 20 \u00b0C at concentrations of 0.25 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, and 1 mg/ml in six-channel centerpieces and globally analyzed in SEDPHAT (32) . Data at 0.5 mg/mL (14.8 \u00b5M) is shown for both wild type and N28A. The lower graph in each panel shows the raw data at 15,000 rpm (\u25b3), 20,000 rpm (\u25cb), and 25,000 rpm (\u25a1) and the corresponding global fits displayed in a solid line.
