The outcome of 39 pregnancies after artificial insemination or natural service during a 4 month period of risk for contracting BVDV was nine abortions, one mummified foetus, one stillbirth, three calves that died within I week of age, 12 calves persistently infected (PI) with BVDV (11 males and one female) and 13 non-PI calves. Retrospective studies showed that only two of the 13 dams (15.4%) ofnon-PI calves had been inseminated once, which is a significantly (P< 0.001 ) lower rate than for 192 other gestations (66.7%) during the 3 year period.",

Five of the 12 dams of the PI calves had not expelled the foetal membranes within 2 days after calving, which is a higher (P<0.001) incidence than the seven cases of retained placenta observed after 198 other calvings. Furthermore, there was a 4.4-fold higher risk (P < 0.01 ) of treatment for enteritis and/or pneumonia in calves and a 6.0-fold higher risk of calf mortality associated with the introduction of BVDV. The mean heart girth of the PI calves was less (P< 0.05) than that of non-PI calves, at both 80 and 180 days of age.",

The outcome of transplacental infections with this pestivirus includes abortions and foetal anomalies such as cerebellar and thymus hypoplasia and ocular defects (for a review, see Van Oirschot, 1983) . When an infection with a noncytopathic strain of BVDV occurs before 120 days of gestation, the foetus may develop immune tolerance to the virus and thereby a pre-and postnatal lifelong infection (McClurkin et al., 1984) . Because of this tolerance, persistently infected (PI) calves have no, or only a low level of, antibodies to BVDV. The PI calves may develop normally and reach breeding age, though they are often small and have a poor growth rate and an unthrifty appearance. PI calves also run the risk of developing the fatal condition called mucosal disease (Roeder and Drew, 1984; Brownlie et al., 1984) . The latter is thought to be the consequence of a mutation of the persistent non-cytopathic infecting virus to a cytopathic form (Howard et al., 1987) or a reinfection with a cytopathic strain (Brownlie et al., 1984) .",

An offspring of this cow, calved in late February, developed diarrhoea on 5 March and was slaughtered on 10 March. At necropsy, among other findings, there were erosions of the epithelia of the mucosa in the mouth, oesophagus and abomasum. Attempts to isolate BVDV from sera of the two animals failed. At this time, however, BVDV was isolated from a 1-month-old calf that was slaughtered because of severe pneumonia. On 27 March, milk samples were collected from all lactating cows and blood samples from all non-lactating animals. All but three animals proved antibody-positive to BVDV.

No animal had been brought to the farm during the 5 year period preceding the reproductive failure, but pregnant heifers were in contact with a neighbour's heifers during the summer of 1989 while at pasture. It might be that this contact then resulted in the birth of a PI calf that spread the virus during the winter of [1989] [1990] . No such PI calf was ever identified in March 1990 when all animals were tested, but possibly it was one of those calves that died early in 1990. The first known PI calf was born on 1 July 1990 and according to the established concept of the pathogenesis of persistent infection (McClurkin et al., 1984; Brownlie et al., 1986) , this calf was most likely infected as a foetus in December 1989 or January 1990. The spread of BVDV was not very rapid, as three animals were still seronegative to BVDV on 27 March. It is possible that BVDV infection was involved in the respiratory disease, or the outbreak of diarrhoea among the adult cattle, resembling winter dysentery, in January 1990. However, it is not thought unlikely that the diarrhoea was caused by BVDV alone but, more probably, was the result of an infection with bovine coronavirus (for a review see Saif, 1990) , with or without a concurrent BVDV infection .",

In the present study, only two of 13 cows and heifers inseminated during the BVDV risk period and which subsequently gave birth to non-PI calves had been inseminated once only ( Table  3 ) . One of these two cows proved seronegative in March 1990 and was therefore not likely to have been exposed to BVDV during the risk period. Furthermore, seven of 13 dams of non-PI calves had an interval between two inseminations of 60 days or more, strongly indicating early abortions or resorptions. This finding accords closely with the results from experimental and natural infection of heifers 30 days after insemination, in which foetal death occurred in every case (Carlsson et al., 1989) . In contrast, the dams of the PI calves had a normal InSm~an during the BVDV risk period (Table 3 ) .",

            "text": "This study also adduces new data to the BVDV syndrome--increased gestational length and retained placenta in cows producing PI offspring. However, only multiparous cows (but not heifers) producing PI calves had a longer mean gestation than controls, which is why the implications of these results must be carefully weighed. A long gestation has little or no effect on the incidence of retained placenta, whereas a short gestation increases the risk of retained placenta (Joosten et al., 1991 ) . Moreover, other factors such as abortions, twins, dystocia, calving season, breed, zero-grazing, sire, advancing age of dam, and retention of placenta at a previous calving all increase the risk of retained placenta (Dyrendahl et al., 1977; Bendixen et al., 1987; Joosten et al., 1991 ) . In this study, such risk factors for retained placenta were not present to any greater extent in gestations resulting in PI calves, than for other gestations (data not shown). Therefore, known risk factors cannot account for the high incidence of retained foetal membranes among the dams producing PI calves (41, 7%), which is a considerably higher rate than either the 3.5% observed after 198 other calvings in the herd or the 5.9% reported from an epidemiological study including more than 100 000 cows of Swedish Red and White breed (Bendixen et al., 1987 ) . Thus, carrying a PI foetus can be a risk factor for retained placenta.",

            "text": "In conclusion, this study shows that an ongoing BVDV infection in a dairy herd severely affects the reproductive performance of heifers and cows at risk and also has an adverse effect on calf health. Overall losses caused by BVDV in a herd can be estimated only if adequate diagnostic methods are used in combination with careful recording of reproduction and morbidity data over a lengthy time span. This is why all the adverse effects of ongoing BVDV infections in the past have in most cases been overlooked. After the culling of PI calves, the herd described in this paper became free of BVDV infection, judging from a serosurvey performed in April 1992 on sera from 6-12 month old calves. The owner has decided to keep the herd free of BVDV which, according to our experience, can be achieved by avoiding contact with BVDV-infected cattle.",
