            "text": "In this paper, we study the dynamics of a vector-borne disease model with two transmission paths: direct transmission through contact and indirect transmission through vector. The direct transmission is considered to be a non-monotone incidence function to describe the psychological effect of some severe diseases among the population when the number of infected hosts is large and/or the disease possesses high case fatality rate. The system has a disease-free equilibrium which is locally asymptomatically stable when the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) is less than unity and may have up to four endemic equilibria. Analytical expression representing the epidemic growth rate is obtained for the system. Sensitivity of the two transmission pathways were compared with respect to the epidemic growth rate. We numerically find that the direct transmission coefficient is more sensitive than the indirect transmission coefficient with respect to R 0 and the epidemic growth rate. Local stability of endemic equilibria is studied. Further, the global asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium is proved using Li and Muldowney geometric approach. The explicit condition for which the system undergoes backward bifurcation is obtained. The basic model also exhibits the hysteresis phenomenon which implies diseases will persist even when R 0 < 1 although the system undergoes a forward bifurcation and this phenomenon is rarely observed in disease models. Consequently, our analysis suggests that the diseases with multiple transmission routes exhibit bi-stable dynamics. However, efficient application of temporary control in bi-stable regions will curb the disease to lower endemicity. In addition, increase in transmission heterogeneity will increase the chance of disease eradication. 7 12 directly by person-to-person contact and indirectly through a vector. Understanding the transmission 13 dynamics of such diseases is of utmost interest. Mathematical models of epidemic diseases have been 14 very insightful in uncovering epidemiology and transmission patterns of the diseases. It is very important 15 to understand such epidemic patterns for better public health interventions and control of outbreaks. 16 Another important objective of these models is to inform public health organizations about the effect of 17 control policies on a certain population. However, hosts behaviour and psychological factors are some-18 times the main drivers of further transmission of the disease. For example, the epidemic outbreak of 19 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (3; 4) had such psychological effects and individual protection 20 1 doi: bioRxiv preprint 32 However, the dynamics of an epidemic model with two transmission routes where the direct trans-33 mission incorporates psychological effect has not been studied so far. The ongoing MERS-CoV epidemic 34 and zika virus epidemic are examples of diseases with two routes of transmission having psychological 35 effects. The psychosocial implication on the disease outbreak is more dangerous than any other phys-36 ical effect. West Nile Virus outbreak in the US is a good example for the onset of psychogenic illness 37 (10) and may generate mistrust towards national or health authorities. For example, the mild effects 38 of Zika virus, there is a correlation between psychosis with fetus microcephaly where pregnant women 39",

Finally, 55 discussion and conclusion is presented in Section 7. 56 2. Model formulation 57 We consider two population groups as host and vector population. Time-dependent state variables 58 are taken to describe the compartments of the two populations. Let at time t, N h (t) represents total 59 host population and N v (t) represents total vector population. We consider a 'SIR' type model for the 60 host population and a 'SI' type model for the vectors. The host population is subdivided into three 61 mutually disjoint classes: susceptible, S h ; infected, I h ; recovered, R h . Thus, at any time t, the size of 62 the host population is given by N h = S h + I h + R h . The vector population consist of two classes namely, 63 susceptible vectors, S v ; and infected vectors, I v . With this division, the size of the vector population 64 2 .
