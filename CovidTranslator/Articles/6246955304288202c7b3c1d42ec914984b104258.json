Method: Patients ! 18 years old who either had not received corticosteroid or had taken corticosteroids within 14 days from symptom onset were included. Patients receiving corticosteroids beyond 15 days or other investigational treatment within 21 days from symptom onset were excluded. Of 1313 eligible patients, 1287 with major corticosteroid dosage-type combinations were analysed. Results: Crude death rate was lower among 1188 steroid-treated patients compared to 99 patients in Group No Steroid (17.0% vs. 28.3%). Among four corticosteroid groups studied, mortality was lowest in the low-dose oral prednisolone (Group P) and high-dose methylprednisolone (Group MP) groups. On multivariate analysis of the corticosteroid groups, independent factors related to death were: corticosteroid group, older age, co-morbidity, worse chest X-ray score, worse respiratory status at Days 8e10 and higher admission white cell count. Again Groups P and MP had significantly lower adjusted odds ratios for death and lower bacterial and fungal culture rates. Despite worse chest X-ray scores and higher cumulative corticosteroid dosages in Group MP compared to Group P, fewer patients required rescue pulsed corticosteroid. Patients on hydrocortisone (Group HC) had the highest positive culture rates.",

In Hong Kong, corticosteroids were widely used because of its reported efficacy in mainland China, 1 and because four of five initial SARS patients died with best supportive treatment alone without corticosteroid. Survival rates in Hong Kong had improved with combined corticosteroids and ribavirin treatment in subsequent patients. 2e5 Methylprednisolone in ''pulsed'' dosages (at !500 mg per dose) was also frequently added to the baseline corticosteroid regimen on further deterioration or recrudescence of symptoms and signs. 1e6 SARS has been proposed to be a triphasic disease, commencing with viral replication, followed by immunopathological damage and finally pulmonary destruction. 6 Advocates of corticosteroids aimed at controlling the immunopathological phase of SARS 5, 7 and suppressing elevated cytokines levels. 8 Opponents contended that a selflimiting course had been observed in SARS even with significant initial chest radiograph involvement, 9, 10 and that corticosteroids only increased susceptibility to secondary infections. 11, 12 The Hong Kong Hospital Authority SARS Collaborative Group (HASCOG) tracked information of all probable and confirmed Hong Kong SARS patients as defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria. 13 In the following study, we aimed to study the patterns of corticosteroids usage and the associated treatment outcomes.",

Where PaO 2 values were not available, they were estimated from oxygen saturation values obtained by pulse oximetry (SpO 2 ) using the oxygen dissociation curve, with the help of an equation which relates SpO 2 to PaO 2 at standard temperature (37 C). 14 Respiratory status was categorised according to the worst P/F ratio on any day: 0e 26.5 kPa (0e199 mmHg) being ''acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)'' and 26.6e39.9 kPa (200e299 mmHg) being ''acute lung injury (ALI)''. 15 Higher values were arbitrarily divided into ''mild respiratory impairment'' (RI, 40.0e 53.2 kPa or 300e399 mmHg) and normal (53.3e 62.0 kPa or 400e465 mmHg).

The majority of patients, totalling 1188 (92.3%), had received corticosteroid. Two hospitals had used centre-specific treatment protocols 3,5 on most of their patients throughout the outbreak, in which the dosages and types of corticosteroids used were clearly defined, while the other 12 hospitals had utilised two or more corticosteroid regimens. Patients were grouped based on the commonest corticosteroid types used in 1188 patients, in order of frequency, as follows: hydrocortisone (Group HC), methylprednisolone (Group MP), pulsed methylprednisolone (Group Pulse), and prednisolone (Group P). Only 99 patients received no steroid (Group No Steroid) and were distributed in 13 hospitals. A step-down strategy in corticosteroid dosages was observed in all steroid treatment groups unless deterioration occurred which called for the use of pulsed methylprednisolone rescue. Details of individual patients in the Group No Steriod were not retrieved, but to our knowledge some patients had minor disease diagnosed only on or after discharge (in particular in the early part of the outbreak before the virus was identified and diagnostic tests developed), some presented late in the course of the outbreak with atypical symptoms (such as diarrhoea), while some physicians did not believe in administering corticosteroid in this unknown disease. All baseline characteristics and clinical parameters on admission were statistically different among the groups (Table 2 ). In particular, Group P consisted of the youngest patients with the largest number of health care workers (47%) and the mildest disease on admission, as evidenced by the lowest median CXR score, normal respiratory status and absence of ARDS. Group MP had the highest median CXR score on admission. The two groups with the highest prevalence of ARDS on admission (8.3% and 8.2% for Groups Pulse and No Steroid, respectively) also had the highest mortality rates (30% and 28.3%, respectively). Overall, crude death rates were lowest for Group P and Group MP. Table 3aec shows the details of 1188 patients who had received corticosteroids. Table 3a shows that general characteristics were significantly different amongst the groups. Steroid commencement was earliest in Group HC and latest in Group Pulse [median Days 4 (IQR 3e6) and 6 (IQR 4e8), respectively, after symptom onset]. Among the groups, Group MP had the lowest proportion of patients requiring pulsed corticosteroid rescue (41% compared to 53e100% in the other groups), which was also given at the latest time point (median Day 9 after symptom onset, compared to Days 6e8 in the other groups). The total cumulative corticosteroid dosage was highest in Group Pulse, while duration of steroid treatment was shortest in Group P (median 15 days) and longest in Group MP (median 21 days), the latter of which was dictated by protocol. 3 Table 3b shows the patients' clinical parameters at corticosteroid commencement. Group P still had the mildest disease. Comparatively, Group MP and Group Pulse had the worst clinical status as evidenced by the highest percentages of patients with ARDS (9.4% and 18.1%, respectively) and the highest median CXR score [4 (IQR 2e7) and 5 (IQR 2e9), respectively]. Table 3c shows the clinical parameters at pulsed corticosteroid commencement. Group P consistently had the mildest disease, with the lowest median CXR score and only 12.4% of patients in either ALI or ARDS. In contrast, patients in Group MP had the worst clinical status with the highest median CXR score, with 45.9% having either ALI or ARDS.",

            "text": "These results should be interpreted with caution in the light of its limitations of being a retrospective study without control groups. Disparities of baseline characteristics could have been secondary to selection bias, i.e. the choice of corticosteroid use and dosage might have been related to severity of illness or the treatment protocols adopted by individual hospitals. We thus observed that steroid types and dosages had varied from protocol-driven low-dose prednisolone, 4 high-dose MP, 3 and even pulsed corticosteroid on commencement of treatment. 5 Although corticosteroids and ribavirin were usually given together, the effect of the latter was likely small, if any. 18e20 Predominant corticosteroid type was classified according to their use in the first four days, but subsequent use including rescue pulsed doses and the total dose and duration administered could also have confounded the final conclusion. We believe that the cytokine storm in the initial days of the SARS illness has the most critical effect on the manifestations of the disease 8, 21 and that an appropriate level of immunomodulation at this stage may have the most impact on the subsequent course of the illness. 8, 22 We have therefore arbitrarily classified our patients as described, which was also the most reasonable since the majority of patients given corticosteroid (1188, or 97.9%) could be classified. Also, PaO 2 and FiO 2 could only be estimated in most instances based on assumptions, nevertheless, the same rules were applied to every patient. Finally, while we have already excluded patients with experimental therapy (especially antivirals like lopinavir/ritonavir which may have beneficial effects 23 ) and those with 'do not resuscitate' orders, it is still possible for the outcome to be affected by different modes of subsequent management, including the choice of ventilatory strategy. Our results suggest that SARS patients given prednisolone and methylprednisolone had fared better than those given hydrocortisone. We speculate that this may be related to the comparatively higher anti-inflammatory potency of the former two drugs as demonstrated in in vitro studies. 24, 25 We observed that corticosteroid dosages employed for SARS in Hong Kong had been diverse, ranging from low dose regimens 4, 26 through dosages commonly employed in treating acute asthmatic attacks 1,6,27 and higher dosages triggered by surrogate markers of clinical deterioration, 3, 28 to pulsed MP dosages for treatment of acute autoimmune pulmonary vasculitis. 5 At first sight, it does appear intriguing that both lowdose (P) and high-dose (MP) groups should result in similarly low mortality rates in our study. On detailed analysis, however, it appeared that dosages had been tailored in accordance with disease severity: Group P (prednisolone) with the mildest clinical and radiographic parameters had received lower dosages of corticosteroid on steroid commencement, whereas Group MP with worse clinical status received higher initial dosages. The relative good outcomes of MP and P groups could be related to their lower cumulative doses compared to Groups HC and Pulse and hence more modest immunosuppressive effects. However, it must be pointed out that Group P had the mildest disease throughout hospital stay while Group MP had much more severe illness. Hence low cumulative dosages should not be the major reason for the better outcomes of these two groups. We speculate, therefore, that corticosteroid administered at dosages commensurate to disease severity may be conducive to effectively controlling immunopathological lung damage. In addition, our data do not support the contention that higher corticosteroids dosages as treatment for SARS would necessarily lead to an infection-prone immunocompromised state, because the high-dose protocol-driven 3 Group MP (methylprednisolone) had higher (worse) median CXR score on corticosteroid commencement but displayed low mortality rate and the lowest proportionate requirement for pulsed MP rescue. It also turned out to have consistently lower rates of positive bacterial and fungal cultures as well as anti-fungal treatment. That high dose methylprednisolone was more beneficial than no or lower dosages of corticosteroid has also been shown in a comparative study from mainland China. 29 As only two hospitals had used specific treatment protocols throughout the outbreak, while the other 12 had applied different regimens to different patients at different phases of the outbreak, definite conclusions about the effects of corticosteroids are difficult even though we have adjusted for most baseline differences using multivariate analysis.",

These included: as soon as the diagnosis of SARS was made and without response to antibiotics treatment within 48 h; 1 on confirming an epidemiological link or contact history; 5, 30 or on finding lung involvement on high-resolution CT thorax alone despite clear chest radiographs. 5, 6, 30 Such early corticosteroid administration strategies might have led to the drug being given too early in the viral replicative phase, which may result in aggravation and/or prolongation of viral replication and thus less satisfactory outcome. 5,6,30e32 We therefore submit that the low mortality and morbidity in Group MP may have resulted from effective control of severe disease by appropriately high dosages of corticosteroid with high anti-inflammatory activity given at a strategic timing as per protocol 3 to coincide with the period of high SARS-related immunopathological activity. This strategy would allow the smooth tailing down of corticosteroid dosages to avoid disease rebound as well as the risk of secondary infections during the subsequent phase of immunoparesis. 3, 28 In contrast, Group HC, which also received high cumulative corticosteroid dosages and had high proportions of patients requiring pulsed MP rescue, displayed the highest positivity for bacterial, fungal and tuberculosis infections. We postulate that comparatively weaker anti-inflammatory effects of hydrocortisone 24, 25 in these groups might have resulted in incomplete control of SARS and thus persistent elevation of cytokines at an earlier stage, which in turn may promote bacterial proliferation. 7, 33 In the same context, high cumulative corticosteroid dosages in the later stages of hospitalisation resulting from increased need for rescue dosages could also have contributed to excessive secondary infections among patients receiving hydrocortisone. Cytokine assays have not been specifically performed for the purpose of this study.",
