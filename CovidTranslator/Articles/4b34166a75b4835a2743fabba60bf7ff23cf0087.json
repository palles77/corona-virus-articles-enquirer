For the prevention of airborne infections, many HCWs in hospitals have been fit tested for respirator use as a part of respiratory protection programs since 2003. [2, 3] The main purpose of fit testing is to ensure that the respirator being used by the individual forms a tight enough seal to adequately protect the person from unwanted airborne hazard exposures. Although the relative risk for adverse effects of fit testing using denatonium benzoate is low, the absolute number of workers with adverse reactions may nevertheless be sizeable.

            "text": "A 34-year-old female nurse worked at a regional hospital for 3 years before hospitalization with severe asthma. She was healthy prior to the assignment to join the respirator fit testing program at 5 PM on October 13, 2017. She had a history of allergy to shrimp, crab, mite, and disinfecting products (contain quaternary ammonium). Skin rash and itching were noted when she contacted disinfectants (containing quaternary ammonium). She had no family history of asthma. She denied previous major illness or abuse of alcohol and drugs, including over-the-counter medications. She rapidly developed shortness of breath, cough, and agitation after the 1st part of the respirator fit test. Respirator fit testing was performed using the 3M Fit Test Kit FT-31 (3M Canada Company, Ontario, Canada) (denatonium benzoate solution). [4] In the procedure for the respirator fit testing program, [5] the 1st part of the test is to screen the ability of the examinee to detect (taste) aerosolized droplets of a dilute solution of denatonium benzoate; then the examinee wears the respirator for the 2nd part of the test, and a more concentrated solution of the denatonium benzoate is sprayed into the hood while the individual performs a set of actions. The test criterion of the respirator fit test is the failure to taste the denatonium benzoate by the examinee. [4, 6] Upon physical examination, she appeared dyspneic. A few scattered rales and wheezing sounds were heard upon examination of the lungs. The heart was of normal size with a heart rate of 119 beats/min and a regular sinus rhythm, her blood pressure was 167/110 mm Hg, her respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min and her temperature was 36.6\u00b0C. The abdomen was soft. The liver and spleen were not palpable. An electrocardiogram revealed a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 78 beats/min. The echocardiogram showed fatty liver and gallstones, with no heart dysfunction. A chest roentgenogram revealed negative findings: forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ; observed/predicted = 1.60/2.64 L), forced vital capacity (FVC; observed/predicted = 2.34/3.00 L), FEV 1 /FVC (68%), and FVC (78%), indicating obstructive lung function. Multiple blood cultures were negative. No parasite ova were found in stool specimens. Other relevant laboratory investigations are summarized in Table 1 . Serial spirometry tests were conducted on December 11, 2017 (FEV 1 = 2.11/2.64 L, FVC = 2.34/3.02 L, FEV 1 /FVC = 91%) and January 15, 2018 (FEV 1 = 2.12/2.65 L, FVC = 2.34/3.00 L, FEV 1 /FVC = 91%).",

            "text": "Taste is one of the senses through which humans and other animals perceive their environment. [6] The taste function is multidimensional. Qualitatively, the primary taste is bitter, a sensation that comes from specific chemicals that are detected by specialized receptors in the tongue, as well as other parts of the oral cavity. However, when most people refer to taste, they actually imply flavor. [6, 8] Flavors can be considered the perceptual integration of signals from the gustatory, olfactory, and trigeminal systems. [8] Denatonium benzoate is a quaternary ammonium compound that has been used as a denaturant since 1960. [9, 10] Denatonium benzoate is a very bitter substance and is detected by taste at a dilution of 1 part per 20 million parts water. [9, 10] The expression of the bitter taste receptor (TAS2Rs) on human airway smooth muscle (ASM) is considered an avoidance receptor for inhalants that, when activated, leads to ASM contraction and bronchospasm. [11] Adverse reactions related to denatonium benzoate are rare. A previous report [10] revealed a case with a severe allergic reaction, Table 1 Findings of the laboratory investigation of the asthma patient. including urticaria and asthma, resulting from exposure to denatonium benzoate. Another study [3] in Canada presented several cases related to the use of denatonium benzoate for respirator fit testing. Among them, the reactions of several cases were likely due to an irritant effect; others were more consistent with angioedema and asthmatic episodes; and some of the adverse effects may have been more psychologic than toxicologic in nature. Individual susceptibility to denatonium benzoate may play a role in adverse reactions. [3, 11] Previous studies have shown an association between disinfectants and asthma. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] The disinfectants, quaternary ammonium compounds (such as benzalkonium chloride), amine compounds, and fragrances are the main sensitizers presented in cleaning products. Bleach (sodium hypochlorite), hydrochloric acid, and alkaline agents (ammonia and sodium hydroxide), which are commonly mixed together, are considered the strongest airway irritants in cleaning products. [11, 12, 13, 15] Exposure to the ingredients of cleaning products may give rise to both new-onset asthma, with or without a latency period, and workexacerbated asthma. [12, 13] Although it has been indicated that in many workers, respiratory tract symptoms induced by chemicals and fragrances cannot be explained by allergic or asthmatic reactions, these patients may have hyperactivity to inhaled irritants, which is known to reflect sensory reactivity. [12] [13] [14] Our case had a higher level of IgE (516.3 IU/mL). It is likely a reflection of atopic features that already result from a known history of allergy to disinfectants. Similar to previous studies, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] the clinical presentations of this case may be due to an asthma exacerbation through exposure to irritants or sensitization to denatonium benzoate.",
