In swine, colostrum ingestion 59 is essential for postnatal piglet survival, growth, and development because it provides immunity, 60 nutrients, energy, and bioactive factors [1, 2] . The window of opportunity for milk-borne bioactive 61 factors to influence neonate development is limited, and primarily occurs prior to closure of tight 62 junctions between cells lining the piglet's gut. Closure of the gut occurs by 48 h postnatal [3] . 63 During the first 48 h postnatal, piglets ingest up to 30% of their body weight in milk [4] . This time-64 period is a critical developmental period for the gilt reproductive system, including the formation 65 of uterine glands, otherwise known as adenogenesis [5, 6] . Colostrum ingestion significantly 66 affected the developmental trajectory of uterine tissue [7] [8] [9] [10] . Replacement gilts with less 67 colostrum consumption than littermates as indicated by blood immunocrit values had reduced litter 68 sizes relative to other sows [11, 12] . Colostrum-deprivation also resulted in significantly different 69 patterns of uterine gene and protein expression [13] .",

We 75 previously proposed that since the vagina is embryologically related to the uterus [14] , its 76 postnatal developmental trajectory may also be responsive to early nutritional environment. 77 Moreover, we proposed that using vaginal swabs to non-invasively sample lower reproductive 78 tract may serve as a means to evaluate differences in nutritional exposures on gilt development. 79 Using a biomarker-discovery technique known as multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) profiling, .

Lipids are bioactive 368 molecules, and play a central role in metabolism and influence and modulate cell function. For 369 example, lipids from the diet function in cytokine and (steroid) hormone synthesis, cell 370 differentiation and growth, cell membrane structure, myelination, signal transmission, and are 371 substrates used for prostaglandin synthesis. Fatty acids and their metabolites, such as eicosanoids, 372 have a major signaling function and regulate gene transcription by serving as transcriptional co-373 activators, with polyunsaturated fatty acids activating the transcription factor peroxisome 374 proliferator-activated receptors [26, 27]. Thus, fatty acid composition of diet has the potential to 375 affect significant biological response in the neonate, which in turn can affect the course of neonatal 376 development and health.

Thus 384 this period of time may be viewed as either a window of opportunity or vulnerability for 385 influencing neonate's developmental program. 386 387 Functional groups of Screening Phase II Method 2 analysis were primarily glycerol lipids with 388 both saturated and unsaturated FA residues. Of the most discriminatory lipids, four MRMs had 389 AUC values between 0.7 and 0.8, thus achieving a biomarker utility rating of fair [25]. Two of 390 these were glycerol lipids with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) residues, one was a ceramide, and the 391 final was a cholesteryl ester. Mean intensity of the cholesteryl ester was significantly higher in 392 suckled plus fat supplemented gilts versus non-supplemented gilts. Unfortunately, MRM-profiling 393was not completed with the fat supplement. Thus we can only speculate that the higher cholesteryl 394 ester content in swabs was a response to the higher fat diet. Two glycerol lipids with EPA residues 395 and ceramide were numerically lower in vaginal swabs of fat supplemented gilts. EPA is either 396 absorbed from the diet or synthesized from the essential fatty acids linoleic and alpha linoleic acid.397A potential explanation of these findings is that direct supplementation of piglets with animal fats 398 lowered the bioavailability of EPA (or linoleic and alpha linoleic acids). In the mature gut,399 triglycerides and phospholipids are hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase, but the ethyl ester of EPA 400 requires additional digestion with bile salt-dependent lipase [32]. Digestion and absorption of 401 EPA is thus considerably lower than triglycerides and phospholipids, and dependent on high-fat meals, which stimulates bile-salt dependent lipase and enhanced absorption [32]. In 403 porcine and human neonates the levels of pancreatic lipase and bile acids are much lower than at 404 maturity [33]. Thus, despite the higher lipid content of fat supplement treated gilts, the low 405 availability of bile acids levels may have limited EPA absorption. Further research into how lipids 406 ingested by early postnatal gilts are metabolized and used in the reproductive tract is needed. lipidomes were significantly affected by composition of early postnatal diet. 410 Multiple lipid molecules were differentially abundant between gilts exposed to colostrum versus 411 gilts fed milk replacer and gilts fed with and without fat supplement the first 48 h of life. Several 412 lipids collected from vaginal swabs were highly correlated with the nutrition source a piglet 413 ingested. Lipids more abundant in milk replacer appeared to be driving the association in the 414 current study. These findings demonstrated that lipid composition of neonatal diet affects tissue 415 composition and thus may affect development, function and overall health and fertility. 416 Moreover, while data support the efficacy of using MRM-lipid profiling of vaginal swabs to 417 detect differences in early postnatal nutritional exposures, findings also highlight a need to 418 modify our approach to determine if biomarkers of colostrum intake can be specifically 419 identified in vaginal swab samples.",
