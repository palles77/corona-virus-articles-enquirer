The aim of this study was to characterize the subset(s) of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) expanding during active celiac disease to provide insights into the mechanisms involved in their expansion. Methods: Flow-cytometric analysis of isolated IELs and/or immunohistochemical staining of frozen sections were performed in 51 celiac patients and 50 controls with a panel of monoclonal antibodies against T-cell and natural killer (NK) receptors. In addition, in vitro studies were performed to identify candidate stimuli for NK receptor expression. Results: In normal intestine, different proportions of IELs, which were mainly T cells, expressed the NK receptors CD94/ NKG2, NKR-P1A, KIR2D/3D, NKp46, Pen5, or CD56. During the active phase of celiac disease, the frequency of CD94 \u0609 IELs, which were mostly \u2423\u2424 T cells, was conspicuously increased over controls. In contrast, the expression of other NK markers was not modified. Furthermore, expression of CD94 could be selectively induced in vitro by T-cell receptor activation and/or interleukin 15, a cytokine produced by intestinal epithelial cells. Conclusions: The gut epithelium favors the development of T cells that express NK receptors. In active celiac disease, there is a specific and selective increase of IELs expressing CD94, the HLA-E-specific NK receptor that may be related to T-cell receptor activation and/or interleukin 15 secretion.",

It does not appear, as previously suggested, 4 that the expansion of the intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) population is a nonspecific reaction to the underlying inflammatory process, because IELs are not significantly increased in Crohn's disease 10 and they are moderately expanded in autoimmune enteropathy of childhood, a disease with a strong inflammatory reaction in the lamina propria and a subtotal to total villous atrophy. 11 In contrast, celiac disease-associated IEL infiltration seems to be of particular significance. It is detected as early as 12 hours after oral or rectal gluten challenge in patients receiving a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD) and precedes the onset of epithelial lesions. 12, 13 Furthermore, IELs can undergo malignant transformation during the course of 2 rare but severe complications of celiac disease: enteropathyassociated T-cell lymphomas 14 and refractory sprue. 15 These complications, which are not observed in other inflammatory bowel diseases, support the idea that celiac disease IELs are permanently submitted to stimuli that promote their expansion and ultimately may favor their transformation. Altogether, these observations underline the importance of understanding the mechanism(s) that drives the expansion of IELs and their role in the pathogenesis of the epithelial lesions.",

[21] [22] [23] [24] These IELs may respond to modifications of ECs, as suggested by their natural cytotoxicity against corona virus-infected cells in mice 25, 26 or against EC tumors in humans. 27, 28 In mice, in which they have been extensively characterized, they constitute a fraction of both TCR\u2423\u2424 \u03e9 and TCR\u2425\u2426 \u03e9 IELs and express a CD8\u2423 \u03e9 \u2424 \u03e9 CD4 \u03ea or CD8\u2423 \u03ea \u2424 \u03ea CD4 \u03ea phenotype (reviewed by Rocha et al. 29 ). Studies in humans have also identified the presence of IELs expressing NK receptors. CD56 and CD94 were found on both CD3-positive and -negative cells, whereas CD16 expression was mainly restricted to CD3-negative cells. 21, 22, 24 The proportion of NK-like cells decreased in one study of active celiac disease, 24 whereas another study suggested that the disappearance of CD16 \u03e9 granular IELs was associated with a more severe and persistent disease. 21 With the idea in mind that NK receptors may play an important role in the interactions between IELs and ECs in the normal or diseased human intestine, we used a panel of antibodies against NK receptors to characterize the surface phenotype of IELs in normal subjects and patients with celiac disease. We found that a significant proportion of normal human T-IELs (IELs expressing TCR) expressed one or several NK receptors. Remarkably, most of the TCR\u2423\u2424 \u03e9 IELs that expanded in active celiac disease consistently and selectively expressed CD94, the HLA-E-specific NK receptor. [30] [31] [32] In contrast, there was no change in the proportion of IELs expressing NK receptors that bind classical MHC class I molecules or other ligands unrelated to MHC molecules. Furthermore, the increase in CD94 \u03e9 IELs was specific of active celiac disease because it was not observed in various other inflammatory diseases and it subsided under GFD. Finally, in vitro studies with isolated IELs identified interleukin (IL)-15, a cytokine secreted by intestinal ECs, 33 as a likely candidate for inducing CD94 expression. Altogether these findings suggest that the CD94/ HLA-E and IL-15R/IL-15 receptor/ligand pairs may control the expansion and/or function of IELs in celiac disease.",

            "text": "Previous studies indicated that CD94 could be induced on PBLs, but that induction required the prolonged combination of TCR engagement and exposure to IL-15. 50 This led us to examine the effect of TCR stimulation and IL-15, alone or in combination, on CD94 expression by IELs. IELs were isolated from histologically normal surgical samples, and CD94-negative cells were further purified by cell sorting. CD94-negative IELs, which included 90%-95% TCR\u2423\u2424 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 cells, were stimulated during a short period of time, 18-36 hours, with anti-CD3 antibodies and/or IL-15 before multicolor flow-cytometric analysis using anti-CD8 and CD94. Figure 6 shows that IL-15 alone, or TCR stimulation alone, rapidly and selectively induced CD94 on up to 40%-50% of IELs, whereas less than 10% of unstimulated cells induced CD94. Induction of CD94 was detected as early as 18 hours after culture and is shown at 24 hours. The prompt and important increase in the frequency of CD94 expression, in the absence of changes in cell recovery (data not shown), rules out the possibility of selective expansion or survival of a minor subset of CD94 \u03e9 contaminants among the FACS-purified cells. Adding anti-CD3 antibody did not significantly enhance the effect of IL-15 in 6 separate experiments. In contrast, expression of CD56 and CD16 was consistently unaffected (data not shown). In addition, within a time frame ranging from 18 to 36 hours in 3 different experiments, IFN-\u2425 had little effect on CD94 expression, and other cytokines that may be present in normal and/ or inflammatory intestine, IL-12, TNF-\u2423, and transforming growth factor \u2424, had no detectable effect alone or in combination with TCR stimulation. We confirmed in 3 separate experiments that, within this time frame, neither IL-15 alone nor the combination of IL-15 and TCR stimulation induced CD94 on CD8-high PBLs (which include 98% TCR\u2423\u2424 \u03e9 ), as previously reported. 50 Furthermore, we showed that even the minor subset of CD45RO \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 PBLs that may be functionally closer to IELs than CD45RO \u03ea CD8 \u03e9 PBLs displayed little induction of CD94 (5%-7%) ( Figure 6 ). Thus, in marked contrast with both RO \u03e9 and RO \u03ea CD8 \u03e9 PBLs, a large fraction of IELs promptly expressed CD94 in response to IL-15 alone and, to a lesser degree, to TCR stimulation alone. Finally, to examine whether IL-15 might play a role in the expression of CD94 by IELs in celiac disease, we examined the presence of IL-15 in intestinal tissue sections. The IL-15 protein was mainly detected in ECs of the villi in the normal intestine and was strongly expressed by crypt and villi ECs as well as by numerous lamina propria cells in active celiac disease (Figure 7 ).",

The results showed that IELs and PBLs markedly differed in the frequency of T cells expressing NK receptors as well as in the nature of the NK receptors expressed. Thus, more than 60% of T-IELs vs. only 20%-30% of T-PBLs expressed at least 1 NK receptor. NKR-P1A was expressed on a much larger subset of T-IELs than T-PBLs, and Pen5 and NKp46 were expressed by a subset of T-IELs but not by T-PBLs. Conversely, CD57 was expressed by a subset of T-PBLs but not by T-IELs. These NK receptor-expressing T-IELs, or a subset of them, might be the counterpart to the mouse NK receptor-expressing T-IELs, which are thought to differentiate in the gut wall and expand in response to self antigens. 29, 61, 62 Alternatively, the expression of NK receptors on human T-IELs could be the consequence of particular activation events. In any case, our data suggest that the gut epithelium is a unique environment that favors the differentiation and/or expansion of particular subsets of NK receptor-expressing T cells in humans as well as in mice. Some NK receptors, such as CD16, endow T-IELs with NK-like properties 23 that may contribute to the innate defense of the intestinal epithelium. [25] [26] [27] [28] Other NK receptors, such as CD94, [63] [64] [65] function as regulators of TCR-mediated signaling by modulating the activation threshold of the TCR. Accordingly, our recent studies of T-cell clones derived from CD8 \u03e9 TCR\u2423\u2424 \u03e9 IELs indicate that CD94 can modulate TCR-mediated cytotoxicity (unpublished data, Bana Jabri and Nadine Cerf-Bensussan, January 1999). These functional properties may profoundly influence the outcome of the local immune responses, and it is therefore of particular significance that distinct patterns of NK receptors may be expressed in particular types of inflammatory processes of the intestine.",

In this context, it was important to further characterize the nature of the expanding cells, particularly with respect to their pattern of NK receptor expression, because NK receptors may regulate the interactions of IELs with the altered epithelium of celiac patients. Our results indicated that active celiac disease is associated with a striking increase in CD8 \u03e9 TCR\u2423\u2424 \u03e9 IELs expressing the CD94 NK receptor.

            "text": "A remarkable finding of this study was that the induction of NK receptors seemed to be a selective process because CD94 was the only NK receptor tested whose expression was markedly increased in active celiac disease. This observation suggested that induction of CD94 could be dissociated from that of other NK receptors in vivo. Our in vitro studies further confirmed that CD94 induction was selective because CD94, but not the other NK receptors tested (such as CD16 and CD56, data not shown), could be induced on CD8 \u03e9 T-IELs upon TCR and IL-15 stimulation. A selective induction of CD94 upon treatment with anti-TCR and IL-15 was also recently reported for PBLs. 50 However, there seem to be some interesting differences between the response of PBLs and IELs to these stimuli. CD94 expression by PBLs required the combined stimulation by anti-TCR and IL-15 over a period of 4-6 days, 50 but IELs expressed CD94 as early as 18 hours after stimulation with IL-15 alone, and, to a lesser degree, with TCR stimulation alone. This unusual property of IELs was not shared by the minor subset of CD45RO \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 PBLs, which is functionally closer to IELs than the bulk of PBLs, suggesting that the ability to rapidly induce CD94 upon exposure to IL-15 is not a common feature of memory CD8 \u03e9 T cells. A possible explanation for these differences is that, by prior exposure to antigens in the gut microenvironment, T-IELs were ''primed'' for CD94 induction. Our in vitro studies further indicated that cytokine-mediated induction of CD94 was the restricted property of IL-15 because other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12, IFN-\u2425, and TNF-\u2423 consistently failed to induce high levels of CD94. IL-15 can be secreted by the intestinal epithelium 33 and is a potent activator of human IELs, stimulating their proliferation, cytotoxicity, and IFN-\u2425 secretion. 67 In addition, IL-15 favors migration of lymphocytes 68 and induces expression of several chemokines and chemokine receptors on lymphocytes. 69 Altogether, these findings suggest a scenario whereby after TCR-mediated activation and exposure to the cytokines of the epithelial microenvironment, including IL-15, celiac disease IELs not only up-regulate CD94 expression, but also increase their cytotoxic properties through the induction of perforin and granzyme B. 70 Our finding that IL-15 is abundant in the intestinal epithelium of celiac disease is consistent with this scenario. The local events leading to TCR engagement remain to be elucidated. One could speculate that celiac disease IELs recognize as yet undefined antigens induced on the intestinal epithelium in response to gliadin. Such a mode of response to stress has recently been suggested for TCR\u2425\u2426 \u03e9 IELs using the variable V\u24261 region, a subset of IELs known to be increased in celiac disease 5, 17, 18 and that respond to the stress-induced MICA/MICB HLA molecules. 19 The selective induction of CD94 expression by celiac disease IELs also points to a specific function of the CD94 receptor and its ligand, the nonpolymorphic MHC class I molecule HLA-E, 31, 32, 48 in the immune processes associated with celiac disease. Although the surface expression of HLA-E on intestinal cells has not yet been shown with the available reagents, significant levels of messenger RNA have been reported. 71 Furthermore, we found constitutive membrane expression of HLA-E and marked up-regulation by various cytokines, including IFN-\u2425, on intestinal EC lines such as HT29 colonic cells ( Figure 5 and data not shown).",

We show that IL-15, which is expressed by intestinal ECs, or TCR engagement can selectively induce CD94 on IELs. These findings suggest a scenario whereby IELs primed in the celiac disease microenvironment may be locally regulated positively or negatively by IL-15 and HLA-E. Thus, EC injury and the resulting intestinal dysfunction in celiac disease may not only depend on the activation of gliadin-specific, DQ2-,",
