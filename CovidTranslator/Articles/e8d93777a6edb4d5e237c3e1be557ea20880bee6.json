            "text": "Gastrointestinal infections can occur sporadically or as a result of an epidemic. Many pathogens have been associated with neonatal diarrhea ( Table 1) . Neonates can acquire bacteria or enteric viruses during the first days of life by vertical or horizontal transmission. Organisms are ingested at the time of birth during passage through the birth canal and across the perineum, which has been shown for infections with enteroviruses and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) . 8 , 17 , 76 , 84 Of stool cultures obtained from women at delivery, 10% to 15% of them carry EPEC. 17 , 45 , 91 , 99 Many of these mothers transmit these organisms to their infants, resulting in an asymptomatic infection rate of 2% to 5% among newborns randomly cultured during nursery surveys. 17 ,s 4 , 91 Bacteria and viruses can be horizontally transmitted from siblings, parents, or hospital personnel or through ingestation of contaminated formulas or water. Maternal or other asymptomatic carriers of Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, EPEC, and other viral pathogens can spread these pathogens. In one outbreak investigation of echovirus 11', mouth care and gavage feeding were substantially associated with neonatal infection. 58 Sometimes the presence of a particular pathogen, such as rotavirus, can be endemic to a specific nursery and not have the characteristic seasonal variation. 14,20,44,so,10s, 106 Nursery outbreaks have been associated with many enteric viruses and bacteria. In most outbreak investigations, several illnesses occur among the infants and sometimes among the nursery staff. 39 , 93 Often the initiation of a nursery outbreak involves an asymptomatic infant who sheds the virus or bacteria. These infants can infect other infants in the nursery or the nursery staff. For some viral pathogens such as enteroviruses, nursery outbreaks usually coincide with seasonal peaks of disease in the community. Reported outbreaks have been due primarily to echovirus 11 or group B coxsackievirus serotypes 1 to 5, with attack rates in the nursery as high as 50%.77",

Entry into the mucosal cell is achieved when the lysosomal membrane ruptures. Neighboring mucosa! and submucosal cells are subsequently invaded by bacterial-induced pseudopods, followed again by pinocytosis, vacuole lysis, and intracytoplasmic release of bacteria. Each of these intricate steps in invasion and spread depend on the complex interaction of several bacterial gene products and regulatory elements. Together these events cause enterocyte necrosis and host inflammation, manifest by shallow ulcers with exudate that appear as infectious colitis, often characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and mucus, blood, and inflammatory cells in the stool. 52 Colonic perforation and peritonitis have been reported in neonates. 52 Despite the direct mucosal invasion, extraintestinal spread by Shigella is seen in only a few patients. 27 , 52 A watery diarrhea phase often precedes the inflammatory phase of Shigella spp. infection, implying the presence of an enterotoxin.

Although the pathogenic lesions associated with enteric adenovirus infection have not been studied extensively in humans, investigations in animals have contributed to descriptions of intestinal injury with these viruses. 51 Adenoviruses appear to infect gut enterocytes, as shown by intranuclear inclusions, immunoperoxidase staining, and direct visualization of virus particles by electron microscopic examination. This infection causes infected enterocytes to rupture and development of villus stunting and crypt cell hypertrophy. A host mononuclear cell response is observed with infiltration of villous lamina propria. Experimental astrovirus infection of animals has indicated species-specific differences in pathologic mechanisms, and it is not clear how these differences relate to human infection.st In lambs, astroviruses infect mature enterocytes, and exfoliation of these cells causes stunted villi and crypt hypertrophy. Infection in calves involves M cells and enterocytes on dome villi. Host neutrophil response may be detected in dome villi lamina propria.",

Often milk feedings are temporarily stopped to allow for \"gut rest\" while oral rehydration or parenteral solutions with appropriate electrolytes are administered. The infant should be examined and weighed frequently so proper rehydration and prevention of complications are ensured. If associated vomiting occurs, a nasogastric tube may be used to decompress the gut. Any infant with diarrhea should be isolated from other infants in the nursery and strict infection control measures must be instituted.",

Because of the frequency of associated sepsis, broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin and gentamicin are started. Vancomycin may be an alternative to ampicillin to treat gram-positive in infants who have been hospitalized for some time, when there may be concern for resistent gram-positive organisms. If perforation is suspected, dindamycin may be added to the antibiotic regimen to treat anaerobic bacteria. 6 \u2022 7 , 92 However, the one randomized, controlled trial of ampidllin and gentamicin plus dindamycin compared with ampicillin and gentamicin alone in infants with NEC 31 showed that dindamycin did not reduce the incidence of bowel necrosis and was associated with an increase in late-onset strictures. Finally, if sepsis is documented, that is a positive blood culture is obtained, antibiotics should be changed according to sus-ceptibility of the organism. Traditionally clinicians administer parenteral antibiotics and withhold enteral feeding for 10 to 14 days. When and how to initiate feeding in the full-term and preterm infant is controversial. 13 , 45 , 74 Many low birthweight infants have multiple episodes of \"NEC scares,\" have oral feedings withheld with each one, and are often started on antibiotics and parenteral nutrition. Long-term use of parenteral nutrition has been associated with complications, such as metabolic bone disease, sepsis, and cholestatic jaundice, and does little to support the function of the gastrointestinal tract. 73 In animals and human studies, enteral feedings are necessary to maintain normal gastrointestinal structure, integrity, and hormonal function. 28 , 45 , 67 , 69 Further studies are needed to determine when and how to initiate enteral feedings in these young infants.",

Several studies have addressed the role of intravenous gammaglobulin to prevent nosocomial infection and NEC in low birthweight and full-term infants, with little emphasis on gastrointestinal disease. 2 , 32 , 59 The results from these studies are contradictory, and only one of them addressed gastrointestinal illness in full-term and preterm infants. 59 It showed that administration of intravenous immunoglobulin had no substantial effect. In another study, an intramuscular immunoglobulin preparation or placebo given with each feeding during the first week of life to 75 low-birth-weight infants in a nursery with endemic rotavirus was associated with delayed excretion of rotavirus and milder symptoms of infection. 3 The results of these immunoglobulin clinical trials have been disappointing because the risk of systemic bacterial infection, NEC, and gastroenteritis are important problems for hospitalized, high-risk neonates. Other more specific therapies have been suggested, such as use of an oral immunoglobulin preparation to prevent NEC. 29 Eibl and coworkers 29 performed a randomized clinical trial of use of an oral immunoglobulin preparation (73% IgA and 26% IgG) to prevent NEC in infants who weighed between 800 and 2000 g at birth. No cases of NEC occurred among the 88 infants receiving the oral IgA-IgG compared with six cases of NEC that occurred among 91 control infants.",

The protective effects of breast milk are most striking in communities with poor sanitation, poverty, and malnutrition, where infant morbidity and mortality rates are high. 15 , 41 , 46 , 71 Breast-feeding decreases gastroenteritis by providing to other foods and water that may It been shown to be protective against NEC in premature 70 The importance of breast-feeding to prevent diarrheal disease in preterm and full-term infants has been well established, and promotion of breastfeeding for these infants should be the responsibility of health professionals. 38 Many bacterial and viral pathogens have been associated with enteric disease during the newborn period. These pathogens have widely different mechanisms on the intestinal epithelium and are associated with many clinical findings. Infected infants can be asymptomatic, have gastroenteritis, or have fulminant sepsis. Physicians must recognize the clinical syndrome and interpret the laboratory results properly to determine therapy and institute appropriate infection-control measures. All of these principles can be applied to premature infants in the neonatal intensive care nursery and to full-term infants at home in the community.",
