The virus affects most members of the family Felidae, causing enteritis and bone marrow hypoplasia that results in severe leukopenia. The virus infects kittens in utero and postnatally causes cerebellar hypoplasia and ataxia (Kilham and Margolis, 1966) .",

Filtrates from these tissue suspensions were treated with chemical inactivants such as formalin. Two inoculations of this type of vaccine produced longlasting protection (Leasure et al., 1934; Enders and Hammond, 1940) . However, subsequent vaccines, produced in primary feline kidney cell culture and inactivated with formalin, proved safer and more effective (Bittle et al., 1970; Davis et al., 1970 ). An attenuated live-virus vaccine was also very effective in inducing immunity and protection (Slater and Kucera, 1966) . Concern for the wide-scale use of an attenuated live-virus vaccine centers on the premise that shedding may spread the virus to other species, possibly allowing the emergence of pathogenic variants in these species. Attempts to immunize cats orally with attenuated live-virus vaccines have not been successful, but intranasal aerosol application has been effective (Scott and Glauberg, 1975; Schultz et al., 1973) .",

This produced a local infection and a solid systemic immunity. The use of fully virulent virus caused occasional outbreaks of disease, particularly when the scarification was not properly done or insufficient virus was present, and birds did not become immune. The virus was propagated on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated eggs by Burnet (1934) , and this became a source of vaccine material. Other methods of vaccination involved intranasal instillation (Benton et al., 1958) and feeding in drinking water (Zamberg et al., 1971) . Attenuated strains of LTV have been developed by serial passage in cell culture (Gelenczei and Marty, 1964) and by feather follicle passage (Molgard and Cavett, 1947) . Attenuated strains isolated from outbreaks or selected from passage are now used in preference to virulent virus.",

The disease is usually selflimiting, but in 5-10% of patients the infection becomes chronic, with the virus persisting in a carrier state. There are over 200 million chronic carriers of this virus worldwide. A late sequela in chronic carriers is hepatocellular carcinoma.

They also showed that this inactivated serum given parenterally could protect subjects exposed to virulent hepatitis \u0392 virus. This led to the use of plasma from infected but healthy virus carriers as the source of antigen. Carriers produce large quantities of the hepatitis \u0392 virus, along with its outer coat protein. By purifying and inactivating the coat protein, a safe and effective vaccine was developed (Hilleman et al., 1978) . The coat protein, naturally formed into 22-nm particles, was purified by ammonium sulfate concentration, isopycnic banding, rate zonal separation and enzymatic digestion. The purified protein particles were then inactivated with 1:4000 formalin. The particles induce good levels of protective antibody when given in a series of three injections (Symuness et al., 1980) . However, the high cost of this vaccine has limited its use. Newer vaccines produced by recombinant DNA methods are now being used, as described in other chapters. ",

Clinical signs, which vary in severity, include scouring, ulcerations of the oral cavity, and abortion. Young animals that recover often remain stunted and unproductive for long periods. BVD viral strains differ in their cytopathic effects in tissue culture; cattle infected with noncytopathogenic strains during the first 3 months of gestation can transmit the virus to the fetus, which may be born viremic and immunologically tolerant. Later exposure to cytopathogenic strains, naturally or by vaccination, can cause offspring to develop the more severe form of the disease (Bolin et al., 1985) .",

Even though the last inoculum was virulent enough to cause rabies, the earlier inoculations conferred sufficient immunity to protect the recipients. This method of producing a vaccine was successful in most instances but caused the disease occasionally and was eventually replaced by chemically inactivated vaccines prepared from infected brain tissue. Although effective, these vaccines gave rise to undesirable side-effects because they contained a myelin-related encephalitogen present in brains from mature animals.

Yet, despite their benefits, the attenuated rabies vaccines occasionally caused rabies, particularly in cats. Therefore, suckling mouse brain and tissue culture again became the substrates of choice to produce inactivated rabies virus vaccines for animals. In humans the requirement for a safe substrate is more exacting than in animals. For this reason, duck embryos proved better than brain tissue to produce rabies virus (Peck et al., 1956) . After inactivation with \u00df-propriolactone (BPL), this virus was an improved product for humans, although the allergenic effects from duck embryo tissue still present a problem. Therefore the adaptation of the PM rabies virus strain to human diploid cells and inactivation with BPL (Wiktor et al., 1964) was a further improvement. This vaccine is less reactive and more effective for pre-and post-exposure use in humans than any other yet made (Bahmanyar et al., 1976) . A similar vaccine produced in BHK cells is also beneficial in animals.",

However, cultivation of FeLV in FL 74transformed cells, followed by treatment to release viral and cell proteins, yields a vaccine that stimulates antibodies to both viral and cell membrane components.

Leptospires are transmitted through contact with the urine of animal carriers, either directly or in contaminated water or soil. Rodents are the primary reservoir of the bacteria which, due to its ability to synthesize urease, colonizes the renal nephron and subsequently is shed into the urine. Leptospirosis causes economically serious disease in cattle and swine by causing fetal death, abortion, and infertility. Recovery from infection with one serotype lends immunity only to that serotype. This immunity is predominantly humoral, since agglutinins (IgM) are responsible for the initial clearance of the bacteria; neutralizing antibodies (IgG) are also protective (Hanson, 1974; Negi et al., 1971) . Canine leptospirosis infections may be severe, occurring more commonly in male dogs than in females. Man is a dead-end host for leptospires; infection in man is accidental and usually related to occupational exposure.",
