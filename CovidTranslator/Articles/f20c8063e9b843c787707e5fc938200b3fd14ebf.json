In order to streamline these requests, as well as to provide guidance to all those involved in the health aspects of planning for MGs (not just those directly employed in the health services), EPR undertook the development of this document. The document was conceived as a tool to guide those responsible for the health needs of individuals attending an MG, and to help them plan their actions. Its focus is outbreak alert and response, but there are many other programmes and agencies, within and outside public health, that may be impacted by the factors associated with MGs.

Such planning typically involves multiple agencies, including: public health; emergency medical services; health care facilities and other medical system assets (e.g. medical equipment and pharmaceutical suppliers, home health agencies, and schools of medicine and nursing); security and law enforcement; and emergency management agencies. Key elements include: provision of medical care on-site at the MG venues as well as at hospitals and clinics; patient transport; surge capacity plans; preparation of responses to mass casualties, natural disasters and terrorism; and communications. A system should be in place to coordinate available medical assets and facilitate communication and outbreak response activities through a unified incident management structure.",

Moreover, planning to respond to a deliberate event should build on general health preparedness measures, because most of the public health responses required differ little from those required to deal with most naturally-occurring disease outbreaks. The salient distinction is that the likelihood of a deliberate event is not governed by natural processes. This difference is described below.

Official planning and preparation should allocate resources for the training of all public health cadres, and for periodic exercises in which an attack by a biological agent is simulated. Planning, preparation and exercises designed to test the effectiveness of the system in dealing with an event that is not deliberate will be of value for operations needed to deal with deliberate events, and vice versa. These exercises should be used to test the effectiveness of the event management system's relationships between first responders in the public health system and other agencies, including police, fire and rescue services, civil authorities, security agencies (intelligence, defence, etc.) and site operators.",
