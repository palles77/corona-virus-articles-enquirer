Initial clinical features at disease onset are fever (77-98%), dry cough (46-82%), myalgia or fatigue (11-52%) and dyspnea (3-31%) . 3 The majority of patients develop pneumonia, which can proceed in up to 20-30% of cases to respiratory failure requiring intubation and ventilatory support. In those COVID-19 patients who go on to develop pneumonia, dyspnea develops a median of 8 days after onset of illness. Radiographic abnormalities (CT or chest x-ray) consisting of ground-glass opacities and focal consolidation are seen in patients with pneumonia. Major causes of death include respiratory failure and myocardial damage due to myocarditis. Acute kidney injury, secondary infection and coagulopathy are each seen in approximately 50% of non-survivors. Mortality increases with age and in patients with underlying co-morbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, chronic lung disease, and cancer. According to a recent retrospective report from Wuhan, clinical predictors of increased mortality on multivariate analysis included advanced age, progressive organ failure and elevated D-Dimers on admission. 4 Other factors significantly associated with poor outcome on univariate analysis included elevated levels of serum ferritin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), Alanine amino transferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and highly sensitive cardiac Troponin I, as well as reduced levels of lymphocytes, Hemoglobin (Hb), Platelets and serum albumin.",

Herein we describe novel observations in relation to changes in monocyte morphology and activation status, which correlate with the prognosis and severity of COVID-19 infection and which can be readily quantified by flow cytometry with the concurrent measurement of forward scatter (FSC) and (SSC), which measure cell size and complexity, respectively. Specifically, we have identified the presence of a population of monocytes with higher FSC than normal (FSC-high) not typically seen in other types of viral infection.",

More importantly, macrophage markers CD11b, CD68, CD80, CD163, CD206 are all expressed in this population. Since CD80 is considered a marker typical of M1 polarization, and CD163 and CD206 are considered to be typical of M2 polarization, it suggests that the FSC-high population contains both M1 and M2 macrophages. To further confirm this suspicion, we performed intracellular staining to validate the expression of M1/M2-specific cytokines in the FSC-high cells. As shown in Figure 2C -D, M1-specific cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were found to be secreted, while on the other hand, the M2-specific cytokine IL-10 was also expressed by cells in the FSC-high population.

Autopsy findings from patients with COVID-19 mirror these findings. 13 Interestingly, as we confirmed, monocytes in infected patients are ACE2 positive. Since ACE2 is the receptor used by COVID-19 to gain entry to cells, this suggests the possibility that monocytes in patients with COVID-19 may be directly infected by COVID-19, leading to abortive replication and a delayed type I IFN response in these cells. 12 Indeed, the SARS-CoV virus has been found to infect monocytes, though replication was poor. 14 Infection of monocytes by SARS-CoV was associated with inflammatory activation and alterations in immune function-related gene expression. 15, 16 Inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b1, GM-CSF, IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1 can also stimulate the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages.",

            "text": "Similar to our findings, Zhou and colleagues recently reported on the presence of a significantly higher percentage of CD14 + CD16 + inflammatory monocytes in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients compared to normal healthy controls. 17, 18 They also reported that the percentage of CD14 + CD16 + monocytes was much higher in severe pulmonary syndrome patients from ICU. They also showed that these monocytes had the capability of secreting GM-CSF and similar to our findings could also secrete IL-6, which was higher in ICU patients, in association with cytokine storm. They described a model whereby an abnormal TH1 response triggers GM-CSF induced monocyte/macrophage activation leading to an increase in IL-6 producing CD14 + CD16 + monocytes, which migrate to the lungs and induce subsequent lung damage along with an inflammatory cytokine storm. This is also supported by recent data relating to single cell RNA sequencing of immune cells from bronchoalveolar lavage samples of patients with COVID-19, which provide important insights into the immune microenvironment of COVID-19 infected lungs. 19 These data show that Ficolin 1 expressing monocyte-derived macrophages, supplant fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP4) expressing alveolar macrophages as the predominant macrophage subset in the lungs of patients with ARDS. These cells are highly inflammatory and enormous chemokine producers implicated in cytokine storm. Based on these data, a pilot trial of Tociluzumab, an IL-6 receptor antibody approved for treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis as well as CAR-T associated cytokine release syndrome was recently conducted in a small number of severe COVID-19 patients with promising results. [20] [21] [22] Other treatments for cytokine storm, such as the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist Anakinra and the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors may also prove to be useful, though to date there is little or no clinical experience with these agents in treating COVID-19. [23] [24] [25] Given the central role that monocytes appear to play in COVID-19 infection it is important to recognise the limited information provided by most routine automated blood analyzers. Indeed, the contribution of monocytes to the patient's pathology may be overlooked as patients with severe disease can be monocytopenic. 5 This may well reflect migration of the inflammatory monocyte/macrophages All rights reserved.

While morphological examination of peripheral blood films revealed somewhat larger, atypical, vacuolated monocytes, these findings are not very specific. We have shown that simple assessment of FSC by flow cytometry in the context of COVID-19 infection can rapidly identify those patients with an increasing proportion of large, activated, IL-6 and TNF secreting monocytes, who have severe disease and are at greatest risk of ICU admission. In contrast, patients with a high proportion of normal monocytes have better prognosis with earlier recovery and discharge from hospital. These findings appear to be relatively specific for COVID-19 as we have not seen a similar pattern in patients with other viral illnesses, such as H1N1 influenza, HIV, or Hantaanvirus.",

After washing cells by adding 2 to 3 mL PBS and centrifuge for 5 min at 400g, the cells were resuspended in 400 \u03bc L PBS and examined by a flow cytometer (BD FACScantoTM II, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) using the FACSDiva v. 6.1 software. The data were analysed by FlowJo software (Version 7.6.1; Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). For intracellular staining, aliquot 100 \u03bc L fresh whole blood per assay tube. Then, surface marker staining was performed first as mentioned above. After lysis of red blood cells and rinse with PBS, the samples were then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin for 30 min at room temperature. After rinsing the samples with PBS, the cells were incubated with antibodies for staining intracellular molecules for 30 min. Next, the cells were washed by centrifugation in 3 mL PBS twice. Resuspended cells in 0.4 mL PBS were analyzed on the flow cytometer.To investigate the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) on monocyte/macrophage cell lines, an indirect staining was performed as following. Briefly, human monocytic cell lines THP-1 and U939, as well as murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum) and antibiotics, or high glucose DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS but without antibiotics (for RAW264.7), at 37 in a 5% CO 2 air incubator. Then, half million of log-phase cells were then collected to stain with the primary ACE antibody for 15 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cells were further stained with fluorochrome-labeled second antibody for 15 min. The washed and resuspended cells were finally analyzed on the flow cytometer.",
