It is thought to serve as a decoy for anti-EBOV antibodies. Using an in vitro model incorporating treatment of non-infected human THP-1 macrophages with recombinant EBOV sGP, this study sought to examine the impact of sGP upon key macrophage functions. Macrophage polarization and phagocytic capacity of activated macrophages were found to be unaltered by sGP treatment. However, treatment with sGP inhibited macrophage production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 while the yield of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, remained intact. Interestingly, the migratory ability of macrophages was also diminished by sGP, potentially due to a decrease in expression of CD11b, a vital macrophage integrin. Thus, EBOV sGP may operate to diminish functional contributions of non-infected macrophages to increase the potential viral dissemination.",

Depending upon the type of challenge, they can acquire relative phenotypes that better equip them to more efficiently respond to threats. Macrophages that are facing a bacterial or viral infection can assume the classical or M1-like phenotype, associated with high pro-inflammatory (IL-6, TNF\u03b1, IL-12, etc.) cytokine production, and high phagocytic capabilities. Macrophages fighting a helminth infection can assume the M2-like phenotype, which is associated with higher production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, etc.), effector molecules (Arg1, FIZZ1, YM1, etc.), and cell markers (CD206, Egr2, etc.). Macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) are early targets in EBOV pathogenesis. Once infected, these cells gain access to the blood and disseminate the virus systemically into tissues and blood vasculature [10] [11] [12] 16] . Viral invasion of endothelia and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the circulating infected macrophages and DCs lead to the development of viral hemorrhagic fever that is characteristic of EBOV infection [13] .",

Interestingly, the virus directs the synthesis and secretion of the modified glycoprotein (sGP) from these infected cells into the surrounding tissues and blood. The purpose of this maneuver may be to deter immune reactivity which could slow the replication and dissemination process rather than simply act as an anti-EBOV antibody sink. This is more likely the case during the early phases of disease prior to antibody synthesis. Given the importance of monocytes and macrophages in the early innate response to viral invaders, first we sought to examine the effect of EBOV sGP upon the activation of non-infected monocytes and macrophages. In order to test this in vitro, the human monocytic cell line, THP-1, which can be differentiated into macrophages by treatment with 200 nM PMA for three days, followed by a five-day rest, was used as a source of cells [17] . The THP-1 monocytes and macrophages were challenged with LPS for 24 h as a way to activate the cells and trigger cytokine production. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS and treated with either a low (4 \u03bcg/ml) or high (8 \u03bcg/ml) dose of sGP for 24 h. IL-6 production by monocytes was not statistically affected by either dosage of sGP (Fig. 1A) . However, the production of IL-6 by macrophages was significantly inhibited in the presence of sGP (Fig. 1B) . The low and high doses of sGP seemed to affect the activated macrophages equally; therefore, we chose to use the low dose throughout the remainder of the study. The results suggest that sGP may have a direct inhibitory effect on non-infected macrophages.",

To test whether sGP will inhibit the polarization of M1 macrophages, M0 macrophages were incubated with sGP and IFN\u03b3 simultaneously for 24 h and then washed, and stimulated with LPS to induce cytokine production. When EBOV sGP was present during the polarization of M1 macrophages, there was no significant effect on the cytokine profile that is characteristic for M1 macrophages ( Fig. 2A) . The production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF\u03b1 and IL-6, should be high for M1 macrophages as compared to resting M0 or M2 macrophages, and there was no significant change in these cytokine levels when macrophages were polarized with IFN\u03b3 in the presence of sGP. Typically, M1 macrophages produce low levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, upon stimulation with LPS and the level of the cytokine was not affected by the presence of sGP during M1 polarization ( Fig. 2A) . Interestingly, the basal level of IL-10 production by the M1 macrophages was significantly greater than that of LPS-stimulated cells. This is likely due to the ability of LPS to promote M1 macrophage functions thereby resulting in a lower IL-10 production by these stimulated cells [22] . Of note, basal production of IL-10 by sGP-cultured M1 macrophages was decreased relative to LPS-stimulated cells. Possibly sGP ligation to an unknown receptor on the macrophages resulted in activation of an adaptor protein which operated to reduce basal release of IL-10. However, activation of sGP-treated M1 macrophages resulted in restoration of IL-10 levels to that of LPS-stimulated cells.",

Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS and treated with sGP or PBS for an additional 24 h. Therefore, total incubation time from polarization to activation and supernatant harvest is 72 h.

While sGP alone did not provoke cytokine production by the macrophages, perhaps the treatment of polarized macrophages with LPS and then sGP is reducing cellular viability.

Previously activated M1 macrophages were incubated with sGP for 24 h, washed, and then placed in the apical chamber of a chemotaxis assay. The chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), or PBS was added to the basal chamber in complete media. The macrophages were allowed to migrate to the basal chamber for 24 h. Upon harvest, live cells from the basal chamber were counted by 30 s assessment of live cells from each well by flow cytometry. In Fig. 5 , the activated M1 macrophages (LPS \u2192 PBS and LPS \u2192 sGP) showed a significant increase in the percent of chemotaxis compared to inactivated M1 macrophages (PBS \u2192 PBS and PBS \u2192 sGP). The percent of chemotaxis of the activated macrophages treated with sGP was decreased compared to activated M1 macrophages incubated with PBS. The results suggest that LPS provokes migratory functions of macrophages and sGP can operate to impair migration of the activated macrophages towards MCP-1.",

Previously, it was thought that the primary role sGP served in pathogenesis was acting as a decoy molecule for antibody production [6] . In this study, we show for the first time that sGP has profound inhibitory effects upon activated macrophages that may condition the cells for susceptibility to infection by progeny virion. EBOV sGP inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, impaired chemotaxis, and downregulated integrin expression. Phagocytosis of the activated macrophages was unaffected which is consistent with recent data supporting the notion that EBOV utilizes \"apoptotic mimicry\" and the phagocytosis mechanisms to invade the macrophages [16] . Thus, our findings suggest that sGP is produced to halt activated macrophage anti-viral activities and potentially preserving the entry site for the virion. In addition, once the activated macrophages are infected, EBOV glycoprotein and viral protein-40 may operate to override sGP-mediated inhibition to restore migration and cytokine production resulting in systemic dissemination of the virus and viral hemorrhagic fever.",

This suggests an unusually high rate of viral replication that likely is accompanied by large amounts of pathogen-associated molecular patterns including the viral nucleic acids. In response, Fig. 3 . M1 and M2 macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokine production is inhibited by EBOV sGP if given after activation, but not during activation. THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophages. For the PBS, LPS, and sGP groups, macrophages were treated for 24 h with (A, C) IFN\u03b3 (20 ng/mL) or (B, D) IL-4 (20 ng/mL) and IL-13 (20 ng/mL). Subsequently, the macrophages were then stimulated with PBS, LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) or sGP (4 \u03bcg/mL) for an additional 24 h. In the LPS \u2192 sGP group, (A) IFN\u03b3 (20 ng/mL) or (B) IL-4 (20 ng/mL) and IL-13 (20 ng/mL) were given for 24 h. Then the cells were washed and LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) was given for 24 h. The cells were washed again and sGP (4 \u03bcg/mL) was added for 24 h. (C-D) In the LPS + sGP group, LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) and sGP (4 \u03bcg/mL) were given simultaneously for 24 h after the polarization steps. Supernatants from the cultures were harvested and the production of TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10 was measured via ELISA. (n = 3, P < .05, ns indicates not significant). monocytes have been shown to emigrate from the bone marrow and into the bloodstream during the first 72 h of microbial infection [27] . However, systemic spread of the virus and high mortality suggests that despite the rapid mobilization of the innate response, EBOV is able to overwhelm the early host response in order to infect \"carrier\" cells (i.e. macrophages and DCs) for the purpose of disseminating the virus from the site of initial infection. The hypothesis put forward in this work was that EBOV sGP operates to inhibit effector activities of these immune cells prior to their infection. Efforts to assess the modulation of DCs by sGP are underway (unpublished data). Here, the focus was on monocytes and macrophages (resting and activated). Monocytes have little impact upon viral replication given their limited phagocytic ability and cytokine production and likely are not a target of EBOV sGP. This notion was supported by the inability of sGP to alter IL-6 production by THP-1 monocytes (Fig. 1A) . By contrast, upon differentiation of monocytes into macrophages using PMA, and activation by LPS, THP-1 macrophages produced significantly less IL-6 ( Fig. 1B) . Therefore, sGP impacts macrophages only after differentiation from monocytes. This could suggest that the receptor on which sGP is binding is only expressed on differentiated macrophages and not monocytes. Work is proceeding to identify the sGP receptor as well as the signaling that may be initiated in macrophages upon incubation with sGP.",

Thus, it was thought that EBOV may similarly promote M2 polarization through the secretion of a viral protein to modulate this process. Using the in vitro THP-1 model, EBOV sGP did not demonstrate the ability to affect the polarization of macrophages into M1 or M2 phenotypes (Fig. 2) . This would seem to suggest that the spread of EBOV can benefit from correctly polarized macrophages. Again, because the macrophages were cultured with sGP prior to activation with LPS, it strongly suggests that the receptor for the viral protein is expressed or upregulated after the cells are stimulated.",

The production is also not affected if sGP is given during the polarization of M2 macrophages as noted above. However, if sGP is given during the polarization of M1 macrophages then the production of IL-10 is significantly decreased. This could possibly be due to the activity of some sGP-mediated activation of a regulatory adaptor protein such as interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4), which has a profound inhibitory effect on proinflammatory cytokine production [29] , but a milder inhibitory effect on IL-10 production [30, 31] . The fact that sGP only interferes with the IL-10 production if given during the polarization step could be due to a role of a regulatory protein such as IRF-4 in the differentiation process of hematopoietic stem cells [31] . IRF-4 has been previously shown to be a target of viral processes to suppress the immune response and promote viral pathogenesis [32, 33] . Therefore, it is possible that the presence of sGP promotes IRF-4 activity and suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines, and only impacts the IL-10 production of M1 macrophages. This is a possibility that will be pursued in future work.",

Other studies also show that soluble EBOV glycoprotein (shed, secreted, and spike) has no effect on macrophages [34] . Both of these studies were asking whether non-activated macrophages are stimulated to produce cytokines when treated with EBOV secreted glycoprotein; essentially asking whether sGP stimulates macrophage cytokine production. Thus, the finding that sGP can inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by previously activated macrophages is novel (Fig. 3) . The inhibitory effect of sGP upon IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 production may occur at either the genetic or protein secretion level. When administered to mice, the half-life of LPS is 12 h and is likely much shorter in vitro [35] . Given that the macrophages are activated with LPS for 24 h and then washed to remove excess LPS before sGP is added, this suggests that sGP does not compete with LPS for TLR4 binding as is thought for shed GP [7] . So, EBOV sGP must affect LPS-induced signaling downstream, perhaps intervening to inhibit the activation of NF-\u03baB by reinstating the action of I\u03baB kinase (IKK) [36] . Another LPS-induced pathway that may be influenced by sGP are the mitogen-activated protein kinases, MAPK. LPS binding to Toll-like receptor 4 induces MyD88 signaling through recruitment and phosphorylation of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK-4); which, in turn, activates IRAK-1. MAPK (and NF-\u03baB) are subsequently activated leading to cytokine production [37] . Two proteins that block IRAK-4 may be triggered by sGP, Tollip and IRAK-M. Another protein, suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1), could also be induced by sGP to interfere with cytokine production. Additionally, since IL-10 production by M2 macrophages was unchanged in the presence of sGP, it is highly unlikely that sGP impedes pro-inflammatory cytokine production by blocking protein secretory pathways. An understanding of how sGP affects NF-\u03baB as well as the MAPK signaling pathways leading to cytokine production are underway.",

            "text": "While sGP appeared to have the capacity to interfere with LPSmediated signals following activation, sGP was incapable of altering LPS signals when given at the same time as the stimulant ( Fig. 3C and D) . Possibly, sGP has a much shorter half-life than LPS; and thus, cytokines could be reduced for a short term and then restored by the time cytokine concentrations are determined at the 24-h endpoint of the experiment. An examination of the cytokine production at 12, 16, 20 and 24 h will address this issue. This rapid turnover may account for the projected high levels of sGP in the tissues and blood of infected animals [7] . EBOV GP and LPS have also been suggested to compete for the same receptor, TLR4; a possible attachment factor for the virus [7, 13, 38] , which is expressed on macrophages. Whether the secreted, truncated version of GP may also bind to TLR4 is unknown. From these studies, sGP appeared not to have an impact upon cellular functions until the cells were activated suggesting that the receptor may not be constitutively expressed. Interestingly, related studies with natural killer (NK) cells lacking TLR4 and treatment with sGP have shown inhibition of NK effector functions indicating that sGP may at least have an alternate receptor which exists both on activated macrophages and NK cells (unpublished data).",

Phagocytic action is increased when the macrophages assume the M1 phenotype, and is relatively lower for the M2 phenotype. The soluble antigen, ovalbumin, has been shown to be phagocytosed by DCs via the C-type lectin, mannose receptor [39] . C-type lectins have also been implicated as the possible attachment factor for EBOV entry into the host cells [11, 40] . Interestingly, phagocytosis of ovalbumin by activated THP-1 M1 macrophages was not affected by treatment of sGP (Fig. 4) . If the proposed hypothesis were correct, sGP would not interfere with the ability of the macrophages to uptake the virus through C-type lectins. Thus, C-type lectins may be important EBOV ligands for cell entry [16] .",

Indeed, EBOV sGP inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine production and chemotaxis while preserving the cellular ability to take up antigens. Therefore, sGP may play a major role in EBOV pathogenesis in two ways. First, by impairing activated macrophages, the virus can rapidly produce progeny virion and spread to other parts of the body. Second, the paralyzed macrophages serve as a pool of susceptible host cells for infection. This information may be an important consideration when devising therapies given the unusually high replication rate of the virus and copious production of soluble viral proteins such as sGP, which may diminish efficacy of host immunity.",
