            "text": "Aims: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused a large outbreak of atypical pneumonia in Beijing, China from early March 2003. We report the pathological features from three patients who died of SARS. Methods: Autopsies were performed on three patients who died 9-15 days after the onset of the illness, and the clinical and laboratory features reviewed. Tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and in situ reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on lung sections was performed using SARS coronavirusspecific primers. Results: The typical gross pathological change in the lungs was diffuse haemorrhage on the lung surface. Histopathological examination revealed serous, fibrinous and haemorrhagic inflammation in most pulmonary alveoli, with capillary engorgement and some capillary microthrombosis. The pulmonary alveoli were thickened with interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, diffuse alveolar damage, desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline-membrane formation; fibrinoid material and erythrocytes were present in alveolar spaces. There were thromboemboli in some bronchial arterioles. Haemorrhagic necrosis and reduced numbers of lymphocytes were observed in lymph nodes and spleen. In situ RT-PCR detected SARS coronavirus RNA in type II alveolar cells, interstitial cells and bronchiolar epithelial cells from all three patients. Conclusions: Severe immunological damage in lung tissue is responsible for the clinical features of SARS.",

The causative agent is a novel coronavirus, which has not been detected previously in human populations. It has been isolated in culture and detected by electron microscopy and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from a range of clinical specimens. In addition, serological evidence of infection has been found in most patients fitting the clinical definition of SARS, although antibody responses may be slow to develop. [2] [3] [4] [5] The genome of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been sequenced from multiple clinical isolates. 6 SARS is fatal in at least 10% of cases, with a higher mortality in the elderly or where the person has underlying diabetes, heart or lung disease, or impaired immunity. 5, 7, 8 An understanding of the pathogenesis and histopathological features of SARS-CoV infection is essential to the management of the disease.",

As expected, the predominant damage was evident in the lungs and was characterised by acute exudative and haemorrhagic inflammation. Capillary permeability increased markedly as part of the SARS-CoV infection (possibly exacerbated by toxins or coinfection with other pathogens), leading to a leakage of proteins and RBC into the alveolar walls and spaces. There was diffuse alveolar damage, with accumulation of exudate and oedema in alveolar spaces and evidence of hyaline-membrane formation in some alveolar spaces. 2, [7] [8] [9] These features were present in all three patients, whose length of disease ranged from nine to 15 days, a period of time shorter than in most SARS cases where lung pathology has been reported. 2, 5, 8, 9 Other patients who had lung tissue examined early after disease onset showed similar findings. 9 Giant multinucleated syncytial cells were not seen in this study. These cells were evident in less than half of the patients where lung tissue was collected in the first two weeks of disease. 4, 7, 9 Cynomologus macaques experimentally infected with SARS-CoV and sacrificed six days post inoculation showed a similar interstitial pneumonia of differing severity. 10 Haemophagocytosis has been reported only occasionally. 9 A three-stage process has been described with acute respiratory lung disease, including an inflammatory or exudative phase, a proliferative phase, and a final fibrotic phase when the illness is of longer duration. 9, 11 The variable degree of exudative inflammation present in different lobes or parts of lobes of the lungs probably represents evolution in the progression of SARS. Other abnormal changes were noted, including hydropic degeneration, fatty degeneration and interstitial cell proliferation that might be caused by the pathogen, or pathogeninduced damage such as hyperpyrexia or hypoxia. The thickened capillary basement membranes, alveolar wall oedema, interstitial cell proliferation, apoptosis and loss of alveolar epithelial cells, exudation, accumulation of proteins and RBC would result in reduced air exchange and oxygenation. Impaired ventilation would result from the bronchiolar hyperaemia and oedema, and the lymphocyte and monocyte infiltration, leading to anoxia, dyspnoea and eventual respiratory failure.",

These are likely to represent SARS-CoV located in type I and II pulmonary epithelial cells, a feature noted by others. 9 We detected SARS-CoV RNA using in situ RT-PCR, with positive cells distributed in alveolar epithelial cells, pulmonary interstitial cells and bronchiolar epithelial cells. These are consistent with electron microscopy findings of virus-like particles in lung tissue from patients with SARS. 4, 9, 12 Others have noted that detection of viral particles is not a constant feature, although this probably reflects the timing of lung tissue sampling. 2, 5, [7] [8] [9] A novel observation was the damage to pulmonary hilar lymph nodes including loss of lymphocytes in the cortical regions, loss of the germinal centre, and macrophage proliferation in subcapsular sinuses. Splenic changes were similar to the one other report of splenic histopathology, 9 although others have reported only lung involvement. 8 The SARS-CoV is readily detected by RT-PCR, often for some weeks, in faeces from patients with SARS, although we did not find obvious pathological changes in the gastrointestinal tract. It is possible that different modes of transmission (respiratory, fomites or faecal-oral) may influence the pathological findings in different tissues.",

Our data showed that the patients who died relatively early in the illness have acute pulmonary damage, associated with peripheral neutropenia and lymphopenia, and it is likely that these effects are involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection. Immunological injury is likely to be of pathologic importance in this disease, as it is in animal coronavirus infections such as feline infectious peritonitis. 14 ",
