            "text": "The translation of eukaryotic mRNAs is generally dependent upon 5'-cap-mediated ribosome binding. Ribosomes associate with the 5' cap structure before scanning along the mRNA molecule to the site of translational initiation, in most instances the first AUG codon. While the 'scanning model' of translation initiation 1 suitably accommodates most eukaryotic mRNAs, notable exceptions are provided by the picornavirus family. These viruses produce non-capped transcripts with long (600-1200 nucleotides) 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) containing multiple non-initiating AUG codons. The translational efficacy of these RNAs is dependent on the presence of specific sequences within the UTR called internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) 2,3.",

            "text": "The function of an IRES element was first shown by Pelletier and Sonenberg 2 who constructed artificial dicistronic mRNAs to determine whether internal entry of ribosomes could constitute an alternative pathway to cap-mediated ribosome binding in initiating translation ( Fig. 1) . Their investigations established that the intercistronic insertion of a defined poliovirus sequence of 490 nucleotides enabled efficient translation of a downstream cistron. Furthermore, cap-mediated translation of the upstream cistron could be blocked without affecting translation of the downstream cistron (Fig. lc) . Thus, the translation of the downstream cistron is not attributable to leaky scanning or reinitiation by ribosomes binding via the cap complex, but is governed independently by direct association of ribosomes with the IRES. In other words, the IRES acts as a ribosome landing pad 2. It is of interest to note that these elegant experiments used poliovirus infection to block capdependent translation. Poliovirus, a member of the picornavirus family, is itself reliant upon IRES-mediated translation for protein synthesis. The normal infective strategy of the virus involves inactivation of the essential cap-binding complex eIF-4F and hence capture of the cellular translational apparatus for its own use. Importantly, however, the function of the IRES is not dependent on viral gene products but relies on interaction with normal cellular proteins 4. Moreover, members of the cardiovirus subfamily such as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) do not inhibit cellular translation and their IRES sequences function efficiently in competition with cap-mediated initiation (see below).",

Resistance of specific mRNAs to inhibition of cap-mediated translation may be an important antiviral adaptation. It has also been suggested that cellular IRES elements could facilitate selective protein synthesis during mitosis when the activity of elF-4F is greatly reduced 6. The discovery of IRES elements in transcripts of the Antennapedia gene in Drosophila 6 and the mouse Fgf2 gene 7 has prompted further speculation of a role for cap-independent translation in the developmental regulation of gene expression. It is worth noting that eukaryotic IRES sequences could be more widespread than has hitherto been realized because they cannot be identified by sequence homology; known IRES have been functionally defined and, so far, no conserved features have been found.",

            "text": "Many in vitro applications for mammalian transgenesis demand the coexpression of heterologous gene products. For example, in order to establish stable cell lines producing a recombinant protein it is generally necessary to introduce vectors for expression both of the protein of interest and of a selectable marker. This is usually achieved either by co-transfecting cells with two independent constructs or by introducing a single vector harbouring two discrete expression cassettes. The first approach is often limited by the inefficiency of co-transfection. The second requires the construction of relatively complex and cumbersome vectors and generally suffers from unreliable and/or low expression of the non-selectable cDNA. The use of an IRES in dicistronic expression vectors can circumvent these problems by enabling a single transcription unit to provide efficient production of both the protein of interest and a selectable markee s (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, the direct coupling of the selectable marker to the desired cDNA enables effective selective pressure to be mainrained for expression of the desired cDNA. with IRES dicistronic constructs expressed both the selectable marker and the linked reporter 9. By contrast, expression of the non-selectable gene product was rarely observed using viral vectors that rely on twin promoters or alternative splicing. Most requirements for coexpression can be satisfied by vectors that provide comparable translational efficiencies for both cistrons of a dicistronic mRNA in a given cell type. However, the finding that translational efficiency of the poliovirus IRES varies according to the position of the initiating AUG codon 1\u00b0 suggests that it may be possible to modulate the expression of the second cistron if desired. This could facilitate accurate correlations between biological response and amount of transgene product.",

At its simplest, this approach is In previous genomic fusion constructs, cDNA insertion has been restricted to sites upstream of the genomic translation initiation codon. Results have been disappointing due to alterations in RNA splicing and processing and the deletion of internal regulatory sequences 22. However, the use of IRES elements would bypass the constraints of cap-mediated translation initiation and allow a cDNA sequence to be positioned internally or preferably in the 3' UTR of an intact gene. Insertion of a heterologous reading frame in the last exon of a gene might be particularly effective because this would be compatible with the larger size of final exons in vertebrates 23 and is anticipated to have minimal consequences for RNA processing.

IRES sequences are also effective in expression strategies in cell culture based on bacteriophage RNA polymerases that produce non-capped transcripts 24. Most compellingly, data generated following the introduction of the IRES-13geo cassette into a variety of chromosomal loci by either gene trapping or gene targeting (see below) have established that the IRES sequence from EMCV is functional in vivo in a wide range of both fetal and adult mouse tissues.

SMITHModification of the genetic content of cultured cells or of whole animals is now a key strategy in both basic biological research and applied biotechnology. Yet obtaining the desired level and specificity of expression of an introduced gene remains highly problematic. One solution could be to couple expression of a transgene to that of an appropriate intact genomic locus. The identification and functional characterization of RNA sequences known as internal ribosome entry sites nowoffer the possibility of achieving precise control of transgene expression through the generation of dicistronic fusion mRNAs.",
