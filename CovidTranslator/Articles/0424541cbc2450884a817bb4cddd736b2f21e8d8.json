We identified for the first time, a stability control region between residues 97 and 118. Fragments of tropomyosin lacking this region (1-81, 1-92, and 1-99) still fold into two-stranded \u03b1-helical coiledcoils but are significantly less stable (T m between 26-28.5\u00b0C) than longer fragments containing this region (1-119, 1-131, 1-260 and 1-284) which show a large increase in their thermal midpoints (T m between 40-43\u00b0C) for a \u0394T m of 16\u00b0C between 1-99 and 1-119. We further investigated two additional fragments which ended between residues 99 and 119, that is fragments 1-105 and 1-110. These fragments were more stable than 1-99 and less stable than 1-119 and showed that there were three separate sites that synergistically contribute to the large jump in protein stability (two electrostatic clusters, 97-104 and 112-118 and one hydrophobic interaction from Leu 110. All the residues involved in these stabilizing interactions are located outside the hydrophobic core a and d positions which have been shown to be the major contributor to coiled-coil stability. Our results clearly show that protein stability is more complex than previously thought and unique sites can synergistically control protein stability over long distances.",

To reduce complexity we chose to study one of nature's most simplistic protein motifs, the two-stranded \u03b1-helical coiled-coil for the following reasons: first, it contains only one type of secondary structure, the \u03b1-helix, that is, there is no other elements of structure (\u03b2sheet, \u03b2-turns or undefined structure) to complicate interpretation of results; second, only two \u03b1-helices are required to introduce tertiary and quaternary structure; third, the rod-like nature of the two-stranded \u03b1-helical coiled-coil simplifies the understanding of protein folding and stability to a one-dimensional problem rather than a three-dimensional problem observed in globular proteins; fourth, all of the non-covalent interactions that stabilize the threedimensional structure of globular proteins are found in coiled-coils; fifth, it is an abundant protein motif with diverse functional roles 1 ; sixth, its diversity in polypeptide chain length, from the short, less than 35 residues in DNA binding domains, 2 to intermediate lengths, e.g. 284 residues in tropomyosin to even longer than 1,000 residues in myosin coiled-coils makes it an ideal system to test predictions of factors responsible for protein stability; and seventh, it is easy to experimentally monitor folding and stability of coiled-coils using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Thus, for the research described in this manuscript, we chose to study tropomyosin since it is the most extensively studied parallel two-stranded \u03b1-helical coiled-coil known and of sufficient length to be representative of all long coiled-coils exceeding 100residues.",

There are variances in helix orientation (parallel or antiparallel), oligomerization state (two to five \u03b1-helices) and oligomerization specificity (homo-or hetero-oligomerization). This diversity in structure allows for the multiplicity in functions of native coiled-coils.",

This simple protein folding motif consists of two amphipathic, right-handed \u03b1-helices that adopt a left-handed super coil, analogous to a two-stranded rope where the non-polar face of each \u03b1-helix is continually adjacent to that of the other helix. Tropomyosin (TM) was the first \u03b1-helical coiled-coil protein to have its amino acid sequence determined 4, 5 . From this sequence we identified a hydrophobic repeat responsible for the formation and stabilization of the coiled-coil structure (N X X N X X X N X X N X X X N\u2026 where N is a non-polar residue). This repeating sequence of seven amino acid residues is denoted (a b c d e f g) n where positions a and d are occupied predominantly by hydrophobic/non-polar residues. This hydrophobic repeat was continuous and uninterrupted throughout the entire 284-residue polypeptide chain of tropomyosin. We then verified the importance of hydrophobic residues at positions a and d in the formation and stability of coiled-coils by designing and synthesizing by solid-phase peptide chemistry the first model coiled-coil protein 6 . Furthermore, we have demonstrated the effect of chain length on the stabilization and formation of two-stranded \u03b1-helical coiled-coils [7] [8] [9] . These studies clearly demonstrated the utility of small model coiled-coil proteins for studying protein folding and stability of \u03b1-helical proteins in general.",

            "text": "The first high resolution X-ray structure of a parallel two-stranded \u03b1-helical coiled-coil, GCN4, a 33-residue DNA-binding protein was determined in 1991 10 . This structure as predicted by Crick (1953) 3 showed the individual \u03b1-helices wrapping around each other to form a quarter turn of the left-handed super coil. The individual \u03b1-helices with a crossing angle of 18\u00b0 were smoothly bent because the main chain hydrogen bonds at the interface were shorter than those on the outside of the helices. This difference in hydrogen bond length creating a natural curvature is a property of amphipathic \u03b1-helices 11 . Recent inspection of the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB) has revealed 552 high resolution protein structures containing the coiled-coil motif, out of 29,509 protein entries that have been solved by X-ray crystallography and NMR. The structures clearly show that the a and d positions are almost totally buried in the coiled-coil and are structurally distinct, that is, the side-chains at these positions pack differently and have different orientations relative to the coiled-coil axis 10 . Analysis of coiledcoils has revealed that though hydrophobic amino acids predominate at positions a and d in the hydrophobic core of coiled-coils, all other amino acids with the exception of Pro are tolerated in these positions 12 . This led Hodges and coworkers to design a model coiled-coil protein and determine the effect of substituting 20 different amino acid residues at position a and d in the center of the coiled-coil. These authors showed that single amino acid substitutions in these positions can make a wide range of contributions to stability depending on the residue (a range of stability of ~ 7 kcal/mole at each a and d position) [13] [14] [15] . Based on this experimentally derived stability data an algorithm, STABLECOIL, was developed to predict the location of coiled-coils in protein sequences (http://biomol.uchsc.edu/researchFacilities/ComputationalCore/stablecoil/index.html).",

            "text": "To predict the overall stability of a protein one must not only identify all of the different types of non-covalent interactions contributing to protein stability but must also have a quantitative value for each interaction. In the case of the two-stranded coiled-coil, due to the rod-like nature of the coiled-coil it is reasonable to assume that the contributions to overall protein stability are additive. Numerous studies of \u03b1-helices, coiled-coils, and globular proteins have identified interactions affecting coiled-coil and protein stability in general, including polypeptide chain length 7-9,16-18 , stability contributions from residues in the hydrophobic core (a and d) positions [13] [14] [15] and references therein, side-chain van der Waals packing effects 19-21 , translational and rotational entropy 22 , interchain and intrachain electrostatic interactions [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] and references therein, side-chain helical propensities [36] [37] [38] [39] , helix-dipole effects 40 and references therein, N and C-terminal helix capping effects [41] [42] [43] and references therein, control of oligomerization state 10, 15, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] , controlling parallel and antiparallel orientation of \u03b1helices in coiled-coils [50] [51] [52] [53] and references therein, controlling homo-versus heterodimerization in coiled-coils 24, 54-61 and several different types of intra-helical sidechain: side-chain interactions [62] [63] [64] . De novo designed coiled-coils have been used for example, for a wide-range of applications 54, 57, 65, 66 .",

            "text": "Though there has been a massive accumulation of knowledge about the interactions that stabilize \u03b1-helices and coiled-coils, recent results suggest that there may be many more unique interactions that need to be discovered in coiled-coils before we will be able to predict protein stability from amino acid sequence, in general. First, we recently determined a 1.17A\u00b0r esolution X-ray crystal structure of a coiled-coil and identified three new stabilizing interactions: a unique hydrogen bonding-electrostatic network not previously observed in coiled-coils and two other hydrophobic interactions involving Leu residues at positions e and g from both g-a\u2032 and d-e\u2032 interchain interactions with the hydrophobic core 67 . Second, an intriguing study by Kammerer et al, 1998 68 demonstrated that the stability of the hydrophobic core alone is not always a reliable determinant of protein folding. They proposed the idea that a \"trigger sequence\" may exist within coiled-coil domains since deletion constructs of cortexillin I and myosin II lacking a 14-residue sequence failed to fold 69, 70 . Analysis of the trigger site revealed a distinct network of interhelical and intrahelical salt bridges 71 . A sevenresidue trigger site in the three-stranded human macrophage scavenger receptor coiled-coil domain was identified further supporting the idea of a trigger site stabilizing the coiled-coil in order to allow the folding process to take place 72 . Our laboratory had previously addressed the question, are trigger sequences essential in the folding of two-stranded \u03b1-helical coiled-coils? We showed that a specific consensus trigger sequence is not essential for coiled-coil formation and concluded that any sequence that increases overall coiled-coil stability beyond a threshold level under given conditions allows folding to occur 73 . Nevertheless, the ability to identify trigger sites in coiled-coils, when they exist, and quantitate their contribution to the overall stability of the folded protein is essential. Third, amino acid sequence analyses of long-coiledcoil proteins (>100 residues) that differ in composition, function and length have revealed remarkable similarity in their amino acid arrangement in the hydrophobic core. For example, the core a and d residues of tropomyosin (284 residues per polypeptide chain) and myosin heavy chain (1,086 residues) are organized into clusters (consecutive core positions) with similar hydrophobic nature, rather than having hydrophobicity randomly distributed along the entire length of the coiled-coil. We termed these, stabilizing and destabilizing clusters and defined a cluster as three or more consecutive core residues of non-polar stabilizing residues (consisting of one of six hydrophobes, Leu, Ile, Val, Met, Phe and Tyr) or three or more consecutive core residues of destabilizing residues (consisting of amino acid residues Gly, Ala, Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln, Asp, Glu, Arg, His and Lys) which are small non-polar, polar or charged side-chains. In addition, these two coiled-coils have similar numbers of stabilizing and destabilizing residues in core a and d positions, 58% and 42%, respectively 74 . We have also showed that the organization of clusters in the hydrophobic core of coiled-coils creates regions of varying stabilities, thus allowing a dynamic protein molecule consisting of subdomains of high and low stability. Alternating these regions could be important in controlling the overall stability of the protein where regions of higher stability could be important in maintaining structure and regions of less stability could be important for interactions with other biomolecules or modulating overall stability/flexibility. We also demonstrated that a minimum of 3 consecutive stabilizing residues is required to form a cluster and concluded that the role of hydrophobicity in the hydrophobic core of coiled-coils is extremely context dependent and clustering is an important aspect of protein folding and stability 75, 76 . Interestingly, in general the stabilizing clusters in tropomyosin and myosin ranged in size from 3 to 6 consecutive stabilizing residues in the hydrophobic core a and d positions and destabilizing clusters from 3 to 5 consecutive destabilizing residues 74 . Both calorimetric and pressure denaturation experiments have shown independent domains with different stabilities persist along the entire length of the tropomyosin coiled-coil [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] . Crystallographic evidence and mutational studies have suggested that regions of instability in tropomyosin are important to provide the necessary flexibility 82-85 required for actin binding and that increasing the stability of the coiled-coil in the actin binding region increased overall protein stability but had an adverse effect on binding/ function 86, 87 .",

The stabilizing clusters, destabilizing clusters and intervening regions were well distributed throughout the sequences of myosin and tropomyosin 74 . An example of an intervening region in tropomyosin is shown in Figure 1 where the residues in the hydrophobic core are Met127a, Ile130d, Ala134a, Asp137d, Met141a, Gln144d and Leu148a. One might postulate that intervening regions provide intermediate stability in the hydrophobic core between high stability of stabilizing clusters and low stability of destabilizing clusters. It is interesting that a trigger site first identified in cortexillin I which was essential for coiled-coil folding 68,69 does not involve a stabilizing cluster in the hydrophobic core (the 14-residue trigger site contains Ra, Ld, La and Td in the hydrophobic core). These results further emphasizes that the hydrophobic core alone does not control the stability of coiled-coils and that other interactions outside of the hydrophobic core can dramatically enhance stability.",

We will refer to the latter region as a \"stability control region\" to distinguish it from a \"trigger site\" which is essential to trigger folding. That is, C-terminal truncation sequences that contain this \"stability control region\" will confer the overall stability of tropomyosin and sequences that do not contain this region will fold but will have stabilities dramatically lower than that of the native protein.",

Clusters of 3 or more consecutive stabilizing hydrophobic residues in positions a and d (Leu, Ile, Val, Met, Phe and Tyr) contribute more to coiled-coil stability than when these same hydrophobic residues are separated by destabilizing residues. From the sequence of tropomyosin (Figure 1 ), the majority of stabilizing clusters are located near either termini, with 4 stabilizing clusters in the N-terminal region 1-99 and 5 stabilizing clusters in the C-terminal region 169-284. Therefore, we prepared fragment 1-81 which contains three stabilizing clusters and ends in a destabilizing cluster consisting of Ala74, Ala78 and Ala 81. This destabilizing cluster at the C-terminal end of the fragment is expected to be destabilizing to the overall stability of the fragment. In comparison, fragment 1-92 ends with an additional 3residue stabilizing cluster (Val85, Leu88 and Ile92) and one might expect this fragment to be considerably more stable than fragment 1-81. Similarly, 1-99 further extends the stabilizing cluster to involve 5 consecutive stabilizing residues (Val85, Leu88, Ile92, Val95 and Leu99) in the hydrophobic core at the C-terminal of this fragment. Fragment 1-99 would be expected to be even more stable than 1-92. Fragments 1-119 and 1-131 further extend the coiled-coil sequence with an intervening region and destabilizing cluster ( Figure 1 ). Based on the stability coefficients for the a and d positions 14, 15 and chain length effects 9 one would expect these two fragments to be less stable than 1-99. Thus, the predicted order of stability of these five fragments based solely on stabilizing clusters, their location and chain length effects would be 1-81 < 1-92 < 1-99 > 1-119 and 1-131. The last fragment prepared was 1-260 which deleted the region 261-284 which was suggested by Paulucci et al, 2002 89 to contain a region critical to the overall stability of C-terminal fragments of tropomyosin.",

            "text": "Remarkably, all TM constructs, including the relatively short TM (1-81), were nearly 90% helical at 5\u00b0C in benign conditions at 3-5 \u03bcM monomer ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ). Even the shortest fragment did not exhibit significant helix induction in the helix promoting condition of 50% trifluoroethanol (TFE). Furthermore, the molar ellipticity 222/208 ratios for all analogs is greater than 1 (ranging from 1.02 to 1.12) illustrating that coiled-coils are fully formed whereas single-stranded alpha-helices in 50% TFE the 222/208 ratio is less than 1 7, 90 . Despite our original design hypothesis, the number of stabilizing clusters does not seem to have any significant effect on the overall \u03b1-helical content. We confirmed the oligomerization states of these TM fragments using sedimentation equilibrium experiments with global analyses at 3 different concentrations and 3 different speeds. In the presence of DTT and low protein concentrations (\u2264 20 \u03bcM dimer), TM fragments 1-81, 1-92 and 1-99 underwent a monomerdimer equilibrium at speeds ranging from 8000K, 12000K and 16000K with an apparent molecular mass that is less than a dimer. Larger TM fragments TM 1-119 and beyond exhibited dimeric oligomerization states under the conditions tested ( Table 1 ). The relative stabilities of these TM fragments were then measured by thermal denaturation. Despite similar high helical content at 5\u00b0C among the TM fragments, we observed a large jump in stability as we extended the TM fragment beyond 99 residues (Figure 4) . A large thermal midpoint difference (\u0394T m 16\u00b0C between 1-99 and 1-119) distinguish the instability of the shorter TM fragments (< 100 residues) compared to those of 119 residues and longer. All the short TM constructs shared a T m between 26-28.5\u00b0C whereas longer fragments have a native TM-like midpoint between 40-43\u00b0C. Again to our surprise, the stabilities of these fragments did not correlate with the distribution of stabilizing clusters, but rather, the region between 100-119 seemed to confer this increased stabilization. We refer to this region as a \"stability control region\" for tropomyosin because the presence of this region confers native like stability. One interesting feature in region 100-119 is highlighted by the heptad sequence 112-118 which is shown in Figure 5 and denoted electrostatic cluster 2. This 7-residue region contains a multitude of i to i + 3 and i to i + 4 intrachain electrostatic attractions and interchain i to i\u2032 + 5 electrostatic attractions in each chain of the two-stranded \u03b1-helical coiled-coil. Despite having only one stabilizing Leu as a core residue, this single heptad has four electrostatic attractions or a total of 8 electrostatic attractions in the two-stranded coiled-coil. Thus, we postulate that this unique heptad sequence KLEEAEK must provide electrostatic interactions that contribute substantially more to stability than individual electrostatics previously identified in coiledcoils. The contributions of i to i\u2032 + 5 (g-e\u2032) salt bridges in coiled-coils to stability, range on average between 0.4 to 0.6 kcal/mol per salt bridge 25, 35, 91 . It has also been shown that orientation of the salt bridge favors the Kg-Ee\u2032 over the Eg-Ke\u2032 orientation 23, 35, 92 . Orientation and spacing for salt-bridges in \u03b1-helices has been studied 93 . In addition, it has been demonstrated that when there are multiple electrostatic attractions possible (interchain and intrachain) between the same charged residues or a network of interactions there is a large enhancement to stability over the sum of individual interactions 67, 71, 92, 94 . This leads us to hypothesize that this site, because of its large number of intra-and interchain electrostatic attractions, must contribute significantly more to stability relative to any other individual heptad in tropomyosin.",

Lys at position d has been shown to be considerably more destabilizing than Ala at this position in model coiled-coils 15 and i to i + 3 or i to i + 4 intrachain ionic attractions do not exist with Lys at position d in this sequence.

            "text": "Two additional chain-length fragments were prepared, 1-105 and 1-110, that ended in the stability control region between 99 and 119. Based only on the stability clusters and their location, these fragments would not be expected to increase stability compared to fragment 1-99. As shown in Fig. 5 , extension of the sequence from 1-99 to 1-105 adds an Ala in the hydrophobic core at position 102d which contributes very little to stability based on the stability coefficients of residues in the hydrophobic core of coiled-coils. 15 On the other hand, this extension adds R101 which adds a potential of three intra-chain electrostatic interactions in the eight residue sequence, EELDRAQE, in each chain of the two-stranded coiled-coil (Fig.  5) . We refer to this 8-residue region as electrostatic cluster I (97-104). For monomer concentrations of 35-52 \u03bcM, the T m of fragment 1-105 was 33\u00b0C, compared to fragment 1-99 with a T m of 29\u00b0C. This increase in stability (\u0394T m of 4\u00b0C) can only be explained by the contribution of electrostatic cluster I to the stability of the coiled-coil (Fig. 5 and Fig. 7A ). Fragment 1-110 contains electrostatic cluster I (97-104) discussed above and extends the polypeptide chain to residue 110. This sequence was chosen to exclude electrostatic cluster II, 112-118 (KLEEAEK). Thus, we could compare the stability of fragment 1-110 with fragment 1-105 which contains electrostatic cluster I and fragment 1-119 which contains both electrostatic clusters I and II (Fig. 5 and Fig. 7A ). Our expectation was that fragment 1-110 would show no increased stability since the extension contains an Ala residue at position 109 which is known to be very destabilizing relative to Leu in the hydrophobic core 15 and no additional electrostatics were added compared to 1-105. To our surprise, the T m of fragment 1-110 was 37\u00b0C. This increase (\u0394T m of 4\u00b0C) can only be explained by a significant contribution of Leu at position 110e to stability. It has been previously shown by our laboratory that large hydrophobes like Leu at positions e and g can contribute to stability even though they are not in the hydrophobic core. 67 However, this increase in stability was not anticipated because of the Ala residue at position 109d (Fig. 5) in the hydrophobic core. The stability of the fragments 1-99 (T m 29\u00b0C, 1-105 (T m 33\u00b0C), 1-110 (T m 37\u00b0C) and the 1-119 (T m 47\u00b0C) shows that electrostatic cluster II (112-118) contributes a \u0394T m of 10\u00b0C to stability (Fig. 7) . Thus, the dramatic jump in stability observed between 1-99 and 1-119 (\u0394T m of 18\u00b0C) involves three sites: electrostatic cluster I, 97-104; electrostatic cluster II, 112-118 and the hydrophobic contribution of Leu 110. Together these three sites account for a \u0394T m of 16-18\u00b0C between fragments 1-99 and 1-119 over a monomeric concentration range of 3-52 \u03bcM (Table 1 and Fig. 7A ).",

It has been shown that Leu at position d not only provides the highest stability to model coiled-coils, it has the highest occurrence at this position in native coiled-coils. This result suggests that the smaller Ala residue in the hydrophobic core may be a requirement to allow more favorable electrostatic attractions in this region and a more favorable hydrophobic packing from Leu 110. These interactions not only have to overcome the loss of stability by the presence of the three Ala residues instead of Leu residues in the hydrophobic core but substantially enhance stability. To add support for this observation we searched our heptad coiled-coil data base for the sequence KLEELEK with the Ala at position d replaced by Leu. As expected, this sequence was only observed twice in tropomyosins (0.7%). We also searched the data base for the sequence KXEEAEK to see if any other large hydrophobe (Ile, Val, Met, Phe, Tyr) other than Leu was acceptable in position a of this \"stability control site\". As expected, only one such sequence was found in the heptad coiled-coil data base (Table 3 ) again suggesting the uniqueness of this site. Taken together these computational results suggest that nature has chosen a unique combination of special sites to create a region that can dramatically enhance stability.",

This construct deletes our \"stability control region\" identified in this study. The deletion mutant had a stability decrease of ~10\u00b0C compared to wild-type tropomyosin 95 . The conditions for determining T m values was different (10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 containing 500 mM NaCl). High salt (500 mM) is known to significantly stabilize tropomyosin by 10\u00b0C in T m compared to its absence 96 . Nevertheless, their study does support the need for the \"stability control region\" to achieve native protein stability. Paulucci et al (2002) 89 68 proposed a trigger consensus sequence that is responsible for the initiation of folding in coiled-coils including a site in tropomyosin residues 226-238. The thirteen residue consensus sequence proposed by Kammerer et al (1998) 68 was xxLExchxcxccx where c is a charged residue, h is a hydrophobe and x is any residue. In chicken skeletal \u03b1-tropomyosin this consensus sequence clearly does not exist where the defined E of the consensus sequence has been replaced by T229 and the charged residue by T237 (226-238, KVLTDKLKEAETR). In addition, our data clearly show that this region has no affect on folding or stability of chicken skeletal \u03b1-tropomyosin since fragments 1-119 and 1-131 which do not have this region (226-238) are folded and have native TM stability (T m 42.0 and 43.0\u00b0C",

The flow rate was 300 \u03bcl/min. and the detection wavelengths used were 210 nm and 280 nm. Briefly, the purification protocol involved three steps: first, a rapidly-rising linear AB gradient (increasing 2.0% B per min), (where eluent A was 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and eluent B was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) reached a concentration of acetonitrile at 15% below that of the elution concentration for the protein of interest in the crude sample (first observed on a smaller-scale analytical RP-HPLC run); second, a slower linear AB gradient (0.1-0.2% B per min, depending on lysate complexity) with the above eluents was used to separate the protein of interest; and third, an isocratic run at a high acetonitrile concentration to wash off any remaining hydrophobic impurities (e.g., 70% acetonitrile). The fractions containing the protein product were pooled, lypholized and verified by quantitative amino acid analysis (Beckman model 6300 amino acid analyzer, Bechman-Coulter, Palo Alto, CA) and by electrospray mass spectrometry on a Mariner Biospectrometry work station (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).",

A primary search for tropomyosins was conducted using the NCBI BLAST WEB interface (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) with the nr (non-redundant) database and all other parameters defaulted 99, 100 . The search sequence was human alpha tropomyosin 1 (gi|13938565|gbAAH07433.1). 5000 sequences were retained from this search. From this list, all sequences whose tag contained the word tropomyosin (and its mis-spellings) or the word tpm were extracted (using a case-insensitive search). This first list was manually curated to determine the start residue of the heptad repeats. At the same time, sequences which did not fit the heptad repeat pattern or had a high content of proline residues were removed from the list. This created an initial database of 422 tropomyosin proteins. This database was analysed using the heptad start residue and assuming heptad repeats with no insertions/deletions to find all unique heptad sequences. The heptad analysis for a sequence was terminated if a heptad with 2 prolines was seen or two prolines had been seen in the sequence. The number of occurrences of each unique sequence heptad were counted. From this list and sorting by number of occurrences it was seen that the 5 most occurring unique sequence heptads actually formed a contiguous sequence of 35 residues, RIQLVEEELDRAQERLATALQKLEEAEKAADESER. This sequence was used in an ungapped BLAST search of the current tropomyosin database for specific sequences (word count 2, PAM30 matrix and gap parameters 32767 and 32767) and only sequences which had a primary ungapped match of 25 or more residues were retained to form the final tropomyosin database.
