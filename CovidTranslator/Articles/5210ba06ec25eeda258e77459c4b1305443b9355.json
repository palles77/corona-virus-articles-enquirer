The LC3-II turnover rate was estimated by western blot, autophagosomes were visualized by confocal microscopy, and ultrastructural analysis was performed using electron microscopy. Autophagy flux was observed using chloroquine as an inhibitor of the autophagic process. The influence of autophagy on BVDV replication and release was investigated using virus titration, and its effect on cell viability was also studied. The effect of BVDVinduced autophagy on the survival of BVDV-infected host cell, cell apoptosis, and interferon (IFN) signalling was studied by flow cytometric analysis and quantitative RT-(q)PCR using shBCN1-MDBK cells. we found that infection with either CP or NCP BVDV strains induced steady-state autophagy in MDBK cells, as evident by the increased number of double-or single-membrane vesicles, the accumulation of GFP-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) dots, and the conversion of LC3-I (cytosolic) to LC3-II (membrane-bound) forms. The complete autophagic process was verified by monitoring the LC3-II turnover ratio, lysosomal delivery, and proteolysis. In addition, we found that CP and NCP BVDV growth was inhibited in MDBK cells treated with high levels of an autophagy inducer or inhibitor, or in autophagy deficient-MDBK cells. Furthermore, our studies also suggested that CP and NCP BVDV infection in autophagy-knockdown MDBK cells increased apoptotic cell death and enhanced the expression of the mRNAs for IFN-\u03b1, Mx1, IFN-\u03b2, and OAS-1 as compared with control MDBK cells. Our study provides strong evidence that BVDV infection induces autophagy, which facilitates BVDV replication in MDBK cells and impairs the innate immune response. These findings might help to illustrate the pathogenesis of persistent infection caused by BVDV.",

There are two biotypes of BVDV: non-cytopathic (NCP) and cytopathic (CP). One strategy that has been used to treat or prevent virus-associated diseases is the modulation of autophagy, which is used by the innate immune system to defend against viral infection; however, at present, the interplay between autophagy and BVDV remains unclear. Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells stably expressing microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) with green fluorescent protein (GFP) (GFP-LC3-MDBK cells) and autophagy-deficient MDBKs (shBCN1-MDBK Yulong Zhou and Yachao Ren have contributed equally to this work.",

Recently, the interaction of autophagy with viruses has been widely studied, including the interplay between the immunological functions of the autophagy machinery and the molecular mechanisms of viral life cycles and pathogenesis. In particular, it has been found that the modulation of autophagy might be used to treat or prevent diseases caused by several important viral pathogens [2, 3] . Autophagy is one of the earliest cellautonomous defence mechanisms against microbial invasion, and many types of viruses can induce cell autophagy by infecting host cells [4] . However, the interplay between autophagy and viruses is extremely complex and depends on the virus and host cell type [5] . The autophagy machinery in plants to mammals plays an essential antiviral role and restrains the virulence of certain viruses in vivo. For example, autophagy is antiviral for Sindbis virus and herpes simplex virus type 1 [6] . In contrast, some viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus, and dengue virus have evolved mechanisms to enhance autophagy as a means by which to suppress innate immune responses and increase viral replication [7, 8] .",

On the basis of their effects in cell culture, BVDV is divided into two biotypes: cytopathic (CP) and noncytopathic (NCP) [9] . NCP strains are widely distributed and have been successfully isolated from persistently infected animals that are immunotolerant to these strains and shed infectious virions in their secretions. In these strains, the viral RNases E rns and autoprotease N pro effectively block interferon (IFN) synthesis in BVDV-infected cells to allow the interaction of BVDV with the innate immune system of the host [10] . In contrast, CP strains are associated predominantly with animals that develop mucosal disease [11, 12] . CP-BVDV-infected cells generally demonstrate the classical signs of apoptotic cell death. Several reports have shown that the CP strains induce apoptosis by cleaving genomic DNA to nucleosomal lengths, activating caspases, reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential with release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm of the infected cell, or triggering the dsRNA response [13, 14] .",

In mammalian systems, Beclin 1 recruits other autophagy proteins to initiate the formation of the preautophagosomal membrane. However, at present, it is unclear whether the different BVDV biotypes (NCP or CP) induce different autophagy processes that result in disparate disease. Autophagy not only has a well-established role in cell survival but has also been linked to cell death, where it plays an important role in programmed necrosis and has also been linked to apoptosis through its interactions with apoptosis-related proteins [4, 16] . However, it is also unclear whether modulation of autophagy by NCP or CP BVDV facilitates survival of the host cell or is beneficial for BVDV multiplication. Therefore, in this study, we examined whether CP BVDV (HJ-1) and NCP BVDV (NY-1) strains could induce complete autophagy in MDBK cells and whether the observed response affected BVDV replication. We also investigated whether BVDV infection enhanced the IFN signalling pathway and/or apoptosis in autophagy-knockdown cells.",

Restriction enzyme recognition sequences for XhoI and BamHI were inserted in the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The primer sequences (F and R) are listed in Table 1 . The cDNA templates for PCR amplification of LC3B were obtained from MDBK cells using an RNeasy Kit (QIAGEN) for RNA isolation and a Prime-Script RT Reagent Kit (Roche) for cDNA generation. The PCR assay was carried out as follows: 25 \u03bcL of Quick Taq  HS DyeMix (TOYOBO), 100 ng of DNA, and 1 \u03bcM primers were added together, the volume was adjusted to 50  \u03bcL with sterilised distilled water, and thermal cycling was  done at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, then followed by 30 cycles of 94  \u00b0C for 30 s, 56 for \u00b0C 45 s, 72 \u00b0C for 45 s, and then 7 min at  72 \u00b0C. The recombinant GFP-LC3B plasmid was identified by double digestion with XhoI and BamHI and sequencing of potential positive clones. To generate MDBK/GFP-LC3B stable cells, MDBK cells (70 to 80% confluent) were trypsinised, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended at 1.3 \u00d7 10 7 cells ml \u22121 in PBS. Then, 4 \u03bcg of GFP-LC3B plasmid was mixed with 0.4 ml of the cell suspension and immediately pulsed using a Bio-Rad Gene PulserX (2.5 kV; 25 mF; time constant, 5 ms; one pulse). The electroporation mixture was diluted in 2 ml of DMEM containing 10% HS. The samples were then plated at 2 ml per well in 35-mm-diameter-well tissue culture dishes. To permit recovery and attachment of the electroporated cells, the cells were incubated for 12 h at 37\u00b0C. After 12 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% HS and 500 \u03bcg of G418 per ml and incubated for 2 weeks, replacing the medium with fresh medium every 48 h. The surviving cells were pooled and maintained in medium supplemented with 250 \u03bcg of G418 ml \u22121 to obtain stable cell lines for expression of the GFP-LC3B protein.",

In RAP-treated MDBK cells, the viral titre was 10 6.67 \u00b1 0.14 and 10 6.58 \u00b1 0.14 TCID 50 /0.1 mL in NY-1-or HJ-1-infected cells, respectively (Fig. 5e) , while in mock-treated cells, the viral titre was 10 5.33 \u00b1 0.38 and 10 5.42 \u00b1 0.52 TCID 50 /0.1 mL in NY-1and HJ-1-infected cells, respectively.

Therefore, different viruses have developed diverse strategies to avoid and/or suppress canonical autophagic degradation and autophagy-mediated immune activation. Recently, evidence from various viruses has indicated that autophagy can play a vital role in almost all steps of the viral life cycle [28] . Our work indicated that NCP-and CP-BVDV-induced autophagy promotes virus replication (Fig. 5) , which suggests that the autophagy machinery is critical for effective infection by BVDV. The proviral role of autophagy might be a feature of viruses in the family Flaviviridae such as HCV, dengue virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. In experimental infections with these viruses, inhibition of autophagy reduces infectious virus production [28, 29] . Although the specific proviral mechanisms utilized are unclear, in general, proviral autophagy can be divided into two gross categories: direct and indirect. A direct proviral role for autophagy indicates that the autophagy machinery physically interacts with a viral component to benefit the virus. Alternatively, some viruses can induce an autophagy process that indirectly supports infection by modifying the cellular physiology GAPDH was used as an internal control. The fold changes in mRNA levels are presented after normalization with a mock-infected control. The data are reported as the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3). Significance was analysed using a two-tailed Student's t-test. **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001 [28, 29] . In our study, the results of the cell viability assay indicated that cell viability was obviously increased in BVDV-infected control-MDBK cells versus BVDVinfected shBCN1-MDBK cells (Fig. 6 ). This finding is in agreement with previous reports that autophagy might help to keep virus-infected cells alive [8, 28, 30] .",

Autophagy might even be involved in both type 2 cell death and in programmed necrosis and has also been connected to apoptosis via its interplay with apoptosis-related proteins [4, 16] . Cell-death-related proteins including FADD, caspases, Nix, and c-FLIP can in turn interact with the autophagy proteins Atg5, GABARAP, Beclin 1, and Atg3 [4, 31] , which might modulate autophagy. The antiapoptotic proteins BCL2 and BCL-xl also interact with Beclin 1 and inhibit autophagy [32] .

In autophagy-protein-deficient cells, HCV and influenza A virus induce apoptosis, suggesting that autophagy promotes the survival of infected cells [8, 34] .",

These findings are in line with previous reports showing that several cell types infected with CP BVDV induce IFN-I synthesis [21, 22] , whereas NCP BVDV-infected primary macrophages and MDBK cells display inhibition of IFN-I synthesis [23] . However, IFN-I induction and signaling were enhanced when Beclin1 was silenced in CP-and NCP-BVDVinfected MDBK cells (Fig. 7) . The RIG-like receptor (RLR) induction pathway signals exclusively through IRF3, which is typically eliminated in BVDV-infected cells through the effect of BVDV N pro in NCP BVDV infection [35] . The results discussed above suggest that the N pro -mediated block of IFN induction in NCP pestivirus infections is bypassed somehow when autophagy is not operating properly. IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 upregulation may then occur independently of IRF3 and may, for instance, involve PKR, although these pathways are not completely resolved yet [36] . The particularly high levels of OAS1 mRNA found in shBCN cells infected with CP BVDV may point in that direction. Therefore we intend to investigate further whether the elimination of IRF3 in the presence of BVDV is altered when autophagy is disrupted.",

Together, our studies suggest new strategies to treat or prevent mucosal diseases caused by BVDV infection. However, the mechanism by which BVDVinfected MDBK-induced autophagy inhibit the IFN signalling pathway and apoptosis remains unclear. Further investigation of this phenomenon is currently underway.",
