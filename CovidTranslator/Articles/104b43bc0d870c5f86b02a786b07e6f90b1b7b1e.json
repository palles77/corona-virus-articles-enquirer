COVID-19 is now clearly achieving pandemic status, a situation that is especially alarming considering that there is no effective vaccine yet available.

In effect, this is an integrated human-environment system characterised by complex interactions and feedbacks [8] . To contain and control infectious diseases such as COVID-19, in addition to extensive medical treatment, systematic methods need to be carried out to isolate the source of infection, cut off transmission routes, and protect vulnerable groups. Based on the ''classification-coordination-collaboration\" approach of advancing sustainable development goals [9] , the systematic approaches towards fighting COVID-19 adopted by China can be summarized as a combination of actions involving coordination, classification, and collaboration ( Fig. 1 ).",

            "text": "(1) Coordination. Coordination in this context refers to the organization of the medical team and resources needed to combat the epidemic, with government as the lead actor. Following formal confirmation of the gravity of COVID-19 and its deleterious health impacts on January 20th, 2020, the Chinese government implemented a coordinated topdown organization system to allocate and manage critical resources (http://cpc.people.com.cn/n1/2020/0223/c64094-31600380.html). For example, to improve the recovery rate and reduce mortality in Hubei Province, the central government immediately coordinated a number of different agencies, and quickly operationalized several specialized treatment hospitals within a very short period, including the construction of completely new Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals. Meanwhile, until February 23rd 2020, more than 330 medical teams, comprising 41,600 medical staff from 29 provinces, including military health personnel, were temporarily assigned to Hubei Province to contribute to the treatment of patients (http://news. cctv.com/2020/03/01/ARTIyFaDgjnVVFUmkVuatpaz200301. shtml). The central government also established a ''green channel\" transportation for medical supplies and other material resources after the shutdown of the regular transport system in Wuhan. (2) Classification. Classification is employed to divide the outbreak areas and their associated risk factors into different levels, which consider the number of confirmed cases and the factors closely related to disease transmission, including population characteristics and the living environment. After the confirmation of Human-to-human transmission [10] , in response to the proliferation of the epidemic, differential prevention and control measures were adopted informed by a risk level detailed at the county scale. The central government, from January 23rd 2020, implemented a ''closed management\" policy in Wuhan [11] and six other cities in Hubei Province through closure of train stations, airports and highways that strictly controlled population mobility. Localities in cities that would typically have been crowded were closed to prevent asymptomatic patients from transmitting the virus. On February 17th 2020, to ensure an orderly return to work after the Spring Festival holiday during the containing COVID-19 process, the Chinese government issued a document stating that all provinces (except Hubei and Beijing) should declare the epidemic risk level for their counties based on the number of confirmed cases, evaluated as ''low\", ''medium\" and ''high\" risk levels Through the coordination, classification, and collaboration (3C) systematic approach, China has been able to curb the spread of the COVID-19 nationally. It is notable that these three processes are not independent but interrelated. For example, classification requires collaboration between different government agencies at different administrative levels, which in turn helps to strengthen management coordination. In addition, effective implementation of policies is inseparable from collaboration between different departments. Moreover, spontaneous collaboration behaviors among the general public (bottom-up) requires appropriate guidance from the government (top-down). In order to deal with the huge challenges of human-environmental systems, the systematic approach needs to fully consider the interaction between different agencies and actors.",

Considering the population density and climatic conditions of different countries, zoning management is important and this needs to be adjusted in time according to the risk level of the epidemic to avoid the negative effects of strict management. Secondly, governments of countries need to strive for a unified and equitable allocation of resources and to improve the efficiency of resource distribution through coordinated management. At global scale, beyond the WHO, collaborative international organizations such as the United Nations (UN) should unite different subordinate departments to cooperatively develop global management plans, thereby suggesting countermeasures for countries. Thirdly, the education, participation and support of all members of society is essential to defeating the epidemic. As such, governments have the responsibility and obligation to take measures that foster the willingness of the broader population to collaborate. It is also very important to publish accurate information about infection status in a timely manner and to actively seek collaboration with the international community.",
