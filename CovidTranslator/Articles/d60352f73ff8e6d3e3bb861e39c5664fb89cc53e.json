The antiviral effects of AmB result not only from an alteration of the viral envelope by its combining with sterol componants [9] but also from enhancement of interferon (IFN) production in host cells [2] . Human coronavirus has been found to be inactivated by AmB [6] . On the other hand, AmB reportedly enhances viral RNA infectivity [3] . Since cell cultures for virological studies very often require antibiotics for prevention of fungus contamination, our aim was to further clarify the effect of these compounds, namely fongizione, AmB and DOC, upon virus infectivity using the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TOEV).",

At that concentration, we also found that DOC inactivated TOEV by more than 99.99 % (data not shown). At lower concentrations \u00ab 5 fLg/ml), DOC did not inactivate TOBV infectivity. The concentration of chemicals used in the present study (2 fLg/ml) was chosen because it is usually used to prevent fungal contamination in cell cultures. AmB (at a lower concentration than 5 fLg/ml) also did not inactivate TOBV infectivity. However, when AmB and DOC were combined, they were found to have an effect similar to that of fongizone, These results are consistent with those observed by DeVald et al. [6] and Kessler et al. [10] , but not with results obtained by Jordan and Seet (1978) , who claimed that fongizone at a concentration of 2 fLg/ml did not affect enveloped virus infectivity. However, Kessler et al. [10] claimed that AmB inactivated hepatitis B virus, when they used fongizone, a compound comprising AmB and DOC. It can be assumed that AmB alters the viral envelope by creating pores, similar to treated eukaryote cell membranes [7, 8, 15] . However, this alteration is not sufficient to inactivate virus infectivity; DOC is required to complete inactivation once these pores have been produced, or vice-versa. A synergic effect may also be the mechanism of action of the two substances. TOEV is known to induce IFN [11, 12] ; in our study, IFN production was found to be unchanged by the addition of fongizone or AmB (table I) ; therefore, virus inactivation cannot be explained by an enhanced production of IFN which, in turn, inactivated virus multiplication.",

In recent studies (to be published), we found that with similar inocula, TOEV induced a plaque number nearly three-fold higher in ST cells than in RPD cells, independently of the virus strain used. In the present study, viral RNA penetration was found to be facilitated by ArnB, and therefore more plaques were observed in ST cells. It is possible that a similar reaction occurred in RPD cells, but virus replication remained limited in these cells. However, there is no satisfactory explanation for the enhancing effect of AmB on plaque formation when DOC was jointly added, nor can we explain why, in contrast, AmB plus DOC (fongizone) in agar-overlay medium inactivated TOEV and therefore limited plaque size development, but did not do so in the liquid MEM used for virus growth.",
