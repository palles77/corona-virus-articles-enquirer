Open reading frame 3 (ORF3) is the only accessory gene in the PEDV genome. Previous studies have indicated that PEDV vaccine strains have a partial deletion in ORF3. In this study, a nanoparticle-assisted polymerase chain reaction (nanoparticle-assisted RT-PCR) assay targeting the ORF3 of PEDV was developed to distinguish PEDV field strains from attenuated strains by using a specific pair of primers. The PCR products of field strains and attenuated strains were 264 bp and 215 bp in length, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay were also assessed. The nanoparticle-assisted RT-PCR assay was 10-100 times more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR assay, with no cross-reactions when amplifying porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine parvovirus (PPV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine rotavirus (RV), and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). The nanoparticle-assisted RT-PCR assay we describe here can be used to distinguish field strains from vaccine strains of PEDV, and it shows promise for reducing economic loss due to PEDV infection.",

Its main clinical features are vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration and high mortality in suckling piglets [1] . In the 1970s, PEDV first appeared in the United Kingdom [2] . Subsequently, it was reported in Europe and Asia [3, 4] . Since 2010, PEDV has caused large-scale diarrhea outbreaks in pigs and a 80-100 % fatality rate in suckling piglets in China [5, 6] . Recently, a PEDV outbreak has rapidly swept throughout the United States in less than a year [7, 8] . PEDV has lead to significant economic losses worldwide, but there has been no specific or effective method available to keep the spread of PEDV under control [9] .",

Open reading frame 3 (ORF3) is the only accessory gene in the PEDV genome. The ORF3 of PEDV has an important role in virulence. Some studies have shown that the coronavirus ORF3-encoded protein forms an ion channel and modulates virus release, and ORF3 gene silencing can reduce viral titers in Vero cells [11, 12] . Further research has shown that deletions are present in ORF3 of cell-adapted PEDV strains when compared to field strains [13, 14] . In Asia, vaccines based on attenuated PEDV strains have been approved [13, 15] , including the CV777 and ZJ08 strains in China, the P-5V strain in Japan, and the KPED-9 and DR13 strains in South Korea. These cell-adapted vaccine strains have a 49-bp deletion in the ORF3 gene. This feature can be used to distinguish natural field strains from attenuated vaccine strains.",

These approaches have their own disadvantages. Electron microscopy and virus isolation are highly specific and sensitive, but they are timeconsuming. Samples get contaminated easily in the LAMP assays, and real-time RT-PCR requires special instruments. In this study, a nanoparticle-assisted RT-PCR assay was developed to distinguish PEDV field strains from vaccine strains. Similar to conventional RT-PCR assays, this method showed improved sensitivity and specificity. The advanced nanoparticle-assisted RT-PCR uses metal particles to create a better thermal conductivity environment, thereby reducing nonspecific amplification and facilitating specific amplification. Moreover, the nanoparticle-assisted RT-PCR assay does not require specialized instruments, in contrast to the real-time RT-PCR assay [20] .",

            "text": "PEDV causes serious disease and economic loss in the pig industry [21] . Inactivated vaccines are effective for controlling the disease. However, PEDV has been found to appear in immunized pigs since 2006 [21] . Since 2010, PEDV outbreaks have led to 100 % mortality in newborn piglets throughout southern China, during which time more than 1 million pigs have died [22] . In diarrheal piglets, the positive rate for PEDV is significantly higher than that for porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine rotavirus [5, 23] , suggesting that PEDV is the main pathogen causing the diarrhea in China. Attenuated strains are applied for vaccination in many Asian countries, including China. The traditional identification methods may not provide accurate distinction of the attenuated vaccine strain for the field strain. The nanoparticle-assisted RT-PCR assay has been used for rapid and accurate detection of other pig viruses [24] [25] [26] . The present study demonstrated that an effective nanoparticle-assisted RT-PCR assay targeting the ORF3 gene of PEDV was able to distinguish field strains from attenuated vaccine strains. This method was more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR assay and suitable for testing clinical samples with low viral loads. The assay was specific for PEDV, exhibiting no cross-reactivity against other viruses. The method could effectively distinguish the PEDV field strains and the attenuated vaccine strains in the clinical samples. When testing clinical samples, in one case, a vaccine strain was found to coexist with a virulent strain. The reason for this phenomenon might be the failure of vaccine immunization, suggesting that there were potential threats of PEDV infection after vaccination. In addition to this, there are concerns about the safety of the live attenuated PED vaccine for use in pregnant gilts and sows because a live attenuated vaccine virus might be able to revert to virulence under field conditions. nanoparticle-assisted RT-PCR assay (B) for detection of the attenuated vaccine strain ZJ08.
