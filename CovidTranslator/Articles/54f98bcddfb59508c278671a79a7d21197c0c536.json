            "text": "Protein sequence alignments have become an important tool for molecular biologists. Local alignments are frequently constructed with the aid of a \"substitution score matrix\" that specifies a score for aligning each pair of amino acid residues. Over the years, many different substitution matrices have been proposed, based on a. wide variety of rationales. Statistical results, however, demonstrate that any such matrix is implicitly a \"log-odds\" matrix. with a specific target distribution for aligned pairs of amino acid residues. In the light of information theory, it is possible to express the scores of a substitution matrix in bits and to see that different matrices are better adapted to different purposes. The most widely used matrix for protein sequence comparison has been the PAM-250 matrix. It is argued that for database searches the PAM-120 matrix generally is more appropriate, while for comparing two specific proteins with suspected homology the PAM-200 matrix is indicated. Examples discussed include the lipocalins, human cr,B-glycoprotein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and the globins.",

            "text": "General methods for protein sequence comparison were introduced to molecular biology 20 years ago and have since gained widespread use. Most early attempts t'o measure protein sequence similarity focused on global sequence alignments, in which every residue of the two sequences compared had to participate (Needleman & Wunsch, 1970; Sellers, 1974; Sankoff 8r. Kruskal, 1983) . However, because distantly related proteins may share only isolated regions of similarity, e.g. in the vicinity of an active site, attention has shifted to local as opposed to global sequence similarity measures. The basic idea is to consider only relatively conserved subsequences; dissimilar regions do not contribute to or subtract from the measure of similarity. Local similarity may be studied in a variety of ways. These include measures based on the longest matching segmems of two sequences with a specified number or proportion of mismatches (Arratia et aE., 1986; Arratia & Waterman, 1989) , as well as methods that compare all segments of a fixed, predefined \"window\" length (McLachlan, 1971) . The most common practice, however, is to consider segments of all lengt,hs. and choose those that optimize a similarity measure (Smith & Waterman. 1981; Goad & Kanehisa, 1982; Sellers, 1984) . This has the advantage of placing no a priori restrictions on the length of the local alignments sought. Most database search methods have been based on such local alignments (Lipman & Pearson, 1985; Pearson & Lipman, 1988; Altschul et al., 1990) .",

There is a fundamental difference. however, between the use of such trrat,rices in these two (sontexts. For global alignments, as previously, multiplying all scores by a fixed positive number has no effect on the relative scores of different alignments. But adding a fixed cluantit,y (I to the score for aligning any pair of residues (and (l/2 to the score for aligning a residue with a null) likewise has no effect. Scoring systems I hat may be t,ransformed into one another by means of t,hese two rules are, for all practical purposes, equivalent llnfortunately, the new transformation tneans that no unique log-odds interpretation of global substitution mat,rices is possible, and it is doubtful that any \"target distribution\" theorem can be proved. It may be possible to make a convincing case for a particular substitution matrix in the global alignment context, but the argument will most likely have to be different from that for local alignments (Karlin & Altschul. 1990 ). The sa,me applies t,o substitution matrices used with fixed-length windows for studying local similarities (SlcLachlan, 1971; Argos, 1987; Storm0 & Hartzell, 19X9) : a fixed quantity can be added to all entries of such a matrix with no essential effect,.

It will be noticed that the highest chance PAM-250 scores are consistently slightly smaller than the highest chance PAM-120 scores. This is primarily attributable to the fact that the parameter K discussed above is about half as large for the former scores as for the latter. Furthermore. since neither the PIR database nor a given query sequence ever precisely fits the random protein model described by Dayhoff et al.

When the PIR databa,se is searched with A30300, many related proteins may be identified easily using either t,hc PAM-250 or the PAM-120 substitution matrix. However, several distant' relationships present are harder to detect. In Table 7 are shown four optimal PAM-250 alignments, representing homologies to each of the two A30300 nucleotide-binding folds. Xone of these alignments has a PAM-250 score as great as the highest chance score of 31.3 bits.

So biologically significant similarity is distinguished by the PAM-250 matrix that is not found using the PAM-120.

In order to detect short but strong homologies or long but weak ones, this matrix can be complemented by the PAM-40 and PAM-250 matrices; additional matrices should be of only marginal utility. Of course, many database search methods, such as the FASTA programs (Lipman h Pearson, 1985; Pearson & Lipman, 1988) . seek locaal alignments with gaps, and such measures are potrntially more sensitive to distant homologies. Unfortunately. if gaps wit,h associated scores are allowecl, the specific quantitative discussion above is no longer correct.

Scores can be assigned to aligned dresidues or t)ri-residues: they can depend on alignment length (Altschul 8t Erikson. 1986): or they can be complex combinations of various scoring methods (Argos, 1987) . Protein databases may also be searcshed with position-dependent scores or \"profiles\" constructed from multiple alignments (Taylor, 1986; Gribskov et al., 1987 : Patthy, 1987 . In certain contexts such systems may well be morp sensitive than the straightforward local scoring system considered here. Two advantages of simple additive scores are their amenability to powerf'ul algorithmic methods (Altschul et al.. 1990) and to rigorous statistical analysis (Karlin $ Altschul. 1990 : Karlin et al., 1990 . Such analysis ma? also yield insight into the properties of more c~ompllc*atet-l scoring scahemes.",
