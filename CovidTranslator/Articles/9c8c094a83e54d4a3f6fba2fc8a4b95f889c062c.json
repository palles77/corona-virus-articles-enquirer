            "text": "Neurotropic viruses infect the central nervous system (CNS) and cause acute or chronic neurologic disabilities. Regulatory T cells (Treg) play a critical role for immune homeostasis, but may inhibit pathogen-specific immunity in infectious disorders. The present review summarizes the current knowledge about Treg in human CNS infections and their animal models. Besides dampening pathogen-induced immunopathology, Treg have the ability to facilitate protective responses by supporting effector T cell trafficking to the infection site and the development of resident memory T cells. Moreover, Treg can reduce virus replication by inducing apoptosis of infected macrophages and attenuate neurotoxic astrogliosis and pro-inflammatory microglial responses. By contrast, detrimental effects of Treg are caused by suppression of antiviral immunity, allowing for virus persistence and latency. Opposing disease outcomes following Treg manipulation in different models might be attributed to differences in technique and timing of intervention, infection route, genetic background, and the host's age. In addition, mouse models of virus-induced demyelination revealed that Treg are able to reduce autoimmunity and immune-mediated CNS damage in a disease phase-dependent manner. Understanding the unique properties of Treg and their complex interplay with effector cells represents a prerequisite for the development of new therapeutic approaches in neurotropic virus infections.",

Although most viral infections are self-limiting and asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts, some neurotropic viruses can cause acute and fatal or severely debilitating inflammation. Moreover, virus persistence or long-term neurologic disabilities, as well as an increased risk of developing epilepsy, can be observed in patients surviving acute viral encephalitis [1] [2] [3] . CNS lesion development and disease outcome depends on host factors (e.g., age, gender, immunogenetics) and viral properties. Virus infection of the CNS typically leads to lymphocytic inflammation, glial activation, and tissue damage, including necrosis and demyelination (Table 1) . Besides direct virus-induced cytopathology, several neurologic disorders are caused by excessive antiviral immune responses [3] . Certain pathogens, including herpesviruses, are also suspected triggers of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis, or Guillain.

Thus, despite the need for protection against viral invasion and replication, the extent of the immune response in the CNS needs to be carefully regulated to prevent bystander tissue damage and immunopathology. Regulatory T cells (Treg), a cluster of differentiation (CD)4 + T cell subset with immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory functions, are principle regulators of immune reactions and mediators of peripheral tolerance. They contribute to tissue homeostasis under steady state conditions and regulate immune responses in inflammatory diseases [33, 34] . Immunomodulation represents a promising new application for treating autoimmune and infectious diseases, including neurologic disorders. Mechanisms to enhance regulatory T cell function in order to prevent pathogen-induced, immune-mediated tissue damage as well as approaches to reduce their function to strengthen protective immunity and vaccination immunogenicity have been proposed [35] [36] [37] . The present review summarizes the current knowledge on Treg involvement in human CNS infections and the effects of Treg manipulation in experimental models of human neutrotropic virus infection and virus-induced demyelination.",

            "text": "Prevention of immunopathology in the course of inflammation and maintenance of self-tolerance requires mechanisms that dampen deleterious immune responses. Several cell types with regulatory functions have been described, including CD4 + CD25 + forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3) + regulatory T cells (Treg), type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1 cells), invariant natural killer T cells, double negative CD3 + helper cells, \u03b3\u03b4-T cells, CD8 + Foxp3 + T cells, regulatory B cells, and myeloid suppressor cells. Among them, Treg are the most-studied and well-characterized cell type, and their paramount importance for immune homeostasis has been amply demonstrated [38] [39] [40] [41] . Defects in the gene coding for the Treg-specific transcription factor forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3) lead to an aggressive and fatal autoimmune disorder known as immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome (IPEX) in humans and a comparable systemic lymphoproliferative disease in scurfy mutant mice [42, 43] . Besides their role in peripheral tolerance to the self, Treg are also involved in the suppression of excessive immune responses evoked by commensal microbiota and invading pathogens [44, 45] . There are two main types of Treg: natural Treg (nTreg) are generated in the thymus, whereas induced Treg (iTreg) arise de novo from na\u00efve CD4 + T cells in the periphery upon Foxp3 induction mediated by interleukin (IL)-2 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 signaling ( Figure 1a ) [46, 47] . Treg exert inhibitory functions on a variety of immune cells, including T and B cells, natural killer cells, and cells of the innate immune system via cell contact-dependent and -independent mechanisms ( Figure 1b) . For instance, Treg show a high expression of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), which competes with CD28 for the co-stimulatory molecules B7-1 and B7-2 on antigen-presenting cells and thereby prevents T cell priming. Treg require IL-2 derived from other cell sources as a growth and survival factor and constitutively express CD25, which is a part of high affinity IL-2 receptors [48] [49] [50] . Owing to that, they can deprive other T cells of IL-2, which suppresses their activation and effector function [51] . Interestingly, although Treg restrict the population of CD8 + effector T cells, they promote the formation of memory T cells in viral infections of the CNS (see below). The most important Treg-secreted soluble mediators are the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-\u03b2, which can induce a plethora of immunomodulatory downstream effects on a variety of responsive cell types. Treg also express the ectoenzymes ATP apyrase (CD39) and ecto-5 -adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-nucleotidase (CD73), which generate the immunosuppressive purine nucleoside adenosine. Moreover, Treg are capable of directly killing syngeneic cells such as T cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells through granzyme/perforin and caspase-3-involving pathways [52] [53] [54] [55] . This ability is not only important for the limitation of overwhelming immune responses but can also facilitate virus elimination through the execution of infected macrophages, as was shown in the murine human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV)-encephalitis model (see below). Moreover, there is cumulating evidence that distinct subtypes of Treg exist in certain tissue environments (e.g., skin and CNS) and that Treg in those niches might be equipped with additional, site-specific effector functions and induce responses beyond immune regulation [56, 57] .",

Moreover, functional inactivation of Treg is possible using antibodies directed against CD25 (clone PC61) [60] . Enhancement of Treg responses is achieved by adoptive transfer of Treg or by expansion of endogenous Treg using IL-2 immune complexes (IL-2C, consisting of recombinant IL-2 and anti-IL-2-antibodies, clone JES6-1), which selectively expand cells expressing CD25 [34, 61, 62] . The approaches targeting CD25 have the disadvantage of simultaneous inactivation or expansion of other cells transiently expressing CD25 (e.g. activated T cells) [61, 63] , whereas Foxp3 is highly specific for the Treg population.",

            "text": "Treg function in inflammatory disorders is commonly investigated by depletion/inactivation or increase of Treg numbers in mice. To that end, two types of transgenic knock-in mice were developed, which express the human or simian diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) under control of the Foxp3 promoter and allow a specific Treg depletion upon DT injection (Foxp3 DTR or depletion of regulatory T cells (DEREG) mice) [58, 59] . Moreover, functional inactivation of Treg is possible using antibodies directed against CD25 (clone PC61) [60] . Enhancement of Treg responses is achieved by adoptive transfer of Treg or by expansion of endogenous Treg using IL-2 immune complexes (IL-2C, consisting of recombinant IL-2 and anti-IL-2-antibodies, clone JES6-1), which selectively expand cells expressing CD25 [34, 61, 62] . The approaches targeting CD25 have the disadvantage of simultaneous inactivation or expansion of other cells transiently expressing CD25 (e.g. activated T cells) [61, 63] , whereas Foxp3 is highly specific for the Treg population. (a) There are two main types of Treg in humans and mice. Natural Treg (nTreg) are generated in the thymus from precursor T cells recognizing self-antigens presented by thymic antigen presenting cells (APC) via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II molecules. The differentiation to the Treg phenotype is further influenced by local cytokines. nTreg express high levels of Helios and neuropilin-1 (Nrp1). Treg can also be generated de novo from na\u00efve conventional cluster of differentiation (CD)4 + T cells in extrathymic tissues in the presence of interleukin (IL)-2, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, and retinoic acid following T cell receptor (TCR) engagement. These induced Treg (iTreg) express low levels of Helios and Nrp1. Both Treg types are characterized by the expression of the transcription factor forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3) and CD25. (b) Treg exert their suppressive function by various cell contact-dependent and -independent mechanisms. These include cytotoxic T-lymphocyteassociated protein 4 (CTLA-4)-dependant suppression of B7-mediated co-stimulation of conventional T cells (Tconv), Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3)-mediated suppression of dendritic cell (DC) maturation, IL-2 deprivation of other T cells through expression of high-affinity IL-2 receptors (IL2R), and generation of the immunosuppressive nucleotide adenosine by the ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73. Moreover, Treg secrete the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, and IL-35, and induce apoptosis of inflammatory cells through granzyme/perforin secretion. Treg also shift macrophage polarization from M1 to the M2 type and induce the activity of the immunosuppressive enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in DCs.",

The beneficial impact of Treg functions in the context of autoimmune CNS disorders has been extensively studied in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for human MS. Treg have been shown to suppress encephalitogenic T cells, resulting in sustained self-tolerance [64] . Besides exerting modulatory effects in peripheral lymphoid organs, infiltrating Treg directly influence the local inflammatory milieu in the CNS [65, 66] . The choroid plexus is thought to favor the entrance of Treg and T helper (Th)17 cells, whereas the blood-brain barrier may favor the CNS recruitment of Th1 cells and memory T cells [67] . Chemokine ligands (CCL)1 and CCL20 produced by astrocytes and oligodendrocytes initially attract Treg, as shown in ischemic brains [33] . Moreover, CCL22 secretion by activated microglia leads to an enhanced CNS migration of Treg [68, 69] . Recently, a distinct cerebral Treg population has been described, which differs from peripheral Treg in the gene expression pattern. Brain Treg express the transcription factor Helios, killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 (KLRG1), and the serotonin receptor 7, as well as high levels of CTLA-4, ST2 (IL-33 receptor subunit), and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) [33] . It remains undetermined whether these Treg are locally instructed within the brain to adopt tissue-specific properties or whether specific subsets of Treg are selectively recruited to the CNS [57, 58] . Treg-expansion in the CNS is driven by IL-2, the alarmin IL-33, and the neurotransmitter serotonin. IL-33 and serotonin are constitutively expressed in the CNS and are able to substitute the role of IL-2 in mediating Treg survival and maintenance, for example under post-inflammatory conditions [33] .",

Moreover, Treg are involved in CNS regeneration: Treg-derived cellular network communication factor 3 (CCN3) promotes (re)myelination and differentiation of mature oligodendrocytes in vitro, and IL-10 induces proliferation and differentiation of neuronal stem cells in vivo. Neurons and microglia can induce Foxp3-expression and a regulatory phenotype in CD4 + T cells (green arrows) through secretion of TGF-\u03b2 and B7/CD28 interaction or secretion of IL-10 in combination with low expression of costimulatory molecules, respectively. In addition, several factors secreted by glial and neuronal cells promote CNS infiltration of peripheral Treg (not depicted, for details see main text).",

As shown by proteome analyses, co-cultivation with Treg modulates microglial activity in vitro, including inhibition of oxidative stress, cell migration, phagocytosis, and cytokine production. Treg are able to induce apoptosis of activated microglia [71, 72] . Moreover, Treg induce a neuroprotective M2-phenotype of microglia with reduced production of neurotoxic factors, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitric oxide [70, 73, 74] . Brain Treg also suppress neurotoxic astrogliosis through secretion of the low-affinity epidermal growth factor receptor ligand amphiregulin (AREG), as observed in ischemic stroke mouse models. In contrast to other non-lymphoid tissues (e.g. intestine), the CNS is an immune-privileged compartment and largely devoid of Treg in steady state. However, a population of T cell receptor (TCR)\u03b1\u03b2 + CD4 + Foxp3 + Treg has been found in the CNS of normal rats under non-inflammatory conditions, located mainly in the cerebral cortex. These Treg cells show an activated/memory phenotype characterized by the expression of inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS, also referred to as CD278), CD103, KLRG1, and CTLA-4. They express high levels of IL-10 and have the ability to suppress conventional T cells and restrain pro-inflammatory responses of microglia/macrophages in vitro [75] .",

Cytokine secretion and activation state of CNS myeloid cells directly influence T cell polarity. As found in vitro, IL-10 expression in microglia together with reduced expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80) promoted de novo induction of Foxp3 and the proliferation of pre-existing Treg in co-cultured CD4 + T cells [76] . These data indicate that mild CNS inflammation with low interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 levels induce a tolerogenic phenotype of microglia that favors expansion of Treg in the CNS. Similarly, co-incubation of astrocytes and lymphocytes induces T cells with suppressive properties, and supports the polarization of CD4 + T cells into Treg in vitro [77, 78] . Astrocytes sustain Foxp3 expression in Treg through IL2/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5 signaling [75] . Moreover, interaction between neurons and T cells results in conversion of autoreactive T cells to Treg, which requires TGF-\u03b2 [69] . Interestingly, adoptive transfer of Treg generated in glial and neuronal co-cultures suppresses encephalitogenic T cells and reduces the severity of EAE in rodents [69, 76, 78] . Although the extent to which peripheral T cells convert in the brain in autoimmune conditions is discussed controversially [79, 80] , these data indicate that Treg expansion is influenced by the crosstalk between lymphocytes and resident cells and the inflammatory environment in the CNS.",

            "text": "The role of Treg in the pathogenesis of systemic HIV infection remains controversial. Treg have been suggested to suppress retrovirus-specific immunity and inhibit viral clearance. In contrast, others describe a beneficial effect of Treg and their involvement in the inhibition of immune hyperactivation and control of viral load [35, 94] . In a murine model of HIV encephalitis, protective effects of Treg on neuropathology and viral load were observed (Table 2) . Herein, adoptively transferred green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled CD4 + CD25 + Treg migrated across the blood-brain barrier and accumulated at sites of virus-induced inflammation in the murine brain [92] . The adoptive transfer of Treg into HIV-infected mice prevented neuronal damage. This was associated with reduced CD4 + T cell numbers, astrogliosis, microglial responses, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 expression and oxidative stress in the CNS. Moreover, transferred Treg enhanced the secretion of brain-derived (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in infected rodents [93] . Using murine and human primary cell cultures, Treg have been shown to reduce iNOS and elevate arginase-1 protein levels in HIV-infected macrophages, indicating a switch from a neurotoxic M1 phenotype toward a M2 phenotype. These transformed myeloid cells were shown to exhibit neuroprotective properties in vitro, such as preserving dendrite morphology of cultured neurons [55] . Strikingly, Treg are also able to reduce viral loads in the brain of HIV-infected mice by increasing apoptosis of HIV-infected macrophages [93] . In vitro, Treg inhibited viral replication and release and actively killed HIV-infected macrophages by caspase-3 and perforin/granzyme-dependent pathways. The lethal effect on macrophages was markedly higher in infected compared to non-infected cells. In addition, co-cultivation with Treg induced proteomic changes in HIV-1-infected macrophages, characterized by upregulation of proteins related to antiviral immune responses, apoptosis, cell shape/motility, and metabolism, indicating that Treg function by a broad range of mechanisms to modulate the outcome of retroviral infection [55] .",

However, when treatment is delayed (\u2265 4 dpi), encephalitis escalates despite drug-induced virus control [110] . In a study conducted in mice receiving aciclovir at 4 days post HSV-1 infection, neuroprotective effects of Treg were demonstrated. Oral administration of Bacteroides fragilis polysaccharide A, an immunomodulatory bacterial component, induced CD39 + CD73 + Treg and protected mice from fatal encephalitis following HSV-1 infection and delayed antiviral treatment. The bacterial symbiosis factor promoted IL-10 secretion by Treg and other cells, which restrained myeloid cell infiltration in the brain stem and pathogenic innate immune responses.

MCMV encephalitis is a model for long-term neuroinflammation, characterized by immune cell infiltration from the periphery, activation of microglia, and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which persists even in the absence of detectable viral antigen. The inflammation is accompanied by local Treg accumulation, which is enhanced by IL-10-secreting B cells [111] . In the MCMV model, Treg prevented chronic neurologic dysfunction by controlling the development of reactive astro-and microgliosis in infected mice. It has been shown that Foxp3-depletion during acute MCMV infection enhances chronic glial cell responses, which heightens hippocampal damage and cognitive impairment in the post-encephalic phase [101, 111] . Furthermore, Treg support the transition of effector T cells to tissue resident memory T cell in the CNS following MCMV infection. This CD103 + CD8 + memory T cell population in MCMV-infected mice shows an enhanced cytotoxic activity (granzyme B release) upon antigen re-stimulation, which has the potential to control reinfection and reactivation of latent or persistent infection [102] .",

However, dependent on the infection route, positive effects on local immune responses have also been demonstrated. This indicates that Treg might have different functions in distinct tissue sites. In scenarios with reduced viral replication (e.g., with concurrent antiviral treatment or in chronic MCMV infection), Treg seem to exert predominantly beneficial effects, as they ameliorate fatal immunopathology and aid in the establishment of immunologic memory.",

West Nile virus (WNV) infection of humans is asymptomatic in approximately80% of cases and leads to a self-limiting febrile illness (West Nile fever) in the remaining 20%. Less than 1% of individuals develop a severe and potentially life-threatening neuroinvasive disease, which can result in long-term neurologic impairment in survivors [3, 113] . The host factors responsible for development of neurologic disease are still largely elusive. On the one hand, an ineffective antiviral immune response can lead to neuroinvasion and virus persistence in the CNS, causing direct and indirect inflammation-induced damage. Long-term persistence of viral RNA has been reported following WNV infection and WNV-specific immunglobin M( IgM) antibodies have been detected up to 5 months post-infection in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with neurologic symptoms, indicating that virus persistence might be at least in part responsible for disease [114, 115] . On the other hand, there is evidence that clinical disease is the result of immune-mediated damage caused by excessive immune responses, rather than neuroinvasion alone [116, 117] .",

Approximately 50% of survivors develop serious neuropsychiatric sequelae, which are considered more fatal than WNV infection, given the fatality rate of 3%-5% [3] . Many aspects of the pathogenesis have been deciphered in rodent models of the disease. Following infection, JEV replicates in dendritic cells and macrophages in the periphery. CNS invasion is considered as the consequence of immune escape of the virus and crossing of the blood-brain barrier. Although JEV is able to kill neurons directly, it is also believed that an impaired blood-brain barrier and excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL6 and TNF-a by infiltrating monocytes and activated microglia, markedly contribute to neuropathology and disease development [118, 119] .",

Moreover, these patients showed generally elevated, dysregulated, and atypically polarized T cell responses, which could be secondary to a diminished Treg function [116] . Therefore, a robust early Treg expansion might protect from symptomatic disease through dampening WNV-specific immune responses and associated immune-mediated damage [103, 117] . The limitations of these studies are that samples were collected after infection of an unknown duration, and assessment of the pre-infection Treg levels was not possible. Moreover, the analysis of peripheral blood samples might not ideally reflect the situation in the CNS.

Moreover, mice depleted of Treg prior to infection show increased neurologic disease symptoms and mortality following WNV infection [103] . Strikingly, although Treg-ablated mice exhibited higher frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-producing, virus-specific T cells in the CNS during acute WNV infection, memory CD8 + T cell responses were impaired in later phases. Treg-mediated production of TGF-\u03b2 resulted in an increase in CD103 + CD8 + resident memory T cells in the brain at 60 dpi, indicating that Treg are able to maintain the brain resident memory population and potentiate antiviral immunity in WNV infection. Importantly, the effects on memory T cells were observed despite the fact that Treg depletion was only transient and performed prior to infection. The authors hypothesized that following infection, Treg might function to suppress a vigorous antiviral immune response to limit tissue damage at the cost of rapid virus clearance, but simultaneously protect the host from uncontrolled replication of persisting virus by aiding the development of a tissue resident memory T cell population [104] . This was supported by an experiment performed in mice on a broader genetic background. In order to identify factors that predispose to neuroinvasion and/or clinical disease, WNV infection was investigated using the collaborative cross (CC), composed of many different recombinant mouse lines with high levels of genetic variation, which models genetic diversity found in human populations. Similar to humans, individual CC strains show variable outcomes following WNV infection in terms of survival, clinical disease score, viral titer, and innate and adaptive immune responses in peripheral tissues and the CNS [121, 122] . A correlation analysis of the infection outcome and immunophenotype suggests beneficial and detrimental effects of Treg, depending on the investigated parameter and time-point. Regarding the distribution and persistence of virus in CNS tissues, Treg seems to play a detrimental role. Reduced expression of activation markers on splenic Treg before infection are associated with peripheral virus restriction, suggesting that reduced suppressive activity of Treg under steady state conditions assists in preventing WNV neuroinvasion [120] . Moreover, an early expansion of splenic Treg with increased expression of CD73, CTLA-4, ICOS, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor TNFR-related protein (GITR), and CD44, as well as CNS migration markers such as CXCR3 and CD29, correlates with the manifestation of chronic WNV infection. An early brain infiltration of CD73 + Treg is associated with reduced cytolysis by natural killer cells and/or CD8 + T cells, likely allowing for viral persistence [122] . Additionally, elevated Treg levels are present in the murine brain during persistent WNV infection [123] .",

CCR5 ablation in JEV-infected mice exacerbated encephalitis symptoms and mortality, which was associated with reduced Treg responses and increased Th17 cell numbers in the brain. Adoptive transfer of CCR5 + Treg into CCR5 \u2212/\u2212 mice during development of encephalitis (3 dpi) reversed the phenomenon by increasing IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 expression in the brain. These data showed a beneficial role of Treg in dampening severe neuroinflammation following JEV infection, which depends on CCR5-mediated homing to the CNS. It is worth mentioning that CCR5 \u2212/\u2212 animals with or without Treg-transfer have similar levels of virus in the CNS compared to JEV-infected wild-type animals, showing that neither CCR5 nor Treg have an impact on virus control and that the effects of the manipulations are unrelated to altered viral replication [105] . Interestingly, loss-of-function mutations in CCR5 are associated with increased disease severity, but not increased susceptibility in WNV-infected humans [125, 126] . Whether this association is also related to CNS homing of Treg remains to be determined. Aside from CNS influx of peripherally generated or activated Treg, local generation of induced Treg might also be involved in ameliorating flaviviral encephalitis.

JEV is thought to manipulate the host's immune system to evade the immune surveillance in the periphery and cross the blood-brain barrier. JEV infection led to disturbed maturation of human and mouse dendritic cells in vitro and ex vivo, which was also associated with elevated IL-10 production, programmed death-ligang 1 (PD-L1) expression, and expansion of the Treg population [128] [129] [130] . In contrast, in vitro dendritic cell infection with attenuated JEV (live vaccine) impaired the expansion of Treg, which might contribute to expansion of effector T cells and development of protective antiviral immunity following vaccination with the strain [131] . Therefore, similar to the situation in WNV infection, an initial induction of Treg putatively facilitates virus spread and neuroinvasion immediately following infection. Thus far, this has only been shown using in vitro or ex vivo culture of DCs. Further experiments are needed to determine the functional significance of JEV-induced Treg expansion in vivo. An association of Treg numbers and antiviral immunity has also been made in an animal experiment applying JEV-infected toll-like receptor (TLR)4-deficient mice. TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed reduced viral CNS burden, lethality, and neuroinflammation, which is associated with enhanced type I IFN innate immunity and virus-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses and reduced Treg numbers. However, it remains unclear whether reduced Treg numbers in this setting are the cause or the effect of decreased CNS infection and inflammation, and further experiments are needed to demonstrate causality [132] .",

In addition, as observed in measles virus (MV)-infected rhesus macaques, Foxp3-expression in blood leukocytes correlated with slow viral clearance and prolonged infection [137] . Treg have been shown to influence the level of MV in the brain of persistently infected mice. In CD150-transgenic mice (which are susceptible to MV infection through the introduction of the human MV-receptor), expansion of splenic Treg and migration of these cells to the areas of viral replication in the brain can be observed following MV infection [138] . Treg survival and function are partly dependent on CD28 signaling. Employing a mouse model of persistent brain infection with recombinant MV, Treg expansion by superagonistic anti-CD28 antibodies (clone D665) during chronic MV infection induced transient immunosuppression and subsequent increase in virus replication and transneuronal spread in the mouse brain. Conversely, Foxp3-ablation in DEREG mice in a similar disease phase enhanced virus-specific CD8 + effector T cell responses in the brain and caused reduction in MV persistence [106, 139] . Acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) deficiency increases the frequency and suppressive activity of Treg. MV infection of Asm-deficient mice led to reduced virus-specific CD8 + T cell responses and relatively enhanced Treg responses, resulting in massive brain infection. Similarly, Asm inhibition by amitriptyline, an antidepressant drug, increases the number of infected neurons in the mouse model persistent brain infection. The increase in viral brain load requires the presence of Treg because Asm inhibitor treatment shows no effect on MV infection in Treg-deprived mice [107] . Interestingly, in this study, Treg-depletion without Asm inhibition did not reproduce the effects on viral replication described in the study by Reuter et al. [106] . This could be due to differences in the protocol of Treg depletion (dose, time-point of DT administration) or due to different genetic backgrounds of used mice (C57BL/6 vs. C57BL/6.129). Because the described model of persistent MV infection did not produce clinically apparent disease and the neuropathologic sequelae were not investigated, the significance of differences in viral replication for neurologic function are unknown. Nevertheless, the reports indicated that manipulation of Treg in the periphery has consequences for the fate of MV infection in the brain. A disproportional increase in Treg compared to conventional T cells causes a poor control in MV infection, which may play a role in establishing persistent MV infection in subacute sclerotizing panencephalitis (SSPE). However, because decreased frequencies of circulating CD152 + Treg have been observed in SSPE patients, the role of peripheral and CNS infiltrating Treg in maintaining persistent MV infection in humans remains unclear [140] .",

Important mouse models to study the pathogenesis of virus-induced demyelination are Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection. Infection with these viruses induces an acute encephalitis phase with virus replication within the CNS, followed by a phase characterized by demyelination, which occurs despite control of viral replication, and is driven by immunopathology or autoimmunity against myelin components. Because Treg-based therapies have been considered as an attractive therapeutic option for demyelinating diseases of humans, the effects of Treg manipulation in the context of virally-induced demyelination has been studied in both models (Tables 3 and 4 ) [143, 144] .",

An unfavorable ratio of Treg to effector T cells during acute infection was proposed to inhibit antiviral cytotoxicity of TME-IDD-susceptible mouse strains, which contributes to TMEV persistence in the spinal cord. This hypothesis was tested in SJL mice by Treg-inactivation prior to TMEV infection using anti-CD25 and anti-GITR antibodies (Table 3 ). Both methods resulted in enhanced antiviral CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses and TMEV-specific antibody production, which led to a reduced viral load in the CNS and delayed onset of neurologic disease [146] . Conversely, application of ex vivo-induced Treg (iTreg) prior to TMEV infection decreased CNS recruitment of leukocytes, resulting in increased virus replication and occurrence of clinical symptoms in the acute infection phase, which is usually asymptomatic. By contrast, Treg transfer during the chronic phase (3-4 weeks post infection) ameliorated demyelinating disease without affecting viral titers. These data showed that Treg have disease phase-dependent functions in the TME model, with detrimental effects on protective antiviral immunity during the initial phase and protective effects during chronic persistent infection, which are presumably mediated by suppression of virus-induced immunopathology [147] . Accordingly, beneficial effects of certain experimental treatments and pharmaceutical agents have been linked to increased Treg functions in the TMEV model. Dysbiosis induced by oral antibiotic administration prevented motor dysfunction and spinal axonopathy in TMEV-infected SJL mice, and the neuroprotective effect involved an enhanced CNS infiltration of CD39 + Treg [148] . Similarly, application of glatiramer acetate, an immunomodulatory drug used in MS treatment, improved clinical disease in TMEV-infected SJL mice with enhanced endogenous Treg responses and IL-10 production, but without affecting antiviral immunity [149] .",

Similarly, Foxp3-ablation in DEREG mice (C57BL/6 background) did not reduce the cerebral virus load, despite enhancing CNS recruitment of IFN-\u03b3 producing T cells [150] . Moreover, adaptive transfer of iTreg or expansion of endogenous Treg with IL-2 immune complexes failed to diminish virus clearance or to induce demyelination in C57BL/6 mice [147, 151] . However, Treg expansion in combination with antibody-mediated CD8-depletion in C57BL/6 mice led to chronic TMEV infection with myelin loss and axonal damage in the spinal cord [151] . The combination of both manipulations resulted in a delayed recovery of depleted CD8 + T cells, which interfered with virus clearance. This finding indicates that, rather than the magnitude of Treg responses alone, the balance of Treg and CD8 + effector T cells instead is crucial to control virus replication upon acute infection. The lack of Treg-mediated effects on antiviral responses indicates that the function of Treg is overridden by the vigorous antiviral CD8 + T cell response in TME-IDD resistant C57BL/6 mice.

The mechanisms, by which Treg exert their suppressive function in early TMEV-infection of SJL mice, remain uncertain. One of the most potent effectors secreted by Treg is IL-10, and elevated levels of the cytokine have been detected in brains of acutely infected SJL mice compared to lower levels in C57BL/6 mice [145] . In TMEV-infected SJL mice treated with antibodies blocking the IL-10 receptor, no positive effect on viral load in the brain or the spinal cord was observed during acute or chronic infection [152, 153] . However, IL-10 blockade resulted in increased hippocampal damage during acute infection, which is usually only minimal or absent in SJL mice [152] . Thus, IL-10 secretion apparently represents a neuroprotective mechanism in acute TMEV-infection, whereas the suppressive effect on antiviral immunity is most likely mediated by other Treg effector functions. mary, detrimental effects of Treg on antiviral immunity depend on the genetic of the animal, timing of manipulation, and the integrity of cytotoxic responses (Table 3) . sms, by which Treg exert their suppressive function in early TMEV-infection of SJL mice, rtain.

Treg seem to be critical for disease attenuation, as Treg transfer protects from fatal encephalitis following infection with highly neurovirulent strains. Moreover, Treg depletion prior to infection increased the mortality in mice infected with attenuated MHV JHM mutant, which usually results in non-lethal infection [154] . Similarly, Treg-depletion prior to acute infection with the attenuated MHV strain A59 led to increased numbers of apoptotic neurons in the brain but did not affect the CNS recruitment of virus-specific CD8 + and CD4 + T cells [155] . The studies indicates that in acute MHV encephalitis, Treg may help to limit immunopathology without inhibiting antiviral immunity [154, 155] . Using tetramer techniques, virus-specific Treg populations expressing IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 have been found in the CNS of mice infected with neuroattenuated MHV. These cells are thought to be thymus-derived natural Treg based on expression of the Helios transcription factor. They showed an activated state at the site of inflammation with high expression levels of CD69, ICOS, and CTLA-4, and had the ability to suppress MHV-specific effector T cells [70] . Using the neuroattenuated MHV strain (rJ2.2), virus-specific Treg have been shown to inhibit effector T cell expansion in lymph nodes and migration of pathogenic CD4 + T cells to the CNS. Adoptive transfer of MHV-specific Treg enhanced the survival rate of infected mice by reducing the frequencies of pathogenic CD4 + T cells and microglial responses in the brain in acute encephalitis [156] .",

            "text": "A beneficial role of Treg has also been observed in chronic demyelinating disease caused by infection with attenuated MHV strains, although some differences have been observed depending on the time of Treg manipulation. Functional Treg inactivation by CD25-treatment prior to acute infection with neuroattenuated MHV strain increased demyelination during viral persistence, indicating that immunopathological processes resulting in myelin destruction are initiated at early stages and that they can be attenuated by Treg [157] . Moreover, the adoptive transfer of na\u00efve Treg after initial effector T cell priming following infection with neuroattenuated MHV significantly reduced spinal cord demyelination and inflammation, as well as improving motor coordination deficits. Strikingly, transferred Treg did not compromise viral clearance or alter the percentage of virus-specific cells in the CNS of infected mice, showing a beneficial role of Treg also at a time when CNS infection has already been established. Transfer of Treg concomitant with MHV-specific T cells to infected recombination-activating gene (RAG)-deficient mice suggested that Treg reduce the migration of pathogenic CD4 + T cells to the brain by inhibiting the antigen presenting capacity of dendritic cells and pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression in the CNS-draining lymph nodes in MHV-infected mice [158, 159] . In addition, Treg have been shown to inhibit the migration of myelin-specific T cells to the brain. The reduced CNS homing might be caused by Treg-mediated downregulation of CXCR3 expression on activated T cells in secondary lymphoid organs. The results indicated that Treg mainly attenuate autoreactive T cells during acute MHV infection but leave protective antiviral immunity intact [155] .",

Hence, Foxp3-ablation during the chronic phase does not affect inflammation, virus load, and autoimmune demyelination in the CNS. The disease phase-dependent effects of Treg-depletion with T cell retention in lymph nodes may be attributed to reduced effector T cell trafficking probably due to restored blood-brain barrier permeability in chronic infection. As observed in IL-27 receptor-deficient mice, IL-10-producing Tr1 cells infiltrated the CNS during chronic MHV infection and were critical for preventing autoimmunity and myelin loss at the site of persistent infection [160] . Table 4 . Effects of regulatory T cell manipulation on viral load and disease severity in acute and chronic infection with neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus. In summary, detrimental effects of Treg on antiviral immunity depend on the genetic background of the animal, timing of manipulation, and the integrity of cytotoxic responses ( Table 3 ). The mechanisms, by which Treg exert their suppressive function in early TMEV-infection of SJL mice, remain uncertain. One of the most potent effectors secreted by Treg is IL-10, and elevated levels of the cytokine have been detected in brains of acutely infected SJL mice compared to lower levels in C57BL/6 mice [145] . In TMEV-infected SJL mice treated with antibodies blocking the IL-10 receptor, no positive effect on viral load in the brain or the spinal cord was observed during acute or chronic infection [152, 153] . However, IL-10 blockade resulted in increased hippocampal damage during acute infection, which is usually only minimal or absent in SJL mice [152] .

In TMEV-infected SJL mice treated with antibodies blocking the IL-10 receptor, no positive effect on viral load in the brain or the spinal cord was observed during acute or chronic infection [152, 153] . However, IL-10 blockade resulted in increased hippocampal damage during acute infection, which is usually only minimal or absent in SJL mice [152] . Thus, IL-10 secretion apparently represents a neuroprotective mechanism in acute TMEV-infection, whereas the suppressive effect on antiviral immunity is most likely mediated by other Treg effector functions.",

Similarly, transplantation of embryoid body-derived NPC transiently increased Treg numbers in CNS-draining lymph nodes, which correlated with remyelination and reduced neuroinflammation in MHV-infected mice [162] . Treg seem to be critical for white matter regeneration in MHV infection because antibody-mediated Treg-depletion increases myelin loss in transplanted mice. Co-culture experiments revealed that NPC increased Treg proliferation and induced conventional T cells to differentiate toward a Treg phenotype in vitro [161, 162] .",

Moreover, the results are fairly consistent, regardless of the used model, virus strains, or method of Treg manipulation. However, adverse effects on viral load have been observed in the TMEV model. Here, a suppression of antiviral immunity occurred in the acute disease phase, characterized by high virus replication, whereas no effects are observed in chronic, low-level viral replication. Moreover, the effects were only observed in animals of a certain genetic background, which are highly prone to virus persistence by nature. TMEV infection has been performed in inbred mice with other genetic backgrounds (e.g., Balb/c, C3H, DBA/1, 129), and also recently in collaborative cross mice, resulting in a broad range of disease phenotypes and susceptibility to virus persistence [143, 163] . However, the studies did not investigate the impact of Treg manipulation on infection outcome. In the coronavirus model, Treg manipulation did not affect virus control in the CNS. Nevertheless, all experiments have been performed in animals of the same C57BL/6 background and negative effects of Treg on MHV replication and persistence could occur in other mouse strains.",

Interestingly, findings in both models indicated that the impact of Treg enhancement or depletion is highly dependent on the timing of the intervention. Although excessive Treg functions interfere with virus elimination and local containment in very early phases of infection, Treg appear to have negligible effects on virus control at later stages in these models. A similar situation is suspected in flaviviral encephalitis, as elevated Treg responses pre-infection correlate with virus spread and neuroinvasion, whereas high Treg numbers post-infection protect mice from fatal encephalitis.",

Treg-mediated neuroprotective effects have been demonstrated in mouse models of retro-, herpes-, and flaviviral encephalitis. Treg-enhancing strategies further showed clear beneficial effects in viral models of chronic demyelinating diseases. Interestingly, in many cases of persistent CNS infections with low-level virus replication, elevated Treg levels did not seem to negatively influence viral burdens, suggesting that Treg somehow are able to modulate detrimental inflammation while ensuring sufficient virus control. The mode by which Treg can differentiate harmful and protective immune reactions remains enigmatic. It has been recently proposed that epigenetic instability of the Foxp3 locus could be a mechanism by which Treg differentiate between self-and non-self-antigens. According to this theory, Treg equipped with high affinity T cell receptors (TCR) for foreign antigens possibly occur due to the lack of negative selection in the thymus. Upon encounter of these antigens in infection, the strong TCR signal combined with the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines at the infection site could destabilize Foxp3 expression, rendering Treg powerless or even converting them to effector T cells. Whether this phenomenon indeed occurs in vivo is still subject of debate because of contradicting results obtained in different fate-mapping experiments [164] .",

The majority of animal experiments in the field of infectious diseases are conducted in standard inbred mouse strains with well-characterized genetic and phenotypic traits, resulting in predictable and reproducible results. However, these experiments do not allow for a generalization of statements regarding the safety of immunomodulation because they are not transferable to a population level. The development of collaborative cross (CC) mice facilitates the extension of infection models to a broader genetic background while maintaining reproducibility. It would be interesting to see how Treg manipulation influences disease outcomes in distinct CC strains. However, specific targeting of Treg is currently only feasible in Foxp3 DTR transgenic mice, which are only available on inbred backgrounds.",

In other experiments, the origin of Treg present in the infected CNS has not been investigated. Recently, distinct resident Treg populations have been described in various tissues, including the CNS.
