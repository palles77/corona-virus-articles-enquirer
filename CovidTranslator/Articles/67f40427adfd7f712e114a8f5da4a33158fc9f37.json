Translocation requires a signal sequence on the nascent polypeptide chain and specific receptors, the signal recognition particle (SRP) and the docking protein (DP) or SRP receptor (1, 2, 6, 18, 19, 32, 33, 38, [46] [47] [48] [49] . SRP has been shown to interact with polysomes holding nascent preprolactin chains, and it has been proposed that SRP binds to the signal sequence (46) . When probed in a wheat germ cell free system with prolactin or IgG light chain mRNAs, SRP arrests the peptide elongation after 70-80 amino acids have been polymerized (33, 47, 48) . Elongation proceeds after SRP has bound to the DP, which is located in the ER membranes (18, 19, 33) .",

In such a system membrane proteins become inserted into the membrane asymmetrically in the same way as in the cell and the orientation across the membrane can be determined by protease treatment (24, 37) . Protease will cleave only that part of a membrane protein that is exposed on the cytoplasmic side, whereas the lumenally disposed part is protected by the membrane. The orientation of the protein across the membrane can then be deduced, if the means exist for detecting the COOH or NH2 termini of the protein. Since we could make use of a monoclonal antibody specific for Ii chain, we tested whether the antibody recognizes exclusively either the lumenally or the cytoplasmically disposed portion of Ii chain. Depending on the location of the antigenic determinant of In-1 we would be able to discriminate between the two possible orientations of Ii chain across the membrane.",

When translation is performed in the presence of microsomal membranes, a 3 l-kD protein is synthesized and this has the same molecular weight as the authentic Ii chain synthesized in vivo (Fig. 1, lane 2) . The latter form is glycosylated, whereas the former is not (see below). Both forms have been described previously (40) . Due to the binding to protein A or Con A, the heavy chains of IgG are also precipitated (Fig. 1, lanes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 ). IgG is a typical secretory protein that is translocated across microspinal membranes and therefore can be used to assess the intactness of the microsomal membranes. After digestion with proteinase K no Ii chain-related protein can be precipitated with In-1 antibody (Fig. 1, lane 3) . Heavy chain of IgG, Figure 1 . Protease digestion of Ii chain from intact and detergentsolubilized microsomal vesicles, mRNA from mouse spleen cells was translated in a wheat germ cell free system in the absence (lane 1) or presence of dog pancreas microsomal membranes (lanes 2-7). After translation, proteinase K, 0.5 mg/ml final concentration (lanes 3 and 6), or proteinase K and 0.5% Triton X-100 (lanes 4 and 7) were added and the mixture incubated for 15 min at 30\u00b0C.

Fig. 1, lane 6 shows that this is indeed the case and that proteinase K treatment of microsomal vesicles reduces the size of Ii chain by ~3 kD. This reduction in size indicates that mouse Ii chain, as its human counterpart, spans the membrane and exposes ~30 amino acid residues on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.

The amount of label in fragments A, B, and C was then determined by densitometry of the autoradiograph (Fig.  3) . It can be predicted that label in a polypeptide fragment located close to the NH2-terminal end will remain constant, whereas label in fragments located close to the COOH-terminal end will increase with time of the pulse. As can be seen in Fig. 3 , the label in fragment C remains constant while label in fragments A and B increases with the length of the pulse. This clearly demonstrates that fragment C is located close to the NH2-terminal end of Ii chain. To demonstrate that the C fragment from in vivo synthesized Ii chain is also recognized by In-1 antibody, we characterized Ii chain and its fragments by immunoblotting with In-1 antibody. Total protein from CH 1.1. cells either before or after digestion with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease was separated by SDS PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose filter, and developed with In-I antibody. Fig. 4 shows that Ii chain and the 41-kD protein are recognized by In-1 antibody (lane 1) as well as after V8 protease digestion the 10-kD fragment C (lane 2).

In contrast, proteins that expose the NH2-terminal end on the cytoplasmic side, like the influenza neuraminidase and the rat and human asialoglycoprotein receptor, are synthesized without a cleavable signal sequence (15, 20, 41) . We therefore asked whether Ii chain is also synthesized without a cleavable signal sequence. In glycoproteins, the presence or absence or a cleavable signal sequence can be determined by comparing the molecular weight of the translation products synthesized in a cell free system in the absence of microsomal membranes with those synthesized in vivo in the presence of tunicamycin. Tunicamycin is known to prevent glycosylation but does not interfere with membrane insertion and cleavage of a signal sequence. As can be seen in Fig. 5 , Ii chain is synthesized in CH 1.1. cells in the presence of tunicamycin as a 25-kD polypeptide chain. The identical molecular weight is found for the Ii chain when it is synthesized in a wheat germ cell free system in the absence of microsomal membranes.",

            "text": "For proteins that are translocated across the membrane of the ER, it is known that SRP and DP are required for their insertion into the membrane (33, 42) . For one membrane protein, which is synthesized without cleavable signal sequence, it has been found that SRP and DP are required for membrane insertion but no arrest in elongation was observed (2) . As demonstrated above, Ii chain is synthesized without a cleavable signal sequence, spans the membrane, and exposes the NH2 terminus on the cytoplasmic side. We tested therefore whether this type of protein requires SRP and DP for membrane insertion and whether elongation could be arrested by SRP. When Ii chain was translated in a wheat germ cell free translation system, the 25-kD unglycosylated form ofli chain was synthesized (Fig. 6, lane 1) . When salt-washed rough microsomes, depleted of SRP, were added, no shift of molecular weight could be detected (Fig. 6, lane 2) . When SRP alone was added to the cell free translation system, synthesis of Ii chain was arrested as well as that of heavy chain of IgG (Fig. 6, lane 3) . The arrest in translation could be released when salt-washed rough microsomes (RMk) were added 15 min after initiation of translation (Fig. 6, lane 4) . Glycosylated Ii chains now accumulated. amino acid residues in the Ii chain. The remaining 170 amino acids are protected by the membrane barrier and must thus be located on the lumenal side of the membrane. (c) The monoclonal antibody In-1 recognizes a determinant located on a part of the Ii chain that is exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Protease digestion of intact microsomal vesicles destroys this binding site. It is the NH2 terminally located fragment C which is recognized by In-l antibody. Two independent methods were used to locate fragment C within Ii chain: (i) After digestion of Ii chain with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, fragment C was found to be the only one that labeled with [3SS]cysteine. The only cysteine in Ii chain occurs 28 amino acid residues away from the NHEterminal end (see Fig. 7 ). (ii) When a gradient of [3SS]cysteine label was introduced into Ii chain, the amount of label in fragment C remained constant throughout the chase period. This is only consistent with a location of fragment C close to NHE-terminal end. (d) There is no cleavable signal sequence found in Ii chain. The unglycosylated precursor of Ii chain synthesized in the wheat germ cell free system in the absence of microsomal membranes has the identical molecular weight as unglycosylated and membrane-inserted Ii chain synthesized by CHI.1 cells. Cleavable signal sequences have a length between 13 and 45 amino acid residues (45) . A difference of five amino acids would have been detected by the SDS PAGE system used.",

            "text": "What mechanism can be envisaged for a common step in membrane insertion of secretory and type 1 and 2 membrane proteins? A very attractive possibility, first proposed by Inouye and his colleagues for the lipoprotein of Escherichia coli and further extended to membrane-spanning proteins, is that the insertion of the NH2-terminal portion of nascent secretory or membrane-spanning proteins into the membrane of the ER occurs in a loop-like fashion (14, 22, 45) . This model is based on the assumption that the NHE-terminal end of the signal sequence, cleavable or noncleavable, remains exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. Cleavage of the signal sequence then releases the new NH2-terminal end of the mature protein to the lumen of the ER vesicle. The cleaved signal sequence might remain in some or all cases buried in the membrane. Type l membrane-spanning proteins, like the H-2 antigens or VSV G protein, have in addition to a cleavable signal sequence a second stretch of uncharged amino acid residues located close to the COOH-terminal end. This functions as a \"stop transfer\" sequence and anchors the protein in the membrane. In type 2 membrane proteins with uncleaved signal sequence the single hydrophobic segment might perform two functions: (a) as a single sequence mediating SRPdependent membrane insertion, and (b) as a stop transfer sequence anchoring the protein in the membrane. Certainly further direct evidence is required for support of this model for membrane insertion of type 2 membrane proteins.",
