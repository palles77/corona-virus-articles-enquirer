The importance of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) as the aetiological agent has increased, especially in children aged 5 years or older. 2 Although several clinical rules have been proposed, there are no signs or symptoms with a good enough predictive value for the aetiological diagnosis of pneumonia. 3 The introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of MP has led to a breakthrough in its management, as it offers quick results with a high sensitivity and specificity that can guide treatment. 4 The aim of our study was to describe the epidemiology, clinical manifestations and treatment of communityacquired MP pneumonia (CAMP) in a paediatric population over a period of 6 years.",

Outbreaks may be facilitated by the waning of herd immunity and shifts in the MP serotypes circulating in the human population. 4 The seasonal prevalence differs depending on the population under study. In countries with temperate climates, outbreaks of MP infection tend to occur in the summer or early autumn, when other respiratory infectious pathogens are less prevalent. 9 In our sample, we found a higher proportion of positive cases in summer. However, there were incidence peaks in July, November and December. A higher incidence of respiratory tract infections in November and December combined with a smaller proportion of MP infections could explain the higher number of cases of pneumonia but with a lower positivity rate for MP in these months.",

The development of PCR has been a breakthrough in this regard. The data in our study showed a clear shift from the use of serological methods to the use of PCR for diagnosis. However, some concerns remain unresolved, such as the presence of asymptomatic carriers, previously described in children, which complicates the interpretation of PCR results. 22 We also found a changing trend in the use of clarithromycin, which was displaced by azithromycin in the second period (91.5% vs. 3.1% of azithromycin out of all macrolide prescriptions), a treatment that has a more convenient dosing schedule. In fact, the 2011 United States guidelines recommended azithromycin as the antibiotic of choice. 19 The laboratory characteristics of CAMP were remarkable. We ought to highlight the low elevation of CRP, with levels that were very similar to those reported in other studies. 9, 17, 23 The main concern about treating a child with CAMP with a macrolide in monotherapy is the possibility of co-infection with S. pneumoniae and the drug resistance associated with this pathogen. An article published by Chiu et al. reported higher levels of CRP in cases of MP with S. pneumoniae coinfection compared to MP monoinfection (66.5 \u00b1 24.0 mg/L vs. 296.1 \u00b1 114.3 mg/L; P < .01). 12 In the sample under study, there was only 1 detected case of bacterial coinfection (C. pneumoniae). Other authors have reported proportions of bacterial coinfection of up to 2% in patients with CAMP. 24 This difference could be explained by several reasons: local epidemiology influenced by vaccination coverage, the setting of the sample under study, the kind of samples used for testing or the microbiological criteria used in the case definition.",

This is a common limitation of similar studies. 7---12 However, this allowed us to describe the management of these infections in clinical practice with the tests available for use in the acute phase, and the follow-up and treatment chosen based on the results of these tests. Secondly, the retrospective nature of the study precluded the collection of samples for assessment of other microbial coinfection or for follow-up in all patients. Finally, the lack of routine testing for mutations that confer macrolide resistance prevented us from establishing the rate of drug resistance in our sample. It is well known that there has been a worldwide increase in the circulation of macrolide-resistant MP strains. 28---30 In conclusion, according to this study, among the children with CAP, the proportion of infection by MP is highest in those who are older, have milder symptoms and have lower levels of inflammatory markers, so these subsets could benefit from empiric treatment with a macrolide. Thus, knowledge of the epidemiology in a given geographical area may be important for the management of CAP in children.",
