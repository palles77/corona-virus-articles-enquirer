Fifty-six patients were included; in 16 (28.6%) patients with symptoms of lung disease a BAL sample was collected, 7 (43.7%) patients had a VL 4150 copies/mL (six had probable CMV pneumonia). Patients with CMV pneumonia were female (100%), of median age 53.5 years, and the median time from transplantion to onset of symptoms was 67.5 days. Pneumonia was early in three cases (incidence 5.4%). Median BAL VL was 53 250 copies/mL and plasma VL was 538 copies/mL (in one patient, the plasma VL was negative). Three (50.0%) patients had an improvement in the first week of treatment, and plasma VL became negative; the other 3 (50.0%) patients died with a CMV pneumonia refractory to treatment. Therefore, any value of CMV VL in BAL, especially if it is greater than plasma, with compatible signs or symptoms, should be considered suggestive of CMV pneumonia in recipients of AHSCT and they should receive specific treatment.",

Thirty-five (62.5%) patients had a plasma CMV reactivation in the first 100 days after transplantation. In 16 (28.6%) patients a BAL sample was collected, and the VL of CMV in BAL was positive in 10 patients (in 7 4150 copies/mL and in 3 4150 copies/mL), negative in 2 and in 4 patients with negative virologic culture, the sample were insufficient for VL. Three patients with VL less than 150 copies/mL were diagnosed with idiopathic pneumonia, but they had a good evolution with ganciclovir treatment. Of the 7 patients with BAL VL higher than 150 copies/mL, 6 (85.7%) were diagnosed of probable CMV pneumonia and in 1 (14.3%) case CMV disease was discounted. This patient presented on day +7 post-transplant with respiratory symptoms, bilateral interstitial infiltrate and pleural effusion, and the VL was undetectable in plasma and BAL specimens. On day +21 post transplant, a plasma viremia (o 150 copies/mL) was detected, and ganciclovir treatment was started on day +35 because the patient had a clinical improvement but no radiological improvement; plasma VL was 265 copies/mL and BAL VL was 321 copies/mL. Plasma and BAL VL became undetectable without complete clinical or radiological improvement and died on day +165 post transplant by alveolar hemorrhage associated with bronchiolitis obliterans in the context of a chronic GvHD and tumor progression. Table 1 shows the clinical, epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of the six patients with CMV pneumonia (10.7% of all patients). All patients were female and median age was 53.5 years old (range 18-61). The median time from transplantation to onset of symptoms was 67.5 (range 12-263) days. Pneumonia was presented early in three cases (incidence 5.4%) and late in other three. The median BAL VL was 53 250 (4.7 log) copies/mL (range 670-410 000 000). In five cases plasma VL was positive, with a median of 538 (2.7 log) copies/mL (range o 150-61 800). All patients had a plasma VL less than BAL VL, and in one case plasma VL was negative.

Studies have analyzed the value of VL in BAL in other patient populations, mainly in lung-transplanted patients, in which it is considered that high VL (above 46 000 copies/mL or 500 000 copies/mL) is suggestive of CMV pneumonia. [11] [12] [13] In our study, the patients with probable CMV pneumonia had a wide range (670-410 000 000 copies/mL) of VL and a median above 50 000 copies/mL. However, all patients with a BAL VL less than 1000 copies/mL (including three patients with loads o150 copies/mL) responded to treatment with ganciclovir and had a good CMV viral load in BAL in AHSCT L Iglesias et al evolution, which could be related to an early stage of the disease. Moreover, 75% of patients with VL higher than 50 000 copies/mL, died of refractory pneumonia. The non-response to treatment in patients with high VL could be related to an advanced clinical stage or resistance to ganciclovir. All patients' plasma VL was lower than in BAL; one patient even had an undetectable plasma VL. This fact was described by other authors, 11, 13, 14 which could imply that plasma VL monitoring has limitations to anticipate the development of pneumonia, and therefore low or undetectable viremia levels did not exclude CMV pneumonia. In the only patient with detectable BAL VL, without CMV pneumonia, the BAL VL was not higher than in plasma. In this study, 10.7% of patients who received an AHSCT were diagnosed with probable CMV pneumonia with a high percentage of mortality (50%) with a specific treatment. As described in other studies, 15 the factor associated with increased mortality was the persistent CMV DNAemia for more than 2 weeks in spite of antiviral therapy, which could be related to ganciclovir resistance, although we could not analyze this fact. In two patients who died, the treatment was changed to foscarnet very late (after 20 days of ganciclovir treatment, the plasma VL did not become negative).",

We believe that this study, in spite of the low number of patients, is important because there are no publications in which BAL CMV VL was evaluated in patients with AHSCT. It is noted that conventional diagnosis methods in BAL and the plasma VL are limited and have a low performance. Tests to quantify VL of CMV are available in many clinical microbiology laboratories and this is an advantage because they could be used to quantify the BAL VL samples. These results should not be extrapolated to other populations, such as HIV or solid organ transplant recipients.",
