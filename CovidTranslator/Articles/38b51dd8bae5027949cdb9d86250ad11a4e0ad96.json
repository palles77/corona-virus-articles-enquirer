In turn, the host expresses antiviral restriction factors to defend against infection. To find host cell modifiers of influenza A H1N1 viral infection, we used a functional genomic screen and identified over 120 influenza A virus-dependency factors with roles in endosomal acidification, vesicular trafficking, mitochondrial metabolism, and RNA splicing. We discovered that the interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins IFITM1, 2, and 3 restrict an early step in influenza A viral replication. The IFITM proteins confer basal resistance to influenza A virus but are also inducible by interferons type I and II and are critical for interferon's virustatic actions. Further characterization revealed that the IFITM proteins inhibit the early replication of flaviviruses, including dengue virus and West Nile virus. Collectively this work identifies a family of antiviral restriction factors that mediate cellular innate immunity to at least three major human pathogens.",

Each subgenomic segment is coated by viral nucleoprotein (NP) and bound to a single viral RNAdependent RNA-polymerase holoenzyme (RdRp), composed of PA, PB1, and PB2 subunits. Infection begins with the binding of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein to sialyated host cellsurface glycoproteins (Skehel and Wiley, 1995) . Following endocytosis, viral particles are trafficked through both early and late endosomes, with the acidification of the latter compartment altering the conformation of HA, leading to host-viral membrane fusion, entry of the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) into the cytosol (Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2003) , and nuclear import.",

However, many viruses deploy anti-IFN countermeasures, which for influenza A virus are primarily enacted by the viral protein NS1 (Hale et al., 2008) . To identify host factors that modify viral replication we undertook an siRNA screen. In this screen we identified over 120 host factors required for influenza A replication that identify many central functions and interactions required for the viral life cycle as well as potential antiviral drug targets. Our studies also revealed a family of antiviral factors, the IFITM proteins, that mediate interferon's innate immune role in combating not only all pathogenic influenza A virus strains examined but also West Nile virus and dengue virus.",

After 12 hr the cells were stained for surface expression of HA as an indirect surrogate marker for viral infection ( Figure 1A ). Although measuring viral protein levels is an indirect measurement of viral replication, in three previous viral screens where we measured HIV, West Nile virus, and HCV replication by immunofluorescence and by titering, the viral protein reduction strongly correlated with reduction in viral titers. Thus we feel that this indirect assay can provide an accurate measurement of viral impairment. This approach detects viral-host receptor binding, endocytosis and fusion of the virion, vRNP trafficking and nuclear import, the transcription, nuclear export, and translation of the viral HA mRNA, and the trafficking of HA to the surface. The screen The results of the screen are shown with the siRNA SMARTpools ranked in order of average Z score, from lowest (decreased infection) to highest (increased infection). The position of known influenza A virus-host factors and several newly identified genes from the screen are indicated. (D-F) U2OS cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs for 72 hr, then infected with PR8. Twelve hours after infection the cells were analyzed by IF for the following viral proteins, HA (surface or entire cell), NP, and M2. Relative fold infection is normalized to nontargeting (C) control. Values represent the mean \u00b1 SD, n = 4. (G-I) Western blots for cells in (D)-(F). C, nontargeting siRNA negative control.

We employed bioinformatics to identify networks and enriched gene sets within this gene set (Dataset S1C). Ninety-two gene ontology (GO) biological process terms, assigned to 109 genes, were significantly enriched (Dataset S2). Of these, 17 are nonredundant and assigned to less than 500 genes, suggesting that they are informative and specific.

Eight out of eleven distinct siRNAs targeting IFITM3 increased infection, with the levels of knockdown correlating with the phenotype (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A; Dataset S1B). Increased influenza A virus infection was also observed in primary lung fibroblasts after IFITM3 depletion ( Figure S3B ) and in HeLa cells (Figures S3C and S3E) , with newly budded virus from HeLa cells increased >5 fold in titering assays ( Figure S3D ). Lowering IFITM3 levels similarly increased infection by the influenza A H1N1 viral strain WS/ 33 ( Figure 3I ) but had no effect on HIV infection ( Figure S3F ). Stable expression of a C-terminal HA-tagged protein, IFITM3-HA 6R , lacking the 3 0 -untranslated region targeted by siRNA IFITM3-6 rescued resistance to the virus ( Figures 3D and 3E ).

In addition, the overexpression of IFITM3 in a canine cell line used for propagating influenza A viruses (Madin-Darby canine kidney [MDCK] cells) strongly inhibited the cytophathic effect of sequential rounds of viral infection ( Figures 4G and 4H ) and also blocked infection by two current seasonal vaccine strains, A/Brisbane/59/07 H1N1 and A/Uruguay/716/07 H3N2, and by A/Aichi/2/68 H3N2, a viral isolate from the Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 ( Figure S4D ).

            "text": "Human and murine IFITM proteins display a high degree of interspecies homology ( Figure S6 ). Thus, to examine the evolutionary conservation of IFITM protein function, we derived murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from a mouse strain, IfitmDel, deleted for all of the Ifitm genes (Ifitm1, 2, 3, 5, and 6; Lange et al., 2008) . In spite of the loss of these genes, the IfitmDel mice develop normally (Lange et al., 2008) . Comparison of IfitmDel +/+ , +/\u00c0, and \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs revealed a marked increase in PR8 infection in the \u00c0/\u00c0 cells ( Figure 5A ). The differences in infection were more pronounced when the MEFs were cultured with IFN-a or -g prior to viral infection ( Figures 5A-5C ). As in human cells, we observed a vesicular staining pattern for Ifitm3 ( Figures 5D and 3C ). Forced expression of Ifitm2 or 3 in the IfitmDel \u00c0/\u00c0 cells restored resistance to influenza A H1N1 infection ( Figures 5E and 5F ). We conclude that the Ifitm protein family accounts for a significant proportion of the anti-influenza actions of types I and II IFNs in mice, and the majority of this function can be restored by the stable expression of Ifitm2 or 3. VLPs expressed the envelope proteins of one of three flaviviruses, West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), or the Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OMSK). These VLPs can undergo a single round of infection and are produced by transiently expressing the respective envelope proteins together with the WNV structural genes in cells stably expressing subgenomic WNV replicons containing EGFP (Yoshii and Holbrook, 2009 ). As observed with influenza A pseudoparticles, all three VLPs were blocked by each of the IFITM proteins, demonstrating that these restriction factors impede first round infection ( Figure 6A ). Again, the IFITM proteins were found to inhibit VSV-G-mediated infection to a lesser extent ( Figure 6A ). In contrast, pseudoparticles expressing the envelope proteins of three arenaviruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Lassa virus (LASV), and MACH, or the MLV retrovirus, were not affected by IFITM expression. We next tested the effects of IFITM protein levels on two pathogenic flaviviruses, WNV and DNV. The replication of the 2741 strain of WNV was dramatically decreased in either A549 or U2OS cells stably overexpressing IFITM3 (Figures 6B and 6C) . Furthermore, siRNA depletion of IFITM3 protein also led to an increase in replication of both WNV (Figures 6D and 6E ) and DNV serotype 2 (New Guinea C strain, Figures 6F and 6G) . However, although IFITM3 did not inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV), a more distantly related member of the Flaviviridae family, it did block influenza A virus infection in the same HCV-permissive liver cell line (Huh 7.5.1, Figures  S5D and S5E ). We conclude that IFITM proteins restrict the replication of two additional human pathogens, DNV and WNV, and are likely to also limit YFV and OMSK infection based on the VLP data.",

IFITM proteins were originally described 25 years ago based on their expression after IFN treatment (Friedman et al., 1984). The human IFITM1, 2, 3, and 5 genes lie adjacently on chromosome 11. IFITM1, 2, and 3 are nearly ubiquitously expressed whereas IFITM5 is expressed in osteoblasts. The IFITM proteins have been ascribed roles in immune cell signaling, cell adhesion, oncogenesis, germ cell homing and maturation, and bone mineralization (Evans et al., 1993; Imai and Yoshie, 1993; Lange et al., 2003; Smith et al., 2006) . However, with the exception of IFITM5 0 s role in bone mineralization, we know of no other functional studies clearly demonstrating an additional function for an IFITM family member (Moffatt et al., 2008) . Indeed, in our hands, transformed and primary cells either overexpressing or depleted for IFITM3 display no growth perturbations, and as noted, the IfitmDel mice develop and age normally (Lange et al., 2008) . The IFITM proteins belong to a protein domain superfamily consisting of over 30 proteins, each possessing two transmembrane domains and an intervening highly conserved intracellular loop (pfam04505, CD225, Interferon-induced transmembrane protein). Expression of members of the CD225 protein family have been reported in zebrafish, Xenopus, invertebrates, and bacteria, and homologs are found in frog, fish, fowl, and mammals (mouse, rat, dog, swine, cow, primate, and human; Figures S6 and S7 ). Now that an antiviral role has been demonstrated, it will be interesting to determine if any of the related factors participate in host-pathogen interactions and, if so, how early in evolution this protein domain became associated with innate immunity.",

Furthermore, the IFITM proteins inhibit two highly pathogenic flaviviruses, WNV and DNV, and likely control YFV and OMSK, indicating a very general antiviral role. Previous work suggested that overexpression of human IFITM1 in murine fibroblasts partially blocked infection by VSV but not by influenza A virus, although no loss-of-function experiments were reported (Alber and Staeheli, 1996) . We also detected modest inhibition of VSV-G pseudoviruses but very strong inhibition of influenza A virus with all three IFITM proteins.

Consistent with this notion, we observed that depletion of IFITM3 resulted in loss of 40% to 70% of IFN's protective effect, with a similar diminution also detected in the IfitmDel mouse cells. Thus, IFITM proteins are critical for the innate immunity to influenza A virus afforded by IFNs. These results contribute to our understanding of IFN action in that they demonstrate that these antiviral cytokines block viral entry by inducing the expression of the IFITM proteins.",

Logic would further predict that IFITM proteins could target a common step in the viral life cycle. While influenza A virus and flaviviruses bind distinct receptors, both are endocytosed through a clathrin-dependent pathway, although influenza A also has a clathrin-independent pathway (Chen and Zhuang, 2008; Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2002) . After endocytosis, early endosomes containing influenza A virus fuse with late endosomes where a pH < 5.5 triggers the HA-directed fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, permitting vRNP entry (Figure 7 ; Lamb and Krug, 2001) . In contrast, flaviviruses undergo fusion in early endosomal compartments and at a considerably higher pH of 6.5 (Krishnan et al., 2007; Sanchez-San Martin et al., 2009 ). Thus, a very general overlap involving clathrin-mediated endocytosis and trafficking into early endosomes exists between influenza A virus and flaviviruses.",

However, we cannot rule out that these resistant viruses may have multiple entry or endosome escape pathways or may have evolved to circumvent terminal rerouting by IFITMs. We would also note, however, that, coculture of IFITM3 overexpressing cells with parent control cells did not confer protection, suggesting a cell-autonomous mode of action (data not shown).

Variations in the basal and inducible levels of these factors as well as the dependency factors within a population might predict the severity of flu or flaviviral infections among individuals or across species. The discovery of the roles of IFITM proteins in innate immunity has relevance to ongoing and future influenza pandemics. Not only could elucidation of the IFITM restriction mechanism prove important in designing new antiviral therapies, but the proteins themselves could be used in multiple ways to fight influenza A, WNV, and dengue virus. If IFITM proteins work on the plasma membrane, they could possibly be delivered to tissues susceptible to initial infection by liposomal transfer. Transgenic animals such as fowl or swine could be developed that overexpress IFITM proteins to provide resistance to influenza A virus and other pathogens, thereby preventing the spread of these viruses, as well as limiting their ability to recombine with human influenza A strains to produce strains dangerous to human populations. Indeed, by creating animals with multiple transgenic restriction factors, we can confront the virus with a more intractable barrier. Finally, if IFITM proteins are also rate limiting for influenza A virus infection in other organisms such as chickens, whose embryos are employed to passage attenuated viruses for vaccine production, the inhibition of IFITM protein expression could reduce the amount of time it takes to produce vaccine and thereby boost yields. This has been a critical issue confounding vaccine production in the current influenza pandemic. The discovery of the role of IFITM proteins as antiviral agents for multiple devastating pathogenic viruses has given us new insights into innate immunity and has provided us new tools with which to counter viral propagation in the future.",

After 72 hr, the medium was removed and the cells were infected with the Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8, ATCC VR-1469), multiplicity of infection (moi) of $0.2-0.3 in 40 ul complete media. After 12 hr, media were removed, and cells were fixed with 4% formalin and stained with anti-HA antibodies (Hybridoma HA36-4-5.2, Wistar Institute), followed by an Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary at 1:1,000 (A11001, Invitrogen). Cells were imaged on an automated Image Express Micro (IXM) microscope (Molecular Devices) and analyzed using the Metamorph Cell Scoring software program (Molecular Devices Inc.).
