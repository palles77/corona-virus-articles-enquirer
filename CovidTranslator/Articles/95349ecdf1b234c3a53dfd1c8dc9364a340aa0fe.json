            "text": "A striking feature of this study is the variety of amino acid (aa) insertions in the ClpG prepilin that have little or no effect on CS31A fimbria biogenesis. These 'permissive' sites tolerate inserts of 18 or 19 aa and accept sequences of different natures in view of their aa composition, charge and hydrophobicity. The results obtained here are also interesting in light of the high level of aa sequence conservation seen in the SP and N-terminal domains of the ClpG-related subunits. The structure-function relationship of the ClpG SP is discussed. The TGEV-C epitope fused to the N-terminal end of the mature ClpG protein was cell-surface exposed, as observed on immuno-electron microscopy. Therefore, the CS31A fimbria seems to be a potent tool for the presentation of foreign antigenic determinants or the production of heterologous polypeptides in E. coli. INTRODUCTION Polymer CS31A is a plasmid-encoded fibrillar protein associated with animal and human pathogenic isolates of Escherichia coli (Contrepois et al., 1989; Cherifi et al., CS3 I A biogcncsis ( Martin ct al., I99 I ).

Extensive nt sequence homology throughout the accessory protein-encoding genes of CS31 A.

In particular, the normal peptidase recognition sequence is dispensable since major substitutions of rcsiducs across this processing junction were permissive for CS31A fimbria production. Although this is the first time these findings have been reported for an E. coli pilin, similar observations were made with Pseudomonas aeruginosa type-IV pilin leader-peptides mutants (Strom and Lory, 199 1) (2) In agreement with the conclusions of Hemila et al.",
