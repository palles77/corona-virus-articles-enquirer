Structuring the population by the time elapsed since the start of travel, we describe the infectious disease dynamics during transportation as well as in the regions. As a result, we obtain a system of delay differential equations. We define the basic reproduction number R 0 as the spectral radius of a next generation matrix. For multi-regional systems with strongly connected transportation networks, we prove that if R 0 \u2264 1 then the disease will be eradicated from each region, while if R 0 > 1 there is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium, which is endemic in every region. If the transportation network is not strongly connected, then the model analysis shows that numerous endemic patterns can exist by admitting a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium, which may be disease free in some regions while endemic in other regions. We provide a procedure to detect the disease free and the endemic regions according to the network topology and local reproduction numbers. The main ingredients of the mathematical proofs are the inductive applications of the theory of asymptotically autonomous semiflows and cooperative dynamical systems. We visualise stability boundaries of equilibria in a parameter plane to illustrate the influence of the transportation network Y. Nakata (B) \u00b7 G. R\u00f6st",

In reality, animal transportation can take rather long time; and in the case of human travel, for rapidly progressing diseases such as SARS and influenza, even a fraction of a day can be significant. During travel, passengers are in a closed environment with a high-density layout of seating, exposed to low humidity and hypobaric hypoxia (Mangili and Gendreau 2005; Silverman and Gendreau 2009) . Thus, it is more precise to consider the number of infected passengers as a dynamical variable in an environment that is different from residential areas, and then the time needed to complete the travel naturally becomes an important parameter of the model. The pioneering works (Liu et al. 2008; Nakata 2011) formulated submodels for disease transmission dynamics during travel, combining with compartmental models in the regions, but, due to the apparent mathematical difficulties, their analysis is restricted to only two identical regions.",

A network is called strongly connected, if for any ordered pair (i, j) of nodes, there is a directed path (a sequence of directed links) from node i to node j. Otherwise, we say that the network is not strongly connected. For example, having two sets of nodes A and B, where there are no directed links from any node in A to any node in B, but there are directed links for any other ordered pair of nodes, gives a connected, but not strongly connected network.",

            "text": "Many transportation networks are naturally strongly connected (one can go from any region to any other region, possibly via other regions), but there are significant biological reasons to consider not strongly connected networks as well. When an outbreak of an infectious disease is reported, the structure of the transportation network may change from strongly connected to not strongly connected, since individuals likely do not travel to the endemic region, and public health authorities may advise against travelling to high risk regions. Some transportation connections may be shut down in order to implement a disease control policy. The simplest example is the case of two connected regions, when the transportation becomes unidirectional. We explore this case in details in Sect. 6. The displacement network for the transportation of livestock is a typical example of not strongly connected networks, as animals are moved from farms to slaughterhouses (possibly via several intermediate steps, such as assembling centres), but there is no movement of livestock from the slaughterhouses back to the farms. During the transportation, animals are kept in crowded cages, therefore there is an elevated risk of disease transmission. Such livestock transportation network can be very complex . Migration routes in ecology typically follow a directional trend, such as from South to North because of climate change, downstream in rivers, etc. In those cases the network of the habitats of the species is not strongly connected. Human networks are usually strongly connected. The rural-tourban migration, however, can be seen as an example for unidirectional transportation if we neglect the short-term mobility such as tourism and business travels. The vector of Chagas disease appeared this way in major cities in South America (Alirol et al. 2011) . The presence of tuberculosis in Canada ) is driven by the constant flow of immigration from developing countries. TB is one of the diseases which is transmissible during travel (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 2009a). Even if the reproduction number of TB in Canada is <1, TB can persist in Canada due to the endemicity in the regions which are the source of immigration. Immigration from Canada to those regions is negligible, hence by ignoring short-term travels, this can be viewed as an example of a not strongly connected network.",

The formulation and the detailed mathematical analysis of the model is given in Sects. 2-5 (some detailed calculations are collected in the Appendix), which may be skipped by a mathematically less inclined reader. We provide a rigorously proven and complete characterisation of the asymptotic behaviour of the system for an arbitrary number of regions for any network structure. The main techniques we use are stability theory of delay differential equations, cooperative sublinear systems, and an iterative application of the theory of asymptotically autonomous semiflows. In particular, we show that there always exists a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. In the case of strongly connected transportation network, the basic reproduction number of the full system (defined as the spectral radius of a next generation matrix), as usual, serves as a threshold: either the disease dies out in every region, or the disease persists in every region. However, if the network is not strongly connected, multiple endemic patterns may emerge: some regions may become endemic, while the disease may be eradicated in some other regions. We provide a systematic method to determine, based on the network structure and local reproduction numbers, which regions become endemic and which regions become disease free. The results are illustrated for the case of two patches in Sects. 6-7. In Sect. 8 we numerically investigate the scenario when the dispersal rates of susceptible and infective individuals are different. Finally, we give a biological interpretation to each analytical result in Sect. 9.",

As an example we fix the parameters, except two dispersal rates, as in Table 2 , where \u03b7 > R 1 (0) > R 2 (0) holds. Using the formula (6.4), we plot the basic reproduction number as a function of (\u03b1 21 , \u03b1 12 ) in Fig. 4 . Theorem 7.1 implies that travel restrictions via reducing dispersal rates are not always helpful to decrease the basic reproduction number, thus one should carefully see how dispersal rates affect the basic reproduction number. To understand this we assume that R 1 (0) > R 2 (0), which implies that, in absence of the transportation, individuals in region 1 are exposed to relatively high risk of infection. One can notice that the expected sojourn time of an infected individual in region 1, given as 1/(d 1 + \u03b4 1 + \u03b1 21 ), decreases as increasing \u03b1 21 . Thus infected individuals in region 1 likely start a journey to the safer place, region 2, as \u03b1 21 is increasing. If R 1 (0) \u2265 \u03b7, then the environment inside the transportation is also relatively safe from the infection. Hence the dispersal rate from region 1 to 2 has a positive effect for reducing the basic reproduction number as shown in (i)-(b) and (i)-(c) in Theorem 7.1.

On the other hand, if \u03b1 12 is large, then the expected sojourn time of an infected individual in region 2 becomes short. Thus infected individuals in region 2 are likely to start a journey to the more risky region 1, rather than staying at region 2. Hence increasing \u03b1 21 , the infectious disease is mainly transmitted in the transportation, where the risk of infection is highest among the three different environments [see (7.2)], thus the basic reproduction number increases as well.

The result in Theorem 7.1 implies that the travel restriction can have both negative and positive impact for disease eradication. The authors in Hsieh et al.

For c = 0.001 one can temporarily decrease the basic reproduction number below unity by reducing dispersal rates, but further reduction increases the basic reproduction number. For small c, as \u03b6 increases, \u03b1 12 increases much slower than \u03b1 21 . Thus the basic reproduction number decreases with respect to the dispersal rates, as explained above, by letting infected individuals in region 1 board the transportation to region 2, which is the safer place. By further increasing \u03b6 , infected individuals in region 2 return to region 1 while spreading the disease in the transportation. Thus, by the same mechanism described above, the basic reproduction number increases as \u03be increases. From Theorem 7.1 it is easy to see that if R 1 (0) = R 2 (0) then the basic reproduction number monotonically either decreases or increases with respect to \u03b6 .

In this section we numerically investigate the general situation, where the dispersal rates of susceptible and infective individuals are different. It is reasonable to suppose that \u03b1 S jk \u2265 \u03b1 jk , thus here we assume \u03b1 jk = q\u03b1 S jk , where the parameter q \u2208 [0, 1] represents the relative travel rate of infected individuals. The special case q = 1 means that the disease is so mild that infected individuals travel at the same rate as susceptibles (this case was analysed in the previous sections), while q = 0 means that infected individuals do not travel at all. Generally, we can see from the simulations on a wide range of parameters that our system shows global convergence of solutions. However, the parameter q has an important role not only in determining the values of the steady states, but also in selecting which of the equilibria is globally attractive. We highlighted two interesting situations in Figs. 6 and 7. Figure 6 shows a scenario where the local reproduction numbers are <1, but the disease is sustained in both patches due to travel related infections for q = 1. Reducing q means that infected individuals travel less, hence the number of travel related infections decreases, thus one suspects that for q small enough, the disease will be eradicated, and indeed this is the case [see (b) for q = 0.65].",

Solid curve is I 1 (t), dashed curve is I 2 (t). In this case both local reproduction numbers are <1, and the disease is endemic only if sufficiently many infected individuals travel of infected individuals even with a small rate q > 0 makes the disease endemic in both patches. The dependence of the endemic equilibria on q in the above cases is illustrated in Fig. 8. In (a) , one can observe a critical q * , that is a threshold between disease eradication and persistence. Notice that the endemic equilibria are very sensitive to Fig. 9 Monotone increasing, monotone decreasing, and non-monotone dependence of the endemic equilibrium on q. Parameters are the same as before, except that in a \u03b1 S 21 = 2 \u00d7 \u03b1 S 12 = 0.2, \u03b2 1 = 0.3, \u03b2 2 = 0.1, \u03b2 T = 0.7, and in b \u03b2 1 = 0.25, \u03b2 2 = 0 q when q > q * . In (b), the disease persists on both patches for all q > 0. The role of q is particularly interesting in the case of strong heterogeneity, when the two patches poses very different risk. Then, by means of transportation, infected individuals move to a completely different environment. A particular case is shown in Fig. 9a , where patch one has high prevalence, while patch two is disease free in the absence of infected travellers. One can observe a nonmonotone behaviour with respect to q: for a small travel rate of infected individuals, by transporting them to a safer patch the density of infection is reduced in patch one. However, increasing the number of infected travellers, this effect diminishes, as patch two becomes more risky, and at the same time the increased volume of infected travellers generates more transport related infections, thus the level of endemicity becomes increasing in patch one as well as q is further increased. Figure 9b represents the extreme situation, when there is no transmission at all in patch two (i.e. \u03b2 2 = 0). Then, the density of infection is a monotone decreasing function of q on patch one, while it is increasing in q in patch two.",

We improve the submodel for disease transmission dynamics during transportation, by adding the possibility of recovery during travel, and by allowing different mobility rates for susceptible and infective populations.

See also Vespignani (2007, 2008) , Meloni et al. (2011 ), Poletto et al. (2012 , where the authors use graphs with various degree distributions to capture human mobility patterns during an epidemic. In the present manuscript, the travel matrix A describes the connectivity of regions, and from A one can construct a directed graph, representing the transportation network. Any transportation networks characterised by directed graphs can be classified as either strongly connected or not strongly connected, in other words, the travel matrix A is either an irreducible or a reducible matrix. Here we consider both types of transportation network and then show that the disease dynamics can be characterised by the structure of the transportation network.",

In Theorem 5.4 we also show that our model admits a thresholdtype dynamics: if the basic reproduction number is less than or equal to one then the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, while if the basic reproduction number is >1 then the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Subsequently we analyse the system when the transportation network is not strongly connected. In the literature, qualitative analysis for multi-regional systems without strongly connected transportation network seems to be limited (except Li and Zou 2010; Arino et al. 2006 , where only 2 and 3 patches are considered). In Sect. 5.2, keeping the generality for the number of regions, we consider the disease dynamics in the reducible case. First we show that the whole multi-regional system can be seen as a set of blocks, where regions within each block are strongly connected via the transportation. Then we provide a systematic way to determine the endemic situation in each block, see Proposition 5.10 and the preceding procedure. Proposition 5.10 gives a simple rule: if the block is accessible from other endemic blocks then that block is also endemic, otherwise the basic reproduction number for the particular block determines the endemic situation as stated in Theorem 5.4. Thus, in general, the system admits partially endemic equilibria, where endemic blocks and disease free blocks coexist. We further prove that our model always has an equilibrium that is globally asymptotically stable.",

From this reordering process, the whole multi-regional system will be divided into blocks. By following the procedure in Sect. 5.2 one can determine every possible disease dynamics. Since there may be a source block that spreads the disease to other blocks, one may try to decrease the basic reproduction number of the source block to eradicate the disease.",

If there is no transport-related infection, one always has r 12 r 21 < 1. However, infection during the travel may allow r 12 r 21 to exceed one, from which the basic reproduction number also exceeds one.

Using mathematical models it is reported that travel restriction can delay the outbreak of influenza (Hollingsworth et al. 2006; Epstein et al. 2007 ). Our results suggest that travel restrictions may not be efficient to control the basic reproduction number. Similar results are obtained in different models (Hsieh et al. 2007; Gao and Ruan 2012) . It is also shown that the basic reproduction number does not necessarily decrease as population mobility decreases, see Fig. 5 . Controlling the local infectious process in each region by e.g. reducing contact rates via isolation policy seems to be more efficient to decrease the basic reproduction number than reducing the population mobility. In most real situations, infected individuals are less likely to travel than susceptibles. The impact of this difference on the dynamics is discussed in details in Sect. 8.",

This assumption leads to a model by delay differential equations with periodic coefficients, where it is much harder to draw biological conclusions, due to the difficulties in the qualitative analysis. Stochastic components may also play a role in the infectious process, as during the transportation, only a limited number of individuals are confined into one carrier, even when the total volume of transportation is very large (this holds for human travel as well as animal transportation). Coupling the stochastic process during transportation with time delay to a deterministic system on the patches is also challenging.

Since, for given parameters \u03b1 21 and \u03b1 12 , H is a quadratic function of the third argument \u03bb with a positive coefficient of \u03bb 2 , it holds that sign (R 0 (\u03b1 21 , \u03b1 12 ) \u2212 R 1 (0)) = \u2212sign H (\u03b1 21 , \u03b1 12 , R 1 (0)) = \u2212sign h 1 (\u03b1 12 ) by Lemma 10.6. Since from Lemma 10.7 one obtains the sign of h j , by Lemma 10.5 we get the sign of \u2202 1 R 0 as in the conclusion. Next we consider the sign of \u2202 2 R 0 . If R 1 (0) = R 2 (0) then one can obtain the sign as in the same argument above. Let us assume that R 1 (0) > R 2 (0). For \u03b1 21 \u2208 (0, \u03bd) we have h 2 (\u03b1 21 ) = H (\u03b1 21 , \u03b1 12 , R 2 (0)) < 0 from Lemmas 10.7 and 10.6. This implies that R 2 (0) < R 0 (\u03b1 21 , \u03b1 12 ), thus by Proposition 10.5 we have \u2202 2 R 0 > 0 for (\u03b1 21 , \u03b1 12 ) \u2208 (0, \u03bd) \u00d7 intR + .
