The SNAP-doped polymer films that were subjected to Raman spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies were not coated with any topcoats in order to more easily study the chemical properties of the SNAP-doped CarboSil matrix directly. All films were dried under vacuum for additional 48 h to remove any residual THF before storage at -20 \u00b0C. All SNAP-doped films and SNAP containing solutions were protected from ambient light during preparation. The thickness of the SNAP-doped film layer was ca. 250 \u00b5m and the thickness of the two topcoat layers was ca. 45 \u00b5m, as measured with a Mitutoyo micrometer.",

As both values are within the error of tolerance, it suggests that the derived equation and the fitting model are successful quantitative representations of the doped polymer system. Raman Mapping: Raman mapping characterization in the low wavenumber regions, where SNAP and polymer peaks can be distinguished readily, was conducted on a randomly selected 32 \u00b5m \u00d7 24 \u00b5m rectangular regions of the SNAP-doped CarboSil film cross section, with 1 \u00b5m steps in both the x and y dimensions to create a fine grid. Raman spectra of all steps were compared with the orthorhombic SNAP spectrum using direct classical least squares (DCLS) analysis. 7 In vitro characterization of SNAP-doped CarboSil catheters against microbial biofilm S--7 A drip-flow biofilm reactor system (Biosurface Technologies Corp., Bozeman, MT), which mimics the catheter environment and bacteria growth condition (at air-liquid interface) in vivo 8,9 , was used to test the antibiofilm properties of SNAP/CarboSil catheters against biofilm formed by Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. The catheters were secured in the center of the bottom surface. The biofilm chambers were first inoculated with 10 mL of bacteria culture (diluted with overnight culture, ~1 x 10 6 CFU/mL) for 1 h to allow bacterial cell adhere on the catheter surfaces. Then the biofilm chambers were supplemented with continuous sterile nutrient medium (10% Luria Broth) at the flow rate of 100 mL/h (controlled by a peristaltic pump) for 7 days at 37 \u00b0C. Finally, the catheters were aseptically removed and each catheter was cut into two 1 cm pieces, which was used for plate counting and imaging, respectively. For plate counting, the catheter segment was homogenized (OMNI TH, Omni International, kenesaw, GA) for 30 s in 2 mL of 10 mM sterile PBS (pH 7.4) in order to disintegrate the biofilm to single cell suspension, which was later diluted by 10-fold each time and plated onto LB agar plates. For imaging, the catheter segment was stained with fluorescent dyes by using Live/Dead BacLight Bacterial Vaiability kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 20 min in the dark, exactly per the kit's instructions. Fluorescent images were acquired with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX71, Center Valley, PA) equipped withFluorescence Illumination System (X-Cite 120, EXFO) and filters for SYTO-9",

A total of 3 New Zealand white rabbits (Covance, Battle Creek, MI) were used in this study. All rabbits (2.5-3.5 kg) were initially anesthetized with intramuscular injections of 5 mg/kg xylazine injectable (AnaSed \u00ae Lloyd Laboratories Shenandoah, Iowa) and 30 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride (Hospira, Inc. Lake Forest, IL).Maintenance anesthesia was administered via isoflurane gas inhalation at rate of 1.5-3%S--8 by mechanical ventilation via a tracheotomy and using an A.D.S 2000 Ventilator (Engler Engineering Corp. Hialeah, FL). Peek inspiratory pressure was set to 15 cm of H 2 O) and the ventilator flow rate was 8 L/min. To facilitate the maintenance of blood pressure stability, IV fluids of Lactated Ringer's were given at a rate of 10 mL/kg/h. In order to monitor blood pressure and to collect intermittent blood samples for analysis during the experiment, the rabbit's right carotid artery was cannulated using a 16-gauge IV angiocatheter (Jelco \u00ae , Johnson & Johnson, Cincinnati, OH). The blood pressure and derived heart rate were monitored by a Series 7000 monitor (Marquette Electronics Milwaukee, WI) while the animal body temperature was monitored with a rectal probe and maintained at 40 \u00b0C using a water-jacketed heating blanket. Sample blood gas analysis (arterial blood pH, PCO 2 , PO 2 , total hemoglobin and methemoglobin) was conducted using an ABL 825 blood-gas analyzer and an OSM3 Hemoximeter (Radiometer Copenhagen, DK). Prior to the placement of catheters, the rabbit left and right external jugular veins were isolated. Five cm lengths of the catheters (one SNAP and one control) were inserted into the veins.
