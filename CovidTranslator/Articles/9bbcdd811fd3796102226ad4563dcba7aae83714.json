As with any infection, occupational infections are controlled by controlling the source of infection, its route of transmission and by protecting susceptible persons. Most occupational infections can be prevented if appropriate measures are implemented. Some occupational infections, especially those for which vaccines are available (e.g. hepatitis B), are more amenable to prevention than others (e.g. hepatitis C). Health education and preventive programs in the workplace provide a good system for minimizing the risk of occupational infections.",

This has helped reduce the burden of occupationallyacquired infections in the healthcare community. 3, 4 In the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also provides guidance and regulatory requirements for worker safety in other industries. These systems are not as well developed in some other industries where there is a recognized risk of occupational infections (e.g. in farming).",

For some occupational diseases there is a strong association with occupation and the disease rarely occurs outside work (e.g. mesothelioma, coal miner's pneumoconiosis). However, most infections are common in the general population and it is difficult to establish a causal link with the occupation. In lay terms an infection will be attributed to an occupation if it is more likely than not to be caused by that occupation. In epidemiologic terms this means an attributable fraction (the proportion of the additional risk that can be attributed to the exposure in the exposed population) of 50% or more, which equates to a relative risk of two (a doubling of the background risk caused by exposure).",

In the healthcare workplace, standard precautions are widely promoted for the care of all patients in addition to enhanced measures for specific infections 8 (http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/2007ip/2007isolationprecautions.html)Protecting susceptible workers Appropriate PPE should be provided.
