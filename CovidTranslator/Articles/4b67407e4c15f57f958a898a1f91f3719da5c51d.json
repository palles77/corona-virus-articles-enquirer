In the cathepsin L inhibition assay, the oxocarbazate caused a time-dependent 17-fold drop in IC 50 from 6.9 nM (no preincubation) to 0.4 nM (4-h preincubation). Slowly reversible inhibition was demonstrated in a dilution assay. A transient kinetic analysis using a single-step competitive inhibition model provided rate constants of k on \u03ed 153,000 M \u03ea1 s \u03ea1 and k off \u03ed 4.40 \u03eb 10 \u03ea5 s \u03ea1 (K i \u03ed 0.29 nM).

To trace the intracellular action of the inhibitors with intracellular cathepsin L, the activity-based probe biotin-Lys-C5 alkyl linker-Tyr-Leu-epoxide (DCG-04) was used to label the active site of cysteine proteases in 293T lysates. The reduction in active cathepsin L in inhibitor-treated cells correlated well with the observed potency of inhibitors observed in the virus pseudotype infection assay. Overall, the oxocarbazate CID 23631927 was a subnanomolar, slow-binding, reversible inhibitor of human cathepsin L that blocked SARS-CoV and Ebola pseudotype virus entry in human cells.",

These enzymes were traditionally linked to nonspecific proteolytic activity within lysosomes. More recently, cathepsin L has been implicated in regulatory events relating to cancer, diabetes, immunological responses, degradation of the articular cartilage matrix, and other pathological processes (Chapman et al., 1997; Turk and Guncar, 2003; Maehr et al., 2005; Vasiljeva et al., 2007) , including osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and tumor metastasis (McGrath, 1999; Turk et al., 2001; Potts et al., 2004; Schedel et al., 2004; Palermo and Joyce, 2008) . Inhibitors of cathepsin L block viral entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Ebola virus and impair conversion of Hendra virus glycoprotein into the mature, active form (Chandran et al., 2005; Pager and Dutch, 2005; Simmons et al., 2005) . With respect to the development of antiviral agents, inhibitors of human cathepsin L are not subject to resistance because of rapid mutations of the viral genome. Cathepsin L is therefore an attractive target for drug development.",

Although CID 23631927 revealed potency in blocking both SARS-CoV and Ebola virus pseudotype entry into 293T cells, CID 16725315 was found to have little inhibition for either SARS-CoV entry (IC 50 \u03fe 10 M) or Ebola viral entry (IC 50 \u03fe 10 M) (data not shown). This difference was postulated to be the result of differing cell permeability properties of the compounds, thus motivating the assay of intracellular cathepsin L inhibition exploiting a labeling probe. Inhibition of Intracellular Cathepsin L. Cells were incubated with four different cathepsin L inhibitors at 10 M for 3 h to permit time for each compound to permeate through cell membranes and interact with cathepsin L via inhibition of the active site of the enzyme. The chemical probe DCG-04, an epoxide electrophile with biotin tag (Greenbaum et al., 2002) , labeled the active cathepsin L at the catalytic site. Any intracellular cathepsin L that had been inhibited during the 3-h incubation would thus be unable to bind the probe DCG-04, especially given the slow reversibility of the carbazate inhibitors. In the Western blot (Fig. 5A) , band intensity was quantified with Multi Gauge 3.0 (Fujifilm) and correlated with the active cathepsin L activity remaining in the cell. The cathepsin L band position was verified in Fig. 5B , and protein loading in each lane was checked using \u2424-actin (Fig. 5C ). The quantified results were normalized against lane 1 (cells treated with DMSO only) and presented in Fig. 5D . The oxocarbazate inhibitor (CID 23631927) caused a 38% reduction in the active intracellular cathepsin L level compared with lane 1. The commercially available cysteine protease inhibitor MDL28170 revealed an IC 50 against cathepsin L of 2.5 nM and IC 50 against SARS in the range of 100 nM (Simmons et al., 2005) . This positive control employing MDL28170 in lane 3 led to a 53% reduction of cathepsin L activity compared with lane 1. The thiocarbazate inhibitor (CID 16725315), however, did not affect cathepsin L level in the cell, as illustrated in lane 4, potentially indicating that the poor cellular uptake of this inhibitor in turn correlates with the poor activity in the viral entry assay. As a positive control, the cathepsin L inhibitor III (Calbiochem), a diazomethyl ketone (lane 5), led to a 29% reduction of cathepsin L activity compared with lane 1.",

Given the \u03fe700-fold cathepsin L/B selectivity of the oxocarbazate inhibitor, we suggest that inhibition of cathepsin L alone is sufficient to block Ebola pseudotype virus entry in HEK 293T cells without the need to simultaneously block cathepsin B.",

Compared with CID 16725315, CID 23631927 had substantially higher k on values, resulting in a lower K i . This improved rate of binding between CID 23631927 and cathepsin L may be attributed to the optimized tetrahydroquinoline structure, which has both stronger hydrophobic interactions in the P1\u0408 subsite and a better hydrogen bond network with the receptor enzyme, as observed and predicted in the docked pose for the ligand-enzyme complex . It is noteworthy that the oxocarbazate and thiocarbazate inhibitors are likely to be covalent reversible inhibitors, because replacement of the thiocarbazate sulfur in CID 16725315 results in a loss of activity (Myers et al., 2008a) . It is quite possible that the mechanism of inhibition involves a tetrahydral intermediate by attack of the active site Cys25 residue on the thiocarbazate carbonyl or oxocarbazate carbonyl. Because it is difficult to predict temperature dependence of the IC 50 , we directly ",

In the present study, cathepsin L inhibitor CID 23631927 was demonstrated to be effective in blocking virus entry in both SARS and Ebola pseudotype infection.

This structural modification improved ligand-protein interaction in the S1\u0408 pocket as demonstrated in molecular docking studies . In addition, we hypothesize that entropic considerations contributed to increased potency. Using the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) property prediction software Qikprop 3.1 (Schrodinger LLC, New York, NY), we found CID 23631927 to have a predicted log value for the partition coefficient cLogP (octanol/water) of 5.296. This cLogP is higher than that of CID 16725315 (4.724). This estimate of cLogP is based on the condition that the inhibitor is uncharged, a condition that is likely to be upheld because the pK a \u03ed \u03ea3.6 (Hur and Guven, 2002) for the indole group of the oxocarbazate and thiocarbazate inhibitors. The predicted increase in hydrophobicity may result in higher permeability of CID 23631927 into cells, hence resulting in better potency in both the virus infection assay (Fig. 4) and intracellular inhibition of cathepsin L (Fig. 5) . The poor activity of the thiocarbazate in the cell-based viral entry assay may be partially explained by the labeling assay in which thiocarbazate treatment had little effect in blocking intracellular cathepsin L activity. The t-benzyloxycarbonyl group on the inhibitors is a common amino protecting group; we have found that this group prevents self-cleavage of the thiocarbazate (Myers et al., 2008b) . We note that this protecting group may be unstable under acidic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract and the oral availability of the compound, with or without the t-benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group, is unknown.",
