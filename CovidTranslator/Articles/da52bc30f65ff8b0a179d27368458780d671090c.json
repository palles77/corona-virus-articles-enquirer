Data were collected from a longitudinal sample of Costa Ricans (N T1/T2 = 449/97). Results revealed that males and females presented a different social cognitive pattern in reaction to A (H1N1) pandemic. In females, the effects of risk perception/self-efficacy on handwashing behaviors were fully mediated by handwashing intentions. In males, self-efficacy influenced both directly and indirectly on handwashing behaviors, and risk perceptions showed no significant effect on handwashing behaviors. These results suggest that gender oriented protocols should be adopted by public health authorities in order to educate males and females in preventing both A (H1N1) and seasonal influenza.",

The unexpected increase in the new infection was identified by health authorities at the beginning of April 2009 as a new type of influenza: A (H1N1). The general population was alerted by the mass media about the emergence of a new \"swine flu\" that mortally affected human beings. In the middle of April 2009, Canada and the United States of America (USA) first confirmed positive cases of A (H1N1) influenza. Costa Rica was the second country in Latin America reporting a positive case of A (H1N1). In reaction to global threats of the new influenza, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 11th of June of 2009, a pandemic phase six. One month later, more than 160 countries around the globe have reported more than 170,000 cases of A (H1N1) influenza with over 1,400 mortal cases. In response, local health authorities and mass media published recommendations on clinical management and public health measures. However, the civil population and authorities remained uncertain on the number of vaccine doses necessary to get a satisfactory immune response, as well as the effectiveness of antiviral medication (WHO, 2009) .",

Reuter and Renner evaluated three different longitudinal models at three different times (Time 1, T1 = October 2009, Time 2, T2 = December 2009, Time 3, T3 = 1-2 days after T2): The first model predicted the hand sanitary pick-up rate on T3, predictors were cognitive/affective risk perceptions gathered at T2. For the second model, cognitive risk perception on T1 was defined as the predictor of affective risk perception at T2, which in return was defined as the predictor of hand sanitary pick-up rates measured at T3. The third model also predicted the pick-up rate measured at T3, examining whether T1-T2 changes in cognitive risk perceptions were related to T1-T2 changes in affective risk perceptions, and whether former changes predicted hand sanitary pick-up rates measured on T3.",

As for Model 2 and Model 3, results revealed that negative affect-related risk perception at T2 mediated the effects of likelihood, severity and likelihood*severity on hand sanitary pick-up rate at T3.

The current study is the first documented investigation that evaluates selected HAPA-Model assumptions in the context of protective handwashing behaviors during the A (H1N1) pandemic influenza in Spanish speaking populations. Figure 1 represents causal relations susceptible of empirical analyses by means of structural equation modeling. Specifically, the HAPA-Model postulates that self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and threats/risks (as function of severity and vulnerability) are the most important predictors of volitional processes (action plans and action control) through the influence on intentions. There are two ways of exploring HAPA-Model relations. One is the stage model approach and the other is the continuum model approach. The first emphasizes on the qualitative stages of behavior change, just as the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (DiClemente & Prochaska, 1982) does, whereas the second stresses the likelihood of behavior change as the Health-Protective-Behavior Model (Weinstein, 2007) does. The HAPA-Model integrates both visions into a unique model which distinguishes between (a) preintentional motivation processes that lead to a behavioral intention, and (b) postintentional volition processes that lead to the actual health behavior (Schwarzer, 2008) .",

Educational level was not considered as a predictor because the sample size was insufficient for the group of less formal education. Results of the first set of ANOVA revealed a significant effect of sex on T1 intentions (F [1,294] = 6.240, p < .01) and T1 behavior (F [1,359] = 8.790, p < .01). In both cases, females presented significantly higher scores as compared to males. Moreover, in the second ANOVA was found that age had a significant effect on T1 intentions (F [1,294] = 7.797, p < .05) and T1 behavior (F [1,359] = 5.659, p < .05). Here, older participants reported higher frequency in the use of handwashing behaviors as compared with younger participants. Results are consistent with literature and confirmed our expectations only for T1. Table 2 shows the Product-Moment Correlations (pairwise solutions) between T1/T2 predictors (risk perception, self-efficacy) and T1/T2 criterion variables (intentions, behaviors). At T1 and T2, self-efficacy was positively correlated with intentions and behavior (p < .05, p < .01, respectively). A similar type of positive correlations emerged from analyses between T1/T2 intentions and T1/T2 behaviors (p < .01). Results are consistent with literature and confirmed our expectations for T1 and T2. Correlations were moderated too low and consistent with theoretical assumptions. ",

However, this result should be evaluated in terms of whether, effectively, GAMMA-Matrix effects are invariant or not across sexes (females, males). To accomplish this task, a three step approach was implemented: First, calculating model fit using the multigroup LISREL option (NG = 2) with no across-group constrain. The unrestricted multigroup model yielded the following GLOBAL fit index statistics: X 2 (231) = 322.8, p = .00; X 2 /df = 1.40; NFI = 1.00; CFI = 1.00; RMSEA = 0.05, 90% CI for RMSEA (0.039; 0.667); Model AIC = 544.8, Saturated AIC = 684. Second, calculating model fit using the multigroup LISREL option (NG = 2) and declaring the GAMMA-Matrix to be equal across both groups with the LISREL command EQ for GA. The resulting GLOBAL fit index statistics for the restricted model were: X 2 (235) = 686.37, p = .00; X 2 /df = 2.88; NFI = 1.00; CFI = 1.00; RMSEA = 0.12, 90% CI for RMSEA (0.11; 0.13); Model AIC = 900.37, Saturated AIC = 684.",

In accordance to recommendations of 1996), these results indicate that an interaction effect is present, because the distance between the X 2 of the constrained (EQ GA) and the X 2 of the unconstrained solution is statistically significant. Furthermore, there was an increase in the size of RMSEA and also in the Model AIC. Therefore, LISREL approach on interaction effect suggests that sex moderates the effects of GAMMA-matrix.

On the one hand, analysis of change and the introduction of similar constructs (e.g., T1/T2 behaviors) that are highly correlated (r T1-T2 > = .50), and on the other, the use of listwise samples that are smaller in size. Bentler (1990) analyzed the performance of several fit indices at several sample sizes and found that, in the case of small samples a CFI = 1.00 can be considered a reasonable indicator for samples of n = 50. There is a debate on whether one should discard a model when some fit indexes do not converge, for example CFI > .95 and RMSEA > .08 (see Jaccard & Wan, 1996) . Kenny (2011) adds to the discussion the problem of accomplishing the ratio sample size versus free parameters. Some authors suggest a ratio of 20:1 (Tanaka, 1987) , whereas others propose 5:1 (Bentler & Chou, 1987) .

            "text": "In considering research questions that are generated by this work, and desirable lines for future research, several specific issues that can be assumed as relevant were recognized: First, the question of whether Model 1, Model 2, Model 3 and Model 4 fit well with german data. Second, and derived from the first point, the question of whether german females and males are different or not in terms of patterns of causal relations between social-cognitive predictors and handwashing intentions/behaviors. Third, the question of cross-cultural invariance/universality of causal relationships remains open. Fourth, the question of whether proximal predictors, such handwashing planning/coping planning at T1 do predict handwashing behaviors at T2. This question has to be evaluated considering HAPA-model assumptions. In sum, more collaborative investigation is needed between and across countries to understand the universality and cultural particularities of pandemics such as the A (H1N1) pandemic influenza from a social-cognitive perspective.",
