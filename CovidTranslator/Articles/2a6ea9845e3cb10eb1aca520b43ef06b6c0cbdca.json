Despite this complexity, the HIV-1 Env must retain conserved determinants that mediate CD4 binding. To evaluate how these determinants might provide opportunities for antibody recognition, we created variants of gp120 stabilized in the CD4-bound state, assessed binding of CD4 and of receptor-binding-site antibodies, and determined the structure at 2.3 \u00c5 resolution of the broadly neutralizing antibody b12 in complex with gp120. b12 binds to a conformationally invariant surface that overlaps a distinct subset of the CD4-binding site. This surface is involved in the metastable attachment of CD4, before the gp120 rearrangement required for stable engagement. A site of vulnerability, related to a functional requirement for efficient association with CD4, can therefore be targeted by antibody to neutralize HIV-1.",

Genetic, immunological and structural studies of the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins have revealed extraordinary diversity, manifest in a variety of immunodominant loops, as well as multiple overlapping mechanisms of humoral evasion, including selfmasquerading glycan and conformational masking [8] [9] [10] [11] . These evolutionarily honed barriers of diversity and evasion have confounded traditional vaccine development.",

The gp120 surface bound by b12 was confined largely to the gp120 outer domain, consistent with predictions from alanine substitutions (Supplementary Table 7 and ref. 32 ). We examined this surface for features that might make it amenable to antibody recognition. The outer domain is composed of two barrels, stacked end to end (Fig. 2) . The termini-distal barrel comprises seven anti-parallel \u03b2-strands; the other contains six \u03b2-strands embracing the \u03b12 helix. b12 binds at the barrel-barrel juncture to the gp120 face opposite the \u03b12 helix. Although most of the gp120 backbone is involved in secondary structure interactions, the barrel juncture contains a number of structural elements with unpaired backbone, often used by antibodies in recognition. Principal among these are two parallel loops-the CD4-binding loop and the outer domain exit loop-that extend from the only two parallel \u03b2-strands in the entire gp120 core. b12 takes advantage of this backbone reactivity, forming six direct and four water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the main-chain atoms of these two loops ( Supplementary Fig. 2) .

In primary isolates, which are generally resistant to neutralization by soluble CD4, this interaction is not stable and CD4 readily 'falls off'. However, at the cell surface (or with dodecameric CD4), multiple CD4 molecules can bind simultaneously to the viral spike and use avidity to enhance stability. The avidity-enhanced outer domain-CD4 complex provides a receptive contact surface for the bridging sheet.

There are parallels between several key CD4 contact residues and those of b12. For example, Phe 43 of CD4 (shown in stick model) inserts into a critical juncture at the nexus of the inner, outer and bridging sheet regions of gp120, whereas Tyr 53 of b12 (also shown in stick model) inserts at a similar position, although displaced by ~3 \u00c5.
