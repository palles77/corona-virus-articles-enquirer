Methods: A prospective multicenter, matched, double cohort study was conducted in 27 centers in Europe and Canada. The rates of physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing in premature infants <36 weeks gestation who had received palivizumab in the first year of life were compared to those of gestational age-matched controls. Results: The relative protective effect of palivizumab on physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing through the ages of 2 to 5 years was 68% in those with no family history of asthma (odds ratio, 0.32; (95% CI, 0.14-0.75; N 5 146 palivizumab-treated, 171 untreated) and 80% in those with no family history of atopy or food allergies (odds ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.07-0.59; N 5 101 palivizumab-treated, 100 untreated). In contrast, there was no effect of palivizumab on subsequent recurrent wheezing in the 90 children with a family history of atopy or food allergies compared to 130 untreated infants with atopic families. Conclusion: Respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in nonatopic children decreases by 80% the relative risk of recurrent wheezing but does not have any effect in infants with an atopic family history. This suggests that RSV predisposes to recurrent wheezing in an atopy-independent mechanism. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2010;126:256-62.) ",

[2] [3] [4] [5] It is unclear whether most severe RSV LRTIs occur in predisposed patients with asthma or whether they are causal in subsequent asthma. We have used palivizumab (Synagis, MedImmune, Inc, Gaithersburg, Md; marketed outside the USA by Abbott, Abbott Park, Ill), a humanized mAb against the RSV fusion protein that prevents severe RSV LRTI, in a prospective matched double cohort multicenter study in premature infants to separate these effects. 6 In a multivariate analysis, we demonstrated that by preventing severe RSV LRTI in infancy, later recurrent wheezing was reduced by 58% and physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing by 65% compared to controls. However, a large study conducted in Wisconsin 7 (the Childhood Origins of ASThma [COAST] study.) showed that in children with a strong family history of atopy, rhinovirus was the most important cause of development of children wheezing at 3 7 and 6 years. 8 Finally, a study from Australia showed Abbreviations used LRTI: Lower respiratory tract infection RR: Relative risk RSV: Respiratory syncytial virus that both rhinovirus and RSV interact with atopy in infancy to promote later asthma, suggesting that both of these are required in disease pathogenesis. 9 Other studies from Canada 10 showed that exposure to parainfluenza virus and RSV in the first year of life was associated with possible asthma at 2 years of age.",

Analyses compared the prophylaxed group with the combined untreated groups and the nonhospitalized untreated group. Post hoc subgroups of infants were determined on the basis of whether the following were present at baseline: family history of asthma and family history of atopy (asthma, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis) or food allergies. Family was defined as anyone in the immediate family. Analyses were performed within these subgroups. A sample size of 200 infants per group would provide approximately 80% power for a 2-sided, .05-level test to detect as statistically significant a difference in physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing rates when the true rates were 3% for the prophylaxed group and 10% for the untreated controls.

In both of these subgroups, the untreated infants had greater mean gestational age and birth weight than the palivizumab-treated infants (Tables I and II ). This was expected because guidelines for palivizumab use favor treatment for smaller, more premature infants.

In contrast, in children with a family history of asthma, being a member of a multiple birth and having more siblings in day care significantly increased the risk of physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing, whereas having more siblings in the home decreased the risk.",

            "text": "The results of the COAST Study 7, 8, 12 and the subsequent study from Australia 9 appear to be in contrast to our initial findings that the administration of palivizumab in infancy protects premature subjects against subsequent recurrent wheezing in the first 3 to 4 years of life. 6 This prompted us to examine the potential for a differential effect of RSV prevention in those with and without an atopic diathesis. Our finding of a significant protection in children with no family history of asthma or atopy does suggest that the differences may be explained by an atopic diathesis. Thus, whereas our study was conducted in preterm children, and whereas we recruited almost equivalent numbers of children with an atopic background and a nonatopic background, the COAST Study consisted almost entirely of infants with an atopic background. 7 Because we did not examine the effects of rhinovirus infection in early infancy in children in the atopic group, we could not comment on the relationship between early rhinovirus infection and later subsequent asthma. However, the apparent lack of an effect of prevention of RSV in atopic subjects fits in well with the apparent lack of an independent effect of early life RSV seen in the COAST Study. 7 The relatively low number of children in our study with a family history of asthma may in part explain the nonsignificant reduction in that group. In the group of children with an atopic family history, however, there was almost the same number of children as with no atopic history. The consistency of our findings in all the subgroups on the basis of the absence of family atopy/allergy history and the increasing protection (at least for the point estimates) as successive atopic backgrounds are removed (from a family history of asthma to family history of atopy or food allergies), despite a lower number of children with no family history of atopy or food allergies, suggest that our observation is real. The subjects in this trial were recruited at the mean age of 19 months (range, 1-40 months). It is possible that some of these children already had recurrent wheezing (3 or more episodes of physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing) before that age. When we examined the subgroup of children with no family history of atopy or food allergy with multiple logistic regression, palivizumab treatment reduced the risk of physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing by 80%; this was in contrast with palivizumab not having a significant effect in those with such a history. Children with recurrent wheezing in this group may have had recurrent wheezing for several reasons. A minority would have asthma starting early in life, and some would be those with recurrent wheezing after RSV, occurring before enrollment. These would be few, because our definition was 3 or more episodes of recurrent wheezing (in this case, before enrollment). Because subjects were between 2 and 5 years of age at the completion of the study, this may be too early for hereditary allergic factors to exert their effect on wheezing. However, allergic factors may have exerted an effect, because the influence of palivizumab was less apparent in these subjects. The children within the group with the most protection thus probably had no atopic diathesis and would probably not go on to develop asthma in later life. It is precisely within this group that the maximum protection was seen.",

            "text": "Because none of the patients in the palivizumab group and 33% of the control group were hospitalized with RSV, it is possible that the results reflect the more severe previous RSV disease in the control group. 13 Hence, we compared the outcomes in the treated and control groups that were not hospitalized for RSV. There were still significant differences between the palivizumab-treated and the nonhospitalized untreated group in those subgroups with no family histories of atopy or food allergies. The logistic regression analysis once again showed that the major factor associated with a reduction in physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing was treatment with palivizumab in those without an atopic diathesis. A family history of atopy or asthma may be a risk factor for severe LRTI in early life 14, 15 or RSV hospitalization. 16, 17 In patients with a family history of asthma, the effect of palivizumab appeared to be marginal, suggesting that the atopic or asthmatic background is a severe enough predisposing factor for the development of later occurring wheezing, and perhaps RSV infection does not increase that risk very much. This thesis is supported in part by our observation in the Cox regression model clearly showing that in those with an atopic diathesis or food allergies, the family history of asthma is still the strongest predictor of recurrent wheezing later, and prevention by palivizumab of RSV does not appear to have any significant effect in this population. This study shows a protective effect of 65% in the overall population and 80% in those with no background of atopy or food allergies, and the consistency of the effect appears to be a strong indicator that RSV may lead to recurrent wheezing in this population. Whether this effect persists into later childhood or into adult life is a question that remains to be answered. Studies from Australia seem to suggest that early-life respiratory infections with either RSV or rhinovirus in conjunction with atopic sensitization may contribute to the risk for subsequent development of persistent asthma. 9 At the same time, studies from Tucson 18 predict that children with persistent wheezing at the age of 6 years in conjunction with a family history of asthma predict the onset of later asthma in adulthood. 19 Our study clearly cannot answer questions about the genesis of later childhood asthma or adult-onset asthma, but the observation does lend itself to the intriguing possibility that perhaps preventing RSV infection early in life prevents sensitization and potentially the development of later asthma. This hypothesis was suggested by data from a mouse model of infection and supported by a study of RSV prophylaxis in human beings. In the mouse model of RSV infection, it has been shown that respiratory infections of young mice sensitize the mice to aeroallergens to which they were exposed during infection. 20 However, a more recent study suggests that remodeling after RSV in the mouse model occurs without sensitization. 21 In a previous study using RSV immunoglobulin, 22 it was suggested that the combined immunosuppressive effect of high doses of monthly prophylactic immunoglobulin and the anti-RSV activity of the RSV immunoglobulin given to children with chronic lung disease of prematurity abrogated the development of abnormal lung function at 7 to 9 years of age. Future studies (randomized control trials) of RSV infection using mAbs in children with and without an atopic background are being planned to address the role of RSV in the development of subsequent asthma.",
