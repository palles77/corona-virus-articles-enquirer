The main objective of this study was to determine the existence of a correlation between RSV load and disease severity and also between diVerent clinical markers and mRNA levels of the interferon stimulated gene (ISG)56 in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis. We also evaluated whether viral load tended to be persistent over the course of the RSV infection. The levels of RSV-RNA were quantiWed in nasopharyngeal washings, collected from 132 infants infected with RSV as a single (90.15%) or as a dual infection with other respiratory viruses (9.85%). Results indicated that viral load was positively related to the clinical severity of bronchiolitis, the length of hospital stay, the levels of glycemia and the relative gene expression of ISG56, whereas an inverse correlation was observed with the levels of hemoglobin. We also found that the RSV load signiWcantly decreased between the Wrst and second nasopharingeal washings sample in most subjects. These results suggest that infants with high RSV load on hospital admission are more likely to have both more severe bronchiolitis and a higher airway activation of antiviral immune response.",

            "text": "Bronchiolitis is an acute infection of the respiratory tract and is mainly associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [1] . The clinical spectrum of RSV bronchiolitis in previously healthy infants is extremely variable, ranging from mild upper respiratory symptoms to severe respiratory distress and, occasionally, death [2] . The factors determining severity of RSV-associated bronchiolitis have not been clearly established and are still unknown and are likely to be determined by a combination of host and viral factors. Host-derived risk factors associated with severe bronchiolitis include young age (<6 months), premature birth (<35 weeks of gestation), low birth weight, immunodeWciency or immunosuppression status, and congenital heart or chronic lung disease [2] [3] [4] . In addition single-nucleotide polymorphism in, and expression of, some genes codifying proteins involved especially in the control of innate immune response have been reported as being associated with the RSV disease severity [5] [6] [7] . On the other hand, the inXuence of viral factors such as the RSV-RNA levels on determining the bronchiolitis severity is not fully addressed. To this regard, some studies revealed signiWcant association between disease severity and RSV load in nasopharyngeal secretion of infants with primary respiratory tract infection [8] [9] [10] [11] . In contrast, other failed to found a correlation between bronchiolitis severity and viral load during primary RSV infection [12] [13] [14] .",

In addition, we evaluated the airway innate immune response by measuring the mRNA levels of gene coding for a cytoplasmatic antiviral protein, strongly induced in the lung after interferon (IFN) production or virus challenge [19] , namely the IFN stimulated gene 56 (ISG56). We, then, evaluated whether RSV load variations in bronchiolitis severity were correlated to level of ISG56-mRNA and whether viral load tended to be persistent over the course of the disease.",

In addition we found that coinfection of RSV and other respiratory viruses did not change signiWcantly RSV load although it has been reported that RSV levels were higher in infants with RSV as the primary pathogen that in infants with RSV coinfection [15, 18] . Interestingly, our results demonstrated a positive correlation between RSV load and the clinical score index used for determining the severity of bronchiolitis. In particular, we found that in infants with high levels of RSV-RNA in their NPW, there is a tendency to have more signs of severe respiratory distress. An association between high RSV load and the respiratory disease severity has been reported in previous papers [8] [9] [10] [11] , whereas other studies have failed to detect such an association [12] [13] [14] . Studies that did not Wnd this correlation may have been confounded by the presence in children of risk factors such as cardiopulmonary disease or of previous RSV infections, or by the use of diVerent molecular or virological techniques for RSV level evaluation [12] [13] [14] . The conXicting results could be also explained considering the diVerent bronchiolitis diagnostic criteria and/or clinical scores used in the various studies [8] [9] [10] 12] . Furthermore, we demonstrated that RSV load was positively correlated with the duration of hospital stay, an indirect indicator of the severity of RSV-associated illness. In agreement, other studies have reported higher nasal RSV load as a signiWcant independent predictor of longer hospitalization [9, 24] . However, in 23% of the infants in which we could measure RSV-RNA level at hospital discharge, an increase of viral load has been recorded.",

This protein has been implicated in the suppression of viral replication and protein translation and it seems also to be a mediator of negative-feedback regulation of virus-triggered induction of type I IFN and cellular antiviral response [30] . Interestingly it has been demonstrated that the nonstructural NS1 and NS2 proteins of RSV appear to antagonize both the cellular antiviral response as well as the induction of IFN transcription [31] [32] [33] . In addition Ling and coauthors have showed that NS2 inhibited ISG56 promoter activity induced by RNA-activated RIG-I in a dosedependent manner [34] . However, although RSV has evolved accessory gene products that neutralize or inhibit various steps of the IFN pathway, in our previous study we found a strong and a coordinated induction of IFN stimulated genes in the airway tract of infants with RSV infection [28] . Furthermore recently Pichlmair and coauthors have proposed that ISG56 protein antagonizes viruses by sequestering speciWc viral nucleic acids [35] .",
