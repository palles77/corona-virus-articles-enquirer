In this study, both pathogenic (passage 3, P3) and attenuated (P110) infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains were used to study the immune responses of chicken to IBV infection. Expression of avian \u03b2defensins (AvBDs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in 16 tissues of chicken were compared at 7 days PI. The results showed that P3 infection upregulated the expression of AvBDs, including AvBD2, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12, while P110 infection downregulated the expression of AvBDs, including AvBD3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 in most tissues. Meanwhile, the expression level of several TLRs showed a general trend of upregulation in the tissues of P3-infected chickens, while they were downregulated in the tissues of P110-infected chickens. The result suggested that compared with the P110 strain, the P3 strain induced a more pronounced host innate immune response. Furthermore, we observed that recombinant AvBDs (including 2, 6, and 12) demonstrated obvious anti-viral activity against IBV in vitro. Our findings contribute to the proposal that IBV infection induces an increase in the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of some AvBDs and TLRs, which suggests that AvBDs may play significant roles in the resistance of chickens to IBV replication.",

            "text": "Respiratory pathogens, including infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), continue to have serious health and economic impacts on the poultry industry (Cavanagh 2003; Fang et al. 2007) despite the existence of vaccination programs. IBV is a coronavirus that causes an acute, highly contagious respiratory disease, and some strains can also cause nephritis. In addition, the reproductive tract of layer and breeder birds can be affected, causing decreased egg quality and production. As well as being an economically relevant pathogen in poultry, IBV also bears close resemblance to human coronaviruses, such as the pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Up to date, while much progress has been made in understanding the adaptive immune response to these respiratory pathogens (Ignjatovic and Galli 1995; Gelb et al. 2005) , the innate immune response remains poorly characterized. The innate immune system is the first line of host defense against an invading viral pathogen, and the outcome of an infection is dependent on the ability of host cells to recognize the invading pathogen and activate appropriate signaling pathways (Liao et al. 2011 ). If the innate immune response fails, pathogens are susceptible to triggering what is referred to as a cytokine storm (Tisoncik et al 2012) . The innate immune responses activated Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00253-015-6786-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. as a result of virus interaction with host cells play an essential role in the outcome of viral infection. The response is induced by recognition of specific components of the infecting pathogenic microorganisms known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by special receptors (Garcia et al 2007; Takeuchi and Akira 2009; Liao et al 2011) . Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the members of such receptors. To date, ten TLRs have been identified in chickens, namely TLR1-1 (TLR1A), TLR1-2 (TLR1B), TLR2-1 (TLR2A), TLR2-2 (TLR2B), TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, TLR15, and TLR21. Interaction of TLRs with their specific ligands leads to an innate immune response, which leads to the expression and secretion of both pro-inflammatory cytokines and defensins as well (Abdel-Mageed et al. 2014) .",

            "text": "Cytokines and chemokines are key mediators that initiate immune responses and ultimately shape the adaptive immune responses via chemoattraction of adaptive immune cells, activation of macrophages, differentiation of Th1 from T cells and control of intracellular pathogens, promoting protective adaptive immunity, upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules required for antigen presentation, and prevention of fatal immunopathology. Furthermore, they may be involved in both clearance of pathogens and pathological tissue damage (Carpenter and O'Neill 2007; Quintana et al. 2011) . Defensins are small polypeptides that play an important role in the innate host defense against bacteria, fungi, and some viruses (Ganz and Lehrer 1999; Lehrer and Ganz 2002; Wang et al. 2010; Ma et al. 2011 Ma et al. , 2012a Ma et al. , b, c, 2013 Ma et al. , 2014 Barabas et al. 2013) . In addition to their antimicrobial effect, defensins have been shown to activate monocyte-derived dendritic cells and modulate interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 production in antigenpresenting cells, suggesting that they may also play a role in the shaping of adaptive immunity (Presicce et al. 2009; Nijnik et al. 2012; Quintana et al. 2011) . IBV infection of chickens causes an acute and highly contagious respiratory disease (Fang et al. 2007; Shen et al. 2004) . It initially infects the upper respiratory tract, where it is restricted to the ciliated and mucus-secreting cells (Raj and Jones 1997) . Following infection of chickens by IBV, IFN was detected in the trachea and lungs (Otsuki et al. 1987) . Meanwhile, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 were also greatly increased during IBV infection of cultured cells (Liao et al. 2011) . While the induction of cytokines has recently been observed in chickens infected with IBV (Pei et al. 2001; Liao et al. 2011) , the regulation of defensins in the tissues of chicken, and their significance in the pathogenesis of IBV, remains poorly described. In this study, we demonstrate that prestimulation with a pathogenic IBV strain (passage 3 (P3)) results in a beneficial expression of several avian \u03b2-defensins (AvBDs) in the tissues of chicken compared with an attenuated strain (P110). Our results further provide evidence that this regulation of AvBD expression may be ascribed to their antiviral effect against IBV and seems to be mediated by TLRs.",

Nucleic acid extractions were prepared from 50 \u03bcL of homogenized samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was air-dried for 2-10 min, redissolved in 40 \u03bcL of RNase-free water, and stored at \u221270\u00b0C until use. To evaluate RNA quality, the ODs of RNA at 260 and 280 nm were examined. The OD260 to OD280 ratios were within 1.8 to 2.2 (data not shown). All of the processes were performed under RNase-free conditions. One-step RT-PCR was performed using the One-step Realtime PrimeScript\u00ae RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian Co., LTD.) on a LightCycler\u00ae 480 II RT-PCR system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to previous studies (Ma et al. 2012a, b, c; Liu et al. 2013) . Serial tenfold dilutions of plasmids containing chicken 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), AvBDs 1-14; TLRs 1-5, 7, 15, and 21; and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were used as controls. Chicken TLRs 1-5 and 7 are the functional orthologs of mammalian TLRs 1-5 and 7, and chicken TLR15 and 21 have no orthologs in mammals (Keestra et al. 2013) . Plasmids containing these genes were stored in our laboratory. 18S rRNA was selected as the most stable reference gene across all samples from a panel of potential genes, including 18S rRNA, \u03b2-actin, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), from chickens (data not shown).

To analyze the expression of AvBDs 1-14 in the tissues of chicken in response to IBV infection, both highly pathogenic (P3) and attenuated (P110) IBV strains were used in this study. Sixteen tissues mentioned above were collected from chickens inoculated with the aforementioned viruses, as well as from control chickens. Compared with the control, both the P3 and P110 strains induced the expression of most of the AvBDs (Fig. 2) . Compared with control chickens, the expression of AvBD2 in the large intestine, cecum, cecal tonsil, and thymus; AvBD4 in the trachea and thymus; AvBD5 in the small intestine and thymus; AvBD6 in the kidneys, duodenum, small intestine, large intestine, bursa of Fabricius, and thymus; AvBD9 in the small intestine and thymus; and AvBD12 in the pancreas, small intestine, bursa of Fabricius, and Harderian glands of P3-infected chickens was upregulated. Interestingly, in contrast to the upregulation of expression observed in the tissues of P3-infected chickens, for P110-infected chickens, the expression of nearly all of the AvBDs investigated in this study was downregulated in most of the tissues. In addition, compared with the high level of expression in most of the tissues in both control and P3-infected chickens, the expression of AvBD10 was undetectable in the lung, pancreas, small intestine, and cecum of P110-infected chickens. Similarly, little expression of AvBD11 was detected in the proventriculus, liver, pancreas, small intestine, and Harderian gland in P110inoculated chickens. In addition, no significant differences in the expression of the other AvBDs were found in response to IBV infection. Because of their marked differences in expression in the tissues of chickens inoculated with IBV P3, as well as in P110-infected and control chickens, AvBD2, 6, and 12 were chosen for further analysis in the study.",

All assays were performed in triplicate, with five replicates per experiment, and each bar is the mean \u00b1 SD. The statistical significance of differences between groups of the control, P3, and P110 was assessed using the generalized linear model (GLM) procedure of SAS software (SAS 1996) . The values with different letters are significantly different (P<0.05) (Cavanagh 2003 (Cavanagh , 2007 Kameka et al. 2014 ). However, the emergence of new IBV variants, which led to infectious bronchitis outbreaks in vaccinated flocks, resulted in significant production losses (Xu et al. 2007; Shimazaki et al. 2009; Kameka et al. 2014 ). Therefore, a novel approach that could be used as an alternative to, or in addition to, the existing means of control is urgently needed. One such approach may be the use of innate immune mediators to empower the innate immune system. Generally, innate immunity induced by IBV occurs during the early phase of infection (e.g., 3-5 days after infection) . Our previous report showed that the immunogenicity of IBV strain CK/CH/LHLJ/04V decreased and that the immune response of chickens to a CK/CH/LHLJ/04V strain that was passaged 110 times in embryonated chicken eggs also delayed (Liu et al. 2009 ). None of the chickens showed seroconversion at 7 dpi with CK/CH/LHLJ/04V P110, and only 40 % of the P110-inoculated chickens showed seroconversion at 12 dpi (Liu et al. 2009 ). Hence, we investigated the differential modulation of AvBD and TLR expression in chickens infected with CK/CH/LHLJ/04V highly pathogenic P3 at 7 dpi in comparison with P110-infected and control chickens.",

These results suggested that \u03b2defensins, including AvBDs, play an essential role in the animal defense against viral infection. However, in contrast to the upregulation of expression that was observed in the tissues of P3-infected chickens, several AvBDs were downregulated in P110-infected chickens. It is likely that different signaling pathways of host were activated by the different IBVs with variant pathogenicity though the exact mechanism needed to be further investigated.

The values with different letters are significantly different (P<0.05) mRNA expression in both the large intestine and bursa of Fabricius in P3-infected chickens. These results paralleled the above findings that chickens infected with the P3 strain exhibited an increased production of AvBDs in digestive and immune organs. These observations are in accordance with earlier reports demonstrating that mouse \u03b2-defensin 2 activates immature dendritic cells through an interaction with TLR4 (Biragyn et al. 2001 ) and that human \u03b2-defensin 3 activates antigen-presenting cells via TLR1 and TLR2 in an nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB)-dependent manner (Funderburg et al. 2007 (Funderburg et al. , 2011 . Previous studies have also shown an increase in the mRNA expression of TLR2, TLR3, TLR6, and TLR7 following IBV immunization (Guo et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2006) . The nature and the extent of the innate host responses elicited against IBV are not known. Surprisingly, we did not detect significant changes in TLR3, 5, 7, 15, and 21 expression following infection with the P3 strain. In contrast, a previous study detected a significant increase in both TLR3 and TLR7 mRNA expression in the tracheas of Massachusetts-type IBV-infected chickens (Kameka et al. 2014) , which could be due to the use of different virulent vaccine strains in their study. However, because of the downregulation of mRNA expression that was observed for several AvBDs in most tissues in P110-infected chickens compared with P3-infected or control chickens, we were not surprised to see a similar decrease in the expression of TLRs in most of these tissues as well, though the reason was not known and needed to be further investigated. Furthermore, relationship between AvBD and TLR expression analysis showed that AvBDs (2, 4-6, 9-12) correlated positively with different TLRs (including 1-5, 7, and 21) from chickens infected by IBV.",

In contrast to the extensive studies on the antimicrobial activities of AvBDs, reports on the antiviral activity of such peptides, especially AvBDs, are limited.

As a result, the changes revealed by gene expression analysis of some genes such as AvBDs and TLRs that could also be expressed in immune cells in the course of viral infection may be caused or partly caused by cellular heterogeneity occurring during the inflammatory response to viral infection (including infiltration by innate and adaptive immune cells).
