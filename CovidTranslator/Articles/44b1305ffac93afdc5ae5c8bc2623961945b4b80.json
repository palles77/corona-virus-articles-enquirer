A total of 3181 cattle sera were tested. Of these sera, 1885 were from cattle which had not been exposed to FMD. A total of 1296 sera were either from cattle which were experimentally exposed to FMD virus or from cattle involved in field outbreaks. The results indicate that the ELISA has the same specificity as the AGID test, but is more efficient in detecting cattle exposed to FMD virus. The ELISA technique will probably prove to be a more satisfactory test in support of the prevention, control and eradication programs for the disease.",

The K99 antigen was demonstrated in 13.1% of 268 fecal swabs from 35.7% of farms (Table 1 ). In 15 of 35 calves, K99+ E. coliwas the only agent isolated; the remainder harbored mixed infections. Acres ( 1985 ) summarized the results of seven prevalence studies in the U.S.A. and Canada for enterotoxigenic E. coli in diarrheic calves; prevalence ranged from 6 to 31% (mean 18.3%, median 18%). Prevalence reports from other countries include: France, 0% (De Rycke et al., 1986 ) ; Britain, 3% of calves with diarrhea (Reynolds et al., 1986) ; U.S.A. (Idaho and Oregon), 6.6% (Bulgin et al., 1982) ; Britain, 7.9% in diarrheic calves and 0% in healthy controls (Snodgrass et al., 1986) ; Netherlands, 11% (Moerman et al., 1982) ; and U.S.A. Table  1 ). This differs from other reports, where isolation rates were higher from diarrhea calves than from controls (Sihvonen and Miettinen, 1985; Snodgrass et al., 1986) . Three of 32 (9.4%) calves from which K-99 antigen was detected were negative for immunoglobulins by the zinc sulfate test, and 20 of 215 (9.3%) calves from which K-99 was not identified were negative to the zinc sulfate test (X 2 0.11, P=0.75). K99+ E. coli identification by age of calf is shown in Table 3 . During the dry season (March and April), K99+ E. coli antigen was detected in 15 of 100 (15%) fecal swabs, and during the rainy season (May-August) it was detected in 20 of 168 fecal swabs (11.3%) (Z 2 0.29, P= 0.59). Isolation rates were similar for Holstein and Jersey calves.",

Others have reported rates approximately one-half as large (Reynolds et al., 1986 ) . However, the purpose of this study was not to assign causes to cases of diarrhea but rather to determine agent prevalence. In addition, the diarrhea rate in calves in the prospective study of which this study was a part was 36% for 1152 calves (D. Hird et al., unpublished data), higher than that reported elsewhere (Waltner-Toews , 1986b) ; this may indicate that many cases of diarrhea are not associated with infectious disease agents. Using data recorded for the continuing study, it was ascertained that for 96 of this study's control calves for which complete data were available, 22 had episodes of diarrhea recorded before selection as controls, 19 developed diarrhea after having been selected as controls, and 53 never developed diarrhea. For the 74 calves with no recorded diarrhea before selection as controls, the following percentages of control calves, grouped by agent first isolated, subsequently developed diarrhea: rotavirus, 4 of 6 (67%); K99 + E. coli, 5 of 12 (41.7%); coccidia, 2 of 17 ( 11.8%); and no agent isolated, 10 of 39 (25.6%). Comparison of agents isolated between control calves which subsequently developed diarrhea and their respective cases revealed that in only two instances was the same agent (rotavirus, K99+ E. coli) isolated from a casecontrol pair, indicating that the observed prevalence of disease agents in feces of control calves was not exaggerated by the proximity of diarrhea cases.",

None of 16 acute-convalescent sera pairs showed seroconversion at > 1 : 10 dilution. Cattle on the study farms were not vaccinated against viral diseases. Isolation of BHV 1 has been reported in Costa Rica (Rodriguez and Fernandez, 1987) , and a 16% seroprevalence in Costa Rican dairy cattle has been demonstrated (Donato, 1984 ) . In a study of Oregon and Idaho calves, a rate of 2.4% was reported (Bulgin et al., 1982) , and in Washington, an isolation rate of 10% in calves with signs of upper respiratory disease was reported (Evermann, 1979) . Antibodies to parainfluenza-3 virus were demonstrated in 23 of 28 (82.1%) acute sera and 1 of 16 (6.3%) acute-convalescent pairs showed seroconversion. In a Washington study, this virus was implicated in 10% of upper respiratory disease cases in calves, and in 8% of pneumonia cases (Evermann, 1979) . No cytopathic effect was observed in nasal swab suspension tested on BT cells; BT cells are susceptible to viruses of bovine virus diarrhea, IBR, PI-3, as well as bovine adenoviruses and enteroviruses (McClurkin et al., 1974 ) . In summary, our laboratory results did not indicate association of respiratory illness with presence of viral agents or antibodies against the viral agents tested.

The antigen is common for all seven types of FMD. Polatnick et al. ( 1967 ) established that VIA antigen is the viral RNA polymerase. McVicar and Sutmoller (1970) utilized the agar gel immunodiffusion test (AGID) to demonstrate that the presence of VIA antibody was indicative of previous FMD infection. However, Pinto and Garland (1979) and Ahl and Wittman ( 1986 ) showed that cattle vaccinated with formalin-or acetylethyleneimine-inactivated vaccines would occasionally react positively to the VIA antibody test. The VIA antigen for this test was produced in Escherichia coli using recombinant DNA techniques. Because of its low specificity, the test could only be used in periodic surveys to determine the prevalence and incidence of VIA antibodies.",

It is used for import/export testing and as an epidemiological tool to determine the spread of FMD virus in animal populations. The major drawback of the AGID assay is its low sensitivity, which motivated Morgan et al. (1978) to develop a purification procedure for VIA antigen (applicable in combination with other more sensitive techniques). These results stimulated us to examine the application of the ELISA technique for VIA antibody assay, as previously used by McCullough et al. (1985) and by Hamblin et al. (1986) to detect specific FMD epitopes and antibodies. We took advantage of the antigenic differences of the FMD virus types to make the assay system more specific. The capture IgG was prepared from FMD virus type C convalescent cattle serum. The VIA antigen was extracted from type A virus suspensions and the detector was produced by infecting and hyperimmunizing guinea pigs with virus type O. This procedure also avoided immune reactions between BHK proteins and serum components, which previously caused problems when we attempted to apply the indirect sandwich ELISA tests for the assay of cattle sera. The variability of the ELISA test employed was evaluated in five replicate titrations, performed with seven mixtures of convalescent cattle sera. The low coefficient of variation (18.5%) indicates a high reproducibility of the technique. The specificity of the test was determined by the assay of 1885 cattle sera, originating from FMD-free areas or from cattle prior to their use in vaccine potency tests in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. All of these sera tested negative in the ELISA system and in AGID.",

In an assay of 398 sera of experimentally infected cattle, the specificity of the ELISA test was 0.977. The assay of 898 sera from cattle involved in FMD outbreaks indicated a specificity of 0.919, but some of those cattle may not have been exposed to the virus. Vaccination and revaccination of cattle with vaccines containing high concentrations (18 and 54 pg per 5-ml dose) of non-purified FMD antigen induced high titers of VIA antibodies in a high percentage of the cattle. Similar vaccines with a lower antigen concentration (6 #g per 5 ml) did not induce the development of VIA antibodies (unpublished results ), suggesting a dependence on the non-purified antigen concentration in the vaccine.",

The high percentage of cattle with VIA antibodies following ALV vaccination shows that VIA antibody surveys are not useful to evaluate the spread of virulent FMD strains in the cattle population under such conditions. Vaccination campaigns based on revaccination of the cattle population at 4-month intervals can produce false positives with regard to infection. The collection of sera just prior to the next vaccination or of paired sera, 1 month apart, can partially avoid this obstacle. For the interpretation of the results, one should keep in mind the drastic drop which occurs in revaccinated cattle in comparison with the long persistence of VIA antibodies in convalescent cattle. However, we only presented data following one revaccination. More frequent revaccination may change this picture. It is suggested that a VIA antibody survey of the young-cattle population may be an excellent way to evaluate the presence or absence of FMD virus activity, principally in the population of areas under systematic FMD vaccination.",
