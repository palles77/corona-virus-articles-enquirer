A series of studies have shown that 25HC activity in hosts plays a vital role in inhibiting viral infection. In this study, we explored the antiviral effect of CH25H and 25HC on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which causes high mortality rates in newborn piglets with severe diarrhea, and considerable financial loss in the swine industry worldwide. Our results showed that PEDV infection downregulated the expression of CH25H in Vero cells. An overexpression and knockdown assay indicated that CH25H has significant antiviral action against PEDV, and a CH25H mutant (CH25H-M) that lacks hydroxylase activity also retains antiviral activity to a lesser extent. Furthermore, 25HC had a broad-spectrum antiviral effect against different PEDV strains by blocking viral entry. In addition, CH25H and 25HC inhibited the replication of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Taken together, CH25H as a natural host restriction factor could inhibit PEDV and TGEV infection.",

The PEDV genome comprises two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) encoding two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) and five other proteins, spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). Several mutations have been identified in the S (spike) 1 region in recent years. Small intestinal epithelial cells in vivo are primarily attacked by PEDV, which causes acute watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and anorexia in pigs of all ages (Li et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014) . After first being discovered in the 1970s in Europe, PEDV became widespread with significant mortality and morbidity, particularly in nursing piglets (Langel et al., 2016) . Although PEDV vaccines have been available in China, the preventive effect is not evident and infectious cases still occur in the swine industry. Therefore, new anti-PEDV methods are urgently needed.",

            "text": "For over 50 years, lipid components, including cholesterol and its derivatives, have been studied as important structural components of physiological processes. Crucial cellular processes require the maintenance of sterol homeostasis. As a family of transcription factors, the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are considered modulators of lipid biosynthesis. One antiviral lipid effector, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), is reportedly able to suppress cholesterol biosynthesis by repressing the activation of SREBPs (Holmes et al., 2011) . Newly translated SREBPs bind the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Under conditions of sterol depletion, this SREBP-SCAP complex is transported to the Golgi apparatus, and site-1 protease (S1P) and site-2 protease (S2P) are used to cleave SREBP into its mature transcription factor form (Olsen et al., 2011) . Under conditions of excess lipid, SCAP undergoes a conformational change that causes it to bind to insulin-induced genes (INSIGs). Retention of the SREBP-SCAP complex in the ER is accelerated by 25HC, not via direct action with SCAP, but through the overexpression of INSIGs that control the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, a degenerative-feedback mechanism for the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis has been recognized, which is associated with the expression of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) (Singaravelu et al., 2015) . Rapid proteasomal degradation can be effected by HMGCR through high cellular 25HC levels, independent of SREBPs (Singaravelu et al., 2015) . Therefore, 25HC has been regarded as an inhibitor of cholesterol.",

Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) encodes an ER-associated enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of cholesterol to 25HC (Blanc et al., 2013; Hotter et al., 2013) . Recent reports have revealed that CH25H inhibits many enveloped viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Liu et al., 2013) , human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Moog et al., 1998) , hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Anggakusuma et al., 2015) , Ebola virus (EBOV) (Liu et al., 2013) , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Song et al., 2017) , pseudorabies virus (PRV) and Zika virus (Li et al., 2017a) , as well as some non-enveloped viruses, such as human rotavirus and human rhinovirus (Fessler, 2016) .

In the present study, we investigated whether PEDV infection could upregulate CH25H expression in Vero cells.

The mRNA levels of CH25H and PEDV N protein were measured by qRT-PCR. In contrast, CH25H mRNA levels in Vero cells were significantly downregulated by PEDV infection with increasing time (Fig. 1A) and PEDV N protein mRNA levels were significantly increased with time (Fig. 1B) . In addition, Vero cells were treated with 20,000 IU/ mL IFN-\u03b1 (Song et al., 2017) and incubated for 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 36 h at 37\u00b0C.

In addition, CH25H was evidently not an ISG in Vero cells (Fig. 1C) , and MX2 mRNA levels were induced by IFN\u03b1 (Fig. 1D ).",

            "text": "Previous studies have indicated that CH25H has an antiviral effect against some viruses and generates antiviral activities through the production of 25HC. For example, CH25H restricts HCV replication through the obstruction of membranous web formation (Anggakusuma et al., 2015) ; CH25H inhibits PRV by blocking viral attachment and internalization ; 25HC reduces PRRSV infection by inhibiting viral penetration but does not affect adsorption, replication, or release of PRRSV (Ke et al., 2017) ; and 25HC suppresses Lassa virus infection through aberrant GP1 glycosylation (Shrivastava-Ranjan et al., 2016) . In the present study, the overexpression of CH25H or 25HC inhibited PEDV infection by impeding virion entry, which is similar to that observed in PRRSV. In addition, the catalytically inactive form of CH25H retains antiviral action against HCV and PRRSV (Chen et al., 2014) . We further investigated the antiviral activities of CH25H-M on PEDV. Similar results were observed, such that CH25H-M still restricted PEDV infection, although the antiviral effect was attenuated. These findings demonstrate that CH25H does not depend entirely on enzymatic activity against PEDV.",

The inflammatory effects are mediated by 25HC via activation of NF-\u03baB signaling, leading to the increased release of interleukin 6 and interleukin 8 (Rydberg et al., 2003) . In addition, LXR signaling may significantly affect inflammation via LXR-mediated trans-repression (Joseph et al., 2003) .",

Overexpression and knockdown of CH25H indicated that it has superior antiviral activity against PEDV. Further study revealed that Vero cells were pretreated with 25HC at the indicated concentrations for 1 h, and were then infected with the PEDV YZ strain (MOI of 0.01) to which 8 \u03bcg/mL trypsin was added. The various concentrations of 25HC were again added to infected cells at 37\u00b0C for 18 h. Cell samples were collected and examined by western blotting (B), qRT-PCR (C), and IFA (E).
