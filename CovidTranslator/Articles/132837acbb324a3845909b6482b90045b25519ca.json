Regardless of this measure the new infection has spread to several countries around the world. Here, we developed a method to study the dissemination of this infection by the airline routes and we give estimations of the time of arrival of the outbreaks to the different cities. In this work we show an analysis of the dispersion of this infection to other cities by airlines based on the classic model the Kermack and McKendrick complemented with diffusion on a graph composed of nodes which represent the cities and edges which represent the airline routes. We do several numerical simulations to estimate the date of arrival to different cities starting the infection at Wuhan, China and to show the robustness of the estimation respect to changes in the epidemiological parameters and to changes on the graph. we use Mexico City as an example. In this case, our estimate of the arrival time is between March 20 and March 30, 2020. This analysis is limited to the analysis of dispersion by airlines, so this estimate should be taken as an overestimate since the infection can arrive by other means. This model estimates the arrival of the infectious outbreak to Mexico between March 20 and March 30.",

Our method uses the Kermack and Mckendrick model to simulate the way the outbreak grows and evolves when it arrives to the different cities and, also we use classical diffusion on a graph, to model the way the infection travels between cities by the airline routes. 9 The purpose of using a simple model for our analysis is to have the least number of parameters, but with sufficient precision to be able to give an estimate of the date of arrival of the outbreak for example, to Mexico City. By this date, it is well established that infection by this type of coronavirus is transmitted person to person through drops expelled by an infected person when coughing or sneezing, it is also possible to be transmitted by contact with surfaces or objects contaminated with the virus and then one puts his hands to his mouth, eyes or nose. 10 There is evidence that once the infectious outbreak has started there is some homogeneity in its .

The setting of \u03bb for Hubei and for Guangdong gives \u03bb = 0.3. These estimates give an R 0 = 2.5, which is in very good agreement with the estimate of Joseph T Wu 12 of R0 = 2.53 and, is well into the interval of the estimations reported for JM Read. 13 The diffusion coefficient D was estimated using numerical simulations of the model and the fact that a new outbreak started in Singapore around February 15, 2020. This gives a diffusion coefficient D = 10 -6 . In Figure 1 the nodes of the graph represent cities that were chosen because their airports function as important distribution points to other airports. In the model, some of these nodes also function as a representation of other airports in the region, for example, the Paris node represents the main international airports of that European region: Paris, Amsterdam and, Frankfurt. Using this graph and the estimated epidemiological parameters, the model was solved numerically to study in several scenarios the time of arrival of the infection to Mexico City.",

As can be seen, this does not affect the high and width of the rest of the peaks and only delays the arrival of the rest of the nodes including node 8 of Mexico City by around of 4 days. This shows that changes not yet so small in R 0 do not substantially alter the result on the arrival of the outbreak at node 8. Simulations with R 0 = 3, when they era adjusted to match the outbreak in Wuhan also only anticipated the outbreak in Mexico City by 4 days. We performed other numerical simulations changing the R 0 in other nodes of the graph around 10% of its value, this changed the outbreaks at these nodes, but it did not change significantly, the date of arrival of the outbreak in Mexico City. Changes on the graph structure cutting some edges, meaning cancelling some airline routes, also did not modify significantly the date of arrival of the outbreak to the last node. Even cutting all the edges connecting to node 8 except one, only delayed the arrival of the outbreak to Mexico City around 6 days. Reducing the coefficient D has a larger impact on the delay of the outbreak, reducing D by one order of magnitude, from 10 -6 to 10 -7 , delayed the arrival of the outbreak to node 8 around 2 weeks.",

The coefficient that best controls the spread of infection in the rest of the cities, when this dispersion is by airlines, is the parameter D. Therefore, surveillance at airports should be strengthened, with special emphasis on those connecting Mexico directly or indirectly with Asian countries. Finally, this model shows that all these measures can only delay the arrival of SARS-CoV-2, but if it can be delayed long enough, it would be very important to have as much time as possible to establish the appropriate prevention and control measures. it will allow better management of the outbreak.",

The maximum of the first outbreak in red corresponding to Wuhan is reached around February 24, 2020, the peaks corresponding to nodes 2 through 7 are all one above the other, peak in violet, because the corresponding graph is all interconnected (they form what is called complete graph) if one excludes node 8, the remaining graph does not distinguish one node from the others. This numerical simulation also indicates that the maximum of the first curve reaches 0.23, this means that, at the maximum point of the graph, 23 percent of the urban area of Wuhan is infected. Data from Johns Hopkins University show that the number of reported cases is peaking at approximately 63,000. The urban area of Wuhan is around 20 million inhabitants (this is the population that serves Wuhan airport), 23% corresponds to 4,600,000, this indicates that for each case reported there are about 73 infected in the city. In this scenario, the infectious outbreak of node 8, peak in green, corresponding to Mexico City begins to grow between t=70 and t=80, which gives an arrival of the infectious outbreak to Mexico between March 20 and 30, blue vertical line.

For this reason new methods and techniques have been developed to qualitatively understand this type of phenomenon. Methods In 1927 doctors Kermack and McKendrick developed a mathematical model to the study the Spanish Influenza pandemic of 1921. 6 This model, with some modifications, was used for forecasts and analysis of the 2009 influenza outbreak in Mexico City.",
