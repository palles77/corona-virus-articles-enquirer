However, so far no drug against HIV-1 infection exhibiting this mechanism of action has been approved. To identify new potent candidates for inhibitors, we performed in silico screening of a commercial database of more than 1,300 drug-like compounds by using receptorbased docking studies. The candidates selected from docking studies were subsequently tested using biological assays to assess anti-HIV activities. As a result, two compounds were identified as the most active. Specifically, both exhibited anti-HIV activity against viral replication at a low concentration and relatively low cytotoxicity at the effective concentration inhibiting viral growth by 50 %.",

The formation of complexes between CypA and CsA, which is an 11mer cyclic peptide isolated from the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum, allows CypA to interact with calcineurin, reduce the production of interferon \u03b3 and interleukin-2, and exert immunosuppressive effects [1] . CypA is one of 15 known human cyclophilins, and can catalyze cis-trans isomerization in peptide bonds containing proline via its peptidyl prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity. Recently, it was reported that CypA interacts with the NS5A and NS5B parts of hepatitis C virus polymerase [2, 3] , the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS coronavirus [4] , and the capsid (CA) protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [5] . These multiple functions make CypA an attractive target for drug development.",

The best docking pose to emerge from our docking differed from the original conformation only by 0.261 \u00c5 in root mean square deviation (RSMD). Therefore, we selected the pose displaying the lowest docking score as the best pose.

The most important residues of this cavity were identified by site-directed mutagenesis (Arg55, Phe60, Phe113, and His126) [20] . This cavity has also been called Site A or the MVA11-binding pocket (according to CsA binding mode) in previous reports [8, 21] . Over a saddle-like region, there is another hydrophobic pocket called Site B, or the Abu2-binding pocket. In addition to Sites A and B, there is also some empty space above, referred to here as Site C (Fig. 1b) . Although the cocrystallographic data of the CypA/CA fragment indicate that Site A should be the direct docking site, Sites B or C could be considered an auxiliary cavity when compounds possess important elongated functional groups.

This assay system can evaluate the inhibitory effects of test compounds in a single replication cycle of HIV-1. The results demonstrated that most of the other tested compounds either did not exert noticeable inhibitory effects on HIV-1 replication or exhibited strong cytotoxicity at higher concentrations (Table 1) . Moreover, although compound 4 exerted an inhibitory effect on viral replication, it displayed low solubility (Table 1) ; therefore, we did not evaluate this compound further. By contrast, two of our compounds, 12 and 23, as well as the two positive control compounds, exerted potent inhibitory effects on HIV-1 replication while exhibiting low cytotoxicity at the effective concentration inhibiting viral growth by 50 % (Fig. 5) . Compared with the control compounds D4 and FD8, our hit compounds exhibited stronger inhibitory activities. (Fig. 6a) , whereas that of 12 utilized Mode 2 binding (Fig. 6b) . The interactions were first assessed using the Ligand Interactions module in MOE. These analyses provided direct schematic views of the interactions of 23 and 12 with CypA, as shown in Fig. 7a and c, respectively. Compound 23 inserted into both Site A and Site B. Figure 7a and b illustrate the dimensional interaction maps and docking poses, respectively, of 23 with CypA. The presence of 2-nitrobenzenesulfonamide appears responsible for the binding between 23 and Site A of CypA. The oxygen atom in the sulfonamide group interacts with the nitrogen atom at the \u03c9 position of Arg55 (23: O -CypA: Arg55: N \u03c9 ) within a distance of 2.9 \u00c5. The aromatic ring of nitrobenzene interacts with both Gln63 and Phe113. Two edge-to-end (T-shaped) hydrogen-aromatic ring interactions (23:aromatic ring-CypA:Gln63:H and 23:aromatic hydrogen-CypA:Phe113:aromatic ring) form a \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking network. Because Arg55 and Phe113 are important pocketforming residues and are highly conserved in most CypA isolates, these interactions are very meaningful for inhibitor design. Another key interaction revealed in the interaction map is the hydrophobic interaction between Ala103 and the triazole group of 23. For 12, arene-cation interactions (12: benzene ring-CypA: Arg55: NH1 and NH2) were detected. As mentioned above, Arg55 is a critical residue for ligand binding. These interactions can partly explain the activity of 12.",

However, it is difficult to determine the detailed intermolecular energies, particularly in terms of hydrophobic interactions. Therefore, we performed additional post-docking analyses. The interactions between binding site residues and active compounds were scrutinized using IF-E 6.0 [18] (created by Dr. Hooman Shadnia at Carleton University, http://www.shadnia.com/H_IFE/index.htm), retrievable from the SVL exchange service. This program can differentiate favorable ligand-residue interactions from unfavorable ones by force vectors and energy values. A negative sign indicates a stable interaction, whereas a positive sign indicates an unstable or repulsive interaction. The results of 23 and 12 for each residue near ligand atoms (less than 4.5 \u00c5 in distance) are presented in Fig. 8 . For 23, in addition to the important residues mentioned above, we can see that Ala101 is also responsible for binding (Fig. 8a) . The carbon in the Ala101 backbone is in approximation with the carbonyl oxygen of 23 (separated by 3.57 \u00c5) (Fig. 7a) . The dispersion force between the electronpoor environment of the Ala101 backbone carbon and the electron-rich environment of the carbonyl oxygen of 23 resulted in good binding effects. For 12, the negative-signed interaction energy values, which indicate favorable residues for ligand binding, could be detected at multiple residues of CypA including the aforementioned residue Arg55. In addition to Arg55, other favorable residues for binding are listed in Fig. 8b . Conversely, a strong signal for a positive-signed peak could be detected at Ala103, suggesting that it is an unfavorable residue for the binding of 12. By assessing atomic distances, we found that the methyl hydrogen atom of the Ala103 side chain and the aromatic hydrogen atom of 12 are approximately 1.8 \u00c5 apart (Fig. 7d) . It can be concluded that the two hydrogen atoms clash with each other. However, it should be underlined that this docking pose was obtained from a rigid receptor docking procedure; therefore, this model cannot explain any \"inducedfitting\" phenomena. We assume that, due to the strong repulsion detected, the receptor residue should shift into a more appropriate orientation in a real system.",

Twenty-nine compounds selected from a database, together with control compounds, were examined for antiviral activities. Two of the compounds exhibited comparatively good effects in biological assays. In particular, compounds 12 and 23 both exhibited anti-HIV-1 activities with relatively low cytotoxicity at the effective concentration inhibiting viral growth by 50 %. From our experimental results, 12 and 23 may be used as lead compounds for novel type of anti-HIV inhibitors, although biochemical experiments to confirm that the target is really CypA are still needed.",
