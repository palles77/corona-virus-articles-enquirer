Individuals with disabilities also face the same obstacles for their out-of-home medical visits. In addition, people living in remote areas often do not get the needed health care attention unless they are willing to spend the time, effort and cost to travel. Advances in information and telecommunication technologies have made telemedicine possible. Using the latest sensor technologies, a person's vital data can be collected in a smart home environment. The bio-information can then be transferred wirelessly or via the Internet to medical databases and the healthcare professionals. Using the appropriate sensing apparatus at a smart home setting, patients, elderlies and people with disabilities can have their health signals and information examined on a realtime and archival basis. Recovery process can be charted on a regular basis. Remote emergency alerts can be intercepted and responded quickly. Health deterioration can be monitored closely enabling corrective actions. Medical practitioners can therefore provide the necessary healthrelated services to more people. This paper surveys and compiles the state-of-the-art smart home technologies and telemedicine systems.",

Other terms that often used interchangeably, in conjunction with, or under the umbrella of telemedicine, include telehealthcare, telemonitoring, e-health, e-care, ambient assisted living, smart homecare etc. All these terminologies, though, have the same objectives of delivering remote healthcare to an individual's home and enabling continuous health monitoring and emergency management.",

With unaccommodating transportation, and crowed hospitals and clinics in most cities, it is difficult for the elderlies and physically challenged to venture out of their homes to meet with health professionals for the needed treatment or for their routine clinical check-ups. Similarly, healthcare delivery in remote rural areas is a demanding endeavour. Having the capability of delivering healthcare services at the patients' home not only saves a great deal in monetary and human resources, but it also reduces response time in emergency situations. This is especially beneficial in the case where a large number of patients can be dealt with via communication technologies quickly from a centralized location without sending medical personnel to their individual homes.",

It was found that monthly home telemonitoring of cardiorespiratory signals being sent to a centralized interactive voice responding system is feasible and patients' compliance is high. The SM4All (Smart hoMes for ALL) project initiated by the European commission aims to provide a middleware platform for pervasive embedded service in a smart environment (Baldoni 2009 ).

A home patient monitoring system proposed by Figueredo and Dias (2004) uses a simple RS232 serial interface to connect a mobile phone to patient monitoring devices, and transmits vital signs over the internet to the hospital. vNurse is a system developed by Rehunathan et al. (2011) that uses the smart phone platform to provide secure and remote patient monitoring. Bio-data in vNurse are collected from a wireless body network and transmitted using mobile networks with IP (internet protocol) connection. Multi-agent systems are commonly found in smart telehealth applications. One of the earliest telemedicine projects, the independent lifestyle assistant, incorporates techniques in sensing model, distress situation detection, network response planning and machine learning (Haigh et al. 2002) . The Assistant is implemented as a multi-agent oriented assistive living architecture. Liao et al. (2009) presented a telemonitoring architecture based on mobile agents and they also addressed the issues of reliability, security, and manageability of this platform. Bramanti et al. (2010) employed GIS (geographical information system) technology to identify the optimal locations of clinics that could provide neurological telemedicine services to patients. A remote-client, servicecenter architecture was proposed that uses 3G/CDMA network and the internet to transfer vital sign information and medical analysis reports (Zhang et al. 2010) .",

The occupant's health state and the environmental information are important parameters to monitor and track. Different types of sensors can be used to detect vital signs such as ECG (electrocardiogram) for heart rate, EMG (electromyogram) for muscle activities, and blood pressure monitor for hypertension, while accelerometer, microphone, light sensor, air pressure recorder, and humidity indicator can be used to detect motion and location (Fraile et al. 2010 ). In addition to signals obtained from sensors that are attached to the body or physical measurement devices in the home, there are other media that could be monitored such as video and sound. Though, sound is the preferred medium due to privacy concerns. Smart home technology 537 Istrate et al. (2006) team developed a sound analysis system to detect and classify alarming sounds in a noisy environment. Using wavelet technology to process sound signals, their system achieves good performance comparable to other systems using different monitoring technologies. Laydrus et al.

Papamatthaiakis and colleagues (2010) presented an indoor activity recognition system for the elderlies. Using association rules and Allen's temporal relations, they claimed a 100 % recognition rate in identifying everyday activity such as bathing, preparing meals, doing laundry, etc. The MavHome project aims to provide a smart and adaptive environment for inhabitants (Jakkula et al. 2007) . In order to meet the goals of comfort and efficiency in MavHome, health trend monitoring and prediction are made using support vector machine and forecasting tools based on time series data collected in a sensor network. Huo et al. (2009) presented a healthcare environment for the elderlies using a home sensor network and a body sensor network. The interesting aspects of this work lie in the functionalities provided, including outdoor monitoring, and emergency decision and alarms. Various communication techniques, such as automated telephone call, SMS and email, are integrated into the system, transmitting emergency signals to caregivers and family members. Smart decision-making using hidden Markov model is proposed to speed up the decision process, increase the accuracy of event detection, minimise measurement errors, and correct transmission errors. Franco et al. (2010) proposed the use of passive infrared sensors placed in the living quarters of an elderly person to detect abnormal changes in behavior. This system would allow early admission of dependent care for those who show a shift in daily routine, for example, individuals with Alzheimer disease. The monitoring of behavioural changes is an area of interest in telehealth since the onset of certain alarming situations could be detected and healthcare professionals could then be notified. The next section focuses on using smart healthcare system to handle emergency.",

Advances in wireless technology have driven down the cost of ad-hoc networks, and with fewer attending field personnel, Smalls et al.'s approach may prove to be cost effective in the very near future. Wouhaybi et al. (2010) also proposed a system with similar objectives but they focused on the reduction of false alarm using a rule-based decision system.

They found the system is acceptable to patients, functionally satisfactory in the home environment, and very reliable in the collection of objective data. Capomolla et al.

Their study showed that home telemonitoring is more effective than usual care in reducing healthcare requirements and can improve outcome in CHF patients. Raju et al.

They reported on their extensive literature search and felt that the findings are inconclusive and well-designed protocols are necessary to conduct further large-scale investigations. Zhang and Bai (2005) used a queueing model to evaluate the performance of a home ECG and blood pressure monitoring system based on trial data over a 4-month period. Their objective was to study the traffic load, response time, and scalability of the system. The results are more than satisfactory and show great potential of the examined monitoring system. de Toledo et al.

            "text": "Due to the sensitive nature of health information, privacy is an important issue in data transmission and storage in telehealth systems. Without proper and established protocols and regulations in place, telemedicine would not be used widely as many people are concerned with the Smart home technology 541 privacy of their health information. Kotz and colleagues (2009) compared existing privacy frameworks, identified a set of desirable privacy properties in mobile healthcare systems, and used their findings to propose a privacy framework. They also raised several privacy issues and questions that need to be addressed by technical people, governmental agencies and regulatory organisations. Reliability is another critical factor in the implementation of smart homecare. Wireless technologies make telehealth care possible, however, such networks that operate in hostile outdoor environment have many reliability issues. Using rural China as a case study, Fong and Pecht (2010) identified and reviewed the factors that can impact on the reliability of telehealth care networks: physical obstacles, atmospheric absorption, inadequate fade margin and system failure. Gaddam et al. (2008) studied extensively the various issues related to the implementation of sensor networks for home healthcare and emergency. They have identified potential challenges including interoperability and interference, real-time data acquisition and processing, reliability and robustness, energy conservation, data management, data privacy and security, and comfort and unobtrusive operation. In addition, design issues for wireless networks considered are deployment of sensor nodes, mobility of wireless sensor, cost and size of the wireless node, infrastructure of the network, network coverage, network size, power management, life-time of the sensor networks, and quality of service requirements in such networks.",
