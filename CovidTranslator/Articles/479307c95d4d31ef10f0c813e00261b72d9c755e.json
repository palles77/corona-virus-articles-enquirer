            "text": "Monitoring and surveillance for viruses that affect swine are crucial in the prevention and control of diseases that can cause severe economic losses to the swine populations of Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) and the wider Caribbean region. To date, there have been limited or no published studies investigating the prevalence of viruses circulating in T&T's swine populations. In late 2015, according to the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) database, Columbia reported to have experienced classical swine fever (CSF) limited to one or more zones and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) was reported to be present in Columbia and Suriname. Viruses such as classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), and swine influenza virus (SwIV) have been reported to be circulating in Venezuelan swine herds (Kwiecien 2013) . The close proximity (7 km) of Trinidad to Venezuela, and the known illegal trade of animals and animal products between the two countries, renders Trinidad a high-risk location for the introduction of these viruses.",

Understanding the background levels of these viruses in swine populations in T&T will enable the development of science-based risk assessments, thus aiding the successful prevention, management, and control of future viral outbreaks within T&T and the Caribbean region. This will improve the health status and productivity of swine and pork production in T&T.",

The amount of pigs sampled in this study was constrained by issues of free access to farms. Many farmers were reluctant to allow their pigs to be sampled due to the invasive nature of the blood sampling procedure and the resulting high levels of stress caused to the animals. The more common approach to determining sample size in this type of study uses the formula developed by Cannon and Roe (1982) where P is the anticipated population proportion which is assumed at 70% and Z is 1.96 which is the approximate value of the 97.5 percentile point of a normal distribution curve used to construct approximate 95% confidence intervals. This value is found using a Z \u03b1/2 table where the confidence level used is 95% and \u03b1 is 0.05. Using the Canon and Roe formula, the sample size n was calculated to be 322 samples; however, to reduce the number of pigs to be sampled further, the confidence can be relaxed (decreased) and the tolerance, increased (Humphry et al. 2004 ) allowing for a sample size of 309.",

The primary economic impact is related to retarded weight gain resulting in an increase in the number of days to reach market weight (Organization for Animal Health 2009). In the UK, the financial loss resulting from reduced weight gain in finishing pigs alone due to SwIV has been estimated at approximately \u00a37 per pig (Morilla et al. 2008) . In this study, antibodies against (Rajao et al. 2013) . The 37% seroprevalence found in pigs of T&T is therefore consistent with similar studies carried out in Central and North American countries and suggests that SwIV is endemic in the Trinidadian domestic swine population, but not Tobago. In order to detect the likely strains of SwIV circulating in the pigs, a selection of 12 ELISA positive samples were further tested using HIT. A combination of H3N2 strains was selected to try to understand the relative incidence of H3N2 in pigs within the country. Due to significant antigenic diversity, strains were selected from both European pigs, which may be representative of global strains but also more recent human strains, given the frequency of transmission from humans to pigs which may result in the establishment of a stable lineage of virus. The pandemic strain pH1N1 2009 was also included, which is known to be present in pigs worldwide at present.",

Interestingly, it is well known that many of the pig populations of Trinidad originated from Minnesota farms indicating a potential introduction pathway. High titers of this strain were observed in the samples tested which would be indicative of quite recent exposure/active circulation of such viruses. One of the samples showed quite a high titer against the A/Perth/16/09 H3N2 strain which is a contemporary human virus that does not have a stable lineage in pigs. As expected, reactivity to the European viruses was low as there is very little transfer of swine between Europe and Trinidad.

These factors are akin to those which defined traditional influenza epicenters in Southeast Asia (Ma et al. 2009 ). Personal hygiene, the granting of sick leave to pig handlers showing flu-like symptoms, as well as biosecurity, should therefore be encouraged on both small-and large-scale farms. Such measures should include risk assessment checks for visitors, the use of protective clothing, respiratory protection for people to reduce viral dissemination (zoonotic and reverse zoonotic), handwashing before and after handling animals, restriction on sharing of equipment and tools between farms, and controls relating to the movement of animals and vehicles in and out of the farm.

            "text": "Porcine parvovirus (PPV) causes severe economically devastating reproductive symptoms in breeding sows. It is known to cause abortion and is associated with stillbirths, mummifications, embryonic death, and infertility (SMEDI). PPV infection is one of the most common and important causes of infectious infertility in swine. PPV is ubiquitous and worldwide in its distribution; it is therefore an infection which needs to be carefully managed (Porcine Parvovirus, The Pig Site 2014). This study identified 87 out of the 309 serum samples (28%) as antibody positive for PPV. Interestingly, markedly different levels of seroprevalence for antibodies to PPV were observed across the different swine farms in T&T with seroprevalence levels on farms ranging from 12 to 92% (Fig. 2b) . Antibodies were not observed in any of the pigs sampled on two of the largest farms in Trinidad, suggesting that the biosecurity and husbandry measures practiced on these two farms may be effective at stopping this introduction of PPV onto the farms. Interestingly, despite the relatively high seroprevalence for PPV observed in Trinidadian domestic pigs, there are limited reports of reproductive problems in the pigs. This could be due to farmers simply not reporting reproductive issues on their farms when they occur or alternatively could be due to a state on endemic stability on the affected farms, meaning that all the breeding sows are being infected with PPV prior to their first pregnancy. On the farms that contained serologically positive pigs, it was found that all the breeding sows that were sampled on these farms had antibodies to the virus prior to their first pregnancy, which would explain the lack of PPVrelated reproductive clinical signs reported to the veterinary services. It is, however, very important to note that some pig farms in Trinidad, and all the pigs sampled on Tobago, tested negative for PPV antibodies. These PPV-negative farms should be particularly careful when bringing pigs into their farms, ensuring that they avoid the introduction of PPVpositive animals. These farmers should ensure that they test all pigs for PPV antibodies and antigen prior to introduction, or alternatively, they should vaccinate their breeding sows prior to their first pregnancy. All pig farmers from PPVnegative farms should be advised of the importance of maintaining high levels of biosecurity in order to keep their farms free of PPV.",

In light of this, Tobago pig farmers should be encouraged to maintain a closed system. Tobago has approximately 20 small backyard pig farms throughout the island, 10 of which were sampled. These Tobago pig farmers usually breed and rear their pigs on their farms and may occasionally buy replacement sows from neighboring farms in Tobago to reduce excessive inbreeding. Pig farmers from Tobago should therefore be advised to avoid importing pigs from Trinidad and should maintain their current husbandry practices in order to ensure that their pigs remain seronegative for SwIV and PPV. Any pigs, including boars, coming into the country should be quarantined and tested for the presence of these viruses. Farmers from Tobago should be educated on the serological situation of their pigs and be made aware of the risks they face in the event of their na\u00efve pigs becoming exposed to these viruses.

If pigs are left unvaccinated for PCV-2, producers could see up to a US$20 loss per pig (Thacker 2013) . High seroprevalences (82.4%) of pigs for PCV-2 antibodies have been reported in Canada (Liu et al. 2002) , the USA (80%) (Nawagitgul et al. 2002) , Taiwan (83.5%) (Wang et al. 2004) , Northern Ireland (>55%) (Walker et al. 2000) , and Columbia (83.6%) (Monroy et al. 2014 ). In the present study, the overall seroprevalence for PCV-2 antibodies in T&T pigs was found to be 66%. There is, however, little to no evidence for PCV-2-associated diseases in T&T pigs. Given the high seroprevalence for PCV-2 observed in the T&T pigs, there is clearly a need to closely monitor pig herds for evidence of PCV-2-associated diseases. Routine surveillance for clinical signs and the regular examination of specimens from abattoirs should be adopted. Farmers should also be encouraged to adopt sound husbandry practices such as age segregation, good sanitation as well as measures to minimize stress and avoid overcrowding. The application of these measures is essential to avoid the development of diseases in pigs that are associated with PCV-2 infection such as post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS).",

For SIV, seropositive and virus-positive pigs have been found to have significantly decreased growth performance compared to seronegative pigs, even though feed intake was not decreased. Reduced feed conversion efficiency led to lower average daily growth, additional feed requirements, and longer time needed to reach the 100 kg body weight (Er et al. 2014 ).
