In this study, an IBV, CK/CH/2010/JT-1, was isolated from an H120-and 4/91-IBV-vaccinated flock in China. Antisera against vaccine strains H120 and 4/91 could not provide effective protection against CK/CH/2010/JT-1 in virus neutralization assays. CK/CH/2010/JT-1 could cause 43.75% mortality with respiratory and severe renal lesions in inoculated chickens. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene showed that CK/CH/2010/JT-1 and 31 other isolates could be grouped as a new genotypic cluster. Recombination analysis revealed that three recombination events could be found in the genome of CK/ CH/2010/JT-1 at positions 24709-365, 17160-19811 and 21136-21770. Whole-genome sequence analysis showed that CK/CH/2010/JT-1 originated from multiple template switches among QX-like, CK/CH/LSC/ 99I-, tl/CH/LDT3/03-and 4/91-type IBVs. All of these data demonstrated that CK/CH/2010/JT-1 is a new recombinant genotype IBV with high virulence. Our findings suggest that the surveillance of new genotype strains of IBV is very important for developing more effective anti-IBV strategies.",

IBV variants have been continuously emerging in China Xue et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2014) . The nature of the large, single-RNA genome of IBV makes the virus variable through recombination or mutation. Recombination can cause the emergence and evolution of different IBV genotypes and different species of coronaviruses (Jackwood et al., 2010) . More and more recombination events have been reported in IBV, and they are distributed throughout the entire genome (Brooks et al., 2004; Kuo et al., 2013; Thor et al., 2011) . Recently, a new recombinant cluster of nephropathogenic IBVs able to cause death, respiratory signs and nephritis in infected chickens emerged in Korea (Lim et al., 2011 (Lim et al., , 2015 . Therefore, studies on the function of recombination in the antigenicity and pathogenicity of IBV are very important, potentially allowing IBV evolution to be predicted and better strategies for IBV control to be developed.",

Serum samples collected from chickens that survived were checked for IBV antibodies using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME, USA). The endpoint titres were calculated according to the manufacturer's instructions, and titres of more than 396 were considered positive for IBV antibody. All experiments complied with the institutional animal care guidelines and were approved by the University of Yangzhou Animal Care Committee.",

Inoculated egg death appeared at the 4th passage, and the inoculated eggs had all died by the 6th-10th passages. The virus was identified as IBV by RT-PCR and named CK/CH/2010/JT-1. The complete genome sequence of CK/CH/2010/JT-1 was obtained by assembling 25 overlapping sequences, with a 27670-nucleotide genome. The complete genome encodes several different genes, and components of the related genes are ordered 5 0 UTR -1a-1b-S-3a,b,c(E)-M-4b-5a,b-N-UTR3 0 . Sequence analysis showed that CK/CH/2010/ JT-1 shares the highest complete genome sequence identity with GX-YL9 (96.3%) and GX-YL5 (96.1%) but only 44.3%-89.2% S1 nucleic acid identity with 59 reference strains (Fig. 1) . BLASTN analysis showed that the S1 gene of CK/CH/2010/JT-1 shares 90%-99% similarity with 78 isolates from China in recent years. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene of IBVs revealed that CK/CH/2010/JT-1 and 31 other isolates described in BLASTN analysis are grouped as a new cluster (Fig. 1) , which is separated from the previously identified serotypes and genotypes.",

However, the IB vaccine program has not been very effective, as new IBV serotypes, genotypes and variants are sometimes isolated from vaccinated chickens (Feng et al., 2015; Han et al., 2011) . This study identified an IBV, CK/CH/2010/JT-1, and 31 other isolates grouped into a novel genotypic cluster different from previously identified genotypes. Although 23 of the 31 isolates were reported in other five papers, we found that among the 23 isolates, 13 isolates were clustered into a genotype with reference strains A2 and QXIBV (Luo et al., 2012) , 9 isolates were grouped with reference strains 4/91 and UK 7/93 (Feng et al., 2014; Ji et al., 2011; Li et al., 2010) , and one isolate showed far evolutionary distances with reference tl/CH/LDT3/03 strains, but grouped into tl/CH/LDT3/03-type . In our study, the CK/CH/2010/JT-1 and 31 strains showed a low S1 nucleic acid identity with reference strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene showed these strains could be grouped as a new genotypic cluster which was different from the previously identified genotypes IBV in China. Some vaccines, such as Mass-type H120 and 4/91-type 4/91 vaccine strains, could not provide effective protection against CK/CH/2010/JT-1 infection. In addition, the CK/ CH/2010/JT-1-like isolates form a new genotypic cluster, which is similar to a new IBV cluster in Korea (Lim et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are identified in a wide variety of animals and divided into three distinct groups based on genotypic and serological characterization (Brian and Baric, 2005; Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . Coronaviruses have a high frequency of recombination due to the unique mechanism of viral replication. IBV is a member of the genus Gamma Coronavirus. Novel IBV variants could emerge mainly via two approaches: recombination and mutation Toro et al., 2012) . In this paper, we found the CK/CH/2010/JT-1-like strains underwent three recombination events. The recombination fragments were located in approximate positions 17160-24708, 19812-23876 and 21136-21770 . The genome approximate positions 1-17159 and 24709-27670, 17160-19811 and 23868-24708, 19812-21135 and 21171-23867, and 21136-21770 of the CK/CH/2010/JT-1-like IBV possibly arose from CK/CH/LSC/99I-type, QX-like, tl/CH/LDT3/03-type and 4/91-type IBVs respectively (Fig. 3B ). However the chronological order of the recombination events needs further investigation. Recently, nine genotypes of IBV have been circulating in China. The predominant genotype is QX-like IBV, which has spread widely in Asia, Europe and Africa since it was first reported in 1996 in China (Cook et al., 2012; Knoetze et al., 2014; Toffan et al., 2011) . The second dominant genotype detected in China is the CK/CH/LSC/ 99I-type . The co-circulation of QX-like, CK/CH/ LSC/99I, vaccine, tl/CH/LDT3/03 and 4/91 genotype strains in the same chicken farm provided the possibility of new recombinants like CK/CH/2010/JT-1. Previous studies found that the recombination hot spots tended to be located in the 1a (nsp2 and nsp3), 1b (nsp16), S1, envelope, membrane genes and the 3 0 UTR . Most of the recombination breakpoints identified in isolate CK/CH/2010/JT-1 are located in these genes. To our knowledge, this recombinant virus is different from those in other reports Wu et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2014) . All these data indicate that the new isolate is recombined with homologous RNA recombination events from multiple template switches among QX-like, CK/CH/LSC/99I-, tl/CH/LDT3/ 03-and 4/91-type IBV strains.",

            "text": "A new genotype virus could acquire new biological characteristics, including virulence from gene recombination. The IBV spike and replicase genes are known to be determinants of pathogenicity (Armesto et al., 2009; Wickramasinghe et al., 2011) . The spike gene also plays a key role in IBV tissue tropism (Wickramasinghe et al., 2011) . The Mass-type M41 and 4/91-type 793/B could cause the respiratory signs without death in infected chickens (Benyeda et al., 2009) . Recently, the Chinese QX-like IBV virulent strains were found to cause 10%-50% mortality in infected chickens (Feng et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2011) , while the virulent CK/CH/LSC/99I-type strains YN and ck/CH/LDL/07I and the tl/CH/LDT3/03-type strain tl/CH/LDT3/03 caused 65%, 30%, and 80% mortality with severe kidney lesions in infected chickens, respectively (Feng et al., 2012 (Feng et al., , 2015 Liu et al., 2005) . The isolate CK/CH/2010/JT-1 could cause respiratory and severe renal disease and resulted in deaths of 43.75% experimental infections of 3-day- old SPF chickens. These results indicate the CK/CH/2010/JT-1 isolate is highly virulent. The replicase gene of isolate CK/CH/2010/ JT-1 was derived from QX-like, CK/CH/LSC/99I-and tl/CH/LDT3/03type strains, and the spike gene possibly originated from 4/91-and tl/CH/LDT3/03-type strains. All of these features yield 43.75% mortality with respiratory and severe renal disease in CK/CH/2010/ JT-1 infected chickens. The altered 4/91 fragment in the spike gene may not affect the tissue tropism of isolate CK/CH/2010/JT-1; the tissue tropism of the virus may have more than one pathogenicity factor, an issue to be studied in the future.",
