Inoculation of IDV to na\u00efve calves resulted in mild respiratory disease histologically characterized by tracheitis. As several studies have associated the presence of IDV with acute bovine respiratory disease (BRD), we sought to investigate the efficacy of an inactivated IDV vaccine. Vaccinated calves seroconverted with hemagglutination inhibition titers 137-169 following two doses. Non-vaccinated calves challenged with a homologous virus exhibited signs of mild respiratory disease from days four to ten post challenge which was significantly different than negative controls at days five and nine post challenge. Peak viral shedding of approximately 5 TCID 50 /mL was measured in nasal and tracheal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids four to six days post challenge. Viral titers were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased 1.4 TCID 50 /mL, 3.6 TCID 50 /mL and 5.0 TCID 50 /mL, respectively, in the aforementioned samples collected from vaccinated animals compared to non-vaccinated controls at peak shedding. Viral antigen was detected in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal turbinates and trachea by immunohistochemistry from all unvaccinated calves but in significantly fewer vaccinates. Inflammation characterized by neutrophils was observed in the nasal turbinate and trachea but not appreciably in lungs. Together these results support an etiologic role for IDV in BRD and demonstrate that partial protection is afforded by an inactivated vaccine.",

While serological surveys of swine and human sera found low antibody prevalence (9.5 and 1.3%, respectively), several studies have found that IDV antibodies are nearly ubiquitous in bovines (Hause et al., 2013 (Hause et al., , 2014 Ferguson et al., 2015) . These results, in addition to the common detection and isolation of IDV from bovines with acute respiratory disease, led to the proposal of cattle as the reservoir for IDV (Hause et al., 2014) . Besides swine, humans and bovines, IDV antibodies have also been detected in goats and sheep but were absent from poultry (Quast et al., 2015) .",

The amount of IDV RNA in samples from animals with BRD was also significantly greater than IDV-positive asymptomatic animals. (P = 0.04).

Numerous commercial vaccines variably consisting of combinations of inactivated and modified live bacteria and viruses are widely used; however, the incidence of BRD has been increasing for the past several decades (USDA, 2011). The etiology of BRD involves interactions between the host, environment and pathogens (Mosier, 2014) . Dogma posits that animal stress, often due to movement and animal management, predisposes cattle to a primary viral insult followed by secondary bacterial pneumonia due to commensal or exogenous pathogens. A number of viruses have established roles in BRD pathogenesis, including bovine viral diarrhea virus (Ridpath, 2010) , bovine herpesvirus 1 (Muylkens et al., 2007) , bovine respiratory syncytial virus (Gershwin et al., 2000) , bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (Ellis, 2010) , bovine rhinitis virus (Mohanty et al., 1969; Betts et al., 1971) , and most recently, IDV (Ferguson et al., 2016) . Commercial vaccines for the latter virus are not available however, likely in part due to its recent discovery and our developing understanding of its role in BRD pathogenesis. Here we show that an inactivated IDV vaccine provides partial protection to disease caused by a homologous challenge. Significant reductions in viral titers in nasal swabs and tracheal swabs and BALF were all observed, as well as the number of animals positive for antigen in nasal turbinate and tracheal tissues.",

            "text": "This study expands upon an earlier IDV pathogenesis and transmission study performed in a small number of calves. Similar to that work, IDV replication was limited to the upper respiratory tract and the main pathology observed was rhinitis and tracheitis in this study. Ferguson et al. showed that IDV causes mild respiratory disease with the highest viral titers present in the nasal turbinates, decreasing in tissues lower in the respiratory tract. While we also measured high (>5 TCID 50 /mL) titers in the turbinates and trachea, similar titers were determined in BALF. Surprisingly, only two calves were weakly positive for IDV by IHC on lung tissue. We suspect that virus identified in BALF is largely a result of virus deposition due to the large volume of mucous and exudate observed in the upper respiratory tract as opposed to significant replication in the lung. Pathology was only seen in the lung in one calf and IDV antigen deposition in the lung of two calves, which demonstrates that this virus, although primarily an upper respiratory tract pathogen, does have the ability to replicate into the lung. This extension into the lung is important to consider in cases of highly stressed cattle that develop BRD. IDV is thought to utilize 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid as a cellular receptor (Hause et al., 2013) . This receptor is also utilized by bovine coronavirus for cellular attachment and challenge studies have shown that BCV can cause lung pathology and be readily detected in lung tissue by IHC (Vlasak et al., 1988; Park et al., 2007) . Factors other than cell receptors may restrict IDV replication mainly to the upper respiratory tract. IDV replication was similarly restricted to the upper respiratory tract in swine and ferrets but in contrast, high lung titers and abundant antigen was detected in guinea pig lungs (Hause et al., 2013; Sreenivasan et al., 2015) . In swine, inactivated influenza A virus vaccines often yield sterilizing immunity to homologous challenge (Vincent et al., 2008) . While significant reductions in viral titers in nasal and tracheal swabs and BALF were observed, in addition to significant reductions in the number of animals positive for IDV by IHC on turbinate and tracheal tissue, viral titers significantly greater than non-challenged controls were observed. The calves used in this study received colostrum at birth and had measurable IDV antibody titers at study commencement (4.7-4.9 log 2 HI titer). While we cannot be certain that these antibodies were maternally derived, previous work found that 94% of neonatal beef cattle were seropositive for IDV (Ferguson et al., 2015) and our prescreening of these calves >1 month before study enrollment showed they were negative for IDV by PCR. As maternal antibodies are known to interfere with vaccination and the development of active immunity, the presence of antibodies at the time of vaccination may have lessened the immune response to the vaccine (Sandbulte et al., 2014) . For humans, a HI titer of 40 (5.3 log 2 ) is generally considered protective however does not fully alleviate disease symptoms (Memoli et al., 2016) . Two doses of the inactivated vaccine here resulted in HI titers 137-169 (7.1-7.4 log 2 ) which yielded partial protection. Interestingly, the reduction in viral titers was most pronounced in samples collected lower in the respiratory tract (BALF < trachea < turbinates). As inactivated influenza vaccines largely elicit protection through humoral immunity, this result may suggest a greater role for humoral immunity in the lower respiratory tract.",

Although the significant clinical disease caused by IDV was mild, it may be sufficient to allow infiltration and colonization of bacteria to both the upper and lower respiratory tract (Ferguson et al., 2016) . Future studies are needed to test this hypothesis. Additionally, an inactivated IDV vaccine was moderately protective to a homologous challenge. Inclusion of IDV into commercial BRD vaccines may improve their efficacy in preventing BRD. While several studies have failed to find evidence of widespread IDV infections in humans (Hause et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2016) , a recent study found that 97% of humans occupationally exposed to cattle were serologically positive to IDV by microneutralization in contrast to 18% of non-exposed humans (White et al., 2016) . While it is unknown whether infection of humans with IDV causes disease, vaccination of cattle could help limit zoonosis.",
