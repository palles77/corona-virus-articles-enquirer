A substantial proportion of the global burden of acute lower respiratory infections is attributable to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus especially in children and the elderly. However, limited information is available on the burden of acute respiratory infections in the Eastern Mediterranean Region of the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean has been collaborating with the Influenza Division of International Program of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since 2006 to enhance influenza surveillance in the Region. The goal of this collaboration has been to enable the 22 countries of the Region to collect good quality surveillance data on influenza and influenza-associated illnesses in a timely and reliable manner, use these data to improve understanding of the burden, seasonality and risk factors of influenza in the Region, and use such evidence to introduce control measures such as influenza vaccines to reduce the incidence of severe disease and death attributed to influenza. This successful collaboration has led to substantial improvements in influenza surveillance in the Region and the use of data for public health [3] .",

The network was established in partnership with the CDC, US Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3) and the WHO Regional Office. Over the following five years, surveillance efforts expanded to include collaborations with other ministries of health in the Region [4] .
