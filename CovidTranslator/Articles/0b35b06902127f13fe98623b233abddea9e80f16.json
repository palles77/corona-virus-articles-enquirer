            "text": "Organization-approved real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR), involving 239 acute-phase throat swab samples, demonstrated exceptionally higher sensitivity by picking up all of the 116 H1N1-positive cases and 36 additional positive cases among the negatives that were sequence-confirmed as S-OIV H1N1. None of the real-time RTPCR-positive samples were missed by the RTLAMP system. The comparative analysis revealed that S-OIV RTLAMP was up to tenfold more sensitive than the World Health Organization real-time RTPCR; it had a detection limit of 0.1 tissue culture infectious dosage of 50 /ml. One of the most attractive features of this isothermal gene amplification assay is that it seems to have an advantage in monitoring gene am-plification by means of SYBR Green I dye-mediated naked-eye visualization within 30 minutes compared to 2 to 3 hours for a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. This suggests that the RT-LAMP assay is a valuable tool for rapid, real-time detection and quantification of S-OIV in acute-phase throat swab samples without requiring sophisticated equipment. ( The recent emergence of the swine-origin influenza A H1N1 virus (S-OIV), which has a high efficiency of human-to-human transmission, raised concern about a global pandemic. The 2009 swine flu pandemic was caused by a novel S-OIV that had not been previously recognized in pigs or humans. 1 This newly emerged virus is a quadruple reassortment of two swine strains, one human strain, and one avian strain of influenza viruses. The largest proportion of genes comes from swine influenza viruses (30.6% from North American swine influenza strains, 17.5% from Eurasian swine influenza strains), followed by North American avian influenza strains (34.4%) and human influenza strains (17.5%). 2 Pigs play an important role in interspecies transmission of the influenza virus. Susceptible pig cells possess receptors for both avian (\u2423 2-3-linked sialic acids) and human influenza strains (\u2423 2-6-linked sialic acids), which allow for the reassortment of influenza virus genes from different species if a pig cell is infected with more than one strain. 3 The S-OIV has caused a considerable number of deaths within a short time since its emergence.",

            "text": "A confirmed case of pandemic H1N1 influenza A can be made through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) or culture. The recommended test to confirm the diagnosis of pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus is real-time RTPCR for influenza A, B, H1, and H3. Isolation of pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus using culture is diagnostic, but culture is usually too slow to help guide clinical management. 5, 6 A negative viral culture does not exclude infection by H1N1 influenza A. Clinicians may consider using rapid influenza antigen tests as part of their evaluation of patients suspected of having pandemic H1N1 influenza A, but results should be interpreted with caution. 7, 8 A large number of RTPCR tests have been reported, and they use various chemical and multiplexing formats. 9 -16 However, in the current scenario, the only realtime RTPCR validated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is the one approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for confirmation of pandemic novel swineorigin H1N1 infection. This CDC real-time RTPCR is based on a panel of oligonucleotide primers and duallabeled hydrolysis probes that use the Superscript TM III Platinum one-step quantitative kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) with four sets of primers and probes for universal influenza A, swine influenza A, swine H1(new H1N1), and housekeeping gene (RNase P) for testing the quality of the RNA template (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/ publications/swine flu/CDC real-time RTPCR protocol). One of the limitations of the existing WHO-approved CDC real-time RTPCR is that the test system is very expensive, considering the large number of primer and probe sets that must be used. In addition, the requirement of expensive real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instruments also restricts the system's application to a few referral laboratories that have good financial resources. Overall, the real-time RTPCR test system is expensive and time consuming-it requires 3 to 4 hours. Therefore, real-time RTPCR is not the method of choice in basic clinical settings in developing countries for clinical diagnosis of novel S-OIV. It is critical to develop simple and economical molecular tests that can be used in field conditions, especially at peripheral health care settings, as a routine test that does not require sophisticated instruments.",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal gene amplification (LAMP) is a novel nucleic acid amplification method developed by the Eiken Chemical Company in Tokyo, Japan. It has the potential to replace the PCR because of its simplicity, rapidity, specificity, and cost-effectiveness. 17 The reverse transcription LAMP (RTLAMP) assay is a simple diagnostic tool in which the reaction is carried out in a single tube by mixing the buffer, primers, reverse transcriptase, and DNA polymerase and incubating the mixture at 63\u00b0C for 30 minutes. Compared to RTPCR and real-time PCR, RTLAMP has the advantages of reaction simplicity and detection sensitivity. 18, 19 The LAMP assay has emerged as a powerful gene amplification tool for the rapid identification of microbial infections and is being increasingly used by various investigators for the rapid detection and typing of emerging viruses, such as West Nile, severe acute respiratory syndrome, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya, and so forth. 20 -25 In the present study, we report the development of a one-step, real-time RTLAMP assay for rapid and real-time detection of novel S-OIV RNA in clinical specimens by targeting the HA gene. The particular importance is the substantial reduction in the time required for the confirmation of results: 30 minutes as opposed 2 to 3 hours in real time RT-PCR. The S-OIV H1 gene-specific RTLAMP assay reported in this study was found to be a simple, rapid, reliable, and inexpensive method for the detection as well as the identification of novel S-OIV without requiring any sophisticated instruments or fluorescent probes. The data concerning the sensitivity and specificity of the method is discussed, and the applicability of RTLAMP technology to clinical diagnosis of patients with swine flu is validated by evaluation by acute-phase throat swab samples collected from the ongoing epidemic in India.",

The two outer primers were described as the forward outer primer (F3) and the backward outer primer (B3). The inner primers were described as the forward inner primer (FIP) and the backward inner primer (BIP). Further, two loop primers, forward loop primer (FLP) and backward loop primer (BLP), were designed to accelerate the amplification reaction. The usefulness of the selected primer set for correctly identifying all strains and isolates of S-OIV was established through sequence alignment of all available HA gene sequences in the GenBank, including the circulating strains responsible for the recent pandemic in India, using DNASIS software (MiraiBio, Yokohama, Japan). In addition, the homology study was used to ensure the maximum number of mismatched nucleotides between pandemic S-OIV sequences and seasonal flu (InfA), including other respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, para influenza, adeno virus, and so forth, so as to avoid crossamplification. The details of the primer sequences with regard to genome position are depicted in Table 1 .",

Various investigators have reported several formats for real-time RTPCR, but none of those assays were validated by a defined sample panel. Therefore, the WHO approved only the CDC-recommended realtime RTPCR assay for confirmation of infection by pandemic S-OIV H1N1 influenza. However, the existing WHO-approved, CDC real-time RTPCR system has several limitations, including the high cost because of the use of large number of primer and probe sets. One of the major limitations of the WHO-approved, CDC real-time RTPCR is the requirement of an expensive real-time PCR instrument that can be afforded only by referral laboratories with good financial resources. Still another limitation of the real-time RTPCR test system is that it is time consuming, requiring 3 to 4 hours. In addition, the limitation of all PCR methods is that falsenegative results may occur because of sequence variations in primer and probe targets, and that is particularly relevant for the detection of emerging viruses. However, the use of multiple targets can reduce such limitations and may serve as a means of confirming positive results.",

This is an alternative real-time test system for rapid detection and for identification of novel S-OIV H1N1 viruses. The assay is based on a simple isothermal geneamplification tool using a specially designed primer set that specifically amplifies the H1 gene of novel S-OIV only. Unlike PCRs, in which the target gene is flanked by two primers, in the case of LAMP, a set of six primers flanks a small target of approximately 200 bp through recognition of eight different sequences of the target gene. LAMP is therefore selective and target specific. Unless all of the eight different sequences are identified, the amplification will not proceed. 17 Therefore, a sequence homology of 95% or higher is required for LAMP. The in-silico specificity testing of S-OIV H1 RTLAMP primer set revealed more than 98% to 99% homology among the circulating S-OINV strains, including the California/Paris/China/Singapore/Indian strains. However, the homology between S-OIV and InfA strains in swine H1N1 strains was below 90%. Further analysis of other respiratory viruses, such as respiratory synctial, adeno, para influenza, and so forth revealed less than 50% homology. The in-silco analysis of the S-OIV H1 RTLAMP primer set clearly indicates that the designed primer set is highly specific for the S-OIV H1N1 virus strain only.",

            "text": "The comparative evaluation of CDC real-time RTPCR that includes a reasonably good number of samples revealed 100% concordance for picking up positive cases. Overall, S-OIV RTLAMP picked up some additional positive cases that were being missed by WHO-CDC real- time RTPCR and that were found to be true-positives following sequencing. The presence of the discrepantadditional positive samples is attributed to the higher sensitivity of S-OIV RTLAMP, as already indicated through comparative analytical sensitivity tests for limit of detection. The lower sensitivity of WHO-CDC real-time RTPCR has been reported by Ellis et al. 16 in 2009 in their comparative study that evaluated various H1N1 primer and probe sets. These discrepant additional positive samples were further confirmed as true positives by using SYBR Green I-based real-time RTPCR as the third test, and nucleotide sequencing is considered a polished gold standard. 26 The higher sensitivity and specificity of the reaction is attributed to the continuous amplification under isothermal conditions and the use of six primers that recognize eight distinct regions of the target. 19 The reproducibility and versatility of the reported S-OIV H1 gene-specific RTLAMP is indicated by the fact that the evaluation is being carried out at three centers and by at least 10 different investigators over a period of three months, using four to five lots of reagents. The quantification of the virus load by the RTLAMP assay can also be a useful marker to assess the therapeutic efficacy of antiviral drug as well as for the quarantine of patients so as to restrict the spread of infection. As indicated by the results, the S-OIV H1 RTLAMP could pick up the borderline cases in which the virus load was in the range of 10 to 1 copy numbers. The fact that most of the patients may have either a high or a low virus load, depicting bimodal distribution, may be attributed to late reporting in most cases because all three of the testing centers are being designated referral laboratories for H1N1 testing. One of the most attractive features of this isothermal gene amplification assay seems to be its great advantage in terms of monitoring the amplification that can be accomplished by SYBR Green I dye-mediated nakedeye visualization. The assay is rapid and cost-effective because gene amplification can be accomplished in a heating block/water bath and followed by the naked eye as it monitors the visual fluorescence in the form of color change. These simple attributes of the assay make it favorable for adoption as a field gene-amplification technology without requiring any expensive instruments. The method is simple and obviates the need for expensive equipment such as real-time PCR instruments, which cost $40,000 to $50,000. The better appreciation of apple-green fluorescence can be achieved by using a simple UV hand-held torch. The test is rapid; results can be obtained in 60 minutes as compared to the 3 to 4 hours required by conventional gene amplification assays. The method is highly sensitive and specific and can detect low copy number of viruses, especially in the borderline cases that would be missed by conventional RT-PCR techniques. These findings suggest that the S-OIV H1 gene-specific RTLAMP assay is a valuable tool for rapid, real-time detection as well as for quantification of the H1N1 virus in acute-phase throat-swab samples. It requires no sophisticated equipment, so it is useful for clinical diagnosis in developing countries.",
