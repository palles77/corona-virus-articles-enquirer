Common causes of the disease includes pseudorabies virus (PRV), influenza viruses and the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), the latter being first detected in different European countries in 1983-1984 (Brown et al., 1986; Duret et al., 1988; Pensaert et al., 1986) . Serological studies have demonstrated a close relationship between PRCV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) with the viruses being distinguished from each other only by the use of monoclonal antibodies (Laude et al., 1988; Garwes et al., 1988) . Recently, Rasschaert et al. (1990) compared the genomic organization of each virus and showed that PRCV had various nucleotide deletions when compared to TGEV. No conclusion could be made concerning the genomic modification (s) controlling the phenotypic difference observed between the viruses, namely the impaired multiplication of PRCV in the digestive tract. Until now, great attention has been given to clinical disorders induced by PRCV in the field (Jestin et al., 1987; Brown and Cartwright, 1986) and under experimental conditions (Vannier, 1990; Pensaert et al., 1986; O'Toole et al., 1989) , but nothing is known about excretion and airborne transmission of the virus. In order to better understand that aspect of the epidemiology of PRCV, we studied excretion of the virus in pigs experimentally infected with the virus.",
