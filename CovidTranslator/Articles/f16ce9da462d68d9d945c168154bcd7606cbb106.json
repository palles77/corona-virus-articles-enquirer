The influence of host cells on polykaryocyte formation was studied by infecting Vero and BHK-21 cells with IV4454 strain (moi 1), as both cellular types produced similar amounts of extracellular virus at 24 h p.i. (data not shown). In contrast to the high percentage of fused cells observed on Vero cells, a reduced fusion activity was detected on BHK-21 cells. In addition low levels of GP38 expression was observed at 24h and 48 h in BHK-21 cells (Table 1) . A similar threshold of pH for viral fusion activity was observed when syncytium assay was done by infecting Vero cells with different JV strains (Fig. 3) . In all cases, no cell fusion was detected in cultures treated with medium at pH values over 5.5. In addition, the increase in fusion activity as the pH was lowered was similar to that previously shown in Fig. 1 .",

A fusion protein is defined as an integral membrane protein that, upon trigger, changes conformation so as to expose an hydrophobic domain that promotes mixing of lipid components from two bilayers. Recently, a model of cell fusion has proposed that a protein-facilitated pore is a common theme for viral and cellular fusion [18, 29] . We found that neutralizing antibodies reactive against GP38 inhibited syncytium production ( Table 2) , providing evidence that the external glycoprotein play a role in the fusion process. Though the mechanism of neutralization of infectivity by these antibodies remain to be determined, it is possible that their binding to GP38 prevent viral spike conformational changes, which are usually required for fusion activity. Even if neu, tralizing antibodies (Table 2 ) may interfere with the receptor binding it has been shown that viral fusion reactions can take place with membranes that lack receptor [6, 13, 29] .",

Recently, conformational changes in the structure of the LCMV-glycoprotein complex following exposure to acidic pH, have been described [7] . In fact, structural reorganization of the viral spike which may represent priming for fusion event has also been reported for SFV, Sindbis, influenza and HIV-1 [1, 11, 20, 26] .",

Results are expressed as percentage of fused cells from cultures incubated at 37 \u00b0C ([B), 25 \u00b0C (ll) or 4 \u00b0C (.) and number of nuclei per polykaryocyte counted from cultures incubated at 37 \u00b0C (A) or 25 \u00b0C (A). B JV infected Vero cells were incubated at 24h p.i. in MEM buffered at pH 5.0 (i) or 7.0 (2) and stained with Giemsa; 3 uninfected Vero cells, x 250 Effect of moi on the rate of fusion induced at low pH. IV4454-infected cells were exposed for various times to acid medium (pH 5.0) at 24h p.i.. Then cells were washed, incubated in MM (15h) and fixed. The extent of fusion was expressed as percentage of fused cells infected at moi 1 and treated in acid medium for 180 rain. A similar moi dependence was observed for GP38 expression at the cell surface. The percentage of fluorescent cells at 24 h p.i. increased from 0.5% at moi 0.1 to 5.2% at moi 0.5 and 11.5% at moi 1.",
