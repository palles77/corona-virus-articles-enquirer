            "text": "Recent advances in molecular cytogenetics (see Chapter 1, section A), including gene microarray techniques, have been and currently are being applied to investigations of chromosomal aberrations in dogs with lymphoma. [10] [11] [12] Breen's group has documented gain of canine chromosomes 13 and 31 and loss of chromosome 14 as the most common aberrations in a group of 25 cases analyzed. 11 The recent publication of the canine genome and the commercial availability of canine gene microarrays (e.g., GeneChip Canine Genome 2.0 array; Affymetrix Santa Clara, California) certainly will lead to advances in our understanding of the genetic events in lymphoma in the very near future. 13 Several genetic predispositions have been reported for a pedigree of bull mastiffs, 14 a group of related otter hounds, a family of rottweilers, and a breeding pair of unrelated Scottish terriers. 15 Germ line and somatic genetic mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene (see Chapter 2) and the N-ras gene have been documented in bull mastiffs and in a dog with lymphoma, respectively. [16] [17] [18] In addition, differences in the prevalence of immunophenotypic subtypes of lymphoma among different breeds have been shown to indicate heritable risks. 19,19b Epigenetic modifications also have been investigated in dogs with lymphoma; deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) hypomethylation (see Chapter 1, section A) was a feature of neoplastic cells in most lymphoma cases and in one third of the leukemia cases investigated and likely is involved in malignant transformation of lymphoid cells. 20 ",

Chromosomal aberrations are nonrandom in human lymphoma, and several aberrations serve as markers for various subtypes of lymphoma. In addition, several oncogenes that may play a role in the pathogenesis of lymphoma have been detected based on the identification of cytogenetic abnormalities. [21] [22] [23] Chromosomal aberrations also have been reported in canine lymphoma. [10] [11] [12] 24 A study of 61 dogs with lymphoma demonstrated a treatment advantage in dogs with trisomy of chromosome 13 (25% of the dogs studied), as evidenced by an increase in duration of the first remission and overall survival time. 24 As our knowledge of molecular events and tumorigenesis has expanded, several molecular aberrations have been implicated in various canine tumor types, and some associated with lymphoma have been identified. Altered oncogene/tumor suppressor gene expression, epigenetic changes, signal transduction, and death-pathway alterations are common in human lymphomas and likely are also involved in the dog. As mentioned earlier, N-ras and p53 aberrations, although rare in dogs, have been implicated in some dogs with lymphoma. [16] [17] [18] [25] [26] [27] Telomerase activity (see Chapter 14, section D) also has been documented in canine lymphoma tissues. [28] [29] [30] Alterations in cellular death-pathways, particularly the Bcl-2 family of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic governing molecules, have been implicated in human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 31 and currently are under investigation in canine lymphoma.",

The results of this study since have drawn criticism, and three follow-up investigations have not validated the assertion of increased risk. [43] [44] [45] In another study, dogs exposed to lawn treatment within 7 days of application were more than 50 times more likely to have urine levels of 2,4-D of 50 \u00b5g/L or higher. 46 The highest concentration was noted 2 days after application. In a study of 28 dogs with lymphoma, the tumors of 20 dogs with known exposure to 2,4-D were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology for cellular N-ras oncogene mutations. 47 The ras genes influence cell proliferation and may induce differentiation through signal transduction pathways. Mutation in the ras genes results in ras proteins that promote cell growth. One dog in the series showed a mutation of N-ras, indicating that such mutations are uncommon in canine lymphoma, a finding similar to that for humans with lymphoma. 47 In an environmental case control study performed in Europe, two variables, residency in industrial areas and use of chemicals (defined as paints or solvents) by owners, modestly increased the risk of lymphoma; however, no link was found between the use of pesticides and risk. 48 A weak association between lymphoma in dogs and exposure to strong magnetic fields was observed in a preliminary epidemiologic study. 49 In this hospital-based, case control study, dogs categorized as having high or very high exposure had an increased risk of lymphoma (odds ratio, 1.8). More thorough studies are necessary to evaluate this association further.",

In humans the tumor usually is composed of \u03b3\u03b4T cells (i.e., T cells that express the \u03b3\u03b4T-cell receptor), and this immunophenotype has been confirmed in at least one dog in the veterinary literature.

The clinical relevance of this system is likely to be high; however, it awaits further investigation. More recently, the Oncology Committee of the American College of Veterinary Pathologists (ACVP) has established a Lymphoma Subcommittee to formulate a classification system for lymphoma that has clinical relevance. The subcommittee has obtained information from an international group of veterinary oncologists and pathologists, and its report is expected to be completed by 2008.",

            "text": "The Working Formulation (WF) was developed to allow investigators to \"translate\" among the numerous classification systems so that clinical trials could be compared in humans. Most of the larger compilations agree that most canine lymphomas are intermediate or high grade; however, diffuse immunoblastic forms appear to predominate in the United States, whereas the follicular large cell variations predominate in Europe. A comparison of European and American classifications is warranted based on this discrepancy. The WF categorizes tumors according to pattern (diffuse or follicular) and cell type (e.g., small cleaved cell, large cell, immunoblastic), but it does not include information about the immunophenotype of the tumor. 103 The WF subtypes are related to the biology of the tumor and patient survival. The updated Kiel classification includes the architectural pattern, morphology (centroblastic, centrocytic, or immunoblastic), and immunophenotype (B cell or T cell) of the tumor cells. 102 In both systems, the tumors then can be categorized as low-grade, intermediate-grade, or high-grade malignancies. Low-grade lymphomas composed of small cells with a low mitotic rate typically progress slowly and are associated with long survival times but are incurable. High-grade lymphomas with a high mitotic rate progress rapidly but are more likely to respond to chemotherapy and, in humans, are potentially curable. Several features of canine lymphomas become apparent when the WF or updated Kiel classification is applied. The most striking difference between canine and human lymphomas is the scarcity of follicular lymphomas in the dog. [108] [109] [110] [111] Some diffuse lymphomas in the dog initially may be follicular, but these may progress to the more aggressive, diffuse form by the time of diagnostic biopsy. Only a small percentage of canine lymphomas (5.3% to 29%) are considered lowgrade tumors. 60, 104, 105, 112 Most low-grade small cell lymphomas are T cell in origin. 105 High-grade lymphomas occur frequently if the diffuse large cell lymphomas, classified as intermediategrade in the WF, are considered high-grade, as in the updated Kiel classification (in which they are labeled diffuse centroblastic lymphomas). Canine lymphoblastic lymphomas are uncommon. 72, 104 Most high-grade lymphomas are of B-cell origin. 105 However, a documented difference exists in the prevalence of the various lymphoma immunophenotypes based on breed. 19 For example, cocker spaniels and Doberman pinschers are more likely to develop B-cell lymphoma, boxers are more likely to have T-cell lymphoma, and golden retrievers appear to have an equal likelihood of B-and T-cell tumors.",

            "text": "To be clinically useful, these classification systems in the end must yield information about response to therapy, maintenance of remission, and survival. Some studies suggest that the subtypes in the WF can be correlated with survival, and the Kiel system may be useful for predicting relapse. 113, 114 In most studies, high-grade lymphomas show a complete response to chemotherapy significantly more often than low-grade tumors. However, dogs with low-grade tumors may live a long time without aggressive chemotherapy. Dogs with T-cell lymphomas have shown a lower rate of complete response to chemotherapy and shorter remission and survival times than dogs with B-cell tumors. 60, 75, 112, 113 Furthermore, T-cell lymphomas tend to be associated with hypercalcemia. [115] [116] [117] In the veterinary literature, 60% to 80% of lymphoma cases in dogs are B-cell lymphoma; T-cell lymphomas account for 10% to 38%; mixed B-and T-cell disease accounts for as many as 22%; and null cell tumors (i.e., neither B-cell nor T-cell immunoreactive) represent fewer than 5%.* The development of monoclonal antibodies to detect specific markers on canine lymphocytes has made immunophenotyping of tumors in dogs routinely available in many commercial laboratories. Such techniques also can be performed on paraffin-embedded samples and on cytologic specimens obtained by fine-needle aspiration. [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] The Rappaport classification system, proposed in 1956 for human NHL, described the architectural pattern (follicular or diffuse) and the cytologic features (well differentiated, poorly differentiated, or histiocytic) of the tumors. 99, 123 The term histiocytic was applied to tumors in which most of the lymphocytes had larger diameters, more vesicular nuclei, and more prominent nucleoli than those of lymphocytic or undifferentiated lymphomas; it also was used because the malignant cells have some morphologic features of benign histiocytes. However, immunophenotyping has failed to document a biologic relationship between these cells and true histiocytes, therefore the term now is largely considered a misnomer. Furthermore, this subgroup of histiocytic lymphomas included tumors with different morphologic and immunophenotypic features. The Rappaport classification has not been useful in providing prognostic information or in guiding therapy in dogs with lymphoma because of the low number of follicular tumors in dogs, the problematic \"histiocytic\" subgroup, and the failure to account for different morphologic and immunologic cell types. 100 One criticism of these classification systems is that they fail to include extranodal lymphomas as a separate category. Although differences between nodal and extranodal tumors in biologic behavior and prognosis are well recognized, comparative information about the histogenesis of these tumors has been lacking. For example, in humans, small cell lymphomas arising from MALT are composed of cells with a different immunophenotype from that of other small cell lymphomas (i.e., MALT lymphomas typically are negative for both CD5 and CD10). 124-126 Except for cutaneous lymphoid neoplasms, detailed characterization of extranodal lymphomas in dogs has not been done. Although cutaneous lymphoma is a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that includes an epitheliotropic form resembling mycosis fungoides and a nonepitheliotropic form, most cutaneous lymphomas have a T-cell phenotype. 85, 127 To summarize, it is important to determine the histologic grade of canine lymphomas as low (small lymphocytic or centrocytic lymphomas) or intermediate to high (diffuse large cell, centroblastic, and immunoblastic lymphomas). Furthermore, determining the immunophenotype of the tumor provides useful information. Response rates to chemotherapy are better in animals with B-cell tumors and intermediate-to highgrade lymphomas. Dogs with low-grade lymphomas can have long survival times without aggressive therapy.",

Care should be taken to avoid lymph nodes from reactive areas (e.g., mandibular lymph nodes); the prescapular or popliteal lymph nodes are preferable. Also, lymphoid cells are fragile, and in preparing smears of aspirated material, only gentle pressure should be applied in spreading the material on the slides. In most cases, a diagnosis of lymphoma can be made on evaluation of fine-needle aspirates of affected lymph nodes or other tissues. Typically, most of the cells are large lymphoid cells (larger than neutrophils), and they may have visible nucleoli and basophilic cytoplasm ( Figure 31-7 , A) or fine chromatin with indistinct nucleoli. Because tissue architecture is not maintained in cytologic specimens, effacement of the lymph node or capsular disruption cannot be detected. Therefore, marked reactive hyperplasia characterized by increased numbers of large lymphoid cells may be difficult to distinguish from lymphoma, and small cell lymphomas may have few cytologic clues that point to their malignancy. Also, classification of lymphoma into the subcategories that comprise the low-, intermediate-, and high-grade forms, which has been attempted using the cytologic appearance and immunophenotypic analysis, 153 is performed most accurately on histologic sections.",

            "text": "Part IV \u2022 Specific Malignancies in the Small Animal Patient Immunophenotyping typically is used to determine the type of cells that make up the lymphoma, but sometimes the technique is helpful for making the diagnosis of lymphoma. When a diverse population of lymphocytes is expected in a tissue, the presence of a homogeneous population of the same immunophenotype is supportive of a neoplastic process. The immunophenotype of a lymphocyte is identified by determining the expression of molecules specific for B cells (e.g., CD79a) and T cells (e.g., CD3). Although tumor cells sometimes have morphologic characteristics that typify a particular immunophenotype, exceptions occur, and morphology cannot be used as the sole determinant of the type of lymphocyte. For example, in a series of nine high-grade T-cell lymphomas and leukemias in dogs, the cells had a plasmacytoid appearance, typically associated with B-cell lymphoma. 171 Similarly, anatomic location does not always predict the immunophenotype. In a series of 44 cases of gastrointestinal lymphoma in dogs, often considered a neoplasm of B cells, the neoplastic cells were identified as T cells (CD3 positivity) in 75% of the cases. 70 For accurate determination of the immunophenotype, antibodies against lymphocyte markers are applied to tissue sections (immunohistochemistry), cytologic specimens (immunocytochemistry), or individual cells in a fluid medium (flow cytometry). Flow cytometric evaluation of cells from needle aspirates also is feasible. 172 For T cells, markers include CD3 (pan T), CD4 (helper T), and CD8 (cytotoxic T); for B cells, the markers are CD79a (see Figure 31 -7, B) and CD21. 173 Interestingly, aberrant expression of CD molecules has been reported in canine lymphoma. In a study of 59 dogs with lymphoma, tumor cells from six dogs were positive for both T-and B-cell CD markers; however, a clonality assay (discussed later) revealed clonality for either the T-cell or the immunoglobulin receptor but not both. This indicates that in some cases of B-and T-cell lymphoma, the malignant cells may coexpress B-and T-cell CD markers. 119 Antibodies against these molecules are used to determine the immunophenotype; however, they also have a potential use as a therapeutic modality if tumor cells could be targeted using these antibodies.",

In these cases, advanced molecular analyses are necessary to help confirm a diagnosis. Clonality is the hallmark of malignancy; that is, the malignant cell population theoretically should be derived from expansion of a single malignant clone characterized by a particular DNA region unique to that tumor. For example, in a dog with T-cell lymphoma, all the malignant cells should have the same DNA sequence for the variable region of the T-cell receptor (TCR) gene; likewise, in a dog with B-cell lymphoma, the tumor cells should have identical DNA sequences in the variable region of the immunoglobulin receptor gene. Conversely, in reactive lymphocytosis, the cells are polyclonal for their antigen receptors. Using this knowledge, investigators have used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) PCR techniques to amplify the variable regions of the T-cell and immunoglobulin receptor genes to detect clonal lymphocyte populations in dogs ( Figure 31-8) .

The middle two lanes represent two different reactions that amplify immunoglobulin CDR3, and the fourth lane shows TCR\u03b3 CDR3 amplification. The samples are separated on a polyacrylamide gel. A, Lymph node aspirate from a normal dog. B, Lymph node aspirate from a dog with histologically confirmed multicentric B-cell lymphoma. C, Lymph node aspirate from a dog with histologically confirmed T-cell lymphoma. (From Avery PR, Avery AC: Vet Clin Pathol 33:196-207, 2004.) In physician-based medicine, such assays of clonality are approximately 70% to 90% sensitive and have a false positive rate of approximately 5%, and recent studies report similar rates in the dog. 169 False negative and false positive results can occur with clonality assays. For example, cells from a dog with lymphoma may be negative for clonality if the clonal segment of DNA is not detected with the primers used, if the malignant cells are natural killer (NK) cells (rare), or if the malignant cells are present in too low a frequency to be detected. 169 False positive results occur rarely with some infectious diseases, such as ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease. In these cases a diagnosis should be made only after the results of all the diagnostic tests are considered, including histologic and cytologic evaluation, immunophenotyping, and clonality studies, in conjunction with the signalment and physical findings. Molecular techniques, in addition to aiding the diagnosis, could also be useful in determining early recurrence, more accurate clinical staging, and so-called molecular remission rates, because they are more sensitive than standard cytologic assessment for the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes.",

The WHO staging system routinely used to stage dogs with lymphoma is presented in Box 31-1. Most dogs (more than 80%) are presented in advanced stages (stage III or IV). Some type of imaging and an assessment of bone marrow involvement may be indicated for staging. The degree to which thorough staging is implemented depends on three factors: whether the result will alter the treatment plan; whether relevant prognostic information will be gleamed; and whether the client needs to know. In addition, when different protocols are compared with respect to efficacy, consistent and similar staging systems should be used to avoid so-called stage migration, which results when one staging methodology is more accurate than another. 178 The effect of stage migration currently is being evaluated in veterinary patients with lymphoma, and until the concept has been thoroughly explored, the impact on the prognosis should be considered when different published outcomes are compared.",

It is important to remember that these cells also can be seen with GI parasitism, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, and other immune-mediated diseases. Recently, circulating tumor cells in dogs with stage III lymphoma were identified using a clonality assay (PARR). 168 The assay is more sensitive than routine microscopy in detecting malignant cells in circulation, but the correlation of these results with staging and prognosis has not been determined.

[61] [62] [63] [64] Craniomediastinal lymphadenopathy is detected in 20% of dogs with lymphoma. 63 Abdominal radiographs reveal evidence of sublumbar (iliac) and/or mesenteric lymph node, spleen, or liver involvement in approximately 50% of cases. 63, 64 In the authors' practice, in typical cases of canine multicentric lymphoma, imaging is limited to thoracic radiographs because no prognostic difference exists between dogs with stage III disease and those with stage IV disease (i.e., liver or spleen involvement); however, the presence of craniomediastinal lymphadenopathy is prognostically significant (see Prognosis later in this section). If clinical signs attributable to abdominal disease are present, further imaging of the abdomen is warranted.

CHOP represents combinations of cyclophosphamide (C), doxorubicin (represented by the H, for hydroxydaunorubicin), vincristine (O, Oncovin) and prednisone (P). Conventional chemotherapy induces complete remission (CR) in approximately 60% to 90% of dogs, with median survival times of 6 to 12 months depending on the protocol used. Approximately 20% to 25% of dogs live 2 years or longer after initiation of these protocols (Figure 31-9) . Response rates and the duration of response vary according to the presence or absence of prognostic factors discussed in the Prognosis section. The cost to the owner depends on the drug or drugs selected, the size of the animal, the frequency of administration, and the laboratory tests needed to monitor toxicity.",

Long-term maintenance chemotherapy has been shown to be ineffective in humans with Hodgkin's disease, NHL, and multiple myeloma. However, the initial induction course of chemotherapy in humans is much more aggressive than that used in veterinary patients. Although no randomized studies have been performed to address the therapeutic benefit of long-term maintenance chemotherapy in dogs, comparisons of dogs treated with CHOP-based protocols in which all treatment was stopped after 6 months of induction therapy 129 were compared with sequentially treated, historical controls that received a nearly identical protocol that included long-term maintenance therapy. 60 The dogs that received the shortened, less expensive, no-maintenance protocol had comparable remission and survival durations and were more likely to achieve second remissions when they relapsed after completion of chemotherapy than their counterparts that received long-term maintenance therapy. Other studies, although not prospective randomized trials, suggest that aggressive induction or discontinuous therapy (i.e., induction without maintenance) is as good as or superior to protocols that use an extended maintenance phase. 190, 193, 194, 200 These data, taken together, suggest that maintenance therapy is not necessary and indeed may be inappropriate for dogs with lymphoma that are treated with similar combination chemotherapy protocols.",

            "text": "Providing precise treatment recommendations for the wide variety of clinical settings of dogs with lymphoma is difficult, especially in light of the plethora of published combination drug protocols (see Table 31 -3). Because of the large and ever increasing number of protocols available, several factors should be considered and discussed with caregivers on a case-by-case basis in making the choice of protocol. These factors include the cost, time commitment, efficacy, toxicity, and experience of the clinician with the protocols in question. With the increased availability of generic drugs, protocols are becoming affordable to a larger segment of veterinary clients. In general, more complex combination chemotherapy protocols are more expensive, more time-consuming (i.e., requiring repeated office visits and closer monitoring), and more likely to result in toxicity than simpler, single agent protocols. However, as a general rule, more complex combination protocols result in longer remission and survival durations than single agent protocols. The earliest treatment protocol used in veterinary patients was a non-doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy (i.e., cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone [CVP]), a relatively simple, easy protocol that is well-tolerated and results in a 60% to 70% CR rate and a median survival time of 6 to 7 months. 187,188 However, it has been clearly established that the standard of care combination protocols used in dogs with lymphoma include doxorubicin, and all are essentially variations on the CHOP protocols previously discussed and listed in Table 31 -3. Although many of these CHOP protocols include L-asparaginase, which is added either at initiation or at varying times throughout the protocol, several studies have confirmed that the addition of L-asparaginase in induction protocols does not result in clinically relevant increases in remission rate, speed of attaining remission, or first-remission duration; therefore its use is best reserved for rescue situations (discussed later). 128,190,219,220 Regardless of the veterinary CHOP-based combination protocol used, they all generally result in an 80% to 90% CR rate with median survival times of 12 months. About 25% of dogs are long-term survivors (longer than 2 years), and some are cured. The CHOP protocol used by the authors at the time of publication (Box 31-3) generally is well tolerated by dogs. This protocol does not have a maintenance therapy arm, and all treatments stop at 19 weeks if the animal is in complete remission.",

The expected complete response rate will range from 50% to 75% with an anticipated median survival time of 6 to 8 months. 128, 188, 189, 197 If financial or other client concerns preclude the use of more aggressive systemic chemotherapy, prednisone therapy alone (2 mg/kg given orally daily) often results in a short-lived remission of approximately 1 to 2 months. In these cases, it is important to inform clients that should they decide to pursue more aggressive therapy later, dogs with previous prednisone therapy are more likely to develop multiple drug resistance (MDR) while receiving single agent prednisone and to have shorter remission and survival durations with subsequent combination protocols. This is especially true after long-term prednisone therapy and in dogs that have experienced a recurrence while receiving prednisone. 195,221 Therefore, the earlier a client opts for more aggressive therapy, the more likely it is that a durable response will result. A CBC should be performed before each chemotherapy treatment. A neutrophil count of at least 2000/ml and a platelet count of 50,000/ml should be present before the chemotherapeutic drugs are administered. If the neutrophil count is below 2000/ml, it is best to wait 5 to 7 days and repeat the CBC. If the count has risen above 2000 cells/ml, the drug can be safely administered. A caveat to these restrictions: In dogs presented before initiation of chemotherapy that have low neutrophil and platelet counts because of bone marrow effacement, myelosuppressive chemotherapy is instituted in the face of cytopenias to \"open\" the bone marrow and allow counts to normalize.",

Fractionated radiation therapy (to a total dose of 30 to 45 Gy) has been associated with long-term control. 80 Diffuse non-T-cell lymphoma is best managed with combination chemotherapy, although the response rate is less than in multicentric lymphoma. In one study, investigators reported that combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine (Oncovin), cytosine arabinoside, and prednisone (COAP) induced longterm remission in some cases. 249 Five of six dogs with diffuse non-T-cell cutaneous lymphoma attained a complete or partial remission, with a median remission duration of longer than 250 days and a median survival of longer than 399 days. 249 Retinoids, such as isotretinoin (Accutane) and etretinate (Tegison), have been used successfully in canine and human T-cell cutaneous lymphoma. 82, 250 In one study, 12 dogs with cutaneous lymphoma were treated with isotretinoin (3 to 4 mg/kg given orally daily), and two were treated with etretinate (1.25 to 1.45 mg/kg given orally daily, continuously). Eleven of these 14 dogs had T-cell cutaneous lymphoma, and six of the 14 dogs achieved remission. In another study, four dogs with T-cell lymphoma were treated successfully with isotretinoin for 13, 11, 10, and 5 months. 82 In the authors' experience, retinoid treatment must be given for at least 2 months to note a response. Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-L-asparaginase (30 mg/kg given intramuscularly weekly) induces responses in dogs with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, although remissions are not durable, and no cures have been noted. 251 Prednisone may also be necessary to control pruritus. In the authors' experience, pegylated-liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) has produced remissions in approximately 40% of cases. Although most of these were short-lived responses, remissions of 1 year or longer occasionally have occurred.",

            "text": "The histologic grade (subtype) has been found to influence the prognosis in some studies; however, our ability to predict outcome based on subtype is still quite limited. Dogs with lymphoma classified as intermediate-or high-grade (large cell, centroblastic, and immunoblastic) tend to respond to chemotherapy but can relapse early. Dogs with low-grade lymphomas (small lymphocytic or centrocytic) have a lower response rate to chemotherapy, yet have a survival advantage over dogs with intermediate-or high-grade lymphomas ( Figure 31 -10) in that the course of disease may be more indolent. 113 Using the Working Formulation, dogs with low-grade lymphomas have a survival advantage compared to dogs with intermediate-or high-grade tumors. 78 Recently, proliferative assays (e.g., analysis of bromodeoxyuridine [BrdU] uptake, Ki-67 antibody reactivity, and AgNOR indices) to measure the proliferative activity of tumor cells have been shown to provide significant prognostic information in dogs treated with combination chemotherapy. 60, 163, 254, [258] [259] [260] However, the results of different studies are contradictory. In two trials, dogs that had tumors with short doubling times, high AgNOR frequencies, or high Ki-67 immunoreactivity had a better prognosis than dogs with long doubling times or low AgNOR frequencies. 60, 163 In other trials, the low-proliferating tumor groups were associated with a better prognosis. 254, 259 In one trial, the proportion of tumor cells undergoing apoptosis was modestly predictive of remission duration. 163 The anatomic site of disease also has considerable prognostic importance. Primary diffuse cutaneous, diffuse gastrointestinal, hepatosplenic, and primary CNS lymphomas tend to be associated with a poor prognosis. Cutaneous lymphoma tends to progress slowly, and in our experience the responses to systemic chemotherapy are less durable. Localized lymphomas in the skin can be managed with radiation therapy or surgery or both, and these tumors have a better prognosis. In some dogs with lymphoma, significant involvement in the bone marrow may be present (i.e., tumor cells comprise more than 50% of all nucleated cells) and circulating malignant lymphocytes may be present in the peripheral blood. These dogs tend to have an overall poor prognosis. In some cases it is difficult to determine whether the disease arises from the bone marrow (e.g., acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]) or is a diffuse lymphoma with extensive involvement in the marrow. Immunophenotyping is helpful in these cases, because the tumor cells in ALL typically are CD34 positive.",

Retroviruses have been implicated in diverse animal species such as cats, cattle, fish, snakes, birds, rodents, and nonhuman primates. A retroviral cause in dogs has not been proved. However, a retrovirus with morphology typical of lentiviruses has been isolated from mononuclear cells obtained from the peripheral blood of a dog with ALL. 270 In humans, acute leukemia has been associated with exposure to radiation, benzene, phenylbutazone, and antineoplastic agents. [271] [272] [273] [274] [275] [276] The alkylating agents can cause chromosomal damage and are clearly carcinogenic. 276 Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a proven cause of leukemia in a large cohort of human patients from the southern islands of Japan. 277,278 The etiology of CLL is less clear, but genetic factors likely are important. Extrapolation of predisposing factors across species is not warranted, and the etiologic factors for dogs may be quite different from those for humans, given the difference in the predominant immunophenotype of the neoplastic cells (discussed later).",

Infiltration of the spleen and liver is common, and extramedullary sites (e.g., the nervous system, bone, and GI tract) also may be involved. Some animals may have lymph node involvement and develop generalized lymphadenopathy. 265 The lymphocytes of CLL are virtually indistinguishable morphologically from normal small lymphocytes, and they have a low proliferation rate. The accumulation of lymphocytes likely results from their prolonged life span. In B-cell CLL, the marrow is infiltrated with mature lymphocytes, and the extent of infiltration is less than that seen with ALL or MPD. The neoplastic cells in GL T-cell CLL originate in the spleen, and bone marrow involvement may or may not occur. 173 Dogs with CLL tend to have a mild anemia, and granulocytes and platelets are only mildly reduced. Splenomegaly is common, and lymph nodes can be slightly to moderately enlarged. 269 Despite the well-differentiated appearance of the lymphocytes in CLL, these cells may function abnormally.

In one study of 22 dogs with CLL, 68% had monoclonal gammopathies. 269 The immunophenotypes were not reported, but a monoclonal gammopathy is associated with production of immunoglobulins by the leukemic cells (B cells). The immunoglobulin is usually IgM or IgA. The term macrogammaglobulinemia is used to describe IgM gammopathy (see Chapter 31, section D). Dogs with CLL and an IgM monoclonal gammopathy are said to have Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia. Dogs can also develop hyperviscosity syndrome (see Chapter 31, section D).",

A knowledge of the profile of lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of normal dogs is helpful for determining whether a particular subset has expanded.

In the T-cell fraction, helper T cells (CD4+) outnumber cytotoxic T cells (CD8+). 173 Lymphocytic leukemia should be a consideration if atypical lymphocytes are in circulation, if the immunophenotype of the lymphocytes in circulation is homogenous, or if a phenotype typically present in low numbers has increased. Differential diagnoses for lymphocytosis include certain infectious diseases (e.g., chronic ehrlichiosis), postvaccinal responses in young dogs, IL-2 administration, and transient physiologic or epinephrine-induced lymphocytosis. Reactive and neoplastic lymphocytoses sometimes are difficult to differentiate. In these cases, PCR assays are used to determine the clonality of the T cell or immunoglobulin receptor genes in a population of lymphocytes (see earlier discussion). 167, 169, 268 Infiltration of the bone marrow by neoplastic lymphoid cells is the hallmark of ALL and is seen in most cases of CLL; careful examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow by experienced cytopathologists is essential for establishing a diagnosis of lymphocytic leukemia. If adequate diagnostic bone marrow cannot be obtained by aspiration, a bone marrow core biopsy should be performed. In ALL, lymphoblasts predominate in the bone marrow and also are present in peripheral blood.

Nucleoli, although present, are less prominent in lymphoblasts than in myeloblasts. Nevertheless, these cells cannot be easily distinguished from blast cells of other hematopoietic lineages, and lineage-specific markers on the cells must be identified by immunocytochemistry or flow cytometry. 278 The most frequently used markers are CD3 for T cells and CD79a for B cells. As mentioned earlier, CD34 is found on blast cells of both lymphoid and myeloid lineages, and positivity for CD34 helps to confirm leukemia of immature cells (acute leukemia) and to distinguish ALL from stage V lymphoma. Immature and differentiating lymphocytes may stain strongly for alkaline phosphatase activity, which suggests that this cytochemical staining procedure is not specific for myeloid leukemia. 278, 280, 281 In B-cell and non-GL T-cell CLL, the lymphocytes are small mature cells ( Figure 31-11 , B) that appear in excessive numbers in bone marrow (30% or more of all nucleated cells) early in the disease. 269 Infiltration becomes more extensive as the disease slowly progresses, and eventually the neoplastic cells replace normal marrow. The lymphoid lineage of the cells in CLL typically is easy to identify, and immunophenotyping is done to determine the lymphocyte subset. In dogs, most cases of CLL are T-cell (CD3+) proliferations. In GL CLL, the neoplastic cells originate in the spleen. 173 A separate clinical staging system has not been developed for lymphocytic leukemia. Currently, all dogs with leukemia are classified as stage V based on the WHO staging system for lymphoma (see Box 31-1).

            "text": "Because of the indolent nature of CLL in many animals, the question of whether all dogs with the disease should be treated is controversial. 283,284 Most oncologists recommend observation over active therapy when the discovery of CLL is incidental, when no physical or clinical signs are present, and when no significant hematologic abnormalities are identified. Therapy should be instituted if the animal is anemic or thrombocytopenic, is showing evidence of significant lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, or has an excessively high WBC count (over 60,000 lymphocytes/ml) (Box 31-4). The most effective drug evaluated thus far is chlorambucil. 269 Chlorambucil is administered at a dosage of 0.2 mg/kg or 6 mg/m 2 given orally once daily for 7 to 14 days. The dosage then can be reduced to 0.1 mg/kg or 3 mg/m 2 given orally once daily. For long-term maintenance, a dosage of 2 mg/m 2 given orally every other day can be used. The dosage is adjusted according to the clinical response and bone marrow tolerance. Chlorambucil should be administered without food to increase the rate of absorption. 285 Corticosteroids are lymphocytolytic and lead to cell death by apoptosis. Studies in humans have shown that the antitumor activity of chlorambucil combined with prednisone is better than that of chlorambucil alone. 286 When the bone marrow is heavily infiltrated with CLL cells, and neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occur, use of a more aggressive alkylating agent (usually cyclophosphamide [250 mg/m 2 given once]) when initiating oral chlorambucil and prednisone therapy can be considered to increase the speed of initial remission; however, this modification of the protocol has not been scrutinized in clinical trials. If chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide fails, the choice of treatment is combination chemotherapy similar to that presented in Box 31-3. The treatment of CLL is primarily palliative, and complete remissions are rare. Because of the indolent nature of this disease, however, survival times have been in the range of 1 to 3 years with a good quality of life. 269, 284 In humans, splenectomy has been shown to increase survival significantly in individuals with aggressive forms of CLL; however, splenectomy in dogs with CLL has not been evaluated. 287 The phenotypic expression of CLL usually is stable over months to years. However, the disease may evolve into an acute phase, and some dogs develop a rapidly progressive, pleomorphic (immunoblast) lymphoma. 269 In humans, this is called Richter's syndrome. 288 The prognosis for response to treatment is poor for this form.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Several studies have documented the potential molecular means by which FeLV can result in lymphoid neoplasia. 8, 9 However, over the past 20 years in North America, a profound change has occurred in the viral status, presentation, signalment, and frequency of anatomic sites in cats with lymphoma, as documented by two large studies of feline lymphoma involving more than 700 cats. 10, 11 The change in the epidemiology and characteristics of lymphoma in cats appears to coincide with the widespread integration of clinically relevant FeLV diagnostic assays (indirect immunofluorescence assay) and the affected animal elimination regimens of the late 1970s; it was further enhanced by the appearance of commercially available FeLV vaccines in the late 1980s. The decline in FeLV-associated lymphoma was mirrored by a decline in the overall prevalence per year of FeLV positivity in cats tested, as characterized by reports from the Tufts Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory from 1989 to 1997 10,12 and by Louwerens' group, 11 which reported a decline in FeLV association in more than 500 cases of lymphoma in cats brought to the University of California-Davis Veterinary Teaching hospital.

            "text": "As might be expected, along with a shift away from FeLV antigen-associated tumors came a shift away from the traditional signalment and relative frequency of anatomic sites. 10, 11 This observation is supported outside North America by the similar signalment and anatomic frequency data obtained in Australia, where FeLV infection is quite rare. [17] [18] [19] [20] The median age of approximately 11 years now reported in North America for lymphoma in cats is considerably higher than the median age of 4 to 6 years reported during the FeLV era. 1,3-6,10,11,21 The median age of cats within various anatomic tumor groupings has not changed, and anatomic forms traditionally associated with FeLV, such as the mediastinal form, still occur in younger, FeLV-antigenemic cats. Similarly, the alimentary form occurs most often in older, FeLV-negative cats. 10, 11, [18] [19] [20] Table 31 -6 presents an overview of the characteristics of the various anatomic sites of lymphoma in cats. Younger cats with lymphoma tend to be FeLV antigenemic and are more likely to have mediastinal or multicentric lymphoma. Most cats with spinal lymphoma (85% to 90%) also are FeLV antigenemic. 22, 23 Older cats usually are FeLV negative and develop alimentary lymphoma. 10, 17, 19, 20, [24] [25] [26] [27] In a large compilation of Australian cases, male cats and the Siamese/oriental breeds were overrepresented. 17 Similar breed findings have been observed in North America, 11 but similar gender findings have not emerged. 28, 29 The Siamese/oriental breeds appear to have a predisposition for the mediastinal form that affects a younger population (median age, 2 years). 11 Evidence also indicates that feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection can increase the incidence of lymphoma in cats. [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] In contrast to FeLV, which plays a direct role in tumorigenesis, FIV appears to have an indirect role, likely secondary to the immunosuppressive affects of the virus. 35 Shelton and colleagues 30 determined that FIV infection alone in cats was associated with a fivefold increased risk for the development of lymphomas. Coinfection with FeLV further potentiates the development of lymphoproliferative disorders. Experimentally, cats infected with FIV have developed lymphoma in the kidney, alimentary tract, and liver and in multicentric sites. FIV-associated lymphoma is more likely to have a B-cell immunophenotype whereas T-cell type is predominantly associated with FeLV. 32, 33, 35, 36, [38] [39] [40] [41] Some have suggested that FIV infection may be associated more often with alimentary lymphoma of B-cell origin, 40, 41 which may be related to chronic dysregulation of the immune system or activation of oncogenic pathways. However, in another large compilation of cases, FIV antigenemia only rarely was associated with alimentary lymphoma. 10, [24] [25] [26] [27] Genetic and molecular factors As discussed in Chapter 31, section A, recent advances in molecular cytogenetics (see Chapter 1, section A), including gene microarray techniques, are being used in investigations of chromosomal aberrations in veterinary species with lymphoma. The previously mentioned predisposition of the oriental cat breeds to the development of lymphoma suggests a genetic predisposition and indicates heritable risks. 11, 17 As our knowledge of molecular events and tumorigenesis has expanded, several molecular aberrations have been implicated in various feline tumor types, and some associated with lymphoma have been identified. Altered oncogene/tumor suppressor gene expression, epigenetic changes, signal transduction, and deathpathway alterations are common in human lymphomas and likely are also involved in the cat. N-ras aberrations, although rare in cats, have been implicated. 42 Telomerase activity (see Chapter 14, section D) also has been documented in feline lymphoma tissues. 43, 44 Other factors implicated in feline lymphoma include alterations in cellular proliferation and in cell cycle and death (apoptosis) pathways, particularly the cyclindependent kinase cell cycle regulators and the Bcl-2 family of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic governing molecules, which have been implicated in human NHL. 45, 46 Environmental factors Evidence that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is a risk factor for lymphoma in humans has prompted investigations in cats. In one report, cats with any exposure to ETS had a relative risk of developing lymphoma of 2.4; the relative risk for cats with 5 or more years of exposure was 3.2. 47",

Some discrepancies in the discussion of frequency inevitably will result from the variations in classification used in the literature. The relative frequency of anatomic forms and the immunophenotype may vary with geographic distribution and may be related to genetic and FeLV strain differences, as well as to the prevalence of FeLV vaccine use (see Table 31 -6).",

Approximately two thirds to three fourths of reported cases are of the B-cell immunophenotype. Most patients are older cats, and very few cases appear to be associated with FeLV antigenemia. 10, 11, 18, [24] [25] [26] [57] [58] [59] However, some discordance on these points is seen in the literature. In one smaller report, most alimentary cases sampled were found to be of the T-cell immunophenotype. 24 The population size was relatively small in comparison and may represent a geographic variation. The epitheliotropic form of intestinal lymphoma also has been reported to be more commonly T-cell in origin. 49, 57 A Canadian group investigated formalin-fixed archival lymphoma tissue in cats and found a nearly even distribution between the B-cell and T-cell immunophenotype; they also found that approximately two thirds of the samples were FeLV positive by PCR techniques. 2,60-62 Some FeLV-negative tumors may be derived from transformation of multipotent lymphoid or monocyte precursors 61 or FIV-transformed B lymphocytes. 32, 33, 38, 39 The most common site of involvement in the alimentary tract is the small intestine (50% to 80% of cases), followed by the stomach (approximately 25%), ileocecocolic junction, and colon. 25, 26, 62 The tumor can be solitary or diffuse throughout the intestines (Figure 31-13) , muscle layers, and intestinal submucosa, resulting in annular thickening that leads to partial or complete intestinal obstruction.

The cell population shows an admixture of histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and immunoblasts and occasionally effaced lymphoid follicles. The lymph nodes regress spontaneously in most of these cats. The histologic changes noted in these lymph nodes resemble the histologic features of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphadenopathy in humans. 72 In another report, benign lymphadenopathy in cats was associated with argyrophilic intracellular bacteria. 75 ",

[83] [84] [85] [86] Bone involvement is rarely seen radiographically. 87 Multiple cord regions and the brain are involved in nearly 50% of cats with spinal lymphoma, and more than 80% of these patients have other organ (e.g., renal) and bone marrow involvement. 20, 21, 83 Only one third of cases of intracranial lymphoma are primary and confined to the CNS, and all cats tested have been FIV negative. 84 Cutaneous lymphoma generally is primary but can be seen secondary to multicentric involvement. It commonly is seen in older cats (median age, 10 to 12 years) and gender sex or breed predominance has not been found. [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] Although patients usually are FeLV negative, one case report using PCR techniques found evidence of FeLV provirus in tumor DNA. 92 Cutaneous lymphoma can be solitary or generalized. Two forms of cutaneous lymphoma have been distinguished histologically and immunohistochemically. [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] In most species, the epitheliotropic form, sometimes referred to as mycosis fungoides, is composed of T lymphocytes, whereas the nonepitheliotropic form usually is composed of B lymphocytes. In contrast, one report of nonepitheliotropic cutaneous lymphoma in cats found that five of six cases were of T-cell derivation. 93 Neoplastic T lymphocytes are large and have abundant cytoplasm and convoluted nuclei (mycosis cells). They usually form intraepidermal nests of five to 10 cells, which are separated from surrounding keratinocytes by a clear space (Pautrier's microabscesses). The B-cell lymphomas show lymphocytes deep in the epidermis, with sparing of the papillary dermis and epidermis. A recent report described 23 cases of cutaneous lymphocytosis, an uncommon disease histologically resembling well-differentiated lymphoma. 94 Solitary lesions were most common, and all were composed primarily of T-cells, although two thirds had some B-cell aggregates. Cutaneous lymphocytosis was characterized as a slowly progressive disorder, but internal organ infiltration developed in a few cases.",

Similarly, in a large group of cases compiled in Australia (n = 118), 90% of the cases were mediumto high-grade disease as classified by the WF. 18 Also as discussed earlier in the chapter, WHO has published a histologic classification scheme that uses the revised European American lymphoma (REAL) system as a basis for defining histologic categories of hematopoietic tumors of domestic animals. 100 This system incorporates both histologic criteria and immunohistologic criteria (B-and T-cell immunophenotype).

[101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] These lesions are granulated, round cell tumors that also have been called either globule leukocyte tumors or large granular lymphocyte lymphoma, although they probably are variations of the same disease. Large granular lymphocytes are characterized by abundant cytoplasm with prominent azurophilic granules. This population of cells includes NK cells and cytotoxic T cells. Several reports have identified their immunophenotype as CD3, CD57-like, perforin positive, and CD20 negative; these cells also have been described as having a T-cell receptor gene rearrangement. These tumors commonly originate in the small intestine, especially the jejunum or mesenteric lymph nodes; however, most cases show widespread metastasis to the lung, myocardium, salivary gland, and spinal cord. Leukemia also has been reported with this disease. Affected cats generally are FeLV negative. Large granular lymphocytes must be differentiated from several other granular cell types that may be found in the small intestine, including enterochromaffin cells, mast cells, and eosinophils.",

            "text": "The alimentary form is most commonly associated with an abdominal mass that originates in the GI tract. The condition often is associated with enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes or other organ involvement. In 50% to 85% of cases, a palpable abdominal mass or thickened bowel loops are present. 24, 25, 27, 62, 111 Clinical signs may consist of weight loss, anorexia, diarrhea, and occasional vomiting. In approximately half of cases, the only historical finding is anorexia and weight loss. 25 Other reported presentations include abdominal distention, splenomegaly, persistent thrombocytopenia, and pica. Hematochezia and tenesmus may be present if the lymphoma involves the colon. 27 Polyuria and polydipsia have been reported in approximately 10% of cases. 62 In a small percentage of cases, the patient may have signs consistent with an acute abdomen as a result of intestinal perforation and concurrent peritonitis. 24 Clinical signs of the mediastinal form of lymphoma include dyspnea, tachypnea, and a noncompressible anterior mediastinum with dull heart and lung sounds. 20, [111] [112] [113] [114] In rare cases, Horner's syndrome may be present as a result of involvement of the sympathetic nerve as it ascends around the first rib, and edema of the head may be caused by pressure on the cranial vena cava. 111 Pleural effusion is common; the pleural fluid is characterized by serohemorrhagic to chylous effusion, and in most cases neoplastic cells (lymphoblasts) are identified. 65, 114 Cats with the nodal form of lymphoma have variable clinical signs, depending on the location and extent of disease; however, these cats often are depressed and lethargic. Peripheral lymphadenopathy as the only physical finding is a very uncommon presentation for cats. As stated earlier, an uncommon and distinct form of nodal lymphoma in cats is Hodgkin's-like lymphoma. This form typically involves a single mandibular or cervical node, and the cat usually does not have any overt clinical signs. 54, 70 In cats, unlike in dogs, peripheral lymphadenopathy without organomegaly is more often hyperplastic or reactive and does not represent lymphoma. 73 The extranodal sites include the kidneys, skin, eyes, nasal area, and CNS. Renal lymphoma is most consistently bilateral, even in cats that appear to have unilateral disease. 76 In general, the kidneys are uniformly enlarged; however, they may also feel lumpy and irregular on palpation. More than 50% cats have signs consistent with renal insufficiency. 76 Cats with CNS lymphoma most often have signs associated with thoracolumbar involvement. 22, 23 The most common sites are between the second thoracic and fourth lumbar vertebrae. Signs include gradual or sudden onset of weakness, upper motor neuron paralysis to the bladder, tail flaccidity, hyperpathia in the region of the lesion, and progressing ataxia. The neurologic dysfunction may be insidious or may progress rapidly. 23 Cats with cervical spinal cord or nerve root involvement generally show peracute tetraparesis and diminished sensation in the thoracic limbs. Those with cervical root involvement may show root lesions (root signature), such as lameness and hyperesthesia upon shoulder extension. Common presenting signs for intracranial lymphoma, in decreasing order of frequency, include anorexia, ataxia, lethargy, altered consciousness, and aggression. 84 Cats with nasal lymphoma usually have signs localized to the nasal passage. In a large compilation of cases, the presenting complaints, in decreasing order of frequency, were unilateral nasal discharge (bilateral is less common), facial deformity, dyspnea, and epistaxis. 79-81 Stertor, anorexia, epiphora, exophthalmia, sneezing, and regional lymphadenopathy also can occur.",

Bone marrow aspiration or biopsy may be indicated to evaluate for possible involvement and complete staging of the extent of disease. Bone marrow evaluation is particularly indicated if anemia, cellular atypia, and leukopenia are present. Histopathologic evaluation of lymph nodes or involved organ tissue (procured by means of surgical incision, endoscopy, or needle core biopsy) is essential for a definitive diagnosis. In the cat, lymph node fine-needle aspiration alone is not sufficient in most cases because of the difficulty involved in distinguishing lymphoma from benign hyperplastic lymph node syndromes unique to the species; these include idiopathic peripheral lymphadenopathy, plexiform vascularization of lymph nodes, and peripheral lymph node hyperplasia of young cats. [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] Whole lymph node excision is preferred in these cases, because determination of the orientation, invasiveness, and architectural abnormalities may be necessary for diagnosis. Additional site-specific cytologic or histologic assessments may be warranted when extranodal sites are suspected.",

Elevated liver enzymes may indicate hepatic infiltration with lymphoma, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels may indicate renal lymphoma. For cats with alimentary lymphoma, hypoproteinemia and anemia are reported to occur in up to 23% and 76% of cases, respectively. 25, 118 Hypercalcemia is rare in cats but has been reported in patients with lymphoma at various anatomic sites. 25,66-68 Elevated globulin levels may indicate the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy with or without serum hyperviscosity (this is a rarely reported paraneoplastic syndrome in cats with lymphoma). 119,120 Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately one third of cats with lymphoma in an Australian study. 118 Serum alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentrations have been reported to be elevated in cats with lymphoma, but no clinical relevance has been associated with this finding. 121 Most cats with alimentary lymphoma develop a palpable abdominal mass or thickened intestinal loops. Approximately one third of patients have a mass that can be visualized on abdominal radiographs, and about 90% have ultrasound abnormalities. 24, 25 The ultrasound abnormalities may include mesenteric lymphadenopathy in 33% to 50% of cases, an intestinal mass or thickening in approximately 40% of cases, and possibly splenomegaly (approximately 33% of cats with ultrasonographic changes in the spleen have lymphoma 122 ), hepatomegaly, or effusion. 24, 25 In one compilation of 28 cases, the lesions appeared ultrasonographically to be localized in 70% of cases and diffuse in 30%; however, at surgery only 33% were resectable. 25 For alimentary lymphoma, especially if primary GI lymphoma is suspected, caution must be exercised when endoscopically obtained tissue is used because of the difficulty in differentiating lymphoplasmacytic gastroenteritis from primary, diffuse, intestinal lymphoma. 123 However, diagnosis of this disease by means of endoscopically derived biopsies is improving with more advanced techniques and instrumentation. A wedge biopsy through serosa and muscularis, avoiding the mucosa, may be necessary to establish a diagnosis in cases in which endoscopic samples are equivocal. As an alternative, because nearly half of alimentary lymphomas have secondary mesenteric lymph node involvement, ultrasound-guided biopsy specimens or fine-needle aspirates may be adequate for a diagnosis.",

Fine-needle aspiration of any suspected mass or cytologic evaluation of pleural fluid may be sufficient to establish a diagnosis. In most cats the finding of a monotonous population of lymphoblasts establishes a diagnosis. 65, 124, 125 However, definitive diagnosis of lymphoma in cats with a mediastinal mass and concurrent chylothorax can be challenging. 114 The CT appearance of these lesions has been 127 In chylous effusions, the pleural fluid triglyceride concentration is greater than in the serum; however, anorectic cats have lower triglyceride levels in the pleural fluid. A major differential diagnosis for mediastinal lymphoma is thymoma. The cytologic features of thymoma were recently described, and although these were found to be distinct from lymphoma in many cases, the diagnosis was challenging because of a preponderance of small lymphocytes in thymoma. 128 Mast cells can also be seen in up to 50% of aspirate samples from thymomas. Diagnostics for most extranodal forms of lymphoma are site specific. In cats suspected of having spinal lymphoma, survey radiographs of the spine rarely reveal osseous lesions. Myelograms, CT, or MRI is indicated, and in approximately 75% of cases, an extradural or intradural mass is detected. 22, 23, 83, 84 Most lesions occur at a thoracolumbar or lumbosacral location. 83 Fluoroscopic-guided, fine-needle aspiration of epidural lesions may yield enough tissue for a cytologic diagnosis. In most of the cats evaluated in one study, CSF analysis revealed a clear, colorless fluid with a mixed pleocytosis (mean, 140 cells/\u00b5l; range, 0 to 1625 cells/Ul) and an elevated protein content (mean, 140.7 mg/dl; range, 12 to 405 mg/dl). 23 Malignant lymphocytes were identified in six of 17 cats evaluated with CSF analysis. In a report of intracranial neoplasia, one of two cats with lymphoma had lymphoblasts in the CSF fluid. 84 Bone marrow and renal involvement are common in cats suspected of having CNS lymphoma, and cytologic assessment of these organs generally is easier than in spinal sites. If nasal lymphoma is suspected, a biopsy specimen can be obtained either by intranasal procurement or by flushing one hemicavity with a bulb syringe and saline while occluding the contralateral cavity and collecting samples flushed out the nasopharynx (Figure 31-15 ). Thorough staging to make sure that the disease is confined to the nasal passages is recommended, because this presentation can be treated locally with radiotherapy if systemic involvement is ruled out. A CT scan is indicated to determine local involvement and to plan radiotherapy if it is to be pursued. For cutaneous lymphoma, punch biopsies (4 to 8 mm) should be taken from the most representative and infiltrative sites, although overtly infected skin lesions should be avoided.",

The disease usually is diffuse throughout the renal cortex ( Figure 31-16, B) , and transabdominal needle aspiration or core biopsy is diagnostic in most cases. A WHO staging system exists for the cat that is similar to the one used in the dog (see Box 31-1). However, because of the high incidence of visceral involvement in the feline species, another staging system is used more often (Box 31-5). 21 Because lymphoma in cats is more varied with respect to location and anatomic types, staging systems generally are less helpful for predicting response.",

In these cases, advanced molecular analyses may be helpful for confirming a diagnosis. Clonality is the hallmark of malignancy; that is, the malignant cell population theoretically is derived from expansion of a single malignant clone. This was discussed earlier in the chapter for lymphoma in the dog (see Section A and Figure 31-8) , and the same assays can be applied for advanced diagnosis of lymphoma in cats. 85 Investigators have used PCR techniques to amplify the variable regions of the T-cell and immunoglobulin receptor genes to detect clonal lymphocyte populations in cats, and these techniques appear to be a useful adjunctive diagnostic tool, although they are undergoing a more thorough assessment. Molecular techniques may also prove useful for assessing early recurrence, for more accurate clinical staging, and for providing so-called molecular remission rates, because they are more sensitive than the standard cytologic assessment of peripheral blood, bone marrow, or lymph nodes.",

The chemotherapeutic agents most often used to treat feline lymphoma are similar to those used for dogs and humans with lymphoma (see Section A); they include doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, L-asparaginase, CCNU, and prednisone.* In general, cats tolerate chemotherapy quite well. Selected published protocols for the treatment of feline lymphoma are detailed in Table 31 -8. Most current combination protocols in North America are modifications of CHOP protocols initially designed for human oncologic use. In Europe, COP (i.e., without the addition of doxorubicin) is used more often in cats with lymphoma, and one compilation reported results similar to those for CHOP. 133 Some studies with relatively few case entries have reported limited activity for doxorubicin as a single agent in cats with lymphoma 19, 132 ; however, larger studies using combination protocols have more consistently reported that the addition of doxorubicin is necessary to attain more durable responses. 10, 129 In European and Australian studies that reported less favorable doxorubicin responses, the patient populations consisted of a higher proportion of the mediastinal form in Siamese cats, a population less frequently included in North American reports. 19, 133 The protocol the authors use in their practice is presented in Table 31 -9. This protocol has been used in many cats with various forms of lymphoma and is well tolerated. Currently, our canine lymphoma protocols (see Section A) discontinue chemotherapy by week 25, and we have sufficient data exist to show that in dogs, this short, maintenance-free protocol is as good as if not superior to longer maintenance protocols. Because long-term maintenance protocols have not proved superior to maintenance-free protocols in dogs and humans with lymphoma, the same likely holds true in the cat, although no data exist to document this. Until such time as evidence to the contrary exists, we recommend discontinuation of chemotherapy at week 25 in cats that have attained complete remission.",

Nutritional support is especially important, particularly for cats with alimentary lymphoma. A feeding tube may need to be placed in cats undergoing chemotherapy for alimentary lymphoma, particularly if anorexia is a factor (see Chapter 16, section B.) Ultimately, most cats with lymphoma that are successfully treated with chemotherapy have a relapse of the disease. This often represents a recrudescence of the tumor in a more drug-resistant form. At the first recurrence, reinduction first should be attempted by using the induction protocol that was successful initially.

The wide variation in frequency and the great heterogeneity of anatomic forms of lymphoma in cats make specific prognostications more difficult than in dogs with lymphoma. Most studies have lumped anatomic groups together to produce remission and survival data, and individual group numbers generally have been too small to apply statistical analysis with meaningful power. That being said, the factors that appear to be most strongly associated with a more positive prognosis in cats are a complete response to therapy (Figure 31-17) , which unfortunately cannot be determined before treatment; negative FeLV status ( Figure 31-18) ; early clinical stage (Figure 31-19) ; anatomic location; and addition of doxorubicin to the treatment protocol. 5,10,24,129 Unlike in the dog, CD3 immunoreactivity has not been established as a negative prognostic factor in the cat. 10 Early reports may contradict more recent studies partly because of the decline in FeLV-associated lymphoma, and patients reported in the early literature may not equate to more recent populations studied.

Cell lineage includes myeloid cells, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, lymphoid cells, megakaryocytes, and erythrocytes. Box 31-6 presents a classification scheme for the leukemias identified in the cat.

Cats with acute leukemia usually show signs of severe anemia (pale mucous membranes), splenomegaly, and febrile episodes.

In cats suspected of having CLL, infiltration of the bone marrow with more than 20% mature lymphocytes helps confirm the diagnosis. All cats with leukemia should be tested for FeLV and FIV.

Severe anemia is common, and the peripheral blood shows numerous nucleated erythrocytes, moderate to marked anisocytosis, and an increased erythrocyte mean cell volume. The bone marrow contains a preponderance of normal-appearing erythrocyte precursors. Some cats undergo blast transformation to myeloblastic, granulocytic, or a poorly differentiated leukemia (previously called reticuloendotheliosis). The transition from erythremic myelosis to erythroleukemia to acute granulocytic leukemia is well recognized in humans. 169 110, 143, 146 Erythroleukemia, or acute erythremic myelosis, can develop from blast transformation of erythremic myelosis. Primitive erythroid precursors in the blood and bone marrow predominant. Primitive cells resembling myeloblasts often are present in low numbers. [170] [171] [172] [173] Primary erythrocytosis is rarely reported in cats, and the diagnosis is based on an elevated PCV (65% to 80%) with low to normal serum erythropoietin activity. Most clinical signs are associated with an increased red blood cell (RBC) volume, which increases blood volume and viscosity, causing impaired blood flow, stasis, and tissue hypoxia. Neurologic signs such as seizures, blindness, and mental depression are common. 172 The oral mucous membranes may appear brick red. It is important to differentiate this condition from secondary polycythemia caused by renal tumors, chronic hypoxia, and right-to-left cardiac shunts.

Cats with primary erythrocytosis that go untreated are reported to survive 6 to 20+ weeks. 170, 172 Phlebotomy alone every 2 to 3 months was used to treat one cat, which survived longer than 20 months. 171 Hydroxyurea treatment for primary erythrocytosis was used in eight cats, and all survived longer than 1 year. 172 Hydroxyurea is available in 500 mg capsules, and the dosage is 25 to 50 mg/kg given orally daily. Some cats have been given 500 mg every 5 to 7 days, but methemoglobulinemia and hemolytic anemia with Heinz bodies has been seen. 172 A better recommendation is to have the drug formulated into 125 mg capsules, which is a more appropriate dosage. However, care must be used in making these capsules because hydroxyurea is potentially carcinogenic. A recommended treatment schedule for hydroxyurea is 125 mg daily to every other day, depending on the type of leukemia under treatment. The drug is tolerated very well at this dosage. A case of acute ML in a cat undergoing treatment with cytarabine, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone has been reported; a partial remission was noted for approximately 2 months, and the cat survived for 3 months after diagnosis. 147 a retrospective study Subcommittee to re-examine criteria for a classification system and to spearhead large multi-institutional studies to validate the criteria.",

These factors act at the level of the committed progenitor cells but also influence the functional capabilities of mature cells. Some of these factors have a broad spectrum of activity; others are more restricted in their target cells and actions. CSFs are produced in vitro by a multitude of cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells, and these cells likely play a role in the production and regulation of these factors in vivo.

A preleukemic syndrome, characterized by peripheral pancytopenia and bone marrow hyperplasia with maturation arrest, is more correctly called myelodysplasia because the syndrome does not always progress to overt leukemia. This syndrome has been described in cats, usually in association with FeLV infection, but it has only rarely been recognized in dogs. [25] [26] [27] [28] MPDs may be manifested by abnormalities in any or all of the different cell lines, because hematopoietic cells share a common stem cell. In addition, transformation from one MPD to another may occur. 29 MPDs are classified in several ways. The terms acute and chronic refer to the degree of cellular differentiation of the leukemic cells, but these terms also correlate with the biologic behavior of the neoplasm. 30 Disorders resulting from uncontrolled proliferation of cells incapable of maturation lead to the accumulation of poorly differentiated, or blast, cells. These disorders have been called acute MPDs or acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, but they now are included under the umbrella term acute myeloid leukemia. Disorders resulting from unregulated proliferation of cells that exhibit progressive, albeit incomplete and defective, maturation lead to the accumulation of differentiated cells. These disorders are called chronic MPDs. They include polycythemia vera, CML and its variants, essential thrombocythemia, and possibly primary myelofibrosis. MPDs are further classified by the lineage of the dominant cell type or types, as defined by Romanowsky stains, special cytochemical stains, ultrastructural features, and immunologic cell markers, and they recently have been classified into subtypes (see later discussion).",

In both acute and chronic disorders, however, abnormalities in proliferation, maturation, and functional characteristics can occur in any hematopoietic cell line. 1 In addition, normal hematopoiesis is adversely affected. Animals with leukemia usually have decreased numbers of circulating normal cells. The pathogenesis of the cytopenias is complex and may result in part from production of inhibitory factors. Eventually, neoplastic cells displace normal hematopoietic cells, a process called myelophthisis. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are particularly common. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia result in infection and hemorrhage, which may be more deleterious to the animal than the primary disease process. Despite the disseminated nature of the disease at the time of diagnosis, parenchymal organ dysfunction usually occurs only in very advanced cases of MPD.",

This results in the accumulation of immature blast cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood (Figure 31-21) . The WBC count varies, ranging from leukopenia to counts greater than 150,000/ml. The spleen, liver, and lymph nodes commonly are involved, and other tissues may be infiltrated as well, including the tonsils, kidneys, heart, and CNS. No characteristic age has been noted, and even very young dogs may be affected. 31 The clinical course of these disorders tends to be rapid. Production of normal peripheral blood cells usually is diminished or absent, and anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia are common. Infection and hemorrhage are common sequelae. Occasionally, malignant blasts are present in the bone marrow but not the peripheral blood; this is called aleukemic leukemia. Subleukemic leukemia suggests a normal or decreased WBC with some neoplastic cells in circulation.",

Recognition of specific subtypes of leukemia is necessary for the accumulation of accurate, useful information about prognosis and response to treatment and for comparison of studies from different sites. In 1991 this group proposed a classification system following adaptation of the French-American-British (FAB) system and criteria established by the National Cancer Institute Workshop. 2 The group members examined blood and bone marrow from 49 dogs and cats with MPDs. Romanowsky-stained specimens were examined first to identify blast cells and their percentages. Lineage specificity then was determined using cytochemical markers. The percentage of blasts and the information about lineage specificity were used in combination to classify disorders as acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML, subtypes M1 to M5 and M7), and erythroleukemia with or without erythroid predominance (subtypes M6 and M6Er) (see Box 31-7).",

Because of the low incidence of MPDs, national and international cooperative efforts are required to accumulate information on the pathogenesis of specific subtypes and their response to different treatment modalities; use of a uniform classification system is an essential first step. Different forms of AML are shown in Figure 31 -21, A-E. The most frequently reported forms of AML in the dog are acute myeloblastic leukemia (M1 and M2) and acute myelomonocytic leukemia (M4). [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] Megakaryoblastic leukemia (M7) also is well recognized in dogs 8, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] and may be associated with platelet dysfunction. 44 Monocytic leukemias likely have included those with and without monocytic differentiation (M5a and M5b), 9, 47 but in some cases the diagnosis may have been chronic myelomonocytic or chronic monocytic leukemia (see later discussion). There are few reports in dogs of spontaneously occurring erythroleukemia (M6) in which the leukemic cells comprise myeloblasts, monoblasts, and erythroid elements. 48, 49 AULs have uncertain lineages, because they are negative for all cytochemical markers. These leukemias should be distinguished from lymphoid leukemias by flow cytometric analysis of the leukemic cells for cellular antigens that identify their lineage. 50 In addition, examination of blast cells by electron microscopy may reveal characteristic ultrastructural features.",

In any case, the result is overproduction of RBCs. The disease is rare and must be distinguished from more common causes of polycythemia, including relative and secondary absolute polycythemia (see later discussion). In PV, neoplastic proliferation of the erythroid series with terminal differentiation to RBCs occurs. The disease has been reported mostly in middle-aged dogs, and no breed or gender predilection has been noted. [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] PV is characterized by an increased RBC mass, evidenced by an elevated PCV, RBC count, and hemoglobin concentration. The PCV typically is in the range of 65% to 85%. The bone marrow is hyperplastic, although the M:E tends to be normal. In contrast to the disease in humans, other cell lines do not appear to be involved, and transformation to other MPDs has not been reported. The disease in dogs may be more appropriately called primary erythrocytosis.",

Pathogenic mechanisms include the effects of inhibitory factors, leading to ineffective hematopoiesis, myelophthisis, immune-mediated anemia secondary to neoplasia, and hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, or DIC. Anemia is most severe in acute MPDs, although both anemia and thrombocytopenia may be milder in animals with the M5 subtype (acute monocytic leukemia). In myelofibrosis, the anemia is characterized by anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. In addition, pancytopenia and leukoerythroblastosis, in which immature erythroid and myeloid cells are in circulation may be present. These phenomena probably result from the replacement of marrow by fibrous tissue, with resultant shearing of red cells and escape of immature cells normally confined to bone marrow.

In bone marrow, blast cells are calculated both as a percentage of all nucleated cells (ANC) and nonerythroid cells (NEC) and are further characterized using cytochemical markers. [84] [85] [86] Neutrophil differentiation is identified by positive staining of blasts for peroxidase, Sudan black B, and chloracetate esterase. Nonspecific esterases (alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase or alphanaphthyl butyrate esterase), especially if inhibited by sodium fluoride, mark monocytes. Canine monocytes may also contain a few peroxidase-positive granules. Acetylcholinesterase is a marker for megakaryocytes in dogs and cats. In addition, positive immunostaining for von Willebrand's factor (factor VIII-related antigen) and platelet glycoproteins on the surface of blasts identifies them as megakaryocyte precursors. 8, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] Alkaline phosphatase (AP) only rarely marks normal cells in dogs and cats but is present in blast cells in acute myeloblastic and myelomonocytic leukemias. However, because of reports of AP activity in lymphoid leukemias in dogs, its specificity as a marker for myeloid cells is not certain. Omega-exonuclease is a specific marker for basophils, which are also positive for chloracetate esterase activity. 69 Blood and bone marrow differential counts and cytochemical staining should be performed and interpreted by experienced veterinary cytopathologists. If erythroid cells comprise less than 50% of ANC and the blast cells account for more than 30%, a diagnosis of AML or AUL is made. If erythroid cells are more than 50% of ANC and the blast cells are more than 30%, a diagnosis of erythroleukemia (M6) is made. If rubriblasts comprise a significant proportion of the blast cells, a diagnosis of M6Er, or erythroleukemia with erythroid predominance, can be made. (It should be noted that in the human AML classification system, the blast threshold has been lowered to 20%.)",

            "text": "Bone marrow erythroid cells CD21, CD45, CD79, and IgG, are available for dogs and can be used to rule out lymphoblastic leukemia in dogs with acute leukemias. 50, 87 Other markers include myeloperoxidase (MPO) and CD11b for myeloid cells and CD41 for megakaryoblasts. Some overlap in the expression of these cell antigens occurs. For example, canine (but not human) granulocytes express CD4. It is best to use a panel of antibodies (similar to using a battery of cytochemical stains), because antigens often are expressed on multiple lineages, and lineage infidelity can occur. These tests have become more valuable with the availability of canine reagents. Currently, the Myeloid Neoplasm Subcommittee of the ACVP Oncology Committee recommends that the following immunophenotyping panel be done on bone marrow and/or blood smears to characterize animal leukemias: for B lymphocytes, CD79a; for T lymphocytes, CD3; for myeloid cells, MPO and CD11b; for megakaryoblasts, CD41; for dendritic cells, CD1c; and for acute leukemias, CD34. 16 Owing to the degree of differentiation of cells in chronic MPDs, these disorders must be distinguished from nonneoplastic causes of increases in these cell types. To allow a diagnosis of PV, tests first must establish that the polycythemia is absolute rather than relative. In relative polycythemias, plasma volume is decreased from hemoconcentration, dehydration, or hypovolemia, and the absolute red cell mass is not increased. Splenic contraction also can result in relative polycythemia. Absolute polycythemia, in which the RBC mass is increased, usually occurs secondary to tissue hypoxia, causing appropriate increased production of erythropoietin. In rare cases, erythropoietin may be produced inappropriately by a tumor (e.g., renal cell carcinoma) or in renal disease (pyelonephritis) or localized renal hypoxia. [88] [89] [90] These causes of polycythemia should be eliminated by appropriate laboratory work, thoracic radiographs, arterial blood gas analysis, and renal ultrasonography. In humans with PV, plasma erythropoietin (Epo) levels are low. Epo levels in dogs with PV tend to be low or low-normal, whereas in animals with secondary absolute polycythemia, the levels are high. 91, 92 Samples for determination of Epo concentrations should be taken before therapeutic phlebotomy to treat hyperviscosity and, owing to fluctuations in Epo levels, should be repeated if results are incongruous with other information.",

            "text": "Basophilic leukemia is diagnosed by finding excessive numbers of basophils in circulation and in bone marrow. Basophilic leukemia must be differentiated from mastocytosis based on the morphology of the cell type present. Basophils have a segmented nucleus and variably sized granules, whereas mast cells have a round to oval nucleus that may be partly or totally obscured by small, round, metachromatic-staining granules. This distinction usually is easy to make; however, in basophilic leukemia, changes in the morphology of the nucleus and granules make the distinction less clear. 68 Essential thrombocythemia has been diagnosed based on finding persistent and excessive thrombocytosis (more than 600,000/ml) without circulating blast cells and in the absence of another MPD (e.g., polycythemia vera), myelofibrosis, or disorders known to cause secondary thrombocytosis. 72 These include iron deficiency anemia, chronic inflammatory diseases, recovery from severe hemorrhage, rebound from immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and absence of a spleen. Thrombocytosis is transient in these disorders or abates with resolution of the primary disease. In essential thrombocythemia, platelet morphology may be abnormal, with bizarre giant forms and abnormal granulation. 73 In the bone marrow, megakaryocytic hyperplasia is a consistent feature, and dysplastic changes may be evident in megakaryocytes. 76 Spurious hyperkalemia may be present in serum samples from dogs with thrombocytosis from any cause because of the release of potassium from platelets during clot formation. 93 Measurement of the potassium in plasma is recommended in these cases and usually demonstrates a potassium concentration within reference interval. Platelet aggregability has been variably reported as impaired 73 or enhanced. 76 In the one dog in which it was measured, the plasma thrombopoietin (Tpo) concentration was normal. 75 Whether Tpo plays a role in essential thrombocythemia or is suppressed by the high platelet mass is unclear. Elucidation of the pathogenesis of this disorder should be aided by the recent cloning of the genes for thrombopoietin and its receptor, the proto-oncogene mpl. 94 In MDS, abnormalities in two or three cell lines usually are manifested in the peripheral blood as neutropenia with or without a left shift, nonregenerative anemia, or thrombocytopenia. Other changes include macrocytosis and metarubricytosis. The bone marrow typically is normocellular or hypercellular with an increased M:E, and blasts cells, although increased, account for fewer than 30% of the nucleated cells.",

Environmental factors known to cause leukemia are exposure to high-dose radiation, benzene (chronic exposure), and alkylating agents. 109 New classification systems have incorporated genetic mutations, more accurately reflect prognoses, and facilitate use of consistent categorization among institutions. 110 Therapeutic modalities under investigation or development include combination chemotherapy, immunotherapy, cytokine therapy, drug-resistance modulators, proapoptotic agents, antiangiogenic factors, signal transduction-active agents, and bone marrow transplantation. The prognosis for chronic MPDs is better than for acute MPDs. For acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, the prognosis is better for children than adults; only 10% of adults who receive chemotherapy maintain remissions for longer than 5 years. 109 The spontaneous canine diseases probably occur too infrequently to serve as useful models. MPDs have been induced experimentally in the dog by irradiation and transplantation in an attempt to create models for study.

Genetic predispositions, molecular aberrations, viral infections, chronic immune stimulation, and exposure to carcinogen stimulation all have been suggested as contributing factors. 4, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Support for a familial association in cats comes from cases reported among siblings. 8 Evidence exists that molecular mechanisms of cellular control, including overexpression of cell cycle control components such as cyclin D1(see Chapter 2) and receptor tyrosine kinase dysregulation, may be involved in canine myeloma and plasma cell tumors. 13, 14 In rodent models, chronic immune stimulation and exposure to implanted silicone gel has been associated with development of MM, 9, 10 as have chronic infections and prolonged hyposensitization therapy in humans. 11 Viral Aleutian disease of mink results in monoclonal gammopathies in a small percentage of cases. 12 Working in the agricultural industry, petroleum products, and irradiation are known risk factors for the development of MM in humans. [15] [16] [17] Progression of solitary plasma cell tumors to MM has been reported in both dogs and cats, and a single case of a B-cell lymphoma that progressed to MM has been reported in the dog. 18, 19 Pathology and Natural Behavior MM is a systemic proliferation of malignant plasma cells or their precursors, which arise as a clone of a single cell that usually involves multiple bone marrow sites. Malignant plasma cells can have a varied appearance on histologic sections and cytologic preparations. The degree of differentiation ranges from cells that resemble normal plasma cells in late stages of differentiation ( Figure 31 -23) to very large, anaplastic round cells with a high mitotic index, representing early stages of differentiation. 3, 4, 7, 20 In cats with MM, most plasma cells (83% in one report) are immature and have marked atypia, including increased size, multiple nuclei, clefted nuclei, anisocytosis, anisokaryosis, variable nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratios, decreased chromatin density, and variable nucleoli. Nearly one fourth of the cells have \"flame cell\" morphology, characterized by peripheral eosinophilic cytoplasmic processes. 7 Malignant plasma cells typically produce an overabundance of a single type or component of immunoglobulin, referred to as the M component ( Figure 31-24) . The M component may be represented by any class of the entire immunoglobulin or by only a portion of the molecule, such as the light chain (Bence Jones protein) or the heavy chain (heavy chain disease). In the dog, the M component usually is represented by either IgG or IgA immunoglobulin types in nearly equal incidence, whereas the ratio of IgG to IgA in cats is approximately 5:1.* If the M component is the IgM type, the term macroglobulinemia (also Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia) often is applied. Several cases of biclonal gammopathy in dogs and cats have been reported. 7, 8, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] Two cases of nonsecretory MM have been reported in dogs. 31 Rarely, cryoglobulinemia has been reported in dogs with MM and IgM macroglobulinemia, and it has been reported in a cat with IgG myeloma. 4, [32] [33] [34] Cryoglobulins are paraproteins that are insoluble at temperatures below 37\u00b0C. They require blood collection and clotting to be performed at 37\u00b0C before serum separation. If whole blood is allowed to clot at temperatures below this, the protein precipitates Part IV \u2022 Specific Malignancies in the Small Animal Patient in the clot and is lost. Pure light-chain M component is rare but has been reported in dogs. 35 The pathology associated with MM is a result of high levels of circulating M component or of organ or bone infiltration with neoplastic cells, or both. Associated pathologic conditions include bone disease, bleeding diathesis, hyperviscosity syndrome, renal disease, hypercalcemia, immunodeficiency (and subsequent susceptibility to infections), cytopenias secondary to myelophthisis, and cardiac failure.",

Approximately one fourth to two thirds of dogs with MM have radiographic evidence of bony lysis or diffuse osteoporosis. 1, 3, 4, 36 Skeletal lesions in cats with MM were rarely reported in the older literature, but more recent reports document lesions in 50% to 65% of cases. [6] [7] [8] 22 Bones engaged in active hematopoiesis are more commonly affected, including the vertebrae, ribs, pelvis, skull, and proximal or distal long bones. 3 Skeletal lesions are rare with IgM (Waldenstrom's) macrogammaglobulinemia, in which malignant cells often infiltrate the spleen, liver, and lymph tissue rather than bone. 4, 33, [37] [38] [39] Bleeding diathesis can result from one or a combination of events. M components may interfere with coagulation by inhibiting platelet aggregation and the release of platelet factor 3; causing adsorption of minor clotting proteins; generating abnormal fibrin polymerization; and producing a functional decrease in calcium. 4, [40] [41] [42] Approximately one third of dogs and one fourth of cats have clinical evidence of hemorrhage. 1, 7, 8 In dogs, nearly half have abnormal prothrombin (PT) and partial thromboplastin (PTT) times. Thrombocytopenia may also play a role if bone marrow infiltration is significant (i.e., myelophthisis).",

            "text": "Hyperviscosity syndrome (HVS) represents one or a constellation of clinicopathologic abnormalities resulting from greatly increased serum viscosity. The magnitude of viscosity changes depends on the type, size, shape, and concentration of the M component in the blood. HVS is more common with IgM macroglobulinemias because of the high molecular weight of this class of immunoglobulin. 37 IgA myelomas, usually present as a dimer in the dog, may undergo polymerization, resulting in increased serum viscosity. 1, 4, 40 IgG-associated HVS also can occur, albeit less frequently. High serum viscosity occurs in approximately 20% of dogs with MM and can result in bleeding diathesis, neurologic signs (e.g., dementia, depression, seizure activity, and coma), ophthalmic abnormalities (e.g., dilated and tortuous retinal vessels, retinal hemorrhage [ Figure 31 -27], and retinal detachment), and increased cardiac workload with the potential for subsequent development of cardiomyopathy.* These consequences are thought to be a result of sludging of blood in small vessels, ineffective delivery of oxygen and nutrients, and coagulation abnormalities. HVS was reported less commonly in cats with MM in the older literature but has been reported in association with IgG-, IgA-, and IgM-secreting tumors. 4, 6, 21, [23] [24] [25] In four of nine cats with MM, the relative serum viscosity was above control ranges. 8 Renal disease is present in approximately one third to one half of dogs with MM, and azotemia was observed *References 1, 4, 37, 39, 40, and 43-45. in one third of cats in one report. 1, 3, 7 The pathogenesis of renal failure often is multifactorial. It can develop as a result of Bence Jones (light-chain) proteinuria, tumor infiltration into renal tissue, hypercalcemia, amyloidosis, diminished perfusion secondary to hyperviscosity syndrome, dehydration, or ascending urinary tract infection. 1, 4, [40] [41] [42] Normally, heavy-chain and light-chain synthesis is well balanced in nonneoplastic immunoglobulin production. In MM, an unbalanced excess of light-chain products may result. 42 Light chains have a low molecular weight and normally are filtered by the renal glomerulus; their presence can result in protein precipitates and subsequent renal tubular injury. The presence of light chains in urine without a concomitant monoclonal spike in serum, although rare, is indicative of pure light-chain disease. 35 Tubules become obstructed by large laminated casts containing albumin, immunoglobulin, and light chains. 4, 35, [40] [41] [42] Bence Jones proteinuria occurs in approximately 25% to 40% of dogs with MM, and in two recent surveys, it occurred in approximately 50% of cases.* Hypercalcemia is reported in 15% to 20 % of dogs with MM and is thought to result primarily from the production of osteoclast-activating factor by neoplastic cells. 1, 4, 46 Other factors have been implicated in human MM, including elevated levels of various cytokines, TNF, IL-1, and IL-6. In two dogs with MM and hypercalcemia, serum elevations in circulating N-terminal PTHrP were noted. 47 Hypercalcemia may also be exacerbated by associated renal disease. Initially thought to be a rare event in cats with MM, hypercalcemia was noted in 25% of recently reported cases. 7, 8, 48 Susceptibility to infection and immunodeficiency long have been associated with MM and often are the ultimate cause of death in affected animals. 1, 4, 22 A B",

In the absence of osteolytic bone lesions, a diagnosis can also be made if marrow plasmacytosis is associated with a progressive increase in the M component. In the cat, because the degree of bone marrow infiltration may not be as marked, some have suggested consideration of plasma cell morphology and visceral organ infiltration in cases with demonstrable M-component disease in the absence of marked marrow plasmacytosis (less than 20%). 7 All animals suspected of having plasma cell tumors should receive a minimal diagnostic evaluation, including a CBC, platelet count, serum biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. Particular attention should be paid to renal function and serum calcium levels. Serum electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis are performed to detect a monoclonal spike (see Figure 31 -24) and to categorize the immunoglobulin class involved. Heat precipitation with electrophoresis of urine is performed to detect Bence Jones proteinuria, because commercial urine dipstick methods are not capable of this determination.",

Skeletal survey radiographs are recommended to detect and determine the extent of osteolytic lesions, which may have diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications. Nuclear scintigraphy (bone scans) for clinical staging of dogs with MM has been performed; however, because of the predominant osteolytic activity with osteoblastic inactivity, these scans seldom give positive results and therefore are not useful for routine diagnosis. 57 In physician-based oncology, bone mineral density analysis (DEXA scan) to document osteoporosis and MRI scans of bone marrow are commonly used for staging; however, neither of these has been applied consistently in the veterinary literature.",

However, several long-term responses (i.e., longer than 1 year) have been reported, and treatment should be attempted when educated clients decide on a therapeutic option. \u2020 Melphalan, an alkylating agent, is the chemotherapeutic drug of choice for the treatment of MM. 1, 4 In the dog, an initial starting dosage of 0.1 mg/kg is given orally once daily for 10 days and then reduced to 0.05 mg/kg given orally once daily continuously. Addition of prednisone therapy is thought to increase the efficacy of melphalan therapy. Prednisone is started at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg given orally once daily for 10 days and is then reduced to 0.5 mg/kg given orally every other day until the drug is discontinued after 60 days of therapy. Melphalan, however, is continued at 0.05 mg/kg/day until clinical relapse occurs or myelosuppression necessitates a dose reduction. Most dogs treated with this melphalan/prednisone combination tolerate the regimen well. The most clinically significant toxicity of melphalan is myelosuppression, particularly a delayed thrombocytopenia. A CBC, including a platelet count, should be performed biweekly for 2 months of therapy and monthly thereafter. If significant myelosuppression occurs (usually thrombocytopenia or neutropenia), the dosage or the treatment frequency may need to be reduced.",

Cyclophosphamide is initiated at a dosage of 200 mg/m 2 given intravenously once, at the same time oral melphalan therapy is started. Because cyclophosphamide is less likely to affect thrombocytes, it may be substituted in patients in which thrombocytopenia has developed secondary to long-term melphalan use.

Objective laboratory improvement, including reduction in serum immunoglobulin or Bence Jones proteinuria, usually is noted within 3 to 6 weeks.

Ophthalmic complications (including longstanding retinal detachment) and paraneoplastic neuropathies can be expected to resolve along with the tumor mass. 45, 55 In one report on cats that responded to melphalan and prednisone, clinical improvement was noted in 4 weeks and serum protein and radiographic bone abnormalities were greatly improved by 8 weeks. 8 As previously discussed, MM does not resolve completely, and a good response is defined as a reduction in measured M component (i.e., immunoglobulin or Bence Jones proteins) by at least 50% of pretreatment values. 4 Reduction in the serum immunoglobulin levels may lag behind reduction in Bence Jones proteinuria, because the half-lives are 15 to 20 days and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. 66 For routine follow-up, quantification of the elevated serum immunoglobulin or urine Bence Jones protein is performed monthly until a good response is noted and then every 2 to 3 months.

Hypercalcemia, Bence Jones proteinuria, and extensive bony lysis are known negative prognostic indices in the dog. 1 The long-term prognosis for dogs with MM is poor, because recurrence of the tumor mass and associated clinical signs is expected. Eventually, the tumor no longer responds to available chemotherapeutic drugs, and death follows from renal failure, sepsis, or euthanasia for intractable bone or spinal pain. 1, 4 The prognosis for MM in the cat is not as favorable in the short term as it is in the dog. 4, 7, 8, 22 Although most cats (approximately 60%) transiently respond to melphalan/prednisone-or cyclophosphamide-based protocols, most responses are partial and not durable.

A number of large case compilations of cutaneous plasmacytoma have been reported in the dog. 13, [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] Plasmacytomas represented 2.4% of all canine tumor submissions in one large compilation of cases. 78 In this series of 751 cases, the most common locations in the dog were cutaneous sites (86%) (Figure 31-30) , the mucous membranes of the oral cavity and lips (9%) (Figure 31-31) , and the rectum and colon (4%). The skin of the limbs and head (including the ears) is the most frequently reported cutaneous site. 71, 72, 77 All other sites accounted for the remaining 1% of cases; these sites may include the stomach, spleen, genitalia, eyes, uterus, and liver. The American cocker spaniel, English cocker spaniel, and West Highland white terrier (and perhaps Yorkshire terriers, boxers, German shepherds, and Airedale terriers) have an increased risk of developing plasmacytomas, and the median age of affected dogs is 9 to 10 years. 77, 78 Cutaneous and oral EMP in dogs typically manifests as benign tumors that are highly amenable to local therapy. The natural behavior of noncutaneous/nonoral EMP appears to be somewhat more aggressive in the dog. Gastrointestinal EMP has been reported in a number of sites in the veterinary literature, including the esophagus, 79 stomach ( Figure 31-32) , 64,80 small intestine, 81 and large intestine. 78, 80, [81] [82] [83] Metastasis to associated lymph nodes is more common in these cases; however, bone marrow involvement and monoclonal gammopathies are less commonly encountered. In nine cases of colorectal EMP, only two dogs experienced recurrence after surgical excision, and two cases involved multiple lesions. 78 EMP of the trachea, liver, and uterus also have been reported in a dog, and all had a benign course after local resection. [84] [85] [86] Most cases of SOP eventually progress to systemic MM; however, the time course from local tumor development to systemic MM may be many months to years. 31, 87 SOPs reported in the dog have involved the zygomatic arch and the ribs. 31 Plasmacytomas are less common in cats, and fewer reports exist in the literature. 18, [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] They occur in older cats (mean age, 8.5 years) with no significant gender predilection. The skin is the most common site; other sites include the oral cavity, eye, GI tract, liver, subcutaneous tissues, and brain. Two reports exist of cutaneous EMP in cats that progressed to systemic disease; one cat developed lymph node and distant metastasis, the other progressed to MM. 18 ",

Gastrointestinal EMP, however, typically produces relatively nonspecific signs that may suggest alimentary involvement. Colorectal plasmacytomas usually cause rectal bleeding, hematochezia, tenesmus, and rectal prolapse. 78 One case of ataxia and seizure activity in a dog with EMP secondary to tumor-associated hypoglycemia has been reported. 54 SOP usually is associated with pain and lameness (if the appendicular skeleton is affected) or with neurologic signs (if vertebral bodies are involved).",

No prognostic significance has been observed with this classification system, although it has been suggested that the polymorphous blastic type may act more aggressively in the dog. 13, 77, 88 With poorly differentiated solitary plasmacytic tumors, immunohistochemical studies directed at detecting immunoglobulin, light and heavy chains, and thioflavine T may be helpful for differentiating the lesions from other round cell tumors. 31, 76, 77, [92] [93] [94] Immunoreactivity has been demonstrated for canine IgG F(ab) 2 and vimentin. 73 A variant characterized by an IgG-reactive amyloid interspersed with the neoplastic cells also has been described. 74 In addition, PCR techniques can be used to determine the clonality of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene in plasmacytomas and myelomas, which may be diagnostically useful in difficult cases.",

Cutaneous and mucocutaneous plasmacytomas usually are cured by surgical excision. 13, 77 In large compilations of cases in dogs, the local recurrence rate was approximately 5%, and nodal or distant metastasis occurred in only seven of 349 cases (2%). 13, [71] [72] [73] 77 New cutaneous plasmacytomas at sites distant from the primary tumor developed in fewer than 2% of cases. One caveat: the author has encountered a handful of cases of aggressive multiple cutaneous plasmacytoma that eventual resulted in the death of the affected dogs. Neither the tumor cell proliferation rate (as measured by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry) in the dog nor histopathologic grading in dogs and cats was prognostic in large compilations of cases, although it has been suggested that the polymorphous blastic type may act more aggressively in the dog. 13, 77, 88 The presence of amyloid and overexpression of cyclin D1 (prognostic in human plasmacytomas) were not shown to be prognostic in dogs. 13 Most dogs with EMP of the alimentary tract and other abdominal organs (e.g., liver, uterus) that is treated by surgical excision alone or in combination with systemic chemotherapy (if metastasis is present) can enjoy long-term survival. 31, 64, [78] [79] [80] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] In a compilation of nine dogs with colorectal plasmacytoma, two had local recurrence at 5 and 8 months after surgery; after surgery alone, the overall median survival time was 15 months. 78 DNA ploidy and c-myc oncoprotein expression in biopsy samples were determined to be predictive for EMPs in dogs; however, tumors that were malignant all were from noncutaneous sites (i.e., lymph node, colon, and spleen), therefore location appears to be as predictive. 96 As previously discussed,",

SECTION C Canine Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Chronic Myeloproliferative Diseases, and Myelodysplasia Karen M. Young and David M. Vail Myeloproliferative diseases are a group of neoplastic diseases of bone marrow marked by unregulated clonal proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells. 1 Excessive proliferation of cells with defective maturation and function leads to reduction of normal hematopoiesis and invasion of other tissues. MPDs have been classified based on the biologic behavior, the degree of cellular differentiation, and the lineage of the neoplastic cells (granulocytic, monocytic, erythroid, megakaryocytic, or mixed), and newer classification systems in humans have incorporated genetics. In 1991 the Animal Leukemia Study Group made recommendations for the classification of nonlymphoid leukemias in dogs and cats. 2 More recently, the Oncology Committee of the American College of Veterinary Pathologists (ACVP) established a Myeloid Neoplasm",
