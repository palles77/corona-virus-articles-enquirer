[2] [3] 9 The results of this study have further proven previous conclusions. Studies have found that gastrointestinal tractsymptoms are one of the common clinical presentations in SARS and MERS. [4] [5] 9 However, recent studies found that diarrhoea is rare in COVID-19, 2-3,10 with an incidence of about 3%. A US study reported that their first patient, who had mild COVID-19, developed diarrhoea lasting for 2 days. 6 In addition, a study reported that diarrhoea may be an initial symptom of COVID-19. 11 In this study, we found that a minority of patients had an initial symptom of diarrhoea. In contrast to the results of previous studies, this study found that diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting are common in COVID-19. Why are there differences between the results of this study and other past clinical investigations? First, the data sources of these studies vary. The information used by Zhong et al. was obtained from medical records, 3, 10 whereas the data in this study was provided by the patients themselves. Even though this is a retrospective study, the study subjects were adults and most had an educational level of middle school and above, thereby ensuring the reliability and authenticity of the content of this study. Second, the time nodes of the data records are different. The results of this study found that diarrhoea mostly occurred 5 days after the development of initial symptoms; therefore, patients may not have developed gastrointestinal tract symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting in the other studies.

For example, Gong et al. showed that the mean disease course of deceased patients was 10.56 \u00b1 4.42 days. 12 Furthermore, in contrast to cough and other symptoms, diarrhoea in COVID-19 patients lasted for a short duration and mostly occurred as mushy stools instead of watery diarrhoea in SARS. 4 Therefore, diarrhoea may be overlooked by clinicians and patients during COVID-19. As digestive tract symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting tend to be overlooked in 15 Our study showed that digestive tract symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting are common in COVID-19, suggesting that the possibility of fecal-oral transmission is high. Therefore, we need to actively promote hand hygiene to prevent this disease. Moreover, public health authorities need to actively manage digestive tract excretions from patients to prevent the spread of COVID-19.",

First, as COVID-19 is a wasting disease, vomiting and diarrhoea affect nutrient absorption in patients and therefore may affect disease outcomes. Our study found that diarrhoea is significantly correlated with fatigue, suggesting that diarrhoea may decrease the quality of life of patients. Hence, clinicians must actively strengthen nutrition supportive treatment in COVID-19 patients. In addition, Xiao et al. isolated viable SARS-CoV-2 virus from fecal samples of COVID-19 patients and the human receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme, 14 is highly expressed in the stomach, duodenum, and rectal epithelial cells, supporting the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 can enter host cells in the digestive tract. Gu et al. proposed that the digestive tract may be one of the target organs of SARS-CoV-2.",

In terms of educational level, 8.0%(17/212) completed elementary school education, 52.8%(112/212 ) attained middle school education, and 39.2% (83/212) were college graduates. Mean disease course was 26.78 \u00b1 9.16 (range: 3-60) days. There were 12 clinically asymptomatic patients, and mean disease course was 18.08 \u00b1 9.32 (range: 9-33) days. Five of these 12 patients had chest computed tomography (CT) scans that showed viral pneumonia but they had no clinical presentation. Approximately 44.3% of the patients claimed to have a clear contact history with individuals with COVID-19.
