We observed that the severity was related with bacterial detection on tracheal aspirates, independently of fulfilling diagnostic criteria of bacterial pneumonia. These results are similar to those of Suarez-Arrabal et al. with RSV infection.",

The total virus analyzed with a Real-Time PCR (Anyplex II RV16 detection (Seegene, South Korea)) in respiratory samples were: There were recruited 96 patients with LRTI. In 66% RV was detected, similar to the literature. 3, 5 No differences in severity (requirements of ventilatory support, length of ventilatory support and PICU stay) were found between patients infected with RV and patients with other viral detections. The main viral co-detection was RSV (4/11, 36%). No differences in severity between patients with RV and RV plus other viral co-detections were found (Table 1 ). Some series have described that RV could cause a more severe disease in comparison to other frequently detected viruses, such as Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). 5 In contrast, children with bronchiolitis and RV detection had a significantly shorter hospital length of stay as compared with children with RSV bronchiolitis in other series. 6 In our opinion, age, comorbidities 5 and differences in the diagnosis of included patients (bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia, and bronchospasm) could be an important bias when interpreting these different results with regard to the severity of RV infection in comparison to other viruses. We want to remark that we didn't include children younger than 6 months, so the diagnosis of bronchiolitis was importantly avoided. 7 The distribution of patients who met criteria for suspected bacterial infection was similar between those with or without RV. The rate of patients with positive tracheal aspirates cultures was also similar between groups (Table 1) .",

They observed changes of upper respiratory-tract microbiota that could help explain why RV infection predisposes to bacterial otitis media, sinusitis and pneumonia. 10 For this reason, bacterial carriage and, moreover, bacterial infection must be considered when analyzing the severity of rhinovirus infection in comparison to other viruses, and it is often missed.",
