Turbidity was measured on combinations of virus and each sediment type at low concentration to determine aggregation rates. Aggregation of sediment with virus occurred regardless of mineral type, and larger fraction of virus is expected to aggregate with increasing sediment concentration leading to higher deposition rates. The negatively charged sediments, aggregated with \u03c66 (also negatively charged at neutral pH) at a faster rate than the positively charged sediments, yielding turbidity slopes of 4.94 \u00d7 10 \u22123 s \u22121 and 7.50 \u00d7 10 \u22124 s \u22121 for \u03c66-montmorillonite and \u03c66-illite aggregates, respectively, and 2.98 \u00d7 10 \u22125 s \u22121 and 2.84 \u00d7 10 \u22125 s \u22121 , for \u03c66-goethite and \u03c66-kaolinite, respectively. This indicates that the interaction between sediments and virus is hydrophobic, rather than electrostatic. Large numbers of virions remained viable postaggregation, despite the fragility of the viral envelope, indicating that small-sized aggregates, which may travel more readily through porous media, may pose an infection risk. The fraction of \u03c66 that remained viable varied with sediment type, with montmorillonite-\u03c66 aggregates experiencing the greatest reduction in infectivity at 35%. TEM analyses reveal that in all sediment-\u03c66 combinations, infectivity loss was likely due to disassembly of the viral envelope as a result of aggregation.",

Bacteriophage alter biogeochemical cycles through lysis of bacterial cells (D\u00edaz-Mu\u00f1oz and Koskella and Brockhurst, 2014) and impact eukaryotes that depend on bacterial populations, thus having a significant impact on the greater ecosystem. The distribution and residence time of viruses is affected by the chemistry of the water, e.g., dissolved organic matter, metals, and contaminants, but also the suspended materials, such as particulate organic matter (POM) and suspended sediment, primarily clays, which serve as substrate and habitat for biofilm-producing bacteria (Alimova et al., 2006; Alimova et al., 2009) . In fact, sediment-bearing biofilms have been shown to sequester virus particles in wetlands where they are subsequently concentrated and subject to re-release (Flood and Ashbolt, 2000) . Furthermore, bacteriophages are utilized as subsurface tracers and indicators for a variety of environmental applications (Ghanem et al., 2018; Keswick et al., 1982; Redman et al., 1997) and, therefore, their interaction with sediments may affect their quantification in hydrological experiments.",

In aquatic systems, the length of time in which a virus can interact with potential hosts is largely controlled by sinking rates (Fuhrman, 1999) . These rates are strongly influenced by aggregation with suspended particles. Sediments are known to influence virus transport and survival in porous media by controlling the potential for viruses to contaminate groundwater (Jin and Flury, 2002; Chu et al., 2000) and to promote lysis of bacteria in soils (Kimura et al., 2008) . The mineralogy and size of suspended sediments affects the extent to which viruses will aggregate and sorb to sediments (Chu et al., 2000; Jin and Flury, 2002; McGechan and Lewis, 2002; Syngouna and Chrysikopoulos, 2015) . With a few recent exceptions, enveloped viruses (Block et al., 2016; Block et al., 2014) , have been largely omitted from studies of virus-sediment interaction, aggregation, and viability. Enveloped viruses possess different structural properties from nonenveloped viruses and include important plant and animal pathogens such as herpesvirus, coronavirus and Influenza A and B, all of which are found in natural and wastewaters (Batik et al., 1980; Gundy et al., 2008; Rosenberg et al., 1980; Sharp et al., 1975; Stallknecht et al., 1990a; Stallknecht et al., 1990b) .",

For non-enveloped viruses, the surface charge is determined by the protonation/deprotonation of amino acids in the capsid (Elimelech et al., 1995) . However, for enveloped virions, surface charge is determined by envelope proteins and lipids. The colloidal interaction between virus particles and the small fraction of suspended sediments can be described by DLVO theory (Derjaguin and Landau, 1941; Verwey and Overbeek, 1948) , in which the potential between colloidal particles is the sum of the attractive van der Waals potential and the Coulomb potential (repulsive for like-charged particles and attractive for oppositely-charged particles). DLVO theory has been extended to include hydrophobic forces (van Oss, 1993; van Oss et al., 1990) .",

Chrysikopoulos and Syngouna (2012) looked at attachment of the bacteriophages MS2 and \u03c6X174 to kaolinite or montmorillonite, and using extended DLVO energy calculations, concluded that the virus-clay attachment was primarily through hydrophobic interaction.",

The transmitted light was collected by a second optical fiber coupled to a spectrophotometer equipped with a CCD (HR2000, Ocean Optics, Inc.) which transferred the data to a personal computer. A 1 mm diameter aperture positioned in front of the collection fiber limited data collection to transmitted light while blocking scattered light. A magnetic stirrer was employed to prevent settling of the suspended colloidal aggregates. The distance between the cuvette and aperture was 5 cm, limiting the collection solid angle to 0.00003 sr and thus restricting the intensity of forward scattered light incident on the collection fiber (Katz et al., 2013) .

Based on the measured turbidity, the stock \u03c66 concentration was determined to be 7.8 \u00d7 10 11 cm \u22123 , prior to the 2\u00d7 dilution incurred when mixed with an equal volume of suspended sediments. This estimate is slightly larger than the estimate from counting PFUs (6.8 \u00d7 10 11 cm \u22123 ) but is likely more accurate as it also includes virions rendered non-infectious due to envelope defects. \u03c66, due to its lower refractive index and smaller size, scatters less efficiently than the selected sediments. Therefore, for the heteroaggregation turbidity experiments, the \u03c66 concentration was adjusted to have a lower turbidity than the turbidity at the lowest sediment concentration.

Due to both the larger volume of the sediment primary particles (~0.2 \u03bcm) and higher refractive index. Refractive indices of the three sediment types are (geometric mean of the three axes): goethite: n = 2.18; illite: n = 1.58; kaolinite: n = 1.56; montmorillonite: n = 1.55 (Deer et al., 1992; Shannon et al., 2002; Weidler and Friedrich, 2007) compared to \u03c66 particles (80 nm), the sediment primary particles have a higher scattering cross-section than the virions. Therefore, the heteroaggregation experiments were performed using a higher concentration of viral particles than sediments. The sediment concentrations were adjusted to have a turbidity of~0.6 (after 2\u00d7 dilution by addition of virus suspension) at 750 nma wavelength in which light extinction losses are primarily due to scattering rather than absorption. The concentrations were chosen so that the total volume of the scatterers was b0.1% of suspension volume, thus staying in the single scattering regime and keeping the incidence of multiple scattering small (Katz et al., 2013; Wind and Szymanski, 2002; Xu and Sun, 2010) , while still providing a reasonable signal-to-noise level.

In the \u03c66-kaolinite and \u03c66-illite aggregates, the virions in the pellets, i.e. aggregated virions, show an appreciable loss in infectivity (14% and 27% of original virus populations remained viable for kaolinite and illite, respectively), while virions that did not aggregate remained close to 100% viable. For the \u03c66-goethite heteroaggregates, 49% of the virions in the pellets remained viable, while supernatant virion viability was near 100%. The higher viability values for in the \u03c66-goethite pellet is likely due to fewer virions aggregating as a result of the lower goethite concentration required to achieve approximately equal turbidity as in the experiments with clay minerals to account for goethite's greater refractive index.",

At higher sediment concentrations, we expect an even larger viral fraction to aggregate, resulting in higher deposition rates. Nevertheless, at the low concentrations of our experiments, heteroaggregated viruses experienced a loss of infectivity. Despite the fragility of the viral envelope, a large number of virions remained viable, indicating that small-sized heteroaggregates may pose an infection risk. While non-aggregated virions in the \u03c66goethite, \u03c66 -kaolinite and \u03c66illite suspensions remained near 100% viable, in the \u03c66montmorillonite suspensions, a substantial fraction (35%) of the non-aggregated \u03c66 also lost viability. TEM analysis revealed that the observed reduction in infectivity is likely due to partial disassembly of the viral envelope after aggregation. In conclusion, it is expected that viral disassembly and loss of infectivity is likely to be exacerbated with increased contact between virions and sediments which occurs within larger aggregates.",

Our results suggest that soils containing clay minerals, and in particular, montmorillonite, may potentially serve to inactivate viruses possessing a rigid lipid envelopes during colloidal transport. However, our results also show that even in the case of viruses that are not inactivated by association with a solid phase, colloidal sediments could facilitate the transport of viruses into aquifers as small heteroaggregates. Furthermore, because multiple virions aggregate with colloidal sediment even in dilute concentrations, forming heteroaggregates in the colloidal size range, this interaction must be considered in conjunction with specific infectivity (Ghanem et al., 2018) when phages are used in tracer experiments.",
