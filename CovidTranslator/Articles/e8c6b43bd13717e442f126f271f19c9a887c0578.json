The purpose of this study was to characterize the molecular mechanism of the functional changes of CD11b + /Ly6C intermediate macrophages after renal IRI. The gene expression profiles of CD11b + /Ly6C intermediate macrophages of the sham surgery mice, and the mice 4 h, 24 h and 9 days after renal IRI were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Analysis of mRNA expression profiles was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), biological processes and pathways by the series test of cluster. Protein-protein interaction network was constructed and analysed to discover the key genes. A total of 6738 DEGs were identified and assigned to 20 model profiles. DEGs in profile 13 were one of the predominant expression profiles, which are involved in immune cell chemotaxis and proliferation. Signet analysis showed that Atp5a1, Atp5o, Cox4i, Cdc42, Rac2 and Nhp2 were the key genes involved in oxidation-reduction, apoptosis, migration, M1-M2 differentiation, and proliferation of macrophages. RPS18 may be an appreciate reference gene as it was stable in macrophages. The identified DEGs and their enriched pathways investigate factors that may participate in the functional changes of CD11b + /Ly6C intermediate macrophages after renal IRI. Moreover, the vital gene Nhp2 may involve the polarization of macrophages, which may be a new target to affect the process of AKI.",

According to the whole genome microarray analysis data, the CD11b + /Ly6C high population was associated with the onset of renal injury and produced proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, the CD11b + / Ly6C int population demonstrated a wound healing phenotype [14] . Dragomir et al reported that CD11b + / Ly6C lo cells were larger than CD11b + /Ly6C hi cells, and more irregularly shaped. Moreover, CD11b + /Ly6C lo cells contained a highly vacuolated cytoplasm and an increased cytoplasm:nuclear ratio. RT-PCR analysis revealed that mRNA expression levels related to proinflammatory proteins (for example, TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, and the chemokine receptor CCR2) were significantly higher in CD11b + /Ly6C hi cells than in CD11b + / Ly6C lo cells. In contrast, the mRNA expression level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was reduced in CD11b + /Ly6C hi cells when compared to CD11b + / Ly6C lo cells [15] . Clements et al investigated the genes that were uniquely expressed in each population. It is necessary to consider of genes that were regulated in each phenotype over time [14] .",

The proportion of CD11b + /Ly6C int macrophages was at a maximum one day after IRI and was markedly reduced at day 9 after IRI. Taking this into consideration, the genes in the profile 13 were involved in infiltration and proliferation. GO analysis of profile 13 showed that the genes related to the extracellular vesicular exosome were significantly changed, which was consistent with the finding that CD11b + /Ly6C int macrophage could secrete anti-inflammation cytokines [15] . GO and pathway analysis indicated that immune cell chemotaxis (for example, neutrophil, leukocyte, lymphocyte, monocyte, and macrophage) and G1/S progression were downregulated at later time points. In mitochondria, the oxidation-reduction process and respiratory electron transport were significantly involved after IRI as At-p5a1, Atp5o, and Cox4i1 are also key genes in the PPI network. It would be required to further assess the vitality, switch and infiltration ability of CD11b + /Ly6C int macrophages, given that Cdc42 and Rac2 were found to have an effect on apoptosis, migration, and M1-M2 differentiation [24, 25] . Protein phosphatase 2A (Pp2a) is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene that is involved in mitosis and apoptosis [26] . Homologues Ppp2ca (Pp2ac) and Ppp2cb are the catalytic subunits of Pp2a [27] . Previous studies have shown that upregulation of Ppp2ca in systemic lupus erythematosus decreased IL-2 [28] , resulting in the generation of effector and memory T cells and the maintenance of regulatory T cells [29] . Moreover, it was suggested that reduction of Ppp2ca may play a role in anti-inflammatory progression by increasing osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression and decreasing receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB ligand (RANKL) expression [30] . In prostate cancer cells, loss of Ppp2ca facilitated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition [31] . Taken together, the reduction of Ppp2ca in profile 13 may be a reason why CD11b + /Ly6C int macrophages decreased inflammation.",
