As an evidence of the current scenario, many cities of developed and developing nation like Japan, Hong-Kong, China, Malaysia, and India are moving towards the construction of cohesive skyline structures or mega tall buildings. On contrary to these advancements, mega tall buildings in the urban area affect the surrounding wind flow pattern and pedestrian level wind (PLW) comfort.",

There are many such incidents which are reported due to strong winds. But nowadays modern megacities are packed with the high density of high rise buildings, which influences the air movement. The reduced air movement at pedestrian level causes weak natural ventilation and allow the pollutants to be accumulated at ground level which increases air pollution. Such wind conditions are persistent in Hong Kong, Tokyo and New Delhi [1] . Many causalities have been reported due to the accumulation of air-borne SARS virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) because of low wind speed zone at a building site in Hong Kong [2] . So it is inevitable to assess wind condition for pedestrian level comfort in the view of low wind speed as well as strong winds near buildings corners. Many urban authorities have made it is essential to study the pedestrian level wind environment for large urban projects during initial design stage [3] [4] [5] [6] .",

As it is not viable to conduct full-scale testing for the initial design of a building project site, so wind tunnel measurements on the scaled model make it feasible to investigate the effect of changes in building design at the initial stage of the urban project. During early days, wind tunnel measurement for PLWs was conducted with hot wire or film anemometry at limited measurement points [7] [8] [9] [10] . Later on, Irwin [11] devised a simple omni-direction probe for PLW speed measurement. In which pressure difference between tubes at scaled pedestrian height and surface of the tunnel is calibrated with the corresponding velocity. Recently the use of Irwin probes has been paced up due to the availability of high precision simultaneous pressure measuring sensor. Further, the use of sand erosion technique for such studies is limited as it provides qualitative information over the whole area under investigation [12] . There are other measuring techniques which have been used to evaluate PLW speed such as laser Doppler anemometry (LDA), particle image velocimetry PIV, Infrared thermography and thermistor anemometry.",

These modification can be obtained by either wind tunnel measurement or using CFD simulation. The whole research community in this area is devoted to evaluate the design related modification.

One of the major advantages of CFD over wind tunnel testing is that it gives detailed flow field data of associated parameters over the entire computational domain. In addition, similarity law requirements associated with wind tunnel testing is not a limitation of CFD simulation. Most of the studies, to simulate wind environment are based on the use of different RANS turbulence models e.g. Std. \u2212 k \u03b5, Realizable \u2212 k \u03b5 and RNG \u2212 k \u03b5 model with default values of model closure coefficients in CFD tools. However, the major issue for the acceptance of CFD results is related to the accuracy, which suffers badly in predicting the flow on leeward side of building. Therefore CFD simulation results require verification and validation [40] . Zahid Iqbal et al. [2] mentioned that the simulation results for PLW speed obtained by std. \u2212 k \u03b5 are also affected for different model closure coefficients.

They reported the agreement between full-scale and wind tunnel measurement within 10% for windy locations. Dye [28] compared the same in a sheltered urban area and found that wind tunnel test generally underpredicts the mean speed of 20% at most severe locations. While Visser et al.

Numerical Simulation has been conducted using best practice guidelines [75] for pedestrian level wind flow. All the details related to CFD simulation is not included as it is beyond the scope of this paper. The result of this simulation is presented in Fig. 4 , which represent the contours of mean wind speed at pedestrian height for lift-up and conventional square buildings. The qualitative results of the present simulation are similar to the experimental study by Tse et al. [1] which shows high wind speed near the lift up area and further lower values of low wind speed as compared to conventional building design. Which helps in improving ventilation near the building In addition to this lift up area can be used for other purposes as the recreational area, parking, or shelter for pedestrians. Besides this, use of lift up building design is limited due to unacceptable or high wind speed zone near the lift-up area [76] . This unacceptable wind condition arises due to flow through openings of positive and negative pressure faces of the building.",

The authors concluded that the wind speed along streets decreases with blockage ratio (R B describe the percentage of oncoming air flow captured by building block) and proposed a simplified relation for wind speed up ratio as given in Eq.

(2) The probability of exceedance of threshold wind velocity at the particular site requires terrain and design related modifications. To obtain terrain related modification accurately, improved roughness mapping is required. Otherwise, it may lead to wrong decisions in urban planning. (3) To obtain design related modifications, Irwin probes provide relatively accurate results and can be facilitated at numerous locations for simultaneous measurement of mean wind speed and turbulence intensity. (4) To simulate PLW environment, steady RANS method is the best choice economically, however, LES and DES provide more accurate results. Further to improve the accuracy of steady RANS using std. \u2212 k \u03b5 model, the effect of different model closure coefficient needs to be investigated in detail. (5) Several parameters related to building design e.g. height & width of buildings have an adverse effect on PLW environment, however, building depth does not affect PLW environment significantly. Moreover, studies based on different grouping of buildings suggest that configuration with square central space provides better PLW environment. In addition, uses of lift up buildings podium, corner modified buildings offer a positive design approach.",
