Most if not all patient necessary patient-provider contacts should be telehealth / remotely unless the patient describes an urgent problem. 6 Phone calls to labor and delivery (L&D) should be triaged according to Labor presents a unique scenario in the COVID-19 pandemic, as all hospital admissions are anticipated and the timing of many admissions to the hospital are planned. In anticipation of hospital admission, women should be instructed to discontinue work or begin working from home a minimum of 2 weeks prior to anticipated delivery, and to practice strict social isolation during this time. This is to limit the risk of exposure. For the majority of women, this should be initiated at 37 weeks. L&D units should prepare simulations for COVID-19 pandemic, including for PPE donning, etc. They should appropriate designate rooms and operating rooms (ORs). For women with planned admissions for induction of labor or cesarean section, consider screening each individual and her birthing partner by phone the day before admission. When women arrive to L&D, a designated staff member at the front of the unit (e.g., patient access coordinator, unit coordinator, etc.) should verbally screen each individual for upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms. Any woman reporting fever, cough, or respiratory symptoms should be given a surgical mask, and evaluated by RN or OB provider. See Figure 2 for recommended flow.",

For any patients with respiratory symptoms full droplet precautions should be utilized including gloves, gown, surgical mask with a face shield. N95 mask should be worn in addition to droplet precaution PPE for any patients with suspected or confirmed COVID, and for any patient, regardless of respiratory symptoms, during indispensable aerosolizing procedures, including second stage of labor. 8, 11 As much as possible, oxygen should not be given aerosolized. In addition, hand hygiene with alcohol based rub after every patient contact and appropriate donning and doffing of PPE are critical. 8-12 Finally, rooms that are exposed need to be wiped down as respiratory viruses may spread from surface contact. 13 These aggressive measures can help limit transmission throughout providers in a healthcare setting.

This recommendation will vary depending on current state of COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in a region early in COVID-19 emergence it may be prudent to get patients delivered prior to high COVID-19 burden in the hospital. For sites with an existing high COVID-19 burden, an additional 1-2 days in the hospital, occupying a hospital bed, for an induction of labor may not be possible. Other site-specific and COVID-19 specific considerations may include options such as beginning the induction process at home to limit in-hospital time (e.g., outpatient Foley bulb cervical ripening). Induction can still be conducted as usual, with a combination of Foley 60-80 mL single balloon for 12 hours and either oral misoprostol 25 mcg initially, followed by 25 mcg every 2-4 hours, or 50 mcg every 4-6 hours (if no more than 3 contractions per 10 minutes or prior uterine surgery), or oxytocin infusion.15 Outpatient Foley ripening can be considered for low risk women, to minimize contacts. Cesarean delivery should not be performed before 15 hours of oxytocin and amniotomy if feasible, and ideally after 18-24 hours of oxytocin.15",
