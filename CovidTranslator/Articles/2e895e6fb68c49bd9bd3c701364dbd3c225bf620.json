We have previously reported, for the first time, the development of recombinant NDVs designed for enhanced cancer therapeutic efficacy. Specifically, we have shown that NDV engineered to express interleukin-2 (IL-2) generates a robust therapeutic response associated with increased tumor-specific T-cell infiltration after intratumoral administration in mice. We have now demonstrated that this therapeutic response is dependent on T cells and we have investigated the potential to focus the NDV-induced immune response toward a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) to enhance the inherent therapeutic efficacy of NDV further. We found that intratumoral treatments of tumor-bearing mice with recombinant NDV expressing a model TAA elicited an enhanced tumor-specific response, resulting in a significant increase in the number of complete tumor regressions compared with control NDV. Additionally, coadministration of NDV expressing a model TAA with NDV expressing IL-2 enhanced the TAA-directed response and led to more complete tumor regressions. Our results show that TAA-directed immunotherapy by oncolytic recombinant NDV alone or in combination with IL-2 results in an enhanced therapeutic efficacy and warrant consideration in the development of cancer therapies based on the use of oncolytic NDV.",

            "text": "As a result of genetic alterations, tumors express unique antigens that can be recognized by T cells. Tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) can be tumor-specific antigens, shared antigens specific from particular cell lineages, differentiation antigens, mutated proteins, antigens derived from oncogenes or viral antigens. 1 These antigens are processed and presented by major histocompatibility complex class I and major histocompatibility complex class II molecules for priming and activating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. [2] [3] [4] Numerous studies indicate that the immune system has the potential of eliciting a T cell-mediated tumor-specific immune response capable of large tumor destruction. Despite this fact, cancer cells, even when expressing these antigens, may not elicit a robust immune response. In some cases, cancer cells escape immune detection because they originate from normal cells and do not activate antigenpresenting cells. 5 Nonactivated antigen-presenting cells that present unique cancer antigens without co-stimulation could lead to tolerance. 6, 7 Specifically, T cells that encounter TAAs in the absence of co-stimulation may become ignorant, anergic, or apoptotic. 8, 9 Therefore, although a robust TAA-specific immune response is capable of tumor eradication, the tolerance generated during oncogenic development may lead to large tumor growth. 10 Although TAA tolerance presents a significant challenge to cancer immunotherapy, this barrier can be overcome. Interestingly, several viruses are strong inducers of an immune response and offer an attractive strategy for cancer therapy by stimulating the patient's immune system within the tumor in order to overcome these immunologic barriers. The ability of oncolytic viruses to induce tumorspecific immune responses has been well documented, tested in clinical trials, 11 and was also recently reported by our group when intratumoral injections of a recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) caused complete tumor regression in tumor-bearing mice, and protected these mice against subsequent tumor challenge with the same parental tumor cells. 12 In our previous report, we found that intratumoral injection of NDV/F3aa resulted in complete regression in 20% of mice bearing subcutaneously implanted CT26 autologous colon carcinoma cells. In addition, recombinant expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) by NDV/F3aa enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of this treatment and resulted in 60% of the mice undergoing complete regression, consistent with previous reports using HSV-expressing IL-2 (refs. 13, 14) . Mice that underwent complete regression in either treatment were protected from subsequent tumor rechallenge highlighting the induction of a potent and longlasting antitumor adaptive immune response. Mice treated with NDV/F3aa-IL-2 also had increased T-cell infiltration and enhanced tumor-specific adaptive immune responses, correlating with the enhanced therapeutic response. We have now investigated whether expression of a TAA by a genetically engineered NDV could focus the NDV-induced adaptive T-cell response toward the TAA and enhance the NDV therapeutic efficacy.",

To study the ability of NDV to induce a TAA-specific response we have used a tumor model system in which \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal) is expressed by murine CT26 tumor cells. In this model, expression of a \u03b2-gal-derived major histocompatibility complex class I H-2 L d epitope (amino acid sequence TPHPARIGL) by NDV allowed the evaluation of a single CD8 T-cell antigenic determinant in enhancing the regression of established CT26 tumors by NDV. This CD8 T-cell epitope has previously been reported to be an effective TAA target for the generation of T cells against CT26 colon carcinoma cells expressing \u03b2-gal. 15 Because \u03b2-gal is a xenogeneic antigen, this model is an example of tumors that express unique nonself antigens such as viral antigens, mutated self-antigens, 16 or frame-shift mutations. 17",

We chose the NDV/F3aa backbone, containing a multibasic cleavage site in the F protein of the virus, based on our previous studies showing increased antitumor efficacy of this virus compared with the wild-type parental NDV (B1 strain). For proper expression by the NDV replication/transcription machinery, the minigal epitope was flanked by NDV-specific transcriptional start and stop signals. 18 In addition, the epitope was expressed after an endoplasmic reticulum-insertion sequence which was known to enhance the immunogenicity of the encoded epitope by directing the epitope to the endoplasmic reticulum, most likely enhancing antigen presentation. [19] [20] [21] Endoplasmic reticulum-targeted CD8 T-cell epitopes are at least as immunogenic as the full-length proteins from which they are derived. 22 The recombinant NDV/F3aaminigal was rescued as previously described, 18 plaque purified, and the growth kinetics of this virus in A549 cells were comparable to the previously reported recombinant NDV/F3aa-IL-2 (Figure 1b) .",

For this purpose, we tested the therapeutic efficacy of recombinant NDV/F3aa-IL-2 in a nude mouse model. Nude mice are severely deficient in T cells and produce only small numbers of T cells due to a genetic mutation in the Foxn1 gene that causes a developmental deterioration of the thymus. 24 Nude mice maintain normal numbers of macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, antigen-presenting cell functions, and normal complement activity. BALB/c nude mice were subcutaneously injected with the 5 \u00d7 10 5 syngeneic CT26 colon carcinoma cells. The injected cells were allowed to establish solid tumors until tumors reached between 5 and 8 mm in diameter (~12 days). Mice were then treated with 1 \u00d7 10 7 plaque-forming units (pfu) of recombinant NDV every other day for a total of four intratumoral injections. As seen in Figure 2 , nude mice treated with NDV/F3aa-IL-2 did not undergo a single complete regression and tumor growth was not impaired as compared to phosphate-buffered saline-treated nude mice. Same results were obtained in nude mice treated with NDV/ F3aa-minigal virus, which in this case was used as a control virus, because the used CT26 cells did not express \u03b2-gal. This is in contrast to our previously reported results where 6/10 immunocompetent BALB/c mice underwent complete regression following NDV/F3aa-IL-2 intratumoral treatments and 2/10 mice following NDV/F3aa treatment. 12 These results highlight the dependency for T-cell function in both treatment groups and illustrate that T cells are critical for therapeutic efficacy.",

            "text": "Here, we investigate the use of reverse genetics to enhance the therapeutic antitumor efficacy of NDV by eliciting a TAA-focused immune response. We first demonstrate the dependence of T cells for NDV oncolytic therapy in the CT26 murine colon carcinoma tumor model. We previously reported the induction of an adaptive immune response against tumor cells resulting in 20% of CT26 tumor-bearing mice undergoing complete tumor regression following intratumoral injections of NDV/F3aa. Importantly, the induced antitumor adaptive response in surviving treated mice was capable of protecting from subsequent tumor rechallenge. 12 This is in contrast to the results in Figure 2 where nude mice subcutaneously implanted with CT26 cells did not undergo tumor regressions upon NDV oncolytic therapy (0/15 mice). Additionally, we found that tumor-bearing nude mice treated with NDV/F3aa expressing the T-cell growth factor IL-2 were also unresponsive to treatment therapy (0/15). Although we cannot exclude that the role of T cells in these experiments might be supportive of other cellular functions different from direct lysis of tumor cells, we conclude that the presence of T cells is necessary for antitumor efficacy by NDV, and highlights the importance of T cells in NDV oncolytic therapy. This is in contrast to other virus oncolytic agents, such as vesicular stomatitis virus, which can mediate destruction of tumors in mice in the absence of T cells. 26 This is probably due to the more robust cytolytic activity and higher levels of replication of vesicular stomatitis virus in tumor cells as compared with NDV. Next, we investigated the potential to enhance the T cellmediated oncolytic efficacy of NDV by expression of a TAA in NDV, which would result in overexpression of this TAA in NDVinfected cells. This approach resulted in enhanced therapeutic efficacy of NDV against CT26 tumors expressing the same TAA. Specifically, intratumoral inoculations of oncolytic NDV expressing a model TAA (minigal) induced an enhanced TAA-specific immune response resulting in an increased percentage of regressions of tumors expressing the same TAA (CT26.CL25) (5 of 10 mice, compared with 2 of 10 mice in NDV/F3aa-GFP controltreated mice). Furthermore, tumor-bearing mice that did not express the model TAA (CT26.wt tumor-bearing mice) responded similar to the treatment with NDV/F3aa-minigal or with NDV/ F3aa-GFP, demonstrating the specificity of the response for the TAA. We also found that co-expression of the T-cell growth factor IL-2 and TAA by NDV significantly improved the T cell-directed therapeutic response, resulting in 9 of 10 mice undergoing complete tumor regression (P = 0.0114). These mice had a significant increase in their tumor-specific T-cell immune response and an increased T cell-specific response to the \u03b2-gal TAA peptide. This enhanced therapeutic response might be a result of an increase in T-cell infiltration within the tumor of mice treated with NDV/ F3aa-IL-2, resulting in increased antitumor-specific adaptive responses, as we reported previously 12 or of a reverse of anergy in T cells upon IL-2 signaling. 27 Nonetheless, the increased TAA-specific adaptive response upon IL-2 treatment translates into an increased therapeutic response by NDV, consistent with a previous report observed using poxvirus TAA-directed therapy. 28 Interestingly, high levels of IFN-\u03b3 after incubation with CT26.wt cells were produced by LN cells derived from CT26.CL25 tumorbearing mice treated with NDV/F3aa-minigal. We speculate that this high level of IFN-\u03b3 production can be explained by a broadening effect that others have observed when immunizing against a specific antigen. For example, Markiewicz et al. have shown that cured mice vaccinated with p815 tumor peptide rejected a tumorderived cell line that did not express the vaccine peptide. 29 Also, mice vaccinated with DNA encoding her-2/neu rejected her-2/ neu negative tumors in 50% of mice. 30 This phenomenon, referred to as antigen cascade, has also been observed in several other preclinical and clinical reports. [31] [32] [33] [34] NDV possesses numerous characteristics making it an ideal vaccine vector and is recognized as an effective vaccine vector capable of eliciting a potent immune response targeted to the encoded vaccine antigens. The ability of recombinant NDV vectors to be used as a prophylactic vaccine vector has been harnessed by several groups and used for vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus, 35 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, [36] [37] [38] simian immunodeficiency virus, 39 human parainfluenza virus type 3, 40 infectious bursal disease virus, 41 as well as severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. 42 These studies have found that NDV vectors expressing foreign antigens are capable of inducing protective immunity against several pathogens in multiple animal models including murine, avian, and nonhuman primates. Importantly, NDV vaccine vectors induced both humoral and cellular immunity against expressed recombinant antigens. Recombinant virus-based immunotherapy is recognized as one of the most potent inducers of TAA-directed CTLs. 43 These tumorspecific CTL-mediated responses are traditionally sought in therapeutic cancer development as well as cancer vaccines, and are important in mediating antitumor responses in vivo. 44 Oncolytic NDV has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in several clinical trials and administration of ex vivo NDV-infected oncolysates to cancer patients results in an increased tumor-specific CD8+ T-cell response and is associated with prolonged survival. 11 While generating an antigen-specific immune response may more easily translate into prophylactic therapies for the prevention of a number of cancers, the necessity for a therapeutic agent given subsequent to cancer diagnosis is traditionally the focus of cancer therapy. Here, we demonstrate the ability to direct a targeted TAA immune response by recombinant NDV encoding a model TAA. Virusbased cancer vaccines targeting specific TAAs for clinical cancer therapy have entered clinical trials and have reported statistically significant therapeutic responses. 45 However, the presence of preexisting neutralizing antibodies to some of these viral vectors is a major concern for their future development. This concern is less important in NDV-TAA vaccine therapy due to the low prevalence of prior exposure in humans to this avian paramyxovirus. NDV is antigenically distinct from common human pathogens and vaccines, making it immunogenic to the general human population without the concern of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies. However, NDV causes hemagglutination and binds to sialic acid, thereby possibly limiting the effectiveness of intravenous delivery.",

Additionally, this response could be further enhanced by co-treatment with NDV expressing IL-2, resulting in 90% of mice undergoing complete tumor regression in our tumor model system. The results presented here are the first to demonstrate the ability of recombinant NDV expressing a TAA to be used as a therapeutic cancer vaccine vector.",
