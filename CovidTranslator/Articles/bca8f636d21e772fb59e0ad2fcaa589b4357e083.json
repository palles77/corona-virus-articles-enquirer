Concurrently, four parameters of open-field behavior, i.e. Ambulations, Rearing, Fine Movements and Central Ambulatory behavior (a measure of anxiety reduction behavior), were assayed by infrared photobeam detection. Time course studies showed that the mechanism of action of the triazolobenzodiazepine (TBZD), adinazolam, (Deracyn@) is dramatically different from that of the classical benzodiazepine (BZD), diazepam (Valium@), i.e., adinazolam increased, whereas diazepam decreased, 5-HT release within CA, region of hippocampus in the freely moving and behaving rat. Adinazolam initially increased NE release and then decreased NE release in CA, region of hippocampus in the freely moving and behaving rat whereas diazepam only decreased the electrochemical signal for NE; the decrease in NE produced by adinazolam was greater than the decrease in NE release produced by diazepam. The Behavioral Activity Patterns, derived from same animal controls, simultaneously with detection of in vivo microvoltammetric signals for NE release and 5-HT release, showed that the BZD, diazepam, exhibited more potent sedative properties than did the TBZD adinazolam. Hippocampal 5-HT and NE release effects of the TBZD, adinazolam, concomitant with behavioral effects lends explanation to the dual anxiolyticlantidepressant properties of the TBZDs.",

Diazepam, the typical BZD, on the other hand, has no antidepressant activity clinically (Lafaille et al., 1991) . The situation remains though, that the clinical results derived from the TBZDs on depression, have virtually never been explained mechanistically from a preclinical viewpoint. For example, although the NE and 5-HT monoamines are integral to cutient thinking about the neurochemistry of depression (Sulser, 1983; Asnis et al., 1992) , adinazolam has been reported to have only weak inhibitory effects on NE reuptake (Sethy and Harris, 1981) , no specific effect on inhibiting the reuptake of 5-HT (Lahti et al., 1983 ) and no effect on dorsal raphe (DR) 5-HT neuronal firing (Tunnel and de . The present hypothesis was that the previous in situ, in vitro and anesthetized studies used, had inherent limitations in the technologies, which masked the detection of changes in the monoamines produced by adinazolam. Therefore, in vivo microvoltammetry with a miniaturized three-microelectrode potentiostat system was utilized to study the effects of adinazolam on CA, hippocampal NE and S-HT release while infrared photocell beams.",

The ability to distinguish between DA and NE, by in vivo microvoltammetry has been published (Broderick, 1988) . In viva electrochemical current was measured in picoamperes (pA) as a function of the semidifferentiation of time in seconds. Current was directly proportional to the concentration of each neurotransmitter according to the Cottrell Equation, which equates concentration of molecules oxidized with the amplitude of the oxidation peak which denotes electrochemical current. Logarithmic regression analysis indicated that the lowest detection limits for NE and 5-HT in vitro, approached 6 nmoles and 3 mnoles, respectively in the first preconcentration step (Broderick, 1989; Broderick, 1993; Broderick, 1997) . The current produced by the oxidation of NE within CA, region of hippocampus was detected in lo-15 seconds whereas that produced by 5-HT was detected in lo-12 seconds in each in vivo microvoltammetric scan. NE release and S-HT release, at each data point, represented a measurement in pA of NE and S-HT current within CA, region of hippocampus.

A series of infrared photobeams was encased in aluminum frames around the chamber's perimeter. When activated with an IBM computerized circuit, the infrared photobeams detected the animal's position in the behavioral chamber on an x-y axes positional basis. Thus, multiple concurrent measures of the animal's activity were simultaneously assayed. The specific activities of each animal assayed were: (1.) Ambulations (running-forward locomotion interacting with the maintenance of a horizontal position of the head without lateral turning (Teitelbaum et al., 1990) ), (2.) Rearing (maxima1 upward vertical movement of the head, without lateral turning (Teitelbaum et al., 1990) ). Ambulatory behavior is called anti-agoraphobic (anti-thigmotactic) behavior; the behavior indicates a reduced fear on the part of the animal (Geyer, 1990) ]. Mesolimbic 5-HT release has been shown to be closely temporally allied with natural open-field movement (Broderick and Phelix, 1997) . The status of the infrared photobeams was sampled every 100 msec. Our system is a modified version of an Activity statistically analyzed, using the same statistical tests, described above. Behavioral results are expressed as frequency of events. Each animal was used as its own control.

The present results show that the mechanism of action of the TBZD, adinazolam is dramatically different from that of the classical BZD, diazepam. Adinazolam increased 5-HT release within the CA, region of hippocampus while the animal is freely moving and behaving. This response was not at all like the response of the classical BZD, diazepam, which decreased 5-HT release within CA, region of hippocampus using the same freely moving paradigm. The present data support previous preclinical data which indicate that (a) the TBZD, adinazolam, acts through the monoamine, 5-HT (Tunnel and de Montigny, 1984) (b) the BZD, diazepam, decreased hippocampal 5-HT release, which was increased by movement in the X-Maze in the freely moving rat (Wright et al., 1992) and (c) the TBZD, alprazolam also increased CA, hippocampal 5-HT release (Broderick, 1997) . Furthermore, our results are consistent with the previous studies of Turmel and de Montigny (1984) in the sense that the TBZD, adinazolam, had different effects on 5-HT-ergic function than did the BZD, diazepam. In the Tunnel and de Montigny studies, diazepam did not induce 5-HT sensitization in neuronal firing within the same 5-HT somatodendrites in which adinazolam did induce 5-HT sensitization in neuronal tiring.",

The present results agree with these positive results, e.g., the report of potentiation of NE-induced enhancement of blood pressure (Sethy and Hodges, 1982) . The present data may lend explanation to previous discrepant preclinical data in the literature, about adinazolam, which directly conflict with the data from the clinical literature. To reiterate, the previous data reported that adinazolam was a weak inhibitor of NE reuptake at the synapse, in vitro, and adinazolam, when chronically administered, neither reduced rat cortex beta adrenergic receptor binding (Sethy and Harris, 1981) , nor sensitized rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons to microiontophoretically applied NE (Tunnel and de . Moreover, it appears that a notable difference occurs between the mechanism of action of the TBZD, adinazolam, versus that of the BZD, diazepam where NE is concerned. Whereas adinazolam initially increased NE release and then decreased NE release in CA, region of hippocampus in the freely moving and behaving rat, diazepam only decreased the in vivo electrochemical signal for NE. Moreover, the adinazolaminduced decrease in NE release was greater than the decrease in NE release produced by diazepam.",

Anesthetic effects of the TBZDs on 5-HT release are especially intriguing because in a similar series of studies from this laboratory, adinazolam did not produce increased 5-HT release in the CA, region of hippocampus in the chloral hydrate anesthetized animal after acute (single) injection (Broderick, 1991a) . Although adinazolam has been shown to be well tolerated in patients who must undergo surgery under general anesthesia (Othmer and Othmer, 1988) , the direct on-line effects of anesthesia on neurotransmitter function and release, during adinazolam treatment, deserves consideration. The lack of adinazolam's effect to modify dorsal raphe 5-HT neuronal firing after acute injection (Tunnel and de , might be dependent, in part, on anesthesia, since Aghajanian showed in 1978 that administration of 5-HT in nerve terminals, should suppress DR neuronal tiring. Moreover, BZDs did not alter the spontaneous firing rate of the DR, even though both systemic and iontophoretic administration of BZDs were found to potentiate the inhibitory effects produced by GABA on DR (Gallagher, 1978) . Nerve cell firing rates have previously been shown to be affected by anesthesia, particularly in the case of catecholamines (Kelland et al., 1989) . Therefore, anesthestic effects may well alter nerve cell firing rates, apriori, thereby masking the effects of adinazolam on 5-HT.",

In the presence of chloral hydrate, GBL, which is also an anesthetic, (Winters and Spooner, 1965) , neuronal 5-HT depolarization was blocked, thereby, decreasing S-HT release which is dependent on impulse flow. On the other hand, in the freely moving and behaving rat paradigm, when neuronal impulse flow was blocked by GBL, but chloral hydrate was not present, 5-HT release was not blocked (Broderick, 1992) ; these data suggest that GBL blocks inhibitory 5-HT autoreceptor mechanisms, which results in enhanced S-HT release.",

In contrast, diazepam's known anti-anxiety effect was masked by its sedative properties. The sedative effect produced by diazepam, even at low doses, is clearly more potent than that observed during adinazolam administration. The Behavioral Activity Patterns, which were derived from the same animals and at the same time as the in vivo electrochemical signals for NE release and 5-HT release were detected on-line, showed that the TBZD, adinazolam, produced a significant reduction in three of the four open-field behavioral parameters, at least in certain specific time periods.

Each data point represents the mean +/-SE of natural Ambulatory behavior (N=4) followed by mean +/-SE of changes in Ambulatory behavior produced by adinazolam (N=4; same animal control).

After the second injection of adinazolam (2 mg/kg), although photobeam interruptions increased from 3 I to 104, statistical significance did not occur in this half-hour. At the 90 minute mark, another series of reductions occurred, eventually resulting in an increase of 10 photobeam interruptions at the end of the time course study. Indeed, 50% of the animals exhibited dramatic increases in Ambulatory activities at time points 15 and 115 and consequently huger standard errors occurred. Notably, initial increases in Ambulatory activity are consistent with the increases in 5-HT release and the initial increase in NE release. Post hoc analysis showed that adinazolam significantly increased the frequency of Ambulations (Dunnett's Method: ~~0.05, q=3.412) in the first half-hour after adinazolam injection.The other three \"q\" values for the final three half-hours were not statistically significant over baseline;q=O.168, q=O.585, qzO.134. mFigure 4shows the effect of adinazolam (10 mgkg i.p., first hour, and an additional 2 mg/kg i.p., second hour) on the fr equency of Rearings; each animal had",

Behavioral chamber was novel to each animal; animals were habituated before adinazolam injection.5-HT release and NE release monitored on line, with in vivo microvoltammetry, and Ambulatory behavior was also concurrently recorded. Adinazolam did not significantly affect Rearing frequency (One Way ANOVA: ~~0.2605, F=l.42, df=4,23 (N=4) (equal variance)). However, Rearing frequency was increased in the first half-hour post-injection when Rearing events increased from a mean baseline value of 2 to a mean value of 8. Then, Rearing behavior dramatically decreased to mean values of 2, 4, and 3 respectively. However, similarly to the Ambulatory behavior exhibited post-adinazolam, there were spurts of increased Rearing behavior demonstrated throughout the 2 hour time course study, e.g. Rearing events numbered 12 at the 115 minute time point. Adinazolam did not significantly increase the Rearing frequency when the first and second hour, postadinazolam, are individually compared to the baseline (Kruskal-Wallis One Way ANOVA on Ranks: p= 0.3978, H = 1.84, df=2 (N=4) (unequal variance)).

Adinazolam significantly increased the frequency of Fine Movements (Stereotypy) (Kruskal-Wallis One Way ANOVA on Ranks: p=<O.O03, H = 16.0, df=4, (N=4) (unequal variance)). Stereotypic fine movement events increased from a mean of 1 (baseline) to a mean of 7, 6, 4 and 0 in the first half-hour, second half-hour, third half-hour, and fourth half-hour of study respectively. Q numbers derived from the post hoc test (Dunn's Method) showed that only the first half-hour effect was significant (~~~0.05, q=2.619). Adinazolam's dramatic effects on increased stereotypy (Fine Movements) were nine-fold in the first five minutes post-injection period, as photobeam interruptions went from a baseline of 2 photobeam interruptions to 18 photobeam interruptions.

Thus, adinazolam's anti-anxiety effect can be discerned in this paradigm.Thetransient increases and decreases in Central Ambulatory behavior are similar to the pattern of Ambulatory, Rearing, and stereotypic Fine Movement behavior, seen in Figs 3Time course studies showing the effect of adinazolam on Central Ambulatory behavior in freely moving and behaving male, Sprague Dawley rats.
