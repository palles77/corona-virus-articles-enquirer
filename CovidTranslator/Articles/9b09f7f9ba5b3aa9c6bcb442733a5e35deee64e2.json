Encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus was isolated from aborted fetuses and lungs of suckling pigs from three Quebec pig farms that experienced outbreaks of reproductive failure in sows and respiratory problems in suckling and post-weaning piglets. Multifocal interstitial pneumonia and mild non-suppurative myocarditis and meningoencephalitis were the more significant histopathological lesions observed in piglets. Vero cells were found to be more sensitive than BHK-21 cells and pig cell fines for primary isolation of EMC virus. The Quebec EMC virus isolates were highly virulent for mice and were antigenically related to reference strain of EMC virus as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence, seroneutralization and Western immunoblotting. Specific virus neutralization antibody titers up to 1:12,800 were detected in samples of thoracic or abdominal fluids of the aborted fetuses.",

The cytopathic changes were demonstrated only after inoculation with homogenates prepared from the lungs of two of the piglets and after inoculation with pooled tissues from one aborted fetus. After three successive passages, complete degeneration of the cell monolayers was obtained within 18 to 24 h after inoculation. No CPE were observed in cell cultures inoculated with homogenates of the spleen, heart, tonsils and brain of the necropsied piglets. Picornavirus-like particles were observed by negative stained electron microscopy (EM) in the concentrated (10 x ) supernatant fluids of degenerated cell cultures (Fig. 1 b) . No CPE could be demonstrated following two successive passages of the clinical specimens in BHK-21, but the three virus isolates that first propagated in Vero cells could be easily adapted in BHK-21 cells. Both cell lines were of comparable sensitivity in subsequent passages as evaluated by the relative extent of CPE and infectivity titers. With both cell lines, infectivity titers reached 107 to 10 7.6 TCIDs0/0.1 ml after three to four successive passages. Evidence of viral replication in pig cell lines (PFT, PK-15, ST) was not obtained after 3 weekly blind passages, as suggested by the absence of CPE, absence of hemagglutinating (HA) activity in supernatants when tested against chicken, rat and guinea pig erythrocytes, and absence of viral particles in cell extracts examined by EM. No viral particles could be observed by EM in the allantoic fluids of embryonating chicken eggs after two successive passages of the clinical samples, and no hemagglutinating activity was demonstrated with chicken erythrocytes.

The pathogenicity of Quebec EMC virus isolates was investigated in mice. Groups of five CD-1 mice, approximately 25 g weight, were inoculated intraperitoneally with 0.5 ml of infected cell culture supernatants (106 to 10 7 TCIDs0/ 0.1 ml) and observed at least twice daily. In cases of the three Quebec EMC virus isolates, 100% mortality was observed within 48 h post-inoculation. Death was sudden or after signs of illness including ruffled coat and convulsive periods.",

In the last two years, multiple episodes of undiagnosed reproductive failure in sows with severe systemic clinical manifestations have also been reported in intensive piggeries from more than 13 states in the U.S.A. [8, 10 , tl] and a nearly identical syndrome was noted in a Saskatchewan herd, where researchers proposed a possible involvement of a porcine cytomegalovirus~ [18] . EMC virus was also isolated from aborted fetuses in Minnesota and Iowa [11] . Although the clinical signs in pregnant sows and unweaned piglets observed in Quebec piggeries were compatible to what has been reported in these states and in Saskatchewan, the histopathology was different. Necropsied fetuses did not show typical gross and microscopic heart lesions previously reported from experimental and natural infection of newborn piglets with EMC virus [12] [13] [14] .",
