            "text": "When Robert Merton wrote about the sociology of science in the 1970s, the central task at hand was explaining how a set of social norms and practices yielded knowledge-what was different about science compared to the humanities and the professions (Merton, 1973) . John Ziman and others addressed what makes the methods of science produce ''reliable knowledge'' (Ziman, 1978) . This paper addresses a related, but somewhat different aspect of science-how reliable knowledge can be turned into social benefit, using genomics as a case in point. The value of a science commons-a pool of knowledge that is widely available at little or no cost-is the central focus. The zone of intersection between reliable knowledge and useful knowledge falls squarely into what the late Donald Stokes described as ''Pasteur's Quadrant,'' (1997) where research results both contribute insight into the workings of nature and at the same time find practical application.",

Science Commons works within current copyright and patent law to promote legal and technical mechanisms that remove barriers to sharing'' (Science Commons, 2005) .

I have no direct connection to the organization, and do not speak for it. ) The main approach in what follows is historical, using background on how the science commons functioned in genomics to illustrate the role of a commons in general.

            "text": "There is some fuzziness around the edges of what constitutes a science commons, and how it relates to ''the public domain.'' There can be variants of many terms marching under the banner of open science or public research. ''Open access,'' for example, can mean free access to view information, but not necessarily freedom to use it in all ways without restriction. The information in patents, for example, is openly available, but users may need to get permission or pay fees to use a patented invention (including some basic methods used in science). To some, open science means no one can fence it in. Access to information, say through ''viral'' licensing or copyleft, may be conditioned on agreeing not to restrict subsequent users. Information may also simply be put into the public domain for any and all subsequent uses, by deposit at a freely available public database, for example. I focus on this last meaning, with information available to all at low or no cost. But again, this may not mean completely unfettered use, as sequence information in GenBank may be covered by patent claims. Jensen and Murray, for example, noted that more than 4,000 human DNA sequences are subject to claims in US patents (Jensen & Murray, 2005) . Sometimes there are restrictions on use of information and materials in the science commons, but those restrictions must also impose low or no costs to subsequent users, or else that information has left the science commons (e.g., through subsequent patenting, copyright, or database protection). There is no bright line dividing the science commons from proprietary R&D, and indeed in the case of some sequences, materials, and methods in molecular biology, the expense associated with use of genomic information may depend more on licensing terms and practices than what is or is not patented-and one person's ''reasonable terms'' may be out of reach for some users.",

            "text": "The world of genomics is not a simple world. Some of the data shown below, for example, are drawn from a free public database, the DNA Patent Database at Georgetown University (DNA Patent Database, 2005) . That database is, in turn, drawn from the freely available US Patent and Trademark Database (USPTO Database, 2005) . But the search engine and database used to generate the DNA Patent Database are derived from an intermediate subscription database that is not widely or freely available, but available to subscribers at several thousand dollars a year, through the Delphion patent database (Delphion Database, 2005) . Duke pays a subscription to The Thomson Corporation for its use. This is a major tool for our research, and for us the subscription cost is balanced by ease of use and reliability. We pay for Delphion for its special features (such as corporate trees that track ownership of patents) and because its search results have proven more reliable than several alternatives, including the USPTO's own computers and software available in northern Virginia. We are happy to pay for a proprietary database because it helps us do our work and the price is reasonable, within reach of our nonprofit institution. Delphion does not restrict our use, and does not prevent our creating a free public database. I raise the example of a pay-for-use database sandwiched between two public resource databases to hint that the story will get complicated, and to signal early that this is not a diatribe against for-profit intrusions into research. This is important because many of the points that come out later will seem unfriendly to purveyors of databases. Those objections are not deep-seated rejections of capitalism in science, but rather pragmatic judgments about adverse effects of particular policies.",

            "text": "Innovation is exquisitely sensitive to policies of many kinds. Innovation depends on how much information is produced as well as how widely and easily it is shared. Funding of R&D is a major determinant of how much research is conducted, and thereby how much information is created. Policies governing the science commons-or alternative, more restricted informational spaces-determine how widely and quickly information and materials are distributed. My purpose here is to highlight why the science commons matters. Some reasons are obvious, but some are not so obvious, and some are even counterintuitive.One final conceptual point will be helpful to flag before proceeding into the narrative. There is extensive overlap between ''academic health research'' and the science commons in molecular biology. Academic science is important in many fields, not just the life sciences. In all lines of scientific and technical work, universities and nonprofit research institutions and government laboratories (''academic research institutions'') play key roles. Everyone is trained in academe, not just academic scientists, but also those working in industry. And within industry, academic training is not just for those doing R&D, but also managers and professionals. Academe is also one place where the norms of Mertonian science have real traction, where the norms of openness, community, mutual criticism, and fair allocation of credit are supposed to be respected, at least as an ideal. In some circumstances, however, academic science is done under strictures of secrecy, or results are made available only at great cost or encumbered by restrictions on use. Such academic science is not part of a science commons. Great science goes on in industry, including or even particularly in the life sciences, but no one expects the norms of openness to prevail in industrial R&D, even if in some circumstances at some times scientists in companies publish in the open literature, present their findings at open scientific conferences, make materials freely available, and contribute data to public databases. When industrial R&D is widely shared openly, results flowing from industrial R&D can become part of the science commons, and there are several instances of this in the stories to follow. In sum, most academic research contributes to the science commons, and some industrial R&D also does so. Most industrial R&D is proprietary, as is some academic research.",

Policies put in place over the past three decades have raised concerns about how big the science commons will be, and in particular, whether and to what degree government and nonprofit funders and academic research institutions will maintain it. Richard Nelson of Columbia University, in particular, has expressed concerns about intrusions on open science, based on his decades of studying the innovation process as an economist (Nelson, 2006) .",

Academic institutions began to patent much more frequently after 1980, and genomics is one of the areas where this effect was pronounced. Moreover, patent rights were being expanded and strengthened in many areas of American law, including biotechnology. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) was formed in 1982. It was designed to handle appeals of certain cases, including appeals of federal district court decisions about patent litigation. The CAFC quickly established itself as a generally propatent court. It and the patent office expanded the kinds of inventions that could be patented (including software and business methods, for example) and tended to strengthen the hand of patent-holders relative to those contesting patent rights (Jaffe & Lerner, 2005) . In the hands of the CAFC, more territory could be enclosed and patent fences generally got higher. These developments had a particularly strong impact on areas of rapid innovation, including both ''wet lab'' biotechnology and bioinformatics, fields directly relevant to genomics.",

The question was whether the methods TIGR had used on smaller genomes, such as bacteria, could work on the human genome, and produce a final sequence faster than the public genome project.

A set of ''Bermuda Rules'' emerged from the meeting, mandating daily disclosure of DNA sequence data.

Haseltine argued government funds for DNA sequencing would be better spent on smaller projects in individual laboratories to understand gene sequences. There were two problems with this argument. First, it assumed almost all the value of sequencing came from gene sequences, whereas molecular genetics has become focused on many regulatory processes that happen at the RNA and DNA level and are never translated into protein. It seems a safe bet that a lot of biology would never be approachable if we only got protein-coding sequences. Haseltine is an excellent scientist and knew this full well, although for commercial purposes, he could certainly make a good case that the most rapid returns were likely to come from coding sequences. This argument conflated commercial value with scientific value, but as an argument about public support for science, it is simply wrong, as the complexity of gene regulation is becoming obvious, and the importance of DNA sequences in addition to protein-coding regions is becoming apparent. Gene-based strategies made eminently good sense when hunting for drug targets, because drugs are designed to interact with proteins that are secreted outside of cells, that bind DNA, or that extend outward from the surface of cells.

The fact that genes were being sequenced by companies did no one but those companies any good if the sequences were not public. Academic scientists could, of course, approach HGSI or Incyte or other companies to collaborate, getting access to their data, but relatively few did so. The reason was that such collaboration came with strings-or ropes, or even cables. The constraints were patent rights-that is, exclusive property rights that were routinely being granted for full-length genes by the US Patent and Trademark Office. Collaboration with HGSI or Incyte meant nondisclosure agreements, publication review, and rights on resulting intellectual property. Sometimes this made sense, but it was not terribly attractive for those mainly interested in advancing science. A central condition of collaboration was control of information and constraints on open sharing of data. It made sense in a business context, but as a public works project in science, it made none. And to argue that proprietary gene sequencing was a substitute for public funding of genomic sequencing was ridiculous. Scientists could of course wait for patents to issue from privately sequenced genes, but that was not really a practical option because of the many-year delay. Perhaps scientists could hope HGSI and Incyte would publish the sequences voluntarily someday, but the companies would do that only when patents issued, or if it suited their business needs. The companies did publish, but only very selectively. To academic scientists in the field, waiting for companies to do the work would be surrendering to the competition in any event.",

GenBank and other databases received sequences from thousands of laboratories throughout the world, as well as (eventually) the output of major DNA sequencing centers. Incyte and HGSI drew regularly on GenBank data, but company gene sequence data made their way back to public sequence databases only when a patent issued, or if the company chose to publish an article in the scientific literature. 3 In effect, company projects built on the foundation laid by the public genome project and drew regularly upon its data, but only occasionally contributed data back to public databases.

First, the offer would likely have been refused by the companies, because their business plan was precisely to keep sequence data proprietary until they could be patented. Government procurement of the data would have vitiated this business plan, and turned the companies into contractors. The second reason was price. It would have been embarrassingly high, and certainly would have undercut the argument the work could be done ''with no tax dollars.''

By the time the initial genomic sequence publications came out, the ratio of private to public 3 After November 1999, a US patent application was published 18 months after being filed, if the applicant sought patent rights in any country with an 18-month publication rule. The companies did also publish occasionally in the scientific literature. HGSI, for example, listed 70 publications with one or more HGSI authors as of March 2005 on its website. These publications sometimes included sequence data, and if so, would make their way to GenBank, often before publication of the corresponding patent or patent application. These data make three simple points: First, the private sector has invested heavily in genomics, but those investments are made in expectation of financial return. That is quite different from the public and nonprofit funding of genomics, which is mainly intended to produce public goods-knowledge and materials that are widely available to advance knowledge and combat disease. Second, private R&D investment is a powerful complement to the public and nonprofit funding. Private R&D follows public R&D in time, it draws on the science commons but does not necessarily contribute back to it. If successful, private R&D investment can create wealth and jobs as well as the social benefit from developing goods and services that would otherwise not be produced. This benefit is real, but it is distinct from the social value of the science commons.",

            "text": "To see why having a healthy science commons matters, we move away from genomics to make a general point about health research. Murphy and Topel estimated that the gains in life expectancy from medical research 1970 to 1990 were staggering-in the range of $2.8 trillion per year ($1.5 trillion of this from cardiovascular disease reduction alone) (Murphy & Topel, 1999) . Many of the health benefits of discovering new information about health and disease come not from drugs or vaccines or medical services, but from individuals acting on information. Cutler and Kadiyala attributed 2/3 of the health gains in cardiovascular disease reduction to effects of ''public information,'' such as stopping or reducing tobacco use, changing diet, getting more exercise, or monitoring one's blood pressure. The second largest determinant was technological change, such as introduction of new drugs and services, followed by increasing cigarette taxes to reduce tobacco use (Cutler & Kadiyala, 2001 ). The estimated return on investment in medical treatment was 4-1, but on the ''public information'' it was 30-1. Cutler and Kadiyala's result cannot be generalized, because smoking is a very large risk factor that is sui generis, and cardiovascular disease has proven far more malleable to many kinds of interventions than nonlung cancer and other chronic diseases. The path from scientific understanding of cause to prevention of cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease, among others, appears far less linear, and so the value of public information about risk is correspondingly less powerful and has less impact on health outcomes. Few if any risk factors will ever be found to rival tobacco use as predictors of poor health. But the finding that information can have value irrespective of being translated into products and services in a paying market is nonetheless important. Even if public information will not be quite as powerful in reducing other chronic diseases as it has been for cardiovascular disease, the vector is likely to point in the same direction. We cannot say that public information will always prove more powerful than information channeled into new drugs, vaccines, biologics, devices, and medical services sold for profit in the health care system. Where there are public health benefits from public research results, however-and the probability there will be no such public health effects of genomics seems vanishingly small-the health science commons is essential, because it alone can supply the public information benefits. Both words in ''public information'' do a lot of work. We need new information that arises from science, but to capture social benefits based on that knowledge itself, we also need it to be public.",

The 2002 report from the World Health Organization, Genomics and World Health gave the example of fosmidomycin (Advisory Committee on Health Research, 2002) . This drug is currently being testing to treat malaria in Africa (Missinou et al., 2002) . That use came to light as a consequence of sequencing the genome of the malaria parasite, and noticing a metabolic pathway not previously known to exist. The compound fosmidomycin was known to inhibit the pathway, and had been The science commons in health research 145 developed as a treatment for urinary tract infections. When the new possible use to treat malaria was revealed, fosmidomycin was pulled off the shelf and moved into clinical trials against malaria. This is a treatment that may never turn a profit for any company, but the social returns could be enormous if fosmidomycin works, because so many millions of people are infected with malaria. If not fosmidomycin, then perhaps other findings will lead to prevention or treatment of malaria, enabled by now having the full genomic sequence available for host, pathogen, and mosquito vector (Gardner et al., 2002; Holt et al., 2002) . Making the information about these organisms available worldwide is essential to accruing the benefits of research. There is only a weak world market for drugs to treat malaria because it is largely an affliction in resource-poor populations. The usual profit motives of the intellectual property system cannot create incentives where there is no prospect of profit to pull products through an expensive discovery and testing process. But networks of nonprofit organizations, such as the Malaria Vaccine Initiative, the Global Fund, the WHO essential medicines program, and other sources of ''public'' capital might nonetheless be capable of discovering and developing new treatments despite the unlikely prospect of commercial profit. 5 In theory, public funds might induce a sufficient incentive to motivate profit-driven investments for diseases of poor people living in poor countries, but it is not true now, and betting that money will be found could prove wrong. Having a scientific commons with information relevant to vaccines and treatments at least offers an alternative pathway. Many of the scientists most motivated to study such diseases work in resource-poor countries; they do not have rich resources, but they do have strong motivation, as well as computers and access to public databases. Another case example is SARS. Strains of the coronavirus that causes SARS were identified and sequenced within a month by at least three laboratories in Asia, Canada, and the United States. That sequence information was shared widely, and a ''chip'' to detect the virus was available for research and possible clinical use just a few months later. Making progress with such alacrity requires strong norms of open science, with obvious social benefit. 6 Many of the infectious diseases that plague mankind have long eluded measures to combat them. In many cases, this is because they are difficult to grow in tissue culture, and therefore research progress is slow. With new technology, the genomes of hundreds of ''nasty bugs'' have been fully sequenced, giving scientists an entirely new tool to develop drugs, vaccines, and control measures. It is far from clear that this will tilt the battle decisively in favor of humans over schistosomes, trypanosomes, plasmodia, bacteria, viruses, and other organisms that maim and kill humans by the billions, but it is a new line of attack. In the case of organisms on the Select Agent list of ''bioterror'' bugs, there is now extensive research underway to develop 5 My colleagues Anthony So, Arti Rai, Jerry Reichman, Henry Grabowski, and others at Duke have joined many others from around the world to seek creative ways to ensure that essential drugs and vaccines are developed. 6 This story of sharing sequence information is commingled with a potential intellectual property story that could be complicated. At least three of the institutions that did the sequencing have applied for patents, and interference proceedings could be complex, as they are in different countries and on different strains that might need to be cross-licensed for many practical applications. A patent pool could emerge, or a monster interference proceeding to sort out the questions of inventorship. The preventive and treatment measures. For most infectious agents that afflict those in the poorest parts of the world, however, the prospect of profit will not create a demand-pull for innovation that could improve billions of human lives, unless indirect incentives such as prizes or guaranteed payments for effective remedies by third parties serve as surrogates for paying markets.",

The decision not to sequence protein-coding regions was initially about fairness between big labs and small ones, not about commercial prospects. As the genome project took shape, the importance of maps of humans and various ''model organisms'' was apparent. What kinds of maps deserved substantial funding and concerted effort remained, however, a matter of ongoing dispute. One of the bones of contention was a ''gene map'' based on cDNA technology-that is, making DNA copies of the messenger RNA translated into protein within cells. Construction of cDNA libraries was standard fare, and remains a seminal technology in efforts to study expression of many genes through microarray technologies.",

A technical means to isolate the RNA that is translated into proteins was readily available. DNA could be made from such RNA molecules. This was called cDNA technology, ''complementary'' to the messenger RNA that is exported from the nucleus of the cell to its cytoplasm to be translated into protein. In fact, one could take it a step further and look for genes coding proteins likely to be of particular biological significance-and focus on just those cDNAs coding for secreted proteins and peptides (such as hormones or neurotransmitters), for receptor or transporter molecules extending outside the cell (with many trans-membrane domains), or proteins that bind DNA (with ''zinc fingers), etc. These ''functional motifs'' could be predicted, if imperfectly, from DNA sequence data. One logical strategy to start the DNA sequencing program was to sequence cDNAs of particular interest first, then other cDNAs, and then turn to ''genomic'' DNA between genes. (DNA between genes would still be of interest because such sequences were likely to house regulatory signals for turning genes on and off, and affecting the timing of gene expression, as well as structures involved in cell division and the 3-dimensional shape of DNA in cells.)",

When the congressional Office of Technology Assessment presented a plausible budget for funding the genome project, it included a cDNA sequencing component (US Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, 1988 ). The Department of Energy did pursue some cDNA sequencing, but NIH's genome program did not. It was a matter of some discussion, but in the end it was largely James Watson's call, as director of the relevant NIH center. Several arguments were made against cDNA sequencing. First, it was already going to happen, since incentives to find genes were strong with funding from other NIH institutes, but incentives for individual labs to produce whole genomic sequence data were entirely dependent on ''genome project'' funding. Another, related, argument was about the sociology of science-if big sequencing centers did cDNA sequencing, they would inevitably also be at least tempted to pause to characterize particularly interesting genes, and turn to the fascinating biology sure to follow. There were two problems with this: (1) it would distract them from the major task at hand of deriving a complete reference sequence of the entire genome, and (2) it would give them an unfair advantage over the thousands of smaller laboratories lacking the DNA sequencing firepower.",

If Merck paid for it as corporate R&D, it could deduct the R&D as an expense, but would also have to justify public domain science at stockholder expense. Through a nonprofit arm, Merck funded great science, burnished Merck's image, and enhanced Merck's future freedom to operate cleanly, without having to appropriate any returns on an ''investment.'

During the late 1990s, it became apparent that there were many single-base-pair differences in DNA sequence among individuals.

This raised the prospect of needing to get licenses on hundreds or even thousands of SNP sequences from some unknown (but potentially large) number of patent owners. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had instructed the patent office that the ''nonobvious'' criterion for DNA sequence was met by any new DNA sequence, so ''obvious'' did not mean ''obvious how to find it'' but ''sequence determined and in hand.''

There was, in effect, just one major, central DNA sequence database beginning in the early 1980s.

The databases contain many errors (Pennissi, 1999) , and creating financial incentives sufficient to encourage careful curation and maintenance is one reason to support proprietary rights in making databases.

Elliston, Associate Director, Bioinformatics, of the Merck Research Laboratories. Dr. Greg Lennon's laboratory at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Livermore, California) has been supplying arrayed cDNA clones to Dr. Robert Waterston's laboratory (the Genome Sequencing Center) at the Washington University School of Medicine (St. Louis, Missouri) for sequencing. The sequence data are being submitted to the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) division of GenBank on a regular basis for immediate distribution. [GenBank, built and distributed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is a central repository of publicly-available gene sequence information, widely known and heavily used by researchers in government, academe, and industry]''.Acknowledgments Suparna Salil and Ilse Wiechers edited and helped format citations and references.
