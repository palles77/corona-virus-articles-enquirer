In this study, we investigated the effects of PEDV infection on the cell cycle of Vero cells and p53 activation. The results demonstrated that PEDV infection induces cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in Vero cells, while UV-inactivated PEDV does not cause cell cycle arrest. PEDV infection up-regulates the levels of p21, cdc2, cdk2, cdk4, Cyclin A protein and down-regulates Cyclin E protein. Further research results showed that inhibition of p53 signaling pathway can reverse the cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase induced by PEDV infection and cancel out the up-regulation of p21 and corresponding Cyclin/cdk mentioned above. In addition, PEDV infection of the cells synchronized in various stages of cell cycle showed that viral subgenomic RNA and virus titer were higher in the cells released from G0/G1 phase synchronized cells than that in the cells released from the G1/S phase and G2/M phase synchronized or asynchronous cells after 18 h p.i.. This is the first report to demonstrate that the p53-dependent pathway plays an important role in PEDV induced cell cycle arrest and beneficially contributes to viral infection.",

            "text": "The cell cycle can be divided into a number of separate events (Pines, 1999) : DNA replication (S phase), nuclear division (mitosis [M] ), and cell division (cytokinesis), separated by two gap periods (G1 and G2). Quiescent cells are described as being in G0. Progression in each phase of the cycle and from one phase to the next is tightly regulated and highly orchestrated, controlled by cyclins and cyclindependent kinases as well as other factors. In the G1 phase, cells express three kinds of Cyclin D (cyclin D1, D2 and D3), combining with and activating cdk4/6, which is necessary for cells to enter the G1 phase from G0 phase (Besson et al., 2008) . Cyclin E is also expressed in the G1 phase, which combines with cdk2 to make the cells complete the G1/S phase transition. The forward progression of S phase requires the kinase complex formed by cyclin A and cdk2 (Duronio, 2012) . At the late stage of G2 and early M, the combination of Cyclin A and cdk1 (cdc2) initiate cells into M phase (Enomoto et al., 2009) . It has been shown that these cell cycle regulatory molecules are regulated by some upstream pathways, such as p53 signaling. p53 monitors genome integrity during cell cycle G1/S and G2/M. If cell DNA is damaged, the cells are arrested in the G1 phase and cannot enter the S phase, or the cells are stagnated in the G2 phase and cannot enter the M phase, p53 is able to bind to the damaged DNA and promote its Repair (Schlereth et al., 2010) . p21 is the down-stream signaling molecule of tumor suppressor gene p53, because the promoter of p21 gene contains p53 binding domain, so p53 can activate p21 gene by transcription (Roy et al., 2009) . p21 can extensively act on cdk-Cyclin complexes and inhibit their activity, especially G1 phase cdk4/6-Cyclin D complexes (Starostina and Kipreos, 2011) . In the present study, we investigated the effects of PEDV replication on the cell cycle progression, the roles of p53 signaling activation in regulation of cell cycle progression in PEDV-infected cells, and the significance of cell cycle regulation in PEDV replication. The results showed that PEDV infection may affect the cell cycle and promote replication of viral genes.",

In this study, we first confirmed that cells infected with 0.5 MOI PEDV for 24 h did not produce syncytia, and then investigated whether PEDV replication has an effect on Vero cell cycle progress. The results showed that PEDV replication induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. To further confirm this cell cycle arrest, PEDV infection following serum starvation in which cells were synchronized in G0/G1 phase showed that cell cycle arrest was still in G0/G1 phase as the same result of asynchronous infection.

In G0 phase, pRb is nonphosphorylated but sequentially hypophosphorylated by Cyclin D-cdk4/6 complexes in early G1 and hyperphosphorylated by cyclin E-cdk2 complex in late G1 (Lundberg and Weinberg, 1998) . A Cyclin E expression change can change Cyclin E-cdk2 activity and a cyclin D expression change can change Cyclin D-cdk4/6 activity, consequently altering the cell cycle transition from G0/G1 phase to S phase (Weinberg, 1995) . In S phase, Cyclin A-cdk2 complex activity is required for S phase transition and DNA replication control (Elledge, 1996) . In G2 phase, Cyclin B-cdk1 complex activity is associated with mitosis (Besson et al., 2008) . In PEDV-infected cells, we observed significant increases of cdc2, cdk2, cdk4, Cyclin A and a decrease of Cyclin E involved in G0/G1 phase transition, consequently causing the G0/G1 phase arrest. p53 modulation is a key event in various viruses' replication and the induction of cell cycle arrest in virus-infected cells, such as H1N1 and TGEV (He et al., 2010; Ding et al., 2013) . But in this study, authors demonstrate that infection with coronavirus IBV induced cell cycle arrest was catalyzed by the modulation of various cell cycle regulatory genes and the accumulation of hypophosphorylated RB, but was independent of p53 (Li et al., 2007) . The role of p53 as an antiviral target for coronavirus proteases to avoid innate immune response, such as PLP2, a catalytic domain of the nonstructural protein 3 of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), by promoting p53 degradation, PLP2 inhibits the p53-mediated antiviral response and apoptosis to ensure viral growth in infected cells (Yuan et al., 2015) , SARS-CoV antagonize the viral inhibitor p53 via stabilizing CHY zinc-finger domain-containing 1 (RCHY1) and promoting RCHY1-mediated p53 degradation (Ma-Lauer et al., 2016) . As a DNA damage response protein, p53 is involved in transcriptional activation of various genes involved in DNA repair and cell cycle arrest (Vogelstein et al., 2000) , including p21 gene, After 1 h of virus adsorption, medium containing 10% FBS was added to the cells. At the indicated times, cells were co-stained with BrdU and PI and analyzed by FACS analysis. The data are from one of three experiments. The histograms were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism 7.0 software to determine the percentage of cells at each phase. The results are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 versus mock infection. whose product is a cdk inhibitor that negatively suppresses the formation of the Cyclin E-cdk2 complex, which is important for G1/S transition. Thus, it is possible that PEDV-induced G0/G1 phase arrest is caused by p53 expression up-regulation and its downstream influence, including p21 expression alteration. In this study, Western blot and Real-time quantitative PCR showed that PEDV infection induced p53",

It's observed that PEDV-induced G0/G1 phase arrest in Vero cells virtually required the possible involvement of p53. It is known that Fig. 6 . Western blot analysis of total cellular protein isolated from mock (M) and 0.5 MOI PEDV-infected (V). Vero cells at 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h p.i. were lysed and equal amounts of proteins from the samples were tested by western blot analysis. The same membranes were also probed with \u03b2-actin as a loading control. The numbers below the proteins indicated the relative folds of mock infection after normalized to \u03b2-actin. some viruses can regulate cell cycle progression through virus-cell interactions, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest and providing a favorable environment for viral replication (Dove et al., 2006; Ding et al., 2013) . For example, TGEV, a coronavirus which can induce cell cycle arrest in a p53 dependent way, could increase protein accumulation and progeny virus production in cells enriched in both S and G2/M phases of cell cycle (Ding et al., 2013) . PEDV and TGEV not only are coronavirus, but also induce cell cycle arrest in a p53 dependent way. In order to find out the biological significance of PEDV-induced cell cycle arrest and whether PEDV could increase protein accumulation and progeny virus production in cells enriched in G0/G1 phase similar to TGEV, we synchronized cells in various stages of cell cycle and compared their virus Vero cells were pretreated with DMSO or PFT-\u03b1 (10 \u03bcM) for 1 h and then infected with PEDV (0.5 MOI) for 1 h. After removal of the inoculum, the cells were continuously treated with DMSO or 10 \u03bcM PFT-\u03b1 for 12 and 24 h. The relative PEDV genes mRNA levels were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), the titers of PEDV were detected by TCID 50 .

The experiment was performed three. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 versus mock infection. infection efficiencies. The results showed that PEDV sgmRNA synthesis were greater and PEDV titer was higher in the cells released from G0/ G1 phase after 18 h p.i., when compared to either cells released from the S phase, G2/M phase or asynchronous cells. One possibility is that cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase provides increased amounts of ribonucleotide pool for efficient PEDV RNA synthesis. Since ribonucleotides are the precursors for synthesizing deoxyribonucleotides, a reduction in cellular DNA synthesis most likely increases the level of ribonucleotide pool in cells. Cell cycle arrest may also benefit PEDV replication in some other ways. Therefore, we favor the hypothesis that PEDV induces G0/ G1 phase cell cycle arrest in order to provide a more favorable condition for virus production.",

The G0/G1 phase arrest got reversed when p53 signaling pathway was inhibited, suggesting that PEDV through p53-dependent pathway causes cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, though more studies are required to verify whether or not this cell cycle arrest is cell type dependent. Moreover, the cell cycle arrest induced by PEDV infection might provide a more favorable condition for viral replication, since the cells released from G0/G1 phase were advantageous for PEDV replication.
