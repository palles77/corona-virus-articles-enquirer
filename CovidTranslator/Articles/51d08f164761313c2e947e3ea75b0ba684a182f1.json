            "text": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia accounting for nearly one-third of all leukemias [1, 2] . Almost all cases of CLL occur in adults 50 and over with a median age at diagnosis in the mid-60's [2, 3] . Median survival is 4-5 years after initiation of treatment, but early-stage patients often do not require treatment for many years after diagnosis [1] . Both the underlying CLL and its treatment result in immune compromise, particularly poor antibody responses, and infection is common [1, 4] . The most common infections in CLL patients are acute respiratory infections (ARIs) [4] . Many of these ARIs are viral, but antibiotics are frequently prescribed since it is difficult to differentiate viral from bacterial infection. The rate of major infection, i.e. infection severe enough to require hospitalization or treatment with parenteral antibiotics, is 0.04, 0.06, and 0.14 per patient per month in patients being treated with chlorambucil, fludarabine or the combination, respectively [3] . Untreated CLL patients are more prone to infection than similar age patients with non-malignant co-morbidity (ie. myocardial infarction) based on data published over 30 years ago [5] , but there are no more recent data, and those data included patients with a mix of CLL stages. Since the vast majority of CLL patients are over age 60, it is likely that immune senescence, the waning of immunity with advanced age, is also a risk factor for infection [6] . Recent studies [7] suggest the mean number of ARI days during the respiratory illness winter season within this age group is about 8 [7] .",

Infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been used in subjects with low serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) (< 500 mg/dl). However, IVIG use is controversial due to supply issues, lack of consensus on frequency of administration or dose, and questionable cost-effectiveness of this very expensive therapy (approximately $11,000,000/quality-adjusted life year gained) [2] . Prophylactic antibiotics are much less expensive, but this strategy likely enhances antimicrobial resistance, has poor compliance, and prophylaxis for common viral pathogens is not available [1] [2] [3] [4] . Thus there is a pressing need for effective, low-cost interventions that enhance immunity, reduce infection risk and limit antibiotic use in CLL patients.",

The accumulated data on the mechanism of action indicates that CVT-E002 is an innate immune modulator, acting through toll-like receptors on the surfaces of these cells. This activation leads to increased numbers and function of cells within both the innate and adaptive immune systems [8] [9] [10] [11] . CVT-E002 reduces the incidence of ARIs in adults [7, [12] [13] [14] . Importantly, three of these studies [7, 12, 14] were performed in older adults, the population most affected by CLL. One study in healthy, community-dwelling seniors showed CVT-E002 reduced the number of days with respiratory illness symptoms by over 50% [12] . Another study was conducted in long-term care (nursing home) residents [7] with the main endpoint being laboratory-confirmed symptomatic influenza; 7/101 placebo recipients had confirmed influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) illness vs. only 1/97 CVT-E002 recipients (p = 0.033). In the third study, conducted in 783 community-dwelling seniors [14] , incidence of respiratory illness was decreased by one-third in the CVT-E002 recipients (p = 0.04).",

Also, the characteristics of long-term care residents: older age, multiple co-morbidities, and impaired immunity including ineffective vaccine responses, closely resemble the population and immune milieu of CLL patients. Based on these parallels and the need for effective preventive measures for ARI in CLL patients, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of CVT-E002 to reduce ARI and the need for antibiotic treatment in CLL patients.",

This is the first study in CLL subjects; the safety and tolerability of CVT-E002 was again evident in this trial with no difference vs. placebo recipients. However, there was no effect on ARI illness days or antibiotic use, the a prioridefined endpoints. The lack of efficacy for reaching ARI endpoints in CLL patients could be due to multiple factors. The accumulated data on the mechanism of CVT-E002 indicates that CVT-E002 is an innate immune modulator, acting through toll-like receptors on the surfaces of these cells. This activation leads to increased numbers and function of cells within both the innate and adaptive immune systems [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, there is no current method to measure blood/tissue levels of the \"active compound\" nor a measurable bioassay to allow a correlation of outcome with evidence of drug effect. It is possible that these pathways are not sufficiently influenced by CVT-E002 at the dose utilized to demonstrate clinical benefit in CLL patients, or that the toll-like receptor pathway is impaired in CLL patients. However, the results regarding seroconversion suggest otherwise (see below) and indicate that further study of higher doses of CVT-E002 is warranted. In addition, it is worth noting that the variability in the symptom-defined measures was far greater than that seen in previous studies in non-leukemic participants, which may have contributed to the failure to reach significance.",

Increased viral exposure risk in CVT-E002 recipients seems very unlikely. Further an increased risk for viral infection is not consistent with the clinical data that show a trend toward lower incidence of moderately-severe ARI in CVT-E002 recipients. The seroconversion data are much more consistent with enhanced immune responses as a result of CVT-E002 therapy. Sensitivity for detecting seroconversion rests on documenting a 4fold rise in titer. CLL patients generally have impaired antibody responses [1, [3] [4] [5] .

            "text": "In summary, ARI is a common complication in patients with untreated CLL with an average of one day in every ten being an ARI day during the winter respiratory virus season. CVT-E002 was well-tolerated, but did not reduce the number of ARI days, severe ARI days, the two a priori primary endpoint, or antibiotic use. CVT-E002 therapy, however, was associated with trends toward a reduced rate of more intense ARI and a significant reduction in the percent of subjects reporting moderately-severe sore throat, any moderate-severe symptom, or grade \u22653 toxicity. A significant increase in the rate of seroconversion vs. respiratory viral pathogens in CVT-E002 recipients most likely reflects augmented antibody responses. Future research should examine whether CVT-E002 can affect antibody titers after immunization in CLL patients, and whether higher doses of CVT-E002 might effectively reduce ARI incidence and severity. CONSORT diagram of subjects enrolled in the study. Respiratory illness symptoms reported as moderate-severe. The percent of subjects in each group reporting moderate-severe acute respiratory illness symptoms (worst reported severity Jan-Mar) is shown. Number of subjects experiencing a seroconversion (\u2265 4-fold rise in antibody titer) vs. nine common respiratory viruses during the entire study period; 191 subjects had serum samples available both at baseline and end-of-study and were thus included in the analysis. Totals are given both as proportion of subjects in each group experiencing seroconversion/cold season and, since individuals could seroconvert to > one virus, the rate of seroconversions/cold season by group is also shown.
