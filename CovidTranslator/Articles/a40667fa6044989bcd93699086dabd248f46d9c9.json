            "text": "When designing and building a commercial information system, the elucidation of functional requirements is a first step in the process, and it is a prerequisite for subsequent steps. If the information system is an early warning system for missile attack, for example, the functional requirements might prominently feature the detection of the attack within several minutes of launch. In the case of a biosurveillance system for an aerosol release of anthrax, the functional requirements might similarly emphasize detection as quickly as possible, but no later than within days of release. Although a biosurveillance system is fundamentally an information system, the process of functional-requirement specification is often less rigorous than in the commercial world. Even when organizations develop functional requirements (e.g., for an electronic disease reporting system), the requirements do not specify how quickly an outbreak of disease must be detected, rather they are formulated in terms of the data that should be collected, the properties of the user interface, and system security. The functional requirements of the Public Health Information Network (PHIN) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are an example of current functional requirement specifications (www.cdc.gov/phin). To our knowledge, no organization has published functional requirements derived from explicit consideration of timeliness requirements for specific diseases. System designers have been let off the hook, so to speak, by their customers for this--arguably, the most difficult-requirement. The two published analyses that considered timeliness requirements were partial analyses: one analyzed gaps in current biosurveillance systems (Dato et al., 2001) , and the second analyzed the data requirements for earlier detection (Wagner et al., 2001b) .",

The Sverdlovsk outbreak was a result of accidental release of anthrax spores into the air. Unknown individuals used envelopes containing anthrax spores to carry out the U.S. postal attacks. Kaufmann et al. (1997) analyzed the available information from the Sverdlovsk outbreak and information about the disease anthrax. They demonstrated that the requirement for timeliness of detection of an aerosol release of anthrax is ideally the moment of release, but no later than 5 days after release. Wagner et al. (2003b) used a taxonomy of surveillance data depicted in Table 4 .1 to identify the types of surveillance data that might be available in this time window. They concluded that the system specifications for a biosurveillance system capable of meeting the time requirement would include components to obtain and process data from biosensors, preclinical data sources (e.g., sales of cough syrup), and early clinical data (e.g., symptoms and radiological reports). A system would have to collect and analyze these data in near real time with attention to corroborating and discriminating data from other sources, such as wind patterns and physical location of individuals in the days preceding onset of illness. They concluded that conventionally trained physicians could not be relied on to detect an outbreak of this type. In the Sverdlovsk outbreak, the earliest suspicion of anthrax came from an autopsy finding of a cardinal's cap (hemorrhagic meningitis, a pathognomonic finding for the disease anthrax) on the eighth day after the release (Abramova et al., 1993) , by which time 14 individuals had died (Guillemin, 2001) . At least six victims had their early symptoms dismissed by physicians as not serious, and 21 individuals had died by the time that the laboratory confirmation of anthrax was broadcast to area hospitals on the 10th day after the accidental release (Guillemin, 2001) . TAB L E 4.1 Taxonomy of Surveillance Data 9 Preoutbreak data: This category refers to data obtained during the period before the onset of the outbreak. Examples of data that might contribute to detection include intelligence that heightens suspicion or host factors such as vaccinations that determine susceptibility. 9 Attack, release, or exposure data refers to data obtained at or very near the time of an accidental of intentional contamination. Data from this time might come from biosensor arrays, unauthorized airplane flights, or other activities.",

Specifically, a building or vessel contamination refers to the distribution of anthrax (or other agent) via the mechanical components in a building or ship. This is a serious threat because of our modern reliance on heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems, which can effectively disseminate spores throughout a building. The functional requirement for time of detection is similar to that of an outdoor release because many individuals would be exposed simultaneously. Recognition of a release contained within a structure, however, produces somewhat different requirements. Specifically, the requirement is the detection of a cluster of illnesses common to a relatively small number of individuals sharing a domicile, a place of employment, or a social facility. This detection requires recognition and analysis of these relationships. A detection system ideally would have access to data about heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems, identity of occupants, and hours of occupation. The building contamination with B. anthracis of a postal facility in New Jersey during the 2001 postal attack is an interesting example for study (Greene et al., 2002) .

The functional requirement here is one of sensitivity for single cases and small outbreaks, not extreme timeliness. To detect a single case, a biosurveillance system must have extremely high case detection sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic precision (or the prior probability must be extremely high, e.g., owing to intelligence information). A biosurveillance system would have to rely either on case detection by the healthcare system or on computer-based case detection. Computer-based case detection would have to be capable of diagnostic precision at least at the level of finding individuals with Gram-positive rods in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid and pneumonia on chest radiograph (which would be highly suggestive of anthrax). Examples of potential computer-based components include clinical information systems with decision support at the point of care, systems to monitor laboratory reporting of microbiology cultures; and flee-text processing algorithms that scrutinize autopsy reports, newspaper stories, and obituaries for unusual deaths of animals or humans. If there are multiple cases, the demographics of the victims or the discovery of a geographic clustering of victims could help to identify a common cause with case detection at lower levels of diagnostic precision. In the absence of astute clinical diagnosis, it is likely that a single case of disease caused by a weaponized organism will progress to fatality. The requirements, therefore, include biosurveillance components (manual or automatic) that analyze unexplained deaths.",

It is simple if the organization planning a system requests that the designer automate the collection of data that the organization is already receiving. It may be quite challenging if the organization specifies an engineering goal of earlier detection and leaves it to the designer to select data. In part, the designer's difficulty stems from the current lack of full understanding of the value of many of these types of data. The designer must weigh whether data can meet functional requirements for timeliness and accuracy of detection, the availability of the data, and the cost and efforts to acquire the data. Cost and effort may be dominant factors for data that either require effort on the part of many individuals or organizations to obtain the data, or data that are distributed among many computer systems, especially if the biosurveillance system will monitor at the national or international level. The chapters in Parts II and IV of this book provide detail about data availability and the cost and effort to obtain different types of data.",

Designers of biosurveillance systems have an opportunity to adopt a more formal engineering approach that begins with specification of functional requirements. At this time, the understanding of such requirements for most diseases, however, is incomplete. There is a general recognition that systems should detect outbreaks \"as early as possible\"; however, this level of specification is less than ideal because designers must consider many tradeoffs between earliness and cost when designing systems. A designer may simplify the process of functional requirement specification by recognizing that a relatively small number of patterns can guide this process. The state of the art in functional requirement definition for biosurveillance is \"perhaps the end of the beginning,\" as Winston Churchill so aptly put it.",
