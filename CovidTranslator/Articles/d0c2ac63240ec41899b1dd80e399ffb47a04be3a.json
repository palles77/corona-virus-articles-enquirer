With swine, clinical signs can vary from inapparent infection to death, depending on the state of immunity, age of the animals and the strain of the virus. Clinical signs in young pigs are fever, inappetence and depression, followed by trembling, incoordination, convulsions, coma and death. Sows frequently exhibit increases in abortion, stillbirths and/or mummies. The course of this disease in all other species is short (<48 h) and begins with a brief excitement phase characterized by trembling, anxiety and aggressive behaviour.

This disease can be caused by a number of different agents but is usually associated with stress (such as occurs with shipping), a viral infection, followed by a bacterial infection. The bacteria most commonly associated with shipping fever is Mannheimia haemolytica (previously Pasteurella haemolytica). This disease causes great economic losses due to reduced rate of gain of body weight, inefficient feed conversion, cost of treatments, condemnation of carcasses and death of the animals.",

If this collision results in damage to the genetic material that cannot be repaired, the cell is inactivated. Indirect inactivation results when a photon or electron passes very near to the genetic material and ionizes a molecule of another substance (usually water). The free radical resulting from this ionization reacts with the genetic material of the cell and results in inactivation. Microorganisms vary in their sensitivity to the direct effects of ionizing radiation, with bacterial spores and viruses being most resistant.
