Most existing data come from single clinical sites seeing returning travelers, or relate to single events. Methods: Investigators evaluated ill travelers returning from a mass gathering, and presenting to a GeoSentinel site between August 2015 and April 2019, and collected data on the nature of the event and the relation between final diagnoses and the mass gathering. Results: Of 296 ill travelers, 51% were female and the median age was 54 years (range: 1-88). Over 82% returned from a religious mass gathering, most frequently Umrah or Hajj. Only 3% returned from the Olympics in Brazil or South Korea. Other mass gatherings included other sporting events, cultural or entertainment events, and conferences. Respiratory diseases accounted for almost 80% of all diagnoses, with vaccine preventable illnesses such as influenza and pneumonia accounting for 26% and 20% of all diagnoses respectively. This was followed by gastrointestinal illnesses, accounting for 4.5%. Sixty-three percent of travelers reported having a pre-travel encounter with a healthcare provider. Conclusions: Despite this surveillance being limited to patients presenting to GeoSentinel sites, our findings highlight the importance of respiratory diseases at mass gatherings, the need for pre-travel consultations before mass gatherings, and consideration of vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal disease.",

            "text": "Attendance at an international mass gathering (MG) may expose travelers to health risks related to crowded conditions, population movement, and inadequate sanitation [1, 2] . According to the World Health Organization, an event can be classified as a MG if the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state, or nation hosting the event [2] . However, much of the available literature describes mass gatherings as those exceeding 25,000 persons. We describe demographic characteristics and diagnoses among travelers who attended a MG and presented with a travel-associated illness to a GeoSentinel site. August 17, 2015 , and April 30, 2019, were collected by GeoSentinel, a global clinicianbased surveillance network that monitors travel-related illnesses among international travelers and migrants [3] . GeoSentinel was established in 1995 as a collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the International Society of Travel Medicine. It consists of 68 clinical sites in 28 countries. GeoSentinel records ill persons' visits to network sites; well travelers are not captured. Attendance at a MG is routinely recorded. During the study period, investigators were directed to enter supplemental details on the nature and location of the MG and to evaluate whether the diagnosis was likely associated with MG attendance. Records were excluded if the mass gathering was likely to have < 25,000 attendees or if data were missing regarding the type of MG. GeoSentinel's data collection protocol has been reviewed by a human subjects advisor at CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases and is classified as public health surveillance and not human subjects research. Additional ethics clearance was obtained by participating sites as required by their respective institutions or national regulations.",

These findings are consistent with previously published literature demonstrating that outbreaks are not frequently reported during or after MGs other than Umrah and Hajj pilgrimages, although they sometimes occur at Muslim, Christian, and Hindu religious events, sports events, and large-scale open-air festivals [9, 10] . Its size, international recognition, unique multinational component, and yearly recurrence, likely account for the preponderance of Umrah and Hajj among international MGs responsible for outbreaks. Our data are also consistent with previous reports regarding the older age of Umrah and Hajj travelers [11] , and the younger age of Scout Jamboree travelers. The finding that almost three-quarters of ill travelers who attended Umrah or Hajj were hospitalized is likely due to a recruitment bias, given that ill travelers seen at GeoSentinel sites may be sicker because of the specialized infectious disease or tertiary care nature of these sites; or to initial clinical suspicion for Middle East respiratory syndrome, resulting in hospitalization and isolation pending testing. The paucity of reported trauma is also likely a reflection of the infectious disease specialization of most GeoSentinel network sites, and of the fact that trauma usually requires immediate attention and is most likely to occur during travel [12] .",

Crowded conditions with close proximity of large numbers of attendees at Umrah and Hajj are a likely explanation for the frequency of respiratory infections among pilgrims, given the transmissibility of these infections. Our results confirm the importance of influenza vaccination for Umrah and Hajj travelers [15] . Although the availability of influenza vaccine may be limited depending on the time of year Hajj occurs [16] , immunization with expired influenza vaccine from the recently ended influenza season may have few associated adverse events [17] . By contrast, most illnesses among travelers attending the Olympics were linked to travel, but not to attending the Olympics, and these illnesses' were mild, which may be due to the physical separation of various sporting events at the Olympics, the propensity to hold the Olympics in high income countries, the relatively short travel duration of attendees and participants, and the relatively young age of participants. This is supported by the rarity of documented outbreaks during Olympic Games between 1984 and 2014 [9, 18] .",

Such data may have important consequences regarding vaccine recommendations before travel. In particular, it may be possible to validate that the influenza serotypes found are representative of strains circulating during the prior northern winter. These data also may provide justification for recommending pneumococcal vaccination for some high-risk travelers [19] [20] [21] . However, one-third of all travelers in this report did not attend a pre-travel consultation, and this will likely be a barrier to implementation of such recommendations. Many countries have a staging area where Umrah and Hajj attendees gather before departure, or have pre-Hajj classes at local mosques. Leaders there could raise awareness of recommended (but not required) vaccines and personal protective measures such as carrying and routinely using hand sanitizer may lead to higher level of protective behaviors of traveling pilgrims [22] . Also, primary care physicians should inquire about planned travel to mass gatherings and vaccinate travelers against meningococcus, influenza, and pneumococcus, as appropriate. Given its broad international catchment, GeoSentinel plays a role in identifying emerging infectious diseases with epidemic potential, thus contributing to efforts to create enhanced international multidisciplinary surveillance of MG-associated illnesses, as recently recommended by experts [23] . Since our surveillance was limited to patients presenting to GeoSentinel sites, to better understand travelassociated illnesses acquired at MGs improved global surveillance mechanisms are needed.",
