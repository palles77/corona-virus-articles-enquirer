The continuous detection and remote monitoring of infected patients are required in order to prevent the spread of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Healthcare services based on Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing technologies are emerging as a more effective and proactive solution which provides remote continuous monitoring of patients. A novel architecture based on Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID), wearable sensor technology, and cloud computing infrastructure is proposed for the detection and monitoring of Ebola infected patients. The aim of this work is to prevent the spreading of the infection at the early stage of the outbreak. The J48 decision tree is used to evaluate the level of infection in a user depending on his symptoms. RFID is used to automatically sense the close proximity interactions (CPIs) between users. Temporal Network Analysis (TNA) is applied to describe and monitor the current state of the outbreak using the CPI data. The performance and accuracy of our proposed model are evaluated on Amazon EC2 cloud using synthetic data of two million users. Our proposed model provided 94 % accuracy for the classification and 92 % of the resource utilization.",

            "text": "Ebola is one of the deadliest and infectious virus which spreads rapidly and affects a large volume of the population. The Ebola virus (EboV) spreads among people through contacts with an infected person and causes a severe viral hemorrhagic fever along with other symptoms such as nausea, anorexia, abdominal pain, headache, myalgia, and sore throat (Sureau 1989) . The incubation period of EVD varies from 2 to 21 days and in severe forms of the disease, death may occur within 5-10 days after onset of illness (Tseng and Chan 2015) . According to the World Health Organization (WHO 2016), a total of 28,601 Ebola cases has been detected in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone and out of them, 11,300 cases reported death by January 2016. Healthcare professionals who are engaged in the treatment of EVD patients unknowingly contracted the virus from such patients and then further facilitate infection transmission (William et al. 2014) . In a study conducted by Lehmann et al. (2016) observed that the healthcare professionals hesitate to associate with EVD patients due to high risk of infection. In 2014, EVD outbreaks in West Africa is the largest episodes having a fatality rate of 76.4 % (Fasina et al. 2015) . The EVD has the large epidemic potential of the outbreak, which results in the rise in the number of EVD cases and might be transmitted from one country to another. The EVD patients can be cured by proper educational campaigns and treatment as in the case of the French nurse cured from EboV (Rachah and Torres 2016) . The continuous monitoring of outbreak moves the attention from disease to prediction and prevention of the virus from spreading. Hence, there is a need of using both antiviral drugs or vaccines as well as IT-based strategies to reduce its harmful effects.",

The existing healthcare systems are unable to control and monitor such diseases efficiently accompanying with minimal cost. So, an intelligent and efficient system is required to provide ubiquitous healthcare support services in real time using IT infrastructure. A major challenge in any nationwide healthcare systems is the acquisition of health-related information from the patient in real time and requirement of huge storage capacity and high computational power to store and process the data respectively. Recent advances in sensing and distributed technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing makes it possible to design a smart healthcare system that enables remote continuous monitoring of patients in an unobtrusive and seamless manner. Using such technologies, it not only reduces consumed manpower of health workers but also reduce the cost of medical healthcare services. Cloud computing along with wireless body area network (WBAN) can be efficiently employed for the prevention and monitoring of the patient. WBAN consists of a group of small and lightweight body sensors attached to the patient's body to collect vital parameters of the body that can be used for long-term monitoring of chronic diseases efficiently (Sareen et al. 2016a, b; Andreu-Perez et al. 2015) . These sensors produce a vast amount of data that needs to be stored and processed in real time. Cloud computing can offer virtually unlimited resources for the remote storage and computation of such big data collecting from WBANs of the patients. Through the use the cloud computing, the physiological data generated by WBANs can be shared by doctors, healthcare agencies, and government agencies.",

The proposed system will keep track of the current status of the outbreak and identify the infected users responsible for the spread of the disease. To achieve these objectives, real time Ebola diagnosis and monitoring system is proposed based on IoT, RFID, mobile phone, and cloud computing infrastructure is proposed. Initially, each patient is registered through a mobile application by entering personal and contact information. The system automatically generates a unique identification number (UID) and is allocated to each registered patient. The UID is used for all the future communications between patients, doctors, and the hospitals. The data of EVD symptoms from body sensors in digital form is collected through patient's mobile phone using the Bluetooth technology. The stream data is continuously collected and stored in the cloud database for indepth analysis. Data is classified using J48 decision tree which categorizes the users into six categories based on their respective symptoms. Once the users are classified into different categories, they are monitored continuously using WBAN and RFID. RFID senses the close proximity interaction between infected and uninfected patients and an alert message is generated and sent to the uninfected patient to avoid such contacts with infected patients. Several outbreak metrics such as clustering coefficient, centrality, and temporal path length are computed using Temporal Network Analysis (TNA).",

Park et al. (2015) performed an evaluation of sequences from 232 EboV infected patients in Sierra Leona and analyzed viral evolution during prolonged transmission between users. Matua et al. (2015) performed in-depth analysis on strategies used to control the spread of the outbreak and proposed new techniques to improve the management and control of EboV during future outbreaks. Edelsburg and Shir-Raz (2015) examined the role of media in the spread of disease in such a crisis situation. Moghadam et al.

The category E of the infected patient shows mild fever along with a cough or a sore throat. During this phase, the level of infection in the body of the patient is low. However, if fever and sore throat are high along with secondary symptoms such as a headache, body ache, then the patient is infectious and the category of infection will be I. In this stage, the patient absorbs sufficiently large infection that can be transmitted to other susceptible individuals. In category H, the infected patients show severe symptoms along with symptoms of category I. Finally, once the patient's immune system has cleared the parasite or infection and the patient are no longer infectious and comes under the category recovered (R).

Droplets from an infected user are transmitted to an uninfected user when they come in contact with each other, making CPIs highly relevant for virus spread.

RFID exchange radio waves when they come in proximity to each other and is one of the most promising technologies in the area of automatic identification of an object (Read et al. 2012) . Recent advances in RFID devices such as small, lightweight and long battery life make it ideal for social network studies. RFID tags are attached to the chest of the users in a certain geographic area monitoring for EVD outbreak to detect the contacts only when persons approach each other (e.g., face-to-face interactions). A mobile phone with a RFID reader is used to sense the RFID tag carry by another user. Whenever an uninfected user carrying the mobile phone comes in contact with an infected user wearing the RFID tag, the mobile phone sense the tag and identify the presence of the infected user. The range of proximity should be within 1-2 m of one another. This threshold limit is used to sense only those CPIs during which EboV can be transmitted (Vanhems et al. 2013) . The contact details captured by the mobile phone is sent to the cloud via 3G/4G internet connection for storage, processing, and continuous monitoring. An alert message will be automatically generated by the system and is sent to the mobile phone of an uninfected user. The objective is to avoid contact with an infected patient so as to prevent the spreading of the epidemic. The proximity detection is performed periodically, and each RFID tag sends contact information to the mobile phone of another user every few seconds . The time duration of 20-s interval is set during which the proximity can be evaluated with a confidence level of 99 % (Cattuto et al. 2010) .

Algorithm 3 is designed to create such patient dataset. The data about proximity contact details generated by RFID is also required for the appropriate evaluation of the monitoring process. We have used a real dataset measured by the SocioPatterns infrastructure (SocioPatterns 2016) that contains the contact details of the students during five days in December 2013. The file contains 188,508 entries and each entry describes close proximity interaction (CPI) between different students during 20-s intervals. Each line contains information about source, target, start time, end time, where source and target are the IDs of the students that come in proximity of 1-2 m for the time interval between the start time and end time (Mastrandrea et al. 2015) . Algorithm 4 is designed for generating synthetic data of 2 million users by mapping the CPI data between students at different time intervals with generated 5000 Ebola cases. Such data will be used to create TNA graph. Once the 5000 cases of Ebola virus are generated from Algorithm 3, they are classified into different categories using J48 decision tree in Weka 3.6 (Hall et al. 2009 ). Decision tree created by Weka 3.6 is shown in Fig. 2 . A 10-fold cross validation is applied to evaluate the performance of the J48 decision tree. Data of 5000 categories are tested in Weka 3.6 and various statistical results are produced as shown in Tables 8, 9 and 10. Decision tree classifies the users with an accuracy of 94 %. Table 8 shows the detailed accuracy of each category which is classified by the J48 decision tree. True positives (TP) also known as sensitivity is the percentage of categories of Ebola cases correctly classified by the classifier. False positives (FP) also known specificity is the percentage of Ebola cases wrongly classified by the classifier. The J48 classification algorithm produces high TP rate of 0.941 and low FP rate of 0.054. The relevancy of the results is provided by the two parameters precision and recall. The proposed classification algorithm provides higher values of precision and recall which are 0.901 and 0.912 respectively. The other statistical parameters F-Measure and ROC area both represents classification accuracy. An algorithm with a higher value of F-Measure and ROC area are more accurate and our J48 decision tree provides F-Measure of 0.880 and ROC area of 0.874 respectively. Hence, the use of J48 decision tree in our proposed architecture is justified.",

Initially, the system was started with 10,000 requests,then after each 5-min request to the system was increased by 10,000 and system performance was studied for a total experiment time of 100 min. Figure 6a represents resource utilized by the proposed model that vary with the different number of users. The system achieves saturation very fast when numbers of users reach 25,000 because more resources will be consumed to process them. Similarly, the response time of the proposed model for a different number of users is also shown in Fig. 6b . The system takes low response time for a less number of users as there are fewer records available in the database to perform any operation. Figure 6c shows the latency time of the proposed model for a different number of users. The accurate categorization of users is a vital step in our proposed model. Different classification algorithms such as a random tree, Naive Bayes, and REPTree are also tested in Weka 3.6 to compare their performance with our proposed J48 decision tree. We have evaluated the performance of the classifiers on the Amazon EC2 cloud for a given synthetic dataset of 2 million users and compared their performances. Table 11 shows the comparative classification performance in different classification model tested in Weka 3.6. J48 decision tree provides higher accuracy than other classifiers. Figure 7 illustrates the comparison of the accuracy of the different classification algorithms.",
