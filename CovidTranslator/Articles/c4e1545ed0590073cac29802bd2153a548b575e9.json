The stability of small-world spreading model with predictive controller is investigated. The sufficient and necessary stability condition is given, which is closely related to the controller parameters and small-world rewiring probability p. Our simulations discover a phenomenon that, with the fixed predictive controller parameters, the spreading dynamics become more and more stable when p decreases from a larger value to a smaller one, and the suitable controller parameters can effectively suppress the spreading behaviors even when p varies within the whole spectrum, and the unsuitable controller parameters can lead to oscillation when p lies within a certain range.",

The current outbreak of H1N1 flu was first detected in Mexico City on March 18, 2009 . The World Health Organization (WHO) declared an H1N1 pandemic on June 11, 2009 , moving the alert level to phase 6, marking the first global pandemic since the 1968 Hong Kong flu. Up till now, the virus has already propagated in all regions of the world. In 2003, the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) leads to 8096 known infected cases and 774 deaths worldwide, declared by the WHO in the concluding report. The spread of computer viruses and worms on the Internet is another urgent problem.",

Moukarzel proposed a novel linear model of disease spreading in d-dimensional small-world lattices, which produces an exponential growth of infection to the limit of network scale [14] . The investigations on the outbreak of SARS in 2003 have shown that the high clustering of small-world human social network is one of the keys to transmit SARS [15] [16] [17] . In fact, when the epidemic diseases propagate among humans or the computer viruses spread through the Internet, the administrative authorities usually take some counter measures to control the unfavorable prevalence. Prof. Li et al. have carried out some pioneering researches on the stability of the spreading dynamics in smallworld network when control strategies are applied, and made great achievements. It was recently reported that there exist oscillating infective behaviors with some unsuitable recovery rates in the epidemiology [18] , indicating the possible oscillations resulted from control strategies applied by the administrative authorities. However, Prof. Li inherent after studying the stability of spreading models with linear and nonlinear feedback controllers [8] . Prof. Li et al. further investigated three linear delayed SIR models for different cases of recovery response, and found that the unsuitable recovery strength may lead to oscillations [6] .",

When r = 10, q H p = 1 and p = 0.2, two poles of the closed-loop system are outside of the unit circle as shown in Table 1 . From the theorem, we can judge that the spreading behavior is unstable, and the decision is also proved by the result of simulation, depicted in Fig. 2(a) . We can see that, the predictive controlled small-world spreading model oscillates, and furthermore it is discovered from the simulations that the spreading behavior even diverges if the output constraint is not considered. When r = 10, q H p = 1 and p = 0.1, three roots of polynomial T (z) = 0 are all inside the unit circle, so the closed-loop system is stable as shown in Fig. 2(c) . Further decreasing the rewiring probability p to 0.05 results in a more stable spreading dynamics, which can be found by comparing Fig. 2(c) with Fig. 2(e) .

Decreasing r, increasing q H p , and decreasing p are valid for stabilizing the oscillations of the infected individuals V (k) to the set value. We have discovered that, the epidemic oscillations in predictive-controlled small-world spreading model are avoidable even when p varies within the whole spectrum if the suitable control parameters are applied; and on the contrary, the unsuitable control parameters can lead to spreading oscillations when p lies within a certain range.",
