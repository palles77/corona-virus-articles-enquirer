            "text": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether acute pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis associated with nonbacterial infections are clinically distinguishable from other exacerbations. Eighty exacerbations in 54 patients were studied. Exacerbations associated with influenza (n = 8) were compared with those associated with other nonbacterial infections (n = 15) and those in which no nonbacterial infection was detected (n = 57). Patients with influenza had lower 5hwachman scores and were more likely to be seropositive for C-reactive protein than patients in the other two groups. Patients with influenza had a mean decrease in forced expiratory volume per second of 26%, compared with test results obtained before the exacerbation. In contrast, the mean decrease in forced expiratory volume per second was 6% for other nonbacterial infections and 12% for the group without nonbacterial infection (p <0.05 for both comparisons). The forced expiratory flow in first 25% of vital capacity decreased 44% in the influenza group compared with 13% and 17% in the other two groups, respectively (p <0.01 for both comparisons). The influenza group also had a higher proportion of patients with at least a 20% decrease in forced expiratory volume per second and forced expiratory flow in first 25% of vital capacity than the other two groups had (p <0.05 for all comparisons). These data suggest that influenza is associated with severe exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis and support recommendations for efforts to prevent influenza in this population. 1990;117:200-4) Studies of patients with cystic fibrosis suggest that approximately one third of acute pulmonary exacerbations are associated with nonbacterial infections. 1-4 Although the incidence of viral respiratory infection in patients with CF is comparable to that in unaffected children, 5' 6 frequent infections in these patients may be associated with an increased rate of pulmonary deterioration. 5 ",

All patients who were seen at the CF clinic at the University of Utah Medical Center between September 1986 and April 1987 with an acute pulmonary exacerbation of CF were eligible for admission to the study. Pulmonary exacerbations were defined as an acute change in health associated with fever or hemoptysis or with an increase in dyspnea, cough, or sputum production. At the time of enrollment, each patient's history was obtained, and physical examination and an evaluation of severity of the underlying CF by Shwachman score were also done. Each patient also had specimens collected for viral and bacterial culture, viral serologic studies, complete blood cell count and differential cell count, and determination of serum C-reactive protein. Patients old enough to cooperate were asked to participate in pulmonary function studies. All exacerbations for which either a viral culture or both acute and convalescent serum specimens were collected were included in the data analysis. Of 84 exacerbations, four (5%) were excluded from the data analysis because these specimens were not available.",
