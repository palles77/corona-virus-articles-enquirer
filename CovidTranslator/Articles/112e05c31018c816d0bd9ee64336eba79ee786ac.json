The short transmission cycle (serial interval) of COVID-19 and results from viral shedding studies suggested the possibility of transmission near or even before symptom onset, while prolonged viral shedding raised concerns about prolonged infectiousness and the need for extended hospital stay. [4] [5] [6] A few preliminary contact-tracing studies showed that the highrisk exposure setting of COVID-19 transmission was in the household. [7] [8] [9] Nevertheless, these fragmented knowledges were still inadequate to answer some practical questions like, when and how long we should isolate a COVID-19 patient or quarantine close contacts. To connect these insights and reveal the full picture of COVID-19 transmission, evidence from the field is urgently needed to provide information about the transmission risk at different time points after symptom onset and at different exposure settings.",

For household contacts who lived with the index case, the day of first contact was set to be the day of symptom onset of the index case. Secondary clinical attack rate was calculated by dividing the number of symptom confirmed cases by the number of close contacts. We analyzed the dynamic change of secondary clinical attack rate after symptom onset in several ways. First, we categorized contacts based on the time of the initial exposure to the index case after index case's symptom onset (days 0-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, or >9).

            "text": "By February 26, there were 32 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, including five household/family clusters and four asymptomatic patients. Sixteen (50%) patients were imported, and the remaining 16 cases were locally acquired. Of the 16 locally-acquired cases, three patients without any travel history were detected because of pneumonia of unknown etiology. The remaining 13 cases were secondary cases found through contact tracing. One of the 13 cases was excluded from subsequent transmission pair analysis because the documented day of exposure occurred after symptom onset of the secondary case. The median delay from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis was 5 days (range 0-12) among imported cases and 18.5 days (range 2-28) among locally-acquired cases ( Figure 1A ). All secondary cases had their first day of exposure within five days of the index case's symptom onset ( Figure 1B ). The presumed transmission trees were depicted in Figure 1C . We estimated that the mean incubation period was 4.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.7-8.4), and the mean serial interval was 7.0 days (95% CrI 3.7-13.2).",

Another virological study in COVID-19 patients also found no viable isolates of the virus after the first week of symptoms. Our data agreed with the virological data on high transmissibility in the first week and much decreased risk afterwards. 16 To summarize the evidence, the decreasing risk for secondary infection over time in our study, the observed short serial interval, and the trend of decreasing viral shedding and viability after symptom onset strongly suggested high transmissibility of the disease near or even before the day of symptom onset.

In this case, hospitalization would not be helpful for isolation and reducing transmission, and should be spared for severe patients. When the number of confirmed cases increases rapidly, home care for patients with mild illness should be considered. 20 In Taiwan, the most prolonged duration of hospital isolation for the 32 confirmed cases was more than one month. If every patient with mild illness is to be isolated in the hospital or other isolation institutes for such a prolonged period, the healthcare system will soon be overwhelmed during a large epidemic. In this case, an unusually high case fatality rate such as that observed in Wuhan may occur. 21, 22 Similarly, better understanding of the potential duration of transmission could help direct containment strategies. For example, the efforts of contacting tracing could focus on the contacts near or even before symptom onset of the index cases when the number of index cases or contacts is too large to afford. To fight a potential pandemic like COVID-19, improved efficiency for resource allocation will be critical since a massive outbreak will rapidly consume public health and medical resources.",

Our analysis revealed the early transmission dynamics with relatively short infectious period of COVID-19: a higher transmission risk around the time of symptom onset of the index case, followed by a lower transmission risk at the later stage of disease. The observed decreasing transmission risk over time for COVID-19 was in striking contrast to the transmission pattern of SARS, in which the transmission risk remained low until after day 5 of symptom onset in the index cases.15 Our finding might explain the substantially shorter transmission cycle (serial interval) of COVID-19 than that of SARS. Following Nishiura et al,4 we updated the information on transmission pairs from published reports and included 48 pairs. The updated serial interval had a mean of 5.4 days (95% CrI 4.1-7.2 days) (Supplementary Appendix). In contrast, the mean serial interval of SARS was estimated to be 8.4 days in Singapore.15",

In a modeling study, Hellewell et al. found that the possibility of controlling COVID-19 through isolation and contact tracing decreased with increasing proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset. 19 This simulation combined with our findings might explain the difficult situation in Wuhan, South Korea, Iran, and Italy. Aggressive social distancing and proactive contact tracing might be necessary to block the transmission chain of COVID-19 and to keep presumptive patients away from susceptible populations with a high risk for severe disease. The observed short duration of infectiousness with lower risk of transmission one week after symptom onset had critical implications on redirecting the control efforts of COVID-19.

Second, we could not completely separate out the effect of close household contact and early contact given the strong correlation of the two. The increased transmissibility in the early stage of COVID-19 may be partially attributed to the effect of household and non-household family contacts rather than increased infectiousness at the early stage. But the pattern of early transmission remained when we stratified by type of exposure. In summary, our analysis suggested that the majority of transmission of COVID-19 occurred at the very early stage of the disease, and the secondary clinical attack rate among contacts decreased over the time line of symptom development. The pattern of high transmissibility near symptom onset and possible short infectious period may drastically change the thinking of control strategies for COVID-19.
