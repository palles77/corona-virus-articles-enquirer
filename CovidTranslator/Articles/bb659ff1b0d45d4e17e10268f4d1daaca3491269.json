            "text": "Magazines and information brochures have been removed from waiting rooms to reduce possible sources of contact contagion.The standard hygiene procedures in treatment rooms, CT-simulation and consultation rooms have been stressed and respected by all the personnel: the surfaces have been disinfected by alcoholic solutions after every procedure and disposable sheets, as usual, have been used.Patient supportOncological patients are quite fragile from both physical and psychological points of view.Moreover, many of them are in the elderly age and somehow more susceptible to aggressive coronavirus infection. Nurses, technologists and physicians had to spend quite a lot of time giving information, explaining prevention measures and reassuring patients.Thus far, nobody has cancelled any appointment, but some of them asked to postpone the first consultation or the simulation procedure. Very few patients under treatment interrupted the course, and some of them needed help to access the service because of lack of volunteer transportation.Counseling for psychological support is offered to both patients and professionals.Re-organization of the activities Since March 8 th , all the scheduled visits have been critically evaluated by the clinicians. We are postponing the follow-up visits; nurses contact the patients by phone asking for the results of the last tests performed and proposing a new appointment at the end of the emergency if negative. If there is a suspicion of relapse, a radiation oncologist evaluates the need for further investigation or an appointment. We did not postpone the first consultations of the patients who need treatments for malignant tumors. We considered the postponement of some treatments such as those for prostate cancer under hormone therapy and those for adjuvant purposes, especially in elderly patients, but always keeping the timing indicated by the international guidelines. The appointment time for visits and CT-simulation were scattered across the day to minimize the number of people in the waiting rooms. Our daily staff meeting has not been suspended, but only the clinicians directly involved in the management of the clinical cases of the day can participate, to reduce the number of people in the meeting room and maintaining the 1-m distance. Multidisciplinary meetings are not postponed but it was decided to reduce the number of clinicians and/or discuss the clinical cases by videoconference or just phone whenever possible. Of note, we decided to postpone a not-urgent brachytherapy treatment because the dedicated room was used for isolating a patient with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Staff Professionals All the staff members are wearing a surgical mask and gloves when visiting patients. Triage nurses wear surgical masks, gloves and disposable surgical coats. The use of FFP2 or FFP3 masks is reserved for hospital staff who assist patients with respiratory infections (flu, tuberculosis)/COVID positive. Staff members are invited to measure body temperature daily and asked not to go to work if it is above 37.5\u00b0 and/or have respiratory symptoms. All permissions for personal absences of the medical, technical, nursing and administrative staff were suspended. Medical Physics The service of Medical Physics in the Hospital is working by prioritizing essential and urgent tasks and postpone those tasks which can tolerate delays, i.e. those scheduled annually. Special attention is paid to risk assessment for the use of mobile radiography or CT-scanning in new locations of the Hospital and for testing and commissioning of additional portable equipment and scanners. Moreover, physicists may be involved in biomedical engineering departments providing assistance with patient monitoring and organ support equipment, e.g. ventilators or assessing the safety of face masks in MRI scanner. Quality controls in radiotherapy are mainly focused on equipment and dosimetry checks connected with advanced radiotherapy treatments (VMAT, SBRT, SRS, IGRT) and dosimetry assessment associated with radiotherapy treatment planning. To prevent the spread of the virus, they tend to work from home whenever possible, entering clinical locations if necessary but ensuring that staff resources are available for service demands. Academic teaching activity Universities, including Medical Schools, stopped their regular teaching activity in the whole country based on Ministry directive. However, teaching at the distance are performed using online platforms and live-streaming lessons. Some other educational and training activities are still going on in collaboration with the National Health System: medical students can be admitted to the departments on a voluntary basis but only at the last year of internship and for preparation of the thesis; and residents are continuing their educational program regularly and are encouraged to participate also to the management of SARS-CoV-2 related activities. Several senior residents in Emergency Medicine, Internal Medicine, Anesthesiology, Pneumology and Geriatrics have been recruited by the Hospitals in the Piedmont Region to assist patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, following the Ministry directive in agreement with Academic Institutions.",
