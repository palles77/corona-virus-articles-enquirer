            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. 1 The coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) is probably the most studied human coronavirus (HCoV) and produces a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections and can also cause gastroenteritis. 2 Although containment of the first SARS epidemic in 2003 succeeded through epidemiological and quarantine measures, there is still no definitive therapy for SARS or other coronaviral infections. Shortly after the SARS outbreak, in 2003, researchers also identified HCoV-NL63 2,3 as another HCoV that causes respiratory infections and pneumonia. The virus is found worldwide and infects mainly young children, elderly, and immunodeficient patients. Both SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as the cellular receptor to infect host cells. 4, 5 Coronaviral genomic RNA is released in the cell cytoplasm after infection, which then translates into two long polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. 6 The replicase gene of coronaviruses often encodes two cysteine papain-like proteases, PLP1 and PLP2, and a cysteine chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro). SARS-CoV, avian infectious bronchitis virus, and some of the bat coronaviruses (BtCoVs) are distinct in that they encode only one papain-like protease domain. [7] [8] [9] In the case of SARS-CoV, autocatalytic processing of the polyproteins by PLpro and 3CLpro generates up to 16 non-structural proteins (nsps). 3CLpro is the main protease that processes multiples sites in the replicase polyprotein and has been targeted for therapeutic development. 10, 11 PLpro cleaves pp1a at three sites 12 and has been shown to be essential for viral replication. [13] [14] [15] The resulting nsps coalesce with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to form the multifunctional replicase complex. This complex is instrumental in sub-genomic RNA synthesis and, thus, proliferation of infection. 16, 17 In recent work, we introduced two classes of SARS-CoV PLpro-specific non-covalent inhibitors that exhibit significant SARS antiviral efficacy. [13] [14] [15] The crystal structure of inhibitor GRL0617 bound to the protein superimposed on the apo (open) X-ray structure (Fig. 1a) indicates that group I inhibitors (a) The purple ribbon diagram represents the 15g (shown in yellow stick figure)-bound crystal structure (PDB ID: 3mj5) conformation of SARS-CoV PLpro superimposed on the GRL0617S inhibitor (cyan stick figure) complex protein conformation (PDB ID: 3e9s) shown as gray ribbon. It also highlights the side-chain changes in some of the binding site residues and loop conformation differences between the two ligand-bound protein conformations.

The BL2 loop assumes a closed-inverted conformation compared to the open unbound X-ray structure. These compounds do not show any potency against either NL63-PLP2 or other human deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes. 15 Group II PLpro inhibitors, however, do not induce the peptide bond inversion of the loop residues upon binding. 14 The BL2 loop still locks down over inhibitor 15g, which wraps around the loop similar to inhibitor GRL0617. Figure 1b and c shows the two distinct inhibitor-bound conformations of the protein backbone, with group I inhibitors inducing a peptide bond inversion in the loop, while group II inhibitors do not. [13] [14] [15] To establish a foundation for docking and other in silico screening approaches, we have used conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) followed by accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] to reproduce the observed binding site conformational flexibility. We also examined the correlation between the movement in the inter-sheet loops of the finger domain and the motion of the BL2 loop. We find that peptide bond inversion between the open and closed states of the binding loop is not observed in the picosecond-nanosecond timescale using cMD. However, aMD allows the trajectory to find an appropriate way out of each state at an enhanced rate. This acceleration stems from the addition of a non-negative boost potential that raises the energy within the potential energy basins. This approach increases conformational sampling through modification of the energy landscape of the model system by lowering energy barriers through the application of a boost potential, \u0394V(r), to the true potential surface, V(r). Hence, a trajectory propagated on this modified surface makes transitions from state to state with an accelerated rate. 19 Starting from the GRL0617-bound BL2 loop conformation, we observe inversion of the peptide bond between residues Tyr269 and Gln270 to a conformation similar to that in the apo BL2 loop conformation in the last 5 ns of the aMD simulation, with the conformational transition propagating in this simulation from Gly267 at the beginning of the loop through the central Tyr269-Gln270 peptide bond to Gly272 at the end of the loop. The resulting detailed description of loop conformational flexibility will ",

As noted above, the group I PLpro inhibitors show no activity against the very similar NL63-CoV PLP2 enzyme. 15 To better understand molecular recognition in these viral papain-like proteases, and to provide guidance for development of broaderspectrum inhibitors, we have developed a homology model for the NL63-CoV PLP2 active-site structure using SARS-CoV PLpro structure as a template. Except for the anchoring glycines, the BL2 loop of NL63-PLP2 is composed of a completely different set of amino acids (G253-SFDN-G258) from that in SARS-CoV PLpro (G267-NYQC-G272). SARS-CoV PLpro recognizes the consensus sequence -LXGG-, which is similar to the sequence at the C-terminal tail of ubiquitin, thereby rendering it a viral DUB enzyme. 12, 24 HCoV-NL63-PLP2 has also recently been identified as a DUB enzyme. 25 However, in SARS-CoV, the cleavage of pp1a by PLpro occurs at three sites after Gly-Gly sequences, to release nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3. 3 NL63-PLP2 recognizes similar substrate sequences, but the cleavage sites differ, with cleavage occurring between a Gly-Gly and Ala-Gly sequence instead of after Gly-Gly as in SARS-CoV PLpro. 25 Following the approach of Sulea et al., 26 we constructed our own multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for 20 coronaviral PLP domains from both R and O groups of 13 coronaviruses including HCoV-SARS using a profile alignment strategy. The ubiquitin aldehyde-bound protein model proposed by Ratia et al. that proposed interactions between the substrate RLRGG in the active site of SARS-CoV PLpro provided information on the probable substrate binding pockets. 12 We focused on 12 binding site and the two BL2 loop residues (Tyr269 and Gln270) that are instrumental in ligand binding from the SARS-CoV PLpro apo and two inhibitor-bound X-ray structures 12, 14, 15 to identify the corresponding residues in the PLP domain of other organisms (Table 1 ). Based on the MSA, we built homology models for NL63-PLP1 and NL63-PLP2 using the experimental three-dimensional (3D) apo structure of SARS-CoV PLpro 12 as a template. NL63-PLP1 was predicted to belong to the O group and lacks DUB activity and is hence less interesting for our comparative study here. 26 In this study, we focus on the 3D structural superimposition of the model on the apo crystal structure to identify substrate cleavage site specificity determining residues between the binding pockets of SARS-CoV PLpro and NL63-PLP2 only. The electrostatic and topological differences between the binding sites of the two proteases defined by these residues, along with docking studies of our PLpro inhibitors, suggest mechanisms of inhibitor selectivity.",

Thus, the equilibrated system after 12 ns of cMD was subjected to 5 ns of whole-protein aMD, followed by 5 ns of aMD with a single boost to the potential on the 10 critical loop residues (Tyr265-Tyr274). After 19.5 ns of total simulation time, during the last 2.5 ns of aMD, we observed the peptide bond between Tyr269-Gln270 (the \u03c8 of Tyr269 and \u03d5 of Gln270) invert from the GRL0617-bound protein conformation (X-ray dihedral angles of 124. Some of the neighboring loop residues were studied to determine the order of torsion changes required to enable this peptide bond inversion. It is interesting to note that the BL2 loop is flanked by two Gly residues on each end that allow for considerable translational and rotational degrees of freedom for the loop by acting as hinges for the extensive loop motion. The \u03c8 of Asn268 partially rotates first and stabilizes during 10-17 ns, then after 17 ns, it goes back to its original bound conformational torsion. The \u03d5-\u03c8 dihedral plots of Gly267 and Gly272 and Asn268 in Fig. 4c and d show that the \u03c8 angles of both Gly267 and Gly272 start increasing and eventually do a complete 180\u00b0inversion after 17 ns. This inversion of the Gly residues is probably correlated with the Gln270 \u03d5 inversion to its apo conformation at nearly the same time. These inverted dihedrals remain stable for another 2 ns, after which the \u03c8 of Tyr269 also rotates by 180\u00b0a round 19.5 ns. At this point, both the Gln270 \u03d5 and the Tyr269 \u03c8 sample the apoprotein dihedrals for the next 2 ns and the BL2 loop assumes the open state. In the last 2 ns of the simulation, the Gly267 \u03c8 fluctuates; however, the Gly272 \u03c8 stabilizes in the inverted state. This transition is summarized in more detail in Fig. 5 , where it can be seen that the conformational transition starts on the Gly267 side of the loop, moves across, and ends on the Gly272 side. The apo crystal structure demonstrates that the Gly272 \u03c8 indeed inverts from \u2212 144.8 in the GRL0617-bound form to + 134 (average of three chains 135, 154, and 113), whereas the \u03d5 remains unchanged. Similarly, the \u03d5-\u03c8 of Gly267, which can readily invert back to its starting dihedral torsions after the peptide bond flip, agrees well with the Gly267 \u03d5-\u03c8 dihedral values from the apo X-ray structure. Hence, we can conclude that the inversion of at least the \u03c8 angle of one Gly residue is required for the peptide bond inversion between Tyr269 and Gln270. However, it should be noted that this transitional order is observed from a single simulation and that more extensive averaging over trajectories would be required to confirm the preferred inter-conversion pathway. Overall electrostatic potential maps for SARS-CoV PLpro, NL63-PLP2, and NL63-PLP1 active sites Figure 6b depicts the solvent-exposed electrostatic contour map of the active site of the HCoV-NL63-PLP2 model, which is compared to that of the Xray structure of SARS-CoV PLpro in Fig. 6a . The active site in SARS-CoV PLpro is broadly electronegative, the P1 and P2 sites are mainly neutral if not slightly electropositive, the P3 pocket is fairly electronegative, while the P4 and P5 pockets are quite basic.",

From a structural perspective, this appears important in determining DUB activity for the enzymes, since a change in surface electrostatic potential around the mouth of the active site would likely disrupt the binding of the substrate (C-terminal tail of ubiquitin, RLRGG) for cleavage and therefore produce loss of the enzyme's DUB functionality. Consequently, we predict that mutating residue Glu156 to Lys in NL63-PLP2 should lead to loss of DUB activity. The electrostatic characteristics of the binding site do not appear to be significantly influenced by dynamics.

Similarly, the hydrophobic interactions were qualitatively measured as the distance between the centroid of interacting aromatic pairs (and the fivemembered rings of proline, in the case of hydrophobic interactions other than \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking).

Clearly, the presence of a cationic residue (Lys or Arg) at the substrate S3 position will not be accommodated well by the Lys (K152) in the active site of NL63-PLP2, which partly determines the P3 pocket specificity. Instead, the substrate Lys is more likely accommodated in the P4 pocket of NL63-PLP2, which is broadly electronegative.

Structural superimposition of the two proteases suggested residues that may influence molecular recognition and differentiate one protease from another. We showed that electrostatic forces within the substrate binding pockets play an important role in differentiating the substrate specificities of SARS-CoV PLpro from those of NL3-PLP2. Single-residue substitutions in the active sites among the coronaviral proteases can be readily identified from Table 1 . However, the impact of these substitutions is not clear from the 2D sequence alignment alone. Structural models provide additional insights into the stereochemical characteristics and topology of the active site that help determine specific substrate-protein interactions as seen through Fig. 6a -c.",

Clearly, the presence of a cationic residue (Lys or Arg) at the substrate S3 position will not be accommodated well in the P3 pocket of NL63-PLP2 but will be better accommodated in the broadly electronegative P4 pocket. This results in a oneresidue shift in the alignment of the substrate in the active site of NL63-PLP2, as shown in Fig. 7 . Thus, NL63-PLP2 cleavage occurs between the Gly-Gly sequences in LXGG instead of after the Gly-Gly sequence, as in SARS-CoV PLpro.",

Identification of residues that cause the distinction will aid in future drug development efforts. Our current SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors do not inhibit NL63-PLP2, and it appears likely that development of broad-spectrum papain-like protease inhibitors will require structural changes to accommodate the differing topologies and binding site residues highlighted in the binding site of HCoV-NL63-PLP2.",

SHAKE constraints were applied so that bonds involving hydrogen were constrained. 30, 31 During constant energy simulation, the pressure relaxation time was 2.0 ps and the temperature coupling parameter was 5.0. Throughout all simulations, the time step was set to 2 fs, and the particle mesh Ewald method was employed 32-35 accordingly with a direct sum tolerance of 0.000001. For minimization, the solvent was first minimized with the solute fixed with a 10-kcal/ mol\u00b7\u00c5 constraint, where 1010 steps of steepest descent minimization were performed followed by at most 50,000 steps of conjugate gradient or until the RMS gradient was less than 10 \u2212 4 kcal/mol\u00b7\u00c5. Then, the constraints on the solute were released, and 100 steps of steepest descent minimization were performed followed by at most 50,000 steps of conjugate gradient or until the RMS gradient was less than 10 \u2212 4 kcal/mol\u00b7\u00c5. Two model systems were studied, the first of which was directly adapted from the apo (open) crystal structure [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 2fe8], 12 with the second system extracted from the closed complex structure of GRL0617 bound to PLPro (PDB ID: 3e9s) 15 with the GRL0617 inhibitor removed. These structures show that the thumb, finger, and palm sub-domains of PLpro are in close contact with each other. In contrast, the ubiquitin-like domain is loosely connected to the rest of the catalytic domain and is separated from the active site by 30-50 \u00c5. Hence, we considered the ubiquitin-like domain to be less relevant to the BL2 (Gly267-Gly272) loop movement and excluded it from our study. These modified structures, with open and closed BL2 loops, were used as starting points of our MD simulations. Each of the model systems was solvated in a 10-\u00c5 octahedral waterbox of TIP3P waters 36 (total, 43,410 atoms). Adding one sodium counterion neutralized the systems. Minimization was carried out in two steps, with water molecules further than 10 \u00c5 from the protein minimized first for 50,000 steps followed by minimization of the entire system for another 5000 steps. Periodic boundary conditions were applied with a 10-\u00c5 non-bonded cutoff.",

The aMD method has been previously described. 18, [20] [21] [22] [23] [37] [38] [39] This method promotes sampling of infrequent events without prior knowledge of the locations of wells and barriers on the potential energy surface. Our implementation used the aMD version developed by Hamelberg and McCammon. 38 In this implementation, when the true potential V(r) of the model system falls below a chosen threshold boost energy E, the simulation is performed on the modified potential V * (r) = V(r) + \u0394V(r), where \u0394V(r) is a non-negative boost potential function and is given by \u0394V(r) = (E \u2212 V(r)) 2 /(\u03b1 + (E \u2212 V(r)). This leads to an enhanced escape rate for V * (r). Since the barriers in the dihedral potential energy term predominantly govern the sampling of torsional or rotameric states in proteins, the boost potential was applied only to the total dihedral energy term of the potential energy function. After 12 ns of conventional NVE production run, we performed 10 ns of aMD in two steps. The MD runs were performed in series. When no notable structural loop reorganizations were noted from the cMD run of 12 ns, we applied aMD in progressive phases. The 10 ns of aMD was split into two halves, with each 5-ns simulation run using a slightly different procedure. The experimental nature of this simulation exercise resulted in the aMD run being only 2 ns less than the cMD, which we recognize is somewhat unconventional. During each of the 5-ns aMD runs, only a single boost was used, with the difference being in the protein target area.",

The average dihedral energy V(r) of the open and closed systems after 12 ns of NVE was 2240 kcal/mol and 2268 kcal/mol, respectively. For the apo simulation, the threshold E apo value was set to 2300 [60 kcal/mol above V(r) apo ], and the bound simulation E bound value was set to 2400 [132 kcal/ mol above V(r) bound ], with the \u03b1 for both simulations set to 20% of their respective E values. After 5 ns of simulation, the average dihedral energy of the apo and bound proteins were 2285 and 2357 kcal/mol, respectively, but no \u03d5-\u03c8 dihedral inversion was observed. It should be noted that the inversion of the peptide bond in the loop from the bound form to the apo form would be expected to be much easier to capture than vice versa in the absence of a ligand that actually induces the peptide bond inversion. Hence, we continued the next 5 ns of aMD on a subset of loop residues for only the bound structure of the protein with ligand removed. aMD was employed on the 10 loop residues (Tyr265 to Tyr274, 165 atoms) with an \u03b1 of 50% of E bound-post-5 ns applied to the average dihedral energy of these amino acids.",

The protease activity is mediated by the catalytic triad of Cys112-His273-Asp287, 12, 54, 55 assisted by the indole ring or amino group of usually a few consistent amino acids, W107 in SARS-CoV PLpro (Gln or Asn among the other PLP2s), to support the oxyanion hole. 12 Coronavirus PLpro domains also have a signature substrate binding site that supports DUB activity. 12, 24, 26, 54, 55 The residues instrumental in maintaining the structural signature for the strict specificity of the substrate -LXGGin SARS-CoV PLpro include Tyr113, Tyr274, Asn110, Leu163, Gly164, Asp165, Glu168, Tyr265, and the blocking loop residues at the mouth of the active site beginning at Gly267 through Gly272 with Tyr269 and Gln270 being instrumental in ligand binding. 12, 15, 26 Details of the roles of these 14 residues were previously described. 12, 15 Table 1 highlights these key residues aligned with the corresponding binding site amino acids of 19 other coronaviral papain-like protease domains.",

The PyMOL program (DeLano Scientific) 58 was used for structural superposition. All hydrogens were added to the PLP2 model using Sybyl 8.1 (Tripos, Inc.) . The model thus generated was analyzed to characterize the physicochemical properties (hydrophobic and electrostatic patterns) of the substrate binding site using the Chimera software. 59 The electrostatic surface potential was calculated using Coulomb's law as implemented in Chimera. The surface maps were generated using the default color scale ranging from red (\u2212 10 kcal/ mol * e) to white (0) to blue (+ 10 kcal/mol * e) at a temperature of 298 K. Tripos 3D Benchware 60 was used to view hydrogen donors and acceptors in the active site of SARS-CoV PLpro and the PLP2 model. The donor and acceptor atoms for each pocket in each structure were counted by visual inspection.",

It is particularly interesting to note from Fig. 4a that starting from the closed form of the BL2 loop, although it translationally samples the open conformation around 5 ns, and again from \u223c 10 to 13 ns, it does not sample the dihedral rotation of the peptide bond during the same timescale without the additional boost applied through aMD just to the loop residues. In Fig. 4b, we show that not only does the BL2 loop sample both the open and the closed conformations, but the \u03c8-\u03d5 dihedral of the Tyr-Gln peptide bond also inverts from the starting closed state to the open form after 19.5 ns of total simulation time (12 ns cMD plus 7.5 ns aMD). During the last 2.5 ns, the closed BL2 loop continues to assume the open protein loop conformation (both translational and rotational) until the end of the simulation.",
