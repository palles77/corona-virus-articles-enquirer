The comparison of NBCZones among 169 eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and viral (chymo)trypsin-like proteases suggested the existence of 15 distinct groups determined by the combination of amino acids located at two \"key\" structure-functional positions 54 T and 55 T near the catalytic base His57 T .",

In contrast, viral proteases were distributed among seven groups, and lack this disulfide bond. Furthermore, only the [ST]A group of eukaryotic proteases contains glycine at position 43 T , which is instrumental for activation of these enzymes. In contrast, due to the side chains of residues at position 43 T prokaryotic and viral proteases do not have the ability to carry out the structural transition of the eukaryotic zymogen-zyme type.

In both families, the oxyanion hole is situated adjacent to the nucleophile and is mainly shaped by the main-chain nitrogen atoms of two residues, but again the sequential order is different. Knowing the importance of the existence of a catalytic acid, nucleophile, and oxyanion zones for the function of the \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolases fold enzymes and with the possible presence of similar structural formations in other types of hydrolases, we carried out a detailed analysis of the spatial structures of (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases near the catalytic triad residues.

Fig. 1 shows the catalytic triad that includes residues His57, Asp102 and Ser195. In addition to the base His57 and the nucleophile Ser195, the localization of Ser54, Ala55, and Cys58 of the PROSITE TRYPSIN_HIS pattern is shown, as well as amino acids of the PROSITE TRYPSIN_SER pattern: Gly193-Asp194-Ser195-Gly196-Gly197 and two main-chain nitrogens: N/Gly193 and N/Ser195, which are the canonical oxyanions OxyI and OxyII [11]. In trypsin, there are two amino acids that interact with both the PROSITE TRYPSIN_HIS pattern and the PROSITE TRYPSIN_SER pattern. The amino acids Gly43 and Val213 are in contact with the tripeptide Ser195-Gly196-Gly197 (Fig. 2A, Table 1). Main-chain atoms of Gly43 form a hydrogen bond with Ser195: N/Gly43-O/Ser195, and a weak hydrogen bond with Gly196: O/Gly43-CA/Gly196. Similar to Gly43, main-chain atoms of Val213 form two hydrogen bonds with the dipeptide Gly196-Gly197 (N/Val213-O/Gly197 and O/Val213-N/Gly196); the tetrapeptide Asp194-Gly197 forms a \u03b2-turn (data not shown). Main-chain atoms of Gly43 and Val213 are also in contact with the dipeptide Ser54-Ala55 from the PROSITE TRYPSIN_HIS pattern: contacts O/Gly43-OG/Ser54 and O/Val213-CB/Ala55 are shown ( Fig. 2A) . The group of connected amino acids presented in Fig. 2A we have named the 43/213 Nucleophile-Base Catalytic Zone (43/213-NBCZone) of trypsin. Unlike the 43/213-NBCZone, which incorporates only two amino acids of the PROSITE TRYPSIN_HIS pattern, Ser54 and Ala55, the entire PROSITE TRYPSIN_HIS pattern is included into the neighboring 42/43 Base Catalytic Zone, which contains the pentapeptide Ser54-Ala55-Ala56-His57-Cys58 and the dipeptide Cys42-Gly43 (Fig. 2B). Cys58 and Cys42 of this zone are linked by a disulfide bond, which maintains the conformation of the polypeptide chain near the active site. In addition, these two cysteines have contacts with the Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 main-chain oxygen of the catalytic nucleophile (",

            "text": "The importance of alanine at position 55 T for the catalytic activity of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases has been established [16, 17] . Using the human plasmin model as an example, it was shown that replacing the alanine residue with a threonine leads to the formation of an unusual hydrogen bond between this threonine and the catalytic histidine [16] . The peculiarity of this interaction is that the catalytic histidine now adopts an inactive conformation. In contrast, with the bovine protein C as an example, replacing this alanine with a hydrophobic valine does not cause major changes in the conformation of the catalytic histidine [17] . (Table S1 ). C1r/C1s and MASP-1/-2/-3 form a family of mosaic serine proteases with identical domain organization [18] , functioning as supramolecular complexes [19] . In each of the five mosaic serine proteases, two loops structurally corresponding to trypsin loop A (34 T -41 T ) and loop B (56 T -64 T ) [20] contact each other during the formation of such complexes [21] [22] [23] . In trypsin, cysteine at position 42 T is located at the carboxy-terminal end of loop A, and cysteine at position 58 T is placed at the amino-terminal end of loop B. Perhaps because of the need to form the supramolecular complexes, disulfide bonds are missing in all but MASP-1. As the analysis of the MASP-2 structure (PDB ID: 3TVJ, [22] ) shows, despite the absence of a disulfide bond, contacts between amino acids at positions 42 T , 58 T and the catalytic nucleophile are conserved (Table J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases, the residue is not absolutely conserved. Asparagine is observed at position 55 T in Homo sapiens HtrA and Arabidopsis thaliana Do-like serine proteases (8 proteases, Tables 1 and S1), joined together into HtrA family [25, 26] . In these enzymes the 54 T position is occupied by only threonine, and thus, this group of HtrA family proteases was named the \"TN group\". Because in the TN group the 55 T position is occupied by an asparagine and not by an alanine like in the [ST] A group, the 55 T -213 T interaction ( Fig.   2A ) is modified such that instead of the CB atom of alanine, the main chain oxygen of amino acid at position 213 T interacts with the ND2 atom of asparagine (e.g. ND2/Asn196-O/Asn321 in human mitochondrial serine protease HtrA2 (PDB ID: 5M3N, [27] ; Table 1 , Fig. 2C ).",

This structural feature of the prokaryotic SplE protein is discussed in detail in the work [32] . (Tables 2 and S2) . However, all of these proteases have a water molecule at position X. This is due to the removal of the side chain of amino acid 43 T from position X as a result of a break in the course of the polypeptide chain in this place. Currently there are no data on the existence of the activation structure changes near the catalytic site in SPATE family proteases.

The connection between the structural specificity of a group and the presence of a water molecule is also supported by the existence of a similar water molecule in immunoglobulin A1 protease (43&[STG][AV] group), which was described earlier. However, the structural reasons for the presence of the water near the residues at positions 54 T and 43 T in these six proteins are not entirely clear. It can only be assumed that the replacement of a direct contact of amino acids at positions 54 T and 43 T with water-mediated contacts demonstrates a weakening of the interaction of the nucleophilic loop with a \u03b2-sheet containing the catalytic base and the catalytic acid. This weakening is somehow related to the functional characteristics of these six proteins. In conclusion, we note that the presence of water molecules in a similar place in (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases has not been previously established. In the [TA]N and 43&[VR]N groups of cysteine proteases, rotation of the side chain of asparagine at position 55 T is observed, as has already been noted for the representative of the TN group of eukaryotic and prokaryotic serine proteases.

In particular, at position 194 T of TN group proteases there is asparagine instead of aspartate found at this position in the [ST]A group. Given the conservative changes in amino acids at positions 43 T , 55 T , and 194 T and the absence of the disulfide bond 42 T -58 T , it seems that proteases of the TN group do not have the ability to undergo a structural transition of the zymogen-zyme type. It is possible that this rule applies also to the complement factors C2 and B. This assumption is fully supported by the literatureTA and TN groupsOnly two examples of the NBCZone extension in prokaryotic TA group proteases with the zyme (chymo)trypsin-like form and two examples of the NBCZone extension with the zymogen form were found in the PDB: trypsins from Saccharopolyspora erythraea (PDB ID: 5KWM,[62]) and Streptomyces griseus (PDB ID: 1SGT,[63]), VESB and VesC proteases from Vibrio cholerae (PDB ID: 4LK4,[64] and PDB ID: 6BQM,[65]) (Tables 2 and S2). In terms of the organization of (chymo)trypsin-like zyme and zymogen forms, eukaryotic and prokaryotic NBCZone extensions of these four proteases are not different. Therefore, in the eukaryotic TA group proteases, the (chymo)trypsin-like form of NBCZone extension is dominant but in the prokaryotic proteases of this group it is auxiliary.Most prokaryotic TA group proteases have the amino acid serine or threonine at position 43 T , and possess glycine at position 197 T (Table S1). In the corresponding TN group, all proteases have serine or threonine at position 43 T , and glycine or serine at position 197 T . As a result, in the cases where glycine is not located at position 43 T and 197 T , there are no water molecules at positions X and Y, but atoms of the side chains of serine or threonine are located there instead. Among the prokaryotic TN group proteases, there is one exception from the viewpoint of building a zyme NBCZone extension pattern. With the serine protease SplE (Table S1, PDB ID: 5MM8, [32]) the dipeptide 193 T -194 T has a different conformation compared to the conformation of the corresponding dipeptide in the remaining proteases. As a result, the contact of the side-chain atom of the amino acid at position 43 T with the main-chain oxygen of amino acid at position 193 T is absent (Thr25 and Gly153, respectively, in the serine protease SplE). Earlier, we stated that, apparently, only members of eukaryotic and prokaryotic [ST]A groups can demonstrate two alternative conformations of the NBCZone extension pattern: zyme and zymogen. The NBCZone extension pattern of SplE shows that, sometimes, neither zyme nor zymogen form is possible. Instead a third form is formed, which is an atypical variant. Therefore, the letter A (Atypical) is added to the number of the structures of this protease and to the numbers of all similar structures in",

As a result, there is no water molecule in position X, except among the four viral cysteine 3C proteases from the [\u03a8C][PQ] group (Tables 2 and S2) [66]. Besides a greater number of such viral structures, there is another difference between prokaryotic and viral proteases.
