            "text": "Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) remains an important cause of mortality among children worldwide. In 2008 AGE in children ranged in third place as a cause of mortality after neonatal disease and pneumonia (1) . Many different pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and parasites, are associated with AGE. Their prevalence varies among world regions. Enteric viruses are among the most important pathogens contributing to the high disease burden in developed and developing regions (2) . A systematic review of AGE mortality in children revealed that the four major pathogens, rotaviruses, caliciviruses, enteropathogenic and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, account for more than half of all AGE deaths in children <5 years of age in the world (3) . In developed countries, mortality for AGE is low but the incidence of infectious diarrhea remains high, despite better hygiene conditions. In these countries, viruses are more prevalent than bacterial pathogens (3, 4) . However, in the last few years, rotavirus vaccine has contributed to a significant reduction of the disease burden, especially in countries with high vaccination coverage (5) (6) (7) (8) . In such an environment a substantial decrease in rotavirus disease and overall AGE cases was noted, increasing consequently the (relative) importance of other enteric pathogens in AGE (3, 9, 10) .",

The relatively low proportion of noroviruses, which are a recognized cause of AGE in patients who need hospitalization, was not a surprise because they are mostly found in older children and in adults (44) . As shown in countries with a high rotavirus vaccination coverage, such as Austria, Finland and Belgium (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) , the vaccination effectively prevents severe cases of AGE and drastically decreases the hospitalization rate for diarrhea. Significant reduction of RoV-related and overall AGE incidence may consequently result in higher relative importance of NoV in AGE (9, 10, 46, 50) . However, in Slovenia, where RoV vaccine has been available and recommended since 2007, only 26.9% of children were fully vaccinated in 2009, and the proportion was even lower (19.7%) in 2013 (National Institute of Public Health, Slovenia). The vaccination coverage in our country is probably too low for major epidemiological changes in AGE but could be associated with minor changes in RoV epidemiology observed after the introduction of the vaccine (51).",

            "text": "Since the presence of microbes in stool does not confirm their causal association with AGE, we tried to assess their clinical significance with the inclusion of a control group of children without diarrhea, and by measurement of the microorganism's burden in the stool specimen by semi-quantitative PCR assays (low Ct value indicating high burden and vice versa). The latter approach is based on the premise that the chances of a causal relationship are greater with a higher burden than with a lower burden (52) . Of 11 viral targets detected in stool specimens, only RoV, NoV-II, AdV, AstV and PeV were significantly more frequent in patients with AGE than in the control group without diarrhea (Table 1 ). This finding suggests that the role of other viruses is questionable and that they are probably not clinically important pathogens in children <6 years old, hospitalized for AGE. Our results also corroborated previous reports indicating that CoV (53), HSaV and BoV (54, 55) are rarely found in children <6 years old, who are hospitalized for AGE, and suggest that the causal relationship between these and several other viruses detected in the present study and AGE is questionable. The conclusion is further supported by the fairly high Ct values for the viruses and by the finding that a significantly lower mean Ct value in AGE than in the control group was found only for rotavirus but not for other viruses ( Table 1 ). The same is probably valid also for PeV: even though it is ranked the second most common virus demonstrated in stool specimens and was found more often in patients with AGE than in control patients, the low viral burden (comparable to those found in the control group) and very frequent co-presence of other potential etiologic agents of AGE do not reliably support its clinical significance (Table 1 and 4) . According to the literature, the role of PeV in AGE has not been completely elucidated. Some authors have supported an etiologic role of PeV in gastroenteritis, especially for genotypes 1, 2, 4-8 (56), while others have reported the detection of PeV in stool irrespective of clinical presentation (57) . NoVI, HSaV, CoV, BoV1, BoV2/4, BoV3, and PeV thus do not need to be included in the routine diagnostic approaches in hospitalized children <6 years old with AGE. However, there might be some differences in the relative frequencies of enteric pathogens in various geographical regions in the world, suggesting the need for appropriate evaluation of the relevant diagnostic list for enteric pathogens. Bacterial pathogens were much less prevalent than viruses in AGE. This finding was expected and agrees with results from Europe, USA and Australia, where bacterial pathogens have been shown to contribute 5-20% of gastroenteritis cases in this age group (43, 58) . In the present study, only C. jejuni/coli and Salmonella sp. were found significantly more often in children with AGE than in control persons, while E. coli and C. difficile were not. As reported previously, small children are frequently colonized with C. difficile; they provide a potential reservoir for toxigenic strains of C. difficile and are an important factor in pathogen circulation (59) . In the present study, the detection rate was the highest among infants 0-6 months, and was very low in children >36 months old; the age pattern corroborates previous reports (59, 60) . Other clues for a dubious etiologic role of C. difficile in small children with AGE were the finding that C. difficile was detected as the sole agent in the stool specimen in only 2/24 cases and the fact that the C. difficile burden was very low and comparable to that found in the control group.",

However, intimin positive samples, not considered to be EPEC, may represent additional pathogenic potential (33) . Nevertheless, as with C. difficile, the occurrence of E. coli was also comparable in patients with AGE and in the control group, and in only 3/30 children with AGE was it the only agent found in a stool specimen (one EPEC O88, one EPEC O26 and one EAggEC strain). Cohen et al (61) suggested that in children, diarrheagenic E. coli may represent up to 10% of gastroenteritis cases but may be present in the stool of asymptomatic children and coincide with other viral infections. This conclusion correlates very closely with our results and suggests that the detection of E. coli in children should be interpreted with caution and together with other microbiological results and clinical observations. While parasites are an important cause of childhood diarrhea in the developing world (62) , their carriage in stool is low in children living in Europe (63, 64) where especially Cryptosporidium spp. and G. duodenalis are mostly detected (65) . Though G. duodenalis is considered to be one of the commonest parasites of humans globally and giardiasis is the most common notifiable protozoan disease in patients in Slovenia (National Institute of Public Health, Slovenia), the course of giardiasis is less acute, which might explain its low prevalence in our study, which encompassed patients with diarrhoea duration of <10 days. The predominance of zoonotic C. parvum over other Cryptosporidium spp. in human cryptosporidiosis in Slovenia is in agreement with the study conducted by Soba and Logar (66) and might reflect the predominantly rural origin of the patients.",

In our study, 41.8% of samples obtained from children with AGE contained more than one potentially relevant pathogen, which is slightly more than reported elsewhere (13, 15, (67) (68) (69) . Previous studies have shown that viral load is of clinical importance for at least some viral pathogens (52, (70) (71) (72) . In our study, viral pathogens with a clear role in gastroenteritis, such as group A rotaviruses, had much lower Ct values than other viruses, such as PeV, BoV, and HSaV. Although Ct values of different targets cannot be compared directly, large differences in Ct values between co-detected viruses (differences in mean Ct value between targets >7) probably suggest important viral load differences (Table 1) . It would be of interest to obtain absolute quantitative data using new quantification methods, such as digital PCR (73) .",

With the implementation of such methods, co-infections will be noted more often. In order to obtain a more balanced delineation of a potential pathogen role in the disease, information on (viral) burden would be helpful and the inclusion of a control group(s) is needed. However, the most powerful combination for accurate diagnostics remains a combination of reliable analytical data in conjunction with careful clinical observations. A limitation of our study was the relatively low number of controls, which were not precisely matched, resulting in a significant difference in age in sex between cases and controls. The observed boy predominance in the control group was probably due to sexrelated differences in elective surgical procedures, such as inguinal hernia repair, which has been shown to be more prevalent in boys than in girls and testicular retention surgery.",

Using such an approach, the etiology of AGE was established in 83.5%. We believe that the proposed testing scheme is applicable not only in Slovenia but also in other geographic regions, but the testing algorithm should be evaluated based on epidemiologic investigation for specific region. Molecular multiplex methods are the best choice since they offer rapid, specific and sensitive diagnostics. An important challenge is the co-presence of several agents and the interpretation of such \"multiple infections\"; the challenge could be at least partially resolved by acquiring quantitative data for viral targets.
