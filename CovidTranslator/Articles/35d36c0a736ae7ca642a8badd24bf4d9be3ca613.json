These studies included patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARs, n=33), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS, n=16), COVID-19 (n=3), and unspecified coronavirus (n=2). The most common treatment was ribavirin (n=41), followed by oseltamivir (n=10) and the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (n=7). Additional therapies included broad spectrum antibiotics (n=30), steroids (n=39) or various interferons (n=12). No eligible studies examining monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19 were identified. One trial found that ribavirin prophylactic treatment statistically significantly reduced risk of MERS infection in people who had been exposed to the virus. Of the 21 studies reporting rates of ICU admission in hospitalized SARS or MERS patients, none reported statistically significant results in favour of or against antiviral therapies. Of the 40 studies reporting mortality rates in hospitalized SARS or MERS patients, one cohort study (MERS) and one retrospective study (SARS) found a statistically significant increase in the mortality rate for patients treated with ribavirin. Eighteen studies reported potential drugrelated adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, anemia, and altered liver function in patients receiving ribavirin.",

All of the included studies were published between 2003 and 2020 with the majority conducted in Hong Kong (n=14), followed by China (n=12), Saudi Arabia (n=10), Canada (n=5), South Korea (n=4), Taiwan (n=3), and one each from France, Germany, Greece, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States.

The risk of bias in the 3 included trials was overall difficult to judge due to a lack of adequate descriptions of study methods ( Figure 2 ). All three of the trials were at high or unclear risk of bias on the following components: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding of participants/personnel (Appendix 5). The cohort studies were of fair quality overall; most of the studies suffered from a lack of representative sampling (n=8), failed to demonstrate that the outcomes of interest were not present at the start of the study (n=8), or failed to adequately ensure the comparability of cohorts (n=4; Figure 3 ).

There were however important safety signals identified in the included studies, particularly the possible development of anemia and altered liver function in patients receiving ribavirin treatment. It is similarly difficult to recommend a particular antiviral drug as a promising candidate for further investigation due to the variable quality and inconclusive results of the current evidence. This review does show however that the existing body of evidence is weighted heavily towards studies of ribavirin which has shown no particular efficacy in treating coronavirus and may in fact cause harmful adverse effects. Future investigations into potential antiviral therapies for coronavirus may be best served by pointing their attention to other drug candidates.",
