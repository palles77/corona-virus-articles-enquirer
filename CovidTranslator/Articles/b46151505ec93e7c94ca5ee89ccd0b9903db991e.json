The contemporary spread and increased lability of various infectious diseases, new and old, reflect the combined and increasingly widespread impacts of demographic, environmental, behavioural, technological and other rapid changes in human ecology. Modern clinical medicine has, via blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and the use of hypodermic syringes, created new opportunities for microbes. These have contributed to the rising iatrogenic problems of hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS and several other viral infections. Meanwhile, the injudicious use of antibiotics has been a rare instance of human action actually increasing 'biodiversity'.",

During the past four decades, a major pandemic of cholera has occurred. This is the seventh pandemic since cholera, reinforced with its newly acquired toxin-producing genotype, first extended its range beyond south Asia in 1817. That initial spread occurred as a result of the Great Kumbh religious festival in the Upper Ganges, in which great numbers of pilgrims from all over India came to bathe in the sacred waters. Their subsequent dispersal, in association with British troop movements in the northwest frontier region, led to a cholera pandemic that spread from India to the Arabian peninsula and along the trade routes to Africa and the Mediterranean coast.",

The strain is the El Tor strain, which, in the midtwentieth century, appeared to replace the more lethal classical biotype of the nineteenth-century pandemics. Nevertheless, the extraordinary scale of this pandemic seems unlikely to reflect, predominantly, the biology of the bacterium. Rather, the scale and persistence of the pandemic is thought largely to reflect the greatly increased volume of human movement between continents, the greater rapidity and distance of modern shipping-based trade, the escalation in nutrient enrichment of coastal and estuarine waters by phosphates and nitrates in run-off wastewater, and the proliferation of urban slums without access to safe drinking water.

However, several major diseases, including malaria and dengue, occur across many ecosystems. Malaria is transmitted by 26 different species of anopheline mosquitoes, each of them dominant in particular habitats and locations. Because each species responds differently to a specified land use change, it is difficult to generalize the impact of ecosystem change effects across regions. Some other diseases such as yellow fever, however, can be transferred across ecosystems. The disease's natural, sylvatic, zoonotic cycle is between mosquitoes and monkeys high in forest canopies, but yellow fever can move into savannah, agricultural, and even urban areas in the wake of human economic activities such as logging or forest clearing.",

Influenza viruses, when replicating in infected humans or animals, can undergo genetic rearrangement. For example, different subtypes of influenza A virus can swap genes, thereby producing a novel subtype with an altered antigenic profile, and this new subtype may on occasion be particularly virulent. This scrambling of genetic material, albeit usually minor, serves to ensure that animals and Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2004) humans remain susceptible to the virus during each subsequent season.

Dengue is numerically the most important vector-borne viral disease of humans. Approximately 80 million cases are reported every year, of which ca. 20 000 die. Although dengue is primarily a tropical disease, it has extended in recent decades to countries with temperate climates. This reflects the increase in the number of imported cases, resulting from increased air travel, and the introduction of an exotic vector, Aedes aegypti, adapted to a cold climate (Kuno 1995) .",
