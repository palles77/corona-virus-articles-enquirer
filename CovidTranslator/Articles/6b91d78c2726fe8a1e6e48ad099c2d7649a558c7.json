In the case of virus infections of the central nervous system (CNS), these defense mechanisms are severely restricted by the immunological privilege of the CNS.

This hypothesis is supported by the demonstration that measles-virus-specific antibodies specifically induce an increase in inositoltriphosphate, which can act as a second messenger in the activation of protein kinase C in cells infected with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis virus (SSPE) 11. Alternatively, it is possible that the antibody exerts its inhibitory activity on virus transcription after it is taken up by the infected cell.

Although a specific saturable transfer mechanism for IgG at this barrier has been demonstrated 12, such a transport system is saturated at normal physiological IgG levels. Thus it seems very unlikely that sufficient quantities of administered antibody can infiltrate the brain parenchyma. However, in the virus-infected brain, the endothelial barriers that normally restrict extravasation of bloodborne proteins may become sus- ceptible to endothelial cellular passage 13. During inflammatory processes in the CNS, soluble factors such as histamine and cytokines are produced that can cause 'leakiness' of the capillary endothelium, thus providing the route for antibody passage. Indeed, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier occurs in the course of several viral CNS infections 14, although predominantly in the terminal stages of the disease when neuronal damage is extensive and antibody treatment is not effective.",

Since antibodymediated clearance can take place in the absence of inflammation, a different mechanism for extravasation of antibody into the brain parenchyma must exist. It is possible that neurons and probably also microglial cells respond to virus infection in a unique fashion. Virus infection may trigger a complex cascade of events in these cells, such as activation of immediate early gene expression followed by stimulation of late genes, which might result in the production of a variety of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. The release of neurotransmitters from neurons can induce vasodilation and plasma ex-travasation (Fig. 2) . In particular, the tachykinins substance P (SP) and neurokinin A are potent inducers of plasma extravasation at physiological concentrations 15. SPinduced extravasation has not yet been demonstrated for the CNS, although this mechanism operates in the periphery 16. The observation that SP gene expression is increased in the brain during the early phases of rabies virus infection (B. Dietzschold, unpublished) supports the hypothesis that activation of neuronal function in early stages of virus infection is an essential factor in the antibodymediated virus clearance.",

Because pathogens typically encounter an extremely iron-limiting environment when attempting to colonize or invade mammalian hosts, the role of iron in microbial infections has been the subject of numerous investigations 1. Although there is a substantial amount of this element present in the host, most of it is complexed and there is little or no free iron to support microbial growth. The iron is predominantly intracellular, occurring as heme, iron-sulfur proteins or ferritin, with smaller quantities in other iron proteins.

It has been observed in experimental models and in humans with abnormalities of iron metabolism that the incidence of fungal and bacterial infections increases under conditions of iron overload. Similarly, reduced iron levels are associated with enhanced resistance to infection.",

            "text": "The ability of microorganisms to compete successfully with the host for iron is an important determinant of their virulence. A variety of iron acquisition systems that may function within the host have been identified, and there is now evidence to show that some of the components are virulence factors. One mechanism of microbial iron acquisition in vivo is the direct utilization of host iron sources. Although transferrin and lactoferrin withhold iron from many microbes and inhibit their growth, some pathogens have been found to bind transferrin and/or lactoferrin and to remove and utilize the iron associated with these proteins. They include the pathogenic Neisseria 2, Hemophilus influenzae 3, and the flagellated protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis 4. The Neisseria gonorrhoeae transferrin receptor has been cloned and characterized 2. Its amino acid sequence is similar to that of other bacterial iron transport receptors. Another potential iron source for pathogens in the host is heme. The ability to use heme, even complexed to hemoglobin, is characteristic of many pathogens such as Hemophilus 5 and Vibrio cholerae 6. When starved for iron, V.",
