So accurate evaluation of these measures helps to maximize the effectiveness of prevention and control while minimizing social costs. In this paper, we develop the model in Dirk Brockmann and Dirk Helbing (2013) to theoretically explain the impact mechanism of traffic control and social distancing measures on the spread of the epidemic, and empirically tests the effect of the two measures in China at the present stage using econometric approach. We found that both traffic control and social distancing measures have played a very good role in controlling the development of the epidemic. Nationally, social distancing measures are better than traffic control measures; the two measures are complementary and their combined action will play a better epidemic prevention effect; Traffic control and social distancing do not work everywhere. Traffic control only works in cities with higher GDP per capita and population size, while fails in cities with lower GDP per capita and population size. In cities with lower population size, social distancing becomes inoperative; the rapid and accurate transmission of information, a higher protection awareness of the public, and a stronger confidence of residents in epidemic prevention can promote the realization of the measure effects. The findings above verify the effectiveness and correctness of the measures implemented in China at present, at the same time, we propose that it is necessary to fully consider the respective characteristics of the two measures, cooperating and complementing each other; what's more, measures should be formulated according to the city's own situation, achieving precise epidemic prevention; Finally, we should increase the transparency of information, improve protection awareness of the public, guide emotions of the public in a proper way, enhancing public confidence.",

            "text": "The stringent control measures in China quickly brought the epidemic under control. By February 18, the number of diagnosed cases in Wuhan reached a peak of 38,020, and in other regions reached a peak of 13,886 on February 14, then the number of new cases began to gradually decrease. By March 18, for the first time, there were no new cases within China, and the stock of diagnosed cases fell to 7,263. The prevention and control of COVID-19 have mainly shifted to controlling imported cases overseas. However, of the 32 province-level administrative regions in mainland China, 6 have fewer than 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 13 were between 100 -500 cases and only 5 have more than 1,000 cases, namely Hubei, Guangdong, Henan, Zhejiang, and Hunan. There were no COVID-19 cases in 19 of 334 prefecture-level administrative regions across the country, and more than a third of the 2,851 county-level administrative regions did not occur. In other words, the epidemic in more than half of the country is very mild, while Tibet has only one imported case, but they all have adopted a Level \u2160 emergency response without exception. The Level \u2160 emergency response means a suspension of economic activity in all regions of the country, with costs that are difficult to estimate. One percentage reduction in China's GDP growth rate means a loss of more than 830 billion yuan. At the same time, strict measures to control COVID-19 epidemic will cause economic depression and rising unemployment, as well as increase the number of abnormal death (suicide and malnutrition, insufficient medical care, etc.). Therefore, when the epidemic in China is effectively controlled, it is necessary to reflect on whether it is necessary to implement comprehensive control in regions where there are no infected cases? How much prevention and control is needed to be effective in regions with different epidemic severity?",

Third, this paper incorporates the proposed effective distance into the model for regression, breaking through the past practice of estimating the scale of epidemic spread based on geographical distance. Fourth, this paper uses Python and other big data mining methods to mine and sort out the prevention and control measures adopted in China and the time taken, as well as the Baidu Search Index \"COVID-19\", \"the correct wearing of masks\", \"Zhong Nanshan\" to represent information dissemination, public awareness of protection and Confidence in fighting the epidemic.",

            "text": "Some literature studies the method that the medical staff treats emerging infectious diseases to reduce or avoid transmission. Koenig (2015) proposed the 3I tool, namely Identify-Isolate-Inform, which is considered to be the normative process for medical staff to treat emerging infectious diseases. The 3I tool has been modified for the prevention and control of infectious diseases such as MERS, measles, Zika virus, mumps, and hepatitis A, and has achieved good results. Triage is an important part of early detection of patients with infectious diseases, effective prevention of the spread of infectious diseases, and better protection of medical staff (Kisting et al., 2012) . Medical staff must have a sufficient understanding of emerging infectious diseases. When encountering suspected patients, it's necessary to ask for medical history in time, to identify potential patients as early as possible, and to make isolation and protection. If a person is suspected to be infected, isolation is required, including the transfer of the patient to another designated place for treatment or direct placement of the patient into an isolation ward. Isolation is an important measure, but there are differences between isolation and quarantine. Quarantine refers to the separation of individuals who may have been exposed to an infectious disease or pathogens but still healthy from those who are healthy and have not been exposed (Chea et al., 2014) . In other words, quarantine is to conduct observation on healthy people who may have been exposed to infectious diseases and may spread the disease to others to determine whether they are truly infected. The concept of observation originated from \"border screening\" (Selvey et al., 2015) . It was originally used for the entry and exit ports, and then expanded the concept to refer to measures taken by people who may be exposed to the disease before symptoms are identified, which are quarantine measures and have no place limitations. For example, people who do not need to be hospitalized can be quarantined at home while being assessed for MERS infection Koenig et al., 2017) . During the observation, once symptoms are identified and the infection is confirmed, quarantine should be switched to isolation. Diseases listed for quarantine must be diseases that pose a serious threat to public health, such as cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fever, SARS, and influenza which may cause a pandemic (Koenig, 2012) .",

If the symptoms are not contagious before onset, the travel and social distance will not be limited, but necessary disease surveillance should be carried out to determine whether the intervention of public health agencies is needed to ensure the effectiveness of the latent disease surveillance based on the monitoring effect. Different public health measures need to be selected based on the disease to which the individual assessed is exposed. On the other hand, the difference transmission can significantly affect the speed of disease spreading and the choice of personal protective equipment (PPE). At the same time, legal basis, jurisdiction, impact on mental health and the potential negative consequences of restrictions on human rights and free actions need to be considered. The scientific significance of quarantine lies in the fact that quarantined disease is likely to spread during the incubation period to minimize the probability of infectious disease outbreaks (Barbisch et al., 2015) . The third step of the 3I tool is to promptly report to the infection control department of hospitals, superior supervisors, and law enforcement departments based on the location of the identified and confirmed patient.",

            "text": "Another part of the literature assesses the effectiveness and the scope of application of public health policies. Rothstein & Talbott (2007) found that to make quarantine to be the most effective measure for limiting the spread of infection, compliance with quarantine regulations should be encouraged, that is, providing job security and income replacement. Wang et al. (2012) found that In the case of short reaction time, intra-population, such as patient isolation, are more effective than inter-population such as travel restrictions. Jefferson (2008) pandemic influenza (H1N1) and found those were effective to some extent. Rashid (2015) researched the public health policy of the 2009 pandemic influenza and concluded that the school closure, whether positive or passive, seemed to be moderately effective and acceptable in reducing the spread of influenza and delaying the peak of the epidemic, but it is related to high expenses of secondary school. Voluntary isolation and quarantine at home are also effective and acceptable measures, but it takes the risk of intra-household transmission from index cases to contacts. Workplace-related interventions, such as work closure and work at home, are also moderately effective and acceptable, but it may have negatively impact on economy. Internal mobility restriction is only effective when extremely high restrictions (50% of travel) are imposed and mass gatherings which happened within 10 days before the epidemic peak is likely to increase the risk of transmission of influenzas. Rothstein (2015) compared the effectiveness of public health policies to intervene with infectious diseases, among which quarantine is one of the most aggressive and controversial measures that public health officials can take when trying to control an outbreak. Serious legal and ethical concerns have been raised because of restrictions on the movement of potentially large numbers of people (Fidler et al., 2007) . During the SARS epidemic in 2003, quarantine was widely used in several Asian countries and Canada, and it played a role in ending the epidemic. Similarly, during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, social distancing measures, including quarantine, had become a major containment strategy. The paradox of quarantine and other social distancing measures is that they may effectively resist the outbreak of disease, but the scope of application is too wide, leading to various social hazards, including economic disruption, physical isolation and even violence. Quarantine is the first public health tool to control infectious diseases and remains a legitimate and valuable public health strategy because it has a significant impact on civil liberties, economic activity and social cohesion, so officials must be extra careful about the possibility of abusing quarantine authority (Rothstein, 2015) .",

Different from isolation, quarantine is to separate those who are still healthy but possibly exposed to an infective agent from those who are healthy but have not been exposed, which is a restriction on the movement or communication of persons or the transport of goods in order to prevent the spread of disease (Gostin & Wiley, 2016) . Shelter-inplace (SIP) is a variant of quarantine, in which individuals are not restricted at a designated location, but at where they were at the time (e.g. Family). Cordon sanitaire refers to restricting activities of the individual in a larger and more defined geographic area (such as a community).",

Comparing with quarantining at a designated place, the advantage of cordon sanitaire is that it tends to keep the community intact, including its basic resources, businesses, and infrastructure. A method that is the opposite of it is called protective sequestration, which means that unaffected communities separate themselves from the outside until there is no risk of an outbreak. Social distancing is a voluntary, recommended restriction on physical contacts, such as staying at home and avoiding public places and activities. Some less drastic, but quite effective and more frequently used measures of social distancing include canceling mass gatherings, school, and workplace closures, travel restrictions, etc. Wilder-Smith (2020) believed that SARS-CoV has now been eliminated, indicating that we can completely stop this epidemic and interrupt person-to-person transmission. In the absence of vaccines and antivirals, only strict implementation of traditional public health measures made this remarkable achievement possible. In the early stages, isolating patients is particularly effective in interrupting the spread of infectious diseases. Since the infected can spread before he is symptomatic, isolation is often too late to prevent transmission and contain the pandemic. Quarantine is one of the oldest and most effective tools for controlling outbreaks of infectious diseases (Cetron & Landwirth, 2005) , which possibly apply at the individual or group level and usually involves restrictions on houses or designated facilities. Social distancing aims to reduce interactions between people in the wider community, where individuals may be contagious but have not yet been identified and therefore have not been isolated. Social distancing is particularly useful where community transmission is considered to be occurring, but the links between cases are unclear, or where restrictions on the known contacts are not considered sufficient to prevent further spread. Social distancing includes closing schools or office buildings, suspending public markets, and canceling gathering. If these measures are considered inadequate, then a community-wide containment is likely to be required. A community-wide containment is an intervention that applies to an entire community, city, or region, aiming to reduce physical contact between people. Implementing a community-wide containment requires close partnerships and cooperation with law enforcement agencies at the local and state levels, and inspection stations are usually established, and legal penalties may be required if there is a violation.",

As for air travel, it's necessary to target at the main route to the source of influenza, and if 99% air travel restriction is implemented, the peak of the epidemic will be postponed for up to two weeks. Mao (2013) believed that it is not cost-effective to use travel restriction alone, but if 50% of travel restrictions are implemented, combined with antiviral prevention and workplace closure, it is the best strategy. For large urbanized areas, closing the affected workplaces can be an effective and cost-saving strategy to reduce flu outbreaks and it is also the most cost-effective. Folayan & Brown (2015) found that in order to control Ebola, more than 50 countries have issued travel restrictions on affected countries. However, travel restrictions have made it more difficult to tackle the disease, which is not a solution to contain Ebola, because it has become more difficult to deliver supplies, equipment and humanitarian assistance to the affected areas.",

With the rise of complexity science, the micro-modeling specification has been developed and combined with social networks, a network-based micro-individual modeling method has been proposed, which provides a new approach to understand the spread of infectious diseases. These models enable epidemiologists and health authorities to understand the transmission process, predict its impact on healthy populations, and assess the effectiveness of different mitigation and prevention strategies. But, in any case, the epidemic of infectious diseases is inseparable from two key factors, namely, person-to-person contact and population mobility. When infectious disease outbreaks, various countries adopt public health intervention policies, in which one is to control human contacts, such as isolation, quarantine, and social distancing; the other is to control population mobility, such as travel restrictions.",

If a city is abstracted into a node beyond the scale of micro-individuals, the population flow between cities is the key factor affecting the scale of virus transmission among cities, which is related to urban density and transportation. The meta-population model is a commonly used model for analyzing the spread of epidemics, which nodes are used to represent the city, and the linings are used to represent the traffic between cities, such as the plane, high-speed rail, bus and so on. Within each node, a certain number of people are set. Colizza et al. (2007) used a meta-population model to characterize human behavior on a global scale. They found that a large-scale epidemic would only erupt when the population density exceeded a certain threshold. When the scale of the network is infinite, a few large nodes (namely, important cities) in the network will cause an epidemic to outbreak globally. Regarding transportation, Brockmann & Helbing (2013) found that the spread of disease is closely related to the \"effective distance\" between cities rather than geographical distance.

In this paper, the various measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID -19 in China are divided into two categories: One is traffic control, which not only affects the movement of people across regions and even across the country, but also affects the transportation of goods. The price of this is to force companies and other institutions to stop operations, which is at huge cost. Another is social distancing, including closure of public places in the city, community containment, isolation of the infected, and quarantine of the suspected, which affects the operation of some urban institutions, and the cost is less than the traffic control. Based on the mechanism analyzed above and the classification of prevention and control measures against COVID-19, we then propose the hypothesis: traffic control and social distancing can quickly contain the spreads of COVID-19 epidemic, but they perform different effect in various regions.",

At the same time, the places with severe epidemic situation are more inclined to take more vigorous prevention and control measures, that is to say, the development of the epidemic situation will also reversely affect the local prevention and control efforts, so there is a problem of reverse causality. In order to address the endogenous problems caused by missing variables and reverse causality, we use the instrumental variable approach to re-estimate. The selection of instrument variables needs to meet two requirements: the first is that there is a significant relationship between the instrumental variables and the endogenous explanatory variables; and the second is that the instrument variable must be exogenous. We take the 1st lag of the explanatory variable as a instrument variable, and adopt the two stage least squares method (2SLS) and the generalized method of moment (GMM) to estimate it. Table 6 reports the estimated results of the instrumental variable approach. We can say that there is no obvious change in the sign and significance of the coefficients. The results of the instrumental variables approach are consistent with the baseline regression, indicating that the conclusion is still valid after considering endogeneity. Both the traffic control and social distancing have been effective in controlling the epidemic. Table 6 Instrumental Variable ",

The effect of traffic control measures is not ideal in regions with lower GDP.
