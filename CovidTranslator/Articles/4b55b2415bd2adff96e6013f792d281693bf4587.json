The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins can restrict entry of ebolaviruses, influenza A viruses, and other enveloped viruses. However, the breadth and mechanism of the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins are incompletely understood. Here, we employed ebolavirus glycoprotein-pseudotyped vectors and ebolavirus-like particles to address this question. We show that IFITM proteins inhibit the cellular entry of diverse ebolaviruses and demonstrate that type I interferon induces IFITM protein expression in macrophages, major viral targets. Moreover, we show that IFITM proteins block entry of influenza A viruses and ebolaviruses by different mechanisms and provide evidence that antibodies and IFITM proteins can synergistically inhibit cellular entry of ebolaviruses. These results provide insights into the role of IFITM proteins in infection by ebolaviruses and suggest a mechanism by which antibodies, though poorly neutralizing in vitro, might contribute to viral control in vivo.",

In contrast, RESTV is an Asian ebolavirus, which might be apathogenic in immunocompetent humans [6] . African [7] and Asian ebolaviruses [8] infect bats, which serve as a natural reservoir, and a related filovirus, Lloviu virus (LLOV; genus Cuevavirus), was identified in a European bat [9] . Thus, zoonotic transmission of ebolaviruses to humans can pose a significant threat to public health, and understanding virus-host cell interactions might yield insights into viral spread and pathogenesis and provide a basis for developing antiviral strategies.",

            "text": "The interferon (IFN) system is an integral component of the innate defenses against viral infection. The observation that ebolaviruses encode several IFN antagonists indicates that IFN-induced antiviral effector molecules can pose an effective blockade to viral spread [10] . The IFN-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 were shown to display antiviral activity against filoviruses and other viral pathogens [11] [12] [13] . Several studies suggest that IFITM proteins can block host cell entry of viruses by inhibiting the fusion of the viral membrane with an endosomal membrane. Thus, IFITM proteins inhibit influenza A virus (FLUAV) entry at the stage of hemifusion [14, 15] , possibly by inducing the accumulation of endosomal cholesterol [16] , although this mechanism is not undisputed [14, 17, 18] . Polymorphisms in the IFITM3 gene were shown by some studies [19, 20] but not all [21, 22] to be associated with increased susceptibility to severe influenza, indicating that IFITM3 poses a powerful block to FLUAV spread in infected humans. In contrast, it is presently unclear whether IFITM proteins inhibit entry of all African and Asian ebolaviruses as well as LLOV and whether they are expressed in major viral target cells. Finally, it remains to be determined whether IFITM proteins inhibit host cell entry of ebolaviruses and FLUAV by similar mechanisms. The present study addressed these questions, employing a vector system and novel EBOV-like reporter particles to analyze ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP)-driven entry into target cells and its inhibition by IFITM proteins.",

Expression of rhesus macaque IFITM proteins was readily detectable, although expression of IFITM3(1) was reduced compared with that of IFITM3(2) ( Figure 1C ).

In stark contrast, amphotericin B did not modulate EBOV-GP-driven entry (Figure 3 ), indicating that IFITM2 and IFITM3 inhibit FLUAV-HA-and EBOV-GPmediated entry via different mechanisms.",

These results were confirmed using a novel EBOV-like particle reporter system, which measures GLuc transcomplementation upon delivery of a VP40-fused GLuc fragment into cells expressing the complementary portion of GLuc ( Figure 4B ).

Mutation of SVKS in IFITM3, which had no appreciable effect on protein expression ( Figure 4C ), abrogated the blockade of EBOV-GP-driven entry and markedly augmented transduction mediated by LLOV-GP ( Figure 4D) . Similarly, cellular entry of EBOV-like particles bearing LLOV-GP was augmented by the SVKS mutant, and expression of this protein also increased EBOV-GP-dependent entry ( Figure 4E) . Thus, the SVKS motif is required for inhibition of EBOV-GP-and LLOV-GP-facilitated entry, and alteration of this motif can transform IFITM3 from an antiviral into a proviral factor.

We hypothesized that IFITM expression and antibodies directed against GP might synergistically inhibit GP-driven entry. To test this hypothesis, we assessed whether a poorly neutralizing antiserum raised in rabbits against EBOV-GP unfolds potent neutralizing activity when target cells are used that express IFITM proteins. The antiserum modestly inhibited EBOV-GP-driven entry into control cells (3-fold reduction) and had no appreciable effect on FLUAV-HA-and LASV-GPC-driven entry into these cells ( Figure 5 ). EBOV-GP-mediated transduction of IFITM1-and IFITM2-expressing cells was markedly reduced by the serum, whereas the effect on FLUAV-HA-and LASV-GPC-driven entry was absent or modest, respectively. Furthermore, the roughly 10-fold inhibition of EBOV-GP-driven entry on IFITM3 expression alone was increased to 1000-fold when vectors were incubated with GP-specific antiserum, and similar effects were not observed for FLUAV-HA and LASV-GPC, although an 8-10-fold augmentation of inhibition efficiency was measured ( Figure 5 ). Finally, preimmune serum did not modulate transduction efficiency, indicating that the effects observed were specific. Collectively, these results suggest that expression of IFITM3 and GP-specific antibodies might synergistically inhibit GP-driven entry.",

Interestingly, IFITM proteins might regulate a process that can either enhance or inhibit GP-driven entry, because an IFITM3 mutant markedly augmented LLOV-GP-dependent transduction. Moreover, evidence was obtained that IFITM proteins might inhibit FLUAV and EBOV entry via different mechanisms because the IFITM-mediated blockade of entry driven by FLUAV-HA but not EBOV-GP was rescued by amphotericin B treatment.

Moreover, IFITM expression was reported to inhibit host cell entry of authentic EBOV and MARV [12] , and our present findings demonstrate that entry of vectors pseudotyped with diverse filovirus GPs is also blocked. These observations indicate that IFITM proteins might constitute a panfiloviral defense in the infected host. This defense could slow down but not prevent viral spread and seems to be operative in humans and nonhuman primates, as evidenced by the blockade of filovirus-GP-driven entry by rhesus macaque IFITM proteins. Moreover, the panfiloviral inhibition suggests that all filovirus GPs, including LLOV-GP, depend on similar if not identical cellular factors and/or processes for host cell entry. This notion is in agreement with two recent reports [37, 38] indicating that the GPs of LLOV and EBOV use identical factors for attachment (C-type lectins) and entry (NPC1) and that entry driven by both GPs depends on GP proteolysis by endosomal cysteine proteases. The amount of GP incorporated into viral particles does not seem to modulate IFITM sensitivity. Thus, retroviral particles bearing low, intermediate, and high amounts of EBOV-GP and RESTV-GP exhibited comparable susceptibility to inhibition by IFITM proteins (Supplementary Figure 1) , indicating that the block imposed by IFITM proteins might not be saturable by excess GP copies presented at the virion surface. In sum, IFITM proteins are comparably active against entry driven by all filoviral GPs, although subtle differences in inhibition efficiency might have remained undetected owing to the limited resolution of our assay, and it will be interesting to examine the contribution of these proteins to the control of viral spread in the host. IFITM knockout mice [19, 39] might be suitable tools for these endeavors.",

However, subsequent work challenged this concept [14, 17, 18] , and reduction of endosomal cholesterol levels did not rescue EBOV-GP-driven entry from blockade by IFITM proteins in the present study (not shown). Recent studies revealed that the antimycotic compound amphotericin B disables IFITM-dependent inhibition of FLUAV [18] and retrovirus entry [40] in cell culture, and amphotericin B treatment of mice was shown to abrogate control of FLUAV infection [18] . The underlying mechanism was not fully clarified, but a role for membrane fluidity was suggested. The present study shows that IFITMs might block FLUAV-HA-and EBOV-GP-mediated entry via different mechanisms, since EBOV-GP-driven entry was not rescued by amphotericin B treatment. Thus, further work is required to clarify how GPdriven entry is inhibited. These studies might be aided by the observation that mutation of an SVKS motif-required for the antiretroviral activity of IFITM1 [25] and the anti-dengue/ FLUAV activity of IFITM3 [34] -potentiates LLOV-GP-driven entry, because it suggests that IFITM proteins might be able to positively and negatively regulate a cellular process critical for filovirus entry. This concept is in keeping with the finding that the human coronavirus OC43 can use IFITM proteins as cofactors for infectious viral entry into target cells [41] .",
