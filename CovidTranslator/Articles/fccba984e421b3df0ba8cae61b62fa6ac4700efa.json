This full-length sequence has been determined from the cDNA-clone Inf-1 that is based on the lab-adapted strain VR-740. Lab-adaptation might have resulted in genomic changes, due to insufficient pressure to maintain gene integrity of non-essential genes. We present here the first full-length genome sequence of two clinical isolates. Each encoded gene was compared to Inf-1. In general, little sequence changes were noted, most could be attributed to genetic drift, since the clinical isolates originate from 2009 to 2010 and VR740 from 1962. Hot spots of substitutions were situated in the S1 region of the Spike, the nucleocapsid gene, and the non-structural protein 3 gene, whereas several deletions were detected in the 3 0 UTR. Most notable was the difference in genome organization: instead of an ORF4A and ORF4B, an intact ORF4 was present in clinical isolates.",

Coronaviruses are enveloped, plus strand RNA viruses and belong to the Coronaviridae family. The genomes are linear, nonsegmented, and single strand. The coronavirus genomes with 27-31.5 kb in length are the largest of the known RNA viruses. The genomes are polycistronic generating a nested set of subgenomic RNAs with common 5 0 and 3 0 sequences [1] . Based on serologic and phylogenic relationship, coronaviruses are classified into three genera. Alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus consist of various mammalian coronaviruses, whereas gammacoronavirus includes bird viruses [2] . The genus of Alphacoronavirus includes transmissible gastroenteritis virus (also referred to as alphacoronavirus I; ICTV 2009), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, some bat coronaviruses, and the human coronaviruses (HCoVs) NL63 and 229E. In general, HCoV-229E virus causes common cold but occasionally it can be associated with more severe respiratory infections in children, elderly and persons with underlying illness [3] [4] [5] .",

Of the current HCoV-229E isolates, only limited sequence data have been obtained. Chibu and Birch [5] have investigated the evolution of HCoV-229E by sequencing part of the S and the N gene from clinical samples collected between 1979 and 2004.

Reverse transcription was performed at 37\u00b0C for 1 h using random hexamers and superscript II (Invitrogen). The HCoV-229E Inf-1 reference sequence (Accession number NC_002645.1) was used as scaffold for designing bidirectional PCR-primer combinations, amplifying an average fragment length of 500 bp with a minimum overlap of 80 bp with adjacent primer combinations. Primers sequences are available upon request. Amplification of the fragments was performed with the following thermal cycle profile: 5 min at 95\u00b0C, 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 55\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by a final elongation step of 7 min at 72\u00b0C. PCR fragments were visualized upon agarose gel electrophoreses by ethidium bromide staining. Positive PCR fragments were directly sequenced with their forward and reverse primers in both the directions. Sequencing reactions were performed according to the BigDye Terminator v1.1 protocol (ABI life science). Sequences were analyzed with Coloncode Aligner software (version 3.7.1). Sequences have been submitted to GenBank (JX503060, JX503061). 5 0 and 3 0 RACE In order to complete the full-genome sequence with 5 0 and 3 0 termini, 5 0 and 3 0 RACE was performed. The 5 0 end was determined with the 5 0 RACE kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufactures protocol. Gene-specific primers for 5 0 RACE PCR amplification were designed to flank approximately 100 nt of the 5 0 region. The 3 0 end of HCoV-229E clinical strain was determined with 3 0 RACE, with an RT reaction performed using the Oligo-dT-JZH primer and PCR amplification with the JZH primer and a gene-specific primer [9] .The PCR products were excised after agarose electrophoresis and purified with the Nucleospin Extract II kit (Machery-Nagel) according to the manufacture protocol. Purified PCR products were cloned into the pCRII-TOPO TA vector (invitrogen) and chemically competent E. Coli according to manufacture protocol (Top 10 cells, Invitrogen). Transformants were directly analyzed via colony PCR with T7 and M13Rev primers. PCR products were sequenced as described above.",

In the 1b replicase gene, there are 84 in 0349 and 81 in J0304 substitutions resulting in 20 and 19 amino acid changes, respectively. Furthermore, one deletion and an insertion were observed. The NSP3 gene encodes for the largest non-structural protein and comprises 1,594 amino acids residues. This protein is a multi-functional protein and acts as Papain-Like protease (PL pro) and also has catalytic activity [14] . In 0349 and J0304, we observed 74 nt substitutions (34 non-synonymous in 0349 and 33 in J0304), a 21 nt insertion at position 286, and a 6 nt deletion at the positions 316-321. The NSP4 gene is situated between the two autoproteolytical proteins NSP3 and NSP5. There are 21 nt substitutions in 0349 that cause five amino acid changes. In J0304, there are 19 substitutions, 4 of them are non-synonymous. NSP5 has a proteolytic role with cysteine protease activity. It is very important in viral replication and, therefore, often referred to as the main protease (Mpro) [14, 15] . The Mpro-mediated processing pathways are well conserved in all coronaviruses and it cleaves as many as 11 pp1a/pp1b sites to produce a total of 13 mature proteins [16] . Although there are 7 changes at nucleotide acid level in 0349, there is only one amino acid difference (E222D). The same for J0304 with 10 substitutions that cause only two changes in amino acid level (F12L and E222D). The NSP6 gene encodes a membrane-spanning protein [14] . Eight nucleotide substitutions are found in 0349 and 7 in J0304, of which one is non-synonymous (V86I). The HCoV-229E genome encodes several small non-structural proteins, like NSP7 to NSP10, that have RNA-binding activity and are believed to be involved in viral RNA synthesis [14] . There is one substitution in the NSP7 gene in 0349 and 3 in J0304 that have no effect on the encoded protein. In NSP8, there are 6 nt substitutions, all except one are synonymous (I179T). There are three nucleic acids substitutions in NSP9 of 0349 and five in J0304, one of them non-synonymous (T23I). Within the NSP10 gene there are 6 nt substitutions in 0349, including two that change the amino acid sequence (S18A and C57S). Although we have 8 nt substitutions in J0304, there is only one that has effect on amino acid level (C57S). NSP12, or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, consists of 927 amino acids. In 0349, there are 35 and in J0304 34 nt substitutions that result in 12 and 11 changes, respectively, in amino acid levels in comparison with the reference sequence (N4S, A32V, K131R, E134G, S147N, S233A, M458I, S524L, S757G, G767E, I842V, H906Q). Moreover, there is a difference in cleavage site between NSP10 and NSP12. In the reference, the cleavage site is TAIQ/SFDN, whereas it is TAIQ/SFDS in both clinical strains.",

Furthermore, two short deletions with lengths of 2 and 4 nt are observed in 0349, and a 4 nt deletion in J0304. The effect of such deletions on 3 0 UTR structure and function is unknown.

There is a highly conserved pseudoknot in all alphacoronaviruses but not a detectable counterpart of the bulged stem-loop in any proximity, upstream or downstream of the pseudoknot [22, 23] . Strain 0349 showed most substitution (7/8) and deletions in the first 150 nt of the 3 0 UTR.
