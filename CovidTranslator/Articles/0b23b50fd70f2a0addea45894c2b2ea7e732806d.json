            "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) is highly pathogenic. An immunosensor for the determination of MERS-CoV is described here. It is based on a competitive assay carried out on an array of carbon electrodes (DEP) modified with gold nanoparticles. Recombinant spike protein S1 was used as a biomarker for MERS CoV. The electrode array enables multiplexed detection of different CoVs. The biosensor is based on indirect competition between free virus in the sample and immobilized MERS-CoV protein for a fixed concentration of antibody added to the sample. Voltammetric response is detected by monitoring the change in the peak current (typically acquired at a working potential of \u22120.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl) after addition of different concentrations of antigen against MERS-CoV. Electrochemical measurements using ferrocyanide/ferricyanide as a probe were recorded using square wave voltammetry (SWV). Good linear response between the sensor response and the concentrations from 0.001 to 100 ng.mL \u22121 and 0.01 to 10,000 ng.mL \u22121 were observed for MERS-CoV and HCoV, respectively. The assay was performed in 20 min with detection limit as low as 0.4 and 1.0 pg.mL \u22121 for HCoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. The method is highly selective over non-specific proteins such as Influenza A and B. The method is single-step, sensitive and accurate. It was successfully applied to spiked nasal samples.",

It causes thousands of serious illness and hundreds of human life losses in Saudi Arabia and all over the world. Human respiratory infections caused by corona viruses (CoV) such as HCoV-229E and HCoVOC43 are known since 1960s [1] and later another few types of CoV have been discovered such as SARS-CoV, HCoV NL63 and HCoV HKU1 [2] . Severe respiratory illness in human due to MERS-CoV was first reported in June 2012 at Jeddah hospital in Saudi Arabia. Within short period of time, another patient with acute kidney injury and acute respiratory syndrome was reported in Qatar. In April 2012, two patients were found to be infected with MERS-CoV in Jordan [3] . Since MERS-CoV was identified, it spread over 23 countries. 1936 cases with 690 deaths (35.6% case fatality rate) have been reported by the WHO caused via MERS-CoV until 27 April 2017 [4] . In South Korea, an outbreak of 180 confirmed MERS-CoV infected cases and 36 deaths were recorded in May and June 2015 [5] .",

Various immunosensors have been reported for the detection of virus using different transducers as better alternative to traditional assays. For instance, the detection of SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in sputum in the gas phase was done by piezoelectric immunosensor. This work was based on the binding of horse polyclonal antibody of SARS-CoV to piezoelectric crystal surface through protein A. The mass of the crystal was changing and shift in the frequency was recorded upon virus binding [17] . Localized surface plasmon coupled fluorescence (LSPCF) fiber-optic biosensor was also developed for the detection of SARS corona virus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid protein N. LSP with sandwich immunoassay technique [18] . Label-free RNA amplification and detection method was developed for the detection of MERS-CoV by using bio-optical sensor. The LOD of this assay was 10 times more sensitive than rRT-PCR method [19] . Another new generation system was developed for the robust and facile diagnosis of MERS-CoV based on isothermal rolling circle amplification (RCA) method [20] . However, these methods are still time consuming and costly which limits their wide applications.",

The immunosensor is fabricated on array electrodes to enable the simultaneous detection of different types of CoV virus. This novel competitive immunosensor enables a single step, sensitive and selective detection of MERS-CoV and can be successfully applied in spiked nasal sample. Furthermore, the electrochemical immunosensor provides a low cost, high sensitivity, capability of miniaturization, and on-site high throughput screening of multiple samples.",

The biosensor is based on the indirect competition between the free virus in the sample and immobilized MERS-CoV protein for fixed concentration of added antibody to the sample. The detection was achieve by measuring the reduction peak current of ferro/ferricyanide redox couple after each step. The binding of the antibody to the immobilized protein would lead to a decrease in the SWV reduction peak current. This reduction in the peak current is attributed to the coverage of the electrode surface with the bulky sized antibodies (the antibodies in general have a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa). This coverage of the surface with the antibody retards the access of the ferro/ferri cyanide redox couple to the conductive surface and therefore reduces the electron transfer efficiency which in turn leads to a decrease in the current.

Square wave voltammetry was utilized to characterize the stepwise modification of the antigen-modified electrodes. Figure 1e shows the SWV in ferro/ferricyanide redox solution for the bare DEP carbon array electrodes before and after each modification step. A well-defined sharp SWV cathodic peak for the reduction of the redox molecules was observed at the bare carbon electrode. Upon the AuNPs deposition on the working electrode surface via the electroreduction of gold salt, the peak current significantly increased. This is due to the increase in the surface area and electron transfer rate of the AuNPsmodified electrodes compared with the carbon. The reduction peak current was then increased after the cysteamine assembly on the AuNP/ DEP array electrodes. This can be attributed to the electrostatic attraction of the redox anions to the positive amine terminals of the cysteamine which led to the elevation of the current. Then, after the activation with gluteraldehyde and MERS-CoV antigen immobilization, the current was decreased. This decrease in the peak current is due to the barriers created on the electrode surface because of the bulky protein which retards the redox molecules to reach surface. This implies the successful covalent attachment of the antigen by reaction of the amino groups of the protein with the terminal aldehyde groups on the electrode surface forming imide bond.

            "text": "At the optimum conditions (10 \u03bcg.mL \u22121 of the fixed antibody concentration and 20 min incubation time) we have performed the experiments to study the detection range of the MERS-CoV and HCoV antigens. In each sample, a certain concentration of each antigen is mixed with 10 \u03bcg.mL \u22121 of its specific antibody and incubated immediately on the corresponding electrode on the array chip. After washing, the electrodes were measured using SWV in ferro/ferricyanide redox couple. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the SWV peak decreases after the incubation with the mixture due to the binding affinity of the antibody to the antigen immobilized on the surface causing a blocking effect because of the bulky antibody that retards the electron transfer and thus deceases the current as explained above. Figure 3c and d show the sensor responses after incubation with different concentrations of proteins from 0.001 to 10,000 ng.mL \u22121 . The calibration plots give good linear relationship between the sensor response and the concentrations from 0.001 to 100 ng.mL \u22121 and 0.01 to 10,000 ng.mL This indicates high sensitivity of the multiplexed immunosensor for MERS-CoVand HCoV which we attribute it to the highly conductivity of the AuNPs-modified electrodes which leads to an increase of the electrode surface area and electron transfer efficiency, successful covalent immobilization of antigens on the surface as well as the high sensitivity of the SWV technique. Compared with the reported ELISA for MERS CoV [2] , our detection limit is lower than the ELISA (1 ng.mL) indicating the good sensitivity of our sensor. The limit of quantification of the reported isothermal amplification platform for MERS strands (20 nt) was 10 \u00d7 10 \u221212 M, 6 \u00d7 109 copies per device which was comparable with the RT-PCR method. Our electrochemical sensor is also user- friendly and less costly than quantitative real-time RT-PCR which makes it more suitable in areas where resources and expertise could be limited. The array immunosensor accuracy was also tested by performing triplicate experiments for each antigen. The relative standard deviations of the results ranged from 3.0-6% implying very good reproducibility of the immunosensor.",

The array immunosensor was therefore incubated with FluA and FluB proteins, and then the sensor response was measured after washing with PBS buffer. As shown in Fig. 4a and b the immunosensor responses for MERS-CoV and HCoV proteins was remarkably lower than the non-specific proteins that is attributed to the selectivity of the sensor towards their respective proteins. The high signals for the non-specific proteins indicated that no competition was taking place and therefore, maximum number of antibody molecules binds to the surface. However, in the case of the specific proteins, a competition takes place leading to less amount of antibody available for binding with the antigen immobilised on the surface. We have also tested a control electrode on which BSA protein was immobilised on the surface instead of the specific antigens. No significant responses were obtained for the control electrodes indicating that there is no non-specific adsorption on the sensors. These results indicate appropriate selectivity of the biosensor. Moreover, the simultaneous detection of the two proteins (MERS-CoV and HCoV) was also confirmed by mixing the two proteins and incubation on the entire sensor surface. In this case, signals were obtained for both MERS-CoV and HCoV electrodes indicating the possible applicability of the sensor for simultaneous detection of multiple types of CoV. The relative standard deviations of the measurements on different sensors were around 5% indicating the good repeatability of the sensors. The sensors were also stable for around 2 weeks with only around 2% change in the current indicating good stability of the assay.",

The detection relied on the indirect competition between the free virus in the sample and immobilized MERS-CoV protein for fixed concentration of added antibody to the sample. The sensor response was detected by monitoring the change in the peak current of the SWV signal upon adding different concentrations of the MERS-CoV antigen. This immunosensor showed low detection limit, high degree of selectivity against other non-specific proteins (Flu A and Flu B) and acceptable stability. The sensitivity of MERS-CoV immunosensor is attributed to the utilization of AuNP modified carbon array electrodes which lead to increased electron transfer efficiency and electrode surface area. Furthermore, the use of disposable DEP array electrode reduces the cost of the assay and enabled the multiplexed detection of MERS-CoV and HCoV simultaneously. Finally, the competitive immunosensor was successfully used to detect MERS-CoV and HCoV proteins in spiked nasal samples showing good recovery percentages. Collection of patient samples and healthy samples will be done in the future for further testing of the sensor and the results will be compared with the standard methods used currently in the hospitals such as RT PCR.",
