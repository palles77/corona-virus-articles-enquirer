The role of P2Y 2 R upregulation in vivo is poorly understood, in part due to the lack of a P2Y 2 R overexpressing animal model. The P2Y 2 R overexpressing transgenic rat was generated using a lentiviral vector. Rats overexpressing P2Y 2 R showed a significant increase in P2Y 2 R mRNA levels in all tissues screened as compared to nontransgenic rats. Fura 2 imaging of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) isolated from aorta indicated that the percentage of cells exhibiting increases in the intracellular free calcium concentration in response to P2Y 2 R agonists was significantly greater in freshly isolated SMCs from transgenic rats than wild-type controls. Histopathological examination of tissues revealed that P2Y 2 R overexpressing rats develop lymphocytic infiltration in lacrimal glands and kidneys as early as at 3 months of age. These rats show similarities to patients with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome who display lymphocyte-mediated tissue damage. This transgenic rat model of P2Y 2 R overexpression may prove useful for linking P2Y 2 R upregulation with chronic inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome.",

            "text": "Extracellular nucleotides bind to cell surface receptors known as P2 receptors that are present in most tissues [1] . These receptors have been classified into two main families: the P2X receptors that are ligand-gated ion channels comprised of homo-or heterodimers [2] , and P2Y receptors that are seven membrane spanning receptors coupled via G proteins to phospholipase C and/or adenylate cyclase [3] . The G protein-coupled P2Y 2 receptor (P2Y 2 R) is equipotently activated by ATP or UTP and is believed to be involved in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of target cells [3] . Activation of the P2Y 2 R causes proliferation and/or migration of human epidermal keratinocytes, lung epithelial tumor cells, glioma cells, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), endothelial cells, and primary rat astrocytes [reviewed in 4] . P2Y 2 R activation also increases neuronal differentiation and growth and inhibits apoptosis in neurons [5, 6] . In addition, the P2Y 2 R interacts with integrins and growth factor receptors to activate multiple signaling pathways and regulate reactive astrogliosis associated with neurodegenerative diseases [7] . P2Y 2 R activation induces \u03b1-secretase-dependent cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to release the nonamyloidogenic peptide, sAPP\u03b1, suggesting a neuroprotective role for the P2Y 2 R [8] . Furthermore, activation of the P2Y 2 R increases hepatocyte resistance to hypoxia [9] . Chen et al. [10] reported the involvement of the P2Y 2 R in neutrophil chemotaxis in which activation of the P2Y 2 R by ATP enables signal amplification and controls gradient sensing and migration of neutrophils.",

P2Y 2 R activation accelerates the rate of corneal epithelial healing [12] and plays a role in the wound healing process in rat epidermis [13] . P2Y 2 R mRNA levels and/or activity increase in models of salivary gland stress or disease [14, 15] and in blood vessels after balloon angioplasty [16] or stress induced by insertion of a vascular collar [17] . Upregulation and activation of P2Y 2 Rs in endothelium induces development of intimal hyperplasia associated with atherosclerosis and restenosis [17] , although activation of endothelial cell P2Y 2 Rs expressed at endogenous levels promotes vasodilatation [18] [19] [20] . In addition, P2Y 2 R activation inhibits bone formation by osteoblasts [21] consistent with the 9-17% increase in bone mineral content of P2Y 2 R knockout mice as compared to wild-type (WT) mice [22] . Studies also have indicated that extracellular nucleotides induce P2Y 2 R-mediated secretion of interleukin-6 by airway epithelia [23] . The P2Y 2 R knockout mouse exhibits significantly lower levels of IL-6, suggesting a protective role for the P2Y 2 R against lung infections [24] . P2Y 2 R polymorphism also has been linked to cystic fibrosis and P2Y 2 R activation mediates an increase in Cl \u2212 secretion and inhibition of Na + absorption in airway epithelial cells [25] that is virtually absent in the trachea of P2Y 2 R knockout mice [26] .",

Although mice have been used extensively in many areas of biomedical research, Tg rats have certain advantages over mice due to their larger size, unique genetics, and well-studied behavioral characteristics [27] . Rats are also better suited for microsurgery, cell and tissue transplantation, in vivo functional analyses and studies that require multiple sampling [28] . Recently, germ line transmission and ubiquitous expression of a transgene has been demonstrated in Tg rats created using a lentiviral vector [29, 30] . It has been reported that lentiviral vector injection into the perivitelline space of zygotes yields a much higher Tg rate compared to the conventional means of injecting plasmid DNA constructs into the pronucleus of a zygote [31] .",

The product of this reaction was amplified using a forward primer (5\u2032-GTATTCGGATCCTGCGAGTGAAGAACTGGAACGGA-3\u2032) that anneals 97 bp upstream of the translation start site and a reverse primer (5\u2032-ATGCAGAATTCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3\u2032) that anneals to the poly-A tail. The forward primer contains a BamHI site (underlined sequence) and the reverse primer contains an EcoRI site (underlined sequence) to generate flanking regions for ligation. Amplified P2Y 2 R cDNA was ligated into the pLV-EGFP vector (obtained from Dr. C. Lois, MIT, Cambridge, Mass., USA) where the P2Y 2 R cDNA replaced the enhanced green fluorescence protein sequence [29] . The new vector, designated as pLV-P2Y 2 R, was sequenced to confirm the validity of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and ligation. The expression of the P2Y 2 R in pLV-P2Y 2 R-infected cells was driven by the ubiquitin-C (UB) promoter that drives expression of ubiquitous transgenes [32] . The pLV-P2Y 2 R is composed of the woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WRE) and an HIVflap element at the 5\u2032-LTR ( fig. 1 ). Lentivirus was generated by cotransfection of pLV-P2Y 2 R, p\u03948.9 (composed of structural genes for virion assembly) and pVSV-G (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) into a 293FT packaging cell (Invitrogen). Culture medium was collected at 48 h after transfection for 3 consecutive days at 24-hour intervals. The supernatant was centrifuged at 25,000 g for 90 min. The viral vector pellet was resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution, aliquoted, titered and kept frozen at \u221280\u00b0C. Direct measurements of the titer of pLV-P2Y 2 R were not possible due to the lack of an anti-P2Y 2 R-specific antibody. Therefore, the titer of pLV-P2Y 2 R was estimated to be in the range of 1 \u00d7 10 8 to 1 \u00d7 10 9 CFU/ml based on a similar study using the same transfection conditions with a lentiviral vector expressing the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) [31] .",

Morphologically normal embryos having both male and female pronuclei and sperm tail were used for lentiviral vector injection. For microinjection, a sharp, pointed pipette was transferred into a BL-II hood for vector loading. The vector was then loaded into the injection pipette using a microloader.

P2Y 2 R mRNA levels remained elevated in all Tg tissue specimens examined ( fig. 2c, d) , consistent with results obtained with third generation Tg rats ( fig. 2b) . These results showed that sixth generation P2Y 2 R overexpressing Tg rats (n = 3) had 106-, 74-, 55-, 1.9-, 2.3-and 25-fold higher P2Y 2 R mRNA expression in brain, kidney, lacrimal gland, liver, lung and salivary gland, respectively, as compared to tissues from WT control rats. P2Y 2 R mRNA expression in brain and salivary and lacrimal glands was not detectable in WT animals ( fig. 2c, d) . Since P2Y 2 R mRNA levels in brain and salivary and lacrimal glands could not be determined in WT animals, expression levels of P2Y 2 R mRNA in these tissues were assumed to be 50% of the levels in WT kidney for the purpose of quantitative comparisons with tissues from P2Y 2 R overexpressing rats. P2Y 2 R mRNA levels were also found to be significantly higher in Tg rat aortic SMCs as compared to WT rat aortic SMCs ( fig. 3a) .",

Unfortunately, there are few Tg rat lines available as compared to thousands of Tg mouse lines. To date, the pronuclear injection (PI) method has been used to generate the majority of Tg rats.

            "text": "A relatively new and efficient means of gene transfer (i.e., using a lentiviral vector) enabled us to produce a Tg rat line overexpressing the P2Y 2 R. Oncoretroviral vectors are considered to be a most efficient gene delivery system but are not without their problems, including size limitation (10 kb), multiple integration sites per genome, and difficulties with maintaining transgene expression over subsequent generations [41, 42] . However, recent studies showed that, unlike traditional oncoretroviral vectors, transgenes introduced by lentiviral vectors into oocytes, male germ-line cells, embryos, and embryonic stem cells remain stably expressed [29, 43, 44] . Furthermore, since the lentiviral vector is simply deposited into the perivitelline space of a zygote, there is no need for visualization of the pronuclei, making Tg animal production much easier and less detrimental. Lentiviral vector injection into the perivitelline space yields a much higher Tg rate as compared to the highly inefficient pronuclear microinjection of plasmids in the rat. To generate an average of 4-6 Tg founder rats with PI, for example, it is necessary to inject 500-600 zygotes if the background strain is outbred (such as for SD rats) and to prepare about 20 recipient females for embryo transfer. In addition to the large numbers of microinjections and embryo transfers with the PI method, it is also necessary to genotype and maintain a large number of pups to identify Tg rats. These shortcomings are magnified if one wishes to create a Tg rat on an inbred background, such as Fischer 344, Lewis, Brown Norway or Wistar-Furth, due to their poor response to superovulation and higher sensitivity to microinjection [27, 45] . This study demonstrates that injection of only 22 SD zygotes obtained from one female donor and transferred to one recipient was sufficient to create one founder that was germline Tg, and transgene expression was maintained through at least 6 generations. Therefore, this result highlights the effectiveness of generating Tg rats using lentiviral vectors.",

            "text": "Although the P2Y 2 R has been studied in a wide variety of cell and tissue types, Tg animal models overexpressing the P2Y 2 R were not available before this study. Here, a Tg rat model overexpressing the P2Y 2 R was developed that expresses increased levels of P2Y 2 R mRNA in major organs and tissues, such as aorta, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lacrimal gland and leg muscle. Comparison of WT and P2Y 2 R overexpressing Tg rats showed that expression levels of the P2Y 2 R transgene in tissues did not change between the third and sixth generations. The endogenous P2Y 2 R in WT rats is expressed in liver, lung and muscle and to a lesser extent in heart, kidney, and brain, but was undetectable in lacrimal and salivary glands. Expression of the P2Y 2 R transgene in lacrimal and salivary glands was elevated as compared to WT rats, but was lower than in the other tissues analyzed. Although oncoretroviral vectors have been considered as efficient gene delivery systems, previous studies showed their limitation with regard to transgene transcriptional silencing in subsequent generations [41] . In this study, we demonstrated that incorporation of the P2Y 2 R transgene into a lentiviral vector enabled stable P2Y 2 R mRNA expression through 6 generations and the expressed P2Y 2 R was functionally active, as indicated by increased P2Y 2 R agonist-induced intracellular calcium mobilization in single SMCs from P2Y 2 R overexpressing Tg versus WT rats. In addition, there was a significant increase in the percentage of responsive aortic SMCs of P2Y 2 R overexpressing Tg versus WT rats. Overall, these results indicate that functional P2Y 2 R expression is significantly higher in Tg rat tissue as compared to WT controls. In the cardiovascular system, it has been shown that extracellular UTP or ATP induces mitogenic activation of SMCs through activation of P2Y 2 Rs. P2Y 2 R mRNA is upregulated in intimal lesions of rat aorta and contributes to the development of intimal hyperplasia [17] .",

Masaki and Sugai [46] reported that 45% of patients with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome develop symptoms only in exocrine glands, whereas 50% of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patients exhibit lymphocyte-mediated tissue damage that may involve the pulmonary, renal, hepatic, hematologic, and/or dermatologic systems. There are several case reports linking Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and renal pathology [47, 48] that resembles the renal histopathology of P2Y 2 R overexpressing Tg rats ( fig. 4, 5) . The glomerulonephropathy observed was associated with basement membrane thickening and collagen deposition, but not amyloid deposition, as determined by PSR, PAM and Congo red staining, respectively. While both harderian gland alteration and chronic progressive nephropathy are known to occur spontaneously in laboratory rats [49] , it is notable that all P2Y 2 R overexpressing Tg rats exhibited lesions of the lacrimal gland or kidneys regardless of age, whereas no lesions were apparent in lacrimal glands or kidneys of WT rats. Additionally, the severity of lesions, especially involving glomeruli, in 3-month-old P2Y 2 R overexpressing Tg rat is incongruent with spontaneous chronic progressive nephropathy. Since the P2Y 2 R overexpressing Tg rats are maintained in facilities free of major rat pathogens, as determined by sentinel monitoring, it is unlikely that the lesions in P2Y 2 R overexpressing Tg rats are attributable to infectious disease. Pathological lesions observed in P2Y 2 R overexpressing animals worsened with age except in the case of the 3-month-old rat which displayed severe lesions in kidney and lacrimal gland. We did not determine P2Y 2 R expression levels in animals that were used for histopathological examination. It is possible that the 3-month-old rat expressed higher P2Y 2 R levels as compared to other rats used for histopathological examination, since this rat was an offspring of two P2Y 2 R Tg parents and may have been homozygous. The other rats used in histopathological examination were confirmed to be heterozygous. Also, since SD rats are outbred, greater individual variations are expected.",
