Exosomes, 30-100-nm intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (MVB) released upon exocytic fusion of the MVB with the plasma membrane, are increasingly recognized as a novel mode of cell-independent communication. Exosomes have been shown to function in antigen presentation and tumor metastasis, and in transmitting infectious agents. However, little is known about the biogenesis and function of exosomes in polarized cells. In this review, we discuss new evidence suggesting that exosomes participate in the transport of morphogens and RNA, and thus influence cell polarity and developmental patterning of tissues.",

            "text": "Eukaryotic cells have evolved elaborate endosomal networks to enable them to communicate with one another, to differentiate into tissues and to adapt to diverse environments [1] . Endosomes are membrane-bound organelles that transport newly synthesized material from the Golgi complex, and endocytosed material from the plasma membrane to various intracellular destinations ( Figure 1 ). Depending on their morphology, their distinct protein and lipid composition, their position within the cell and the cargo that they carry, endosomes are classified as early, late or recycling [1, 2] . Within the cell, endosomes are characterized by modular organization, spatial connectivity and functional cooperation, which together helps them to form intricate interconnected networks. In polarized cells, such as epithelial cells and neurons, endosomal networks are even more complex, because these cells interact with different extracellular environments at their apical (axonal) and basolateral (somatodendritic) surfaces (Figure 1b) . Endosomes are strategically located at the crossroads between the biosynthetic and endocytic routes in the cell, which enables them to direct both newly synthesized and endocytosed proteins to the appropriate membrane domains or intracellular destinations. Proteins are sorted via their incorporation into different subpopulations of carrier vesicles, a process mediated by sorting signals (e.g. tyrosine and dileucine motifs, glycophosphatidylinositol [GPI] anchors and N-glycans, etc) and signal-decoding machinery (e.g. clathrin adaptors and lipid rafts) [3] . These carrier vesicles are transported to, dock at and fuse with their target plasma membrane domains by the coordinated function of the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons, SNAREs (soluble Nethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors), Rabs and other small GTPases and tethering factors, such as the exocyst. Rab GTPases are a family of more than 60 ubiquitously expressed proteins that are indispensable for coordinating various steps of intracellular trafficking, such as vesicle formation, transport and fusion with the target membrane [4] . Within the cell, different Rabs are restricted to specific membrane domains ( Figure 1 ) and help to establish organelle identity. In the endocytic route, internalized proteins and lipids are first incorporated into early endosomes, major sorting platforms where selective remodeling of the lipid bilayer segregates recycling molecules from cargo targeted for degradation [5, 6] . Endocytic cargo fated to be degraded is preferentially sorted into 40-100-nm vesicles that bud into the lumen of early endosomes, a process topologically equivalent to outward budding at the plasma membrane [7] . The best-characterized signal to enable sorting into these intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) is ubiquitylation, the covalent addition of ubiquitin subunits to cytoplasmic lysine residues of proteins. Tubular elements of early endosomes undergo fission and subsequent fusion with recycling endosomes, whereas the portion of early endosomes containing ILVs matures or detaches to form multivesicular bodies (MVBs;Box 1). Maturation of early endosomes occurs with the replacement of Rab5 with Rab7, and the accumulation of ILVs containing phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), ubiquitylated cargo (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] ) and other proteins commonly found in ILVs (e.g. tetraspanins) [8] . Upon fusion of the limiting membrane of the MVB with lysosomes ( Figure 1 ), ubiquitylated proteins in ILVs become vulnerable to degradation.",

            "text": "Accumulating evidence suggests that some components of the molecular machinery involved in sorting proteins towards the degradative pathway drive membrane invagination in early endosomes, thereby generating MVBs. Central players in this process are the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport, ESCRT-0, ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III, which are multimeric protein complexes (reviewed in [14, 15] ). ESCRT proteins were first identified through yeast genetic screens for vacuolar protein sorting (vps) mutants. vps-mutant yeast cells have an abnormal multi-cisternal compartment (called the class E compartment) in which proteins targeted to the yeast vacuole accumulate. ESCRT complexes deform the endosomal-limiting membrane by specific protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, thereby orchestrating inward budding of vesicles. ESCRT-0, ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II have ubiquitin-interacting modules that are essential for cargo recognition and sorting. Ubiquitylated cargo first binds to Hrs (hepatocyte growth factorregulated kinase substrate, a component of ESCRT-0) on flat clathrin coats on the endosomal membrane [15] . Next, ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II are recruited to the membrane, where they cluster the ubiquitylated transmembrane proteins and package them into budding ILVs [16] . ESCRT-III recruits de-ubiquitylating enzymes to remove ubiquitin from cargo proteins before their incorporation into ILVs, and it also recruits Vps4, an ATPase that catalyzes the disassembly of all ESCRTs from membranes. Another class E Vps protein, Alix (apoptosis-linked gene 2 (ALG-2)-interacting protein X), acts as a linker between different ESCRT complexes [17] and might also play a part in intralumenal vesicle generation (Box 3) [18] .",

Thus, in mammalian cells, membrane invagination can be uncoupled from sorting of ubiquitylated cargo, perhaps owing to overlapping functions of ESCRT proteins.

Many raft-associated proteins such as tetraspanins and GPI-anchored proteins are found in exosomes. Lipid rafts decrease the lateral diffusion of proteins within the plane of the membrane and could inhibit sorting of GPI-anchored proteins and other raft-associated proteins into more fluid membrane domains that undergo fast recycling to the cell surface [5, 28] . Prolonged residence on endosomal membranes increases the likelihood that GPIanchored proteins become sorted into budding ILVs. A similar mechanism of slow recycling to the cell surface could function in sorting cross-linked membrane proteins into exosomes [26, 29, 30] .",

This suggests that epithelial cells have distinct MVB with ILVs into which apical and basolateral proteins are differentially sorted (Figure 2b ). Alternatively, since apical and basolateral endocytic routes have been shown to converge at the level of late endosomes in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells [31] , exosomes headed to the apical or basolateral membranes might be generated from different intralumenal vesicle populations within a common late endosomal pool. If this is true, then there should be some mechanism of segregating the two intralumenal vesicle populations into secondary organelles that can then be transported to the appropriate membrane ( Figure 2b ).",

For example, GPI-anchors and lipid rafts, known to act as apical sorting mechanisms [3] , might drive GPI-anchored proteins and raft-associated proteins into ILVs destined for apical release. Alternatively, interactions between the ESCRT machinery and specific basolateral sorting motifs could direct proteins into ILVs destined for release at the baso-lateral membrane. An example of this is the binding of Alix to the YXX\u03a6 internalization motif of the transferrin receptor in maturing reticulocytes, a process that is necessary for sorting transferrin receptor into exosomes [19] . Degradation of the clathrin adaptor AP2 (adaptor protein 2) is necessary for exosomal sorting of transferrin receptor, suggesting that diverting cargo from endocytic recycling directs them into exosomes. Alix also binds to RME-1, the conserved EH domain-containing protein required for receptormediated endocytosis, on recycling endosomes and participates in recycling basolateral cargo, such as major histocompatability (MHC) class I molecules in the Caenor-habditis elegans intestine [32] . These data suggest that, in polarized cells, Alix plays a dual role in basolateral sorting: it cooperates with RME-1 in the recycling route and, when required, it specifically interacts with basolateral proteins to target them into exosomes. This hypothesis is borne out by biochemical and mass spectrometric analysis of apical and basolateral exosomes released by intestinal epithelial cells; apical exosomes contain GPI-anchored proteins (e.g. microsomal dipeptidase) and raft-associated proteins (e.g. syntaxin-3), whereas exosomes released basolaterally are enriched in MHC class I and II molecules [11] .",

Depletion of cell cholesterol increases endosome motility towards the microtubule plus-end by decreasing levels of endosomeassociated Rab7 and increasing association with Rab4, which is involved in fast endocytic recycling [48] . However, how cholesterol depletion affects sorting into ILVs has not been studied. Cellular stress (e.g. from exposure to \u03b3-irradiation, DNA damaging agents or heat shock) has also been shown to stimulate exosome secretion [45, 49] . DNA damage activates the tumor suppressor p53, which induces the release of exosomes, presumably as a mechanism of tumor surveillance or to affect gene expression patterns in adjacent cells [49] .",

Taken together, these data raise the possibility that syntaxin-3 is also involved in the apical release of exosomes.

Both Wingless and Hedgehog are palmitoylated, and Hedgehog is covalently attached to cholesterol, linking these morphogens to the cell membrane. It was initially reported that Wingless was found in argosomes, vesicles released at the basolateral side of the Drosophila wing imaginal disc epithelium [73] . Within cells, argosomes were detected in endocytic compartments, and argosome-containing organelles moved at speeds consistent with that of molecular motors. In the developing epithelium, the rate of argosome spread was consistent with the rate of Wingless transport. Given that Wingless is present both on the basolateral membrane and in multivesicular endosomes, the authors proposed that argosomes are generated in the same manner as exosomes -through the inward budding of endosomes -and are transported from cell to cell by the exocytic fusion of Winglesscontaining MVBs. Only certain regions of the membrane were able to generate argosomes, indicating that, as with exosomes, these vesicles have a non-random protein composition. Although the ultrastructure or size of argosomes was not examined, the fact that they could be visualized by confocal microscopy suggests that they are larger than exosomes.",

Instead, Wingless and Hedgehog co-purified and co-localized with lipophorin, the Drosophila lipoprotein, and depletion of lipophorin decreased morphogen spread in the wing disc. On the basis of these data, argosomes are now proposed to be lipoprotein particles that associate reversibly with extracellular lipid-linked morphogens and promote their long-range movement. Morphogen transport from cell to cell by lipoproteins is thought to occur passively by successive steps of extraction and re-insertion at the plasma membrane, but the involvement of specific lipoprotein receptors in this process has not been definitively demonstrated [75] .",

Fusion of MVBs with the apical plasma membrane, and the subsequent release of ILVs required the V0 subunit of the vacuolar ATPase. Fusion events between MVBs and the plasma membrane were blocked in V0 mutants, leading to enlarged, dense MVBs in which Hedgehog-related peptides accumulated. Previous studies have shown that the V0 sector is necessary for homotypic fusion of the vacuole in yeast and for fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane in Drosophila [78] ; in both these cases, the role of the V0 subunit in fusion was independent of its role in proton translocation. In contrast, vacuole fission in yeast was recently shown to be dependent on the proton pump activity of the V-ATPase [79] . In vacuole fusion, V0 sectors from opposing membranes come together after trans-SNARE pairing, thereby creating a proteolipid channel that spans both membranes, and fusion is triggered upon calcium release from the vacuolar lumen [80] . It is thus likely that the V0 sector functions in the formation and/or stabilization of the fusion pore during exocytic fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane.",

Amazingly, incubation of human cells with exosomes from mouse cells induced the production of mouse proteins from mRNAs that were present in exosomes. However, mRNA from mast cell exosomes was transferred to other mast cells but not to CD4+ T-cells, the only other cell type tested. Thus, exosome-mediated horizontal gene transfer is specific, in terms of both the RNAs packaged into exosomes and the cells to which these RNAs are transferred. Transfer of regulatory RNAs between cells by exosomes is a potentially powerful tool for orchestrating gene expression during development. Among the miRNAs found in exosomes were lin-4 and let-7, both of which have known functions in developmental timing, and other miRNAs involved in diverse processes such as angiogenesis and exocytosis [37] .",

            "text": "Exosomes were initially thought to be little more than garbage bags containing proteins and lipids that the cell needed to get rid of. It is now being realized that exosomes are powerful intercellular messengers that can be harnessed for therapeutic purposes. One can imagine exosomes to be itinerant workers who travel away from the source of production and roam from cell to cell to disseminate important information. In recent years, various modes of intercellular communication have been discovered, including cytonemes [12] and argosomes [73] , which participate in tissue development. Work summarized in this review points to an exciting role for exosomes in the establishment of cell and tissue polarity. However, this is still an emerging field, and many questions remain unanswered. Are exosomes involved in the establishment of apicobasal polarity or in initiating the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition? Do apical and basolateral exosomes originate from distinct MVB populations and, as suggested in this review, do exosomal sorting and MVB exocytosis mechanisms parallel those operating in the biosynthetic and/or endocytic routes in epithelial cells? What is the molecular machinery involved in apical and basolateral exosome release? To date, only the V0 subunit of the vacuolar ATPase has been implicated in the apical secretion of exosomes [77] . Are other molecules such as Rab11 and syntaxin-3 also involved? Is the V0 sector also involved in basolateral exosome release? The issue of exosomes in morphogen and RNA transport and in influencing cell fate decisions during development raises even more questions. What determines the cells with which exosomes interact? How does cell-tocell transport of exosomes occur in developing epithelia and how far do they travel? Do exosomes undergo sequential rounds of endocytosis and secretion (akin to planar transcytosis) or, once internalized, are they lost forever? Answers to these questions will provide a better understanding of these enigmatic vesicles and their roles in cell and tissue morphogenesis.",

However, given that all endosomes along the degradative route are multivesicular [85] , the converse is also true; late endosomes can be thought of as a type of MVB [8] . To further complicate matters, some mammalian cells have a spherical transport intermediate (~400-500 nm in diameter) that contains ILVs and is distinct from both early and late endosomes. This intermediate, called the endosomal carrier vesicle or multivesicular body, has been shown to fuse with late endosomes [10, 89, 90] . Because multivesicular bodies that conform to these criteria are not seen in all cell types [91] and given that MVBs from cells such as reticulocytes contain Rab4 and Rab5 [92] , which are normally found on early endosomes, there might be cell-specific differences in the generation and usage of transport intermediates between early and late endosomes. To avoid confusion, in this review, we consider late endosomes to be a type of MVB and refer to the trafficking route from early to late endosomes as the MVB pathway.",

Given that several cell types shed vesicles of various sizes and compositions, a few caveats for using the term 'exosomes' have been established [95, 96] : vesicles classified as exosomes should b\u1ebd 30-100 nm in diameter; they should originate as intralumenal vesicles of the MVB pathway released by fusion of the limiting membrane of the MVB with the plasma membrane (as opposed to vesicles shed directly from the cell surface [99] ); and, irrespective of the cell type of origin, they should harbor certain proteins and lipids in common (see below).",

            "text": "Intralumenal vesicles are formed when the endosomal membrane bends with a negative curvature away from the cytoplasm (topologically equivalent to outward budding at the plasma membrane), as opposed to the positive curvature of vesicles budding into the cytoplasm during endocytosis. A common theme emerging from studies on ILV biogenesis is that cargo and ultimate fate dictate the mechanisms used to generate negative curvature which involves a fascinating interplay between the intrinsic geometries of proteins and lipids. Ubiquitin, ESCRT proteins and cargo such as EGFR drive the formation of ILVs enriched in Ptd(Ins)3P which head to lysosomes [9] . Until recently, evidence for a direct involvement of ESCRT proteins in ILV biogenesis was lacking. New data point to a role for two isoforms of the ESCRT-III protein CHMP4 (charged multivesicular body protein 4, the human ortholog of yeast snf7 (sucrose nonfermenting 7)) in generating negative membrane curvature. When overexpressed in cells, snf7 assembles into filamentous polymers at the membrane which are arranged into rings and induce the formation of buds and tubules that protrude outward [111] . The late endosomal anionic lipid lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) is a cone-shaped lipid that can generate spontaneous negative curvature as a result of surface area difference between the outer and inner leaflets of the bilayer. LBPA has been shown to induce inward budding in liposomes and Alix (apoptosis-linked gene 2 (ALG-2)-interacting protein X), the mammalian orthologue of yeast Bro1, regulates the fission-fusion balance in LBPAcontaining liposomes [112] . The Bro1 domain of Alix is shaped like a boomerang with a convex face composed of basic residues that can bind negatively charged membranes and act as a sensor of negative curvature [18, 113, 114] . Viruses and bacterial toxins that need to escape from MVBs into the cytosol by back-fusion are sorted into LBPA-rich ILVs, a process that is regulated by Alix [10] . Intriguing new work shows that ceramide, another coneshaped lipid generated by hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by sphingomyelinases, is essential for forming ILVs that are eventually released as exosomes by an oligodendrocyte cell line [22] . Sorting of the raft-associated myelin proteolipid protein into exosomes required the activity of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 but not Alix or ESCRT proteins Hrs, Tsg101 and Vps4. Alix, however, is responsible for sorting transferrin receptor into exosomes in reticulocytes [19] , suggesting that there may be cell type-and cargo-specific differences in the requirement for class E Vps proteins. The data on LBPA and ceramide show that endogenously produced cone-shaped lipids can induce the formation of different populations of ILVs, one destined for cytosolic release and the other for release into the extracellular space as exosomes. This is supported by the observation that exosomes are LBPA-poor but rich in ceramide [22, 102] . Different mechanisms of generating different ILV populations suggest a hitherto under-appreciated complexity of the MVB pathway; however many outstanding questions remain regarding how ceramide-induced budding is regulated, how various ILV populations are sorted to their final destinations and what the potential implications are for polarized cells. The endosomal network and the multivesicular bodies (MVBs) pathway. Non-polarized cells (a) have a simpler endosomal system than polarized cells (b). (a) Newly synthesized proteins are transported from the trans-Golgi (TGN) network to the plasma membrane (green and blue arrows). Clustering of proteins into lipid rafts (blue) or interaction of specific motifs in the proteins with clathrin adaptors (green) act as sorting signals. Recycling of endocytosed membrane proteins occurs from early endosomes [also known as sorting endosomes, (EE/SE)] and recycling endosomes (RE, orange arrows). Proteins destined for degradation are sorted into membrane invaginations of the EE/SE. These intralumenal vesicle-containing regions of the EE/SE eventually mature into late endosomes, also known as multivesicular bodies (LE/MVBs). Ubiquitylation of proteins and the ESCRT machinery helps to sort cargo into LE/MVBs and might also participate in their biogenesis [15, 85] . Not all ILVs are destined for lysosomal degradation. Fusion of ILVs with the late endosomal limiting membrane, a process called 'back-fusion', is essential for the cytoplasmic delivery of certain proteins and viruses [10] . In many cells, the limiting membrane of LE/MVBs fuses with the plasma membrane, releasing ILVs into the extracellular space; these vesicles are now referred to as exosomes. (b). Epithelial cells have distinct apical and basolateral membrane domains separated by tight junctions (brown), and a complex endosomal system that is essential for the establishment and maintenance of polarity [1] . In the biosynthetic route, at the TGN, specific signals help to sort proteins into carrier vesicles that are transported to either the apical or the basolateral membrane. GPI-anchors or association with lipid rafts transport proteins to the apical domain (blue) and proteins containing motifs such as NPXY, YXX\u03a6, LL and L which interact with clathrin adaptors are transported to the basolateral domain (green) [3] . In the endocytic route, apical and basolateral proteins are first internalized into early apical or basolateral endosomes [also known as sorting endosomes, (EAE/ASE and EBE/BSE)]. Recycling cargo is transported to common recycling endosomes (CREs) and sorted into separate apical and basolateral recycling routes. In epithelial cells, the apical recycling route also includes the Rab11+ apical Sorting and trafficking of exosomes. (a) In non-polarized cells, GPI-anchoring, lipid raftassociation or antibody-induced oligomerization sorts proteins into the exosomal pathway [26, 27] . Degradation of the clathrin adaptor AP2 reroutes the transferrin receptor away from recycling (orange) and towards the MVB pathway (red) [19] . This is dependent upon binding of the YXX\u03a6 motif of the transferrin receptor to the class E protein Alix. Many studies have shown that increasing intracellular calcium [25, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] , decreasing membrane cholesterol [36, 45, 46] or inducing cellular stress [45, 49] stimulates the release of exosomes. Once released, exosomes interact with cells by binding to specific receptors such as Tim-4 [57] , an endogenous phosphatidylserine receptor [58] , or other cell surface molecules [56] , or by directly fusing with target cells [55] . (b) Epithelial cells release exosomes at both the apical (intestine, kidney) and basolateral (intestine) surfaces [11, 23, 61] . Exosomes released apically by intestinal epithelial cells have a different composition than those released basolaterally [11] , raising the possibility of differential sorting into apical and basolateral exosomes. However, how this might occur is still largely speculative. Here, we depict two potential sorting mechanisms (red dashed arrows) that might function in polarized exosomal sorting; on the basis of mechanisms operating in non-polarized cells, we hypothesize that GPI-anchoring and association with lipid rafts (which are both apical targeting signals in the biosynthetic route in polarized cells [3] ) direct proteins into MVBs destined for fusion with the apical membrane. Sorting into MVBs destined for basolateral release might use interactions between the ESCRT machinery and canonical basolateral sorting signals. In a manner analogous to that seen in non-polarized cells, binding of Alix to the YXX\u03a6 motif of the transferrin receptor might direct it into exosomes destined for basolateral release. It is currently unknown whether apical and basolateral exosomes arise from two separate LE/ MVBs or from a common LE/MVB pool [31] . The V0 subunit of the vacuolar ATPase has been implicated in the apical secretion of exosomes [77] ; it remains to be investigated if Rab11, which is involved in exosome release in non-polarized cells [50] , and syntaxin-3, which is involved in secretory granule exocytosis [52] , also function in apical release of exosomes. Potential role of exosomes in cell and tissue polarity. Exosomes released at either the apical or basolateral surfaces of epithelial cells can travel over several cell diameters [74] . Exosomes internalized by dendritic cells traffic through LAMP-1-positive late endsosomes or lysosomes [56] ; whether this is true in epithelial cells is currently unknown. Studies have shown that exosomes carry morphogens, mRNA and miRNA, molecules that play important roles in cell and tissue morphogenesis [37, 71, 77] . Mechanisms involved in sorting morphogens and nucleic acids into exosomes have yet to be elucidated but might involve association with lipid rafts [76] or binding to proteins involved in endosomal sorting [84] . Upon internalization by target cells, exogenous mRNA delivered by exosomes is translated into protein [37] , endogenous protein synthesis can be downregulated by exosomal miRNA, and morphogens can influence gene expression. Thus, by modulating the protein repertoire of target cells, it is likely that exosomes could participate in the generation of apicobasal polarity in epithelial cells, planar cell polarity of the epithelial sheet, or the developmental patterning of tissues such as the Drosophila wing and the vertebrate neural tube. Given that tumor-derived exosomes promote tumor invasion, exosomes might also contribute to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, a direct role for exosomes in any of these processes remains to be demonstrated.",
