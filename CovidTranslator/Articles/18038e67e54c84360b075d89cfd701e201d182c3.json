Attention must also be paid to impact on health.

On the other hand, the latter particles are brought about by human activities. Although occupying only 16% of the total emitted particles, their size is mostly of submicron order and because they contain hazardous chemical components such as nitrates, sulfates, hydrocarbons, heavy metals, etc. in high concentration, their effects on the ecosystem are serious. Fig. 7 .2.1 shows an overview of the size and concentration ranges of various aerosol particles. As it can be seen, the number concentration of atmospheric aerosol which we inhale every day ranges from several thousand particles per cm 3 in clean area to several hundred thousands in dusty areas, and the size range lies between 10 nm and several tens of micrometer. Fig. 7 .2.2 shows mass-based size distribution of atmospheric aerosol particles. Since the size distribution in the nanosize range appears only when the sources of particle generation exist, the size distribution is usually bimodal with peaks in the size range of a few to 10 micron and submicron. The former peak consists of naturally generated coarse particles such as soil dust, sea salt spray, and so on. On the contrary, the latter contains plenty of artificially generated particles, some of which grow from molecules (in most cases vapor state) exhausted by human activities through chemical reaction, condensation, and coagulation. Particle growth rarely leads to particles larger than 1 m unless high concentration of vapors or particulate matters which cause the above-mentioned growth mechanisms exist in the atmosphere.",

Examples of the former are oxides of aluminum, silicon and other substances, and typical examples of the latter are substances such as humic acid and fulvic acid. While the structure and molecular weight of particles vary depending on the area of water, it is known that what are usually present in water are comparatively small colloids (particles smaller than 500 nm). The number concentration of colloid particles in ground water, or a typical water area environment, ranges from 10 11 to 10 20 (number / m 3 ) and varies significantly depending on the geochemical conditions of the aquifer. It is known that in moving water, colloid particles sometimes act as a medium in conjunction with water and in some cases move faster than water. homogeneous porous layer such as a sand layer, and most of the colloid particles are trapped. The mechanism of partical trap in this layer is explained by the sand filtration theory. C and D are a gravel layer and a rock bed, respectively, and both have high water permeability with large gaps and cracks. Particles can also pass through easily. Safety and movement characteristics of colloid particles have a significant influence on the movement of materials such as ionized molecules in aquatic environments. Since fine particles such as nanoparticles in particular are highly stable as colloid particles, it will be very important in the future to understand their influence. At the same time, these characteristics are considered to have a high potential to be developed for further application of nanoparticles.",

Lighter fuels have a lower rate of particulate emission, but have a higher fine particle content including nanoparticles. Fig. 7 .2.5 [1] shows the frequency distribution in combustion of coal and heavy oil. Fig. 7 .2.5a and b are the distributions on a number and mass basis, respectively. As these figures clearly show, the total weight of particles of a size of 1 m or smaller is extremely low, while their total number is, on the contrary, very large. It is clear that, while the total quantity of particulate material is far larger in coal combustion than in oil combustion, the difference is less when it comes to particles 1 m or less in diameter, including nanoparticles. Most of the particles contained in pulverized coal combustion exhaust gases are considered to be formed as particulate materials directly from ash content, which is originally contained in coal and also includes some unburned carbon. Particularly, almost all large-size particles are considered to be this type of particle. On the other hand, fine particles include two types. One type is formed in the process by which low boiling point metal contained in coal ash is evaporated and vaporized in a high-temperature combustion field and then becomes particles in the exhaust gas cooling process. The other includes carbon particles formed in the gas phase, or so-called soot, which is generated due to the delay in oxygen supply for combustion of evaporated volatile matter in the initial stage. Fig. 7 .2.6 [2] shows the relationship between the trace metal content in coal ash and the particle diameter. Aluminum with a high boiling point has a constant concentration regardless of the particle diameter. However it is obvious that in the case of metals with a lower boiling point, the smaller the particle diameter, the larger the content. With regard to particles with sizes 1 m or smaller in the nano domain, it has been clarified that the generated amount is increased rapidly by reducing combustion air supply or by weakening the oxidation atmosphere in the volatile matter combustion area, for example, when air supply from a burner is reduced in twostage combustion. This also demonstrates the significant contribution of carbon particles formed in the gas phase.",

Besides the semiconductor devices, CMP is widely applied to the magnetic head, the magnetic memory, and the imaging devices. The process is primarily used for polishing the device side of a semiconductor wafer through the mechanical downforce of slurry abrasive in combination with chemical oxidation of wafer surface. In general, colloidal silica is used as abrasive slurry to planarize the oxide wafer surface. Particles in slurry are highly charged to avoid aggregations between particles or between particles and wafer surfaces. During the process, large volumes of ultrapure water are consumed to clean the surface of the wafer, which generates large quantity of CMP wastewater typically having high solid content resulting from slurry abrasive particles of SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , or CeO 2 , depending on the nature of the CMP application. The quantity of CMP wastewater generated is expected to increase proportionally with the growing needs of the CMP processes. As a result, the treatment and reuse of CMP wastewater has become increasingly necessary. The CMP wastewater has been generally treated with the conventional chemical coagulation-sedimentation process, producing large quantity of sludge. Currently, a membrane filtration process coupled with chemical pretreatment is used to separate the nanoscale particles from the CMP wastewater to reclaim the water [1, 2] .",

Aquatic humic substances including humic and fulvic acids are a term referring to a broad class of naturally occurring mixture of organic compounds, ubiquitous in surface waters, ground waters, and soil pore waters. They are a complex mixture of heterogeneous organic materials in terms of elemental composition, chemical functionality, and molecular size distribution since humic substances can be derived from any organic materials, including plant and animal debris, microfauna, biowaste, pesticide, and others. The molecular weights of humic acids range from several thousands to several tens of thousands daltons, and those of fulvic acids range from several tens of thousands to several hundred thousands daltons. Because of this versatility, humic substances are known to significantly affect the behavior of some pollutants in natural environments, such as trace metal speciation and toxicity, solubilization and adsorption of hydrophobic organic compounds, and disinfection by-product formation [8] .",

Fig. 7 .2.9 shows an example of electrical mobility distribution for ions generated by the electrospray method (positive in this case) [7] . This method atomizes liquid fed to a tip of a capillary electrode to form fine droplets with large amounts of charge by applying high voltage between the tip and the downstream counter electrode. When water in the generated droplets evaporates and their surface charge density attains the charge limit called \"Rayleigh limit\", this phenomenon induces their self-fragmentation followed by the formation of a high concentration of cluster ions. In this figure, the high-mobility peak on the right side corresponds to the cluster ions. These ions are 2 nm in size assuming that they are singly charged. Meanwhile, another peak on the figure results from NVR in water and then its height increases with the increase in the fraction of tap water in the fed liquid. The electrical-mobility-equivalent size of NVR particles measured by differential mobility analyzer (DMA) -condensation nucleus counter (CNC) method ranges from 10 to 20 nm and their concentration is on the order of 10 4 particles/cm 3 .

The eco-friendlinessoriented standards such as Blue Angle Standard [8] regulate the maximum permissible limits of benzene, styrene, total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), ozone and particles. As the regulation of particles is based on the emitted mass per hour, mainly the relatively coarser particles such as toner and dust adhering to paper have been targeted. However, some reports have revealed that nanoparticles are emitted from inkjet printers or laser printers [9] . Fig. 7 .2.10 depicts the size distribution of particles emitted from a laser printer measured by a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). As seen in the figure, nanoparticles with a peak diameter of around 30 nm are generated in printing mode, whereas the emission in the case of feeding paper without printing is about one third of the normal printing mode. Furthermore, these particles were dried by passing them through a diffusion dryer because they are thought to originate from the nucleation of water vapor emitted from papers in the fixation process. As a result, it was found that most particles formed in the paper feed mode evaporated and then vanished, while particles in the printing mode contained nonvolatile components as well as water. From these results it is anticipated that the particles are derived from styrene remaining in the toner even though their composition has still not been identified. Meanwhile, it is thought that during ink discharge ink-jet printers emit not only the main ink droplets but also their satellites (about 1 m) to result in nanometer-sized NVRs during printing.",

However, they reported that the concentrations were very low. In addition, measurements of nanoparticle levels during final packaging of carbon black, which is a typical engineered nanoparticle material, showed that there was no increase in nearby air [11] .",

A distinction should also be drawn between nanoparticles manufactured for industrial application and those unintentionally generated and released in the environment, such as welding fumes or diesel exhaust particles (DEP). In the fields of environmental science and toxicology, numerous studies on the potential health hazards caused by ultrafine particles have been conducted. Practically, there are several definitions of nanoparticles or ultrafine particles, however, findings regarding biological effects of the ultrafine particles are useful as a starting point for estimating the effects of nanoparticles on human health. Human and animals contact with nanoparticles through various routes: nanoparticles can be inhaled in the air, swallowed in the water, ingested in food, and absorbed via the skin in cosmetics. For successful risk assessment, it is important to determine how nanomaterials or nanoparticles are used, such as composites, surface coating, or powders. Coatings or powders have the potential to release a part of their nanomaterials into the environment. Workers who come into contact with nanomaterials have the possibility of exposure to nanoparticles at the workplace. Consumers of products using nanotechnology can also be exposed to them. Attention needs to be paid to the environments and ecosystems in which nanoparticles and nanomaterials are released.

How deeply particles can penetrate and where they become deposited on each respiratory airway such as the nasal cavity, tracheobronchial tree, and the alveoli depend on their size under the various deposition mechanisms: inertial impaction, gravitational sedimentation and diffusion, etc. The respiratory airway includes the anterior nasal passage, posterior nasal passage, pharynx, larynx, trachea, main bronchi, bronchi, bronchioles, terminal bronchioles, alveolar duct, and alveoli, as shown in Fig. 7. 3.2. In the human lungs, the trachea divides asymmetrically into the right main bronchus that enters the right lung where it divides into three lobes, that is, an upper, a middle, and a lower, and the left main bronchus that enters the left lung where it divides into two lobes, that is, an upper and a lower.

In 1994, the ICRP Task Group on Lung Dynamic (ICRP: the International Commission of Radiological Protection) published their revised lung model [7] . The deposition, clearance, and translocation of particles in each of the compartments were described. While the model has been widely used in the nuclear field, it is applicable to conventional aerosols as well as radioactive aerosol. In the nuclear field, aerosols including radon progeny that used to be nanoparticles have been studied. Fig. 7.3.3 shows the deposition fractions of inhaled particles per adult nasal respiration of 1.2 m 3 /h in each region re-calculated for the nasopharynx, tracheobronchial, and the pulmonary (alveolar) region based on the model. Inhaled aerosol particles deposit on different regions depending on their size; for example, nanoparticles larger than 10 nm deposit mostly in the alveoli and those less than 10 nm deposit in the nasal cavity. How deeply particles penetrate into the lung depends on their size. Nanoparticles can reach pulmonary region in the lung and deposit more intensively and this, therefore, has become one of the reasons for concern about the effects of nanoparticles on human health. However, deposition of nanoparticle chain-like agglomeration and fibrous particles such as carbon nanotubes cannot be estimated by this model. Most inhaled nanoparticles are deposited on the surface of the respiratory tract. Generally, if insoluble particles are deposited in the ciliated airspaces which are lined with a mucous layer, they are transported to the digestive tract with the mucous flow by mucociliary movements. Particles deposited on nonciliated bronchioles and alveoli are phagocytosed by macrophages, which is a kind of white blood cell. As a result, their residence time is longer, however, they are usually transported to the ciliated upper part of the respiratory tract. Removal of deposited particles described above is called clearance. When the amount of deposited particles is below a certain value, no health effect is produced. In relation to a macrophage response to particles, crystalline silica is hazardous, whereas titanium dioxide is not. Pneumoconiosis is a well-known lung disease that is caused by exposure to dust particles of several micrometers in diameter. Silicosis is a typical form of pneumoconiosis resulting from exposure to crystalline silica dust and characterized by a progressive fibrosis of the lungs. The macrophage-mediated clearance (phagocytes) was effective for micron and submicron particles. It has been reported that only 20% of deposited nanoparticles were removed by the clearance mechanism [8] . It has been suggested that the remaining nanoparticles may pass through the alveolar walls, penetrate into the blood or lymphatic circulation, and be transported to other organs. Many studies have shown that the smaller the particle size the greater the mobility or they pass easily through the alveolar wall and enter into the bloodstream. It is further presumed that the mechanism of health effects of nanoparticles on cardiovascular system other than the respiratory tract is similar to that in the airborne ultrafine particles from DEP.",

Their results have been frequently cited in the discussion of whether the health effects of fine particles should be based on its mass or its surface area. In Fig. 7.3.4 , percentages of neutrophils in lung lavage of rats are shown as indicators of inflammation after intratracheal instillation of different mass doses of 20 and 250 nm TiO 2 particles. The steeper dose response of nanosized TiO 2 particles is observed than for submicron TiO 2 particles when the dose is expressed as mass (Fig. 7.3.4A ). If the same dose-response relationship as in Fig.7. 3.4A is indicated as particle surface area (Fig. 7. 3.4B), the particle surface area seems to be a more appropriate dosimetric for comparing effects of different-sized particles of the same chemical structure.",

The applications cover even biomedical engineering in addition to information technology, material, environmental science, and energy production [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . As the result, many kinds of new materials have been designed, fabricated, and discarded. From now on, this movement will be accelerated and even more new functional materials will be distributed in the world. Here, we should not forget the safety of those materials in the process of the production, usage, and discard. Without this safety assessment, we will go into the same problems as that of asbestos just we are facing now. First of all, we have to conduct experiments to reveal the minimal concentration for emergence of the toxicity. In other words, we have to fix the standard value for the threshold concentration for each material first of all. If we do not fix it, we should not use the material at any concentration, which means any engineering process could not be carried out. The applications in the various fields have started all over the world, and the safety assessment is urgently needed. In this article, we introduce the methods of the safety assessment of the semiconductor nanoparticles and describe the safety and the threshold depending on the surface treatment.",

The MTT is a kind of tetrazolium, whose molecular formula is C 18 H 16 BrN 5 S. Taken into a cell, it is decomposed by a dehydrogenase enzyme in a mitochondrium into a pigment called 'hormazan'. The measurement of the fluorescence intensity of the pigment shows the prolification of the cell [8] [9] [10] . Fig. 7 .3.5. shows the hazard assessment of Vero cells and kidney cells of the African Green Monkey against CdSe/ZnS nanoparticles. The horizontal axis shows the concentrations of the nanoparticles and the vertical axis the fluorescence intensity of the hormazan at 460 nm, that is, the metabolism of the cells. The figure indicates that cyto-toxicity is not observed for 10 5 cells when the concentration is less than 0.5 M. This result means that this concentration is the threshold of the cell toxicity. Likewise, cyto-toxicity is not observed for the HeLa cells and for the human primary cells. Further, in order to find out how the sizes of nanoparticles influence the cyto-toxicity, the cyto-toxicities were evaluated with three kinds of quantum dots; one whose fluorescence wavelength is 640 nm, red, one with 570 nm, yellow, and the other with 520 nm, green. The following results were obtained. The largest quantum dots whose fluorescence wavelength is 640 nm show a tendency to give cyto-toxicity. Cyto-toxicity is observed at concentrations more than 1 M [11] .",

Therefore, the migration velocities or displacement of a particle per second due to the individual forces gives the basis for the comparison of removal efficiencies due to each force. In Fig. 7 .4.2, migration velocities of particles due to various forces are depicted against particle diameter at normal temperature and pressure for particle density of 1 g/cm 3 [1] . As seen from the figure, the velocities due to gravity, centrifugal force, and inertia monotonically decrease with decreasing particle diameter, suggesting that the removal of nanoparticles with these forces is difficult. On the contrary, the velocities due to Brownian diffusion and electrostatic forces increase with decreasing particle diameter for particles less than 100 nm. This suggests that Brownian diffusion and electrostatic forces are most effective in collecting nanoparticles. Fig. 7 .4.3 summarizes typical conventional dust collectors. Among them, the effective collectors for nanoparticles are ESP and fabric/air filter. However, for the case of ESP, which relies on only electrostatic force, nanoparticles (\u03fd 10 nm) fail to carry even one electron resulting in low collection efficiency. In this case electrically charged filters are effective because we can expect the combined effects of electrostatic forces and Brownian diffusion.",

Particle penetration data of electret filter are plotted against particle diameter in Fig. 7 .4.4 and compared with that of uncharged filter with the same structure. For the three combinations of charged states of fiber and particle there exist the most penetrating particle diameters. For the uncharged fiber, collection efficiency of uncharged particle has a minimum at 100 nm and increases with decreasing particle diameter, showing that 100 nm is the most penetrating particle size. For the charged fiber, particle collection efficiency is very high even for uncharged particle, and the efficiency for charged nanoparticles is extremely high because of strong Coulombic force between fiber and particle. The experimental data plotted in Fig. 7 .4.4 are qualitatively in good agreement with the theoretical prediction following the particle size dependency on particle migration velocity (shown in Fig. 7.4.2 ). However, as particle size becomes smaller and comparable with the size of a molecule, particles may rebound on a collector surface, and the adhesion probability of particles drops, resulting in a decrease in collection efficiency. Fig. 7 .4.5 is an example of experimental data that confirm the particle rebound [2] . The figure shows the penetration of nanoparticles through a grounded circular tube. The solid curve is the theoretical line derived by assuming that particles are deposited from a laminar flow in a tube by Brownian diffusion. It is evident that experimental penetration deviates from the theoretical line for particles less than 2 nm. This means that molecular behavior begins to appear when the particle size becomes as small as 2 nm, and as a result, the collection efficiency is reduced.",

The titanium dioxide particles are destabilized around the isoelectric point where the van der Waals attraction is more dominant. Consequently, the particle tends to come together, that is, to flocculate, and the very porous flocs are then formed. Thus, it is speculated that the filter cake formed from such porous flocs has often loose and wet structures. On the other hand, the filter cake becomes compact and dry when the particle carries the charge. Since the most loose filter cake forms around the isoelectric pH, the filter cake is most permeable. It is interesting to note that the results in protein UF had a distinctly different behavior. In protein UF of BSA solution, the filter cake is in its most compact state around the isoelectric point [6] , as shown in Fig. 7 .4.8. Since the BSA molecules are hydrophilic colloids, their stability in the solution would appear to be influenced not only by the presence of a surface charge on the protein but also by hydration of the surface layers of the protein. The BSA molecules, because of hydrated layers surrounding them, are not destabilized by such consideration as depression of the electrical double layer. Thus, the BSA molecules have water bound to them even around the isoelectric point. The hydrophilic BSA molecules maintain a dispersed state in the solution due to hydration of the surface layers of the protein even around the isoelectric point. When a BSA molecule acquires a charge, the filter cake becomes loose and wet due to electrostatic repulsion between the charged BSA molecules. This contrasts to the compact filter cake around the isoelectric point. The average specific filtration resistance av has a definite maximum around the isoelectric point since a compact filter cake provides a large hydraulic flow resistance.",

In the rotating cylinder device with the membrane on the inner rotating cylinder, counter-rotating Taylor vortices within the annular gap are available [12, 13] . Dean vortices that twist and spiral in the direction of flow inside a highly curved channel, similar to vortices in rotary modules can result in enhanced flux [14] .

Electrofiltration, in which an applied electric field is used to drive charged particles away from the membrane surface, has been developed. In electrofiltration, the accumulation of the particles on the membrane surface is limited by the imposed electrophoretic force. In addition, the permeate flux through the filter cake is dramatically enhanced due to electroosmosis as a secondary electrokinetic phenomenon. This method can be applied to a broad combination ranging from MF of particulate suspension such as bentonite [21] to UF of protein solution. Fig. 7 .4.10 shows the reciprocal permeate flux (d /dv) versus the permeate volume per unit membrane area, v, for various values of the strength of the DC electric field, E [22] . The steady permeate flux increases noticeably with the magnitude of the imposed field strength. Also, a higher electric field strength causes the permeate flux to equilibrate more rapidly.",

Fig. 7.4.12 shows the results for ultracentrifugal sedimentation of an aqueous solution of the mixtures of BSA and egg white lysozyme (pI 11.0, MW 14,300) measured using Schlieren optics in an analytical ultracentrifuge [24] . The angular acceleration of the rotor is 5,445 rad/s. The symbol r i and r i0 in the figure represent the distances from the center of rotation to the sedimentation boundary at time and 0 , respectively. The electrical nature of macromolecules plays a significant role in determining the sedimentation behavior in ultracentrifugation of binary protein mixtures. In the pH range where both protein molecules were electropositive, the molecules sediment independently due to the electrostatic repulsive force acting between BSA and lysozyme molecules.",
