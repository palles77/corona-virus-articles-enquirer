In North American populations, the death rate is lower, but figures are not available. Well-managed farms should aim to lose fewer than 5% of their crias in a year. In general, crias suffer from the same maladies as other neonatal livestock. Dysmaturity, prematurity, dystocia, sepsis, and starvation are common problems and should be handled in the same way as in other species. In contrast, crias appear to have higher rates of certain problems such as those related to congenital malformations.",

Given how rapidly sick neonates can deteriorate, even these small abnormalities may indicate the need for aggressive action. Abnormalities are best detected through a thorough postnatal checkup, routine, consistent monitoring of progress according to the timetable in Chapter 25, generally observing activities, including nursing, elimination, and physical activity, and charting changes in size and body weight. Even small changes such as failure to gain weight over a 24-hour period while all else appears normal could be significant, and any delay in investigating these changes and initiating treatment could result in more advanced clinical disease. Interventions may be anything from modest management changes to intensive medical care. Identifying the neonates that require interventions and determining the level are matters of experience and good diagnostic evaluation.",

Breathing is the most urgent. Crias with overt dyspnea, including openmouthed breathing or stertorous respiration, should be maintained in sternal recumbency or assisted to stand. The airway should be assessed for obstruction. The external nares should be cleared. A bulb syringe may be used to blow mucus back into the oropharynx, and a soft rubber urinary catheter may be inserted past the level of the eye in each nares for a quick assessment of choanal patency. Rubbing the thorax and dorsum also may stimulate breathing efforts. Breathing function may be assessed by arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis and thoracic radiography, and endoscopy or imaging studies may be used to assess airway patency (see Chapter 37) . If hypoxemia is a concern, the cria may be placed on supplemental oxygen, and if ventilation is an issue, the cria may be intubated for mechanical ventilation. Face masks used for small animal patients may be tolerated in the short term but are hard to maintain. Nasal prongs used in human hospitals work well for crias and are self-retaining. Insufflation tubes or catheters placed in a nostril are also acceptable. When possible, supplemental oxygen should be warmed and humidified. Assessment of breathing function may be indicated even in the absence of dyspnea. Hypoxemia and hypercapnea are both important causes of neonatal obtundation, so supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation should be considered in any dull cria. Moribund crias are at risk of corneal ulcers because of reduced blinking reflexes. Ocular lubricants and common sense management to avoid eye trauma may be indicated.",

Pulmonary auscultation is the same as in other species. Some degree of \"squeakiness\" is normal in the immediate postpartum period, but this should resolve within an hour.

Placing a towel under the abdomen may increase intraabdominal pressure and restrict breathing and may even promote body wall hernias.

If milk is administered in the absence of colostrum, plasma transfusion should be strongly considered. Although it has not yet been studied scientifically, some think that camelid milk has metabolic effects beyond simple nutrition, so any cria fed milk or milk replacer from another species should be observed carefully for changes in attitude or activity that could reflect the onset of a hyperglycemic disorder (see Chapter 41, \"Hyperosmolar Disorder\").

Tendon laxity (see later in this chapter and in Chapter 58) may result in overextension of the carpal and fetlock joints, so crias may be seen walking on their fetlocks ( Figure 42 -3). Crias may also have a rubbery covering on the nails of the feet and a thicker epidermal membrane that persists for longer than normal. The central incisors normally erupt 2 to 3 weeks prior to birth, so unerupted incisors suggest that a cria is underdeveloped at least to this extent. Dymature crias tend to be weak and may have difficulty standing or holding their heads up to nurse because of poor muscle development. Furthermore, dysmature crias may have incomplete structural and functional maturation of vital body systems, and this leaves them susceptible to a range of potential neonatal complications. These crias are at risk for hypothermia because their thermoregulatory control is poor, and they are prone to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Respiratory system immaturity may result in poor lung expansion from lack of pulmonary surfactant, and this also reduces oxygen transfer across the alveoli. Poor oxygen diffusion together with bradypnea results in hypoxia. It is unknown when surfactant is produced in the lungs of camelids, but those with unerupted incisors are especially at risk. The intestinal mucosa may also be inadequately mature in premature crias, which results in inefficient absorption of colostral antibodies. More than half the dysmature crias presenting to one referral hospital had FPT. 1 Recognizing the clinical signs of dysmaturity is vital for newborn crias, as they may deteriorate rapidly. Early intervention is key to their survival. One report showed a 75% survival rate, and this was attributed to the fact that 87.5% of cases were presented within 24 hours of birth. 1 Therapeutic measures may include oxygen administration, IV fluid administration, and provision of warmth. The contents and rate of administered fluids should be tailored to the specific needs and blood abnormalities; nutritional support should not be neglected. Additionally, aminophylline (2 mg/kg, subcutaneously [SQ], q4h for 24 hours, followed by q6h for the next 24 hours and q8h for the next 24 hours) may be used proactively or therapeutically when concerns about breathing exist. Lung surfactants have also seen some use.",

Hyperfibrinogenemia, a leftshifted leukogram, and toxic changes in leukocytes both provide supportive evidence for sepsis but also may be absent in septic crias. The stress response, with its tendency to increase blood neutrophil counts, may mask neutropenia, so it is important to look for other evidence of stress (hyperglycemia, lymphopenia) and to mentally compensate for these: A normal neutrophil count in a stressed camelid, especially one with a left shift or toxic morphology of neutrophils may still be evidence of sepsis. Mycoplasma haemolamae infection has also been identified in newborns and may be identified on blood smear or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 4 Measuring plasma Ig concentrations also may provide indirect evidence of sepsis. Low immunoglobulin G (IgG) in a neonate may either be a predisposing factor to sepsis, often related to FPT, or reflect Ig consumption caused by infection.

It with diarrhea and others with apparent renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis without dehydration has also been described. 6 The pathogenesis of this is not completely understood. Crias occasionally get lactic acidosis from grain overload or fermentation of milk, but hyperlactemia is more commonly the result of septic or hypovolemic shock. Ketoacidosis is also seen. Treatment of acidosis depends partially on the pathogenesis. With lactic acidosis or ketoacidosis, the primary strategies are to decrease production and increase elimination of the organic acid. Both these may often be achieved by rehydration. Ketoacidosis may also require the same treatment as that for hepatic lipidosis, and intestinal fermentative conditions may need to be treated in the same way as grain overload. If the blood pH is below 7.25, bicarbonate administration may be necessary as well. Sodium bicarbonate administration is also the cornerstone of treatment of bicarbonate-losing conditions, particularly when blood pH is less than 7.25. Multiplying the base deficit (or 24 mEq/L minus the observed bicarbonate value) by 0.5 by body weight in kilograms yields the total bicarbonate deficit. Half of this may be given within the first hour of fluids and the second half over the next 2 to 4 hours. Bicarbonate administration often temporarily corrects acidosis, but repeated monitoring is necessary to determine whether further doses should be given. Bicarbonate should also be avoided with respiratory acidosis, as hypercapnea may worsen.",

Camelid milk may also play a role in suppressing hyperglycemia. The most likely causes for hypoglycemia are inadequate milk intake, potentially compounded by shivering or seizures, sepsis, or liver failure. If hypoglycemia is identified, it should be addressed promptly. The seizure threshold in crias appears to be just under 40 mg/ dL (2.22 mmol/L) of glucose, so supplemental glucose is recommended for anything less than 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).

Very high glucose concentrations may be combated with insulin (regular insulin, 0.2 units/kg, IV, as often as hourly) or less aggressively with subcutaneous insulin. The combination of hyperglycemia and hyperna tremia is termed hyperosmolar disorder. Its pathogenesis and treatment are discussed in Chapter 41. Hypernatremia and hyperchloremia are much more common in sick crias (roughly 14%) than hyponatremia or hypochloremia (roughly 1%), so salt loading should be avoided under most conditions. Hypokalemia (38% of sick crias) caused by anorexia is relatively common and may be addressed by IV supplementation or milk feeding. Vigorous supplementation is rarely necessary. Azotemia was found in 14% of sick crias in one unpublished study. The minority of these had renal failure or congenital abnormalities; most were in hypovolemic or septic shock and responded well to fluids. Evidence of fat mobilization was not uncommon, and hepatic lipidosis was found in 12% of nonsurviving, live-born crias, with the youngest being 2 days old. These findings highlight the need for nutritional support, and that factors beyond pregnancy-related or lactation-related negative energy balance may lead to disorders of fat metabolism in camelids. Hyperlipemia, high blood concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) or \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (BHOB) or high activities on liver enzymes all suggest such a disorder might be developing.

Additionally, premature neonates are likely to have inadequate reserves of brown adipose tissue, which develop late in gestation under the influence of NST inhibitors. Shivering generates additional heat, but the impact of this is small in neonates because of their small size and immature musculature. The presence of brown adipose tissue has not been specifically documented in camelids to date, so the extent of the role of NST in averting hypothermia in crias is uncertain. Thyroid hormones may also play a role in enhancing thermogenesis in the newborn. Neonatal llama crias have been shown to have very high blood thyroxine concentrations at birth, which decrease gradually over the first 90 days of life. 9 Crias born in cooler environmental temperatures, particularly in winter, are especially susceptible to hypothermia because of the greater temperature differential and the potential for increased heat losses from evaporation from a wet neonate. The epidermal membrane helps prevent some of this evaporative cooling but disintegrates soon after birth. Therefore, if females are expected to give birth during cooler periods of the year, they should be watched particularly closely or brought indoors so that parturition occurs in a warmer location. Ideally, matings in cold climates should be scheduled so that the birthing season occurs during the spring or summer months to minimize this problem.",

Hypoglycemia, although uncommon, may develop concurrently as hypothermic neonates deplete their energy reserves. Additionally, prolonged hypothermia may result in damage to the intestinal epithelium because of hypoxia, predisposing the neonate to clostridial overgrowth and pathogen invasion. 11 Crias with hypothermia should be warmed. This involves placing them in a warmer environment away from drafts, drying them off if they are wet, and using external heat sources such as heat lamps, warmed towels and blankets, and hot water bottles. Forced-air warming blankets are particularly effective in crias because of the relatively larger surface area. If heating pads or lamps are used, appropriate insulation from direct heat should be used, and care must be taken to ensure that a recumbent cria is turned frequently to avoid overheating. Excessive heat may result in cutaneous vasodilation, which may be detrimental to the cria by reducing core temperature and resulting in further cardiovascular compromise. This is also true of warm water bathing, which is therefore not recommended. Caution must be exercised if heat lamps are used because some bulbs may pose a fire hazard.

However, treated crias also showed a reduction in lung volume, and it was suggested that this may result in complications for those crias having preexisting cardiopulmonary compromise. Therefore, greater care would be advised in administering large-volume plasma transfusions to any cria with suspicion of cardiopulmonary issues or systemic disease.

At rectal temperatures higher than 41.5\u00b0C (106.7\u00b0F), the body's normal thermoregulation fails, peripheral vasoconstriction occurs, and cardiac output falls with reduction in blood pressure. 10 Organ failure, coagulopathy, and myocardial necrosis may develop subsequently. Seizures may occur at these temperatures because of alterations in the function of temperaturesensitive ion channels and also the production of the pyrogenic cytokine IL-1\u03b2 that has been shown to enhance neuronal excitability. 14 Relatively small increases in brain temperature predispose the brain to hypoxic injury. 8 If hyperthermia is identified in a neonate, it is likely to be significant, and therefore the clinician should attempt to identify the underlying cause and provide the appropriate treatment. It is particularly important to rule out or identify bacterial infection, since mortality rates may be high if this is not treated early and aggressively (see \"Sepsis\" below).

It may also occur in crias shown previously to have acceptable passive transfer.",

Their oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is shifted to the left of those of humans and many other mammals, so camelid hemoglobin (Hb) has increased affinity for oxygen in the lungs, allowing high oxygen saturation of Hb (\u226590%) even at high altitude and low inspired oxygen concentrations. [18] [19] [20] However, the oxygen is released just as easily in the tissues, reflecting good oxygen extraction to meet the demands of tissue hypoxia. Fetal llamas have been shown to have even more efficient tissue oxygen extraction. 21 Llamas and alpacas have been shown to exhibit a much reduced pulmonary vasoconstrictive response to hypoxia such that they are resistant to the development of pulmonary hypertension at altitude. 22 Furthermore, the fetal llama, in contrast to lowland species, has been shown to respond to acute hypoxia with intense peripheral vasoconstriction and only a modest increase in cerebral blood flow with reduced oxygen consumption, indicating hypometabolism, even in the brain. 23 Presumably, the large decrease in peripheral oxygen consumption preserves available supplies for the brain. The fetal llama heart also receives an increase in blood flow in response to hypoxia. These fetal responses appear to be preserved into the neonatal period. 24 Therefore, the physiologic adaptations of these species may explain why neonates are better able to survive hypoxia in association with congenital heart defects compared with other domestic species.",

If this is unavailable, or during the gap between presentation and confirmation of abnormalities, supplemental oxygen may be administered on the basis of suspicion of hypoxemia. If the patient is breathing poorly or has hypercapnea, mechanical or assisted ventilation may be required, if other treatments do not improve the respiratory effort. Generally, supplemental oxygen is recommended whenever partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) falls below 60 mm Hg and ventilation is recommended whenever partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) exceeds 60 mm Hg. Supplemental oxygen may be administered using oxygen tents or cages or more commonly via nasal catheter. It is usually sufficient to administer 2 to 4 liters per hour (L/hr) of 100% oxygen. This is effective or partially effective at combating hypoxemia caused by diffusion barriers and ventilation-perfusion mismatches but is not effective when blood is bypassing the lung because of a right-to-left shunt. Efficacy may be checked by comparing including respiratory tract or cardiovascular anatomy; the presence of abnormal fluids, tissues, or infection affecting areas of air movement or gas exchange; mental or physical impairment of ventilation; abnormal blood flow patterns through the lung; and other factors. Some of these factors are more likely to be identified during the neonatal period than in older animals, particularly those relating to anatomic defects or infection.

In human neonates and foals, seizure activity may not necessarily be convulsive and may include tremors and involuntary muscle activity, including lip smacking, rapid eye movements, and small limb movements. 25 This is also the case with alpaca and llama neonates. Seizures always indicate abnormal brain activity. In neonates, seizures may be caused by a number of factors, some of which may be intracranial in origin such as traumatic brain injury, cerebral edema, polioencephalomalacia, or encephalitis, whereas others may be extracranial, including electrolyte abnormalities, hypoglycemia, hypoxemia or ischemia, and hepatic or uremic encephalopathy (see . Hydrocephalus may be the result of an intracranial or extracranial lesion. The most common causes of seizures animals with cardiac problems may be helpful, if available. 33 Clinical signs of collapse, weakness, and cold extremities indicate reduced systemic perfusion, but these are not exclusive to cardiac problems. Occasionally, neonates with congenital heart disease present with signs of \"exercise intolerance.\" Examples include a cria that struggles to keep up with its dam or one that finds nursing behavior exhausting and stands with its head down to the ground for long periods. Syncope may sometimes be a feature. Left-sided congestive heart failure (CHF) may result in signs such as coughing consistent with pulmonary edema or an increased respiratory rate and effort. Right-sided CHF may result in hepatomegaly or ascites. Abnormal blood flow to the GI tract may result in abdominal discomfort or colic in some cases, and pleural effusion may cause dyspnea. 31 Distension of the jugular veins may sometimes be evident in neonates with right-sided failure. For crias with slower developing failure, poor growth is the most common complaint.",

In contrast to the abdomen of adults, the abdomen of neonates is more amenable to external palpation. Without the interference of a feed-filled first compartment, it is often possible to palpate specific enlarged organs or the intestinal loops distended by gas or fluid. Enlargement of organs may result in significant pain from stretching of the capsule; this is particularly true of the kidneys and ureters and, to a lesser extent of the liver and bladder. 35 Interpretation of blood and abdominal fluid follows the guidelines laid out in Chapter 40. Radiography and ultrasonography are also invaluable diagnostic tools, depending on the level of expertise in interpretation. Ultrasonography is particularly useful for detecting fluid accumulation within the forestomach, bowel, or peritoneal cavity and allows for assessment of intestinal contents, wall thickness, and motility, as well as examination of other abdominal organs, including the liver, the spleen, and the urinary tract.

Concurrent rectovaginal fistula may allow gas or fecal material to pass and possibly delay recognition. 38, 39 During embryologic development, a caudal growth of mesenchymal tissue (the cloaca) becomes divided into two chambers by the urorectal fold. These chambers later become the rectum and urogenital sinus. Failure of the anal membrane to open results in atresia ani, a rectovaginal fistula forms if the urorectal fold fails to develop properly. A rectovaginal fistula allowed atresia ani to remain undetected in a female alpaca until it was evaluated at 3 years of age for breeding soundness. 38 A 3-day-old alpaca cria with atresia recti and a small rectovaginal fistula, through which only air could pass, strained intermittently and had only mild abdominal distension with reduced intestinal sounds on auscultation. 37 Crias with atresia ani or recti typically present within the first 3 days of life. Earliest detection is by handlers seeking to give an enema or determine the rectal temperature. Clinical signs may vary, but typically a history of tenesmus exists, and with delayed recognition, abdominal distension or pain on palpation of the abdomen may develop. Affected individuals presenting later may have weight loss, lethargy, and a poor appetite. The diagnosis is fairly evident upon examination of the perineal region because of the presence of a bulge or lack of the anal orifice. It may be difficult to determine the depth of the defect and whether it is amenable to surgical correction. Gentle pressure applied to the abdomen while observing the perineal area may allow a bulge to appear, but this is not particularly reliable as a prognostic indicator. Radiographic images demonstrate whether gas is present within the pelvis or extends into the perineal area. Ultrasonography of the perineum may demonstrate the distance from the skin to the blind end of the bowel. In the absence of other complicating defects, atresia ani is amenable to surgical management, but it is important to discuss the potential for heritability with the owner. That being said, if the caudal pouch of the rectum is not too deep, corrective surgery is not overly challenging, and most corrected animals may be healthy, albeit nonbreeding, members of the herd. Surgical correction is performed by making either a linear or preferably a circular incision over the presumed site of the anus, blunt dissection to identify the caudal extent of the rectal pouch, and then a rectal pullthrough procedure (see Figure 40 -64). The rectal serosa is sutured to the perineal skin by using a simple interrupted pattern. Sutures are placed at the lateral margins first, then dorsally and ventrally, and finally in between until 12 sutures have been made around the margin. It is preferable to perform this surgery with the cria fully anesthetized and intubated, as sometimes it may take time to locate the rectal pouch. Sedation with epidural anesthesia is a less desirable option. Perioperative antibiosis should be continued for 5 to 7 days, when the incision site has healed. The cria should be monitored for normal defecation, GI function, and behavior. Some crias outgrow the correction and may require a second surgery later, if they start straining again. The same surgery is performed for atresia recti, provided the portion of atretic rectum is not too long to achieve adequate mobilization. of adults (see Chapter 40) . Lateral views of the standing cria are easier to interpret than views taken in lateral recumbency because of the movement of gas and fluid within the bowel. When possible, a ventrodorsal or dorsoventral image should be taken for comparison. Sedation is rarely required in neonates; neonatal crias tolerate positioning with sandbags and foam wedges well, even in dorsal recumbency. Timm et al. (1999) published a useful paper on the radiographic appearance of the normal GI tract of neonatal crias and also performed a barium study to evaluate transit times. 36 These investigators used barium sulfate at a dose of 11 mL/kg, diluted with water in a ratio of 1 : 3 and found that this dose provided good morphologic definition. In neonates that were fed barium diluted with water via an oroesophageal tube, contrast consistently entered C1 but emptied from C1 and C2 at a mean time following tubing of 11.25 hours (range of 4 to 22.5 hours). In bottle-fed neonates, contrast was transported directly into C3. They found that the total transit time of the barium through the GI tract was long compared with that in foals, with barium entering the ascending colon at a mean time of 25 hours (range 16-37 hours) and still remaining in the ascending colon at the end of the study for up to 48 to 72 hours. Contrast studies may be useful in investigating crias that are not defecating or have vague signs of abdominal discomfort, particularly if the clinical condition does not necessitate immediate surgery. Because of the long period before the emptying of the large intestine, it may not be possible to rule out suspected colonic atresia until contrast is seen clearly in the rectum. Furthermore, intestinal motility may also be impaired in neonates with GI problems, making interpretation problematic. From the results of their contrast study in neonatal crias, investigators recommended timing of radiography at every 20 minutes for the first 2 hours and then hourly for 12 hours until barium reaches the spiral colon. Thereafter, images are made every 6 hours until 36 hours after barium administration, followed by radiographs taken at 12 hourly intervals, if required. 36 Depending on the site of interest, this schedule could be modified to reduce the amount of radiation exposure.",

            "text": "Atresia of the jejunum, colon, rectum, and anus all have been identified in neonatal camelids, with atresia ani being the most common. [37] [38] [39] In other species, the origin of these defects is controversial. Both heritable and nonheritable factors may be involved. In cattle, atresia coli may be the result of damage to the embryonic colonic vasculature occurring during rectal palpation of the amniotic vesicle in early gestation; a genetic predisposition may exist among Holstein-Friesian cattle. 40, 41 Atresia coli is believed to be inherited in humans, whereas in horses, a pattern of simple recessive inheritance has been identified along with postulated sporadic cases. [42] [43] [44] [45] Atresia ani is believed to be inherited in cattle and pigs. 46, 47 In camelids, most intestinal malformations are thought to be heritable, although true data are lacking; atresia ani has been reported anecdotally in related llamas. Some cases may also be sporadic and arise from random mutations or unidentified environmental influences; rectal palpation is not commonly Prior to attempting surgical correction, it is important to discuss the possibility of atresia coli being heritable and that the animal should probably not be used for breeding. To improve the chances of a good outcome, it is essential that hydration, acid-base status, and electrolyte imbalances be corrected, as needed, and good postoperative care must be provided. One study in calves showed that almost a third of calves with atresia coli had concurrent FPT, so this should be addressed. 51 Preexisting sepsis makes a cria a more challenging candidate for surgery. The prognosis for calves undergoing corrective surgery is relatively poor, with discharge rates reported between 35% and 44%. [51] [52] [53] Information about survival rates in crias is not available. Surgery is optimally performed under general anesthesia via a ventral midline or right flank incision. After identification of the atretic portion of bowel, an end-to-side colocolic anastomosis is recommended to minimize postoperative ileus and stenosis at the site of anastomosis. 51, 53 Right midflank colostomy, a salvage procedure in calves, offers superior short-term survival but is not likely to be esthetically acceptable to camelid owners. 48 Umbilical, diaphragmatic, or inguinal hernias may potentially cause clinical signs of abdominal pain and distension if the herniated segment of bowel becomes entrapped or strangulated. 54, 55 It is the same case with intussusception. 56 The spiral colon or jejunum are most commonly involved. Affected crias present with clinical findings similar to those described above. Usually, it takes days to months for entrapment to develop. Older crias may have a history of normal passage of feces prior to the onset of clinical signs. External hernias should be palpable on clinical examination, whereas internal ones require imaging studies or surgical exploration.",

In crias, meconium is normally a sticky orange-colored semicylindrical lump, but it may also come in the form of rice grain-sized pellets coated with thick orange-colored mucus. Ingestion of colostrum is thought to aid in its passage, so meconium impaction may be more likely in crias that fail to nurse. Transient meconium impaction is fairly common. Affected crias typically exhibit nonproductive straining starting around 24 hours of age and worsening with time. The impaction may be relieved by instilling a 20 to 30 mL warm soapy water enema via a well-lubricated soft rubber catheter inserted 10 to 15 cm into the rectum. The cria should posture to defecate very shortly thereafter. Sometimes a second enema is required, but repeated enemas may promote tenesmus from mucosal irritation. Persistent impactions may be treated with retention enemas containing 4% acetylcysteine. This should be left in place for 15 to 45 minutes to allow better dissociation of meconium. If enema treatment is unsuccessful, especially when no fecal matter has been passed, the possibility of atresia should be considered.",

The one reported case was in a 10-day-old cria that had been doing poorly since 2 days of age. Calves with atresia coli have been reported to survive as long as 19 days before diagnosis, and one recent study showed that the age of presentation of calves with atresia coli ranged from 3 to 18 days, whereas those with atresia ani presented at less than 4 days old. 40, 48 Owners may report that they had not seen the cria pass feces and had seen straining, but occasionally some material may have been seen at the anus. This may be mucus and epithelial cells from the lining of the bowel mistaken for fecal material, particularly if the atretic portion of bowel is more proximal. Crias may initially be observed to do well for the first day or two of life and then start to do poorly, becoming dull and lethargic. Abdominal distension is progressive, and affected crias tend to exhibit a painful response on abdominal palpation. A gentle digital rectal examination may yield only mucus. Abdominal ultrasonography and radiographic studies ( Figure 42-5) should show loops of distended intestine, consistent with intestinal obstruction. Hematologic and biochemistry findings are initially normal but become abnormal with progression of cardiovascular compromise and secondary complications. Differential diagnoses for the clinical findings described would be other forms of intestinal atresia, intestinal impaction or volvulus, intussusception, and diffuse peritonitis. Other potential differential diagnosis for neonatal crias with abdominal distension and pain, as well as constipation and lethargy, would be coccidiosis or clostridial enterotoxemia. Only 27% of crias with clostridiosis in one report had diarrhea, and it also appears to be an inconsistent finding with coccidiosis. 49, 50 With clostridiosis, death usually followed within 1 to 2 days after the onset of clinical signs. accumulation is excessive or the result of inflammation or a compromised viscus, pain signs may be present as well.

Ultrasonography clearly shows fluid swirling around in C1 where none should exist.

Usually, affected crias either are overfed (more than 15% of their body weight in a 24-hour period) or drink large volumes of milk rapidly from the bottle. Feeding smaller volumes at a higher frequency and using a bottle with a small nipple orifice may help prevent this. This technique may also be employed to treat affected crias. Ideally, C1 should be emptied, but this may be difficult with a stomach tube and carries a risk of aspiration. Reduced milk feeding may also help in the short term, but it is important to continue to provide hydration and meet the energy demands with IV fluids and parenteral nutrition.

However, this risk remains undefined, and progression of ulcers during hospital stays is poorly substantiated.

Oral PPIs are poorly absorbed in adult camelids, but no data on crias are available. 65,66 SQ (2 mg/kg) or IV (1 mg/kg) pantoprazole is Leukocytosis or leukopenia may exist, with degenerative left shift and toxic changes in the neutrophils. Hyperfibrinogenemia may develop over the first few days. Hypoproteinemia may be present as a result of FPT and hypogammaglobulinemia or because of leakage of protein into the abdomen. Ultrasonography may show an increase in the volume of peritoneal fluid and may suggest a possible source for the peritonitis. Occasionally, the quality of the ultrasonographic image appears to be suboptimal and might appear granular, an appearance that may be replicated on radiography. Definitive diagnosis is obtained by analysis and culture of the peritoneal fluid. Cytologic abnormalities include increases in nucleated cell counts, particularly by cells of the neutrophil line; the appearance of immature neutrophils or cells with toxic changes, possibly the appearance of intracellular or extracellular microorganisms; and also possibly the appearance of feed material. Peritoneal fluid protein concentrations are also usually high. In healthy adult alpacas and llamas, peritoneal fluid was found to contain up to 3000 total nucleated cells per microliter (cells/\u00b5L), with fewer than 2000 neutrophils/\u00b5L and protein concentration less than 2.5 g/dL. 59 Normal values have not been established for camelid neonates, but in healthy foals, the total nucleated cell counts are considerably lower than those seen in adults. 60 The most common isolates in crias without a leaking bowel are Escherichia coli and Streptococcus spp. Peritonitis caused by a single type of bacteria and without major morphologic changes to abdominal viscera may respond quickly to appropriate treatment. Infections with mixed populations of bacteria and related to compromised or abnormal viscera usually carry a grave prognosis and may require surgical intervention as well as medical treatment.",

The individual infectious agents tend to have characteristic clinical presentations, which help guide the clinician.

Therefore, it is preferable to perform a panel of diagnostic tests to identify all pertinent agents, as this ensures correct treatment or effective in adults and likely to be efficacious in crias as well. 67 Histamine receptor blockers have very short action in adults, even when given parenterally, and thus are unlikely to be effective at conventional doses in crias either. 65, 68 Gastric mucosal protectants have been used in camelids with the aim of aiding in healing of ulcers. Sucralfate (1 g, PO, q8-12h) binds to ulcerated tissue in the GI tract, thereby protecting the mucosa from further damage.

Azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperkalemia may be detected on blood analysis and are refractory to fluid treatment. Ultrasonography should permit identification of neonatal kidneys with ease, so an inability to find either or both kidneys raises suspicion. Contrast radiography or cross-sectional imaging techniques may be useful as well. Crias with one relatively normal kidney may escape detection, unless that kidney has a progressive condition or is otherwise damaged. One reported cria was presented at 4 days of age for inappetence and was treated for failure of passive transfer and sepsis but was brought back within a month with azotemia. Agenesis of the right kidney was suspected, and acute renal failure was diagnosed. 73 The diagnosis was confirmed at necropsy. No nephrotoxic drugs had been administered, but it is possible that the initial septicemic episode resulted in damage to the normal kidney. Another llama cria was suspected to have unilateral renal agenesis and unilateral renal hypoplasia. In this case, only a nodule of hyperechoic soft tissue was found at the expected site of one kidney, and the other was very small and did not appear to have normal kidney structure on ultrasonography. Azotemia was identified on biochemistry, and the cria was treated symptomatically as a neonate, but the azotemia persisted even when the cria appeared clinically well. This llama lived for about 2 years before being euthanized as a result of renal failure (J. Lakritz, personal communication). Even when it appears normal, the kidney contralateral to the hypoplastic one may harbor a degenerative process, so affected crias should be monitored closely.",

Sick neonatal camelids are often hypoproteinemic, so extra care must be taken when administering fluids to avoid potential complications such as pulmonary edema. Administration of colloids, especially plasma, helps prevent this and also addresses any underlying failure of passive transfer. With shock, initial crystalloid resuscitation may be achieved by using fluid boluses of up to 100 mL/kg over 15 to 30 minutes, but boluses greater than 20 mL/kg are rarely necessary, especially when followed by fluids at 2 to 4 mL/kg/hr. 79 Low sodium fluids are recommended in neonates with hypernatremia. Fluids may be administered continuously either as boluses every few hours or by continuous infusion, depending on what facilities are available. If a pump is not available, care must be taken not to underestimate the flow rate, particularly with positional catheters. Bolus administration is safer in this regard and allows the cria to stay with the dam. Allowing the cria to continue to nurse, if able, lowers stress and provides nutrition and water. Furosemide may be used to promote diuresis in cases with oliguria, preferably by constant rate infusion (0.66 mg/kg loading dose followed by 0.66 mg/kg/hr). However, its effects rely on furosemide reaching the lumen of the renal tubules, and this may be minimal in renal failure.",

Diseases primarily affecting other organ systems often result in renal compromise, so it is important to identify underlying disease processes and treat them and azotemia appropriately. Toxic causes of renal failure in neonates include nephrotoxic drugs such as gentamicin and oxytetracycline or oversupplementation of vitamin D to prevent rickets. 80 Vitamin D toxicity was reported in two neonatal alpacas with anuric acute renal failure.

Blood samples should be analyzed from any sick neonate to aid in prompt recognition of biochemical abnormalities so that appropriate treatment can be given and fluid therapy adjusted according to requirements. Ideally, a urine sample should be evaluated for specific gravity in order to differentiate renal from prerenal azotemia. Urinalysis (dipstick, quantitative tests, and cytology) is also helpful in diagnosing renal failure. High protein on a dipstick test should be evaluated quantitatively and in the light of other findings on urinalysis. Increased protein with bacteria, increased white blood cells, hemorrhage, or all of these may occur with infections of the urinary tract, whereas increased protein without these suggests loss of protein at the glomerulus. Finding casts on cytologic evaluation suggests tubular damage. Assessment of urine output and fractional excretion (FE) of sodium may also aid in determining renal function. Fractional excretions are best calculated before the administration of fluids. Low FE of sodium is most often the case in prerenal azotemia because of angiotensin-mediated sodium resorption, whereas in true renal disease, FE of sodium is usually markedly increased. followed by postoperative splint application.

[81] [82] [83] [84] They may affect the carpus, fetlock, or pastern, causing the affected joint to have limited extension. Various causes have been suggested in other species, including heredity, teratogens, and in utero positioning of the fetus. Arthrogryposis implies that flexural deformity is permanent and often affects multiple joints. In addition to the described causes for joint contracture, arthrogryposis may result from neurologic diseases or diseases that limit fetal movement. Arthrogryposis was found in only a small number of crias with congenital defects (21 of 895) in one study and was thought to be rare compared with the incidence in calves and lambs. 81 Most of the time, flexural deformity is relatively mild. If the pad of the foot continues to bear weight and the leg does not buckle with movement, contracture, like laxity, usually resolves as the animal walks around on it. If a cria has trouble standing or tries to walk on the dorsal aspect of the fetlock, manual stretching several times daily may resolve the problem. If physiotherapy alone is not successful, splinting the limb in as extended a position as possible may be required for up to 2 weeks. Padded gutter splints designed for dogs work well in crias, as do partial rounds of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping over cotton padding. Many affected crias are able to bear weight within a few days of splint application. The prognosis is worse for flexural deformities of carpus than for lower limb joints. If physical measures fail, radiography should be performed to ensure that the anatomy is normal before any more invasive and costly measures are undertaken. If arthrogryposis is suspected, diagnostic evaluation of the brain and spinal cord may be indicated as well. Suspensory ligament desmotomy was successful in one cria with bilateral flexural deformity of the carpal and fetlock joints. 82 Two earlier cases were less successful. One described bilateral transection of both superficial and deep flexor tendons, as well as the suspensory ligament in a 1-day-old llama that presented with severe flexural deformities of both metacarpophalangeal joints. 83 This resulted in ischemic necrosis of one distal limb at the level of the fetlock. In a second case report, wedge osteotomy of metacarpal bones III and IV was performed, but this resulted in luxation of the fetlock joint. 84 Another cria presented at 2 months of age with severe bilateral flexural deformities of the carpi (Figure 42-9 ). This cria was treated surgically by transection of the ulnaris lateralis and flexor carpi ulnaris tendons, back because of pain, and are typically smaller than agematched animals; herd mates may not be good comparators because they may also be affected.

Vitamin D 3 production is also seasonal; blood concentrations drop during the winter months because of reduced UV light availability. [90] [91] [92] Heavy cloud cover reduces UV penetration to Earth's surface. It is believed that reduced exposure to UV radiation at low altitudes and nonequatorial latitudes (i.e., outside of South America) reduces vitamin D activation in skin. It has also been suggested that dark pigmentation and thicker fleece in sheep reduce photobiosynthesis of vitamin D and that darker unsheared animals are therefore more susceptible to rickets. 92 Similar findings were found in alpacas in two separate reports. 86, 91 Camelid breeders in high-risk areas are advised to supplement crias using injectable vitamin D-containing products 2 or 3 times during the winter months to provide 1000 IU/kg body weight. 86 Most products also include vitamins A and E. The effects last approximately 2 months. Three injections are recommended in areas or years where the winter is particularly long and cloudy. Oral multivitamin formulations are available, but these require a more frequent dosing interval of approximately every 4 weeks. Treatment regimens for animals with rickets are similar. Some oral preparations are made for larger animals and are not particularly conducive to delivering accurate cria doses. Dosing should be based on actual body weight and not \"per cria\" since weights of crias vary from 5 kg to 45 kg. Overdosing may lead to toxic effects, including soft tissue mineralization and renal failure. 80 Vitamin D toxicity should be suspected in camelids with compatible history of vitamin D supplementation above the recommended doses, along with hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and renal dysfunction apparent on clinical chemistry. fetlocks, joint pain, and arthritis later in life. Correction of angular limb deformities may be achieved but must not be used to mask bad conformation.",

            "text": "Rickets in camelids has been reported in North America, New Zealand, Australia, and Europe. [85] [86] [87] [88] It is most severe in growing animals and is characterized by a failure of mineralization at the growth plates, resulting in increased depth of the cartilaginous growth plates and articular cartilage. These become distorted by the pressure of weight-bearing. 89 Changes are most obvious in sites where growth occurs rapidly, as in growth plates adjacent to the carpal and fetlock joints and the costochondral junctions of the ribs. Vertebral growth plates may be affected as well, possibly leading to secondary nerve impingement. Mineralization defects, including increased physeal and articular cartilage depth, irregular appearance of growth plates, metaphyseal flaring, and thinned cortices, may be seen readily on radiography (Figure 42-11) . Changes may be identified clinically as swollen, painful joints, pathologic fractures, and the classical \"rosary bead\" feel along the ribcage ( Figure 42-12) , which reflects enlargement of the costochondral junctions. Angular limb deformities may subsequently develop, and affected individuals show lethargy, have depressed appetites, may be lame and walk with a hunched ALD. Such procedures should be considered if required to improve quality of life for the patient. Bilateral wedge ostectomy of the distal radius was performed in one 14-month-old alpaca with severe bilateral carpal valgus of 40 degrees and 42 degrees and closed distal radial and ulnar growth plates. 93 The cria made a good recovery and was reported to be ambulatory 12 months postoperatively but with reduced carpal flexion. An 18-month-old llama had bilateral wedge ostectomy for a similar defect suspected to have been caused by premature closure of the distal ulnar physes. 94 For older crias with stunted growth and ALD caused by rickets, corrective surgery is likely to be less of an option. Vitamin D supplementation should be given to improve bone density before surgical options are considered. These crias are likely to remain stunted indefinitely.",

Cultures are often negative in spite of infection because the bacteria are more commonly associated with the synovial membrane and the patient may already have been treated with antibiotics. Treatment for septic arthritis should be initiated as early as possible to improve the prognosis. Ideally, joint lavage should be performed using warmed saline through wide-bore needles inserted into the joint (through-and-through lavage). In chronic cases, needle lavage may be inadequate, and arthroscopy should be considered to remove large fibrin deposits.

This may be confirmed by preadministration determination of serum vitamin D concentration. Carpal valgus is the ALD most amenable to surgical management. For crias affected by rickets, corrective surgery to address this deformity, combined with vitamin D supplementation, is likely to improve corresponding deformities at other sites such as at the fetlocks, since the angulation of these joints is also improved. The least invasive technique and one that is appropriate at an advanced stage is periosteal stripping. This may be combined with partial ulna ostectomy. The cria is placed under general anesthesia and positioned in dorsal recumbency. A 5-cm incision is made on the lateral aspect of the carpus, starting immediately proximal to the distal physis of the ulna and continued proximally. The incision is made right down to the bone, and the periosteum is elevated from the radius and ulna as far as can be reached in a cranial and caudal direction. Care must be taken to avoid damaging nearby ligaments. A small section of the distal ulna may be removed using bone rongeurs. The skin incision is then closed and light pressure dressings placed postoperatively for 7 to 10 days to reduce swelling. Reevaluation should be done 30 to 45 days following surgery to assess the adequacy of correction.",

At this point, transphyseal bridging of the radial growth plates may be done. This technique is effective in young animals that still have open growth plates and are still growing. In this case, the incision is made on the medial aspect of the carpus. The position of the radial growth plate is estimated using radiography as a guide, and 18-gauge needles are placed into the bone above and below the growth plate. These mark the intended locations for screw placement. Intraoperative craniocaudal radiography allows the surgeon to place screws correctly using the needles as guides. One cortical bone screw (2.7-mm or 3.5-mm diameter) is placed proximal and one distal to the medial aspect of the distal radial physis. Before tightening down the screws, an 18-to 20-gauge orthopedic wire is placed around them in a figure-of-8 pattern. A light pressure bandage is again placed postoperatively for 7 to 10 days. The owner needs to monitor the cria closely so that the bridge can be removed just when the deformity has been corrected. This normally occurs in 3 to 4 weeks.
