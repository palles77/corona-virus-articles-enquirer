Controlled studies 12, 14 have also shown that pilocarpine is safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse effect or drug interaction. As genetic predisposition and ethnicity affect the clinical manifestations and immunologic features of SS, [17] [18] [19] differences in the treatment responses to pilocarpine require investigation in different populations. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigated the clinical efficacy and safety of oral pilocarpine 5 mg four times daily for the improvement of oral symptoms in patients with SS in Taiwan.",

The most frequently used (>10%) medications were hydroxychloroquine sulfate (200-400 mg/day), antacids, low dose prednisolone (2.5-10 mg/day) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Use of these medications was similar between the pilocarpine and placebo groups. There was a similar dropout rate from the initial 44 patients, with 18 of 21 (85.7%) in the placebo group and 16 of 23 (69.6%) in the pilocarpine group completing the 3-month study (p = 0.29; Table 2 ). In the placebo group, one patient (4.8%) was lost to follow-up during the period of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan and two patients (9.6%) withdrew because of lack of efficacy. In contrast, none of the 23 patients in the pilocarpine group discontinued the study treatment due to lack of efficacy. In the pilocarpine group, three patients (13%) withdrew because of marked sweating and four (17.4%) were lost to follow-up. Of the four patients who were lost to follow-up, two withdrew during the SARS outbreak period. y The reasons for discontinuation from the study were not significantly different between the pilocarpine and placebo groups ( Table 2) . t Global assessment of xerostomia showed that a significant proportion of patients in the pilocarpine group (69.6%) had improvement in the sensation of dry mouth compared to the placebo group (23.8%) in the intention-to-treat analysis (p = 0.0032; Figure 1 ). Patients taking pilocarpine four times daily also showed significant improvement in xerostomia-related conditions, such t as ability to sleep and ability to speak without (Figure 2 ). Borderline significance (p = 0.07) in the ability to chew and swallow was observed in the pilocarpine group compared to the placebo group. Three patients in the placebo group and four in the pilocarpine group were denture wearers, but none of the patients in either group had significant improvement in the ability to wear dentures. However, analysis of VAS scores between the pilocarpine and placebo groups indicated a significant improvement (p < 0.01) in the pilocarpine group in five of six specific dry mouth symptoms, including mouth dryness, mouth comfort, ability to sleep, ability to speak and ability to swallow food (all p < 0.01) compared to baseline.",

In this study, patients with SS in Taiwan who received pilocarpine experienced global improvement of xerostomia, significant improvement in most of the symptoms associated with dry mouth including mouth dryness, mouth comfort, ability to sleep, ability to speak, and ability to swallow food, and an increase in saliva secretion from baseline without serious adverse effects and drug-drug interactions.

            "text": "In SS, the deficient secretory response of salivary and lacrimal glands leading to dry mouth and dry eyes is attributed to both a decrease in the f number of secretory units and a dysfunction of the residual secretory units. 25 Despite dysfunction, the residual glandular elements in these exocrine glands preserve their neural innervation 26 and have upregulation of muscarinic receptors. 27 Therefore, the excess of muscarinic receptors in the exocrine glands provides a target for the therapeutic use of a secretagogue to stimulate secretion from exocrine glands in patients with SS. 8, 13 t It is conceivable that the physiologic roles and the protective functions of saliva include lubrication, digestion, phonation, mastication, remineralization, maintenance of balance of oral microflora, buffer activity, and immunity and defense. Hence, the administration of a secretagogue like pilocarpine to stimulate saliva production is preferred to the use of a saliva substitute for the treatment of dry mouth in SS patients. 2, 12, 28 Pilocarpine is a cholinergic parasympathomimetic agonist that binds to muscarinic-M3 receptors of various exocrine glands for stimulation of secretory function. 13 According to the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug, its effect on saliva flow is dose-dependent and time-related, with a peak effect at 1 hour and a duration of 3-5 hours. 29 T Therefore, optimal benefit can be achieved with a four times daily dosing regimen. However, the cholinergic activity of this drug also contributes to its adverse effects in patients with SS, such as sweating, urinary frequency and flushing. 10, 12, 22 In fact, sweating is the most common drug-related adverse event (up to 43%) and could be a major reason for withdrawal from study. 12 But in general, these adverse events tend to decrease over time and might be diminished by starting with a low dose (e.g. 5 mg once or twice daily), and then increasing the dose gradually until the maintenance dose of 5 mg four times daily is achieved. 2, 23 Due to the high efficacy and safety, stimulation of saliva flow with a secretagogue is now considered to be the treatment of choice for symptomatic relief of the sicca syndrome and has become the most effective medication to prevent dental and oral complications in patients with SS. 2, 3, 10, 12 In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that pilocarpine 5 mg four times daily for 12 weeks is effective, safe and well tolerated for the relief of oral symptoms in patients with SS in Taiwan. The most frequent adverse event was sweating, but it did not increase the treatment withdrawal rate.",
