            "text": "PAP-1 (5-(4-phenoxybutoxy)psoralen), a potent small-molecule blocker of the voltage-gated potassium Kv1.3 channel, is currently in pre-clinical development for psoriasis. The present study was undertaken to identify the major phase-I metabolites of PAP-1 in rats. Following oral administration at 50 mg/kg, bile, plasma, urine and feces were collected, and separated by reversed-phase HPLC after sample preparation by solid-phase extraction. Five phase-I metabolites, i.e., 5-(oxybutyric-acid)psoralen (M1), 5-[4-(4-hydroxybutoxy)]psoralen (M2), 5-[4-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)]psoralen (M3), 5-[4-(3-hydroxyphenoxy)]psoralen (M4), 8-hydroxyl-5-(4phenoxybutoxy)psoralen (M5), were isolated and identified by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. M3, M4 and M5 were hydroxylated products, while M1 and M2 were Odealkylation products. Incubation of PAP-1 with rat liver microsomes rendered the same five major metabolites in a NADPH-dependent manner suggesting that cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are involved in PAP-1 metabolism. Inhibitors of rat CYP1A1/2 (alpha-naphthoflavone) and CYP3A (ketoconazole) but not CYP2D6, CYP2E or CYP2C9 blocked the metabolism of PAP-1 in rat microsomes. Of the five metabolites M3, M4 and M5 were found to inhibit Kv1.3 currents with nanomolar IC 50 s, while M1 and M2 were inactive. Our results identified the Kv1.3inactive M1 as the major phase-I metabolite, and suggest that hydroxylation and O-dealkylation are the major pathways of PAP-1 metabolism principally via CYP1A1/2 and CYP3A. We further conducted a 6-months repeat-dose toxicity study with PAP-1 at 50 mg/kg in both male and female rats and did not observe any changes in hematology, blood chemistry, body weight, histology of any major organ, or speeding up of metabolism suggesting induction of its metabolizing enzymes (presumably CYPs).",

During T cell activation both channels play an important role in regulating membrane potential by promoting a countercurrent efflux of potassium to allow influx of extracellular calcium through calcium release-activated calcium channels (Chandy et al., 2004; Cahalan and Chandy, 2009 ). Blockade of Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 consequently leads to membrane depolarization, thus reducing Ca 2+ influx and resulting in the prevention of T-cell activation (Chandy et al., 2004) .",

The Kv1.3-blocking peptides kaliotoxin (from scorpion venom), ShK (from the sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus), and its more selective derivative ShK(L5) have been shown to prevent and reverse the symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Beeton et al., 2001a (Beeton et al., , 2001b (Beeton et al., , 2005 and pristane induced arthritis (Beeton et al., 2006) . However, from the point of clinical application, small molecular blockers of Kv1.3 for oral administration would be highly desirable. Currently, the most potent and selective available small molecule Kv1.3 blocker is PAP-1 (5-(4-phenoxybutoxy)psoralen), which blocks the channel with an IC 50 of approximately 2 nM and exhibits 23-fold selectivity over Kv1.5 and 33-to 125-fold selectivity other Kv1-family channels, respectively . PAP-1 has been demonstrated to suppress delayed-type hypersensitivity , prevent type-1 diabetes development in autoimmune diabetes prone rats (Beeton et al., 2006) and to inhibit oxazolone-induced allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), a simple rat model of psoriasis (Azam et al., 2007) . Based on the fact that PAP-1 suppressed ACD not only after intraperitoneal and oral administration but also following topical application, the compound is currently in pre-clinical development for the treatment of psoriasis. Moreover, PAP-1 did not display any signs of acute toxicity in vitro or in vivo and did not prevent the development of flu vaccine responses in primates Pereira et al., 2007) .",

In particular it is not clear whether the potentially \"toxicophoric\" psoralen group of PAP-1 exhibits toxicity in vivo. In addition to possibly exhibiting phototoxicity, which has already been demonstrated to not be the case for PAP-1 , the metabolites resulting from initial oxidative metabolism of the furan ring of the psoralen moiety are also potentially toxic and have been shown to be suicide inhibitors of CYP (cytochrome P450) 1A1 and CYP2B1 for some psoralens Trager, 1998a, 1998b; Baumgart et al., 2005) . This is because the furan ring, an important site of metabolic alteration in psoralen derivatives such as 8-methoxypsoralen and 5-methoxypsoralen, can generate an extremely reactive carbonyl via an epoxide. This metabolite is then capable of binding covalently to macromolecules including the metabolizing P450 enzyme and has been suggested to be responsible for the carcinogenicity, mutagenicity and hepatotoxicity observed for some psoralens (da Silva et al., 2009) . To gain deeper insight into PAP-1's metabolic fate, we examined the biotransformation of the compound after oral administration to rats. Our preliminary experiments identified more metabolites in bile than in other matrixes such as plasma, urine or feces. The aims of this study were undertaken to 1) isolate and identify major phase-I metabolites of PAP-1 in rat's plasma, urine, feces and particularly in bile; 2) test identified metabolites of PAP-1 on kv1.3 activity; and 3) postulate the metabolic pathways of PAP-1 based on ex vivo and in vitro liver micorsome incubation results.",

The SPE procedures were briefly described below. Rat bile samples were thawed in a water bath at room temperature and then centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 minutes. 15 ml aliquots of the resultant supernatant were loaded onto LC-18 cartridges (3 ml/500 mg, SUPELCO, Bellefonte, PA, USA) previously conditioned with 6 ml of methanol and 6 ml of deionized water. Fractions (F-1, F-2, and F-3) were collected after elution with 2 ml of 10%, 50%, and 80% methanol, respectively. The first eluant fraction (F-1) samples were combined, acidified to pH 2.0 with 0.1 M HCl and then applied to a second LC-18 cartridge, which was subsequently washed with 2 ml of 40% methanol prior to elution of the final fraction (F-4) with 2 ml of 60% methanol. F-2 was discarded and both F-3 and F-4 were dried under N 2 at 50 \u00b0C, redissolved in methanol and separated by HPLC. The eluants corresponding to each metabolite were collected and combined, then evaporated to dryness and subjected to LCMS-IT-TOF and 1 H-NMR analysis.",

Following incubation of PAP-1 (10 \u03bcM) with liver microsomes (quadruplicates) we determined the concentrations of the five metabolites (M1 -M5) and plotted them as percentage of corresponding control (area under peak). The CYP1A1/2 inhibitor alpha-naphthoflavone (10 -100 \u03bcM) concentrationdependently decreased productions of M1 (with maximum inhibition of 92%), M4 (90%), M2 (60%) and M5 (48%), respectively but not M3 (Fig. 5A) , while the CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole (0.5 -100 \u03bcM) also concentration-dependently decreased productions of M1 (96%), M2 (82%), M3 (69%) and M5 (83%), respectively but not M4 (Fig. 5B ). On the other hand, the CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine (1 -50 \u03bcM), the CYP2E inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamate (1 -50 \u03bcM) and the CYP2C9 inhibitor sulphaphenazole (5 -100 \u03bcM) failed to significantly affect the metabolism of PAP-1 (Fig. 5C -5E ). These results suggest that CYP1A1/2 and CYP3A but not CYP2D6, CYP2E or CYP2C9 are principally involved in hydroxylation and O-dealkylation of PAP-1.",

            "text": "Previous studies demonstrate a relatively low bioavailability (10 -20%) for PAP-1 in rats after oral administration although PAP-1 showed good absorption through the gastrointestinal tract in rhesus macaques Pereira et al., 2007) and is predicted by QikProp\u00ae software to have an oral availability of 100% in humans. The observed low bioavailability of PAP-1 in rats was presumed to be mainly due to a large hepatic first-pass effect. When PAP-1 was orally administered to rats, PAP-1 and five phase-I metabolites (M1-M5) were structurally identified from bile. M1 was a carboxylic acid metabolite, while M2, M3, M4 and M5 were hydroxylated metabolites. While the metabolite M1 was reported in a previous study as an intermediate in the synthesis of \u03b1-methylene-\u03b3butyrolactone-psoralen (Ropp et al., 2004) , the other four metabolites identified here are new chemical entities, i.e., 5-[4-(4-hydroxybutoxy)]psoralen (M2), 5-[4-(4hydroxyphenoxy)]psoralen (M3), 5-[4-(3-hydroxyphenoxy)]psoralen (M4) and 8hydroxyl-5-(4-phenoxybutoxy)psoralen (M5). 5-Methoxypsoralen (a.k.a. bergapten) and 8-methoxypsoralen (a.k.a. xanthotoxin), two compounds used for photo-therapy of psoriasis and naturally occurring in Rutacea plants such as citrus, are metabolized in rats by hydrolysis of the lactone ring and oxidation of the furan ring (Mays et al., 1986; John et al., 1992) . Other studies further suggested that epoxidation of the furan ring of psoralens generated reactive intermediates responsible for the toxicity of psoralen compounds such as inactivation of CYP 2B1 and 2A6 Trager, 1998a, 1998b; Caffieri, 2002) . In contrast, PAP-1 maintained its intact psoralen structure during biotransformation based on the present study, and the major metabolite M1 was a polar carboxylic acid, which facilitated excretion without further metabolism, suggesting that PAP-1 should exhibit much less toxicity than other psoralen. In keeping with this suggestion, long-term administration of PAP-1 did not induce any changes in plasma liver enzymes and or liver histopathology. Since the psoralen core stayed intact during metabolism we thought it likely that several of the metabolites might still be active Kv1.3 blockers. In keeping with the SAR of phenoxyalkoxypsoralen-type Kv1.3 blockers and the recently published binding-site model of PAP-1 (Zimin et al., 2010) , the O-dealkylated M1 and M2 were found to be inactive. This observation was not surprising since the phenoxybutoxy side-chain of PAP-1 inserts into the lipophilic interphase between transmembrane segments S5 and S6 and the lack of the phenyl ring as well as the polarity of the carboxylic acid function of M1 would disrupt these hydrophobic interactions. The hydroxylated metabolites M3, M4 and M5 in contrast exhibited nanomolar potencies. The finding that the para-substituted M3 (IC 50 7 nM) was more potent than the meta-substituted M4 (IC 50 140 nM) was again confirmatory of the previously studied SAR of PAP-1 derivatives substituted on the side-chain phenyl ring .",

No 5hydroxypsoralen from dealkylation of the complete side-chain was detected in any samples. These results suggest that following absorption from the intestine PAP-1 was metabolized extensively in the liver, followed by two possible routes: 1) the five metabolites M1 -M5 were excreted across the canalicular membrane into bile; and 2) M1 was transported across the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes into the circulation. We hypothesize that the metabolites in the bile were excreted into the duodenum and most of M1 was reabsorbed later on. This is due to the facts that M1 was present in the mesenteric venous blood in high concentrations (similar to the bile) but little in feces, and that no M1 was detected following the incubation of PAP-1 with intestinal microsomes (data not shown). After effective absorption into the systemic circulation, M1 was predominantly eliminated by the kidneys. The other metabolites (M2 -M5) in contrasts do not seem to have been reabsorbed in the intestine and were directly excreted through feces because they were not detectable in plasma from the mesenteric vein but appeared in large amounts in the feces. Based on these observations we propose that M1 is the major circulating metabolite of PAP-1 and its biological activity as well as toxicity should be a focus for further study although it was demonstrated to be ineffective on Kv1.3 and therefore likely devoid of any immunosuppressive activity. In addition, all five metabolites with hydroxyl groups may go through phase-II conjugation reactions with glucuronic acid or sulfuric acid. The significantly higher concentrations of M3, M4 and M5 in feces than in bile suggest that they were likely released from the hydrolysis of phase-II metabolites. The fact that the Kv1.3active metabolites M3, M4 and M5 could not be detected in plasma further suggests that they do not contribute to the immunosuppressive activity of PAP-1.",

After incubation of PAP-1 in rat liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH, five metabolites were observed, in contrast to the negative results in the control incubations without NADPH, indicating the formation of these metabolites was enzymatic and NADPH-dependent. The in vitro metabolites were the same five metabolites that we had found in bile following in vivo metabolism. Furthermore, M2 was converted to M1 in microsomal incubations, while both M3 and M4 were transformed to M2 and M1, suggesting that O-dealkylation is the major metabolic reaction of PAP-1 in the liver. Neither M2 nor M1 were detected in M5 incubations, confirming what we had observed during the NMR experiments, namely that the hydroxyl group of M5 was not located on the side-chain phenyl ring as in M3 and M4, but instead on the psoralen ring system. M1 and M2 could be formed from PAP-1, M3 and M4 through O-dealkylation and formation of the corresponding aldehydes that were immediately reduced to the alcohol M2 or oxidized to the acid M1. Thus hydroxylation and O-dealkylation would be the major metabolic pathways of PAP-1, and O-dealkylation would probably be the major pathway for inactivation of PAP-1 on Kv1.3, as shown in Fig. 7 .",

The involvements of CYP1A1/2 and CYP3A in O-dealkylation were also demonstrated by application of alpha-naphthoflavone and ketoconazole (Monostory et al., 2003; Baririan et al., 2006) . In addition, the formation of mono-hydroxylated PAP-1 analogs was also inhibited by these two inhibitors while the CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine, the CYP2E inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamate and the CYP2C9 inhibitor sulphaphenazole up to 50 or 100 \u03bcM did not affect either O-dealkylation or hydroxylation of PAP-1. These results suggest that CYP1A1/2 and CYP3A appear to be the major CYP450 isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of PAP-1 via aromatic O-dealkylation and hydroxylation, which are also presented in Fig. 7 .
