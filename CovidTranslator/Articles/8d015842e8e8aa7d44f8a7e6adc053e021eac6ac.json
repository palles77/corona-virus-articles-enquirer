            "text": "There has been considerable recent interest into the causes and mechanisms of exacerbations of COPD, as COPD exacerbations are an important cause of the considerable morbidity and mortality found in COPD. 1 COPD exacerbations increase with increasing severity of COPD. Some patients are prone to frequent exacerbations that are an important cause of hospital admission and readmission and these frequent exacerbations may have considerable impact on quality of life and activities of daily living. 2 COPD exacerbations are also associated with considerable physiological deterioration and increased airway inflammatory changes 3 that are caused by a variety of factors such as viruses, bacteria and possibly common pollutants ( Fig. 68.1) . COPD exacerbations are more common in the winter months and there may be important interactions between cold temperatures and exacerbations caused by viruses or pollutants. 4 Earlier descriptions of COPD exacerbations have concentrated mainly on studies of hospital admission, though most COPD exacerbations are treated in the community and not associated with hospital admission. A cohort of moderate to severe COPD patients was followed in East London, UK (East London COPD Study) with daily diary cards and peak flow readings. The patients were asked to report exacerbations as soon as possible after symptomatic onset. 2 The diagnosis of COPD exacerbation was based on criteria modified from those described by Anthonisen and colleagues, 5 that require two symptoms for diagnosis, one of which must be a major symptom of increased dyspnea, sputum volume or sputum purulence. Minor exacerbation symptoms included cough, wheeze, sore throat, nasal discharge or fever (Table 68 .1). The study found that about 50% of exacerbations were unreported to the research team, despite the considerable encouragement provided and only diagnosed from diary cards, though there were no differences in major symptoms or physiological parameters between reported and unreported exacerbations. 2 Patients with COPD are accustomed to frequent symptom changes and thus may tend to underreport exacerbations to physicians. These patients have high levels of anxiety and depression and may accept their situation. 6, 7 The tendency of patients to underreport exacerbations may explain the higher total rate of exacerbations at 2.7 per patient per year, which is higher than previously reported by Anthonisen and co-workers 5 at 1.1 per patient per year. However, in the latter study, exacerbations were unreported and diagnosed from patients' recall of symptoms.",

Quality of life scores measured using a validated disease-specific scale -the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)were significantly worse in all of its three component scores (symptoms, activities and impacts) in the frequent, compared with the infrequent exacerbators. This suggests that exacerbation frequency is an important determinant of health status in COPD and is thus one of the important outcome measures in COPD. Factors predictive of frequent exacerbations included daily cough and sputum and frequent exacerbations in the previous year. A previous study of acute infective exacerbations of chronic bronchitis found that one of the factors predicting exacerbation was also the number in the previous year, 8 though this study was limited to exacerbations presenting with purulent sputum and no physiological data were available during the study.",

            "text": "In a further prospective analysis of 504 exacerbations, where daily monitoring was performed, there was some deterioration in symptoms, though no significant peak flow changes. 9 Falls in peak flow and FEV 1 at exacerbation were generally small and not useful in predicting exacerbations, but larger falls in peak flow were associated with symptoms of dyspnea, presence of colds and related to longer recovery time from exacerbations. Symptoms of dyspnea, common colds, sore throat and cough increased significantly during the prodromal phase and this suggests that respiratory viruses may have early effects at exacerbations. The median time to recovery of peak flow was 6 days and 7 days for symptoms, but at 35 days peak flow had returned to normal in only 75% of exacerbations, while at 91 days, 7.1% of exacerbations had not returned to baseline lung function. Recovery was longer in the presence of increased dyspnea or symptoms of a common cold at exacerbation. The changes observed in lung function at exacerbation were smaller than those observed at asthmatic exacerbations, though the average duration of an asthmatic exacerbation was longer at 9.6 days. 10, 11 The reasons for the incomplete recovery of symptoms and lung function are not clear, but may involve inadequate treatment or persistence of the causative agent. The incomplete physiological recovery after an exacerbation could contribute to the decline in lung function with time in patients with COPD. However to date there is no evidence that patients with incomplete recovery of their exacerbation have a greater decline in lung function and further studies on the natural history of COPD exacerbations are required. The association of the symptoms of increased dyspnea and of the common cold at exacerbation with a prolonged recovery suggests that viral infections may lead to more prolonged exacerbations. As colds are associated with longer exacerbations, COPD patients who develop a cold may be prone to more severe exacerbations and should be considered for therapy early at onset of symptoms.",

However the technique of sputum induction allows study of these patients at exacerbation and it has been shown that it is a safe and well-tolerated technique in COPD patients. 13 Levels of inflammatory cytokines have been shown to be elevated in induced sputum in COPD patients when stable, though changes at exacerbation had not been previously studied. 14 In a prospectively followed cohort of patients from the East London COPD Study, inflammatory markers in induced sputum were related to symptoms and physiological parameters both at baseline and at exacerbation. 3 There was a relation between exacerbation frequency and sputum cytokines, in that there was increased sputum IL-6 and IL-8 found in patients at baseline when stable with frequent exacerbations, compared with those with infrequent exacerbations ( Fig. 68.2) , although there was no relation between cytokines and baseline lung function. Sputum cell counts were not increased at baseline in patients with more frequent exacerbations suggesting that the increased cytokine production comes from the bronchial epithelium in COPD. As discussed below, exacerbations are triggered by viral infections, especially by rhinovirus that is the cause of the common cold. Rhinovirus has been shown to increase cytokine production in an epithelial cell line 15 and thus repeated viral infection may lead to up-regulation of cytokine airway expression.",

            "text": "At exacerbation, increases were found in induced sputum interleukin (IL)-6 levels and the levels of IL-6 were higher when exacerbations were associated with symptoms of the common cold ( Fig. 68.3) . Experimental rhinovirus infection has been shown to increase sputum IL-6 in normal subjects and asthmatics. [16] [17] [18] However, rises in cell counts and IL-8 were more variable with exacerbation and not reaching statistical significance, suggesting marked heterogeneity in the degree of the inflammatory response at exacerbation. The exacerbation IL-8 levels were related to sputum neutrophil and total cell counts, indicating that neutrophil recruitment is the major source of airway IL-8 at exacerbation. Lower airway IL-8 has been shown to increase with experimental rhinovirus infection in normal and asthmatic patients in some studies, 17 but not in others. 18 However, COPD patients already have up-regulated airway IL-8 levels when stable due to their high sputum neutrophil load 14 and further increases in IL-8 would be unlikely. COPD exacerbations are associated with a less pronounced airway inflammatory response than asthmatic exacerbations, 19 and this may explain the relatively reduced response to steroids seen at exacerbation in COPD patients, relative to asthma. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] In the study performed by Bhowmik and colleagues, 3 there was no increase seen in the eosinophil count at exacerbation, even though the patients in that study were sampled early at exacerbation with onset of symptoms. Compared with the study by Saetta and colleagues, 12 where patients had mild COPD, the patients had more severe and irreversible airflow obstruction with an FEV 1 at 39% predicted. Thus it is possible that the inflammatory response at exacerbation is different in nature in patients with moderate to severe COPD than in patients with milder COPD.",

            "text": "COPD exacerbations have been associated with a number of etiological factors, including infection and pollution episodes ( Table 68. 2). COPD exacerbations are frequently triggered by upper respiratory tract infections and these are more common in the winter months, when there are more respiratory viral infections in the community. Patients may also be more prone to exacerbations in the winter months, as lung function in COPD patients shows small but significant falls with reduction in outdoor temperature during the winter months. 4 COPD patients have been found to have increased hospital admissions, suggesting increased exacerbation when increasing environmental pollution occurs. During the December 1991 pollution episode in the UK, COPD mortality was increased together with an increase in hospital admission in elderly COPD patients. 27 However, common pollutants especially oxides of nitrogen and particulates may interact with viral infection to precipitate exacerbation rather than acting alone. 28 viruses, especially rhinovirus (the cause of the common cold) can be detected by polymerase chain reaction from a large number of these exacerbations. 29 Rhinovirus has not hitherto been considered to be of much significance during exacerbations of COPD. In a study of 44 chronic bronchitics over 2 years, Stott and colleagues 30 found rhinovirus in 13 (14.9%) of 87 exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. In a more detailed study of 25 chronic bronchitics with 116 exacerbations over 4 years, Gump et al. 31 found that only 3.4% of exacerbations could be attributed to rhinoviruses. In a more recent study of 35 episodes of COPD exacerbation using serological methods and nasal samples for viral culture, little evidence was found for a rhinovirus etiology of COPD exacerbation. 32 Two recent studies showed that at least one-third of COPD exacerbations was associated with viral infections, and that the majority of these were due to rhinovirus. 33, 34 Viral exacerbations were associated with symptomatic colds and prolonged recovery. 9 However Seemungal and colleagues 34 showed that rhinovirus can be recovered from induced sputum more frequently than from nasal aspirates at exacerbation, suggesting that wild-type rhinovirus can infect the lower airway and contribute to inflammatory changes at exacerbation. They also found that exacerbations associated with the presence of rhinovirus in induced sputum had larger increases in airway IL-6 levels, 34 suggesting that viruses increase the severity of airway inflammation at exacerbation. This finding is in agreement with the data that respiratory viruses produce longer and more severe exacerbations and have a major impact on health care utilization. 9, 33 Other viruses may trigger COPD exacerbation, though coronavirus was associated with only a small proportion of asthmatic exacerbations and is unlikely to play a major role in COPD. 29, 35 Bacterial colonization Airway bacterial colonization has been found in approximately 30% of COPD patients, and this colonization has been shown to be related to the degree of airflow obstruction and current cigarette smoking status. 36 Although bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been associated with COPD exacerbation, some studies have shown increasing bacterial counts during exacerbation, while others have not confirmed these findings. 37 , 38 Soler and colleagues 39 showed that the presence of potentially pathogenic organisms in bronchoalveolar lavage from COPD patients at bronchoscopy was associated with a greater degree of neutrophilia and higher TNF-a levels. Hill and colleagues 40 in a larger study showed that the airway bacterial load was related to inflammatory markers. They also found that the bacterial species was related to the degree of inflammation, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization showing greater myeloperoxidase activity (an indirect measure of neutrophil activation).",

In patients with moderate and severe COPD, the mechanical performance of the respiratory muscles is reduced. The airflow obstruction leads to hyperinflation, with the respiratory muscles acting at a mechanical disadvantage and generating reduced inspiratory pressures. The load on the respiratory muscles is also increased in patients with airflow obstruction by the presence of intrinsic positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP). With an exacerbation of COPD, the increase in airflow obstruction will further increase the load on the respiratory muscles and increase the work of breathing, precipitating respiratory failure in more severe cases. The minute ventilation may be normal, but the respiratory pattern will be irregular with increased frequency and decreased tidal volume. The resultant hypercapnia and acidosis will then reduce inspiratory muscle function, contributing to further deterioration of the respiratory failure.",

In patients with stable COPD, symptomatic benefit can be obtained with bronchodilator therapy in COPD, even without significant changes in spirometry. This is probably due to a reduction in dynamic hyperinflation that is characteristic of COPD and hence leads to a decrease in the sensation of dyspnea especially during exertion. 41 In stable COPD, greater bronchodilatation has been demonstrated with anti-cholinergic agents than with b 2 -agonists, which may be due to the excessive cholinergic neuronal bronchoconstrictor tone. 42 However, studies investigating bronchodilator responses in acute exacerbations of COPD have shown no differences between agents used and no significant additive effect of the combination therapy, even though the combination of an anticholinergic and bronchodilator has benefits in the stable state. 43, 44 This difference in effect between the acute and stable states may be due to the fact that the larger doses of drug delivered in the acute setting produce maximal bronchodilatation, whereas the smaller doses administered in the stable condition may be having a submaximal effect. Methylxanthines, such as theophylline, are sometimes used in the management of acute exacerbations of COPD. There is some evidence that theophyllines are useful in COPD, though the main limiting factor is the frequency of toxic side-effects. The therapeutic action of theophylline is thought to be due to its inhibition of phosphodiesterase which breaks down cyclic AMP, an intracellular messenger, thus facilitating bronchodilatation. However, studies of intravenous aminophylline therapy in acute exacerbations of COPD have shown no significant beneficial effect over and above conventional therapy. 45 There are some reports of beneficial effects of methylxanthines upon diaphragmatic and cardiac function, though these mechanisms require further study in patients with COPD exacerbations.",

In an early controlled trial in patients with COPD exacerbations and acute respiratory failure, Albert and co-workers 20 found that there were larger improvements in pre-and postbronchodilator FEV 1 when patients were treated for the first 3 days of the hospital admission with intravenous methylprednislone than those treated with placebo. Another trial found that a single dose of methylprednisolone given within 30 minutes of arrival in the accident and emergency department produced no improvement after 5 hours in spirometry, and also had no effect on hospital admission, though another study reduced readmission. 21, 22 A retrospective study of patients treated with steroids at exacerbation compared with those not treated showed that the steroid group had a reduced chance of relapse after therapy. 23 Thompson and colleagues 24 gave a 9-day course of prednisolone or placebo in a randomized manner to out-patients presenting with acute exacerbations of COPD. Unlike the previous studies, these patients were either recruited from out-patients or from a group that were pre-enrolled and selfreported the exacerbation to the study team. In this study, patients with exacerbations associated with acidosis or pneumonia were excluded, so exacerbations of moderate severity were generally included.

Exacerbations treated with steroids were more severe and associated with larger falls in peak flow rate. The treated exacerbations also had a longer recovery time to baseline for symptoms and peak flow rate. However, the rate of peak flow rate recovery was faster in the prednisolone-treated group, though not the rate of symptom score recovery. An interesting finding in this study was that steroids significantly prolonged the median time from the day of onset of the initial exacerbation to the next exacerbation from 60 days in the group not treated with prednisolone, to 84 days in the patients treated with prednisolone. In contrast, antibiotic therapy had no effect on the time to the next exacerbation. If short course oral steroid therapy at exacerbation does prolong the time to the next exacerbation, then this could be an important way to reduce exacerbation frequency in COPD patients, which is an important determinant of health status. 2 Davies and colleagues 25 studied patients admitted to hospital with COPD exacerbations who were randomized to prednisolone or placebo. In the prednisolone group, the FEV 1 rose faster until day 5, when a plateau was observed in the steroid-treated group. Changes in the pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator FEV 1 were similar suggesting that this is not just an effect on bronchomotor tone, but involves faster resolution of airway inflammatory changes or airway wall edema with exacerbation. Length of hospital stay analysis showed that patients treated with prednisolone had a significantly shorter length of stay. Six weeks later, there were no differences in spirometry between the patient groups and health status was similar to that measured at 5 days after admission. Thus the benefits of steroid therapy at exacerbation are most obvious in the early course of the exacerbation. A similar proportion of the patients, approximately 32% in both study groups required further treatment for exacerbations within 6 weeks of follow-up, emphasizing the high exacerbation frequency in these patients.",

A UK study showed that with the use of NIPPV in exacerbations of respiratory failure, earlier correction of pH can be achieved, together with reduction in breathlessness over the initial 3 days of ventilation, compared with a control standard therapy group. 53 A study from the USA showed a significant reduction in intubation rates with NIPPV from 67% in a group receiving conventional therapy to 9% in the NIPPV group. 55 A third study showed convincingly that in patients with exacerbations of respiratory failure, the use of NIPPV with pressure support ventilation, reduces the need for intubation and mortality was significantly reduced from 29% in the conventionally treated group to 9% in the NIPPV group. 54 Complications, which were specifically associated with the use of mechanical ventilation, were also reduced. The difference in mortality disappeared after adjustment for intubation, suggesting that the benefits with NIPPV are due to fewer patients requiring intubation.This was also the first study to show that hospital length of stay can be reduced with use of NIPPV. A recent study showed that NIPPV can be applied on general wards, though patients with more severe acidosis had a worse outcome. 56 These studies have treated patients where the pH was below 7.35, rather than just below 7.26, when the prognosis of COPD worsens. A number of these patients may have improved without NIPPV, though it seems that the major effect of NIPPV is the earlier correction of acidosis and thus avoidance of tracheal intubation, with all its associated complications. Studies have shown that NIPPV can be successfully implemented in up to 80% of cases. 57,58 NIPPV is less successful in patients who have worse blood gases at baseline before ventilation, are underweight, have a higher incidence of pneumonia, have a greater level of neurological deterioration and where compliance with the ventilation is poor. 57 Moretti and colleagues 59 have recently shown that \"late treatment failure\" (after an initial 48 hours of therapy with NIPPV) is up to 20% and that patients with late failure were more likely to have severe functional and clinical disease with more complications at the time of admission.

However, the overall exacerbation frequency was relatively low in that study and this was probably due to a retrospective assessment of exacerbation. 65 Another earlier study suggested that the severity of exacerbations may be reduced with inhaled steroid therapy. 66 An observational study showed that exacerbations were increased following withdrawal of inhaled steroids, though this study was not placebocontrolled. 67 Two recent studies have also shown that small reductions in exacerbations can be achieved with bronchodilator therapy, though both studies involved relatively short periods of therapy at 12 weeks. 68, 69 Mahler and colleagues 68 found that the time to the first exacerbation was longer with therapy with the long-acting beta-agonist, salmeterol, though the overall number of exacerbations during the study was relatively small. Van Noord and colleagues 69 in a similar study suggested that the combination of salmeterol and ipratropium was most effective in reduction of exacerbation. Longer-term studies of the effects of bronchodilators on COPD exacerbation are now required.",

More specific written treatment plans for COPD patients at risk may be useful, as are produced for asthmatics, though such an approach requires formal testing. Following an exacerbation, the COPD patient's condition should be reviewed and attention given to risk factors and compliance with therapy. Strategies to reduce exacerbation frequency need to be urgently developed.We will then be in a better position to reduce significantly the morbidity associated with COPD exacerbation and improve the health-related quality of life of our patients in this disabling condition.",
