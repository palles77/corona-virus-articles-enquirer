Methods: The HPS was positioned at 45\u00b0on the bed and programmed to mimic mild lung injury (oxygen consumption, 300 mL/min; lung compliance, 35 mL/cm H 2 O). Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke for visualization. Inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) started at 10 cm H 2 O and gradually increased to 18 cm H 2 O, whereas expiratory pressure was maintained at 4 cm H 2 O. A leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light sheet, and images were captured by high definition video. Normalized exhaled air concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by the smoke particles. Findings: As IPAP increased from 10 to 18 cm H 2 O, the exhaled air of a low normalized concentration through the ComfortFull 2 mask (Respironics) increased from 0.65 to 0.85 m at a direction perpendicular to the head of the HPS along the median sagittal plane. When the IPAP of 10 cm H 2 O was applied via the Image 3 mask (Respironics) connected to the whisper swivel, the exhaled air dispersed to 0.95 m toward the end of the bed along the median sagittal plane, whereas higher IPAP resulted in wider spread of a higher concentration of smoke. Conclusions: Substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs within a 1-m region, from patients receiving NPPV via the ComfortFull 2 mask and the Image 3 mask, with more diffuse leakage from the latter, especially at higher IPAP.",

The continued circulation of the H5N1 virus in migratory birds and the widespread occurrence of the H5N1 avian influenza infection in poultry and birds in several continents have increa-sed the risk of human exposure to avian influenza. 2 Respiratory failure is the major complication in and multiorgan failure, requiring intensive care support. [2] [3] [4] Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) may play a limited supportive role for early ARDS/acute lung injury as a bridge to invasive mechanical ventilation in an influenza pandemic, although it is contraindicated in critically ill patients with multiorgan failure and hemodynamic instability. 5, 6 However, as influenza virus may be contained in fine particles generated during tidal breathing, 7 the application of NPPV may further disperse potentially infected aerosols and contribute to nosocomial transmission of influenza. We have previously reported 8 that exhaled air particles could be dispersed up to a radial distance of 0.5 m from patients receiving NPPV using the Ultra Mirage mask (ResMed; Bella Vista, NSW, Australia). This current study aimed to examine the directions and dispersion distances of exhaled air during application of NPPV via other commonly used face masks. Knowledge about the directions and extent of exhaled air leakage in different masks is essential for the development of preventive measures to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission during application of NPPV to these high risk patients in an influenza pandemic.",

The HPS represented a 70-kg adult man sitting on a 45\u00b0inclined hospital bed. It was programmed to breathe spontaneously to mimic mild lung injury. The lung compliance was set as 35 mL/cm H 2 O, and the oxygen consumption was set as 300 mL/min. Tidal volume and respiratory rate were regulated so that a respiratory exchange ratio of 0.8 was maintained during measurements. Typically, this was achieved with a tidal volume of 300 mL and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min. 13, 14 The HPS contains a realistic airway and a lung model that undergoes gas exchange by removing oxygen and adding carbon dioxide to the system simultaneously.

In this regard, the deliberate leakage via the exhalation ports may generate droplet nuclei and disperse infective aerosols through evaporation of water content of respiratory droplets and resulting in a superspreading event. 23 Nonetheless, NPPV has been applied to a small number of human H5N1 infections without causing any nosocomial outbreak, although the patients eventually died of multiorgan failure despite invasive mechanical ventilatory support. 24, 25 There were also anecdotal reports 26,27 that NPPV applied using a single circuit was effective in treating respiratory failure due to SARS and might reduce the need for intubation.

The Whisper Swivel is an efficient exhalation device to prevent carbon dioxide rebreathing, but it would not be advisable to use such an exhalation port in managing patients with febrile respiratory illness of unknown etiology, especially in the setting of an influenza pandemic with high human-to-human transmission potential for fear of causing major nosocomial infection. It is also important to avoid the use of higher IPAP, which could lead to wider distribution of exhaled air and substantial room contamination as demonstrated in this study. The World Health Organization interim guidelines on the prevention and control of acute respiratory diseases in health care has included NPPV among those aerosol-generating procedures in which there is a possibility of an increased risk of respiratory pathogen transmission. In addition to maintaining contact, droplet, and standard precautions among the health-care workers when providing routine care to such patients, the World Health Organization recommends 31 full personal protection equipment for the health-care workers covering the torso, arms, eyes, nose, and mouth, and this should include a long-sleeved gown, single-use gloves, eye protection, and a N95 mask or the equivalent as the minimum level of respiratory protection. NPPV should be provided in an adequately ventilated single room, and the addition of an expiratory port with a bacterial/viral filter can reduce aerosol emission. 31 Our study was limited by the use of smoke particles as markers for exhaled air. The inertia and weight of larger droplets in an air droplet two-phase flow would certainly cause them to have less horizontal dispersion than the continuous air carrier phase in which they travel due to increased inertia and drag. However, the evaporation of water content in some droplets during NPPV may produce droplet nuclei suspended in air, whereas the larger droplets will fall to the ground in a trajectory pathway. 25 As the smoke particles in this study mark the continuous air phase, our data contours are referring to exhaled air. Our results would therefore represent the \"upper bound\" estimates for the dispersion of droplets, which would be expected to follow a shorter trajectory than the air jet due to gravitational effects but not fully reflect the risk of droplet transmis-sion. 8,10 -12 Similarly, we would expect a higher concentration of droplets closer to the floor than that estimated by our contours because of the shorter trajectory of the droplets.",
