            "text": "High rates of head and neck cancer, particularly oral cavity and oropharynx carcinomas, in the Middle East are due to smoking and chewing tobacco. In a recent epidemiologic report, the prevalence of tobacco smoking in the Middle East and North Africa in male patients over the age of 15 years varies from a low of 15% in Oman to a high of 77% in Yemen, with most other countries in the 30% to 60% range. 8 Female patients were noted to have one-tenth the rate of smoking compared with men. The authors, using established predictions, project that the number of estimated new cases of oral and oropharynx cancers in this region, especially in Egypt, Iran, and Turkey, could double by the year 2030, 4 times the predicted incidence worldwide. A swell in the aging population in these countries (ie, living longer) may be a factor. 9 Reducing high-risk factors such as smoking and use of smokeless tobacco (shammah and qat), and perhaps exploring or mitigating the risks for human papilloma virus Workforce Considerations, Training, and Diseases infections, could be effective public health methods to address this projected increase in cancer incidence. 10 In a report of the Middle East Cancer Consortium (MECC), thyroid cancer contributes 1.5% to 3.80% of all cancers diagnosed annually in the 4 MECC countries studied (Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, and Jordan). 11 Female patients in the regions were found to have twice the incidence of thyroid cancers compared with male patients. Agestandardized incidence rates across the countries ranged from 2.0 in Egypt to 7.5 in Israeli Jews. Egypt, in particular, has a very high incidence of anaplastic thyroid cancer (14%) compared with the other MECC countries and the United States (<3%). Egypt also showed the lowest rate of differentiated thyroid carcinomas (73%) than the other 3 MECC countries studied (90%-94%). 11 The MECC report also addressed laryngeal carcinomas in the 4 countries studied. Age-standardized incidence rates for laryngeal carcinoma in Israeli Jews, Jordanians, and Egyptians were found to be commensurate with the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program rates. However, the rate in Israeli Arab male patients (6.0) was higher than comparable US SEER male patients (4.6). 12 The incidence of laryngeal cancer in female patients in the studied populations was quite low. Because alcohol consumption is considered to be minimal in predominately Muslim Middle Eastern countries, the epidemiologic preventative focus is being placed on reducing smoking in the at-risk populations.",

During World War I, the Ottoman Empire entered the conflict on the side of the Central Powers: Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. As the war concluded, several European powers maintained colonial empires, even as the Ottoman Empire dissolved. Much can be written about the ethics of empire and governance of people and cultures by outside powers, though that is beyond the scope of this article. One product of European influence in the Middle East was the Sykes-Picot Agreement. 13 In this agreement, the Triple Entente (England, France, and Russia) agreed to separate spheres of influence within what was then called Asia-Minor, without significant consideration of local cultures and populations. The resulting English mandate would govern much of modern Iraq, Jordan, and modern Israel, whereas the French mandate would govern northern Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and eastern Turkey. The national boundaries later established in the region largely ignored cultural, tribal, and sectarian affiliations, setting the stage for much of the conflict resulting in this region in the subsequent century.",

With increasing American influence in the region following World War II, there has been a growing acceptance of the American medical educational model as well. As countries in the region sought to speed modernization, many made university education available at low or no cost. Because of the prestige of a medical degree, there is considerable familial and societal pressure for students to select medicine, which is an undergraduate course of study in the British system (A. Atef, personal communication, 2017). Resulting rates of medical degree holders range widely from 0.311 per 1000 population in Yemen to 3.62 per 1000 in Israel. This compares with 2.55 in the US and 2.48 in Canada. 14 Although several countries within the region boast impressive Graduate Medical Education opportunities, countries may lack a coordinated national health policy that aligns undergraduate and graduate medical education. 15 Therefore, many trainees elect to receive training outside the region. This is true of otolaryngology, as it is for other medical and surgical specialties. As early as 1994, articles appeared encouraging an increase in graduate-level otolaryngology training within the Arab world. 16 One limitation to surgical training is inherited traditions that prohibit cadaveric dissection (A. Atef, personal communication, 2017). In recent years, simulation has been used to bridge this gap. 17 Another confounding issue with practice is that no single standard for credentialing exists. Whereas many countries recognize the Arab Boards, many recognize local boards, PhD degrees, and certifying examinations from Europe, England, or America.",

Although this affords trainees a wealth of training opportunity, demand for otolaryngology services far outstrips the supply available in many communities. In such situations, regional academic otolaryngology faculty members often care for the flood of patients with extremely advanced disease. Faculty members working in these centers are forced to be creative to meet specific surgical challenges and system demands. In recent years, both armed conflict and political change following the Arab Spring uprising have increased challenges to providing effective graduate and continuing medical education in many Middle Eastern Countries. Not only has funding for medical centers and faculty been threatened and inconsistent but also, for a time, outside speakers were reluctant to participate in regional conferences because of personal security concerns. Tightening borders in Europe and the United States increases challenges to otolaryngologists who would otherwise attend conferences in these regions. Especially needed in the Middle East are more female otolaryngologists, reflective of the general requirement for female physicians across the world but especially in the male-dominant Middle East medical profession; however, advances are being made to better reflect Western gender balances in specialty training.",

            "text": "The challenges for health care delivery in Middle Eastern countries are many, varied, and complex. Chronic diseases are on the increase and there is a high burden of disease, especially with pulmonary infections, head and neck cancers, and trauma, for which assistance from international organizations and professionals is needed. It must be emphasized, however, that even in the face of constant strife and conflict and very limited resources in some countries, the dedication of health care providers is exemplary. These professionals, including otolaryngologist surgeons, care for patients under often dangerous conditions and continue to do so in the face of their own potential peril. This dedication is worthy of praise and recognition.",
