The Automated and Real-time Bioaerosol Sampler based on Wet-cyclone (ARBSW) continuously collects bioaerosols in a liquid medium and delivers the samples to a sensing device using a wireless remote control system. Based on a high air-to-liquid-flow-rate ratio (\u223c 1.4 \u00d7 10 5 ) and a stable liquid thin film within a wet-cyclone, the system achieved excellent sampling performance as indicated by the high concentration and viability of bioaerosols (> 95% collection efficiency for > 0.5-\u03bcm-diameter particles, > 95% biological collection efficiency for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus). Furthermore, the continuous and real-time sampling performance of the ARBSW system under test-bed conditions and during a field test demonstrated that the ARBSW is capable of continuously monitoring bioaerosols in real time with high sensitivity. Therefore, the ARBSW shows promise for continuous real-time monitoring of bioaerosols and will facilitate the management of bioaerosol-related health and environmental issues.",

            "text": "Concerns over airborne microorganisms, called bioaerosols, have increased due to their adverse effects on the human body and the environment [1] [2] [3] [4] . Bioaerosols, such as pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and fungal spores, are associated with infectious diseases, allergies, and asthma [2, [5] [6] [7] . For example, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses, which have recently killed hundreds of people in East Asia, are transmitted by direct inhalation of contaminated bioaerosols [8] . Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the bioaerosol concentration within indoor air be less than 500 CFU/m 3 air [9, 10] . A technique enabling rapid real-time detection of airborne microorganisms would be advantageous for public health research and bioterrorism defense; however, the development of such a system is at an early stage. A major reason for the slow pace of development is the difficulty of determining the concentration and type of bioaerosols in the air stream [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Bioaerosols are typically detected by first collecting them in a liquid or on a surface and analyzing the collected particles using culture-based techniques, biochemical assays (e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [14, [17] [18] [19] [20] . Recently, the development of real-time detection systems for microorganisms in liquid medium has made considerable progress [14, [21] [22] [23] ; however, the performance of bioaerosol sampling systems with regard to biological stability, particle collection efficiency, and particle enrichment is still insufficient for use as a real-time system. In addition, integration of the bioaerosol sampling system and the detection system, including rapid and stable sample transfer, would be desirable for continuous real-time monitoring of bioaerosols.",

Tan et al. developed an automated electrostatic sampler that involves collection of bioaerosols in a liquid reservoir and their delivery to sensing devices [24] . Liu et al. and other researchers described an airborne pathogen direct analysis system based on microfluidic enrichment [11] [12] [13] ; however, these systems require prolonged sampling for enrichment. A novel bioaerosol sampling system, the MicroSampler, based on two-phase fluid control in a microchip can be used with a real-time bioaerosol sensor [25] ; however, due to the low throughput, adequate sampling is difficult in the presence of bioaerosol concentrations < 500 CFU/m 3 air . A wet-cyclone collects aerosols into a liquid film on the inner wall of the cyclone using the particle centrifugal force and the liquid surface tension. Such systems achieve high sampling performance and enable the concentration of samples due to the high flow rate ratio between the incoming air and drainage liquid. Considerable research has focused on the development of wet-cyclone bioaerosol samplers [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] ; however, these have a large particle cut-off diameter, and a low particle collection efficiency and aerosol-to-liquid transfer rate; furthermore, the twophase flow operation is unstable and few fully integrated bioaerosol sampling systems are capable of continuous real-time sampling.",

In addition, the ARBSW was subjected to sampling sensitivity tests of bioaerosol detection under test-bed conditions, as well as real-time bioaerosol monitoring in a real atmosphere environment.

            "text": "For evaluating the bioaerosol collection efficiency of the ARBSW, the number concentrations of the test bioaerosols before and after transmission through the ARBSW system were measured using an APS. Simultaneously, the drainage liquid was sampled (\u223c 100 \u03bcL) and the colony number was determined using the colony counting assay. Finally, the culturable bioaerosol number concentration (CFU/mL) was determined according to the total liquid volume. The BioSampler (SKC Inc., Eighty Four, PA, USA) was used for performance evaluation in terms of the relative microbial recovery (%) and sample enrichment ratio of bioaerosol. The BioSampler was formed of glass and consisted of three parts: an inlet, a nozzle section with three tangential sonic nozzles and a collection vessel. The collection vessel was filled with a liquid collection medium (20 mL). The nozzles of the BioSampler create a swirling air flow (12.5 L/min air of air supply) that maintains microorganism viability by gently moving particles onto the collection surface without re-aerosolization [25, [37] [38] [39] . Under the same bioaerosol exposure condition (\u223c 100 particles/cm 3 air of total aerosol number concentration (TANC)), we sampled the bioaerosols using the ARBSW and BioSampler and obtained the culturable bioaerosol number concentration, respectively. Finally, we compared the relative microbial recovery (%) and the sample enrichment ratio between the ARBSW and BioSampler under various sampling times. Figure S2 shows a schematic diagram of the sensitivity test setup to evaluate the real-time sampling responsivity of the ARBSW under the abrupt bioaerosol exposure conditions. The S. epidermidis suspension was nebulized for 40 s at 10-min intervals in a biosafety cabinet. While the ARBSW system samples surrounding bioaerosols in a real-time manner, the APS monitors the change of TANC at 1-min intervals. The real-time colony concentration of sampled particles using ARBSW was determined using the colony counting assays and compared with the real-time data of APS. Figure S3 shows a schematic diagram of the real-world field test setup. The temperature, relative humidity and wind speed were monitored using a hot-wire anemometer with thermohygrometer (TES-1341; TES Electrical Electronic Corp., Taipei, Taiwan). The atmospheric particulate matter (PM) concentration and TANC were monitored using an optical particle counter (OPC) (model 1.109; GRIMM Aerosol Technik Ainring GmbH & Co. KG, Ainring, Germany). The ARBSW also sampled the atmospheric bioaerosols continuously and the liquid samples were stored every 5 min. These samples were tested using colony counting assays to obtain the bioaerosol colony concentration. Fig. 1(a) shows the aerosol collection principle of the wet-cyclone module for the ARBSW system. The cyclone is a conical device that creates an internal helical air stream and collects aerosols on the inner wall through centrifugal force. In our wet-cyclone module, a stable liquid thin film is formed on the inner wall of the cyclone by centrifugal force and the shear force generated by the high air-flow rate. At the same time, the liquid film slowly and continuously flows down the cyclone according to the balance between the supply and drainage liquid flow for delivering samples. Due to the large difference between the air and liquid flow rates, aerosols entering the wet-cyclone are completely collected in the liquid film, rapidly concentrated to a high enrichment ratio and continuously delivered to an analytical sensor. Our bioaerosol sampling system has a cut-off diameter of 0.3 \u03bcm and collection efficiency of > 99% for aerosols > 1 \u03bcm in diameter with high-throughput operation. The cut-off diameter (d 50 ), defined as the diameter of the aerosol having a collection efficiency of 50%, is expressed as follows [40] :",

The stable liquid film means that the liquid covers the entire surface of the cyclone wall without being sprayed out of the film, to prevent sampling loss in the cyclone. The drag force of the fluid on the particle is proportional to the cube of the particle size, whereas the force between the particle and the wall is proportional to the particle size. Therefore, if fine aerosols directly adhere to the cyclone wall, there is no way to remove the particles, resulting in sampling loss [41] .

When We m increases the inertia of the liquid due to the shear force generated at the interface between the liquid film, the air flow overwhelms the surface tension of the film surface and the liquid is separated from the surface and sprayed into the surrounding air stream. To maintain a stable liquid film the We m should be lowered by adjusting the air flow rate and the liquid flow rate. However, reducing the air flow rate to lower We m hampers particle concentration and decreases the collection efficiency of fine aerosols (see Eq. (1)).

The volume-of-fluid (VOF) model, a two-phase flow model in Fluent code, was developed to calculate the hydrodynamics of liquid film formation inside the cyclone under various operating conditions. For the reasons mentioned above, the air flow rate was set at > 12 L/min and the liquid drainage flow rate was limited to 12 mL/h to attain an enrichment ratio of > 10 4 . Within the cyclone the surface of the thin liquid film rapidly evaporates due to the high air flow rate; therefore, if the liquid supply flow rate was lower than or equal to the drainage flow rate, a stable liquid film would not be formed and the liquid would split into multiple streams ( Fig. 2(a) (i); supplied liquid flow rate (Q s ) = 9 mL/h, drainage liquid flow rate (Q d ) = 10 mL/h). In contrast, if the supply flow rate were larger than the drainage flow rate, the liquid would float inside the cyclone and tend to clog (Fig. 2(a)(iii) ; Q s = 9 mL/h, Q d = 5 mL/h). The optimal supply and drainage flow rate ratio is around 1.1 (Fig. 2(a) (ii); Q s = 9 mL/h, Q d = 8.2 mL/h).",

A comparative test was conducted with the conventional verified bioaerosol sampler, called BioSampler, which has a collection efficiency of > 90% for bioaerosol sizes of > 0.5 \u03bcm and a microbial recovery of > 99%.

Fig. 6(b) shows the TANC and colony concentration of the bioaerosols at 1-min intervals during the test.

Fig. 7(b) shows the variations in atmospheric PM and total culturable bioaerosol concentrations during the field test (details of the experimental setup are in Fig. S3 ). PM 10 and PM 2.5 are defined as the mass fractions (\u03bcg/m 3 air ) of aerosols with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 and 2.5 \u03bcm, respectively [40] . The PM 10 concentration decreased from 13 to 10 \u03bcg/m 3 air and the PM 2.5 decreased from 11 to 9 \u03bcg/m 3 air . During the field test, the TANC also decreased from \u223c 5.5 \u00d7 10 5 to \u223c 3.7 \u00d7 10 5 particles/m 3 air at a particle size range > 1.0 \u03bcm (\u02dc33% reduction) (Fig. S6) , similar to the trends of PM concentrations (Fig. 7(b) ). The total bioaerosol concentration monitored by the ARBSW decreased from 220 to 180 CFU/ m 3 air at a rate similar to those of PM 10 and PM 2.5 . These results indicate that the bioaerosol concentration was influenced predominantly by the PM concentration. More environmental monitoring data are shown in the supporting information (Fig. S6) . These results demonstrate that the ARBSW system can perform continuous and real-time bioaerosol monitoring in real-world environments. ",

This system has superior particle collection and particle transfer efficiency into a liquid medium. Compared with a conventional bioaerosol sampler, the ARBSW system enables marked particle enrichment and stable microbial recovery. Furthermore, the ARBSW not only has an excellent sampling performance with rapid responsivity, but is also suitable for the real-time monitoring of bioaerosols in real-world environments. The continuous liquid-based particle sampling used by the ARBSW system, when integrated with a real-time particle analysis system (e.g., microfluidic flow cytometer), enables continuous quantitative characterization of airborne microorganisms and facilitates analysis of the physicochemical and biological properties of bioaerosols, for example using markers for specific aptamers or antibodies.",
