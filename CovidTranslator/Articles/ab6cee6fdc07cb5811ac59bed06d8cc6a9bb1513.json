For centuries, extracts from natural products have been a main source of folk medicines, and even today, many cultures still employ them directly for medicinal purposes. Among the classes of identified natural products, triterpenoids, one of the largest families, have been studied intensively for their diverse structures and variety of biological activities. As a continued study of naturally occurring drug candidates, this review describes the research progress over the last three years (2006-2008) on triterpenoids possessing cytotoxic or anti-HIV activity, with focus on the occurrence, biological activities, and structure-activity relationships of selected compounds and their synthetic derivatives.",

            "text": "Betulinic acid (1) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene belonging to the lupane family. It is present in many terrestrial plant species, e.g., Ancistrocladus heyneanus, Diospyros leucomelas, Syzygium formosanum, Tetracera boliviana, Tryphyllum peltatum, and Ziziphus vulgaris. [1] [2] [3] Compound 1 can also be obtained in quantity from the bark of the London plane tree, Platanus acerifolia. 4, 5 Trumbull and co-workers 6 identified the inhibitory activities of compound 1 against tumor promotion in 1976. Later, its action was identified as a melanoma-specific cytotoxicity mediated by the induction of apoptosis. 7 The cytotoxicity as well as mechanism of action of 1 have been reviewed. [8] [9] [10] [11] Although it was initially identified as a melanoma-specific cytotoxic agent, in more recent studies, 1 showed antiproliferative activity against MCF-7 cells (GI 50 : 0.27 \u00b5M), 12 as well as neuroblastoma (SKNAS), rhabdomyosarcomamedulloblastoma (TE671), breast carcinoma (T47D), lung carcinoma (A549), colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29), multiple myeloma (RPMI8226), cervical carcinoma (HPCC), and glioblastoma multiforme (HPGBM) cell lines (IC 50 : 2.4-4.5 \u00b5M). 13 It also showed broadspectrum cytotoxicity towards lung, colorectal, breast, prostate, and cervical cancer cell lines, 14 as well as drug-resistant colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (SNU-C5/WT, SNU-C5/5FU-R, and SNU-C5/OXT-R). 15 Compound 1 induces apoptosis 11, 16 through the mitochondrial pathway. 15, 17, 18 A typical decrease in bcl-2 and cyclin D1 gene expression and increase in bax gene expression was observed in several cancer cell lines treated with 1, 13, 19 which agreed with prior literature. 18 Subsequent studies on its anticancer mechanism revealed that 1 is a potent activator of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome. 20 In addition, 1 decreases expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the antiapoptotic protein survivin in prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) by activating selective proteasome-dependent degradation of the transcription factor's specificity proteins. 21 Compound 1 also inhibits NF-B expression in androgen-refractory human prostate cancer cells (PC-3), which exhibit high constitutive NF-B expression. 19 Furthermore, although 1 reportedly is an inhibitor of human topoisomerases (topo) I and II , 22, 23 it does not show synergistic effects with other topo-I inhibitors. In contrast, 1 inhibited the formation of topo-I DNA cleavable complexes (apoptotic mediatora) induced by camptothecin, staurosporine, and etoposide in prostate cancer cells. 24 This study also indicated that the tumor death mediated by 1 can be counteracted by the mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) inhibitor U0126 in melanoma cells. 25 Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of 1 have led to the preparation of numerous C-3 hydroxyl, C-20 double bond, C-28 carboxylic acid, and miscellaneous modified analogues. In most cases, C-3 modification led to altered cytotoxic potency and selectivity, while reduction of the C-20-C-29 double bond and replacement of the C-28 carboxyl group with ester and amide side chains generally gave derivatives inactive against cancer cell lines. 9 Recent approaches revealed similar results. Compound 2, the C-3 epimer of 1, demonstrated decreased cytotoxicity when compared with 1. 56 Betulinic C-3 esters 3 and 4 exhibited better activity against KB cells. 57 3-O-Glycosidated derivatives 5 and 6 were 8-to 12-fold more potent than 1 (IC 50 : 2.6-3.9 \u00b5M) against cancer cells and showed better selectivity compared with healthy cells (IC 50 : 31 \u00b5M). 58 The C-28 monosaccharide derivatives (7) showed slightly increased cytotoxicity, whereas trisaccharide analogues (8) were inactive. 59 In anti-HIV studies, adding a C-28 side chain was a successful structure modification strategy; however, the resulting potent anti-HIV lead 9 (IC9564) lost the ability to activate chymotrypsin-proteasomal activity compared with 1. 20 2-Cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) is a promising anticancer synthetic oleanolic acid analogue (see Section 2.2), and this same CDDO modification concept (incorporating a 2-substituted-1-en-3-one A-ring in the triterpenoid skeleton) was also applied to 1. The resulting A-ring-modified 2-substituted-1-en-3-one derivatives (10-Compound 1 has also been evaluated for additional biological activities. It reduces the activity of cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT-1 and ACAT-2) 48 and the formation of triglyceride (TG) by inhibiting diacylglycerol acyltransferase in human HepG2 cells. 31 When studied for cardiovascular activity, 1 demonstrated up-regulation of eNOS and downregulation of NADPHoxidase in human endothelial cells. 65 The proinflammatory effect of 1 was proved by blocking the interaction of C1q with antibodies in the classical pathway. 66 Moreover, 1 displayed anti-inflammatory activity through the suppression of both NO and PGE2 generation by macrophages, with IC 50 values of 0.7 and 0.6 \u00b5M, respectively. 67 Compound 1 is also a competitive inhibitor of the protease (3CL) of SARS-CoV, a highly virulent coronavirus, with a K i value of 8.2 \u00b5M. 68 In other experiments, 1 and various C-3 modified analogues showed antimicrobial activity, with inhibitory effects toward Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC: 10-109 \u00b5M), 30, 69 Trichophyton soudanense (MIC: 54.8 \u00b5M), and T. mentagrophytes (MIC: 27.4 \u00b5M). 70 Compound 1 also inhibited the invasion of Porphyromomas falciparum into erythrocytes, with IC 50 values of 13.8 \u00b5M, 71 and blocked the binding effects of heat-labile entero-toxin (LT) of E. coli in intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in the suppression of LT-induced diarrhea. 72 Lupeol (24), a very common lupane-triterpene widely distributed in the plant kingdom, occurs across a multitude of taxonomically diverse genera and geographical areas. In a survey of the Chemical Abstracts database, more than 100 literature references during the period 2006 to 2008 reported the occurrence of lupeol. A recently published review described the chemopreventive prospects, molecular target, and mechanism of action of 24. 73 In an earlier investigation of apoptotic induction and cell arrest in various cancer cells, further molecular-level phenomena involving MAPK, PI3K/Akt, death receptor, and NF-B signaling pathways were also revealed. 73 The following in vitro and in vivo studies showed similar results; 24 inhibited the growth of LNCaP cells (IC 50 : 75 \u00b5M) and significantly reduced testosterone-induced prostate changes in mice by a factor of 1.4. 74 Compound 24 arrested the cell cycle at the G(1)-S phase in PC-3 cells 75 or the G2/M phase in 451Lu cells and 451Lu xenografts in nude mice. 76 In addition, 24 caused induction of capase-3, and elevation of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio in LNCaP, PC-3 and 451Lu cells were observed, which are characteristics of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. [74] [75] [76] Interestingly, pre-treatment or posttreatment with 24 at a dose of 200 mg/mouse showed 56% and 43% preventive effects, respectively, against DMBA-induced DNA breakage. 77 ",

            "text": "The relative potency of BAs, proposed mechanisms of action, and molecular targets, including non-redox-type 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), platelet 12-lipoxygenase (p12-LO), human leukocytes elastase (HLE), cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP 2C8/2C9/3A4), topoisomerases I and IIa, and NF-B kinase (IKK /b), have been reviewed. 83, 85 An inhibitory effect on cycloxygenase-1 (COX-1) by 38 was also identified. 86 These targets are indicative of the anti-inflammatory (5-LOX, p12-LO, HLE, and COX-1) and anticancer (topo I/IIa and IKK / ) activities of the BAs. Compound 38, which is commonly known as AKBA (3-O-acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid), has been the most well explored BA. A recent discovery revealed that 38 showed moderate to low toxicity against human skin-derived normal cell lines. 87 However, 38 induced apoptosis in PC-3 and LNCaP cells through a death receptor (DR-5)-mediated pathway, which is a signal transduction cascade involving the activation of capase-8 and capase-3 in apoptosis. 88 The inhibitory effect of 38 was significant in comparison with those of indomethacin and cyclophosphamide against bFGF-induced angiogenesis using an in vivo matrigel plug assay. 89 Two C-3 acetylated BA derivatives, 36 and 40, showed almost comparable activity with cisplatin against neuroblastoma (NB-39 and SK-N-SH) cell lines. 80 Compound 40 triggered apoptosis by activation of caspase-3 and induction of DNA fragmentation in PC-3 cells and PC-3 xenotransplants in chick chorioallantoic membrane. 90 Compound 36 showed similar inhibitory effects to those of -carotene, reported as 380 and 397 molar ratios, respectively, to 32 pM TPA used as inhibitor, in the TPA-mediated EBV-EA activation assay. 80 In several anti-inflammatory studies, treatment with BAs from B. serrata diminished chemical-or stress-induced edema, arthritis, and gastric ulcer, with moderate to low activity. 91, 92 Compound 38 demonstrated a synergistic effect in combination with indomethacin on kainic acid-induced excitotoxicity and oxidative damage in vitro, 87, 93 and with glucosamine for the treatment of murine edema and arthritis. 94 In anti-inflammatory and other assays, -BAs generally show greater potency than -BAs. In contrast, 3-O-acetyl--boswellic acid (A BA, 40) was the most potent analogue (IC 50 : 1-3 \u00b5M) compared with -derivatives against purified topo I. 83 The cytotoxic SAR of BAs has seldom been addressed, but in recent studies, 40 showed higher cytotoxic activity than 39, indicating the importance of a C-3 acetyl group for optimal potency of -BAs. 80 Furthermore, 4-amino -BA analogues (41) (42) (43) displayed enhanced cytotoxicity compared with the corresponding -BAs possessing a 4-carboxylic acid, while C-3 -epimers of these amino analogues (44) did not show improved activity. 95 A CDDO-like (see Section 2.2) analogue (45) showed enhanced activity against A-549, A-431, HL-60, MCF-7, T47D, and HT1080 cell lines, with sub-micromolar EC 50 values (EC 50 : 0.10-0.59 \u00b5M). 96 Ursolic acid (3 -hydroxy-urs-12-en-28-oic acid (46) is a prevalent pentacyclic triterpenoid carboxylic acid. It has been found in various plants in both aglycone and glycoside forms, and traditional uses of plants containing 46 in folk medicine are abundant. Modern studies have shown that 46 possesses many biological activities, such as anti-oxidative, antiinflammatory, antitumor, and hepato-protective activity. The diverse inflammatory effects of 46 were reviewed by Ikeda et al. in 2008. 97 This review also summarized the inhibitory activity of 46 on cancer cells, which may be due to suppression of inhibitors of the NF-B pathway and p65 phosphorylation, thereby causing down-regulation of the expression of downstream oncogenes. Compound 46 may also reduce skin tumor formation by inhibiting the binding of carcinogen to epidermal DNA or cell membrane. Furthermore, 46 induces cell differentiation and apoptosis in certain cancer cell lines. For details, see the review by Ikeda et al. 97 Current work has provided more evidence on the bioactivity of 46. Inhibitory effects were observed on both the PI3K-Akt and MAPK P44/42 pathways, which are associated with cell apoptosis in endometrial cancer cell lines (SNG-II and HEC108). 98 Compound 46 exhibited chemopreventive effects during the cancer initiation phase of an in vivo inhibitory assay of aberrant crypt foci (ACF), which are putative precursors of colon cancer, and increased neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) activity. 99 Compound 46 also inhibited endogenous reverse transcriptase (RT), an enzyme involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation, in melanoma (A375) and anaplastic carcinoma (ARO) cell lines. Downregulation of the expression of two cancer-related genes, c-myc and cyclin-D1, in A375 and/ or ARO cells was stimulated by 46. 100 In contrast, 46 reduced the amount of L1210 cell growth inhibition induced by doxorubicin. The result might be due to scavenging of ROS involved in the apoptotic processes induced by doxorubicin. 101 A similar inhibitory pattern was observed on H 2 O 2 -induced DNA breakage in HL-60 cell lines treated with 46. 102 In other SAR studies, compounds with an acetyl moiety on the C-3 hydroxy group (47) showed greater potency than those with a free hydroxyl. 103 In addition, the CDDO modification strategy was applied. The C-2 cyano or trifluoromethyl derivatives of 1-en-3one-ursolic acid (48 and 49) showed better activity than C-2 iodo-and non-substituted analogues (50 and 51) in anti-proliferation assays using KU7, 253JB-V, Panc-1, and Panc-28 cancer cell lines (IC 50 : 0.17-1.13 \u00b5M). 104 The bioactivities of other naturally occurring ursane-triterpenes have also been reported. Topical application of asiatic acid (52) resulted in a significant reduction in skin tumor formation induced by TPA, and TPA-induced [ 3 H]thymidine incorporation was lessened. Concurrently, 52 inhibited the TPA-induced generation of NO and expression of iNOS and COX-2, which are important factors in tumor promotion. 105 In addition, 52 induced apoptosis in PPC-1 and U-87MG cancer cells. The apoptotic phenomena included early activation of caspase-2, \u22123, and \u22128 in PPC-1 cells 111 and caspase-9 and \u22123 in U-87MG cells. 112 Intracellular release of Ca 2+ was observed in both cell lines, and U-87MG cell death was alleviated by BAPTA/AM, an intracellular Ca 2+ inhibitor. These results implied that the cell death is attributable to Ca 2+ -mediated necrotic apoptosis. 106 Two new ursane-type triterpenes, microfokienoxane C (53) and 3 ,28-dihydroxy-11methoxyurs-12-ene (54), were isolated from the leaves of Microtropis fokienensis. Glycyrrhizin (55) and its aglycone, glycyrrhetic acid (56, GA), are abundant constituents of licorice (most familiarly the species Glycyrrhiza glabra). The aglycone 56 exists as 18 -and 18b-isomers, and 18b-GA was more effective than 18 -GA in inhibiting the mutagenicity induced by various mutagens. 108 A recent review on the pharmacological effects of Glycyrrhiza sp. described the broad-spectrum of bioactivities of 55 and 56, including antiinflammatory, antiviral, hepatoprotective, antitumor, and immunomodulatory. 109 For details about prior studies on antitumor activities of 55 and 56, see the reviews by Wang and Nixon 108 and Asl et al. 109 Although several studies have found that GA demonstrates cytotoxic or apoptotic activity, most of the results have shown only moderate or low potency. Thus, investigation has focused more on the preparation of active derivatives and chemosensitizing activity. Two 56 analogues, 57 and 58, which possess a C-3 alkoxyimino group and a C-29 carboxylic acid or methyl ester, showed slightly stronger antiproliferative and apoptotic activities than 56. The GI 50 value improved from 63 \u00b5M to 19 \u00b5M against HL-60 cells. However, the C-29 free acid (58) is important, because the methyl ester analogue (57) was less potent in the apoptosis assay. 110 The application of 2-cyano-1-ene-3-one (CDDO) modification on GA was successful, as methyl 2-cyano-3,11-dioxo-18 -olean-1,12-dien-30-oate (59, -CDODA-Me) was active against HL-60 cells at a sub-micromolar concentration (EC 50 : 0.93 \u00b5M). 96 Another study reported that 59 and the 2-trifluoromethyl derivative (60) were more cytotoxic against KU7 (IC 50 : 0.38-1.59 \u00b5M), Panc-1 (IC 50 : 0.82-1.22 \u00b5M), Panc-28 (IC 50 : 1.14-1.80 \u00b5M), and 253JB-V cells (IC 50 : 0.25-0.67 \u00b5M) compared to 56. The relative potencies of 59 and 60 were dependent on cell line. 111 A mechanism study on 59 revealed that its potent antitumor activity may be due to differential induction of two tumor-suppressor genes, Kr\u00fcppel-like factor-4 (KLF-4) and caveolin-1, in colon cancer cells. 112 Subsequent pro-apoptotic responses were also induced through activation of kinases ATF3, NAG-1, and p21 or through kinase-independent inhibition of AR and PSA, resulting in the growth inhibition of LNCaP cells. 113 Compound 56 showed chemosensitizing effects with various clinical oncology drugs; it enhanced the sensitivity of vinblastine against KB-C2 cells and doxorubicin against KB/MRP cells. In addition, 56 partly reversed multidrug resistance in P-gp-expressing cells (KB-C2) or multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1)-expressing cells (KB/MRP), by increasing the intracellular accumulation of the antitumor drugs. 114 In an interesting study, chemical conjugates of 56 and paclitaxel were synthesized. However, although the conjugated compounds (61) showed better activity than 56, they were still less potent than paclitaxel itself. 115 Based on these findings, it is likely that glycyrrhetic acid analogues elicit antitumor activity through multiple pathways.",

            "text": "Oleanolic acid (62, OA), a well known triterpene occurring in numerous varieties of plants, possesses many biological properties, including anti-inflammatory, trypanocidal, anti-HIV, and cytotoxic activities. 116 In 1988, OA was reported to suppress TPA-induced tumor promotion. 117 Synthetic A-ring modified OA analogues with improved cytotoxicity were pursued, and 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (63, CDDO) as well as its C-28 methyl ester, CDDO-Me (64, RTA402), were designed and synthesized by Honda et al. in 1998. Both of these synthetic derivatives strongly inhibited the production of NO induced by IFN-in mouse macrophages (IC 50 : 0.4 nM). 118 Further derivatization of CDDO to yield imidazolides (65, CDDO-Im), amides (66 and 67), or a dinitrile (68, Di-CDDO), significantly increased the anti-NO activity. Among these derivatives, CDDO-Im (65), was 100 times more potent than CDDO, with an IC 50 value of 1 pM. 119 In addition to the strong anti-inflammatory activity, CDDO derivatives were reported to exhibit other bioactivities, including cytoprotection, cancer cell growth inhibition, and apoptosis induction. 120 Preliminary studies confirmed that OAs have the potential to become an important new treatment for multiple forms of cancer, and both 63 and 64 are currently in phase I clinical trials for the treatment of metastatic or unresectable solid tumors or lymphoma. The pharmacological effects induced by OA-related derivatives were summarized in very recent reviews by Liby et al., 120 Sogno et al. 121 and Sultana et al. 116 Xanifolia-Y (69) was isolated from Xanthoceras sorbifolia, and several hydrolyzed derivatives (70-72) were prepared. Glycoside 69, which has angeloyl groups on C-21 and C-22, was more cytotoxic (IC 50 : 2.63 \u00b5M) to OVCAR3 cells than either the non-esterified glucoside or the di-esterified aglycone (70 and 71, IC 50 : >120 \u00b5M and 14.2 \u00b5M, respectively). Thus, the ester moieties on C-21 and C-22 are required for the cytotoxicity, while hydrolysis of the trisaccharide slightly lowered activity. 122 Maslinic acid (73) , an oleanane triterpene identified from Crataegus oxyacantha in 1953, 123 was recently also isolated from apple peel along with the derivatives 74 and 75. All three compounds were evaluated for antitumor activity, and 74 together with 75 showed minor antiproliferative effects against HepG2 (EC 50 : 17.9-20.6 \u00b5M), MCF-7 (EC 50 : 20.9-29.2 \u00b5M), and Caco-2 (EC 50 : 8.9-14.2 \u00b5M), while 73 showed an effect only on the Caco-2 cell line (EC 50 : 15.4 \u00b5M). 124 Compound 73 was also isolated quantitatively from olive fruit, but showed only a weak anti-proliferative effect against the HT-29 cell line (EC 50 : 101.2 \u00b5M) without any necrotic effects. 125 25-Hydroxy-3-oxoolean-12-en-28-oic acid (76, amooranin) was isolated from the stem bark of Amoora rohituka. It was cytotoxic against the SW620 cell line (IC 50 : 6.2 \u00b5M) and delayed tumor growth rate in SW620 xenografts in nude mice. Concurrently, a microarray study of 76 showed that it caused down-regulation of VEGF and JUN genes, which are associated with angiogenesis and antiproliferation of cancer cells, respectively. 126 Capilliposide B (77), an epoxy-oleanane saponin isolated from Lysimachia capillipes, was cytotoxic against human A-2780 cells, with an IC 50 value of 0.08 \u00b5M. 127 In a semi-synthetic approach, 128 ",

            "text": "Ganoderic acid D (82) isolated from Ganoderma lucidum was assessed for anti-proliferation activity and showed an IC 50 value of 17.3 \u00b5m against human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa). Furthermore, the 82-treated HeLa cells were arrested at the G2/ M phase of the cell cycle with apoptosis. A simultaneous proteomic study led to the identification of 21 genes regulated by 82, while the 14-3-3 protein-related genes may play an important role for 82induced cytotoxicity. 131 Ganoderiol F (83) derived from Ganoderma amboinense, was found to inhibit proliferation of cancer cell lines, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562, IC 50 : 4 \u00b5m) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2 and Huh7, IC 50 : 17 \u00b5m and 8.5 \u00b5m, respectively). Activation of MAPK/ EKR and up-regulation of CDK inhibitor p16 were found in early stages of treatment with 83 and were presumed to cause cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase and trigger premature senescence of HepG2 cells. 132 Dehydrotrametenolic acid (84), a lanostane triterpene isolated from the sclerotium of Poria cocos, selectively inhibited H-ras-transformed J82 cells and induced apoptosis through the caspase-3 pathway. Cells treated with 84 were arrested at the G2/M phase and accumulated at the sub-G1 phase, with a high GI 50 value of 40 \u00b5m. Compound 84 also regulated the expression of H-Ras, Akt, and ERK, which are the downstream proteins of H-Ras signaling pathways. 133 In addition, a subsequent study of the same fungus yielded 12 lanostane triterpenes (85) (86) (87) (88) (89) (90) (91) (92) (93) (94) (95) (96) , which showed inhibitory effects in the EBV-EA activation assay in Raji cells. Compounds 90 and 96 also showed inhibitory effects in DMBA-and TPA-mediated in vivo murine skin tests. 134 Impatienside A (97) and bivittoside D (98), two lanostane-type triterpenes containing C-3 hexasaccharide moieties, were isolated from the sea cucumber Holothuria impatiens. The two glycosides exhibited in vitro cytotoxicity equal or slightly better than those of the clinical antitumor drug etoposide (VP-16) against seven different human tumor cells, including colon cancer (HCT-116 and HT-29), lung cancer (A549), hepatoma (HepG2), prostate cancer (DU145), breast cancer (MCF-7), and nasopharyngeal cancer (KB), with IC 50 values of 0.25-1.9 \u00b5m. 135 Cucurbitane-type triterpenes, isomers of lanostanes, constitute a group of diverse substances that are known for their bitterness and toxicity. They were isolated initially from Cucurbitaceae plants and were later found in other plant families. Besides cytotoxicity and anticancer activity, cucurbitacins also exhibit other wide ranging in vitro or in vivo pharmacological effects, such as purgative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fertility. However, these compounds have had only very limited usage due to their non-specific toxicity. The distribution, structure characterization, and bioactivities were reviewed by Chen et al. in 2005 . 136 More recent studies showed that cucurbitacin B (99) possessed weak inhibitory effects on laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (Hep-2, IC 50 : 39.06 \u00b5m), which may be due to the inhibition of STAT-3, a transcription activator in cell growth. 137 23,24-Dihydrocucurbitacin B (100), isolated from roots of Trichosanthes kirilowii, inhibited the proliferation of human breast cancer cells (Bcap37, IC 50 : 1.5 \u00b5m) and arrested the cell cycle at the G 2 /M phase. The antiproliferation activity was reduced by the caspase-family inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, suggesting a mitochondria-dependent pathway. 138 Cucurbitacins D (101) and J (102) elicited anti-proliferative effects on both hepatocellular carcinoma BEL-7402 cells (IC 50 : 1.41 and 1.37 \u00b5m, respectively) and malignant melanoma SK-MEL-28 cells (IC 50 : 1.22 and 1.28 \u00b5m, respectively). 27 ",

It enhanced the cytotoxic effects of TNF, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin, as well as the TNF-B pathway and NF-B-regulated gene products. 160 Further pharmacological study showed that 119 inhibited the activation of NF-B by blocking the phosphorylation and degradation of IkB kinase in the upstream NF-B signal transduction cascade. 151 Both 119 and gedunin (136) were found to inhibit HSP90 function by acting outside the ATP-binding pocket, which is similar to the action of the existing drugs cisplatin and novobiocin. 159, 161, 162 A concurrent study revealed that 119 suppressed the activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor-dependent gene expression in oral leukoplakia (MSK-Leuk1) cells, which implicates a chemopreventive effect. 163 Investigation of its anti-angiogenesis effect revealed that 119 suppressed angiogenesis by acting on the VEGF tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, but not VEGF itself. 164 Compound 119 also showed both in vitro and in vivo chymotrypsin-like proteasomal inhibitory activity toward purified proteasome (20S and 26S proteasome, IC 50 : 2.5-5 \u00b5m) in PC-3 or LNCaP cells, and inhibited PC-3 xenografted tumors in nude mice. 165 Subsequent SAR studies on semi-synthetic analogues of 119 concluded that the quinone methide moiety is important for cytotoxic activity. Dihydrocelastrol (120) and 6-oxopristimerol (121), derivatives with an aromatized quinone methide moiety, were inactive in both cytotoxicity 166 and anti-tubulin polymerization assays. 153 The C-29 free acid present in 119 is not required for its ability to induce apoptosis; C-29 ester or amide derivatives (122) showed an equal or lower potency in inhibiting the growth of human and mouse melanoma tumor cells. 166 Analogues that lack C-29, such as tingenone (123) and 22hydroxytingenone (124) , showed lower activity than 119 in in vitro tubulin polymerization inhibition and cytotoxicity assays against RPMI8226 cell lines. 153",

            "text": "Tetranortriterpenes (limonoids)-Triterpenoids belonging to the limonoid family occur as glucosides and aglycones in fruits of Rutaceae and Meliaceae plant families. They show putative antitumor properties, and have been sufficiently reviewed regarding their distribution, 167 biosynthetic pathway, 168, 169 and bioactivity. 170, 171 The latest study on the antiproliferative effects of three limonoids, limonin (125) , nomilin (126) and obacunone (127) , confirmed that, as either aglycones (125) (126) (127) or glycosides (128) (129) (130) , these compounds exert versatile action against neuroblastoma cancer cells (SH-SY5Y). They induced apoptosis, arrested the cancer cell cycle at the G1 phase, and showed an aneuploidic effect, which elevated the aneuploid numbers in treated cancer cells compared with untreated ones. Both aglycones and glucosides were toxic to the cells, but aglycones were less effective in causing rapid cell death. 172 3 ,7 -Dideacetylkhivorin (131) was isolated from Khaya senegalensis, and subsequent cytotoxic screening showed that it was active against SiHa (IC 50 : 0.11 \u00b5M), MCF-7 (IC 50 : 0.14 \u00b5M), and Caco-2 (IC 50 : 0.07 \u00b5M) cancer cell lines. 173 Nimbolide (132) Gedunin (135), a limonoid with antimalarial, insecticidal, and antitumor activities, was recently isolated from Xylocarpus granatum 176 and Cedrela sinensis. 177 It exerted weak antitumor activity against the CaCo-2 cell line, with an IC 50 value of 16.83 \u00b5M. 176 However, 135 and its derivatives 136-140 showed moderate cytotoxicity against P-388 murine leukemia cells, with IC 50 values ranging from 6.0-17.1 \u00b5M. In the same study, 141-143 exhibited very weak or no activity (IC 50 : >116 \u00b5M), suggesting that an oxygenated functionality at the 11 -position is critical. 177 Further modification at C-7 on 135 gave two active analogues with C-7 carbamate (144) and ketone (145) groups. These compounds demonstrated antiproliferative activity comparable to 135, and acted by modulating heat shock protein (Hsp90) in MCF-7 and SkBr3 cells. 178 Methyl angolensate (146), a natural tetranortriterpenoid derived from the root callus of Soymida febrifuga, 179 possessed low cytotoxic activity (IC 50 : 100.0 \u00b5M), but did induce apoptosis by triggering the intrinsic pathway. 180 Quassinoids-Quassinoids are bitter constituents and secondary metabolites exclusively of Simaroubaceous origin. They are regarded biogenetically as degraded triterpenoids. Quassinoids have diverse bioactivities including antifeedant, insecticidal, herbicidal, antiparasitic, antimalarial, and antitumor effects. 181 As early as the 1970s, reports ascribed a wide range of antitumor activity to bruceantin, a quassinoid triterpene, which elicited major interest in quassinoids as promising lead drugs. However, the complex chemical structures of quassinoids have limited their anticancer potential. For more details, see the review by Vieira et al. 181 6 -Tigloyloxychaparrinone (147) was isolated from Ailanthus integrifolia in 1978, 182 and its antitumor activities have been reported. 183, 184 More recent studies led to the isolation of 147 from A. altissima. It showed inhibitory effects on hypoxia-induced VEGF, erythropoietin expression, and the activation of HIF-1 , a transcription factor protein that promotes tumor cell adaptation and survival under hypoxic conditions. 185 Brusatol (148) showed cytotoxic activity against P-388 murine cancer cells, with an IC 50 value of 0.012 \u00b5M. The A-ring modified compounds 149 and 150 showed reduced activity, indicating that the C-2 enolic oxygen is essential for activity. The 11-ketone analogue 151 showed even weaker activity, indicating that a -hydroxy group at C-11 is also important. 188 In a chemosensitization study, 158 potentiated the cytotoxicity of the antitumor drugs colchicine, vinblastine, and paclitaxel against MDR nasopharyngeal cancer cell lines (KB-C2 and KB-V1), by inhibiting P-gp(ABCB1)-mediated drug efflux. 189 Jaspolide B (160), a novel isomalabaricane-type triterpene isolated from marine sponges, Jaspis spp, 190 exhibited cytotoxicity toward hepatoma (Bel-7402, IC 50 : 29.1 \u00b5M; HepG2, IC 50 : 29.5 \u00b5M) and human promyeloleukemic (HL-60, IC 50 : 0.78 \u00b5M) cell lines. 191, 192 Subsequent studies showed 160 induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in HL-60 at the G2/ M phase 191 and in Bel-7402 at the G1 phase. 192",

Systematic structural modifications were carried out on the C-3 hydroxyl, A-ring, C-19 isopropenyl group, and C-28 carboxyl moiety, which led to the discovery of many potent anti-HIV agents (Table  3) . 194, 195 The C-3 hydroxy group can be readily acylated with a wide variety of anhydrides and acid chlorides. Such modification resulted ultimately in the identification of bevirimat (3-O-3 ,3dimethylsuccinyl BA, 161), which displayed a significant anti-HIV EC 50 value of 0.35 nM. 196 The SAR study also showed that an ester functionality at C-3, an appropriate length of the C-3 side chain, a terminal carboxylic acid moiety, and dimethyl substitution at the C-3 position are critical for the enhanced antiviral potency of 161. Further SAR demonstrated that, within the 3 -dimethyl moiety, the 3 S-methyl contributed more towards the activity, because 3 S-monomethylsuccinyl-substituted BA (3 S-MSB, 162) and 161 showed similar antiviral potency (EC 50 : 8.7 and 1.3 nM, respectively), while 3 R-MSB (163) showed much reduced activity (EC 50 : 0.12 \u00b5M). 197 Mechanism of action studies revealed that 161 retained its nanomolar antiviral potency against HIV-1 isolates resistant to reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR) inhibitors. To define the target of 161 (bevirimat), scientists from Panacos Pharmaceuticals Inc. and the National Institutes of Health characterized the virus produced by cells treated with the compound. 198 The studies showed that 161 inhibited the processing of the viral Gag polyprotein at a specific step, the conversion of the capsid precursor p25 to mature capsid (CA) p24, in a dose-dependent manner. 198 The impaired cleavage of p25 to p24 led to the production of morphologically defective, non-infectious, immature viral particles (Fig. 2) . Therefore, 161 was designated as amaturation inhibitor (MI),a new class in the antiretroviral family. It is currently in Phase IIb clinical trials and will enter Phase III clinical trials in 2009.",

Neither saturation of the 20(29) double bond nor allylic substitution at C-30 through an ether or thioether linkage influenced the anti-HIV activity of the 1 derivatives significantly. 205 Further research demonstrated that the C-30 position serves as a good place to incorporate water-solubilizing moieties and to increase the hydrophilicity of this compound class. 205 Interestingly, as indicated, the anti-HIV-1 targets of triterpene analogues can vary depending on the side chain modification positions. C-28-modified analogues of 1 are potent HIV entry inhibitors, while C-3-modified derivatives function by blocking virus maturation. A combination of these two modifications led to the identification of A12-2 (166), a bifunctional HIV inhibitor that interferes with both viral entry and maturation. 202 Compounds 167 and 168, in which a secondary amine forms the C-28 amide bond, exhibited significantly increased metabolic stability in pooled human liver microsomes. 205 Compounds 166-168 showed very potent anti-HIV activity, which was slightly better than that of 161. Gerrish et al. synthesized another series of 3,28-disubstituted 1-analogues. 206 These compounds contained a dimethylsuccinyl ester side chain at C-3 and variously substituted benzyl and phenethyl amides at C-28. Several compounds in this series showed potent anti-HIV activity, and 169 and 170 showed the best pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties. 206 Generally, substitutions at the ortho-position of the benzyl or phenyl ring provided the best activity. The 3,28-dimodified derivatives may serve as attractive promising leads to develop a next generation of 1-derived HIV-1 inhibitors as clinical trials candidates.",

In order to further explore the antiviral activity, several different -and -amino acids (single, dipeptide, or tripeptide) were coupled at the C-28 position of 73 by using both solution-and solid-phase synthetic methods. However, only compounds 176 [with 11-aminoundecanoic acid (11AUA) at C-28] and 177 (with a C-28 conjugate dipeptide of 11AUA and L-valine) showed approximately 50% inhibition activity against virus replication at 10 \u00b5M. These derivatives showed no cytotoxicity, although 73 itself displayed both cytotoxic and antiviral activities. 209 Prior research on glycyrrhetic acid (56) and its synthetic derivatives mainly led to negative results. 210, 211 The modifications focused on substitutions of the C-3 hydroxy and C-30 carboxylic acid groups. Because the rigid triterpene scaffold determines the relative position of the functional side chains, the skeleton could be very important to the anti-HIV and other bioactivities. Therefore, the distance from the hydroxy group to the carboxylic moiety and the dihedral angles of the D/E rings were predicted using modeling software. The results provided a possible explanation for why analogues of 56 showed fewer anti-HIV effects than analogues of betulinic (1) or moronic acid (181) . 210, 211 A recent paper reported the synthesis and anti-HIV activity of a group of analogues of -Dglucosamine-conjugated glycyrrhetic acid (56) . 212 The glucosamine was linked to the 3hydroxy group through a spacer containing phthalic, maleic, or succinic acid residues. Although such modifications slightly increased the anti-HIV activity of 56, the antiviral potency of these derivatives remained only moderate. The most potent analogue 3-O-[3-(N-2-deoxy--D-glucopyranos-2-yl)-carbamoyl]-phthaloyl-11-deoxy-glycyrrhetic acid (178) had an anti-HIV EC 50 value of 2.0 \u00b5M. 212 The anti-HIV and other biological activities of oleanolic acid (62, OA) and its derivatives were reviewed by Sultana et al. in 2007. 116 Basically, OA was identified as an anti-HIV principle, because it inhibited HIV-1 replication with an EC 50 value of 3.7 \u00b5M and a therapeutic index (TI) of 12.8. 213 Modification of OA at the C-3 position led to the discovery of 3-O-3 ,3 -dimethylsuccinyl-OA (179) , which had significant antiviral EC 50 (0.86 nM) and TI (22 400) values. 213 However, due to differences in the screening system, the reported activity of 62 may vary in different publications. 211 The mechanism of action of 179 is similar to that of 161, which functions as a maturation inhibitor and blocks the cleavage of p25 to p24, resulting in the production of morphologically defective, noninfectious HIV particles. The SAR of 3-O-acyl OAs with different succinyl or glutaryl substitution showed similar trends compared with 3-O-acyl BA analogues, suggesting that the C-3 side chain is a very important pharmacophore, while the triterpene backbone may serve as a docker allowing the side chains to interact with the targets.",

In 2003, Sun's group began a phytochemical study of several species of the Schisandra genus collected in the Yunnan province of China, which led to the discovery of a series of norcycloartane triterpenoids. During 2006-2008, Sun's group also identified several nortriterpenoids and bisnortriterpenoids from various species of Schisandra that possessed weak to moderate anti-HIV-1 activity. [218] [219] [220] Rubriflordilactones A (191) and B (192) were isolated from the leaves and stems of Schisandra rubriflora. 221 Rubriflorins A-C (193) (194) (195) , three highly oxygenated nortriterpenoids, were also isolated from the leaves and stems Schisandra rubriflora. 222 They feature an opened A-ring. (196) (197) (198) (199) (200) (201) (202) were found in the same plant shortly after the discovery of 193-195. 223 They also contain an opened A-ring and showed moderate to weak anti-HIV activity, with EC 50 values ranging from 26.4 to 167.0 \u00b5M. 223 Sphenadilactones A (203) and B (204) were isolated from the leaves and stems of Schisandra sphenanthera. 224 Their structural elucidation was accomplished by extensive NMR and single-crystal X-ray crystallography. However, an erratum was later published to correct the stereochemistry of Me-27, which should have an -rather than -orientation. 225 Compound 203 exhibited very weak anti-HIV-1 activity, with an EC 50 of 237.8 \u00b5M in HIV-1 IIIB -infected C8166 cells. 224 No obvious cytotoxicity was observed when both compounds were tested against three human tumor cell lines, K562, A549, and HT-29. A minor nortriterpenoid, sphenadilactone C (205) , was also isolated in a subsequent study of Schisandra sphenanthera. 226 It is characterized by the presence of a partial enol structure, and is the first example of an acetamide-bearing highly oxygenated nortriterpenoid from a cycloartane. Compound 205 also exhibited very weak antiviral activity against HIV-1 IIIB , with an EC 50 The genus Kadsura belongs to the family Schisandraceae. In an investigation of Kadsura heteroclita, a new nortriterpenoid, long-ipedlactone J (223) , was isolated. When tested in HIV-1 IIIB infected C8166 cells, 223 showed a moderate anti-HIV EC 50 of 7.1 \u00b5M. 232 Four new lanostane triterpenes, colossolactones V, VI, VII,and VIII (224) (225) (226) (227) , were isolated from the fruiting bodies of the Vietnamese mushroom Ganoderma colossum. 233 With seco A-and E-rings, 224 and 225 differ structurally from previous isolated colossolactones, which have a seven-membered lactone A-ring and six-membered lactone Ering. Compound 226 has a lactone E-ring, but seco A-ring, while compound 227 has both Aand E-lactone rings. These three new triterpenoids, together with three previously isolated compounds, collosolactone E (228), schisanlactone A (229), and colossolactone G (230), were tested against HIV-1 protease. Compounds 224, 226, 228, and 229 showed antiprotease activity, with EC 50 values of 14.6, 24.7, 15.3, and 10.8 \u00b5M, respectively, while 225, 227, and 230 were inactive. 233 The presence of a hydroxy group at C-23 (R 3 ) or C-5 (R 2 ) in the tested compounds reduced the activity (i.e., 227 vs. 228 and 230 vs. 228), suggesting that the hydrophobicity of the triterpene skeleton is important to the anti-HIV-1 protease inhibition activity. For the A-ring seco compounds, 224 (with a single double bond at C-8-C-9) exhibited higher activity than the related 225 with two double bonds at C-7-C-8 and C-9-C-11. The unsaturation pattern would alter the three-dimensional structures and, consequently, the spatial arrangement of pharmacophores in the compounds, which have a significant influence on activity. On the other hand, the presence of the seco or lactone A-and/or E-ring did not significantly influence the anti-HIV protease activity of the analogues.",

However, because 99 is the first reported common cucurbitane analogue with potent antiviral activity, repeated evaluation may be necessary to confirm the compound's potency. Kuguacins A-E (234-238) were isolated from roots of Momordica charantia. 235 They also belong to the cucurbitacin family. 236 Further mechanism of action study revealed that they can block the transmission of virus through cell-to-cell fusion, but cannot inhibit the activities of HIV-1 RT, PR, NCp7 zinc ejection, or viral replication in chronically infected H9 lymphocytes. 236 Thus, it is likely that 239 and 240 function as HIV-1 entry inhibitors.",

            "text": "Triterpenoids are an important group for biologically active natural compounds, particularly with approximately 300 new triterpenoids identified each year. Since 1985, Connolly and Hill have regularly reviewed the scientific literature dealing with triterpenoid characterization from natural resources. [239] [240] [241] [242] [243] [244] [245] [246] [247] [248] [249] [250] [251] [252] [253] [254] [255] [256] Although numerous triterpenoids possessing various scaffolds have been reported, only a small portion of them were explored systematically for their pharmacological activities. Of those so explored, most showed only marginal potency in preliminary screening. However, this fact does not mean that they should be eliminated from further investigation. For instance, while betu-linic acid (1) exhibited only moderate anti-HIV activity, with an EC 50 of 1.4 \u00b5M, modification of 1 furnished the clinical trial agent, bevirimat (161) , soon to be a phase III anti-HIV drug. Another example is CDDO (63), a promising anticancer candidate in phase I clinical trials, which was derived from oleanolic acid (62), a weak antitumor compound. Generally speaking, bioactivity-directed fractionation and isolation (BDFI) is a major approach for new lead generation, which is then followed by lead optimization based on rational drug design, synthesis, and bioevaluation, as well as structure-activity relationship (SAR) and quantitative-SAR (QSAR) studies. Selection of a preclinical candidate also involves rapid, efficient assays to gather absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) data, permitting an effective evaluation of drug candidates in the early stages of the drug discovery process. Although there are still some concerns, especially regarding structure complexity and non-specific pharmacological effects of naturally occurring bioactive triterpenoids, their diversity and uniqueness make them worthy of further pursuit for the discovery of new drugs. Simplified apoptotic signaling scheme and modulation by AKBA (from ref. 83): (+) positive or upregulatory effects of AKBA; (\u2212) negative or inhibitory effects. IKK is the only target for which a direct inhibition by AKBA has been postulated. n.e.: no effect. Bevirimat (161) targets Gag at the CA-SP1 cleavage site to interfere with the processing of p25 into mature p24, resulting in the production of morphologically defective, noninfectious viral particles.
