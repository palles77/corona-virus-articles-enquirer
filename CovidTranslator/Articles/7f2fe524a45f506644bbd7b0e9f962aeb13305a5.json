Both on macroscopic and histological examination of the central nervous system, purulent meningitis was recognized. Bacteriological examination of the tarsal joints and the intestinum was negative for pathogenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella organisms. In the meninges M. varigena was recognized as a pure culture. Identification of the bacterial species was done by phenotyping and genotyping as described earlier (Catry et al., 2004) . Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (Kirby Bauer diffusion according to NCCLS guidelines) showed no acquired resistance for fluoroquinolones and other commonly used veterinary antibiotics. Supplementary laboratory investigation consisted of a direct identification test for antigens of Rota-and Coronavirus, E. coli F5, and Cryptosporidium parvum in the faeces (Bio-X Digestive ELISA Kit; Bio-X Diagnostics). All four ELISA tests were negative.",

Hence, diarrhoea, septic arthritis, and omphalophlebitis are frequently reported concurrent clinical symptoms. In the present case, a systemic infection was indicated by the pathological findings in distinct anatomical sites. Early clinical symptoms of meningitis, e.g., lethargy and recumbency, are non-specific. Ante-mortem diagnosis is therefore difficult and consists of macroscopic inspection of the cerebrospinal fluid along with determination of the differential leucocyte count and glucose concentration (Smith, 1996; Nazifi et al., 1997) .",

In calves coliforms, Salmonella spp., streptococci, Mycoplasma spp. and Pasteurellaceae have been reported (Smith, 1996) . While some authors report an association with septicaemia and mastitis, bovine pathogenic Pasteurellaceae are mostly associated with respiratory disease. In 1999, the trehalose negative [Pasteurella] haemolytica complex was transformed into a new genus Mannheimia (Angen et al., 1999) . Extensive phenotyping is required to differentiate the members of this new genus. Consequently, routine bacteriological investigations do not cope with the delineation of these new species. It is therefore not clear which Mannheimia species were involved in previous reports on bovine meningitis in which [Pasteurella] haemolytica was identified.",

In this case, M. varigena was isolated as a pure culture from purulent meninges, strongly indicating pathogenicity during this fatal course of septicaemia. Inflammation of the meninges occurs most commonly as a complication of a pre-existing disease. Since antigen detection for common intestinal bovine pathogens and bacteriological examination of the tarsal joints and intestines were negative, it is unclear whether other pathogens (e.g., Mycoplasma spp.) might have been primarily involved. Leukotoxin (LKT) is an important ruminant-specific virulence factor in M. haemolytica, reported to be correlated with the presence of ruminantspecific haemolysis (Fisher et al., 1999) . Because M. varigena is also haemolytic on ruminant blood (Catry et al., 2004) , it is likely that M. varigena possesses a similar LKT. Vaccination based on immunization against LKT or other Mannheimia related virulence factors may therefore contribute to the prevention of septicaemia in young calves in which (haemolytic) Mannheimia spp. are involved.",
