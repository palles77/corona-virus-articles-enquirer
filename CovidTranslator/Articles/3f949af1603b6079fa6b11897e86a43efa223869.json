URTIs are one of the most common medical conditions affecting athletes. Athletes are often in close contact with others in team locker rooms, at practice, or during travel, all of which increase their risk of infection. In addition, the stress of training, traveling, competition, and environmental exposure suppresses the athlete's immune system.",

            "text": "The question of whether exercise increases the risk of URTIs has been studied by several investigators and remains controversial. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] These studies vary widely with respect to subjects, methods, and exercise load. 4 Several epidemiologic studies (observational and case series) have supported the \"J\" curve relationship between exercise and the risk of URTI. 1, 2 This model suggests that moderate exercise improves immune function compared with sedentary persons, but prolonged high-intensity exercise may impair immune function by release of stress hormones. A \"window period\" of suppressed cell-mediated immunity often follows strenuous exercise. 3 A dose-response relationship between exercise load and risk of URTI is difficult to prove. 4 It has been reported that up to 2 hours of moderate activity daily improved overall health in individuals and decreased URTIs by 29% compared with sedentary individuals. 5 However, in the case of more extreme physical exertion in a study of marathon racers, running greater than 97 km/wk appeared to lead to more respiratory infections. Endurance events such as marathons were associated with infection in the week post race. 6 However, world-class athletes may be able to tolerate heavy physiologic demands without significant immune suppression. 7 Unfortunately, randomized controlled trials are difficult to conduct, and the current available studies reinforce the complex causal association between exercise and susceptibility to respiratory tract infections. 4 ",

            "text": "URTIs account for the majority of lost training time in athletes. Most URTIs are benign and self-limited, have an incubation period of 24-72 hours, and typically last 1-2 weeks. Symptoms are nonspecific and include sore throat, cough, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, headaches, body aches, and fever. Viruses are the most frequent cause of URTI. Common viruses include rhinoviruses, cornaviruses, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Human respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus, which cause more severe illness in children, elderly people, and the immunocompromised, may also cause URTIs. A study evaluating athletes who had \u03fe48 hours of typical URI symptoms only found causative agents in 30% of cases using a variety of isolation techniques including serology, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from nasopharyngeal, saliva, and blood samples. 8 In this study, rhinovirus was most often isolated, followed by adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, parainfluenza 3, Hemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. It is unclear whether symptoms last longer in athletes as epidemiologic studies have reported conflicting results. 8, 9 Viral URTIs can be transmitted through direct contact and/or aerosolization of viral particles. Person to person spread depends on the amount of time people spend together and in close communities secondary attack rates can be as high as 70%. Hand to hand contact is the most common means of transmission followed by the spread of infection through the inoculation of virus in the nose or eyes of susceptible persons. Proper hand washing in the athlete is highly encouraged as an important preventive measure.",

Antibiotics should be considered for symptoms lasting \u03fe10 days or severe symptoms such as fever, facial pain, or perioribital swelling. While amoxicillin is preferred, emerging resistance has led to the use of amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin), macrolides, and fluoroquinolones.

While much lower than children, carriage rates among adults is likely around 5% but varies by population. 16 Untreated, convalescent patients can transmit infection also. Prompt use of antibiotics minimizes secondary spread. 9 The Centor criteria (fever \u03fe38\u00b0C, lack of cough, pharyngotonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical adenopathy) does not distinguish most bacterial and viral cases; thus, rapid testing and culture should be performed on suspected cases. In addition to pharyngeal findings in GABHS infection, a scarlet rash may appear on the body. Identification and treatment of GABHS is important to minimize the risk for complications. Treatment prevents lymphadenitis, abscess, sinusitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and acute rheumatic fever but does not prevent post streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

Gradual onset of respiratory symptoms usually precede headache, fever, and cough with minimal sputum production. Confirmation of diagnosis can be difficult. Rapid PCR of sputum samples have limited sensitivity and IgM serology often fails to develop in adults. PCR and serology in combination have been recommended. 20 The fastidious nature of mycoplasma makes in vitro growth difficult. Chest radiograph findings of diffuse interstitial involvement and extrapulmonary involvement such as bullous myringitis, arthritis, and skin eruptions may aid in diagnosis. Some evidence suggests mycoplasma pneumonia may contribute to the development of asthma. 21 Symptoms of viral pneumonias due to influenza A and B viruses can be mitigated by the use of neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir and zanamivir if given within 72 hours. These agents have no documented activity against other viruses associated with pneumonias. Coccidiomycosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis are potential respiratory pathogens for athletes training or competing in an area with these endemic fungi; however, most infections are asymptomatic.",

Diagnosis can be made by PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirate. Pertussis is highly communicable, reaching 80% in households among unimmunized contacts and 20% in immunized contacts. Macrolides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are effective agents. Athletes who have confirmed or probable pertussis should be isolated for 5 days from beginning of treatment. Athletes known to be in close contact with a known or suspected case of pertussis should receive prophylactic antibiotic therapy with a macrolide.",

To prevent spread among athletes, in the case of influenza, the athlete should be kept from the training room practices and competitions until 5 days after the onset of symptoms. 11, 17 Prevention Athletes should be immunized against seasonal influenza. In addition, a booster dose of the acellular pertussis vaccine (available as TdaP) should be administered in young adults to reduce the transmission of pertussis. 23 The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is recommended for athletes with asthma who have cochlear implants, or chronic medical conditions. Preventive infection-control measures should be taken to avoid infection. These include regular hand washing, minimal contact with sick persons, and the avoidance of sharing personal items.
