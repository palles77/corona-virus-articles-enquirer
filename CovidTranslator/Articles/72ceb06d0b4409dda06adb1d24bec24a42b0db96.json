Results BCG treatment was able to inhibit an established allergic Th2-response, by decreasing the allergen-induced eosinophilic inflammation, EPO activity, levels of CCL11 and IL-4, serum levels of IgE and IgG1.

            "text": "The increasing prevalence of allergic diseases and asthma, particularly in industrialized countries, has led to the hygiene hypothesis, which states that the newborn infant's immune system is skewed toward Th2 responses and needs timely and appropriate environmental stimulus to create a balanced immune response [4, 5] . Supporting this hypothesis, epidemiological and experimental evidence has shown an inverse correlation between Th1-induced microbial infections and allergic diseases [6] . Similarly, some animal studies have demonstrated that exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis or to environmental mycobacteria is able to protect against the development of allergic responses [7, 8] , introducing the concept that the administration of mycobacteria and their products may therefore be used as vaccines aimed at inhibiting Th2 responses. However the exact mechanism underlying this inhibition still remains poorly understood. Induction of Th1 cytokines, such as interferon-\u03b3, has been suggested to cause a shift from Th2 to Th1 immune responses [9, 10] , thus subsequently preventing inflammatory allergic immune response. Nevertheless some results indicated that the immunological mechanism behind this inhibition it is much more complex than is predicted by this and additional non-Th1-Th2 immunological regulatory mechanism may play a much more prominent role [11] . In this context, some clinical and experimental studies have also highlighted the important role of regulatory T cells (Treg) in the control of allergic diseases, providing evidence that it works in a manner that is, in part, dependent on IL-10 or TGF-\u03b2 or both [12] [13] [14] . Additionally, it has been well established that the transcription factor Foxp3, as well as the Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4), has a key role in the function of Treg cells [15, 16] and would be crucial to modulate an allergen-induced inflammation [17] . Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that treatment of newborn mice with Mycobacterium bovis-BCG or Mycobacterium vaccae before ovalbumin-sensitization was effective in reducing allergen induced-airway eosinophilia by giving rise to Treg cells [18] . On the other hand, some studies failed to show an effective suppression of allergic features after an allergen challenge [19] , suggesting that the therapeutic efficacy of BCG treatment in mouse models of allergy remains controversial. The present study aimed to evaluate the ability of BCG to suppress an established allergic response in a BALB/c mouse model of OVA-induced airway inflammation to achieve new insights into the mechanisms of how mycobacteria exert their anti-inflammatory effect.",

            "text": "The recent increase in the prevalence of allergic disorders, particularly in industrialized countries, provides support for the additional role of environmental factors in the pathogenesis of immune hypersensitivity [21] . Indeed, epidemiological evidence suggests that there is an inverse correlation between the immune response to viral and bacterial infections and the development and prevalence of allergic diseases [6] . In this context, many experimental studies showed that Mycobacterium bovis-Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG)-and other mycobacteria are effective in preventing allergic and asthmatic responses, probably through Th1 or regulatory T-cell immune responses [18, [22] [23] [24] . However, the therapeutic efficacy of BCG treatment on allergic airway inflammation after allergen challenge remains poorly understood and controversial. In the current study, the effect of giving BCG to mice with previous exposure to allergen was evaluated. The results showed that the mycobacteria treatment was able to inhibit the OVA-induced airway inflammation by reducing the mainly pathogenic allergic features, such as airway eosinophilic inflammation, IgE/ IgG1 production by B cells, type 2 cytokine productions and mucus hypersecretion. The reduction of airway pathogenesis to allergen was associated with a switch from Th2-type immune response towards to both Th1 and regulatory T immune responses. Interestingly, the intranasal BCG administration recruited CD4 + T cells expressing Foxp3 and CTLA-4 to the lungs accompanied by an increase in IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells. The protective properties of BCG vaccination were thought to lie mainly in its ability to induce effector CD4 and CD8 T cell responses which secrete cytokines including IFN-\u03b3 [25, 26] . In the same way, BCG-driven IFN-\u03b3 production has been proposed to shift allergen-specific responses from the Th2 to the Th1 phenotype, subsequently inhibiting the airway inflammatory immune response [27] . In keeping with preview studies [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] , the present results demonstrated that the improvement of airway inflammation was correlated with an increased IFN-\u03b3 production and this was associated with suppression of IL-4, as well with a relevant IgE and IgG1 shift towards to IgG2a protective isotype production. Altogether, these results suggest that, in this allergy model, IFN-\u03b3 had an important role as a master regulator of Th2 immune response since it has been well established that this cytokine exerts direct inhibitory effects on Th2 [33] as well as inducing IgG2a instead of IgE production by B cells [34] . On the other hand some studies have demonstrated that treatment with mycobacteria conferred protection against allergen lung inflammation by a mechanism independent of IFN-\u03b3 [22, 35] . Probably, this observed apparent discrepancy is due to differences in study design, particularly with regard to the temporal relationship between mycobacteria treatments and allergen exposure.",

In this context, it has been demonstrated that heat-killed M. vaccae treatment improves the pulmonary inflammation without inducing Th1 response [18, 24] . Instead, the protective effect was associated with an induction of CD4 + CD45RB low Treg cells that secrete IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 and upon transfer could protect recipient allergic mice from airway inflammation [11] .",

Therefore, aimed at confirming whether the BCGmodulator effect was associated with inducing of Treg cells, the expression of Foxp3 and CTLA-4 by CD4 + T cells was investigated. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that both Foxp3 and CTLA-4 expression were up-regulated in allergic BCG-treated mice, suggesting that cell-cell contact inhibition may be involved in the regulatory mechanism, in addition to the action of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2. These results are similar to those of an earlier study, although the authors of that study evaluated the preventive effect of a neonatal BCG vaccination in inhibiting an allergic eosinophilic inflammation induced in C57BL/6 mice [18] , while the present study assessed the ability of BCG to ameliorate an established allergic response in high Th2 responder BALB/c mice. In this respect, the findings are encouraging because modulation of established allergic T-cell responses is a challenge and more difficult than modulating primary responses [38] .",

            "text": "Given the key role of dendritic cells (DCs) in driving and maintaining immune responses to inhaled allergen, it may be possible that mycobacteria interfere with DC-driven Th2cell sensitization. Indeed, it has recently been demonstrated that CD8\u03b1 + and CD8\u03b1 -DCs subsets from BCG-infected mice produced IL-12 and IL-10 respectively, and the BCGmodulating effect was mediated by both immune deviation and regulation [39] . These data suggest that DCs should be an important coordinator of different BCG-induced allergy inhibition, raising the possibility that DCs might also be a prominent source of the IL-10 detected in this present work. Therefore, further study aimed at evaluating the effect of intra-nasal BCG treatment on DCs activation would be very helpful for understanding the mechanisms by which mycobacteria inhibits allergic inflammation. Finally, since recent reports have shown that CD8 + T lymphocytes may play an important regulatory activity [40] , the involvement of these cells was investigated. Surprisingly, the analysis revealed that CD8 + T cells from allergic mice had their IL-10 production increased after BCG administration, suggesting that these cells could be important in dampening down the allergeninduced lung inflammation. In the last few years, some studies have been carried out to shed light on the role of CD8 + T cells in the induction and regulation of inflammatory responses. Recently, it was demonstrated that CD8 + T cell-derived IL-10 diminished disease severity in mice with coronavirus-induced acute encephalitis [40] . In parallel, other studies have shown that the transfer of activated CD8 + T cells from sensitized mice reduces the production of allergen-specific IgE and the development of airway hyperactivity [41, 42] . These regulatory CD8 + T cells could exert their inhibitory effects directly by killing immune cells or indirectly by secreting IL-10 and TGF\u03b2 [43, 44] . According to these findings, preview research provided evidence that systemic immunization with allergen induces regulatory CD8 + T cells which were able to inhibit the development of allergic diarrhea by a mechanism that involves IL-10 expression [45] .",

The results showed evidence of the coexistence of immune deviation and regulatory mechanisms for the modulating effect on Th2-airway inflammation by BCG. The increased production of IFN-\u03b3, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 associated with a higher Foxp3 and CTLA-4 expression seemed to be decisive in this inhibitory effect. Moreover, mycobacteria treatment induces IL-10 production by CD8 + T cells, suggesting participation of other important regulating mechanisms in addition to CD4 + T regulatory cells. Although a therapeutic role for BCG is compatible with the current version of the hygiene hypothesis, analysis of this hypothesis is in progress and the exact mechanism of how BCG exerts its effects remains open. Therefore, further studies should be carried out to elucidate whether it will be possible to use mycobacteria selectively to induce allergen-specific T regulatory cells. Furthermore, new insights into the mechanisms of action of BCG treatment should help to understand the abnormalities of the immune response resulting in allergic diseases.",
