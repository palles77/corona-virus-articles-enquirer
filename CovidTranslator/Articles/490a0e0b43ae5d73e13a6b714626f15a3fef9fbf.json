These differences are attributed to differences in cultural norms, mitigation efforts, and health infrastructure. Here we propose that national differences in COVID-19 impact could be partially explained by the different national policies respect to Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) childhood vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. We compared large number of countries BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. We also found that BCG vaccination also reduced the number of reported COVID-19 cases in a country. The combination of reduced morbidity and mortality makes BCG vaccination a potential new tool in the fight against COVID-19.",

However, there are some striking differences on how COVID-19 is behaving in different countries. For instance, in Italy there has been strong curtailing of social interactions and COVID-19 mortality is still high. In contrast, Japan had some of the earlier cases, but the mortality is low despite not having adopted some the more restrictive social isolation measurements. These puzzling differences have been adjudicated to different cultural norms as well as differences in medical care standards. Here we propose an alternative explanation: that the country-by-country difference in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality can be partially explained by national policies on Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination.",

This phenomenon was named 'trained immunity' and is proposed to be caused by metabolic and epigenetic changes leading to promotion of genetic regions encoding for pro-inflammatory cytokines 3 . BCG vaccination significantly increases the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, specifically IL-1B, which has been shown to play a vital role in antiviral immunity 4 . Additionally, a study 5 in Guinea-Bissau found that children vaccinated with BCG were observed to have a 50% reduction in overall mortality, which was attributed to the vaccine's effect on reducing respiratory infections and sepsis.",

We included only countries with more than 1 million inhabitants. The mortality rate might be influenced by multiple factors including a country's standard of medical care. In order to account for that, we classified countries according to their GNI per capita in 2018 using the World Bank data (https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-worldbank-country-and-lending-groups). Countries were divided in three categories: low income (L) with an annual income of 1,025 dollars or less, lower middle income with an income between 1,026 and 3,995 dollars, and middle high and high income countries, which included countries with annual incomes over 3,996 dollars. In order to determine if BCG vaccination was protective for COVID-19 infections, we used the number of deaths per million inhabitants per country attributed to COVID-19 (see attached table) . Most of the countries with low-income levels (17/18) reported zero deaths attributed to COVID-19 and have universal BCG policies in place consistent with a protective role of BCG vaccination. However, this might be because of underreporting and we have excluded them from the analysis. Middle high and high-income countries that have a current universal BCG policy (55 countries) had 0.78\u00b1 0.40 (mean\u00b1s.e.m) deaths per million people (see Figure 1 ). In contrast, middle high and high income countries that never had a universal BCG policy (5 countries) had a larger mortality rate, with 16.39 \u00b1 7.33 deaths per million people.

We speculate that this could have created a pool of potential hosts that would be affected by and spread COVID-19. Currently, however, the situation in China seems to be improving.",
