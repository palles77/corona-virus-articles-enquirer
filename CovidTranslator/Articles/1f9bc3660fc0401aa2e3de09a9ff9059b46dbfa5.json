Travelers may be at increased risk of certain respiratory tract infections (RTIs) due to travel itself (mingling and close quarters in airports, airplanes, cruise ships, and hotels; and risk of influenza, legionellosis, and tuberculosis [TB] ) and due to unique exposure at travel destinations (melioidosis, plague, Q fever, coccidioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis). Travel-related respiratory infections can lead to importation and secondary transmission, as occurred during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, and more recently with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and H1N1 influenza. 4 This chapter reviews causative agents, clinical manifestations, and management approaches for travel-related RTIs.",

Acute coryzal illness, traditionally referred to as a \"common cold,\" manifests as nasal discharge and obstruction, sneezing, and sore throat, and is most commonly caused by viruses, including rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus (especially coxsackievirus A21), coronaviruses, and metapneumonia virus. Acute laryngitis is characterized by hoarseness of voice with a deepened pitch, with possible episodes of aphonia. Often these signs are associated with those of coryza and pharyngitis. Common causes of laryngitis include parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and adenovirus. Less frequently, laryngitis can be caused by bacteria including Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Pharyngitis is also most commonly viral in origin, although streptococcal disease accounts for a significant minority.

            "text": "Travel destination, exposure, and activities should be considered in returned travelers with an RTI, as shown in However, that rate, which is equivalent to 0.2 episodes/person/year, is much lower than the incidence of common respiratory diseases among adults in the United States. 6 The difference is likely to be attributable to underreporting among travelers, because a large proportion of RTIs are mild, not incapacitating, and not reported. In the literature, there are large variations in the proportion of respiratory infections among all causes of illness in returning travelers. Comparison among studies, however, is difficult, and differences are likely to reflect diverse diagnostic procedures and definitions of syndromes rather than true epidemiologic differences. Still, RTIs consistently rank among the most frequently diagnosed and/or reported conditions among travelers. Attack rates in reported studies have ranged from 5% to 40%. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] In a large database of ill travelers from all continents within the GeoSentinel Surveillance System, Freedman described a frequency of respiratory disorders of 77 per 1000 ill returned travelers, ranging from 45/1000 in the Caribbean to 97/1000 in Southeast Asia. 2 In that analysis, respiratory disorders that prompted the seeking of medical care were less commonly reported than systemic febrile illnesses, acute diarrhea, dermatologic disorders, chronic diarrhea, and nondiarrheal gastrointestinal disorders. 2 Using the same database, Leder and colleagues reported that upper and lower respiratory diagnoses were found in 11% of all travelers. Most respiratory illnesses were due to infections with a worldwide distribution, including nonspecific upper respiratory infections, influenza or influenza-like illness, bronchitis, and pneumonia (lobar and atypical). Influenza A, B, or H1N1 was diagnosed in 8% of travelers with a respiratory illness. There were 35 cases of legionellosis. 14 Infants, small children, the elderly, and subjects with chronic tracheobronchial or cardiopulmonary diseases are at increased risk of developing severe clinical consequences from RTIs. In a study by Gautret et al., respiratory disease ranked as the second most frequent reason for presentation to a GeoSentinel site in the older adults (age >60 years). Older travelers had a greater proportionate morbidity from lower RTI, including pneumonia and bronchitis. 26 ",

            "text": "Among upper RTIs (see Fig. 59 .1), the isolated coryzal syndrome is rarely a cause of medical consultation. No additional diagnostic procedures are required and treatment is usually supportive. The diagnosis of laryngitis is also clinical, and treatment is usually supportive. Although the diagnosis of pharyngitis is also clinical, it is important to identify individuals with pharyngitis caused by group A streptococcal infection from other causes to lessen the likelihood of subsequent sequelae, including glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever. Bacterial pharyngitis is reportedly associated with more severe pharyngeal pain, odynophagia, and higher fever, with grayish-yellow exudate on the tonsils and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. However, clinical criteria are unreliable to identify bacterial pharyngitis/tonsillitis because a typical presentation occurs in <50% of cases. Rapid antigen detection tests are available with a specificity >95% when compared with blood-agar plate cultures and sensitivity of 80%-90%, and should generally be performed in patients ill enough to seek medical care for pharyngitis, especially in young children. A negative rapid test should be followed by a confirmatory throat culture in children and adolescents but not necessarily in adults. Nucleic acid amplification tests including isothermal loop amplification are also available in some locations with a high degree of specificity and sensitivity as well as a rapid turnaround time. A treatment course with penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days is appropriate to treat pharyngitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes. Diphtheria is a rare cause of pharyngitis, with a potentially fatal outcome. It is characterized by a O'Brien et al. studied a group of 232 sick travelers at a tertiary hospital in Australia who had largely traveled through Asian countries: RTIs were second after malaria, accounting for 24% of cases. 15 In that series, lower tract infections accounted for 50% of all RTIs, and were almost equally distributed between bacterial pneumonia and influenza. 15 Bacterial pneumonia was significantly more common in patients aged >40 years, with an odds ratio (OR) of 5.5. One-quarter of upper tract infections were due to group A Streptococcus. In a multicenter hospital study in Italy, of 541 travelers with fever, 8.1% of the patients had a respiratory syndrome, one-third of whom had pneumonia. TB was responsible for 29% of pneumonia cases in this cohort. Among cases with RTI and no signs of pneumonia, malaria was the underlying disease in 11 of 27. 16 In an analysis of GeoSentinel data on ill children after international travel, approximately 86% of ill children had four major syndromes: 28% had a diarrheal process; 25% had a dermatologic disorder; 23% had a systemic febrile illness; and 11% had a respiratory disorder. Upper RTI (38%), hyperactive airway disease (20%), and acute otitis media (17%) accounted for the majority of the cases of respiratory syndrome in these children. 17 In a Swiss study, Hunziker et al. found that leading diagnoses in children aged up to 16 years who presented with travelassociated illness were diarrhea (39%), respiratory (29%), and febrile/ systemic illness (13%). Among travelers returning from Asia and America (South, Central, and North), respiratory illness was the most frequent diagnosis. 18 ",

The European Legionnaires' Disease Surveillance Network (ELDSNET) reports legionella cases diagnosed in patients who have been traveling within the likely incubation period of 2 weeks, together with geographic location of suspected source of transmission. Members of the group report cases of legionnaires disease to the coordinating center, which then notifies all members of any disease cluster. Other international global and regional surveillance networks, including GeoSentinel, TropNet, and EuroTravNet, play a thick and gray pharyngeal and tracheal membrane that bleeds upon attempted removal. Diagnosis is based on clinical recognition and culture isolation of a toxigenic strain of C. diphtheriae. The mainstay of therapy is diphtheria antitoxin, associated with antibiotic treatment with penicillin or macrolides.

Examination usually discloses pulmonary crepitation, rhonchi, and adventitial sounds. Chest imaging should be used to further characterize and define pulmonary involvement. Complications of pneumonia include pulmonary cavitation, pneumothorax, and empyema formation. In many facilities, it is now standard to collect nasopharyngeal swabs or washings from patients with severe RTIs and pneumonia, and to apply rapid antigen tests to assess for common respiratory viruses, including influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and metapneumonia virus. Although the majority of cases with radiologic evidence of pneumonia may still have a viral infection, the proportion of cases due to bacteria is high enough to usually warrant systematic antibacterial treatment, especially if a viral screen is unrevealing. The chest film is not helpful in making a specific etiologic diagnosis; however, lobar consolidation, cavitation, and large pleural effusions support a bacterial cause. Pneumococcal disease is often characterized by abrupt onset of fever, cough, rapid respiration, and lobar consolidation on chest film. Atypical pneumonias caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae may be characterized by gradual onset of symptoms, cough progressive from dry to productive, chest film worse than symptoms, and normal peripheral white blood cell counts. Overall, however, the clinical presentation is not specific enough to make an etiologic diagnosis, and effective methods to recognize the causative agent of pneumonia are not available. The sputum Gram stain is a simple, quick, and inexpensive procedure, but its helpfulness in establishing a specific etiologic diagnosis is uncertain. The utility of the sputum culture is also unclear, since the procedure is insensitive: Only half of patients with pneumonia produce sputum and contamination occurs in one-third. An advantage of routine sputum Gram stain and culture is that these procedures would capture rare causes of pneumonia such as TB and melioidosis in travelers. Because the cause of pneumonia cannot be determined on the basis of any specific clinical, radiographic, or laboratory parameter, antibiotic therapy is usually initiated empirically. Treatment should be effective on S. pneumoniae, the most frequently responsible agent, and on agents of atypical pneumonia: M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and legionella infections.",

Influenza virus infections were acquired largely in Asia (48%), Africa (28%), and Latin America (25%). 36 Travelers acquire influenza both as sporadic cases and as clusters from common sources aboard ships, airplanes or in airports, and in tour groups. All described outbreaks are caused by the type A virus, and are characterized by involvement of a large proportion of the population at risk and the explosive nature of outbreaks. Data collected from GeoSentinel and EuroTravNet indicate that in 2008, prior to the H1N1 pandemic, the number of influenza confirmed cases was at just 0.1%. During 2009, however, the number of confirmed influenza cases in GeoSentinel pivotal role in early detection and public warning of travel-related epidemics. 31, 32 International health authorities may impose and have imposed public health interventions during worrisome outbreaks (e.g., H5N1 and H1N1 influenza, and SARS), including animal culling, travel restrictions, screening at airports and points of arrival and departure, and quarantine in efforts to limit the spread of respiratory infections.",

In 2015, 60% of the detected clusters of travel-associated legionnaires disease were characterized by initial cases from several different countries. 41 The Mediterranean region in Europe has been the origin of most reported outbreaks, but no area is excluded from risk, as exemplified by the identification of a cluster of cases associated with a hotel in Bangkok. 42 Transmission is airborne, but the source of infection is the environment rather than other persons. The incubation period is classically considered as 2-10 days, although 16% of 188 cases described in a large outbreak in the Netherlands reported incubation periods >10 days. 43 The clinical spectrum is wide, ranging from subclinical to lethal manifestations. The overt picture of legionellosis is that of a lobar pneumonia with abrupt onset characterized by high fever, severe headache, and confusion. 44 Patchy infiltrates are often present bilaterally. Mortality may be as high as 20% if diagnosis and antibiotic treatment are delayed. Diagnosis is usually based on detection of antigen in urine (for L. pneumophila type 1, with 80% sensitivity and 99% specificity). Culture can also be employed. Where available, PCR can be used to identify L. pneumophila from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and other clinical specimens. Treatment is often empiric: macrolides are the treatment of choice.

Specificities of rapid diagnostic tests are generally higher, approximately 95%-100%.",

Coccidioidomycosis is caused by inhalation of Coccidioides immitis, a dimorphic fungus found in dust and soil. The pathogen is present only in semiarid regions of the Americas. Symptomatic disease develops in approximately 40% of individuals infected by C. immitis, presenting as a flulike syndrome. The radiologic finding is often that of hilar pneumonia with lymphadenitis and pleural involvement. In a well-described outbreak of coccidioidomycosis in a 126-member church group traveling to Mexico, the average incubation period was 12 days (range 7-20 days); chest pain was present in 76% and cough in 66% of the affected travelers. 58 The diagnosis is serologic, and antibodies appear 1-3 weeks after the onset of symptoms.",

The agent is ubiquitous, but diffusion is higher in the tropical belt and the United States. Outbreaks of acute histoplasmosis among travelers have been repeatedly reported. [59] [60] [61] The disease may evolve as a mild, spontaneously resolving condition, but severe and systemic disease may develop in immunocompromised patients. Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis (APH) in returning travelers typically presents as a flulike illness with high-grade fever, chills, headache, nonproductive cough, pleuritic chest pain, and fatigue. Symptom onset is usually 1-3 weeks following exposure and most individuals recover spontaneously within 3 weeks. Chest x-ray may show patchy infiltrates or interstitial pneumonia. Diagnosis may be extremely difficult unless the disease is considered in the differential diagnosis, and most cases are unrecognized and considered as bacterial bronchitis or influenza. Confirmation of the disease usually involves a urine and serum antigen assay, or comparison of acute-phase and convalescent-phase serum specimens. Antifungal treatment is not usually indicated for mild to moderate APH in immunocompetent persons. For patients who continue to have symptoms for >1 month, itraconazole is recommended. Patients with moderately severe to severe APH should receive liposomal amphotericin B followed by itraconazole.",
