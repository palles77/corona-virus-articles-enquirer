            "text": "We sought to examine the relationship between the clinical manifestations of nonspecific reactive hepatitis and respiratory virus infection in pediatric patients. Methods: Patients admitted to the pediatric unit of Konyang University Hospital for lower respiratory tract disease between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014 and who underwent reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests were examined. The patients were divided into those with increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and those with normal ALT or AST levels. Further, patients with increased ALT and AST levels were individually compared with patients in the normal group, and the blood test results were compared according to the type of respiratory virus. Results: Patients with increased ALT or AST levels had one more day of hospital stay, on average, compared with patients in the normal group (5.3\u00b13.1 days vs. 4.4\u00b13.0 days, p=0.019). Patients in the increased ALT level group were younger and had a longer mean hospital stay, compared with patients in the normal group (p=0.022 and 0.003, respectively). The incidences of increased ALT or AST were the highest in adenovirus infections (6/24, 25.0%), followed by enterovirus (2/11, 18.2%) and respiratory syncytial virus A (21/131, 16.0%) infections. Conclusion: Nonspecific reactive hepatitis is more common among patients with adenovirus, enterovirus and respiratory syncytial virus infection, as well as among those infected at a younger age. Compared with AST levels, ALT levels are better indicators of the severity of nonspecific reactive hepatitis.",

In particular, increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) indicate acute hepatocellular injury, such as viral in-Pediatr Gastroenterol Hepatol Nutr fection, toxic injury, hypoxia, and hypoperfusion, where ALT and AST levels can rise by thousands of times the levels in the normal range. While ALT is relatively liver specific, AST levels can increase because of damage to other organs [1] . In addition, there are cases where non-hepatic respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infections lead to increased levels of ALT and AST without hepatic failure, and such conditions are referred to as nonspecific reactive hepatitis [2, 3] .",
