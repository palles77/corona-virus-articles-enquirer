Despite the recent renaissance in unsupervised neural networks for decoding unstructured natural languages, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the exponentially growing biomedical literature and its comprehensive triangulation with deep omic insights is not available. Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations extracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with Single Cell RNA-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues. Using this platform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of COVID-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We find that tongue keratinocytes, airway club cells, and ciliated cells are likely underappreciated targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to type II pneumocytes and olfactory epithelial cells. We further identify mature small intestinal enterocytes as a possible hotspot of COVID-19 fecal-oral transmission, where an intriguing maturation-correlated transcriptional signature is shared between ACE2 and the other coronavirus receptors DPP4 (MERS-CoV) and ANPEP (\u0251-coronavirus). This study demonstrates how a holistic data science platform can leverage unprecedented quantities of structured and unstructured publicly available data to accelerate the generation of impactful biological insights and hypotheses.",

The associated disease has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), with over 350,000 confirmed cases and 15,000 deaths across nearly every country as of March 23, 2020 1 . The constellation of symptoms, ranging from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to gastrointestinal issues, is similar to that observed in the 2002 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak. SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all caused by Coronaviruses (CoV), deriving their name from the crown-like spike proteins protruding from the viral capsid surface. Coronavirus infection is driven by the attachment of the viral spike protein to specific human cell-surface receptors: ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV 2-4 , DPP4 for MERS-CoV 5 and ANPEP for specific \u0251-coronaviruses 6 . In addition to these receptors, the protease activity of TMPRSS2 has also been implicated in viral entry 7, 8 .",

This approach immediately highlights renal proximal tubular cells and small intestinal enterocytes among the cell types that most robustly express ACE2 (detection in >40% of cells). These cell types are also moderately to strongly associated with ACE2 in the literature. The strong intestinal ACE2 expression is particularly interesting given the emerging clinical reports of fecal shedding and persistence post-recovery which may reflect a fecal-oral transmission pattern 10-12 . Conversely, pancreatic PP cells (gamma cells), pancreatic alpha cells, and keratinocytes show similarly robust ACE2 expression but have not been strongly associated with ACE2 in the literature. This combination suggests either a biological novelty or an experimental artifact. We note that the strong ACE2 expression in pancreatic cell types is derived from only one murine study (Figure S2A 19 ), while ACE2 expression is not observed in gamma or alpha cells from scRNA-seq of human pancreatic islets ( Figure S2B [20] [21] [22] ). While we cannot determine the validity of either observation, this example demonstrates how knowledge synthesis can automatically surface discordant biological signals for further evaluation. author/funder.

This observation was corroborated by complementary gene expression analysis of over 250,000 bulk RNA-seq samples from GTEx 23, 24 and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) along with protein expression analysis from healthy tissue proteomics and immunohistochemistry (IHC) datasets [25] [26] [27] , where lung and other respiratory tissues consistently show lower ACE2 expression compared to the digestive tract and kidney (Figure S3A-D) . However, the respiratory transmission of COVID-19 along with the disease symptomatology and well-documented viral shedding in respiratory secretions 28 strongly indicates that SARS-CoV-2 indeed infects and replicates within these tissues.

We also found that ACE2 is detected in type II pneumocytes in multiple studies, although the percentage of expressing cells ranges from only 0.5-7% (Figures 3A-B) . This relatively low expression, which may be deemed inconsequential if viewed in isolation, is strongly supported by knowledge synthesis that highlights an existing association between ACE2 and type II pneumocytes (Figures 3A-B) . Indeed, multiple studies have demonstrated ACE2 expression in these cells [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Further, ACE2 expression in bulk RNAseq of GTEx lung samples (n = 578) is strongly correlated to markers of type II pneumocytes, with all seven surfactant protein-encoding genes among the top 4% of transcriptional correlations to ACE2 (out of the ~19,000 genes expressed at > 1 TPM in GTEx lung samples; hypergeometric p-value = 1.1x10 -10 ) ( Figure S20) .",

In this context, we found that ACE2 shows an increase in expression correlated with the maturation of murine small intestinal enterocytes, with minimal expression in stem cells and transit amplifying cells in contrast to most robust expression in mature enterocytes ( Figure  4 ).

For this analysis, the vector space is constituted of the individual cells as the dimensions using the gene expression values to construct the vectors (see Methods). Interestingly, we found that ANPEP, the established entry receptor for HCoV-229E, showed the third highest cosine similarity to ACE2 ( Figure 5B ). Further, DPP4 -the entry receptor for MERS coronavirus -is also among the top 1% of similarly expressed genes by this metric (Figure 5B ). We confirmed that both of these genes do indeed show a maturation-correlated transcriptional pattern similar to that of ACE2 ( Figure 5C-D) , highlighting an unexpected shared pattern of transcriptional heterogeneity among known coronavirus receptors in a cell population which may be relevant for viral transmission.",

Briefly, the local score represents a traditional natural language processing technique which captures the strength of association between two concepts in a selected corpus of biomedical literature based on the frequency of their co-occurrence normalized by the frequency of each individual concept throughout the corpus. A higher local score between Concept X and Concept Y indicates that these concepts are frequently mentioned in close proximity to each other more frequently than would be expected by chance. The global score, on the other hand, is based on the neural network renaissance that has recently taken place in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. To compute global scores, all tokens (e.g. words and phrases) are projected in a high-dimensional vector space of word embeddings. These vectors serve to represent the \"neighborhood\" of concepts which occur around a given concept. The cosine distance between any two vectors author/funder. All rights reserved.
