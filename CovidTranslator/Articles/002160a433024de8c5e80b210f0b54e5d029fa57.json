            "text": "Infectious disease severely threatens human life. Human mobility and travel patterns influence the spread of infection between cities and countries. We find that the infection severity in downstream cities during outbreaks is related to transmission rate, recovery rate, travel rate, travel duration and the average number of person-to-person contacts per day. The peak value of the infected population in downstream cities is slightly higher than that in source cities. However, as the number of cities increases, the severity increase percentage during outbreaks between end and source cities is constant. The surveillance of important nodes connecting cities, such as airports and train stations, can help delay the occurrence time of infection outbreaks. The city-entry surveillance of hub cities is not only useful to these cities, but also to cities that are strongly connected (i.e., have a high travel rate) to them. The city-exit surveillance of hub cities contributes to other downstream cities, but only slightly to itself. Surveillance conducted in hub cities is highly efficient in controlling infection transmission. Only strengthening the individual immunity of frequent travellers is not efficient for infection control. However, reducing the number of person-toperson contacts per day effectively limits the spread of infection.",

Research on infection spread across cities and countries has mainly focused on human mobility based on historical data processing ( Opatowski et al., 2011 ) and mathematical models ( Charu et al., 2017 ) . Hyman and LaForce (2003) constructed a mathematical SIPR (where P is the stage of partial immunity) infection spread model across cities and analysed long-term infection spread trends. Kim et al. (2014) developed a mathematical model of multi-city transmission and simulated the outbreaks of pandemic influenza A in Korea across cities considering transportation impacts. Gautreau et al. (2008) used the Rvachev-Longini metapopulation model to analyse the arrival times of infectious disease on a global scale. Balcan et al. (2009) used a mobility (GLEaM) model to obtain multi-scale mobility networks to simulate infection spread across countries. Travellers, including business travellers, play an important role in infection spread across cities and countries ( Wang et al., 2012 ) . In the global network of human mobility ( Du et al., 2016 ) , travellers connect all cities and countries. Therefore, knowledge on how travel behaviour affects infectious disease transmission is useful to the prevention and control of infection spread between cities or even between countries. However, the previous research was insufficient because of a lack of the quantitative comparison between the source and downstream cities, the impacts of travel patterns, and efficiency of different surveillance strategies in the transportation hubs.",

As shown in Fig. 2 (a), when \u03b4 = 4% , P c d c s reaches the largest value of 4.40%. As \u03b4 increases, the P between the source city and the downstream city first increases and then decreases after the peak. Furthermore, the peak arrives earlier when R 0 is small. When R 0 = 1 . 5 , P c d c s reaches the largest value of 5.63% when \u03b4 = 4% . However, when R 0 = 2 . 5 , P c d c s reaches the largest value of 2.70% when \u03b4 = 3% . Therefore, the lower R 0 is, the higher the peak value of the P between the source city and the downstream city is ( Fig. 2 (b) ). changed if the product of \u03b2 and n p is a constant. We also find that P c d c s is not influenced by the total population of the city. The P between the source and the downstream city changes with travel duration ( Fig. 4 (a) ). Under a constant travel rate ( \u03b4 = 1% ) and R 0 (1.8), when the average travel duration changes from 1 to 7 days, the time delay for outbreak between the downstream city and the source city increases from 5.3 to 15.3 days. In addition, P c d c s decreases from 3.86% to < 0.01% with travel duration expansion. When travel duration increases, the population exchange rate between two cities decreases because the travel rate is constant. The impact of the source city on the downstream city is weakened. Fig. 4 (a) shows that P c d c s monotonically decreases as travel duration increases (1-7 days) when \u03b4 = 1% . A negative correlation between P c d c s and travel duration (1 to 7 days) still exists when \u03b4 = 2% ( Fig. 4 (b) ). In reality, \u03b4 \u2265 4% is possible when certain festivals arrive. As shown by the red and green dashed lines in Fig. 4 (b) , P c d c s does not monotonically decrease as travel duration increases. The peak value occurs at t T = 2 when \u03b4 = 4% and at t T = 3 when \u03b4 = 6% , respectively. A too high or too low population exchange rate between two cities leads to a low P c d c s . Therefore, a high travel rate with a low travel duration or a low travel rate with a high travel duration decreases P c d c s . Based on our default settings ( R 0 = 1 . 8 , \u03b2 = 1 . 56 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , \u03b3 = 0 . 014 h \u22121 and n p = 400 ), P c d c s peaks when t T /\u03b4 = 50 . Fig. 5 shows how the travel patterns between five cities influence infectious disease transmission (the P between five cities, the severity of infection outbreak and the outbreak occurrence time). In Fig. 5 (a) , infectious disease transmits from source city A to end city E city by city (i.e., A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 E ). To maintain a constant population in each city at all times, \u03b4 = 1% is set in cities A and E and \u03b4 = 2% is set in cities B, C and D . The peak value of infected individuals during outbreaks is the same in cities B, C and D , with an average P BCD A = 0 . 50% ( Fig. 5 (a) ). The P between the middle cities is close to 0. City E is the end city and P E A = 2 . 33% . Comparing P E A to the P c d c s with only two cities ( Fig. 2 (a) ), the P between the source city and the end city is almost the same ( P E A \u2248 P c d c s ). In Fig. 5 (a) , city B receives infected tourists from source city A during the infection rising period and delivers infected people to city C at the same time. City A, B , and C like three bottles of solution. City B receives a highly concentrated solution from city A , but is also diluted by city C . However, P E D is high because the end city ( E ) only absorbs the highly concentrated solution from city D without any dilution caused by the other cities. Therefore, P E D and P B A are big, whereas P C B and P D C are very small.",

The peak value of the infected population during the outbreaks in the second downstream cities ( C and D ) is higher than the first downstream cities ( B and E ) and the source city, A ( P BE A = 1 . 36% , P CD A = 2 . 41% ). This is consistent with the law that the P between the source city ( C s ) and the end city ( C e ) is constant ( P c e c s \u2248 2 . 4% ). In the circular travel pattern, both cities B and E are the first downstream cities. The only difference between city B and city E is the direction of travel ( A \u2192 B vs. E \u2192 A ). The infected tourists from city A can spread infection to city B . Tourists from city E are probably infected when they travel to city A and then take the virus back to city E , thereby spreading infection. The infection spread curves under both conditions are almost the same. When the time step is small, we can consider the percentage of the infected individuals in city A 's tourist population who travel to city B and in city E 's tourist population who return to their home cities from city A to be the same. The population exchange rate between cities A and B during each time step equals that between cities E and A ( \u03b4 AB = \u03b4 EA ). Therefore, the infectious disease transmission curves of cities B and E are similar. This pattern can also be seen by comparing the results of cities C and D .",

As shown in Fig. 6 (c) , when tourists who enter city C are monitored, the outbreak occurrence time in city C is the same as that under the condition of city A exit surveillance.

When infected tourists return from city C to city B , 90% of them are sent to hospital for isolation. Only 10% of infected tourists can take the virus back, strongly weakening the efficiency of infection spread. City C acts as a filter and reduces the impacts caused by infected city B 's tourists who return from city C . Infected residents in city D are never monitored because none of city D 's tourists go to city C, but a few infected tourists do go to city D from city C . In general, as a hub city, city-entry surveillance is not only useful to city C , but also to cities with a high rate of population exchange with city C . Fig. 6 (d) shows the infection spread under hub city C exit surveillance. Infected tourists leaving source city A cannot be monitored. Compared to city C entry surveillance, the outbreak occurrence time in cities B, C, D and E is advanced in city C exit surveillance. For city B , city C acts as a filter regardless of which of the two strategies is chosen. Therefore, the impact on city B is the same.

In reality, when the severity of infectious disease increases, travel rate is likely to decrease. Comparing Figs. 7 (a) and 6 (f), when travel rate decreases as infection severity increases, the efficiency of infectious disease control is limited because human mobility in cities is not controlled. However, the outbreak occurrence time is delayed in downstream cities. For example, the outbreak occurrence time in city C is delayed by 5 days, in city B by 12 days and in cities D and E by 15.4 days. This strategy cannot reduce the severity of outbreaks, but it can delay the outbreak occurrence time. This gives the government more time to make emergency plans. The local government usually requests individuals to avoid densely populated areas, such as shopping malls, to reduce the number of person-to-person contacts per day during infection outbreaks ( Fig. 7 (b) ). When infectious disease is very serious, some strategies, such as work stoppage, school closure and shopping mall closure, are implemented. In this situation, the probability of person-to-person contact is decreased. Even the probability of tourists spreading infection or becoming infected decreases. The severity of infectious disease outbreak is strongly reduced and the peak value of the infected population in all cities is controlled below 7.7%.",

Moreover, the higher R 0 is, the higher the travel rate must be to reach the highest P c d c s . With an increasing travel rate, the P c d c s increases first then goes down. For example, if there is only one infected traveller going to the downstream city and only one resident in the downstream city is infected (travel rate \u2192 0), the trend of the number of the infected would be the same for both the source and the downstream cities (all of them are caused by only one infected person), and there is no difference between the peak value of the infected ( P c d c s == 0).

However, the travel rate rapidly increases when certain festivals, such as the Spring Festival (the most important festival in China), arrive.

For infectious diseases with low transfer rate ( \u03b2\u2193 ) but a high infectious period ( \u03b3 \u2193 ), downstream cities are strongly influenced by the associated source city ( P c d c s \u2191 ). When the infectious period increases, there is a longer time to spread disease when tourists from the source city travel to downstream cities. The severity of infection in downstream cities is strengthened. In addition, under a travel rate of 1%, with increasing travel duration (from 1 to 7 days), the population exchange rate between two cities reduces and the impacts of the source city on downstream cities weaken. In reality, the average travel duration is decided by vacation arrangements. For example, only 1-2 days of travel can occur on weekends, but the average travel duration can be between 5 and 7 days when the Spring Festival or National Day arrives. We find that when the quotient of travel duration ( t T ) and travel rate ( \u03b4) is a constant ( t T /\u03b4 = 50 in this study), P c d c s reaches a maximum. Governments may consider different emergency plans based on the characteristics of travel patterns. P c d c s reaches a maximum of 4.40% when the travel rate is 4.0% and the travel duration is 2.66 days. The increased severity of the downstream city is slight. In reality, this influence is ignored because it is easily covered by other impacts caused by environmental differences (e.g., temperature and humidity), cultural differences and individual characteristics between cities. Our results are obtained for the same settings in all cities.",

P c e c s is not strongly related to the total number of cities. In general, travel-related factors influence infection spread between cities, but the impacts are limited. In the study, we found that the infection enhancement in downstream cities brought by travel is much weaker than those by some environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. Normally, travel can only bring no more than 4% infection enhancement in downstream cities and the impact is relatively low compared with environment factors. However, downstream cities should be paid more attention because infection intensity in downstream cities is no weaker than the source city.",

Our simulation shows that the severity of infectious disease transmission is difficult to control if only tourist surveillance between cities is used. This strategy can help delay the outbreak occurrence time and provide governments more time to prepare efficient emergency plans. City-entry surveillance of non-hub cities is only useful to the target city that measures tourist surveillance. The positive impacts on other cities can be ignored. City-entry surveillance of hub cities is not only useful to the hub cities, but also to cities with strong connections (i.e., a high travel rate) to them. However, for cities with little or no tourist exchange with hub cities, the positive impacts of hub city entry surveillance are weak. The cityexit surveillance of hub cities contributes to downstream cities, but only slightly to above said hub cities. Both the city-entry andexit surveillance of hub cities are the most effective for infection control, although requiring more manpower and consuming more resources. Tourist surveillance of hub cities is much more efficient than of other cities and can provide local governments more time to prepare emergency plans to reduce the threat of infectious disease.",

Strengthening the individual immunity of either frequent travellers or randomly selected individuals yields little difference. The efficiency of strategies that only improve the individual immunity of frequent travellers is limited. However, the outbreak occurrence time can be slightly delayed in downstream cities. Individuals can either wear a mask or get vaccinated to reduce infection risk. Governments can limit the travel rate between cities and the probability of person-to-person contact via work stoppage ( Zhang et al., 2018a ) and school closure ( Gemmetto et al., 2014 ) to reduce infection risk. Comparing the two government strategies, controlling the amount of person-to-person contact per day is obviously effective in infectious disease control.",
