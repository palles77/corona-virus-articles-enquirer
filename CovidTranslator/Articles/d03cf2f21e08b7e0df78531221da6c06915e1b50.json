            "text": "Purpose: Receiving influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses, a phenomenon known as virus interference. Test-negative study designs are often utilized to calculate influenza vaccine effectiveness. The virus interference phenomenon goes against the basic assumption of the test-negative vaccine effectiveness study that vaccination does not change the risk of infection with other respiratory illness, thus potentially biasing vaccine effectiveness results in the positive direction. This study aimed to investigate virus interference by comparing respiratory virus status among Department of Defense personnel based on their influenza vaccination status. Furthermore, individual respiratory viruses and their association with influenza vaccination were examined. Results: We compared vaccination status of 2880 people with non-influenza respiratory viruses to 3240 people with pan-negative results. Comparing vaccinated to non-vaccinated patients, the adjusted odds ratio for non-flu viruses was 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86, 1.09; p = 0.60). Additionally, the vaccination status of 3349 cases of influenza were compared to three different control groups: all controls (N = 6120), non-influenza positive controls (N = 2880), and pan-negative controls (N = 3240). The adjusted ORs for the comparisons among the three control groups did not vary much (range: 0.46-0.51). Conclusions: Receipt of influenza vaccination was not associated with virus interference among our population. Examining virus interference by specific respiratory viruses showed mixed results. Vaccine derived virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus and human metapneumovirus; however, significant protection with vaccination was associated not only with most influenza viruses, but also parainfluenza, RSV, and non-influenza virus coinfections.",

            "text": "The Department of Defense Global Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance Program (DoDGRS) is a DoD-wide program established by the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (GEIS). The program was founded in 1997 as an influenza-only surveillance program. In the 2013-2014 influenza season the program added respiratory Film Array for flu negative samples and began identifying other respiratory pathogens. Starting in the 2017-2018 influenza season, the program added Luminex Film Array capabilities to test for respiratory pathogens, and became known as DoDGRS. The Defense Health Agency/Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch -Air Force Satellite Cell (DHA/ AFHSB -AF) and United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) manage the surveillance program that includes global surveillance among DoD beneficiaries at 79 sentinel sites (including deployed locations) and many non-sentinel sites. Laboratory testing completed at USAFSAM and Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) included multiplex PCR respiratory pathogen panels (including: adenovirus, Chlmydia pneumoniae, coronavirus, human bocavirus, human metapnumovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus/enterovirus, and co-infections) [14, 15] , viral culture detecting influenza and other respiratory viruses, and influenza A/B subtyping via PCR [16, 17] . Vaccination status was derived from both the Air Force Complete Immunization Tracking Application (AFCITA), a United States Air Force database containing vaccination-related data, and from surveys given to those submitting respiratory samples. If the patient had an influenza vaccination record in AFCITA for the 2017-2018 influenza season, or answered yes to being vaccinated during the season on their survey, they were identified as vaccinated. Patients who were not vaccinated for the season or who were vaccinated less than 14 days prior to specimen submittal were classified as unvaccinated.",

Basic descriptive epidemiology was utilized to obtain counts and rates of outcomes by sex, military beneficiary category, age group, disease status, seasonality of illness, and vaccination status. In order to determine if virus interference was associated with influenza vaccination in the military beneficiary population, odds ratios and confidence intervals were calculated utilizing conditional logistic regression to compare vaccination status from two analyses. First, those with a viral respiratory illness other than influenza were compared to those with no pathogen detected (pan-negative). Next influenza positive cases were compared to three different control groups. The first control group was comprised of all controls, specifically, individuals testing negative for flu or positive for any respiratory virus other than flu. The second control group consisted of only those who were positive for respiratory viruses other than influenza. Lastly, pan-negative controls were compared to influenza cases. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were calculated for the overall population, the population with AFCITA records only, and the active duty only population during the influenza season for the comparison of other respiratory illnesses to pan-negatives, as well as all three case-control comparisons. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated after modeling variables in a nested logistic regression, keeping all variables with p < 0.20 and then adding them to a full logistic model. In the full logistic model, only variables that remained significant were included in the final adjusted model. Age group remained significant in the overall population; age group and seasonality remained significant in the AFCITA confirmed vaccination group and the Active Duty population; and gender, age group, and seasonality all remained significant in all three of the case-control comparisons. Those respective variables that remained significant were included in the adjustment for the odds ratio for the total season. Individual respiratory virus outcomes were also examined and stratified by vaccination status. Odds ratios, confidence intervals, and p-values were calculated to determine if individual respiratory viruses were associated with influenza vaccination.",

One study in the United States found similar results [12] . The study found influenza vaccination was not associated with detection of non-influenza respiratory viruses [12] . Additionally, the laboratory data in our study showed increased odds of coronavirus and human metapneumovirus in individuals receiving influenza vaccination. The study finding similar results to our study found no association between influenza vaccination and RSV, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus or coronavirus [12] . The same study did find a significant association between parainfluenza and influenza vaccination, but the association was in opposite directions when comparing children and adults [12] . In our disease specific investigation, virus interference trends were noticed for coronavirus and human metapneumovirus; however, two specific respiratory viruses (parainfluenza and RSV) showed significant protection associated with influenza vaccine receipt, and all others tested (adenovirus, human bocavirus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus) showed protection, although non-significant, associated with vaccination (Table 5) . Additional examination of virus interference was accomplished by assessing the affect that three non-influenza control groups had on vaccine effectiveness (N = 9469). The adjusted ORs for the three groups ranged from 0.46 to 0.51, having similar 95% confidence intervals, and accounting for a difference of 5% in vaccine effectiveness. The minute differences among the vaccine effectiveness of all three control groups does not support the virus interference concept.",

This type of study recruits subjects who have influenza-like illness, collects a respiratory specimen, performs diagnostic laboratory testing to determine the pathogen, and obtains the individual's vaccination status [18] [19] [20] [21] . The vaccine-associated virus interference phenomenon goes against the basic assumption of the test-negative vaccine effectiveness study, that is, vaccination does not change the risk of infection with other respiratory illness. The results of this study do not support a potential for bias in test-negative influenza vaccine effectiveness studies. In a test-negative study design, patients must be sick with influenza-like illness. Since the population must be ill, if the vaccinated population is more likely to have other respiratory viruses when compared to the non-vaccinated population, then in turn they are less likely to have influenza. Bias introduced in these studies may cause an overestimate of vaccine effectiveness. Mandatory influenza vaccination is required for all Active Duty personnel [13] . As such, vaccination effectiveness studies examining strictly Active Duty military members have previously shown to be methodologically invalid and often times have uninterpretable results [22, 23] . In order to examine potential issues with mandatory vaccination, beneficiary category was included in the logistic regression model. While beneficiary category did not remain significant, and was therefore not kept in the final logistic model, Active Duty members were then separated from the rest of the population and virus interference among this population was calculated. Both the unadjusted and adjusted models did not show significant evidence of virus interference in Active Duty members; therefore, this large portion of the population does not appear to be skewing study results converse to the aforementioned vaccine effectiveness studies.",

Further research is necessary to help character virus interference and validate or refute the validity of the test-negative design for influenza vaccine effectiveness.",
