Vaccine antigens are composed of antigenic proteins and are devoid of pathogenic genes, so cannot establish infection (Strugnell et al. 2011) . Vaccine antigens can be produced using a variety of host expression systems, including genetically engineered bacterial, yeast, mammalian and plant cells. Plants are attractive expression vehicles for commercial production of vaccine antigens. Plant-based vaccines hold great promise as they are cost-effective, easy-to-administer, easy-to-store, fail-safe and acceptable, particularly in developing countries (Lal et al. 2007; Sala et al. 2003) . Novel approaches to improve the yield and biosafety of plantbased vaccines have been proposed (Hern\u00e1ndez et al. 2014) . Agroinfiltration is a simple, efficient and robust method for transient protein expression .",

PEDV BamHI restriction site at the 5\u2032-end and KpnI at the 3\u2032-end of the sequence was included to facilitate cloning.

A BamHI restriction site at the 5\u2032-end and KpnI at the 3\u2032-end of the sequence was included to facilitate cloning.

Gene identity was confirmed via sequencing using the universal primers T7 and SP6. The BamHI and KpnI-digested fragment containing the S1D gene from pMYV711 was introduced into the same sites of the E. coli expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), yielding pMYV714. The plasmid was confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping. Plasmid pMYV714 was transformed into E. coli expression host disrupts villus enterocytes and causes villi atrophy within the jejunum and ileum, leading to a mortality rate of up to 95 % in infected suckling pigs (Ducatelle et al. 1981) . PED was first detected in Belgium (Pensaert and de Bouck 1978) and the UK (Chasey and Cartwright 1978) , and was designated CV777.

The complete sequence of the genome of strain CV777 was found to be 28,033 nucleotides in length, excluding the poly A-tail (K ocherhans et al. 2001) . The large spike glycoprotein peplomer (S), one of four structural proteins, stimulates production of neutralizing antibodies in the host. The predicted S polypeptide is 1383 amino acids long, contains 29 potential N-linked glycosylation sites and shows structural features similar to those of the coronavirus spike protein (Duarte and Laude 1994) . The PEDV S protein can be divided into the S1 domain (aa 1-789) and S2 domain (aa 790-1383) based on the presence of the conserved nonamer and GxCx motifs at the proteolytic cleavage site of the S protein of other members of coronavirus group II (Follis et al. 2006) . Within the S1 domain, two important epitope domains were determined. The first domain is the PEDV-neutralizing epitope (CO-26 K equivalent, COE gene), which is 139 aa long and spans the region aa 499-638 (Chang et al. 2002) . Sun et al. identified the second epitope domain, designated S1D (aa 636-789), and reported that it induces neutralizing antibodies (Sun et al. 2008) . In this study, the S1D gene alone, and that fused with the cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) gene of Vibrio cholerae, were cloned into plant expression vectors. These vectors were transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana (N. bentham iana) using agroinfiltration. The proteins were orally administered to mice to induce specific immune responses.",

To determine the levels of anti-CTB and anti-S1D antibodies, sera and fecal extracts were subjected to ELISA. The anti-CTB The biological activity of CTB-S1D fusion protein with the intestinal membrane G M1 -ganglioside receptor was confirmed using an anti-cholera toxin antibody (a) and anti-S1D antibody (b) transiently co-expressed proteins (Mohammadzadeh et al. 2015; Voinnet et al. 2003) . The S1D and CTB-S1D protein levels were enhanced from fourfold to sevenfold in the presence of p19 (Figs. 3, 4) , respectively. Moreover, accumulation of the CTB-S1D fusion protein was fourfold greater than that of the S1D protein (Fig. 4) . The CTB portion plays a role in enhancing protein accumulation and as a mucosal adjuvant and carrier. In previous studies, the expression level of synthetic COE-Co1 was 0.083 % of TSP in transgenic rice under the control of the strong RAmy3D promoter at day 3 after induction in sucrose starvation medium (Huy et al. 2012) . The highest expression level of CTB-COE fusion protein was 0.0065 % of TSP in transgenic lettuce plants (Huy et al. 2011) . By performing transient expression in the presence of p19, the expression levels of S1D protein and CTB-S1D fusion protein were 2-and 75-fold higher than those of COE-Co1 and CTB-COE in transgenic plants. The increased protein expression levels might result in elicitation of strong immune responses and prevent induction of immune tolerance by plant-based oral vaccines. The binding of functional CTB-S1D fusion protein to its biological receptor, G M1 -ganglioside, was confirmed by G M1 -ELISA with anti-CT and anti-S1D antibodies (Fig. 4) . These results indicated that the S1D protein of the CTB-S1D fusion protein was assembled into functional oligomeric structures and retained its antigenicity.",

To optimize S1D expression, the gene was added to various expression vectors, including the Agrobacterium vector pTRAC (Maclean et al. 2007 ), a viral pro-vector (Marillonnet et al. 2004 ) and a binary vector. The target protein was expressed at a high level using the binary vector. However, the level of protein production was low (Figs. 3a, 4a) , as it was limited by the PTGS factor.

Results are mean OD (405 nm) values of five immunized mice. Error bars represent standard deviations.

Different letters within a column indicate significant differences (P \u2264 0.05) according to Tukey's test ground, and the expression of assembled CTB-S1D fusion protein was confirmed before oral administration to female BALB/c mice for 6 weeks at a 1-week interval (Fig. 6b) . Mice given the CTB-S1D fusion protein exhibited CTBand S1D-specific systemic IgG at week 4. The IgG and sIgA levels were significantly increased at week 6 ( Fig. 7a-d) . CT acts not only as a mucosal immunogen and mucosal adjuvant but also as induces immune responses to unrelated nasally and orally co-administered antigens (Elson and Ealding 1984; Isaka et al. 2004 ). The CT61F mutant, which lacks ADP-ribosylation activity but retains the mucosal adjuvant properties of native CT, was expressed in rice callus (unpublished paper). To enhance the immune responses, transiently expressed CTB-S1D was co-gavaged with bCT and rCTX into mice at appropriate doses (Fig. 6a) . As expected, anti-CTB and anti-S1D Ab levels, in mice given CTB-S1D with bCT and with rCTX at 6 weeks ( Fig. 7a, b) , were significantly higher than those of mice fed CTB-S1D only. sIgA is the predominant antibody class in external secretions and the major humoral defense factor that prevents colonization of mucosal surfaces by infective agents, such as bacteria and viruses (Haan et al. 1995; Woof and Mestecky 2005) . This sIgA may thus prevent PED. The levels of S1D-specific sIgA responses were significantly greater than those in the control group. The anti-S1D antibody levels in mice given CTB-S1D and bCT were significantly increased in comparison with those fed CTB-S1D only (Fig. 7d) . The transient expression of CTB-S1D fusion protein thus induced S1Dspecific systemic and mucosal immune responses following oral administration to mice. bCT and rCTX enhanced S1Dspecific antibody responses when orally co-administered with CTB-S1D protein.",
