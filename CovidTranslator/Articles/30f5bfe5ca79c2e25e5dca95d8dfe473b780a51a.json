There are two strategies aimed at the expression of a vaccine antigen by adenoviral vectors. The first includes an insertion of the foreign gene expression cassette into the E1 region. The second strategy is antigen incorporation into the viral capsid proteins. To extend this methodology, we have searched for new sites at the human adenovirus serotype 5 major capsid protein hexon for a vaccine antigen insertion. To this end, we utilized sites in the hexon hypervariable region (HVR) 7, 8 and 9 to display a 15-mer peptide containing the main neutralizing epitope of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. However, we could not rescue the viruses with the insertions of the peptide into HVR 8 and 9, consistent with the viruses being unable to tolerate insertions at these sites. In contrast, the virus with the insertion of the peptide in HVR 7 was viable -growing well in cell culture and the inserted peptide was exposed on the virion surface.",

The replication-defective (E1-deleted) and replication-competent (E3-deleted) hAd5 have both been used as vaccine delivery vectors. For biosafety concerns, a replication-defective hAd5 is considered to be more suitable for vaccination. Replication-defective vectors may also have deletion in the E3 region to increase the amount of foreign DNA that can be inserted. Conventional strategy for the expression of a vaccine antigen by adenoviral vector includes insertion of the foreign gene expression cassette into the E1 region. This antigen is expressed as transgene after the infection of permissive cells with recombinant adenovirus.",

To overcome such hurdles, the \"antigen capsid-incorporation\" strategy was developed [4] . Incorporating an immunogenic peptide into the hAd5 capsid offers several potential advantages. Importantly, the processing of capsid-incorporated antigen via the exogenous pathway could result in a strong humoral response, similar to that generated by native hAd5 capsid proteins, and this strategy may also be useful in boosting antigen-specific antibody immune responses.",

First, a 1 kb fragment was amplified using primers BL7F1 and Nhe-R, and pUC-Ad5-hex as a template. Second, a 1 kb fragment was amplified using primers BLF2 and Nhe-R, and the product of PCR 1 as a template.
