Age-standardised YLLs in China were lower in 2010 than all emerging economies in the G20, and only slightly higher than noted in the USA. China had the lowest age-standardised YLD rate in the G20 in 2010. China also ranked tenth (95% UI eighth to tenth) for HALE and 12th (11th to 13th) for life expectancy. YLLs from neonatal causes, infectious diseases, and injuries in children declined substantially between 1990 and 2010. Mental and behavioural disorders, substance use disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders were responsible for almost half of all YLDs. The fraction of DALYs from YLDs rose from 28\u00b71% (95% UI 24\u00b72-32\u00b75) in 1990 to 39\u00b74% (34\u00b79-43\u00b78) in 2010. Leading causes of DALYs in 2010 were cardiovascular diseases (stroke and ischaemic heart disease), cancers (lung and liver cancer), low back pain, and depression. Dietary risk factors, high blood pressure, and tobacco exposure are the risk factors that constituted the largest number of attributable DALYs in China. Ambient air pollution ranked fourth (third to fi fth; the second highest in the G20) and household air pollution ranked fi fth (fourth to sixth; the third highest in the G20) in terms of the age-standardised DALY rate in 2010.",

Reduction of population exposures from poor diet, high blood pressure, tobacco use, cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose are public policy priorities for China, as are the control of ambient and household air pollution. These changes will require an integrated government response to improve primary care and undertake required multisectoral action to tackle key risks. Analyses of disease burden provide a useful framework to guide policy responses to the changing disease spectrum in China.",

Some counties within the country, however, remain relatively poor and continue to have a set of health challenges dominated by communicable, maternal, and neonatal causes. 3, 4 China needs to understand and formulate a long-range strategy to tackle several challenges in public health and medical care at the same time.",

YLLs are computed by multiplying the number of deaths in each age group by a reference life expectancy at that age. The life expectancy at birth in the reference life table is 86\u00b70 years based on the lowest reported death rates for each age group across countries in 2010, and is intended to represent an achievable pattern of mortality. 26 Years lived with disability are calculated from the prevalence of a sequela multiplied by the disability weight for that sequela. Disability weights are based on surveys of the general population. 27 DALYs are the sum of YLLs and YLDs. The GBD uses another indicator, healthy life expectancy (HALE), to summarise overall population health in one number, accounting for both length of life and levels of ill health at diff erent ages. 28",

[47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] The eff ects of treatment depending on the cause are captured through changes in prevalence, changes in the severity distribution across sequelae (eg, for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and for some injuries diff erent disability weights for treated and untreated outcomes. Access to treatment for injuries is estimated on the basis of an indicator of access to health systems. 29 For GBD 2010, disability weights were measured for 220 unique health states that cover the 1160 disease and injury sequelae. 27 Disability weights were generated from more than 30 000 respondents collected through population-based surveys in fi ve countries-USA, Peru, Tanzania, Bangladesh, and Indonesia-and an open internet survey. 271 respondents of the internet survey were from China. Uncertainty in the disability weight for each sequela has been propagated into the estimates of YLDs for each disease and injury. We combined information about age-specifi c mortality rates, and about overall age-specifi c YLDs per person into the overall measure of health expectancy, HALE, using a standard approach to extending the life table to capture adjustments for non-fatal health outcomes. 28",

During this period, the main causes of child mortality also changed. The top fi ve specifi c causes, accounting for 59\u00b77% (51\u00b77-69\u00b71) of child deaths in 2010 were (in order of frequency) congenital anomalies, preterm birth complications, lower respiratory infections, neonatal encephalopathy, and drowning. Diarrhoeal diseases were ranked sixth (95% UI fi fth to seventh) in 1990 but accounted for 0\u00b79% (95% UI 0\u00b76-1\u00b73) of child deaths in 2010, and measles were ranked seventh (sixth to 13th) in 1990 but accounted for 0\u00b72% (95% UI <0\u00b705-0\u00b74) of child deaths in 2010. Figure 2 shows the striking transition in YLLs that took place in China between 1990 and 2010. The number of YLLs attributable to neonatal causes, diarrhoea, pneumonia, and other infectious causes and injuries in children declined profoundly in this period. At the same time, a shift occurred towards a large number of cardiovascular and cancer YLLs at older ages with a notable peak in cancer YLLs in the 55-59 year age group in 2010. The number, age pattern, and composition of injury YLLs also changed: we noted increases and shifts to older ages in transport injuries and large declines in intentional injuries. Figure 3 shows the transition in leading causes of YLLs from 1990 to 2010. We noted striking declines in major communicable and neonatal causes of premature mortality: lower respiratory infections moved from fi rst (95% UI fi rst to third) to ninth (eighth to 11th); neonatal encephalopathy dropped 14 ranks (sixth to 20th); preterm birth complications dropped ten ranks (ninth to 19th); a 77% (95% UI 72-84) decline in YLLs from tuberculosis led it to drop from 15th (13th to 16th) to 29th (26th to 35th); and diarrhoea and meningitis also had substantial improvements. YLLs from stroke, ischaemic heart disease, road injury, lung cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, and diabetes increased. Although population ageing was a key driver of these increases, age-standardised YLL rates (data not shown) for ischaemic heart disease, road injury, lung cancer, and diabetes also increased between 1990 and 2010. Several disorders that did not increase in incidence remained leading causes of YLLs in 2010: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stomach cancer, selfharm, oesophageal cancer, drowning, falls, and congenital anoma lies. The substantial decrease we noted in premature mortality from drowning deserves note. Incidence of HIV/AIDS increased strikingly in the 20-year period to become the 23rd biggest cause (20th to 29th) of YLLs. Figure 4 shows the levels of premature mortality in China relative to other members of the G20 in 2010. For men in China in 2010, age-standardised rates of years of life lost due to ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, cirrhosis, diabetes, preterm birth complications, chronic kidney diseases, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis were signifi cantly better than the G20 mean. China had signifi cantly worse ranks than the mean for stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver cancer, stomach cancer, oesophageal cancer, leukaemia, drowning, and falls. The YLL rates of road injury and lung cancer for 2010 are indistinguishable from the mean but the absolute increase in YLLs from these causes is concerning. For women in China, we noted better than G20 average performance on ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, diabetes, breast cancer, preterm birth complications, chronic kidney diseases, cervical cancer, cirrhosis, and cardiovascular and circulatory diseases. We noted worse than G20 average outcomes for stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, road injury, self-harm, liver cancer, stomach cancer, oesoph ageal cancer, falls, drowning, and rheumatic heart disease. Even for conditions such as ischaemic heart disease, lung cancer, and diabetes (for which China was better than average in the G20 in 2010), rising rates suggest that this status might change in the near future.",

Other important causes included diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine causes; other non-communicable diseases, which includes vision loss, hearing loss, and skin diseases; and unintentional injuries, which includes falls. Although age-specifi c YLDs per head rise with age, the eff ect of population age-structure leads to 77\u00b72% (76\u00b75-78\u00b70) of YLDs occurring before age 60 years in China. Figure 6 compares the leading causes of YLDs in 1990 and 2010. The top 11 causes of YLDs all increased in terms of the absolute numbers of YLDs. Of the top ten causes of disability in 2010, four were musculoskeletal China ranked among the G20 as having the fi fth lowest age-standardised rate of major de pression. Diabetes, falls, chronic obstruc tive pulmonary disease, and hearing loss constituted the other top ten causes of YLDs. Progress on tackling com muni cable diseases was also evident in the analysis of YLDs. We noted substantial declines (>30\u00b70%) for iron-defi ciency anaemia, hookworm, tuberculosis, and ascariasis. Putting premature mortality and disability together in terms of DALYs provides an overall picture of the leading health problems in China. Table 4 shows the number and rate of DALYs in 1990 and 2010 and the percentage change between 1990 and 2010. The top ten causes have prominent roles for cardiovascular disorders (stroke and ischaemic heart disease) and cancers (lung and liver). Two disorders that largely cause disability, low back pain and major depression, are also leading causes of DALYs. Four other disorders make up the top ten: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, road injuries, and falls, which all make up an important component of premature mortality and disability.",

Chinese women had increased rates of DALYs caused by stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, road injury, self-harm, liver cancer, and stomach cancer. For some of the leading causes of disability, including low back pain and neck pain, China had rates that are indistinguishable from the G20 mean. Comparing 1990 (data not shown) with 2010, eight causes switched from signifi cantly better than average to indistinguishable from average: falls, congenital anomalies, neonatal encephalopathy, poison ings, rheumatic heart disease, hookworm, ascariasis, and cysticercosis. For ischaemic heart disease, road injury and lung cancer (for which China was below the G20 average in 2010), rising rates mean that this situation might soon change. ",

The contribution of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders to DALYs declined for all ages from nearly 27% in 1990 to about 10% in 2010. The burden of disease is now dominated by cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, road injuries, and key causes of chronic disabilities such as mental and musculoskeletal disorders. Although the burden of suicide, drowning, and many injuries declined, the burden of road injuries and falls is increasing. The rise of non-communicable diseases and chronic disability is fuelled by a shift away from risks for communicable diseases in children toward those for non-communicable diseases in adults. The one child policy in China implies the demographic shifts contributing to this rapid transition in health problems will intensify in the coming decades. China has had remarkable success in decreasing death rates and disability from communicable diseases. Deaths from diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections in children younger than 5 years declined by 90% in the two decades from 1990. DALYs caused by tuberculosis dropped by about 71%. We also noted large declines for incidence of infection with intestinal nematodes, meningitis, tetanus, measles, and diarrhoea. The speed of some of these declines provides a model for other developing countries. Communicable disease-control challenges, however, are not over. The burden of HIV increased between 1990 and 2010 (table 2) . 213 000 (95% UI 179 600-260 700) children younger than 5 years died in 2010, almost 60% of them from communicable, neonatal, and nutritional causes. Subnational assess ments would probably reveal that the burden of communicable diseases is high in some poor provinces. China faces challenges dealing with the ongoing risk of pandemic infl uenza. The 2013 outbreak of H7N9 shows how the interaction between animal and human populations continues to lead to new epidemics. Through the internet-based surveillance system run by the Chinese CDC, early detection of the fi rst human cases of H7N9 led to a coherent response. Despite progress, continued attention to the unfi nished agenda for communicable disease control is required and ongoing epidemic surveillance and response is a necessity.",

            "text": "The burden of diseases attributable to individual behaviours and practices is steadily rising. The most important behaviours included diets low in fruit, high in sodium and low in whole grains, smoking, alcohol, and physical inactivity. Smoking prevalence in China for men is 52\u00b79% (one of the highest rates in the world) and for women is 2\u00b74% (one of the lowest), 55 and second-hand smoke exposure is as high as 72\u00b74%. 23, 56 The fraction of deaths attributable to tobacco increased from 12\u00b78% (9\u00b79-16\u00b79) in 1990 to 16\u00b74% (12\u00b78-19\u00b79) in 2010 (appendix p 10) and will increase because of the lag between consumption and death rates. The aggregation of 14 components of diet was the leading risk factor for DALYs in China, including the consumption of sodium and inadequate intake of fruit, whole grains, and nuts and seeds. Reliable data from the national nutrition surveys show that even rural Chinese diets dominated by rice are low in fruit, high in sodium, low in whole grains, and low in nuts and seeds. Rising incomes and a larger fraction of the population living to older ages mean that the burden attributable to these behaviours will increase. The extraordinary pace of urbanisation in China might exacerbate this trans formation. The urban population in China has more than tripled in the past 30 years and the rate of urbanisation is accelerating. 57, 58 Although urbanisation off ers opportunities for improvements in population health in China (such as access to improved health care and basic infrastructure), it also can lead to substantial health risks including ambient air pollution, occupational and traffi c hazards, and poor diet and little physical activity. Associated social and economic challenges will accompany these shifts. For example, the ratio of the population older than 65 years to the workingaged population (aged 20-64 years) was 0\u00b7127 in 2010 and is expected to rise to 0\u00b7184 in 2020 and 0\u00b726 in 2030. 2 The physical environment is an important driver of health in China. High levels of PM2\u00b75, particularly in eastern China, have made ambient air pollution the fourth leading risk factor for DALYs. 59 Use of solid fuels-in particular coal in inadequately ventilated homes-also contributes to excess mortality. 59 Policies to change the physical layout of the road system and vehicle safety equipment might need to be enacted to restrict the burden of road injuries. 59 Physical activity might also be infl uenced by urban layout. Actions to address the physical environment, however, are far beyond the scope of the National Health and Family Planning Commission. Addressing these new and substantial risks to Chinese health will require multisectorial action at national, provincial, and local levels. Such action will need careful documentation of the health harms at a local level and the potential for aff ordable alternative policies to reduce these harms.",

Incidence of health loss and health-care costs from mental disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, and vision and hearing loss will steadily rise. China needs to plan for how the health system can prevent and manage these disorders cost-eff ectively. Along with Japan, South Korea, and Mexico, China seems to benefi t from lower rates of major depression, anxiety disorders, and low back pain than do other members of the G20. This fi nding, however, has been challenged; true rates might be higher. 36 Our fi ndings on these rates are based on the careful assessment of all the available evidence; resolution will require more in-depth research on the potential for reporting biases in China and other countries in east Asia. The rise of chronic disability also has implications for the types of health workers China will need in the next 10-20 years; disciplines such as psychiatry, rheuma tology, rehabilitation medicine, audiology, and ophthal mology might need increased investment. The recent adoption of China's fi rst mental health law is a positive development in this area. The key obstacle China confronts in strengthening its public health and primary health care is a shortage of human resources. Although the Chinese Government has identifi ed the training of family doctors as a top priority 60 (and plans to train 300 000 of them in the next 10 years), these targets seem challenging to reach. Retention of qualifi ed health professionals in rural areas, especially in poor regions, has been diffi cult.",

Of these cancers, the burden of lung, liver, and colorectal cancers increased between 1990 and 2010. China also has worse than G20 average rates for these cancers and oesophageal cancer. What are the policy options for China to address this unusually high burden of selected cancers? Tobacco and diet can account for important shares of stomach, colorectal, and lung cancers. Aggressive tobacco control and national eff orts to encourage changes in diet will be important. Hepatitis B is related to 54\u00b72% (95% UI 49\u00b75-58\u00b78) of the increasing burden of liver cancer; immunisation programmes will lead eventually to reductions but, because the median age of liver cancer burden is 55 years, several decades will need to pass before the eff ect of vaccination can substantially reduce the burden of this cancer. Benefi ts from screening and treatment for colorectal cancer 61 should be assessed as to whether they are cost eff ective for China. Access to improved screening and treatment might also lead to improved outcomes for other cancers such as breast and cervical cancers.",

Age-standardised rates for ischaemic heart disease increased between 1990 and 2010, although stroke rates in China were relatively constant. Increased blood pressure is the second leading risk factor in China ahead of tobacco consumption. Increased fasting plasma glucose and total cholesterol are also important risks of DALYs. Public health programmes to reduce tobacco consumption, sodium intake, and change other dietary risks are clearly important strategies for tackling of cardiovascular diseases in China. Primary care can also be a platform for delivery of interventions such as the detection and pharmacological management of raised blood pressure and cholesterol, and screening and management of diabetes, and impaired glucose tolerance. Because of China's hospital-centred health system, strengthening primary care to handle these and other problems will require a shift in policy focus. The massive declines in rates of death from ischaemic heart disease in many high-income countries have also been attributable to improved management of acute cardiac events and post-event care.

Eff ective policies will need to be multisectorial, engaging other sectors such as employment, income maintenance, social welfare, housing, education, and the mass media.

The results have the same limitations as GBD 2010. 1, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] In GBD 2010, no data existed for some of the 1160 disabling sequelae for some or even many of the countries. Results have been informed by several data sources available for China but for some disorders the data are weak or absent (eg, autism, cannabis dependence, endometriosis, and genital prolapse). In other cases, substantial diff erences exist between the available data sources (eg, for some cancers the cause of death data and population-based cancer registry data are inconsistent in some age groups). The reporting of UIs provides the reader with some information on the extent of the information available for China. Uncertainty could, for various reasons such as unrecognised bias in published studies, still be under estimated. The analysis of risk factors has focused on proximal and behavioural risks. The important role of social determinants 67 was not quantifi ed in the GBD 2010 because of a dearth of available data and suffi cient evidence. The assessment of YLDs depends crucially on the validity of the disability weights measured by Salomon and colleagues. 27 Although investigation across several countries reported no evidence of systematic diff er ences; disability weights obtained in a national survey in China could be diff erent from other countries. 68, 69 Most importantly, a national analysis for a country as large and diverse as China could mask substantial variations in key outcomes. For example, the HIV epidemic is very concentrated in some provinces. 70, 71 The rapid transition towards non-communicable diseases and disability is probably more advanced in eastern provinces. In view of improvements in some data systems in the previous decade, the possibility of bias exists in the measurement of some diseases overtime. We believe that the substantial eff orts to correct for these biases that are part of the GBD method minimises this possibility.",

Development of a complete national vital events registration system with certifi cation of cause of death would strikingly aid in this endeavour. In the previous 2 years alone, a rapid expansion has occurred in coverage of cause of death certifi cation so that more than half of all deaths were captured in 2012. The national internet case reporting system can provide local level detail on 39 diseases since 2004. Several national surveys are underway or planned with large sample sizes. Ensuring that the various surveillance systems and topic-specifi c national surveys ultimately combine to provide a coherent picture of the prevalence of major diseases, injuries, and risk factors at the provincial level will also reduce the role of statistical estimation in generating burden of disease results. Robust annual assessments of the burden will provide China with a powerful method to benchmark progress against developed and other rapidly developing nations and assess where investments and policy action have been eff ective. Setting priorities for the health system, however, will also need information on the costs and consequences of diff erent policy options, a better under standing of health inequalities and the capacity of the health system to implement change that is both effi cient and fair.",
