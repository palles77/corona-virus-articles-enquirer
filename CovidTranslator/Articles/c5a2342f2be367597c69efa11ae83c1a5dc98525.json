            "text": "This paper reports on a study of the ways in which 54 older people in South Wales (UK) talk about the symptoms and causes of cold and influenza (flu). The study was designed to understand why older people might reject or accept the offer of seasonal flu vaccine, and in the course of the interviews respondents were also asked to express their views about the nature and causes of the two key illnesses. The latter are among the most common infections in human beings. In terms of the biomedical paradigm the common cold is caused by numerous respiratory viruses, whilst flu is caused by the influenza virus. Medical diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds without laboratory confirmation. Symptoms of flu include sudden onset of fever and cough, and colds are characterized by sneezing, sore throat, and runny nose, but in practice the symptoms often overlap. In this study we examine the degree by which the views of lay people with respect to both diagnosis and epidemiology diverge with that which is evident in biomedical discourse. Our results indicate that whilst most of the identified symptoms are common to lay and professional people, the former integrate symptoms into a markedly different observational frame from the latter. And as far as causation is concerned it is clear that lay people emphasize the role of 'resistance' and 'immunity' at least as much as 'infection' in accounting for the onset of colds and flu. The data are analyzed using novel methods that focus on the co-occurrence of concepts and are displayed as semantic networks. As well as reporting on its findings the authors draw out some implications of the study for social scientific and policy discussions concerning lay diagnosis, lay expertise and the concept of an expert patient.",

            "text": "The lay diagnosis of colds and flu Colds and flu, collectively referred to in biomedical terms as upper respiratory tract infections or URTIs, are the most common infections in human beings. Adults may have between two and five episodes of the cold in a year, and schoolchildren from five to seven episodes (Eccles, 2005) . During the twentieth century biomedical understanding of URTIs was primarily focused on the identification of the viral agents that are regarded by medical professionals as their main cause. Influenza virus was first identified during the 1930s, and during the 1950s and 60s numerous viruses including rhinovirus, coronavirus and adenovirus were associated with the common cold (Heikkinen & J\u00e4rvinen, 2003) . By the beginning of the current century over 200 serologically different virus types had been implicated in the aetiology of the cold (McChlery, Ramage, & Bagg, 2009, p. 151) . In parallel with the identification of viral agents, the public health effort from the latter part of the twentieth century was concentrated on delivering effective vaccines to reduce the prevalence of seasonal and pandemic flu variants e the most recent global attempt relating to the winter of 2009e2010. However, despite the fact that URTI's have been progressively taken into the laboratory and systematically 'Jennerized' (c.f. Latour, 1988) , the main site for their diagnosis is in the community or the world of everyday life. And in that world the understanding of respiratory infections is mediated through a web of concerns e about the origins and interconnection of symptoms, the maintenance of personal health and the distribution of illness among relatives, friends, and neighbours. This paper focuses on such concerns and in particular how colds and flu are spoken about and diagnosed by lay people in ordinary, everyday, non-clinical settings. The data are drawn from a qualitative interview based study (N \u00bc 54) of older people's understanding and acceptance of seasonal flu vaccine that was undertaken in South Wales during the earlier part of the current decade.",

            "text": "From the work of Stimson and Webb (1975) onward there has been an increasing recognition of the role played by lay people (as patients) in the diagnostic process (see, for example, Beach, 2001; Frankel, 2001; Gill & Maynard, 2006; Gill, Pomerantz, & Denvir, 2010; Heath, 1992; Per\u00e4kyl\u00e4, 2006) . However, the overwhelming majority of relevant studies look at doctorepatient activity in clinical settings e mostly using techniques of conversation analysis. Interestingly, some of those who research into lay engagement with the diagnostic process argue that the word diagnosis should be reserved solely for categorizations of disease by doctors (e.g., Gill et al., 2010, p. 17) . The research reported on here is somewhat different from the work just referred to in that it examines how lay people identify and categorize groups of symptoms in the 'lifeworld' (Mishler, 1984, p. 104) , or the world 'grounded' in everyday life, rather than the world of the clinic or the consulting room. In the context of common respiratory symptoms, it is also worth noting that there has been a long tradition of looking at the ways in which lay people understand the symptomatology of URTI's, and especially 'colds' (see, for example, ; Baer, Weller, Garcia, 2008; Baer, Weller, Pachter et al, 1999; Helman, 1978; McCombie, 1987) . However, most of that work examines the range of symptoms lay people associate with cold e and to a lesser extent flu -and how they explain respiratory illness. Such studies are not overly concerned with how lay people differentiate between or how they diagnose colds and flu e a topic that is the focus of this paper.",

It is also a topic directly relevant to discussions concerning the display of expertise by lay people in matters of health and illness more generally (Fox, Ward, & O'Rourke, 2005; Prior, 2003) . While in policy terms, the topic connects to a growing 'acknowledgment'e especially with regard to chronic conditions e of patient expertise in health care and the ways in which such expertise can be drawn upon in the delivery of services to the public at large (Donaldson, 2003; Lindsay & Vrijhoef, 2009; Rogers, Bury, & Kennedy, 2009; Wilson, 1999) .

Respondents were selected from a previous agestratified random postal survey of people in the area aged over 65 who had reported on their immunization status. In light of those reports we chose to sample across a range of status groups. Eighteen people who had refused immunization, 15 who had previously accepted immunization but had since 'relapsed', 5 people who claimed that they had never been offered immunization and 16 people who had accepted the vaccine (including 5 'first timers') were eventually included in the study.

Qualitative interviews of this kind have previously been categorized as a genre of conversation (Kvale, 1996, p. 5) in which respondents tend to reply to questions in a free-flowing style. In our case, for example, that style led the research participants to talk about the causes of upper respiratory tract infections in general and not merely the causes of flu.

There are various advantages of using such automated text-mining techniques for data analysis. One offshoot is that the data set can be trawled for instances of co-occurrence between two concepts (such as flu jab and side-effects). The programme in use is capable of calculating a coefficient for all such co-occurring concepts and can display the results of such connections diagrammatically. Following the exclusion of terms with fewer than 5 citations, the programme identified some 119 concepts (flu, flu jab, side-effects, colds, etc) in our data set. The coefficients of cooccurrence between these concepts naturally varied in strength. In some cases the strength of the links was unsurprising (e.g. the cooccurrence coefficient for the link between cold and flu was unity since the two terms occurred in all interviews); in other cases the link was considerably weaker (e.g. the link between 'virus' and flu was only 0.15).",

For example, the number of instances a concept appears is given, as well as a visual representation as to how that term links to related concepts.

These data form the basis for the information displayed in Figs. 1 and 2. Unfortunately, text-mining software uses the document (interview) as the basis for all its calculations and so it is not immediately clear whether the interviewer or the interviewee makes the connections between concepts. In our case we have restricted ourselves to looking at explicit links made only by the respondents, and for that reason we have extracted the textmining results and re-incorporated them into semantic networks using social network software (De Nooy, Mrvar, & Batagelj, 2005) rather than the original text-mining software. Our focus is of course more on the concept networks than on social networks, and the figures provide a graphic indication of the nature and strength of the co-occurrence relationships between the basic terms and concepts in the 54 interviews.",

It is not surprising perhaps that in biomedical literature cold and flu are regarded as syndromes rather than as clear cut ontological categories, and the preferred contemporary biomedical designation is 'URTI' or upper respiratory tract infection. As is also implied above, colds and flu are diagnosed clinically, though laboratory findings are regarded as necessary for the confirmation of any diagnosis.

In that respect the procedure differs little from that of clinicians. For diagnostic purposes, of course, clinicians have ultimate recourse to a laboratory identification of a causative agent e though that is rarely used in routine consultations. Lay people have no recourse to such data and one might guess that even if they did they would interpret findings in a distinctly colloquial manner. Indeed, from our data set it is clear that lay people understand symptoms in a markedly different frame from that of medical professionals. In particular they report not only on symptoms relating to the body (especially the head), but also on behavioural correlates e and to a lesser extent on some psychological factors. In addition, lay people mention symptoms that are not ordinarily associated with flu in the medical literature, and they also connect the body itself to colds and flu in ways that can run counter to a prevailing western medical cosmology that seeks to connect pathology to specific anatomical sites. Fig. 1 shows in diagrammatic form the key symptoms that lay people associate with colds and flu respectively. The thickness of the lines between the concept nodes express the value of a coefficient of co-occurrence between a reference to any given symptom (in 54 interviews), and any other symptom mentioned. The diagram also displays links between the symptoms and the two key entities of 'cold' and 'flu'. The calculation of the coefficient is based on that used in text-mining software (SPSS: 2007, p. 183) , except that here the links are confined to those that are explicitly made by the respondent between the various concepts in the course of the interview (rather than the words merely appearing anywhere in the document). The size of a node is proportional to the total number of references to each concept in the 54 transcripts.",

Unsurprisingly, and as is also evident in Fig. 1 , the nose (and sneezing) is particularly prominent in the symptom pattern for cold, though associated sites such as the sinus, the throat and the eyes also figure in the diagnostic frame. This is in marked contrast to flu which is invariably viewed as a whole body illness e characterized by whole 'bodyache' (Fig.1) . Interestingly, a number of respondents also referred (usually in a dismissive manner) to a third category of illness 'the sniffles' e which seemed to relate to very mild forms of rhinorrhea and associated nasal symptoms.

Flu in that sense is more 'serious'. We return to examine some of the implications of the analysis in the discussion section of the paper. For now we turn to an exploration of causation. Fig. 2 is based on the talk that our respondents made in response to the question, \"how do you think people catch flu?\" As we have already stated, semi-structured interviews of the kind used for this study are often characterized as akin to 'a conversation with a purpose' (Kahn & Cannell, 1957, p. 97 ); as such they are designed to generate data rather than just to collect data. In our case and even though our focus was on the causes of flu, our respondents spoke extensively about the causes of both cold and flu and even of pneumonia (see extracts below). Their responses led to the identification of a wide range of factors associated with the onset of the two key conditions; we can see virtually all of these referenced in Fig. 2 . Therein are mentioned items such as 'bugs' (and 'germs') as well as viruses; but the most commonly referred to causes invoked 'the air' and 'atmosphere'. The interview data also pointed toward means of transmission as 'cause' e so coughs and sneezes and mixing in crowds figure in the causal mix. Most interesting perhaps is that lay people make a nascent distinction between facilitating factors (such as bugs and viruses) and inhibiting factors (such as being resistant, immune, or healthy), so that in the presence of the latter, the former are seen to have very little effect.",

Thus; (R:3) \"I suppose it's [the cause of flu] in the air. I think I get more diseases going to the surgery than if I stayed home. Sometimes the waiting room is packed and you've got little kids coughing and spluttering and people sneezing, and air conditioning I think is a killer by and large I think air conditioning in lots of these offices. I know in the last years of when I was working, we had air conditioning in offices and I had more coughs and colds more during that period than I ever had\". (R:46) \"I think you catch flu from other people. You know in enclosed environments in air conditioning which in my opinion is the biggest cause of transferring diseases is air conditioning. Worse thing that was ever invented that was. I think so, you know. It happens on aircraft exactly the same you know.\" While, the following respondent connects the air to flu's 'own little germs': (R:17) \"I think it's [the flu] in the air with people who've got it. I don't really know. I know the old saying goes, coughs and sneezes spread diseases, but whether it's the flu or not or whether that's just colds or coughs. I don't think you catch it off someone else, I think you do it all by yourself. Quite clever. I don't really know. I think it probably does come with the environment if you're working in an office and everybody's snuffly and .I think possibly flu can be more dangerous than people think. It's not just a cold plus. It has it's own little germs\".",

For example being 'hardened' (R:14) to germs and harsh weather can prevent a person getting colds and flu. Being 'healthy' (R:27) can itself negate the effects of any causative agents, and healthiness is often linked to aspects of 'good' nutrition and diet (R:35, R:16), and not smoking cigarettes. These mitigating and inhibiting factors can either mollify the effects of infection or prevent a person 'catching' the flu entirely. Thus, (R:45) argued that it was almost impossible for him to catch flu or cold \"Cos I got all this resistance\".Interestingly respondents often used possessive pronouns in their discussion of immunity and resistance ('my immunity', and 'my resistance') e and tended to view them as personal assets (or capital) that might be compromised by mixing with crowds (see R:5 below).",

However, there are important differences to note. For example, members of the sample reported on here associated 'fever' with cold as well as with flu, and a number of people associated vomiting with flu (though not with cold). Other populations e such as Latin American populations -do not seemingly associate gastric symptoms with respiratory disease. More importantly, perhaps, it seems that the ways in which members of our sample integrated the symptom pattern into an understanding of cold and flu is quite different from that which appears in professional medical discourse. In particular, lay people place a heavy emphasis on behavioural correlates as distinguishing features of flu e being bedridden and therefore unable to function normally is exclusively associated with flu and constitutes a defining feature of flu. There is no consistent reference to causative agents here as a means of demarcating cold from flu. Furthermore it is clear that flu is interpreted as a whole body illness characterized by an aching body (rather than just aching muscles) while colds are mainly confined to the head e head cold. It is not merely that in cases of flu people suffer with aching muscles (and of course they do), but that they, as homo totus, are ill. In medical anthropology the concept of a whole body illness is far from unknown. However, such illnesses are usually spoken of in the context of culture-bound syndromes and disorders with psychiatric symptoms. They are also reported on almost exclusively in studies of people living in countries outside of the advanced industrial world -see, for example, Oths (1999) study of 'debilidad'. Yet from the talk of informants in our study it seems plausible to suggest that, among this group of older white English speaking people at least, 'the flu' is essentially regarded as a whole body illness in which psychological symptoms (feeling low or down) play a very minor role (None of the respondents associated feeling low or feeling down with colds).",
