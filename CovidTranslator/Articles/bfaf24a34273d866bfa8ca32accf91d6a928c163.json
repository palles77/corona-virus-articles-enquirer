            "text": "Golgi mannosyltransferase. A series of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged fusion proteins was constructed in which invertase is appended to the Golgi-luminal carboxy terminus of full-length Oehlp. Several constructs included a Kex2p cleavage site between the Ochlp and invertase moieties to monitor transit to the Kex2p-containing TGN. Cells expressing an Ochlp-invertase fusion do not secrete invertase, but those expressing an Ochlp-Kex2p site-invertase fusion protein secrete high levels of invertase in a Kex2pdependent manner. The Ochlp-Kex2p site-invertase fusion protein is cleaved with a half-time of 5 min, and the process proceeds to completion. Before cleavage the protein receives glycosyl modifications indicative of passage through the medialand trans-Golgi, therefore cleavage occurs after ordered anterograde transport through the Golgi to the TGN. Transit to distal compartments is not induced by the invertase moiety, since noninvertase fusion constructs encounter the same glycosyltransferases and Kex2p as well. The Ochlp-HA moiety, irrespective of whether it is generated by cleavage of the fusion protein in the TGN or synthesized de novo, is degraded with a half-time of about 60 min. Thus, the half-time of degradation is 12-fold longer than the time required to reach the TGN. At steady state, de novo--synthesized and TGN-generated HA epitope-tagged Ochlp reside in a compartment with a buoyant density identical to that of wild-type Ochlp and distinct from that of the vacuole or the TGN. Finally, ochl null cells that express an Ochlp fusion construct known to rapidly encounter the TGN glycosylate invertase to the same extent as wild-type cells, indicating that they have phenotypically wild-type Ochlp activity. These results lead us to propose a model for Ochlp-HA localization that involves movement to distal compartments, at least as far as the TGN, followed by retrieval to the cis compartment, presumably by vesicular transport.",

            "text": "T HE eukaryotic secretory pathway consists of a set of membrane-bound compartments that are involved in delivery of newly made proteins to their final destinations. The hub of this pathway is the Golgi apparatus, which is involved in the posttranslational modification and sorting of the proteins that pass through it. The Golgi is composed of several topologically distinct cisternae, each of which contains a unique set of resident proteins. These proteins must resist dispersion by the large flux of vesicular traffic to and from the Golgi apparatus. This process is as important as the initial delivery of proteins to this organelle, yet it is not well understood. For example, it is not known whether newly made Golgi proteins simply cease their forward movement upon reaching the correct cisternae, or whether they are localized by a more dynamic mechanism involving recycling through later compartments.",

            "text": "Compared to the mechanism of ER protein retention, much less is known about the mechanism of protein retention in the Golgi apparatus. Although the scattered Golgi apparatus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is morphologically distinct from its stacked mammalian counterpart, it is quite similar biochemically, and therefore provides an excellent model system for analysis of Golgi protein retention. Several lines of evidence indicate that the yeast Golgi, like that of mammalian cells, is composed of distinct compartments. For example, the sequential maturation of oligosaccharides in the yeast Golgi requires the SEC18 gene product (yeast N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, NSF) at multiple stages, indicating that the modification enzymes are sequestered in functionally and topologically distinct compartments (31) . Localization of Golgi resident proteins by indirect immunofluorescence (26) and subcellular fractionation (9, 11, 18, 28, 105) also reveals that different Golgi enzymes reside in separable compartments. Similarly, transport of pro-a-factor from the ER to the Golgi in vitro results in only the earliest glycosyl modification, indicating that the glycosyl transferases used at later steps are not contained within the acceptor compartment (4, 34) . In sum, these and other studies indicate that the yeast Golgi can be subdivided into at least four compartments. The ER-proximal, or cis, compartment contains the initiating ~t-l,6-mannosyltransferase (ManT), Ochlp (28, 65) , which is responsible for addition of the first mannose residue to the core oligosaccharides obtained in the ER (64, 80) . The next, or medial, compartment contains the elongating o~-l,6-ManT activity (28) . The terminal et-l,3-ManT, encoded by MNN1 (77) , is contained within the equivalent of the trans-Golgi and TGN (31, 33) . The TGN, which is the most distal Golgi compartment, also contains the Kex2p, Kexlp, and DPAP A proteases (11, 18, 25, 31) .",

(A recently described exception is Emp47, which is a Type I IMP of the yeast medial-Golgi [88] ). In contrast, TGN residents are generally type I IMPs with the opposite topology. Much effort has been directed towards identifying the \"Golgi retention signal\" of early type II proteins. Many studies indicate that the transmembrane domain is critical (2, 14, 32, 39, 57, 89, 98, 99, 111) with some researchers finding that the adjacent regions are also involved (15, 19, 58, 59, 62, 66, 83, 100, 104) . However, several groups have argued that retention is conferred by multiple domains of the molecule (3, 7, 12, 32, 54, 90) . For example, in yeast, the transmembrane domain of Mnnlp can localize a heterologous protein to the Golgi; nevertheless, a soluble form of Mnnlp, completely lacking a transmembrane domain, is also localized to the Golgi (32) . Thus, there may be multiple signals involving cytoplasmic, membrane-spanning, and luminal domains that act together to affect the proper localization of Golgi proteins.",

Elimination of the cytoplasmic tails of the TGN proteases DPAP A, Kex2p, or Kexlp destroys retention and results in transport to the vacuole (16, 69, 106) . In addition, loss of clathrin function in yeast results in mislocalization of Kex2p and DPAP A to the plasma membrane (91) . It was suggested, therefore, that clathrin binding to the cytoplasmic tails of Kex2p or DPAP A was necessary for either direct retention or recycling of late Golgi enzymes (91) .",

            "text": "Localization of the type I proteins to the TGN and type II proteins to the earlier compartments appears to occur via different mechanisms. First, clathrin may not be directly required for localization of early Golgi proteins because GDPase, a type II early Golgi protein, is not mislocalized in a ctathrin mutant (92) . In contrast, Mnnlp, a type II enzyme that seems to have dual citizenship in both the trans-Golgi and TGN of yeast, is mislocalized in a clathrin mutant (33) . However, this effect is not mediated through the cytoplasmic tail of Mnnlp (33) , and it may be due to a more indirect effect on TGN structure or function in clathrin mutants. Second, the early and late Golgi retention mechanisms differ in their saturability. For example, overexpression of the type I proteins Kex2p or DPAP A causes a significant fraction of the protein to mislocalize to the vacuole (69, 106) , whereas the Golgi seems to be able to readily localize overexpressed Mnnlp, which is a type II protein (32) . Behavior of Mnnlp is more similar to mammalian glycosyltransferases, which upon overexpression are predominately correctly localized, although ER accumulation is sometimes observed (62, 66, 97) . Finally, early type II and late type I retention systems appear to be distinct because overexpression of Mnnlp does not alter the turnover of Kex2p, suggesting that the proteins are not competing for a common component (33) .",

Probably the most widely held view, first proposed by Swift and Machamer (97) , is that Golgi proteins form aggregates that are too large to enter forward-moving transport vesicles and are thus retained (53, 68, 90, 97, 104) . This model requires that aggregation be induced at a particular point during Golgi transit, perhaps by some physiochemical property of particular Golgi subcompartments. A related model, called the \"kin recognition model\" (67, 68) , posits that different resident proteins of a particular cisternae interact to form large heterooligomers that restrict forward movement, possibly by anchoring to a Golgi matrix (96) . Yet a third model is based on two observations: first, that Golgi protein transmembrane domains are shorter, in general, than those of plasma membrane proteins (10) , and second, that a cholesterol concentration gradient seems to exist in the mammalian secretory pathway (72) , with the ER being relatively depleted and the plasma membrane being relatively enriched. Cholesterol tends to thicken lipid bilayers, hence the proposal that proteins transit the secretory pathway until their transmembrane domains \"fit\" the thickness (35) of the surrounding bilayer. Premature retention or continued movement forward would be energetically unfavorable due to the hydrophobic effect. One of the features common to all these models is that once a protein reaches its correct subcompartment within the Golgi, it is postulated to cease its forward movement and be retained.",

Instead, they move to later Golgi compartments, at least as far as the TGN, after which they return to the cis compartment. Our results indicate that yeast possesses a retrograde transport pathway from the TGN to the cis compartment, and furthermore, that localization of HA epitope-tagged Ochlp to the cis-Golgi at steady state is due, at least in part, to recycling from later Golgi cisternae.",

Emr (University of California, San Diego), was subcloned into the yeast CEN-containing shuttle vector pRS416 (95) that had also been digested with BamHI and HindIII. Plasmid pKEX2-HA (TRP1, CEN) was made by snbcloning the KEX2-HA-bearing SalI/Eagl fragment from pSN218 (70), kindly provided by T. Stevens (University of Oregon, Eugene), into the yeast CEN-containing shuttle vector pRS414 (95) that had been digested with SalI and EagI. The KEX2 gene on pKEX2-HA contains the sequence encoding three repeated copies of the 9-amino acid epitope (YPYDVPDYA) from HA protein (110) . Plasmid pSH113 was created by digesting pBL-OCH1, generously provided by Y. Jigami (National Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology, Tsukuba, Japan) (65), with XcmI followed by incubation with T4 DNA polymerase to yield blunt ends. The linearized plasmid was then digested with NsiI and ligated to a SmaI-PstI LEU2 fragment from pMR2253, kindly provided by M. Plasmid pO, which encodes Ochlp, was created by inserting the 2.6-kb XhoI-HindIII OCH1 fragment from pBL-OCH1 into pRS416. Plasmid pO-HindIII was made by introducing a HindIII site at the codon for amino acid 472 (of the 480 amino acid Ochlp) by unique site elimination site-directed mutagenesis (20) . Plasmid pOI, which encodes the first 472 amino acids of Ochlp fused in frame to amino acid 2 of mature invertase, was created by ligating the SUC2-containing HindlII-PvuII fragment from plasmid pSEY306 (44) to pO-HindIII that had been digested with HindIII and SaclI. The amino acid sequence in single letter code at the Ochlp-invertase fusion ioint encoded by pOI is KEAST (where K is amino acid 470 of Ochlp and T is amino acid 2 of mature invertase). Plasmid pOKI encodes, at the junction between Ochlp and invertase, six amino acids from pro-a-factor (MYKREA) that contain the dibasic recognition site for the Kex2 protease. Plasmid pOKI was created by site-directed mutagenesis of the pOI plasmid using a mutagenic oligonucleotide that spanned OCH1 and SUC2. In one round of mutagenesis, the HindIII site at the junction of OCH1 and SUC2 was removed, amino acids 472-478 of Ochlp were restored, the Kex2 (MYKREA) cleavage site was added, and a NheI site was created. The sequence present at the fusion junction encoded by pOKI is: G (amino acid 478 of Ochlp) AS (encoded by the NheI site) MYKREA (Kex2p cleavage site) M (amino acid 1 of mature invertase).",

In the light of recent data suggesting a recycling component to the localization mechanisms of ER (28, 74, 101) and TGN resident proteins (108), as well as a type I IMP in the medial-Golgi of yeast (88), we thought it was possible that localization of type II IMPs within the Golgi stacks might also involve retrieval of proteins that have escaped to more distal compartments. To examine this question, we chose to use Ochlp because its activity represents the first post-ER enzymatic event required for synthesis of outer-chain mannose linkages on yeast secretory proteins, and thus Ochlp must reside in a very early Golgi compartment (64, 80) . This cis-Golgi localization has recently been confirmed by Gaynor et al. (28) . To monitor the trafficking of Ochlp, it was fused to the reporter enzyme invertase, which is encoded by the SUC2 gene (Fig. 1) . Secretion of invertase into the yeast periplasm is necessary for cells to use sucrose as a carbon source (13) . A recognition site for the Kex2 protease was included at the junction of Ochlp and invertase to monitor passage of the fusion protein into the Kex2p compartment, or TGN. The amino acid sequence encoding the Kex2 cleavage site (MYKREA) was derived from the MFal gene (49) . MF~I encodes a precursor protein that transits the secretory pathway and is proteolytically processed by several enzymes in the TGN to yield mature a-factor pheromone, which is secreted from the cell (27, 78) . The Kex2p endopeptidase cleaves on the carboxyl side of the KR sequence found in the a-factor peptide (1, 45) .",

This anchoring would result in a Suc-phenotype in suc2A9 cells because the fu- sion would not travel to the TGN. Thus, the invertase moiety could not be released by Kex2p, and subsequent movement to the cell surface would be prohibited. If, however, the fusion protein was capable of movement to the TGN, then Kex2p would release the invertase moiety, allowing the enzyme to travel to the cell surface resulting in a Suc \u00f7 phenotype. Therefore, the ability of various Ochlp-Kex2 site-invertase fusion proteins to confer a Suc \u00f7 phenotype to suc2A9 cells would be the first test of whether Ochlp is capable of movement to more distal Golgi compartments.

To examine this finding further, we determined the amount of cleaved OHKI present in cells at steady state by immunoblot analysis using the anti-HA epitope antibody to detect OH and OHKI. Indeed, uncleaved OHKI, which migrates at ,~150 kD (see Fig. 3 ), is virtually undetectable in logarithmically growing cells (Fig. 2) . Instead, the only HA-immunoreactive protein in the strain expressing OHKI appears as a single band at ~66 kD that comigrates on SDS-PAGE with HA epitopetagged Oehlp.

            "text": "Although OHKI is not subject to the high degree of outerchain glycosylation as seen with wild-type invertase (102), a portion of the fusion protein migrates as a heterogeneous population of higher molecular mass polypeptides before cleavage by Kex2p (see the 5-min time point in Fig. 3 ). To examine whether this higher molecular mass \"smear\" represents fusion protein that had received outerchain glycosylation, we used mannose linkage-specific antibodies (Fig. 4) . Cells expressing OHKI were briefly pulse labeled as in Fig. 3 and then chased for 5 min before IP with anti-HA epitope antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the anti-HA epitope antibody and subjected to a second IP with antibody specific for either the HA epitope, the oL-1,6-mannose linkage, which is added in the cis/medial Golgi, or the o~-l,3-mannose linkage, which is added in the trans/TGN compartments. The 150-kD OHKI fusion protein (Fig. 4 ) was immunoprecipitated by the a-l,6-mannose-specific antisera, indicating that it had obtained at least the \"initial\" o~-l,6-mannose residue in the cis-Golgi. A portion of the heterogeneous smear that migrates just slightly slower than the 150-kD protein could be immunoprecipitated by the a-l,6-mannose-specific antisera, but not the a-l,3-mannose-specific antisera (Fig. 4 , compare lanes 2 and 3). We believe this represents material that had progressed to the medial-Golgi, where the a-l,6 mannose outer-chain backbone was elongated, but had not moved to the trans-Golgi, and min. SEY6210 cells expressing OHKI were labeled with Tran35Slabel for 2 rain at 30\u00b0C and chased for the times indicated. HA epitope-tagged proteins from each time point were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA epitope antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. The OHKI and OH (generated from OHKI) proteins are indicated on the left. therefore had not obtained terminal ot-l,3-mannose linkages. The higher molecular mass region of the smear was immunoprecipitable by both the a-l,6-and a-l,3-mannose-specific antibodies, indicating that this material had been exposed to the a-l,3 ManT in the trans-Golgi. Finally, as indicated previously, OH is derived from OHKI by Kex2p cleavage in the TGN. This experiment indicated that within 5 min of synthesis, OHKI receives all the modifications indicative of transit through the cis, medial, trans, and TGN compartments. Some OH derived from OHKI is also immunoprecipitable by the a-l,6-and the ot-l,3-mannose-specific antibodies, but to a lesser extent than the invertase-containing fusion protein. This may reflect the fact that Ochlp has only four potential glycosylation sites (65) compared to the 13 sites of invertase (13) . Another possibility is that the oligosaccharides on the Ochlp moiety are less heavily modified than those on the invertase moiety and therefore less immunoreactive (6) . The experiments presented above indicate that OHKI rapidly receives outer-chain glycosyl modifications and is cleaved by Kex2p, but do not clearly show where this cleavage is occurring. Three possibilities have been considered: (a) OHKI is cleaved by Kex2p in the ER or in transport vesicles bound for the Golgi, (b) OHKI is statically retained in the cis-Golgi and is cleaved in situ by newly synthesized Kex2p or Kex2p that may be recycling from the TGN (if this, in fact, occurs), and (c) OHKI travels to the TGN where it encounters Kex2p and is cleaved.",

Therefore, the kinetics of vesicular transport in sec18-1 cells is slightly slower than in wild-type cells, even at the \"permissive\" temperature of 25\u00b0C. This probably reflects a reduction in the activity of Secl8p. Despite this kinetic effect, it is clear that in sec18-1 cells (Fig. 5, bottom panel) , conversion of OHKI to OH ceases after blocking vesicular transport at the restrictive temperature. This result is inconsistent with the first two possibilities described above. OHKI is not processed in the ER, in ER-derived transport vesicles, or in the cis-Golgi either by newly synthesized Kex2p or by Kex2p recycling back from the TGN. If this were occurring, the Kex2p present in the OHKI-bearing compartments would be trapped there after the temperature shift and continue to be active. The result would be generation of OH from OHKI, which is not observed.",

In support of this conclusion is the finding that neither the c~-1,6-nor ot-l,3-mannose-modified OHKI is converted to OH after imposition of the transport block (Fig. 5, bottom panel) in sec18-1 Figure 5 . Cleavage of OHKI occurs in the TGN. Isogenic SEC18 and secl8-1 strains (SH104 with or without pSEC18) expressing OHKI were labeled with Tran35S-label for 7.5 min at 25\u00b0C.

This result indicates that processing by Kex2p only occurs after modification in the medialand trans-Golgi. Furthermore, the processing must occur in a separate compartment, distinct from the medialand trans-Golgi. Taken together, this analysis indicated that conversion of OHKI to OH does not take place in the ER, or the cis-, medial-, or trans-Golgi. We conclude that the processing of OHKI to OH occurs in the Kex2p compartment, the TGN.",

This construct, termed O K H (Fig. 1) , consists of Ochlp followed by the Kex2 cleavage site and the H A epitope tag, but lacks the invertase moiety. Cleavage of the O K H protein by Kex2p will result in the removal of the H A epitope causing the protein to be refractory to IP by the anti-HA epitope antibody. O K H was expressed in isogenic suc2A9 and suc2zl9 Akex2 strains, and pulse-chase experiments were performed to follow the transit of the O K H protein (Fig. 6) . In the absence of Kex2p activity, the O K H is immunoprecipitable with the anti-HA epitope antibody for an extended period of time. However, in the presence of functional Kex2p, the O K H protein is rapidly cleaved by the protease with a half-time (~5 min) very similar to that seen for the O H K I fusion protein (Fig. 3) .

Invertase provides a sensitive measure of the outer-chain glycosylation because it is hyper-glycosylated as it passes through the Golgi (24). Since Ochlp is responsible for initiation of this extensive glycosylation (64, 80) , a significant decrease in Ochlp activity should be evident as reduced glycosylation of invertase. Therefore, various strains (wildtype, Aochl , and Aochl expressing wild-type Ochlp [O], OH, or OKH) were labeled, and the glycosylation state of endogenous invertase was examined by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 11 ). As expected, invertase is hyper-glycosylated in the wild-type strain, migrating as a heterogeneous smear. In contrast, invertase in the Aochl strain migrates as a distinct band because outer-chain glycosylation cannot be initiated. Expression of either wild-type Ochlp (O) or H A epitope-tagged Ochlp (OH) in the Aochl strain results in wild-type glycosylation of invertase. Significantly, expression of OKH, which encounters the Kex2p compartment with a half-time of 5 min (Fig. 6) , also results in hyper-glycosylation of invertase, suggesting that an Ochlp moiety known to transit to the late Golgi is fully active. Taken together, these data suggest a model in which the steady-state distribution of epitope-tagged Ochlp is in the cis-Golgi, yet the protein undergoes rapid movement through later compartments and is retrieved.",

The most instructive protein consisted of fulllength Ochlp, an HA epitope tag, a Kex2p cleavage site, and full-length invertase (OHKI). Surprisingly, we have found that OHKI is not efficiently retained in the cis-Golgi. This protein moves to the TGN, where it is processed by Kex2p, resulting in invertase secretion. Remarkably, this cleavage event occurs with a half-time of ~5 min, and is so efficient that the uncleaved fusion protein is undetectable at steady state. The oligosaccharides of the fusion protein receive medial (elongated ct-l,6-mannose) and trans (terminal o~-l,3-mannose) modifications before Kex2p cleavage. This indicates that the cleavage of OHKI occurs after the fusion protein has encountered the c/s-, medial-, and trans-Golgi. Newly synthesized Kex2p in transit through the cis compartment, or Kex2p recycling through the early Golgi, are not responsible for cleavage of OHKI. Thus, processing of OHKI occurs in the TGN.",

We have also shown that the bulk of both ER-synthesized OH and TGN-generated OH resides in a compartment with the same density as wild-type Ochlp and a lower buoyant density than the TGN. This indicates that OH derived from OHKI in the TGN is correctly localized to the cis-Golgi at steady state despite its rapid transit through the TGN.

In fact, it is difficult to imagine a model that allows for distinct protein compositions in different cisternae that does not involve at least a transiently retained state. One can view the process of retention as a pause in a particular compartment. At one extreme, the protein \"pauses\" for its entire lifetime (that is, it has a high affinity for the retained state), after which it is released and degraded. In the other extreme, the pause is short compared to the lifetime of the protein (a low affinity for the retained state), and after continued movement the protein can be retrieved from distal compartments. This recycling continues until the protein finally escapes the retrieval system and is degraded. The degree to which differ-ent proteins pause may vary. In this kinetic retention model epitope-tagged Ochlp would pause only briefly, possibly because of a low affinity for the putative retained state, but this effect would be sufficient to result in the predominantly c/s-Golgi distribution of OH at steady state.",

            "text": "These findings are in accordance with a recent study of the localization of Mnnlp (32) , which is the terminal tx-l,3-ManT in yeast. Mnnlp is distinctive because of its approximately equal distribution between two physically separable compartments, one of which contains Kex2p (33) ; that is, Mnnlp resides in both the trans-Golgi and TGN compartments. Recently, Graham and Krasnov (32) used a fusion protein consisting of the Mnnlp transmembrane domain followed by a Kex2p site and invertase to examine the extent of exposure of this protein to the Kex2p enzyme. They found that 85% of the protein was rapidly processed by Kex2p, which is more than could be accounted for by the dual steady-state distribution of Mnnlp in the trans-Golgi and TGN. Therefore, they suggested that Mnnlp may cycle between the trans-Golgi and TGN. In \u2022 the same study, however, it was also shown that the luminal domain of Mnnlp, which was not included in the fusion protein, also contains localization information. Accordingly, the authors pointed out that the disproportionately high exposure of the fusion protein to the TGN might be due to the absence of the Mnnlp luminal domain. Our results with full-length Ochlp constructs tend to support Graham and Krasnov's suggestion that Mnnlp cycles between the trans and TGN compartments.",

            "text": "Another outcome of our analyses with Ochlp is the clear demonstration of a retrograde transport pathway from the TGN to the cis-Golgi. This extends the recent demonstration by Schrrder et al. (88) that a type I medial-Golgi protein, Emp47, has a recycling itinerary that extends from the trans-Golgi (i.e., the et-l,3-ManT compartment) to the ER. There are also several precedents for retrograde transport through the Golgi apparatus in mammalian cells. First, several residents of the secretory pathway have been shown to obtain oligosaccharide modifications that occur in later compartments. For example, the oligosaccharides of the ER resident calreticulin are terminally galactosylated, a modification that occurs in the trans-Golgi (76) . Likewise, two medial-Golgi resident proteins, GIMPc (112) and MG160 (30) , have been shown to bear terminal sialic acid residues, which are added in the TGN. In addition, the N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase I enzyme, a resident of the medial/trans-Golgi, can undergo retrograde transport to the early Golgi (40) . Second, several toxins which are taken up by endocytosis, such as Pseudomonas exotoxin, ultimately gain access to the cytosol via the ER (73, 75) and their cytotoxicity can be increased by placing a KDEL sequence at their carboxy termini (93) . And finally, it was recently shown that a short peptide that contains KDEL at the carboxy terminus can move via retrograde transport from the TGN to the ER (60) .",

One could envision that the bulky invertase moiety appended to the carboxy terminus of Ochlp could somehow interfere with retention, perhaps by inhibiting entry into a putative oligomer. We have shown that is not the case because a construct without the invertase moiety encounters the TGN with the same kinetics as the invertase-bearing fusion. In addition, we have shown that Ochlp, altered only by the addition of an HA epitope tag (OH), obtained the a-l,6-and ot-l,3-mannose linkages characteristic of transit through the medial and trans compartments. This indicates that neither the specific sequences present in the Kex2 cleavage site nor invertase are responsible for continued forward movement. Finally, Ochlp--invertase fusion protein-dependent secretion of invertase is not dependent on the HA epitope tag (Tables  I and II) . Thus, movement to distal Golgi compartments is not dependent on any of the specific sequences appended to the carboxy terminus of Ochlp. However, it is possible that modification of the carboxy terminus itself, independent of the protein sequence (HA epitope, Kex2 site, or invertase), is responsible for this traffic pattern.",

First, epitopetagged Ochlp appears to be localized to the same compartment as wild-type Ochlp at steady state (Figs. 9 and 10). In addition, the fusion constructs appear to be fully active, as measured by their ability to glycosylate invertase, again suggesting that the proteins are correctly localized at steady state. However, it is important to note that the half-life of wild-type Ochlp is about 2.5-fold longer than the half-life of epitope-tagged Ochlp. There are several possible reasons for this difference. One is that the wild-type protein may enter into the putative retained state with greater efficiency than the epitope-tagged protein. The majority of the Ochlp would enjoy a lengthy retained state, and only a small percentage of the Ochlp would travel to the late Golgi where it could be either retrieved by retrograde transport or shunted to the vacuole for degradation. If this is true, then the rapid flux demonstrated by the tagged molecule OKH, for example, could indicate that a retention signal exists at the carboxy terminus of Ochlp that is disrupted by the addition of the HA epitope. Alternatively, both wild-type and epitope-tagged Ochlp may enter into the putative retained state with a similar efficiency, but retrieval from the TGN may be compromised by the presence of the epitope tag, resulting in diversion to the vacuole.",

It is likely that the wild-type protein uses the same transport system, at least to some extent.
