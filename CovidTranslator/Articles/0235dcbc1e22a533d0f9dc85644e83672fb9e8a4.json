Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers mediate the regulation of protein levels, signaling pathways, vesicular trafficking, and many other cellular processes through their covalent conjugation to proteins. Interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is a type I interferon induced ubiquitin-like modifier. In addition to conjugating to potentially hundreds of target proteins, ISG15 can be found in an unconjugated form both inside of the cell and released from interferon stimulated cells into the extracellular environment. Due to its robust expression after type I interferon stimulation and the broad panel of proteins that it targets, ISG15 has drawn much attention as a potential regulator of the immune response and has been shown to mediate protection in a number of different viral infection models. Here we will review the current state of the field of ISG15, the viruses against which ISG15 mediates protection, and the mechanisms by which ISG15 exerts antiviral activity.",

Ubiquitin is an 8.5-kD protein originally named for the nearly universal cross-immunoreactivity between the ubiquitin homologs throughout eukaryotic species. Ubiquitin covalently conjugates to target proteins forming an isopeptide bond between its Cterminal glycine and the amine groups of lysine residues in target proteins. Ubiquitination occurs through an ATP dependent enzymatic pathway consisting of an E1 activating enzyme, an E2 conjugating enzyme, and an E3 ligase 1 . One of the first functions ascribed to ubiquitin conjugation was the targeting of ubiquitinated proteins for proteasomal degradation 2 . However ubiquitin has since been shown to affect many cellular processes independent of proteasomal degradation, including the regulation of vesicular trafficking, signaling pathways, and DNA damage repair 3 .",

These ubiquitin-like modifiers share limited sequence homology to ubiquitin but contain one or more domains that adopt a beta-grasp structure similar to that of ubiquitin. The first ubiquitin-like protein to be discovered was interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15). ISG15 was discovered independently by two different laboratories. Korant et al. identified ISG15 during a study characterizing proteins induced by type I interferons (IFN) 5 . Protein lysates from Daudi cells stimulated with IFN were analyzed by 2-D gel electrophoresis at different times after stimulation. ISG15 was found to be rapidly and robustly induced after IFN stimulation. ISG15 was also identified by a group evaluating how the pool of ubiquitin conjugates is affected by viral infection 6 . This study revealed that infecting A549 cells with encephalomyocarditis virus induced a 15-kD protein which crossreacted with an antibody raised against ubiquitin. Consequently, ISG15 was originally named ubiquitin cross-reactive protein by this group. Subsequent cloning and characterization of ISG15 revealed that it contained two ubiquitin-like domains, each with approximately 30% amino acid sequence homology to ubiquitin 6; 7; 8 . The structural similarity of ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like domains of ISG15 was later confirmed when the crystal structure of ISG15 was solved 9 . Given the known regulatory potential of ubiquitin-like modifiers and the importance of type I IFN during viral infection, there has been great interest in understanding how ISG15 might regulate the immune response and virus replication.",

            "text": "ISG15 forms conjugates with a diverse pool of target proteins in a process referred to as ISGylation. ISGylation occurs through a series enzymatic reactions similar to the ubiquitin conjugation pathway (Figure 1 ). ISG15 is encoded and expressed as a 17-kD precursor protein that is immediately proteolytically processed at its C-terminus to expose a Cterminal LRLRGG amino acid sequence, identical to the C-terminal sequence of ubiquitin 10 . The cognate ISG15 E1 activating enzyme, UbE1L, initiates the ISG15 conjugation enzymatic pathway by forming a thioester bond between the C-terminal glycine of ISG15 and a cysteine residue of UbE1L 11; 12 . UbE1L is the only known E1 enzyme for ISG15, and it appears to be specific for ISG15 as it has not formed thioester bonds with other tested ubiquitin-like modifiers 11; 13 . Confirmation of the importance of UbE1L in this pathway has come from the analysis of mice deficient in UbE1L. These mice express unconjugated ISG15 but do not form ISG15 conjugates 14 . Once primed by UbE1L, ISG15 is then transferred to a cysteine residue of an E2 conjugating enzyme. siRNA knockdown of UbcH8 in human cells, and UbcM8 in mouse cells, results in nearly complete loss of ISG15 conjugate formation, suggesting that UbcH8 and UbcM8 serve as the predominant E2 enzymes in the ISG15 conjugation system 15; 16 . Additional experiments evaluating whether other proteins may serve as ISG15 E2 enzymes have found the transfer of ISG15 to UbcH5 and to UbcH7, the closest homologs of UbcH8, to be highly unfavorable 12 In an elegant study of ISG15 conjugation specificity, it was shown that almost any protein inserted into an expression vector can be ISGylated in a manner that appears to require little sequence specificity 25 . Truncation of target proteins leads to alteration in the ISGylation profile of the protein, further suggesting that the specificity of ISG15 conjugation is not strictly determined by the local amino acid sequence environment of its lysine residues. This study showed that ISGylation targets newly translated proteins, and this appears to be mediated in part by the interaction of HERC5 with polysomes. Thus the specificity of ISG15 is in part derived from the temporal expression of target proteins. How, or if, ISG15 might discriminate between proteins within the pool of actively translated proteins is unclear.",

The biological function of UBP43 and the effect of increasing ISG15 conjugation were initially evaluated both in vitro and in UBP43 deficient mice 26; 27; 28 . However, the interpretations of these studies have been complicated by the fact that UBP43 has been found to bind to the interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR) 2 and inhibit IFN signaling independent of its deconjugating activity 29; 30 . USP2, USP5, USP13, USP14 have also been shown to cleave peptide fused to the C-terminus of ISG15, however, further studies are needed to determine whether they can deconjugate ISG15 from ISGylated proteins and to understand what biological roles they may play in the regulation of ISGylation 31 .

These potential target proteins are involved in all aspects of cellular biology. The functional consequence of ISGylation is still not well understood. Proteasome inhibition has been reported to increase the pool of ISG15 conjugates but does so by means of de novo conjugate formation, not inhibition of conjugate degradation 35 . In fact, there is no evidence that ISGylation results in the proteasome mediated degradation of target proteins. One of the challenges of studying ISG15 has been that for every target protein studied, only a small fraction of the total pool of target protein is actually modified by ISG15. This phenomenon is also observed with the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO). SUMO modification is thought to be highly dynamic, but transient modification of transcription factors can lead to long lasting downstream consequences through chromatin remodeling or recruitment of inhibitory complexes 36 . Whether a similar dynamic effect might mediate the functionality of ISGylation has yet to be determined.",

Secondly, the ubiquitin conjugation system is constituted by many E2 and E3 proteins 1 . It is the binding specificity of E2 to E3 and E3 to target proteins that allows for ubiquitin to affect such a vast number of biological processes with such specificity. In contrast, it seems that formation of the overwhelming majority of ISG15 conjugates occurs through one E2 enzyme and one E3 enzyme. Finally, there is no evidence that ISG15 conjugates to itself and forms ISG15 chains in the manner of poly-ubiquitin modification.

Mice infected with a Sindbis virus expressing ISG15 but not a control virus were protected from virus induced lethality. This discovery was followed by numerous reports of ISG15 antiviral activity observed in tissue culture under conditions of ISG15 overexpression and siRNA knockdown ( Table 1) .

For several viruses contradictory results have been reported with regards to whether ISG15 antagonizes virus replication. These discrepancies are likely a result of different experimental conditions.

The increased lethality observed in the ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice could be rescued when the mice were infected with a recombinant virus expressing wild type (WT) ISG15, but not when infected with a recombinant virus expressing an ISG15(LRLRAA) mutant incapable of forming conjugates 40 . This suggested that in this viral model the antiviral activity of ISG15 was dependent upon its ability to ISGylate proteins.

In contrast, ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice experienced dramatic weight loss and viral loads reached levels up to 1000 fold higher than in WT mice at late time points. These observations were found to be true for both the mouse-adapted influenza B/Lee/40 strain, and a non-mouse-adapted influenza B/Yamagata/88 strain, indicating that ISG15 may contribute to the species tropism barrier for influenza B virus infection. UbE1L \u2212/\u2212 mice infected with influenza B virus similarly exhibited increased lethality and increased viral burden compared to WT mice, suggesting that ISG15 mediated protection from influenza B virus is also dependent on the ability of ISG15 to form conjugates 42 .

This has been seen with the retroviruses HIV-1 and ASLV, and also with Ebola virus. Despite impacting the release of all of these viruses, detailed studies have identified different mechanisms through which ISG15 is acting. The first evidence of ISG15 inhibiting virus release was observed when characterizing the effect of ISG15 on HIV-1 replication. The replication of HIV-1 in 293T cells transfected with HIV-1 proviral DNA was found to be inhibited when cotransfected with a plasmid expressing ISG15 44 . While ISG15 inhibited HIV-1 release into the supernatant, it did not affect HIV-1 protein production. Expression of ISG15 was shown to inhibit the ubiquitination the HIV-1 Gag protein and the interaction between Gag and Tsg101. Both of these events are important for mediating HIV-1 budding and release 47 . Interestingly, while cotransfection of UbE1L enhanced HIV-1 inhibition, the ectopic expression of ISG15 alone could inhibit the Gag-Tsg101 interaction, raising the possibility that the unconjugated form of ISG15 may be partly mediating this inhibition. A subsequent study has shown that HERC5 mediated ISG15 conjugation can inhibit HIV-1 budding from the plasma membrane 48 . Unlike the initial HIV-1 study, this group found that the HIV-1 Gag protein is ISGylated by HERC5. It was also shown that overexpression of ISG15 without HERC5 resulted in an accumulation of Gag in cytoplasmic clusters, whereas co-expression of ISG15 with HERC5 resulted in an accumulation of Gag at the plasma membrane. These results suggest that unconjugated ISG15 and ISGylation may act to block HIV-1 budding by two distinct mechanisms.",

Expression of the Ebola matrix protein, VP40, alone is sufficient to produce budding and release of VP40 VLPs 49 . This release is regulated by the ubiquitin E3 ligase Nedd4 through a mechanism dependent on its ligase activity 50 . Two studies demonstrated that the coexpression of ISG15 with VP40 can inhibit VP40 VLP release by inhibiting Nedd4 ligase activity, and thus inhibiting ubiquitination of VP40 51; 52 . Like the HIV-1 studies, overexpression of ISG15 alone was able to disrupt Ebola VLP release, suggesting that unconjugated ISG15 may be capable of inhibiting Nedd4 ligase activity 52 . Malakhova et al. was able to show that purified ISG15 protein was able to disrupt the ability of Nedd4 to bind to ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzymes, thus preventing ubiquitin from being transferred to the catalytic cysteine residue of Nedd4 51 . This study further showed that ISG15 could inhibit other Nedd4-like E3 ligases from augmenting VP40 VLP release. The ISG15 disruption of ubiquitin-mediated regulation during both Ebola virus and HIV-1 release raises an intriguing model for general ISG15 regulation through ubiquitin antagonism. It is possible that unconjugated ISG15 could compete with ubiquitin by binding to ubiquitin interacting domains in proteins or by forming thioester bonds with ubiquitin E2 or E3 enzymes. Additionally, ISG15 conjugation to Ubc13 on a lysine residue that is normally ubiquitinated has been reported to inhibit the E2 conjugating activity of Ubc13 53; 54 . Thus competing for target lysine residues is yet another mechanism by which ISG15 can antagonize ubiquitin.",

Despite the observed effects of ISG15 on Nedd4 in the Ebola studies, co-transfection of ISG15 with the ASLV Gag protein inhibited ASLV VLP release without disrupting the interaction between Gag and Nedd4. The disruption of Gag-Tsg101 interaction in the HIV-1 study suggested that ISG15 is disrupting an early stage in the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) pathway. Chimeric HIV-1 or ASLV Gag proteins fused to downstream ESCRT proteins can bypass early stages of the ESCRT pathway to facilitate VLP release 47 . However, in a study by Pincetic et al. it was found that ASLV Gag-ESCRT chimeras were still sensitive to ISG15 mediated inhibition 45 . ISG15 was found to prevent VLP release by inhibiting the recruitment of the AAA-ATPase Vps4 to the ESCRT pathway. This inhibition of Vps4 recruitment was dependent on charged multivesicular body protein (CHMP) 5 and correlated with ISGylation of CHMP5. However, other CHMP proteins were also found to be ISGylated in this study, and the mechanism by which ISG15 mediates this modulation of the ESCRT pathway was not conclusively shown.",

Two studies have been published showing that influenza A virus NS1 protein can be ISGylated by HERC5, and different functional consequences have been attributed to this modification 59; 60 . Both studies found that NS1 is ISGylated on more than one lysine residue. Zhao et al. found that the lysine residue at position K41 was the dominant site for ISGylation 59 . Modification at this site was shown to have no impact on the ability of NS1 to bind to double stranded RNA but did inhibit its ability to interact with importin alpha, an interaction involved in the nuclear translocation of NS1. A recombinant influenza A virus containing the K41A mutation in its NS1 protein to reduce ISGylation of NS1 was less susceptible to inhibition of replication by IFN as compared to a WT virus. Tang et al. found that seven lysines in NS1 had to be mutated to generate a non-ISGylated NS1 60 . This study found that ISGylated NS1 could not interact with the N-terminus of PKR, the RNA binding domain of NS1, U6snRNA, or dsRNA. On a functional level, ISGylation of NS1 inhibited the ability of NS1 to antagonize the induction of ISGs by SeV infection, suggesting that ISGylation of NS1 would render influenza A virus more susceptible to the antiviral response. Differences in the findings of these two studies could be due to the different strains of influenza A virus that were used in each study.

Using a HPV pseudovirus packaging system, Durfee et al. demonstrated that the expression of the ISG15 conjugation system led to the ISGylation of the HPV capsid protein, which then incorporated into released virus. ISGylation of HPV capsid protein correlated with a decrease both in the amount of virus released and in the subsequent infectivity of the virus produced in the presence of ISG15. This observation led to a model in which ISGylated capsid protein is incorporated into virions but results in an alteration of the geometry of the viral capsid. It is hypothesized that this change in the capsid structure then inhibits the infectivity of the released virus. As mentioned previously, Woods et al. also found that HIV-1 Gag protein can also be ISGylated by HERC5 48 . It is important to note that direct causality of virus replication inhibition through viral protein ISGylation, as opposed to ISGylation of host proteins, was not verified with non-ISGylatable HPV capsid or HIV-1 Gag mutants. Nonetheless, these observations help to further an attractive model for ISG15 function that could help to explain how ISGylation of a small fraction of the total pool of a protein could lead to a large downstream effect on virus fitness. Homooligomerization of viral proteins is a universal necessity in viral genomes to facilitate virion formation and genome packaging. Future studies will be needed to determine if this model can be applied to other viral proteins such as matrix proteins or ribonucleoproteins.",

This reduction of RIG-I levels was not seen in UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 MEFS further implicating the importance of ISG15 conjugation to mediate this phenomenon. The reduction of RIG-I protein levels correlated with a reduction in the intensity of the IFN response triggered by NDV 64 . In this study the residues modified by ISG15 were not identified and mutated, so it could not be ruled out that the decrease in RIG-I expression was an indirect result of the ISGylation of another protein.

A non-ISGylatable K69R, K159R PKR mutant did not exhibit constitutive activation demonstrating that this RNA independent activation of PKR was due to ISGylation of PKR.

ISG15 has also been implicated in the regulation of IFN induced apoptosis through modification of filamin B 66 . In addition to cross-linking actin filaments, filamin B also serves as a scaffold protein for the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. Jeon et al. has shown that ISGylation of filamin B disrupts its ability to bind to RAC-1, MEKK1, and MEKK4, thereby inhibiting the signaling cascade leading to JNK mediated apoptosis 66 . In this study coexpression of UbcH8 and filamin B resulted in co-localization of the two proteins in actin rich membrane ruffles. Thus while only a small fraction of total filamin B is ISGylated, the fraction of ISGylated filamin B within the local microenvironment of a membrane ruffle might be quite high. This might explain how ISGylation of a seemingly small fraction of filamin B can have a large impact on JNK signaling.",

However UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 mice did not display increase lethality, indicating that the expression of unconjugated ISG15 was sufficient to protect these mice from CHIKV induced lethality. The protective mechanism of ISG15 in this model was distinct from previous models that have been studied, in that ISG15 did not appear to function as an antiviral molecule. Viral loads in all organs examined were the same in WT, UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 and ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice. Instead the ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice had significantly higher levels of multiple cytokines in their serum, and death of the animals occurred in a manner consistent with a cytokine storm. Together these data suggested that unconjugated ISG15 protected these neonatal mice from CHIKV induced lethality through its ability to regulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The mechanism through which ISG15 regulates these responses and the cell types responsible for the increased cytokine production in this model are not known. A recombinant CHIKV engineered to express ISG15 was no less virulent than the WT virus in ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice. This suggests that unconjugated ISG15 may need to be expressed by non-infected cells, or expressed before virus infection in order to mediate protection. It is also not certain whether intracellular unconjugated ISG15 or extracellular unconjugated ISG15 is responsible for the regulation of cytokines in this model.

In studying the potential role for this released ISG15, it was found that treatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes with recombinant ISG15 resulted in specific proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells 68 . This expansion of NK cells was found to be due to the induction of IFN gamma by T-cells. Recently, a study by Bogunovic et al. confirmed a role for unconjugated ISG15 in the stimulation of IFN gamma production and correlated this function with increased disease susceptibility in humans 69 . In this study ISG15 deficiency was identified as a potential predisposition for Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease. These authors found that recombinant ISG15 induced IFN gamma production by both NK cells and other lymphocytes. They went on to show that the levels of IFN gamma produced after stimulation with recombinant ISG15 was greatly enhanced by co-stimulation of cells with ISG15 and IL-12. Whole blood cells from ISG15 deficient individuals produced decreased levels of IFN gamma compared to cells from ISG15 sufficient individuals after stimulation with either mycobacteria alone or in combination with IL-12. Treatment of ISG15 deficient cells with recombinant ISG15 in addition to mycobacteria and IL-12 enhanced their ability to produce IFN gamma to levels near ISG15 sufficient cells.

Studies of ISG15 deficient mice have clearly established that ISG15 mediates protection from virus induced lethality, however the molecular mechanisms mediating this protection are still not well understood. Protection has been shown to occur through a variety of mechanisms involving both its conjugation to host and viral proteins as well as the function of unconjugated ISG15 in the regulation of the immune response. We must note that while this review has focused on the role of ISG15 in humans and mice, many other vertebrates including fish, sheep, and cows have been shown to encode ISG15 homologs 8 . The fish ISG15 homolog has been shown to inhibit virus replication in vitro, and a secreted form of fish ISG15 has been shown to have cytokine-like properties, thus highlighting the conserved antiviral functions of ISG15 homologs between species 75; 76 . The ISG15 conjugation system has been intimately tied to protein translation, preferentially targeting newly translated proteins for ISG15 modification 25 Likewise, multiple studies have demonstrated a role for ISGylation of key antiviral ISGs, suggesting that ISG15 conjugation is important for proper regulation of the host antiviral response. Understanding this relationship between ISGylation and protein translation may play a key role in future discoveries of ISG15 functions. However, this observation also raises an important concern about the context within which ISG15 is studied. When possible, functional characterizations of ISG15 conjugation should be verified under conditions of endogenous protein expression. If new protein translation of target proteins truly is essential for ISGylation, phenotypes generated in overexpression systems with ectopic expression of target proteins may be real but also biologically artifactual.",

            "text": "While the ISGylation of viral proteins has been reported, and in at least some systems may contribute to the antiviral activity of ISG15, virus replication has not been altered in several models where ISG15 is known to play a role during virus infection in vivo. For example, ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice display increased lethality following Sindbis virus infection, however, no defect in virus replication was observed when WT and ISG15\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were infected with Sindbis virus 40 . Similarly, ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice are more susceptible to HSV-1 infection, however no difference in HSV-1 replication has been observed in ISG15\u2212/\u2212 MEFs or in fibroblasts from human patients deficient for ISG15 40; 69 . Discrepancies between in vivo protection and cell culture phenotypes might be a result of the particular cell types chosen for study. However, it is also possible that ISG15 mediated protection from lethality might not be a result of direct antagonism of virus replication, as has been demonstrated for CHIKV infection 43 . To date, very little has been reported on the role of ISG15 conjugation in the regulation of the immune response. The initial characterization of ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice revealed no difference in the virus specific T-cell response after infection of WT and ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice with LCMV 39 . Importantly, however, no lethality phenotype was noted between WT and ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice after LCMV infection. Given the discrepancies between certain in vivo survival phenotypes and cell culture replication phenotypes, it may be informative to more thoroughly examine the role of ISG15 conjugation in the immune response in the context of an infection in which ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice display increased susceptibility.",

            "text": "Finally, recent findings support the need for further investigation into the function of the unconjugated form of ISG15. Released ISG15 has been shown to modulate IFN gamma production by multiple cell types, and has been suggested to play a role in defense against mycobacteria 68; 69 . Unconjugated ISG15 also appears to regulate cytokine production after certain viral infections, though it is unclear if this is through the extracellular or intracellular form of ISG15 43 . In addition to providing evidence that ISG15 may function to regulate the immune response, both of these activities suggest the presence of ISG15 specific binding partners. In the case of extracellular ISG15 the identification of a putative cellular receptor will be critical in better understanding the biological significance of extracellular ISG15. Intracellular ISG15 may also interact with other unidentified intracellular proteins independent of conjugation. Recent work in the ubiquitin field has demonstrated that unanchored ubiquitin chains can bind to innate signaling molecules such as RIG-I and members of the NF-\u03baB signaling cascade to influence signaling through these important pathways 77; 78 . This raises the possibility that other ubiquitin-like proteins could function in a similar manner. The body of research on non-covalent binding partners of ISG15 is quite small compared to the conjugation dependent interactions, but these interactions may influence important biological processes. Uncovering potential binding partners for ISG15 will be instrumental in understanding its molecular mechanism of action.",

Ubiquitin can also conjugate to itself on multiple lysine residues to form polyubiquitin chains on target proteins which result in different downstream functional consequences for the targeted protein. B) The ISG15 conjugation cascade is an IFN induced cascade in which the vast majority of ISG15 conjugation utilizes UbE1L, UbcH8, and HERC5.
