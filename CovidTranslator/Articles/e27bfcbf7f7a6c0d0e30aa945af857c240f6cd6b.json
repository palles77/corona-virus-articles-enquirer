            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) proteins belong to a large group of proteins that is diYcult to express in traditional expression systems. The ability to express and purify SARS-CoV proteins in large quantities is critical for basic research and for development of pharmaceutical agents. The work reported here demonstrates: (1) fusion of SUMO (small ubiquitinrelated modiWer), a 100 amino acid polypeptide, to the N-termini of SARS-CoV proteins dramatically enhances expression in Escherichia coli cells and (2) 6\u00a3 His-tagged SUMO-fusions facilitate rapid puriWcation of the viral proteins on a large scale. We have exploited the natural chaperoning properties of SUMO to develop an expression system suitable for proteins that cannot be expressed by traditional methodologies. A unique feature of the system is the SUMO tag, which enhances expression, facilitates puri-Wcation, and can be eYciently cleaved by a SUMO-speciWc protease to generate native protein with a desired N-terminus. We have puriWed various SARS-CoV proteins under either native or denaturing conditions. These puriWed proteins have been used to generate highly speciWc polyclonal antibodies. Our study suggests that the SUMO-fusion technology will be useful for enhancing expression and puriWcation of the viral proteins for structural and functional studies as well as for therapeutic uses. \uf6d9",

This information aVords the opportunity to express any SARS-CoV protein of choice for recombinant subunit vaccines. Development of protein-based diagnostic and therapeutic methods would be greatly facilitated by the ability to produce viral proteins of high quality in tractable amounts, which requires protein engineering, expression, and puriWcation. Six proteins of SARS-CoV, namely Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (Nc), Envelope (E), SARS polymerase (RdRp), SARS protease (3CL), and membrane (M), have become the focus of eVorts to produce antiviral agents and vaccines against SARS.

The full length of the 3CL has 306 amino acids (molecular weight \u00bb33.8 kDa). The protease cleaves the replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) to generate RNA-dependent polymerase (RdRp), 3CL, and helicase, all crucial for viral replication [5] [6] [7] . Therefore, 3CL represents an attractive target for the design and discovery of coronavirus antiviral agents, as does the polymerase [8] . SARS-CoV Nucleocapsid protein (N or Nc) is a phosphoprotein containing 423 amino acids (molecular weight \u00bb46 kDa) [9] . Large quantities of the protein are translated on free polysomes in the cytoplasm, where some molecules are rapidly phosphorylated. It is known that the protein binds the viral RNA and forms the nucleocapsid, but its exact mechanisms and role in replication are not yet clear. The Nc protein is known to have B and T cell epitopes and to elicit host protective immune responses [10, 11] . Spike protein (S or Spk) is a glycoprotein containing 1255 amino acids [12] . Upon translation, it is inserted into the rough endoplasmic reticulum and glycosylated with N-linked glycans [13] . Some of the proteins accumulate in the Golgi apparatus, and a fraction of oligomeric spike protein is transported to the membrane, where it mediates cell-cell fusion. Like those of other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV spike protein likely contains many of the neutralizing antibody epitopes as well as T cell epitopes [14] .",

            "text": "Small ubiquitin-related modiWer (SUMO) is a ubiquitin-related protein that functions by covalent attachment to other proteins. SUMO and its associated enzymes are present in all eukaryotes and are highly conserved from yeast to humans [19] [20] [21] . SUMO has 18% sequence identity with ubiquitin [22] . The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has only a single SUMO gene (SMT3) that is essential for viability [20] . In contrast to yeast SMT3, three members of SUMO have been described in vertebrates: SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3. Human SUMO-1, a 101 amino acid polypeptide, shares 50% sequence identity with human SUMO-2/SUMO-3 [23] , which are close homologues. Yeast SUMO shares 47% sequence identity with mammalian SUMO-1. Although overall sequence identity between ubiquitin and SUMO is only 18%, structure determination by NMR reveals that they share a common three-dimensional structure characterized by a tightly packed globular fold with -sheets wrapped around a single -helix [24, 25] . It is known that SUMO, fused at the N-terminus with other proteins, can fold and protect the protein by its chaperoning properties, making it a useful tag for heterologous expression [26] . All SUMO genes encode precursor proteins with a short Cterminal sequence that extends from the conserved C-terminal Gly-Gly motif. SUMO proteases remove SUMO from proteins, by cleaving the C-termini of SUMO (-GGATY) in yeast to the mature form (-GG) or deconjugating it from lysine side chains [27, 28] . The former activity (protease) is useful for removal of SUMO as an expression tag. There are 2 SUMO proteases in yeast [27, 28] and at least 6 in humans, the human enzymes ranging from 238 to 1112 amino acid residues [22, [29] [30] [31] .",

It contains an N-terminal hexahistidine (6\u00a3 His) tag, introduced by PCR into the SUMO coding sequence, as well as a unique BsaI site at the C-terminus. The cloning strategy to express fusion proteins employed this BsaI site to insert the SARS-CoV protein coding sequences in frame with SUMO. PCR primers (Table 1) incorporating this site or Esp 3I were used to amplify the SARS-CoV coding sequences from cDNA clones carried in pTOPO vectors. The 3\u0408 primers carried a BamHI site for insertion into the multiple cloning site of pET24d. The primer pairs used to PCR amplify the SARS-CoV protein genes are listed in Table 1 . Because of its large size, Spike protein was designed as two half-molecules, S1 (N-terminal fragment, amino acids 1-667, SpK N) and S2 (C-terminal fragment, amino acids 668-1193, SpK C) domains and the Spk C was tested for expression and puriWcation in this study.

Using Ni-NTA aYnity to purify the 6\u00a3 His-tagged SUMO-fusion was an eYcient method, since only a single, high-density protein band was detected in the eluted fractions (Fig. 6) . After the puriWed sample was dialyzed and the SUMO protease added under the conditions described above, complete cleavage of the fusion was achieved. A single, highly intense band (\u00bb46 kDa) was detected in the Wnal puriWed sample, indicating that >95% pure SARS-CoV Nc was obtained (Fig. 6) . In this experiment, approximately 26 mg of the Nc was puriWed from the 1 L E. coli culture ( Table 2 ).

Fig. 7 shows that the SUMO-3CL-fusion antibody reacted speciWcally with the puriWed 3CL, with a little cross-reactivity with Nc; likewise, SUMO-Nc-fusion antibody had a highly speciWc reaction to puriWed Nc, without any cross-reaction with 3CL. The results not only conWrmed the identities of the SARS-CoV proteins but also suggested that the puriWed SARS proteins maintained their immunity response properties.",

BrieXy, the 6\u00a3 His-tagged SUMO-Spike C-fusion was eluted by elution buVer containing 300 mM imidazole, but a few other minor proteins that were without 6\u00a3 His tags but possibly rich in histidine and/or cysteine were also bound to the resin, resulting in impurities of the sample.

Problems are encountered, however, when these tags must be removed to study the protein's structure by X-ray crystallography or NMR. Although several proteases such as thrombin, Factor Xa, and AcTEV protease are used for these purposes, all of these enzymes recognize short degenerate sequences, and, thus, cleavage can occur within the proteins of interest. Another problem encountered is inaccessibility of the cleavage site within the fusion due to steric constraints, which could reduce the eVectiveness of enzymic cleavage. The SUMO tag, by contrast, is accurately and eYciently removed from the protein of interest [26] . Comparing the cleavage of SUMO-GFP by SUMO protease to the cleavage of NusA-GFP by AcTEV protease, we found that SUMO protease had a 64-fold higher activity than AcTEV protease when the same amount of enzyme was used (unpublished results). Ubiquitin has been reported to exert chaperoning eVects on fused proteins, thus increasing expression of proteins in E. coli and yeast [34] [35] [36] . The fused proteins can be cleaved by Ub-proteases (both UCH and UBP classes), but the enzymes are unstable, diYcult to produce, and often must be used in large quantities (an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:1), making this technology impractical for large-scale protein production [18] . Our laboratory has exploited the chaperoning properties of several ubiquitin-like proteins including SUMO, and the extreme robustness of SUMO protease has allowed us to develop a technology that provides both enhanced expression and cleavage of the fusion protein. A number of diYcult proteins have been expressed in our laboratory in both unfused and SUMO-fused forms and compared side-by-side to demonstrate that SUMO-fusion dramatically enhances the expression of many types of proteins, including membrane proteins, and that SUMO protease cleaves a variety of SUMO-fusions with high speciWcity and eYciency over a wide range of various conditions, including pH (5.5-10.5) and temperature (4-37\u00b0C) [26] . Non-speciWc cleavage of the substrate was not observed, even when the amount of enzyme was deliberately increased to a 1:1 ratio [26] . In this study, titration of the hydrolytic capacity of SUMO protease on the puriWed SARS-CoV Nc proteins conWrmed that SUMO protease is an extremely potent enzyme (Fig. 8) . The predicted molecular weight of the SUMO protease is 26.7 kDa, though it usually runs at \u00bb31 kDa position on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel.",
