In further work, a chicken line in which high mortality occurred (line 15 I) and one (line C) in which no mortality was recorded were selected and a number of different parameters of the disease, such as clinical signs, damage to tracheal epithelium and virus growth in tissues compared [15] . It was found that, whilst both lines were equally susceptible to infection initially, recovery was much more rapid in the line C chicks. Histological studies [14] showed that the type of damage which IBV infection caused to the mucociliary system of the respiratory tract was similar in both lines but that the damage was more severe and longer lasting in line 15 I. This was confirmed by ultrastructural studies and by histochemical methods, which showed that IBV antigens could be detected in paraffin embedded tracheal sections of line 151 chicks for longer than line C chicks. The finding that explants of tissues from the two lines were equally susceptible to in vitro inoculation with IBV led to the conclusion [15] that resistance to IBV infection was not due to lack of specific viral receptors, as is the case with murine hepatitis coronavirus [1] , and it was suggested that immunological factors may be involved.",

In a preliminary experiment 4-week-old bursectomised (Bx) and intact chicks were injected with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) or Brucella abortus antigen. Samples of blood were obtained to determine the presence of B lymphocytes using an indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) staining technique with a rabbit anti-bursacyte serum or rabbit anti-chicken immunoglobulin serum. Serum obtained after 7 days was used in micro-agglutination tests to detect the presence of antibodies to SRBC and B. abortus. There was complete agreement between the tests. Those chickens which had been completely bursectomised lacked circulating B-cells and were unable to develop an antibody response to either SRBC or B. abortus. Therefore in these experiments the efficacy of bnrsectomy was assessed by measuring circulating antibodies against IBV using an ELISA (see later). Those birds with evidence of circulating antibody were rejected from the experiments.",

Three chicks in each group were killed after 4 and 7 days and their tracheas examined for ciliary activity. The chicks inoculated with IBV for the first time showed mean ciliostasis scores of 4.0, the maximum score possible (Table 4 ), indicating that they were fully susceptible to IBV infection. The low scores in the intact, rechallenged group indicated that they were protected against rechallenge, whilst the Bx, rechallenged chicks were found to be only partially protected.",

            "text": "Mature B lymphocytes begin to migrate from the bursa of Fabricius and seed the peripheral lymphoid organs from day 18 of embryonic development [5] . Hence complete removal of the bursa on day 17 should result in a chick which lacks both B lymphocytes and the ability to generate specific antibody responses [5, 18; present study] . Surgical bursectomy at 17 days incubation is an efficient and specific way of depleting the B-dependent immune system without impairing cell-mediated immune responses. Incompletely bursectomised chicks can readily be identified by the presence of circulating antibody and in these three experiments only 13 out of 111 (11%) of those chicks bursectomised in ovo were discounted on this criterion. However, it must be pointed out that those chicks sampled on days 2 and 5 did not have a sufficiently high titre of antibody to allow this criterion to be used and the completeness of bursectomy in this case was confirmed by post mortem examination. In this study, two different IBV inocula were used: the pool of virulent strains, which had been used previously and shown to cause high levels of mortality in susceptible chicks, when inoculated alone [2] or together with pathogenic serotypes of Escherichia coli [4, 19] , and the M41 strain [14, 15] . The M41 strain had been selected because it was considered undesirable to cause high levels of mortality in chicks to be used for virus assays -such assays on moribund chicks being likely to be inaccurate. For the same reason, it was initially decided to use the M 41 strain in the present studies. However, in two experiments with that strain rather different results were recorded. In one of them only mild clinical signs were observed in both the Bx and intact chicks and virus was recovered from tissues from both groups in very small amounts and for only a short time. A third experiment was therefore carried out, challenging with the IB Pool. A more severe respiratory infection was recorded and amounts of IBV recovered and the duration of recovery were similar to that found in one experiment where M 41 was used. The reason for this discrepancy is not immediately clear, however, previous findings (H. W. Smith et al., unpubl.) have indicated that the severity of infection which the M 41 strain of IBV causes in chickens inoculated with IBV alone or together with pathogenic strains of E. coli can be highly variable.",

The Bx line C chicks did not behave completely like line 151 chicks, however, because negligible mortality was recorded in them, even after inoculation with the pool of virulent IBV strains, which consistently causes high mortality (greater than 80%) in the line 151 chicks [2] .

Although numbers of chicks in the secondary challenge experiment were small, it was clear that the degree of damage to the ciliated epithelium of the trachea in Bx chicks, which had been unable to mount a humoral response to the primary IBV inoculation, was much more severe than that in the intact chicks.
