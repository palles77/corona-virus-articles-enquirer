We also understand and appreciate the challenges she describes in systematically identifying and reporting pregnancies during a public health emergency response such as occurred with SARS. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, we have recognized that it is critical that pregnancy information be collected systematically as part of the medical intake process. This can be accomplished by asking a simple, short question about pregnancy status (i.e.,\"Are you or do you think you could be pregnant?\") as women are being evaluated and processed as part of an emergency response plan. Urine pregnancy testing may be used to verify pregnancy status for women who are unsure (2) . Besides helping tailor the provision of healthcare in these settings, pregnancy status information should also be used to track pregnancy outcomes.",

In June 2003 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the first evidence of community-acquired monkeypox in the United States. Because this outbreak was linked to infected prairie dogs often kept as pets by small children, exposed household members included mothers, some of whom were pregnant. Unfortunately, although outbreaks of monkeypox in Africa had previously been well described, these descriptions did not include much information on the natural history of monkeypox among pregnant women (3). This example highlights the importance of ensuring that pregnancy information is systematically collected to plan and respond to future outbreaks.",
