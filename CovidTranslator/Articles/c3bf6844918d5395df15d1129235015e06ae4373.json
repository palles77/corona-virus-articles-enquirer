Previous studies demonstrated that MMTV could induce pH 5-dependent fusion-from-without of mouse cells. Here we show that the MMTV envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion requires both the entry receptor and low pH (pH 5). Although expression of the MMTV envelope and TfR1 was sufficient to mediate low pH-dependent syncytia formation, virus infection required trafficking to a low pH compartment; infection was independent of cathepsin-mediated proteolysis. Human TfR1 did not support virus infection, although envelope-mediated syncytia formation occurred with human cells after pH 5 treatment and this fusion depended on TfR1 expression. However, although the MMTV envelope bound human TfR1, virus was only internalized and trafficked to a low pH compartment in cells expressing mouse TfR1. Thus, while human TfR1 supported cell-cell fusion, because it was not internalized when bound to MMTV, it did not function as an entry receptor. Our data suggest that MMTV uses TfR1 for all steps of entry: cell attachment, induction of the conformational changes in Env required for membrane fusion and internalization to an appropriate acidic compartment.",

There have been reports that continuous passage of MMTV on human breast cancer cell lines resulted in adapted viruses that could infect human cells (Howard & Schlom, 1980; Lasfargues, Coutinho et al., 1979) and more recently, Indik and colleagues reported infection of several human cell lines with a GFP-marked MMTV (Indik, Gunzburg et al., 2005) . Additionally, several groups have detected MMTV-like sequences in up to 40% of human breast cancer samples, but not normal tissue (Etkind, Du et al., 2000; Ford, Tran et al., 2003; Liu, Wang et al., 2001; Pogo, Melana et al., 1999; Szabo, Haislip et al., 2005; Wang, Holland et al., 1995; Zammarchi, Pistello et al., 2006) . MMTVlike sequences have also been detected in patients with the autoimmune disease, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) (Xu, Shen et al., 2003) . Other groups, however, have been unable to find such sequences (Bindra, Muradrasoli et al., 2007; Mant, Gillett et al., 2004; Selmi, Ross et al., 2004) .",

We also show that although MMTV uses mTfR1 and not hTfR1 for infection, low pH induced cell-cell fusion occurred on human cells that express the MMTV envelope (Env) and both Env and hTfR1 were required for this event. However, MMTV was unable to mediate internalization of hTfR1. Thus, because MMTV requires trafficking to a low pH compartment to enter cells, it was unable to infect human cells despite engaging the hTfR1 receptor. These data provide further evidence that MMTV is unlikely to be a causal agent in human breast cancer.",

Mm5MT cells were grown in the presence or absence of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone to induce viral protein expression (Fig. 1A ) and then treated with pH 5 media for 15 min.; we determined experimentally that 15 min. incubation gave the highest levels of fusion (not shown).

To determine whether this was true for MMTV, we created MMTV Env pseudotyped MLV particles, as previously described (Zhang, Rassa et al., 2003) and incubated them at pH 5 for 15 min. at 37\u00b0C. The pseudoviruses were then used to infect 293T cells stably expressing mTfR1 (mTfR1/293T) (Zhang, Rassa, deObaldia, Albritton, & Ross, 2003) . Low pH (pH 5) pre-treatment had no effect on the infection levels ( Fig. 2A) , indicating that the MMTV Env does not undergo an irreversible change in the absence of receptor.",

NMuMG cells (normal mouse mammary gland cells that express mTfR1) were incubated with MMTV on ice for 1 hr, shifted to 37\u00b0C for 15 min., then fixed and immunostained with anti-MMTV and anti-EEA1 or anti-rab 7 antibodies, which are markers of early and late endosomal compartments, respectively. MMTV was detected in both compartments, indicating that virus efficiently enters this pathway and consistent with the pH 5 requirement for Env mediated cellcell fusion (Fig. 3A) . We also found that mTfR1 co-localized with a GFP-tagged version of the early endosomal marker rab5 in the presence or absence of virus, while it only was found in the same compartment as a rab7-GFP (late endosomal marker) in the presence of virus (not shown).

Treatment with either drug dramatically reduced the level of infection compared to cells that underwent the same infection protocol in the absence of drug (Fig. 4B ). We also tested whether MMTV required two-step activation of fusion at the plasma membrane as is needed for ASLV (Barnard, Elleder et al., 2006; Delos, Godby et al., 2005; Matsuyama, Delos et al., 2004) . MMTV was incubated with mTfR1/293T cells at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr in the presence of bafilomycin A, the media was removed and then the cells were treated with pH 7 or pH 5 buffer for 15 min at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 4C ).

VSV G pseudotypes served as a negative control, Ebola virus GP pseudotypes as a positive control. None of these inhibitors significantly affected MMTV infection of either NMuMG (Fig. 6A ) or mTfR1/293T (Figs. 6B and 6C) cells at the highest concentrations tested. For example, 150\u00b5M E64d inhibited neither MMTV nor VSV pseudovirus infection ( Fig. 6A and 6C), while this concentration completely inhibited infection by Ebola virus G protein pseudotypes (Fig. 6B ); higher concentrations of E64d were toxic to cells.

For example, the fusion activity of the influenza HA can be triggered by pH alone and does not depend on the presence of specific cell surface proteins (Skehel & Wiley, 2000) . For other viruses, like avian sarcoma/leukemia virus (ASLV), receptor binding is needed to prime the viral Env for subsequent low pH treatment (Mothes, Boerger et al., 2000) (Delos, Godby, & White, 2005) . We next used Env-mediated syncytia formation to determine if fusion of Env-mediated cell-cell fusion was TfR1-as well as pH-dependent. We co-transfected 293T cells with expression vectors containing the MMTV Env together with wild type hTfR1 or a chimeric molecule, hTfR1-MTM52. MTM52 has a hTfR1 backbone, but contains amino acids 285-296 and seven amino acid substitutions in the region from amino acids 569-589 from mTfR1. Introduction of these changes into the extra-cellular domain of hTfR1 renders it capable of serving as an MMTV entry receptor (Wang, Albritton, & Ross, 2006) . Surprisingly, the MMTV Env induced syncytia formation to similar extents in cells expressing either hTfR1 or MTM52; indeed, Env also caused 293T cells expressing only endogenous levels of TfR1 to fuse after pH 5 treatment (Fig. 7A) . Moreover, the MMTV Env induced syncytia on D17 dog and CFRK cat cells after pH 5 treatment (not shown); neither the dog nor the cat TfR1 support MMTV pseudovirus infection (Wang, Albritton, & Ross, 2006) .",

Additionally, sequence comparison and mutagenesis studies showed that all functional MMTV entry receptors (mouse and rat) have a similar pattern of charged amino acids in the binding site, compared to nonfunctional receptors (human, cat, dog). However, the cell-cell fusion data presented in the preceding section indicated that MMTV might bind hTfR1. To determine if this was the case, we performed co-transfection/co-immunoprecipitation studies with expression plasmids encoding the MMTV Env, hTfR1 or MTM52 (Wang, Albritton, & Ross, 2006) . When anti-MMTV Env antiserum was used for the immunoprecipitation step and anti-hTfR1 antibodies for the detection step, equal levels of both MTM52 and hTfr1 were precipitated, even under high stringency conditions (0.5M KI) (Fig. 8) . Thus, at least in an over-expression assay, both the hTfR1 and mTfR1 bind to the MMTV Env.",

Previously, we showed that MMTV binding to the surface of mouse cells resulted in decreased surface expression of TfR1, indicating that the virus triggered receptor internalization (Ross, Schofield, Farr, & Bucan, 2002) . To determine if MMTV induced internalization of the hTfR1, 293T or mTfR1/293T cells were spinoculated for 2 hr at RT with MMTV virions, immunostained with anti-human or anti-mouse TfR1 antibodies and analyzed by FACS.

Typically, receptors follow three potential routes after exiting the sorting endosome, trafficking either back to the cell surface via the recycling endosome, to the trans-Golgi network or, if targeted for degradation to the late endosome/lysosome (\u2264pH 5.5) (Gruenberg & Stenmark, 2004) . In its normal metabolic role, TfR1 traffics first to the sorting endosome (~pH 6) upon binding diferric Tf and then moves either directly or via the recycling endosome (also ~pH 6) back to the surface where apoTf is released. Given that MMTV Env-mediated membrane fusion occurs at pH 5 but not pH 6 and its association with the late endosome (Fig. 3A) , it is likely that binding of virus re-targets TfR1 to this compartment. Indeed, our preliminary studies indicate that this is the case (not shown). MMTV may re-direct TfR1 to the late endosome to gain better access to the nucleus, since the sorting endosome is believed to be located in the cell periphery, while the late and recycling endosomes are found in the perinuclear region.",

TTP is a newly identified molecule which has been shown to be important for internalization of TfR1, probably through its interaction with dynamin (Tosoni, Puri, Confalonieri, Salcini, De Camilli, Tacchetti, & Di Fiore, 2005) . We have also found that over-expression of a dominant-negative form of dynamin had little or no effect on MMTV infection (not shown). Eps15, which is associated with the adaptor protein AP-2, has been implicated in the endocytosis and entry of a number of enveloped viruses, including Sindbis virus and VSV (Carbone, Fre et al., 1997; Sun, Yau, Briggs, & Whittaker, 2005) . However, MMTV infection occurred at almost wild type levels in cells expressing the dominant-negative Eps15, indicating that its trafficking to the late endosome is largely independent of the normal endocytic pathway taken by TfR1. Several other viruses, notably severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and mouse hepatitis virus 2 (MHV2), which like MMTV require a <pH 5.5 compartment for entry, have recently been shown to infect cells in the presence of the dominantnegative Eps15 (Pu & Zhang, 2008; Wang, Yang et al., 2008) . Interestingly, it has been previously suggested that intra-cellular trafficking of TfR1 depends not only on targeting sequences found in the receptor but also on the particular ligand bound to the receptor, since a genetically engineered Tf that bound to a different region of the receptor redirected it to the lysosome and targeted it for degradation (Zaliauskiene, Kang et al., 2002) . Since MMTV interacts with a region of TfR1 distinct from Tf, it is possible that the virus also re-directs the receptor from the early recycling endosome to a more acidic compartment.",

Infection by several viruses, including Ebola, MLV, Hendra and the SARS and MHV coronaviruses have been shown to require cleavage by cysteine proteases located in the late endosome/lysosome such as B and L, to achieve efficient infection (Chandran, Sullivan et al., 2005; Kaletsky, Simmons et al., 2007; Kumar, Nachagari et al., 2007; Pager & Dutch, 2005; Qiu, Hingley et al., 2006; Schornberg, Matsuyama et al., 2006; Simmons, Gosalia et al., 2005) . However, we found no evidence that MMTV required cleavage by such enzymes, since neither specific inhibitors of cathepsin (E46d) or more general protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, etc.) affected MMTV infection levels. Kumar and colleagues have also suggested that MLV might require cathepsins at a post-membrane fusion stage of infection, since they found that VSV G/MLV pseudotype infection of NIH3T3 cells was inhibited by cathepsin inhibitor III and CA-074 (Kumar, Nachagari, Fields, Franks, & Albritton, 2007) . In our studies, VSV G/MLV pseudotype infection was not affected by any of the cathepsin inhibitors; this difference could be due to our use of NMuMG (mouse mammary epithelial) and 293T (human kidney epithelial) cells as opposed to NIH3T3 cells used in the previous study.",

Previously we showed that MMTV used mouse but not human TfR1 as its entry receptor and that the regions of receptor required for infection mapped to two segments that formed a potential binding site consisting of a unique charged amino acid-distribution pattern (Wang, Albritton, & Ross, 2006) . However, here we show that MMTV binds both human and mouse TfR1 [ Fig. 8] and that the Env protein mediates cell-cell fusion in its presence at low pH (Fig.  7) . However, neither infectious virus particles nor pseudovirions were capable of triggering receptor internalization (Fig. 9 ). Although the MMTV Env binds hTfR1 even under high stringency conditions, it is possible that this binding is weaker than to the mouse receptor. Thus, under the conditions of high Env expression achieved after transfection, there would be a sufficient number of Env molecules that undergo the conformational change required to induce Env-mediated cell-cell fusion. Alternatively, MMTV may bind to a site on hTfR1 that does not trigger receptor internalization via the YTRF motif in the cytoplasmic tail; the YTRF motif has been shown to be important for Tf-mediated TfR1 endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits (Collawn, Lai et al., 1993) .",

            "text": "It is not surprising that low pH alone does not trigger an irreversible conformational change in the MMTV Env, since the virus is acquired through milk and must survive the low pH environment of the digestive tract. Importantly, we show here that to achieve entry, MMTV must redirect the TfR1 not to its normal recycling compartment, but to a lower pH compartment such as the late endosome/lysosome. Why does MMTV require trafficking with TfR1 to a pH 5 compartment? Clearly, neither receptor binding nor low pH is sufficient, since virus did not enter cells that express elevated levels of human or mouse TfR1 at the cell surface even when incubated at pH 5. Marsh and Bron have previously reported that fusion at the cell surface does not allow Semliki Forest virus (SFV) infection and suggested that the trafficking to an endocytic compartment could provide a means for bringing viral particles to sites in the cell where replication can proceed (Marsh & Bron, 1997) . It is possible there are late endosomal co-factors or co-receptors other than cathepsins that are necessary for infection by MMTV and other viruses, a possibility which is currently under investigation.",

Mm5MT cells induced overnight with dexamethasone were treated with media at the indicated pH. Twenty-four hr later, the cells were stained with Giemsa and the percentage of cells in syncytia (B) and the number of nuclei/syncytium (C) were determined by counting. Pseudoviruses were incubated with mTfR1/293T cells for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C, pulsed at the indicated pH and then infection at 37\u00b0C was allowed to proceed. Colonies were counted 48 hr later.",
