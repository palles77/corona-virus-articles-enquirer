In undiagnosed infections posing a significant health burden worldwide, such as latent tuberculosis or asymptomatic recurrent malaria, an important challenge is to develop accurate diagnostic tools. Antigen-specific T cells create a persistent memory to pathogens, making them useful for diagnosis of infection. Stimulation of memory response initiates T-cell transitions between functional states. Numerous studies have shown that changes in protein levels lag real-time T-cell transitions. However, analysis at the single-cell transcriptional level can determine the differences. FISH-Flow is a powerful tool with which to study the functional states of T-cell subsets and to identify the gene expression profiles of antigen-specific T cells during disease progression. Advances in instrumentation, fluorophores, and FISH methodologies will broaden and deepen the use of FISH-Flow, changing the immunological field by allowing determination of functional immune signatures at the mRNA level and the development of new diagnostic tools.",

            "text": "Flow cytometry has revolutionized immunology and now allows rapid characterization of diverse immune cell subtypes, supports studies of infection, and provides new methods for diagnosis of disease. These uses developed through the gradual adoption of several separate technologies and biophysical principles ranging from lasers to light scattering and from the application of fluorophore-antibody conjugates and monoclonal antibodies to the fluidics underlying ink-jet printing. In 1949, Walter Coulter engineered the principles of particle analysis by light scattering to invent the Coulter counter, the first clinically successful instrument for blood cell counting and analysis. 15 In 1965, the first instrument that served as a flow cytometer was reported by Kamentsky at the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University, who added light absorption measurements to quantify total protein and DNA content in cells. 16 In 1972, a later model instrument from Kamentsky was adapted by Leonard Herzenberg of Stanford University, who applied flow cytometry to immunological research to differentiate subsets of cells derived from mouse spleen using fluorescent antibodies. 15, 17 From its early days, flow cytometry was combined with cell sorting as a means to test for accuracy in cell identification. 15 In 1965, Fulwyler developed an improved method to sort cells in solution by adapting the principles underlying the invention of ink-jet printing for atomization and electrostatic deflection of droplets. 18 In 1969, Hulett et al. applied this method to a fluorescence-based flow cytometer and was able to separate cells with even better accuracy. 15, 19 Although, initially, flow cytometers were used in the clinical setting, further advances in instrumentation and reagents pushed the technology into research applications. Research flow cytometers were first developed by Van Dilla and Mack at Los Alamos in 1968. In 1975, Salzman and others first demonstrated that white blood cells could be separated into subpopulations with forward and side scatter, a feature of all modern flow cytometers. 15 Also in 1975, K\u00f6hler and Milstein invented hybridoma technology and produced the first monoclonal antibodies, 20 which led to a revolutionary change in the capabilities of flow cytometry. 21 Monoclonal antibodies coupled to fluorescent dyes could be produced for virtually any antigen. Now, in addition to forward and side scatter, highly specific immune cell subsets could be resolved with precision based on surface receptors recognized by fluorescent antibodies. Further refinement of methods for using antibodies allowed detection of intracellular cytokines and other protein markers within heterogeneous populations of thousands of cells in parallel. 22 By the 1980s, some laboratories were already working with four-color flow cytometers, which allowed simultaneous separation of lymphocyte populations and probing of intracellular cytokines or other protein markers, allowing a clearer picture to be formed of the functions of individual cells. However, it was not until the 1990s that four-color flow cytometers began to be used routinely. 23 In the 1990s, the Herzenberg laboratory at Stanford made advances in flow cytometer design that allowed for the measurement of more than 10 colors. 21 This coincided with an increased awareness of the complexity of the immune system and the necessity to be able to identify immune cell subsets and simultaneously profile their functions under different conditions. These new capabilities have since helped to identify hundreds of phenotypically distinct cell types in human peripheral blood. For example, T cells and related subsets can be identified using fluorescently labeled antibodies specific for the CD3 and either CD4 or CD8 cellsurface proteins. In addition, within T-cell populations, various markers have been proposed to distinguish naive, effector, and memory cell populations. An 11-color flow cytometer was reported in 2001 24 and, since then, even 14-color instruments have become routine in immunological core facilities and laboratories around the world. 21 Therefore, during the interval in which the Coulter counter evolved into the modern flow cytometer, the availability of lasers and further development of fluorescent dyes led to expanded design options of flow cytometers and drove a shift to fluorescence-based detection instead of absorbance. The consequences were efficient excitation of fluorescence in cells passing through a high-energy, single-wavelength beam directed at the flow channel, much greater sensitivity compared with absorbance, and easier simultaneous measurements of different surface markers or molecules within the same cell at once, allowing multi-parametric analysis.",

With smFISH, individual mRNA molecules are detected using 50 different probes, each coupled with a fluorescent molecule and synthesized so that they hybridize along the length of an mRNA transcript. 25, 26 Cells are fixed and permeabilized, usually in formaldehyde and ethanol (or mild detergent), respectively, and hybridized with the probes. Imaging with fluorescence microscopy after hybridization allows visualization of each mRNA molecule within a small number of cells as diffraction-limited spots. These spots can be identified and counted from optical sections of cells using image-processing programs. The counts of the spots accurately reflects the expression levels of mRNAs in cells. 27, 28 The high specificity and single-molecule sensitivity of this approach has been demonstrated by many laboratories in different biological applications. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] In contrast to combining smFISH with microscopy, using flow cytometry and including negative controls for transcripts that are not present in a cell allows identification of rare cells in a large population based on profiling of mRNA expression in single cells.

Although methods of multi-parameter measurement of proteins in single cells are known, 36 there is a need to develop similar tools for RNA analytes so that protein and RNA markers can be analyzed in a combinatorial or correlational manner. This will allow for more comprehensive analysis of pathways and networks that underlie many diseases and pathologies. Antibody-based detection is semi-quantitative, in part because binding of several antibodies creates different levels of background. In contrast, FISH-Flow quantifies the absolute level of gene expression in each cell. Moreover, in further contrast to antibody staining, FISH-Flow is amenable to measuring both increases and decreases in gene expression at timespans ranging from minutes to hours through detection of an RNA analyte. 13 Loss of protein expression is not readily observable with antibody staining because most proteins degrade more slowly than most transcripts. This allows real-time insights into the functioning of cells. Profiling changes in gene expression also provides a real-time examination of incipient functional changes before protein accumulation. A fourth difference is that antibody detection of protein requires the laborious empirical process of antibody selection for a specific antigen, whereas, in principle, rational design of probes from bioinformatics data allows measuring the expression of any gene with FISH-Flow.",

Up to now, however, these efforts have been hampered by limitations in technologies to achieve single-cell measurements of mRNA transcription. Ensemble measurements of gene expression do not provide the same insight into functional differences at the single-cell level, which are much more predictive of future tendencies of the population than the mean of the whole T-cell repertoire. Moreover, other approaches to identifying infections and disease stages do not utilize the power of antigen-specific stimulation, for example, in distinguishing TB from LTBI. 37, 38 Combining multiple platforms such as transcriptomics, epigenomics, and proteomics may serve the purpose, 38 but would be far less feasible for diagnostics than a single FISH-Flow platform.",

Then, cells from each bin were imaged individually with fluorescence microscopy to determine the number of mRNA molecules in each cell. There was a correlation between the flow cytometry read-out of fluorescence intensity and the number of mRNA transcripts within the cell. 13 This allowed us to write software with the capability to calculate the number of transcripts in every cell imaged by flow cytometry from raw intensity data (unpublished data). We also found that the sensitivity of the technique detects approximately five mRNA molecules per cell. The quantitative results from FISH-Flow also reveal kinetic signatures of gene expression, as shown for increasing and decreasing levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) mRNA. The kinetics of mRNA expression were different for each gene and showed changes on much smaller timescales than protein analytes.

            "text": "Using FISH-Flow as a platform, the study of single cells provides a new approach for identifying T-cell signatures associated with infectious disease. Because T cells maintain memory to a pathogen for years after infection, they are useful for diagnosis of disease. Especially in cases of asymptomatic latent or recurrent infection, it is important to develop powerful diagnostic tools. For each antigen encountered, the immune response generates functionally distinct subsets of T cells sharing the same antigen specificity. 39, 40 For example, in anti-viral immunity, the functional heterogeneity of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells is influenced by antigen load, 41 a direct function of infectious burden. Therefore, functional signatures of CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses can correspond to different levels of viral replication and disease. 41 Moreover, T-cell subsets may overlap in functionality. For example, some T-cell subsets can have different surface markers and yet similar functions. 41 Functional signatures arising from both heterogeneity and subset overlap track changes in Tcell responses, such as their cytokine expression profile, that follow from changes in an infection over time. 42, 43 The functional heterogeneity of T-cell subpopulations that exists in vivo with chronic viral infections also occurs with tuberculosis and other bacterial infections. 8, 41 Increasing evidence demonstrates that T-cell functions such as cytokine release are crucial in identifying the disease state. 3, 4, 41 We consider here the T-cell memory that develops in the CD8+ and CD4+ subpopulations after an initial adaptive immune response to infection. There are two main classes of memory in both subpopulations: less-differentiated central memory T (T CM ) cells and more-differentiated effector memory (T EM ) cells. The size of the T-cell memory response correlates with the initial magnitude of the T effector (T E ) cell response. 44, 45 Both T CM and T EM cells pass through the circulatory system and may interconvert during passage through lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. 46 The functionality of induced adaptive immune responses also depends on the pathways and efficiency of antigen presentation, as demonstrated for TB infection. 47, 48 Therefore, analyzing functional signatures of T-cell subsets could be a powerful strategy for diagnosis and study of viral and bacterial infections and other pathological conditions modulating immune responses, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. 41 It is not sufficient to address questions of T-cell function by only examining the surface markers of cells or tracking T-cell functional outputs. [3] [4] [5] [6] Even within seemingly homogeneous immunological populations, there are differences in gene transcription that exist before differentiation or proliferation and are caused by antigen encounter. It has been long postulated that T lymphocytes have certain functional programs that are activated due to presentation of previously encountered antigens to T memory cells. Certain studies on TB have attempted to use protein markers to ascertain the differences in functional signatures found in individuals with latent and active TB. 7-10,49,50 However, protein level measurements do not reveal the real-time transitions that T cells undergo from one functional state to another with enough detail to understand the process. Rather, it is necessary to pinpoint events at the single-cell transcriptional level. In order to accomplish these goals, immunologists need a much more sensitive tool at their disposal than only the ability to track individual cell protein levels. This would need to be combined with the ability to quantify mRNA expression from each cell of a heterogeneous population. Because T lymphocytes with memory for a particular antigen are so rare, using any microscopybased method to find them and perform further analyses is not feasible. The need to detect rare cells was the major rationale for the development of FISH-Flow by our research group. 13 Due to its ability to make high-throughput measurements of mRNA transcripts from thousands of single cells simultaneously, FISH-Flow is an excellent tool for studying variability in T-cell subsets and for identifying the functional signatures of antigen-specific T cells during disease progression.",

First, in the example of malaria, recurrence follows reactivation of dormant plasmodium parasites. 51 No symptoms exist during initial stages of parasite proliferation, which creates a risk for transmission of malaria because mosquitos can carry the disease to new donors before diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, delayed treatment of malarial infection can lead to serious complications and even death. 52 A second example involves human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 latency forced by drug treatment and reactivation that occurs with interruption or failure of therapy. 53 The third example is infection with M. tuberculosis, the cause of TB. Approximately two to three billion people worldwide are infected with M. tuberculosis. 54 A small proportion (5-15%) of individuals who have LTBI and seemingly healthy immune systems will experience reactivation leading to disease. A higher percentage of elderly and immune-compromised individuals undergo reactivation. During reactivation, a public health hazard exists due to transmission of infection before the development of clinical symptoms. Annually, M. tuberculosis infection causes 9.4 million new cases of active TB and 1.7 million deaths worldwide. 55 Moreover, it is not possible to distinguish individuals who have cleared TB infection either naturally or as a treatment outcome from those who may still have latent infection because the M. tuberculosis bacterium becomes sequestered in lung macrophages. Transmission of infection would be greatly reduced if, as a preventive measure, it were possible to identify and treat infected individuals as they progress to active disease.",

These IFN\u03b3 release assays (IGRAs) do not distinguish between TB and LTBI. Moreover, a positive IGRA result in an asymptomatic individual (in the absence of microbiological evidence of active tuberculosis) is uninformative for reactivation risk (for review, see Kunnath-Velayudhan et al. 1 ). Therefore, the effectiveness and acceptability of these tests is reduced, especially in countries with a high incidence of active TB and insufficient medical infrastructure, such as South Africa, where 80% of the population is infected. 56 Moreover, even in low-burden, high-resource countries such as the United States, the side effects of treatment for LTBI 57 often lead to its refusal when it is recommended without an indication of reactivation risk. 58 The limitations of current diagnostic platforms for latent and active tuberculosis therefore have enormous public health consequences worldwide.",

Therefore, it may be possible to distinguish infection stages in TB by measurements at the single-cell level in stimulated antigen-specific T lymphocytes. Biomarkers characteristic for T-cell subsets that are expected to be present in LTBI versus TB and that would distinguish, for example, T CM from T EM or T E , may provide the long-sought targets for such stage-specific identification. Moreover, there is evidence that T cells responding to antigen stimulation do not only express single or polyfunctional arrangements of cytokines, but also secrete cytokines in a programmatic, sequential fashion. 4 This programmatic sequence of release is not random, as determined by tracking IL-2, IFN\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1 over time, but reflects functional programs in response to infection. 4 Such cell-specific, context-dependent sequential programs can be used as functional signatures to predict outcomes of infection and to study the progression of infection in greater depth. The use of functional signatures of infection through single-cell mRNA measurements with FISH-Flow has the potential to overcome challenges presented by person-to-person variability in diagnosis of infection.",

The probes then hybridize to RNA or DNA and are detected with a fluorophore-coupled anti-digoxigenin antibody. Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) is responsible for Fifth disease in children, arthropathies in adults, and transient aplastic crisis. 59 B19V nucleic acids were detected in infected cells and the flow-cytometry-based method confirmed that B19V replication occurs in only a small fraction of UT7/EpoS1 cells, but in a larger proportion of PBMCs. This also demonstrates the utility of this method to test hypotheses in small subsets of a population of cells. However, the images produced by the in situ hybridization method used display diffuse fluorescence in each cell, which allows one to distinguish cells above background, but is unlikely to be useful in a highly quantitative fashion like smFISH. Moreover, its utility is demonstrated only for detection of moderately or highly abundant targets, such as viral transcripts during active infection. 50 This method nevertheless demonstrates the power of pairing flow cytometry with in situ hybridization in high-throughput infectious studies.",

More recently, improvements have been made to bDNA, called RNAscope, in which two primary probes are hybridized next to each other on the target, forming a \"platform\" onto which the extender oligonucleotide with fluorescently labeled branches can hybridize to increase the specificity of binding of the amplified bDNA complexes. 61 This method was applied in conjunction with flow cytometry to detect HIV gag RNAs in HIV-infected cells, in addition to bcr and abl mRNAs in K562 cells. 62 This method was also used by the same investigators to measure high abundance of IFN\u03b3 and CD4 transcripts together with protein expression kinetics in globally activated PBMCs, 63 but not for detection of other less abundant transcripts in a low frequency antigen-specific population.",

Recently, peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe-based FISH combined with flow cytometry was used for viral diagnosis in lymphocytes and other immune cell types, again relying on detection of relatively high-copy-number targets. PNAs are synthetic polymers with a backbone consisting of repeats of N-(2-aminoethyl)-glycine units linked by peptide bonds, with purine and pyrimidine bases linked to the backbone via a bridge of methylene and carbonyl moieties. 64 Since its invention in 1991, PNA has been used for numerous applications such as DNA and RNA detection, nucleic acid capture, inhibition of PCR hybridization, and others. [65] [66] [67] In general, PNA binds DNA more stably than DNA, but there are exceptions to this depending on the PNA sequence. 65 Kimura et al. demonstrated utility of PNA for in situ hybridization with flow cytometry read-out for the detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)positive cells in suspension using a PNA-based probe targeting EBV-encoded small RNA. 68 This result was corroborated by surface immunostaining of infected cells. The study found that 1.7-25.9% of peripheral lymphocytes were infected with EBV and identified these lymphocytes as CD3+CD4+CD8\u2212 \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. 68 Similar results with this system were reported by other investigators. 69 Locked nucleic acid (LNA) FISH probes are another method used recently with flow cytometry. LNA nucleosides are nucleic acid analogs in which the ribose ring is \"locked\" by a methylene bridge that connects the 2\u2032 oxygen atom and the 4\u2032 carbon atom, which results in reduced conformational flexibility. 70 LNA nucleosides obey Watson-Crick complementary base pairing and, upon hybridization to a DNA oligonucleotide, increase the melting temperature of the DNA by 1-3\u00b0C per LNA modification. 70 The high specificity of LNA and high thermal stability in complex with DNA makes LNA-based probes well adapted for detection of nucleic acids. 71, 72 In addition, because the physical properties of LNA are highly similar to that of DNA, it is possible to adapt LNA for use in experimental conditions optimized for DNA-based probes. Moreover, LNA can be readily commercially synthesized, either purely as LNA or with the addition of DNA or RNA bases. 70 Robertson and Thach demonstrated the successful use of LNA FISH with flow cytometry for mRNA detection. 73 This method was then applied to detect Sindbis virus-infected cells. 74 LNA probes complementary to Sindbis viral RNA were able to track the increase of viral RNA over time in early infection. Moreover, it was possible to observe not just the increase of viral RNA, but also their decreased levels over time. This represents a strength shared by FISH-Flow methodologies in that decrease of RNA is more readily measured than decrease in protein content, allowing a more sensitive measure of viral infection.",

Both PNA and LNA probes have a stronger specificity for DNA sequence than other FISH methods, potentially allowing better signal-to-background resolution, which may allow more sensitive detection than smFISH. However, a direct comparison of these techniques for use with flow cytometry is still lacking. PNA probes that are specific for telomeres are now being applied in cancer and aging research. 75, 76 PNA probes have also been used recently for bacterial detection and environmental analysis by targeting ribosomal RNA specific to bacterial species. 65 The success in applying PNA to the fluorescence-based detection of nucleic acids suggests that PNA may be used to detect mRNA with flow cytometry. The strength of PNA is that it is relatively insensitive to ionic concentration, thus making it useful in cases in which DNA or RNA forms extensive secondary structures. Overall, PNA-DNA complexes are more stable than the corresponding DNA-DNA duplexes, but pyrimidine-rich PNA-DNA complexes, in contrast, have lower stability (whereas purine-rich PNA-DNA duplexes are in fact much more stable than DNA-DNA complexes). Because of this, the choice of sequence for PNA probes is more challenging than for traditional DNA-based probes. 65 Moreover, the physical properties of PNA differ from DNA, which makes the adoption of protocols geared toward DNA probes problematic for PNA-based probes, requiring empirical testing. 65 Another area of weakness of PNA use with flow cytometry is limited sensitivity of the technique. Therefore, detection of EBV-encoded small RNA in EBV-infected cells was shown to be inefficient when infectivity dropped below 0.2% of the population. 69 This limitation prevents harnessing a key strength of flow cytometry. Moreover, it does not compare favorably with techniques such as smFISH-Flow and RNAScope-based flow cytometric analysis, which have better resolution for detection of low-frequency cells.",

Due to electrostatic interactions, the probes used for FISH-Flow bind non-specifically within cells, which results in a normal distribution of fluorescence intensity in the population. Cells that have genuine probe binding have an increase in fluorescence that is above the level generated by background staining. For genes that have more than five to 10 copies of a transcript, fluorescence intensity is sufficient to identify each cell that is genuinely expressing the target mRNA. 13 However, for genes that only express a few transcripts, the difference between the average fluorescence intensity of the true signal to the background is very low. This is not a problem in conventional smFISH, in which imaging is performed by microscopy and each mRNA molecule is viewed as a fluorescent spot distinct from the background. However, the representation of each cell by a single fluorescence value in flow cytometry makes it impossible to determine whether low fluorescence intensity indicates the presence of target transcript(s). Autofluorescence from cells may also contribute to this background. Older technologies based on bDNA or other approaches 77 that have been used previously with microscopy-based FISH have attempted to provide a solution to this issue by increasing the fluorescence intensity of the probes themselves. However, they have not provided any genuine improvements because background increased proportionately or more. Improving the signal-to-background ratio will be necessary for using FISH-Flow to study complex genetic networks by profiling any gene in any cell type and to provide the tools for understanding the functional programs that are present in the adaptive immune response to different stages of infection.",

Instead of placing the standard laser configuration into a flow cytometer (which may have a limitation of three to four lasers) it would be advantageous to increase the number of lasers in the red, orange, and green range, selecting lasers at wavelengths that are optimal for specific fluorophores.

We have demonstrated 13 that FISH-Flow allows study of the kinetics of cytokine expression in parallel at the mRNA and protein levels.

Adaptation of FISH-Flow to live cell imaging would allow measurement of T-cell responses in memory recall assays in a temporal sequence and, more generally, the measurement of changes in gene expression in individual cells as they are exposed to new immunological contexts over time.

In a recent report, mass cytometry was used to study the signaling dynamics of cell subsets within a defined hematopoietic hierarchy in healthy human bone marrow. The research group measured 34 parameters simultaneously in single cells, including targets of 31 antibodies. This information allowed analysis of the multiple cell types in addition to their signaling responses. 86 Another group used mass cytometry to detect 22 distinct, previously unidentified human regulatory T-cell (Treg) subsets based on surface markers relating to their phenotype and function. 87 Moreover, it is now possible to perform viability testing with mass cytometry as is commonly done with flow cytometry. The platinum-containing chemotherapy drug cisplatin has been reported to distinguish live from dead cells by mass cytometry, allowing comparable distinguishing power as seen with fluorescent flow cytometry using conventional viability stains. 88 The application of this technology to the study of RNA instead of protein would allow for the profiling of immune cells at a different level. Especially if studying RNA and protein analytes is combined in parallel, then, not only novel immune cell subsets, but also their functional states, could be examined in detailed temporal scales. Alternative methodology was therefore developed here in which the platinum-containing chemotherapy drug cisplatin was used to resolve live and dead cells by mass cytometry. In a 1-min incubation step, cisplatin preferentially labeled nonviable cells from both adherent and suspension cultures, resulting in a platinum signal quantifiable by mass cytometry.",

            "text": "So far, it seems that none of the in situ hybridization techniques used with flow cytometry outperforms the others in signal-to-background resolution, multiplexing ability, or resolution of number of transcripts. Each may have some advantages over others, such as quantitative power (smFISH) or resistance to nuclease activity (PNA), but overall this does not strengthen either of these approaches enough to allow a full interrogation of genetic circuits and functional signatures in single cells from a single sample. However, newer FISH approaches may emerge that will make FISH-Flow an even more robust technology. One such technology is hybridization chain reaction (HCR). First reported by Dirks and Pierce in 2004, HCR involves multimerization of two stable hairpin nucleic acid monomers only in the presence of an initiator fragment provided by a probe hybridized to a target. 89 HCR monomers enter cells efficiently. The self-assembly chain reaction occurs with high specificity in an enzyme-and temperature-independent reaction. Using fluorescentlycoupled DNA (or RNA) hairpins produces a high signal-to-background ratio. When imaged with fluorescence microscopy, sharp fluorescent spots indicative of specific mRNA binding are observed. 90 HCR has been applied for multiplex detection of mRNA in zebrafish embryos [89] [90] [91] and bacteria and of rRNA in protozoa. 90, 93 HCR has also been used with quantum dots in vitro instead of conventional organic dyes. 92, 93 Moreover, a quantitative version of HCR (real-time HCR) has also been developed. 92, 94 In this method, one of the two DNA hairpins contains a fluorescent dye (F) and a quencher (Q) molecule. Due to the proximity between F and Q, the fluorescence of the hairpin is quenched. The HCR reaction is monitored using a thermal cycler with an optical module, but requires only a constant temperature of 25\u00b0C. Initially the starting hairpins are quenched, but, as the reaction proceeds, the fluorescence of F is eventually restored due to the increased separation between F and Q as the successive complexes hybridize into an extended chain. 89 The high signal-to-background ratio attainable with HCR, as well as its ability to be quantified, holds promise for use in FISH-Flow applications. Moreover, because HCR has such high signal amplification and specificity to target, it is possible that it may have applications to performing FISH on miRNA, further expanding the profiling capabilities of FISH-Flow.",

Therefore, a number of methods have been developed that allow illumination of mRNA in living cells. These methodologies exploit tagging of RNA with fluorescent proteins, the use of labeled oligonucleotide probes or aptamers that render organic dyes fluorescent, and molecular beacons as probes that become fluorescent upon binding to RNA. 95 For example, Larsson et al. used molecular beacons to identify live embryonic cells based on expression of marker mRNA. 96 However, the utility of these probes is currently limited by the relatively low efficacy of delivery inside cells and sensitivity of signal detection.",

When an mRNA specifically hybridizes with the capture sequence, the flare is displaced, thus restoring the fluorescence, which can then be detected and quantified. Moreover, nanoflares interact with cell membranes in such a manner that they are taken up efficiently into diverse cell types.

Moreover, by creating novel tools for basic T-cell immunology research, diagnostic and other clinical applications will also evolve. FISH-Flow has potential to be a useful tool for a number of areas under investigation now. For example, T-cell responses are necessary in order to achieve complete viral clearance. However, exhausted T-cell populations with reduced effector function can accumulate, often during chronic infections. [99] [100] [101] Exhausted T cells are not as capable of controlling infection and this functional state of T cells may be correlated with clinically determined phases characterized by failure to contain and overcome the infection. Consistent with altered function, the transcriptional programs of exhausted T cells differ significantly from that of effector or memory T-cell subsets. 99 Determining the mechanisms for transition from memory to effector and terminally differentiated (exhausted) states is an active area of research. Singlecell transcriptional profiling with FISH-Flow would be a logical choice to use in these studies because it is likely that the differences between functional states of T cells will be observed first at the level of genetic circuitry in subsets of stimulated T cells.",

Although much progress has been made in understanding the lineages and functionalities of T-cell subsets, questions still remain, such as how effector CD8 + T-cell differentiation results in the formation of cells with various phenotypes, including memory T cells, especially at the level of transcriptional programs. 46, 102 In addition, the stability of CD8 + memory T cells is known in most infections, but whether CD4 + memory T cells exhibit the same level of stability remains controversial. 103, 104 Interaction between T-cell subsets is an important aspect of fighting infection that goes beyond subset formation by differentiation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. 105 The interactions between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and their regulation have been shown to be important in malaria pathogenesis.

            "text": "FISH-Flow has the potential to address these questions, particularly by measuring mRNA expression in single cells exposed to different antigens over time. A now typical approach to studying development of T-cell memory involves genome wide microarray analysis of T-cell subsets obtained by sorting T-cell populations based on surface markers. 108 Although detailed information is obtained about the genetic contexts of cell subpopulations, the information about levels of gene up-regulation or down-regulation obtained from microarray studies remains the sum total of all the cells profiled. However, the level of mRNA expression fluctuates stochastically even in homogeneous cell populations, with cells having bursts of expression followed by a steady decay of the RNA levels, which produces a distribution of high and low mRNA production across the population. 27 ,109 Therefore, the information obtained from this approach creates an average picture of the population's behavior, which does not take into account the tendencies of individual cells. Attempts to remedy this are to complement these ensemble measurements of gene expression with measurements of protein expression in cells, which are often done with flow cytometry. Cytokine production can be compared to levels of gene expression measured with quantitative polymerase chain reaction, microarray, or next-generation sequencing. As our group has shown, 13 however, the kinetics of mRNA expression and protein expression do not always correlate. Different cytokine genes have unique patterns of expression and decay based upon immunological context. After translation, cytokine protein accumulates in the cell but is not immediately degraded. Moreover, cytokine secretion is also regulated. With FISH-Flow, mRNA measurements can be made from single cells that have their immunological context carefully controlled during ex vivo stimulation. This can be important for further studies to understand the regulation of the antigen-specific T-cell response, delineate the pathways and transcriptional programs that control the formation of heterogeneous populations of effector and memory T cells, and complement studies analyzing the gene-expression networks in the immune system, such as the Immunological Genome Project (ImmGem). In parallel to the development of diagnostic tools for infections relying on high-throughput analyses of antigen-specific T cells, significant basic research is still required to understand the control over T-cell differentiation and functional programs that are at work during response to and control of infection. FISH-Flow can be an important tool in both of these directions.",

In fact, naive, effector, and memory functional states of T cells were shown to have characteristic miRNA profiles. 114 LPS stimulation up-regulates a number of miRNAs, which target the translation of key signaling proteins. 111 In contrast, miR-143 and miR-145 are down-regulated in macrophages infected with vesicular stomatitis virus. 79 It is also known that IFN type I inhibits the transcription of the miR-145 gene, which reduces the inhibition by miR-145 of its target, HDAC11. This leads to further downstream effects because HDAC11 stops IL-10 production through its inhibition of the Il10 gene. 112 However, other research shows that miRNAs may be involved in targeting foreign nucleic acids in cells as well. For example, HIV-1 genomic RNA is a target of miR-29a in human T cells, which interacts directly with the HIV genomic DNA and inhibits HIV-1 replication. 115 In addition, other human miRNAs, such as miR-507 and miR-136, target binding sites in the polymerase B2 and hemagglutinin genes and restrict replication of influenza A virus.

            "text": "Our studies using FISH-Flow brought us to the intersection of traditional immunological paradigms and molecular genetics. Although our initial aim was to use FISH-Flow to uncover functional signatures that were based upon sequential mRNA expression of certain cytokines or other genes important in immune memory, proliferation, and up-regulation and down-regulation associated with functional changes, we observed evidence of stochasticity in these programs as well, something not generally considered in the immune context. For example, we observed that, in a stimulated population of PBMCs, the number of transcripts counted in individual cells might follow a normal distribution, but in other contexts, the distribution of mRNA transcripts in single cells showed distinct subpopulation of high and low expressers (unpublished data). Although this is hypothesized to reveal distinct functional signatures within T-cell populations, it also leads to the question of whether states of the immune system and functional signatures are the result of pre-programmed behavior, stochastic processes, or both. Molecular genetics has come to embrace a stochastic perspective on the operation of genetic circuits in single cells in a population, 27, 29, 109, 119, 120 whereas the traditional view in immunology has been that the highly coordinated processes of cellular differentiation and communication among the hundreds of cell types and subtypes within the immune system occurs through ordered, well-choreographed functional programs. Especially in the context of infection, it has become commonplace to search for and analyze defined functional programs in the hopes of better insight into infection and development of diagnostic tools. T cells have immunological memory and upon antigen presentation will go through proliferation and produce a larger immune response, including differentiation and expansion of multiple cell types. Even in the study of organismal development, stochasticity has come to play a more prominent role in explaining the course of cell fate. 121 It is possible that stochasticity is important, not just in whole-organism developmental trajectories, but also in immune cell differentiation and functional responses to infection. In that case, both stochasticity and functional programs (deterministic processes) may define the behavior of the immune system during infection. 119, 122, 123 Some processes in the adaptive immune response may result primarily from stochasticity. For other end points, stochastic processes may be only the first phase, randomly picking effector cells from a \"qualified\" pool, whereas built-in programs then take over the systemic behavior of the population during infection. It is an exciting time to explore these questions and FISH-Flow may be one of the tools used to drive investigation in this area.",
