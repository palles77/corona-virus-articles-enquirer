It is an important enzyme in the transcription/replication process involved in discontinuous negative-strand RNA synthesis. In this work, mutants of nsp15 from Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) were made based on structural analysis of the homologous nsp15s in Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). The I26A/N52A mutant of nsp15 was overexpressed, purified and crystallized, and this mutant led to a trimeric form rather than hexamers or monomers. Crystals of trimeric nsp15 were obtained by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method using polyethylene glycol as a precipitant and diffracted to 2.5 \u00c5 resolution. The crystals belonged to space group C222 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 85.9, b = 137.5, c = 423.1 \u00c5 , = = = 90 .",

Coronaviruses possess the largest genome among RNA viruses, and their replication/transcription mechanisms are poorly understood (Sawicki & Sawicki, 1995; Gorbalenya, 2001) . The genome is approximately 27 kbp in length, containing at least eight functional open reading frames (ORFs; Herold et al., 1993) .

The crystal structures of these two homologous nsp15s have been determined previously (Xu et al., 2006; Ricagno et al., 2006) , demonstrating that nsp15 is a hexamer formed by a dimer of trimers (PDB entries 2gth and 2h85). In addition, the structure of the monomeric nsp15 in SARS-CoV was determined through an N-terminal domain truncation (PDB entry 2ozk; Joseph et al., 2007) . Hexamers have been considered to be the fully active form, while monomers lose the enzymatic activity owing to a lack of RNA-binding ability (Bhardwaj et al., 2004; Joseph et al., 2007) . In previous investigations on nsp15s, even though several sitedirected mutations were made, trimers only existed in the transition state between hexamers and monomers. Stable trimeric nsp15 has not been obtained before; thus, its structure and enzymatic activity have not yet been reported (Ricagno et al., 2006; Joseph et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2006) . In this work, trimeric nsp15 from HCoV-229E was successfully obtained by mutating Ile26 and Asn52 to alanine, and the expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction studies of this trimeric nsp15 are described.",

The validity of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing (AuGCT, People's Republic ofChina). Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) cells (Novagen) carrying the recombinant plasmid were grown to an OD 600 of 0.6 in 1 l Luria-Bertani broth (LB) medium containing 100 mg l \u00c01 ampicillin, and the expression of wild-type (wt) nsp15 (or the mutants) was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 289 K overnight.

Data were processed to 2.5 \u00c5 resolution (Fig. 3) using HKL-2000 (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) . The crystals belonged to space group C222 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 85.9, b = 137.5, c = 423.1 \u00c5 , = = = 90 . Data-collection statistics for the nsp15 mutant are summarized in Table 3 .",

The mutants were I26A, I26A/N52A and L2A/E3A, which all focused on the key residues involved in the interactions between trimers. They were expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity by glutathione affinity column chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. The size-exclusion chromatography suggested that the nsp15 I26A/N52A mutant was present in a trimeric form, which eluted at approximately 13.0 ml. However, the other two mutants failed to disrupt the formation of hexamers as judged by their elution at approximately 11.8 ml, which is representative of hexamers (Fig. 4) .",

The trimeric nsp15 indicated that the interaction between Ille26 and Asn52 was crucial for the formation of the hexamer. Furthermore, the production of stable trimers is a prerequisite for further research on the structure and enzymatic activity. The trimeric nsp15 crystals diffracted to 2.5 \u00c5 resolution and belonged to space group C222 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 85.9, b = 137.5, c = 423.1 \u00c5 , = = = 90 . The crystals contained two trimers in the asymmetric unit, with a V M value of 2.60 \u00c5 3 Da \u00c01 and a solvent content of 52.75%. Structure solution was obtained by molecular replacement using Phaser (Terwilliger, 2001) ; the search template used was a trimeric nsp15 model from SARS-CoV (PDB entry 2gth). According to the initial phasing, there are two trimers, as opposed to a hexamer, packing in the asymmetric unit in a head-to-head manner. Further refinement and model building are under way. The crystallization conditions of wt nsp15 are also in the process of optimization.",
