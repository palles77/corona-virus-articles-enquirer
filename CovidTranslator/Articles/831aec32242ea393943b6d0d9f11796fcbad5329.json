In addition to allergens, respiratory viruses have been proven to be important factors in provoking asthmatic attacks. 2-4 Virus-induced damage to the respiratory epithelium results in locally intensified activity of various cells involved in the immune response. 5, 6 The presence of viruses in the respiratory tract forms a permanent source of foreign proteins, which might be the cause of subsequent pathological changes. 7 Rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus and other paramixoviruses are most frequently presumed to be the potential cause of virus-induced asthma exacerbation. [8] [9] [10] A vast number of virus and host characteristics dictate the type of infection, either persistent or latent, and determine host response and the resulting development of the disease. [11] [12] [13] Destruction of the infected cell or reorganization of viral antigens within the cell or on the cell membranes are commonly considered to be the conse-quence of virus infection. The host's immune system should finally destruct viruses. 4 In this study nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from asthmatic children whose asthma was well controlled, and when they were at least 3 weeks free of any respiratory infections. The samples were examined for the presence of adenovirus DNA and rhinovirus and coronavirus RNA.",

Johnston et al. found that upper respiratory tract viruses were associated with over 80% of asthma exacerbations in children. 3 However, our results relate to asymptomatic children, who were at least 3 weeks without any sign of respiratory infections. Nicholson and Beasley wanted to define the rate of virus participation in asthma exacerbation in adults. With the use of cell culture and serology, surprisingly low results were obtained. 4, 17 The reason seems to be that only active infections were demonstrated. Comparing virus identification rate in children with those in adult subjects demonstrates a 50% fall in isolation rate in adults. 18 Johnston maintains that the connection between upper respiratory infections and asthma exacerbation has long been recognized, but that its importance had been underestimated in most previous studies because of deficiencies in virusdetection methods used. 19 In view of the possible presence of either active or latent infection, we think that it was well advised to use PCR in our study. Another reason for the use of this method was that coronaviruses and rhinoviruses are rather difficult to grow in cultured cells. 20, 21 We have demonstrated viral DNA and RNA to be persistently present in most of asthmatic children even in the symptom-free periods. If the respiratory viruses infect only the upper respiratory tract, they affect the lower airway indirectly. 19 Gern and Fraenkel, however, confirmed that all respiratory viruses (with the exception of coronaviruses, for which no data exists) are able to infect the lower respiratory tract too. 22, 23 This raises the question as to what effects, relevant to asthma, they exhibit once they get there. Due to the high viral NAs detection rate in asthmatic children compared to the lower detection rate in the control group, we can speculate that the results could be related to the disease itself or to the glucocorticoid treatment, since there is data which suggests that glucocorticoid therapy increases the titre of respiratory viruses and prolongs viral shedding. 24, 25 ",
