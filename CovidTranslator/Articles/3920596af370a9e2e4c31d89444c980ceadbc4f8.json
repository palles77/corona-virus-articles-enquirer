However, an innate and unsolved problem regarding the ssRNA genome is formation of inactive doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) during replication. Here, we addressed this problem by focusing on the secondary structure. We systematically designed RNAs with various structures and observed dsRNA formation during replication using an RNA replicase (Q\u2424 replicase). From the results, we extracted a simple rule regarding ssRNA genome replication with less dsRNA formation (less GC number in loops) and then designed an artificial RNA that encodes a domain of the \u2424-galactosidase gene based on this rule. We also obtained evidence that this rule governs the natural genomes of all bacterial and most fungal viruses presently known. This study revealed one of the structural design principles of an ssRNA genome that replicates continuously with less dsRNA formation.",

The molecular mechanism of the replication has been intensively studied recently (7) (8) (9) . This replicase requires CCC at the 3 -teminus (10) , stem structures at the 5 -terminus (11) , an internal C/Urich domain (12) and a long-range interaction between 5and 3 -termini (13) for efficient replication. However, even if all of these requirements are satisfied, RNA-encoding genes that originate from organisms other than bacteriophage Q\u2424 mainly produce dsRNA and then terminate replication (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . Although some factors, such as components in a cell-free translation system and ribosomal protein S1, are known to inhibit dsRNA formation (22) (23) (24) , they were insufficient to render ssRNA-encoding arbitrary genes replicable without dsRNA formation (22) . In addition, rigid secondary structures of a template RNA have been reported to inhibit dsRNA formation (25, 26) . Because quantitative requirements for the structures (i.e. the size or stability of structures) have not been determined, it is not possible to design an ssRNA that encodes an arbitrary gene at this time.",

The SmaI site inside of the \u2423-domain was removed by inserting a point mutation (CCCGGG to CCCGTG). The mutant m1 sequence was synthesized chemically (Gene Design, Inc., Japan) and inserted into pUC-MDV-LR (27) as described above using the synthesized DNA as a template instead of pUC19 to obtain pUC-mdv-\u2423 mutA. The other mutants (m2- 14) were constructed by successive PCR and self-ligation processes using primers to delete or change the target sequences and pUC-mdv-\u2423 mutA as a template. The entire sequences of these RNAs are provided in the Supplemental text. These RNAs were prepared by in vitro transcription as described above.",

Based on the secondary structural predictions, we counted the average loop size and average GC number in loops.

In another study, dsRNA formation was reported to occur during replication primarily between a template RNA and the complementary newly synthesized RNA using the template RNA (28) . Based on these results, we constructed a model of dsRNA formation during replication ( Figure 1 ). In this model, as shown in the figure, (A) a template and a newly synthesized strand are extruded as ssRNAs from the replicase (34, 35) , and each strand forms intra-molecular secondary structures, (B) if both strands have loop structures at the same position, these loops are likely to associate to form a partial dsRNA (36) , (C) the partial dsRNA propagates to other regions of the strand and (D) full-length dsRNA is generated after replication is complete. A key event in the formation of dsRNA in this model is the partial formation of dsRNA shown in (B); therefore, the rate of formation and the stability of the partial dsRNA should influence the formation of the full-length dsRNA. The rate of partial dsRNA formation should depend on the sizes of the associated loops in both the template and the newly synthesized strands. The stability of the partial dsRNA should depend on the GC ratio in the loop region because hybridization strength is greater for GC pairs than AU pairs. In this study, we first attempted to verify this model by examining these predictions using RNAs with various structures and nucleotide compositions.",

The dsRNA ratio decreased by the insertion of 4-to 8-nt loops but increased by the insertion more than 8-nt loops ( Figure 3B ).

In contrast to the G and A loops, the dsRNA ratio of the RNA containing U and A loops did not increase, even with the insertion of a 20-nt loop ( Figure 3D ). To further investigate the effect of the GC ratio, we compared the dsRNA ratios of the RNAs with 10-nt loops inserted with various nucleotide compositions, such as all G (10. Loop G10), all A (11. Loop A10), all U (12. Loop U10), G and A (4. Loop GA10) and U and A (7. Loop UA10). The dsRNA ratio exhibited larger values for two RNAs (Loop G10 and GA10) that had higher GC ratios (100% and 50%, respectively, Figure 3F ).

The mismatch mutations did not affect the total RNA synthesis ( Figure 4E ) but significantly increased the dsRNA ratio when the mismatch number exceeded 4 ( Figure 4F ), indicating that the mismatch pair in stem structures should be at least less than 10% to inhibit dsRNA formation. In the experiments described above, we used RNAs that form primarily single stable structures, but generally, RNA possesses several semi-stable structures. We next investigated the effects of such multiple stable structures. We designed and inserted six sequences that form two different stable structures (one large stem or two small stems) with different ratios (23-28, transition stems 1-6). These sequences were designed to stabilize the two small stems rather than the one large stem as the number increased. The analysis of the replication products of these RNAs revealed that neither the total RNA synthesis nor the dsRNA ratios significantly differed among all of the RNAs ( Figure 5A and B), indicating that the existence of two different stable structures does not affect the dsRNA ratio.",

Based on this notion, we plotted the total GC numbers in loops of the inserted sequences against total RNA synthesis ( Figure 6A ) or the dsRNA ratio (Figure 6B ). Total RNA synthesis was almost independent, but the dsRNA ratio strongly correlated with the GC number in loops of the inserted sequences (correlation efficient is 0.81), indicating that the GC number in loops provides a useful index to predict the dsRNA ratio. According to this index, we obtained a simple rule that RNA must obey to replicate as a single strand: 'fewer (ideally <4) GC bases in loops. ' We also plotted other parameters (the sum of the loop size and the decrease of Gibbs's free energy if the inserted loop regions form a partial dsRNA) against the dsRNA ratio, but we observed weaker correlations than the GC number in loops (Supplementary Figure S1 ).",

More importantly, there is also no guarantee that we can find a sequence that both satisfies the rule and maintains the activity of the encoded gene. To examine the usefulness of this rule, we attempted to design an ssRNA that is con-tinuously replicable as a single strand and that encodes an active gene by following this rule. As a criterion of 'continuously replicable as a single strand,' we employed the condition of 'less than 0.5 dsRNA ratio,' because if the dsRNA ratio becomes >0.5, the ssRNA only decreases as replication proceeds. As a target gene, we used the \u2423-domain of \u2424galactosidase of Escherichia coli. The activity of this small gene (\u223c300 nt) is monitored by \u2423 complementation in the presence of the omega-domain of \u2424-galactosidase (31, 37) . We introduced the \u2423-domain into the same site of MDV-1 as with the RNAs in Figure 2 to obtain mdv-\u2423 RNA (original mdv-\u2423). Secondary structure prediction of this RNA revealed the existence of many large loops ( Figure 7A , original mdv-\u2423). We performed the replication experiment with this RNA and found that almost all synthesized RNA was dsRNA ( Figure 7B, original) .",

The predicted secondary structure of m1 exhibited reductions in size and the number of loops compared to the original ( Figure 7A , m1). The replication experiment with m1 indicated that the synthesis of ssRNA increased significantly, but the dsRNA ratio was still greater than 0.5 ( Figure 7B, m1) , likely because the mutant m1 still had six remaining loops that contained three or four GCs (Loops 1-6 of m1, Figure 7A ). Further reduction of the GC number by introducing synonymous mutations would be difficult in most of these loops because it would require massive reconstruction around the loop regions. Therefore, we first attempted to identify target loops that must be improved and then to reconstitute the structures around the loops. To identify the target loops, we deleted the remaining Loops 1-6 with various combinations to obtain the mutants m2-m12 and measured the dsRNA ratios of the replication products ( Table 1 ). The dsRNA ratios of these deletion mutants were all lower than that of m1. Among the deletion mutants, m3, which lost Loops 1-5, showed the lowest dsRNA ratio (0.34), and m11, which lost three loops (Loops 1, 2 and 4), lost the fewest loops, yet exhibited a dsRNA ratio of <0.5. We then attempted to modify the Loops 1, 2 and 4 regions to reduce the GC number by introducing synonymous mutations instead of deletions. For Loops 2 and 4, we reconstructed structures around the loops by introducing 10 synonymous mutations to decrease the GC number in the loops to <3. For Loop 1, which locates in the 5 -untranslated region, we simply deleted G and C in this loop to obtain mutant m13 or substituted the sequence of the loop with all U bases to obtain mutant m14. Both mutants (m13 and m14) exhibited dsRNA ratios of <0.5 (0.47 and 0.45, respectively, Figure 7B ) while maintaining the original amino acid sequence of the encoding gene.",

Taken together, these results demonstrate that based on the design rule, we succeeded in developing RNAs (m13 and m14) that possess the capacity to replicate continuously as a single strand and encode an active gene.",

We first investigated the predicted secondary structure of the ssRNA genome of bacteriophage Q\u2424, which has been reported to replicate with a low dsRNA ratio during in vitro replication (38) , and found that the GC number in loops is at the same level as that of mutant m14 and is significantly lower than that of the random sequences of the same size and GC ratio, supporting the idea that the 'less GC number in loop' rule is also valid in this genome (Supplementary Figure S2 and Table S2). To further examine the generality of the rule, we investigated all sequence data of ssRNA viral genomes that have been registered in the NCBI database and analyzed the secondary structures to count the GC numbers in the loops. A plot of the GC number against the genome size revealed that the GC numbers in loops of the ssRNA genomes of bacteria and fungi are specifically localized to a region of <1 GC in the loops ( Figure 8A ), suggesting that the ss-RNA viral genomes of these organisms obey the rule. Next, we applied the same analysis to bacterial and fungal viruses possessing other types of genomes (double-stranded RNA, single-and double-stranded DNA) ( Figure 8B ). The GC numbers in loops of other types of genomes are higher than those of ssRNA genomes, indicating that the rule of less GC number in loops is specific to ssRNA genomes. These results suggest that the rule obtained in the in vitro experiments using artificial RNAs is a general rule that governs natural viral ssRNA genomes of all bacteria and of most fungi presently known.",

            "text": "In this study, we attempted to understand design principles of an ssRNA genome that replicates without dsRNA formation. We first proposed a structure-dependent dsRNA formation model at replication (Figure 1 ) and then obtained a set of supportive evidence for the model using RNAs with various structures along with Q\u2424 replicase. From these results, we extracted a critical rule for RNA sequences (less GC number in loops) to continuously replicate as a single strand, and then we designed an ssRNA that encoded an \u2423domain of \u2424-galactosidase and was continuously replicable, mainly as a single strand. Furthermore, we also found evidence that the ssRNA genomes of all bacterial and of most fungal viruses presently known obey this rule. In summary, this study revealed one of the structural design principles of an ssRNA genome, which is useful for developing an artificial ssRNA genome and contributing to our understanding of the structural constraints governing the ssRNA genome of bacterial and fungal viruses. A plausible mechanism for the dsRNA reduction by the 'less GC number in loops' rule is that there is a decrease in partial dsRNA formation between loops on the template and the newly synthesized RNA, as shown in the model (Figure 1 ). We do not deny the possibility that the mechanism of dsRNA formation depends on the host factors of Q\u2424 replicase (EF-Tu and Ts), one of which is known to mediate dsRNA separation during replication (35) . Nevertheless, if this dsRNA formation mechanism is independent of the types of replication enzymes, this rule might be applicable to other RNA replications catalyzed by different replication enzymes, including ribozymes. The formation of dsRNA is considered to be a serious problem in RNA replication by ribozymes in the hypothetical RNA world (3) and in in vitro RNA replication systems (39) . The results obtained in this study suggest that the dsRNA problem of primitive genomic RNAs can be solved by reducing the GC number in loops.",

Therefore, the nascent strand can be synthesized as a single strand, even if it possesses a high GC content in loop. Another possibility is that RNA-binding proteins might bind and inhibit the hybridization between a template and a newly synthesized strand. SsRNA viruses of vertebrates include clinically important viruses, such as coronaviruses and hepatitis C virus. Although further investigations are required, the discovery of the mechanisms that inhibit dsRNA formation in vertebrates might provide a new drug target for ssRNA virus infection.",

The original mdv-\u2423 RNA was constructed by inserting the \u2423-domain gene of \u2424-galactosidase into MDV-1 RNA. First, we introduced 75 synonymous mutations to reduce the GC number in loops to less than 5 and to obtain mutant m1. Second, after selecting target loops to be improved, we further introduced several synonymous mutations and deletions to obtain mutants m13 and m14 (the structure of m14 is almost the same as that of m13). (B) Replication of the mdv-\u2423 mutants. Some mdv-\u2423 mutants (100 nM) were incubated with Q\u2424 replicase (100 nM) in the presence of [ 32 P]-UTP for 20 min at 37 \u2022 C, and the replicated ssRNA and dsRNA were detected by autoradiography after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described in 'Materials and Methods' section. The dsRNA ratios are shown at the bottom. (C) Time-course data of replication. Replication was performed with each RNA (1 nM) and Q\u2424 replicase (100 nM) as described in 'Materials and Methods' section, and the total synthesized RNA amounts (the sum of ssRNA and dsRNA) were measured. (D) \u2423-Complementation activities. Each RNA was mixed with the reconstituted translation system in the presence of the omega protein of \u2424-galactosidase and fluorescence substrate, as described in 'Materials and Methods' section. The fluorescence was measured every minute.",
