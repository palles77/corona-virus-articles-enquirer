Epidemic models have previously treated this as a demographic phenomenon where each individual has an infectivity allocated at random from some distribution. Here, it is shown that superspreading can also be regarded as being caused by environmental variability, where superspreading events (SSEs) occur as a stochastic consequence of the complex network of interactions made by individuals. This interpretation based on SSEs is compared with data and its efficacy in evaluating epidemic control strategies is discussed.",

Progress has been made by modelling superspreading as a demographic phenomenon, allowing variation in infectivity between individuals. This may be interpreted as variation in quantities such as pathogen shedding rate (Matthews et al. 2006) or total lifetime infectiousness (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005) . Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) combine contact tracing data with a stochastic model based on individual variability to implicate superspreading in human diseases including SARS, Ebola haemorrhagic fever (HF), measles and smallpox. Their results indicate that the traditional metric R 0 (the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a fully susceptible population) is an inadequate indicator of whether or not an epidemic will be triggered; repeated field observations of low R 0 may lead to serious underestimation of epidemic potential.",

In a branching process, each infected individual infects a random number of susceptibles in each time-step (generation) and the epidemic spreads generation-by-generation. Individuals infect independently, following some probabilistic offspring distribution (defined as the number of secondary cases Z caused by an infectious individual). Successful monitoring, prevention and control of epidemics therefore depend on understanding this offspring distribution. The simplest branching process model (BP1) ignores variation between individuals; each individual infects as a Poisson process, ZwPoisson(R 0 ). A slightly more sophisticated model (BP2) allows some heterogeneity among the individuals by introducing a random variable n, the expected number of infections caused by an infected individual. BP2 assumes that n is exponentially distributed with mean R 0 , so that ZwGeometric(R 0 ). Mechanistically, this model can be interpreted as individuals being infectious for an exponentially distributed time, t I , motivated by a constant SIR removal rate. The model in Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) , herein labelled as LS, generalizes this notion by allowing n to be gamma distributed, yielding a negative binomial distribution for Z which is argued to more effectively describe epidemics where SS is a key feature.",

The data in table 1 indicate two distinct classes of epidemic. Parameters fitted to the SARS epidemics and the UK foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemics indicate that SS is a vital ingredient. The proportion of infections occurring as a result of SSEs, a, is relatively large and the average number of secondary infections occurring as a result of a single SSE, l, is also large (between 11 and 22).

An analysis of the outbreak data for the diseases in table 1 in the framework of the 20/80 rule is revealing. Figure 1 shows the cumulative percentage of infections caused (i.e. the contribution to R 0 ) by the most infectious individuals. For the diseases identified in table 1 as having a major SS component (SARS and FMD), the most infectious 20% of individuals caused more than 80% of all infections. In fact, in all these epidemics, 80% of all infections were attributable to the most infectious 2-10% of individuals. For the other disease outbreaks, the most infectious 20% of individuals caused less than 80% of all infections (approx. 70% for measles and 60% for Ebola HF, hantavirus and plague).",

This indicates an opportunity to develop targeted control policies based on reducing the frequency ( r) or severity (l) of SSEs. In terms of human epidemics, a reduction in SSE frequency r corresponds to reducing the frequency of large gatherings of people, for example, by temporarily reducing the working/school week from 6 to 3 days. A reduction in SSE severity l could similarly be achieved by reducing the maximum number of people gathering together, for example, by segregating the work force and/ or the physical environment and staggering break times, or encouraging local small-scale meetings rather than large assemblies. However, SSEs are by no means confined to the school and workplace (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005) ; so halving the working week, for example, would not correspond to the halving of r. While it is unrealistic to imagine all potential for SSEs being eradicated, or all non-SS infections being entirely prevented, the CP framework allows the effect of such imperfect measures to be estimated. The FMD data analysed here use properties (farms) as the unit of infection rather than individual animals (Keeling et al. 2001) . Therefore, a SSE might be precipitated by gatherings of animals from large numbers of properties such as markets, and one could similarly evaluate the efficacy of reducing the frequency (proportional to r) and size (proportional to l) of markets. If SS is known to be significant and economics demand that a constant number of animals be processed per unit time, so that rl remains constant, reference to equation (2.2) and figure 2b shows that holding more markets of a smaller size will diminish the impact of SS compared with the alternative of holding fewer larger markets. (Note, however, that large markets are also argued to offer logical foci for targeted interventions, where such interventions exist ).",

The generality of this definition is a strength in that it allows flexibility, particularly where the underlying mechanism of the infection process is unclear.

The reason for this difference is that the LS model is based on a heavy-tailed distribution, which becomes highly overdispersed for high levels of SS. The extinction probabilities for the CP model also tend to 1 as the severity of the SSEs (l) becomes very large (figure 2b), but this is due to a 'top-heavy' distribution rather than to a heavytailed one. Another difference is that the CP model has the potential for a bimodal offspring (infection) distribution: there is a Poisson-like distribution at the lefthand end and a possible second mode dominated by SSEs. This contrasts with the heavy-tailed unimodal distribution of LS. Figure 4 shows two SARS offspring distributions, showing the original data together with the best fit of the CP and LS models.

            "text": "Despite approaching the problem of SS from different directions, the CP and LS models show a good deal of agreement about its epidemiological consequences. Both predict that increasing the degree of SS increases the probability that any given outbreak will go extinct and, conversely, that any outbreak which is successful (from the point of view of the disease) will potentially be much more severe than would naively be anticipated from the value of R 0 . The two models characterize SS in different ways, thus lending themselves to different epidemiological scenarios and different approaches to control. Indeed, the modelling of superspreading as events driven by a stochastic environment and as heterogeneities between the individuals both represent idealized infection dynamics. Reality lies somewhere in between, where heterogeneous individuals infect according to stochastic events driven by a random environment of social (or other) interactions. The CP model efficiently describes epidemics driven largely by rare events drawn from similar underlying distributions, whereas the LS model is more appropriate for populations with an overdispersed distribution of individual infectiousness. An attempt to marry these two approaches by modelling both individual heterogeneity and rare SSEs is an important challenge for the future. The branching process model analysed here is a simple representation of a complex phenomenon, but nevertheless its message is important for more realistic simulation models. The choice of a deterministic infectious period imposes a natural generational time-step on any resulting branching process, but this need not be restrictive. Infectious individuals need not 'die' after each time-step, but could simply be included as an offspring in the next generation with a certain probability, resulting in a discrete version of the BP2 exponential infective period model. Such possibilities are not considered here, partly because one must then address the issue of implausibly long infectious periods. Since SS offspring distributions can arise without indefinitely long infectious periods, it seems unnecessary to introduce them. However, the roles of a finite population of susceptibles, and any explicit spatial structure, require further (possibly disease-specific) modelling outside the scope of this communication. ",
