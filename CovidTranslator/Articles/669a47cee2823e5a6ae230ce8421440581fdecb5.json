This bias is presumably because viral investigations are often driven by disease outbreaks in the above populations. By contrast, investigations of wildlife are rare (20, 24) , and relatively little is known about the prevalence of coronavirus in wild animal species (3) . The identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in civet cats and other wild animals in live animal markets suggests that this novel human pathogen emerged as a result of an interspecies transmission (8) . More importantly, these findings highlight the potential human health risk posed by coronaviruses in wild animals. This has prompted us to launch a survey of the prevalence of coronavirus in wild animals in Hong Kong. In particular, we were interested in determining whether wild animals living in this geographical region carry the precursor of SARS-CoV or other unidentified coronaviruses. Here, we report the identification of a novel bat coronavirus (BAT-CoV).",

Before samples were taken, all animals were examined by a veterinary surgeon and confirmed to be free of overt disease. All captured animals were released after samples were taken.

Briefly, 10 l of eluted RNA samples was reverse transcribed by 200 U of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 20-l reaction mixture containing 0.15 g of random hexamers, 10 mmol of dithiothreitol per liter, and 0.5 mmol of deoxynucleoside triphosphate per liter. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 42\u00b0C for 50 min, followed by a heat inactivation step (72\u00b0C for 15 min). Reversetranscribed products were stored at \u03ea20\u00b0C. PCR and sequencing. A pair of consensus primers targeted to the conserved region of coronavirus RNA polymerase (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp]) sequences was used to screen the RNA samples (PCR 2 in Table 2 ). In a typical PCR, 2 l of cDNA was amplified in a 50-l reaction mixture containing 0.2 mmol of deoxynucleoside triphosphates per liter, 3 mmol of MgCl 2 per liter, 0.5 mol of forward primer per liter, 0.5 mol of reverse primer per liter, and 0.25 U of AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems). PCR was performed as follows: In subsequent experiments, primers targeted to the RdRp, helicase-ExoN, and S-encoding sequences were used to determine the Bat-CoV sequence ( Table 2 , PCRs 1 and 3 to 6). PCR conditions of these assays were identical to the PCR assay described above. DNA products with expected sizes were purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) and were cloned into DNA vectors (pCR-TOPO; Invitrogen). DNA inserts in purified plasmid were sequenced by BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing products were analyzed by ABI PRISM 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Both sense and antisense sequences of these PCR products were sequenced at least once.",

On the basis of the conserved regions of group 1 viruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, PEDV, TGEV, FIPV, and CCoV), 30 sets of primers were generated for the determination of the viral sequences. Of these PCRs, five additional viral RNA sequences were deduced ( Table 2 , PCRs 1 and 3 to 6). Alignments of these deduced sequences generated three RNA fragments containing partial sequences for the (i) RdRp gene, (ii) genes C terminal of the helicase gene and N terminal of the hypothetical exonuclease (ExoN) gene, and (iii) S genes ( Table 3 ). The percent sequence identity of each RNA fragment to group 1 to 3 viruses was determined ( Table 4 ). All these RNA sequences shared the highest identity with group 1 coronaviruses (54 to 75%). Phylogenetic analyses of these viral sequences resulted in consensus trees with similar topologies (Fig. 1B, Fig. 3A , and Fig. 4A ). In all cases, Bat-CoV clustered with group 1 coronaviruses.

Motif C contains the highly conserved SDD sequence and is associated with metal ion and 3\u0408-primer terminus binding. Motif F contains several conserved positively charged basic residues and is associated with nucleoside triphosphate binding. This motif could be divided into three submotifs (F1 to F3) (25) . Like other coronaviruses, the F motif of Bat-CoV lacks the F2 submotif. The biological functions of the F2 submotif in other viruses are yet to be determined. The G motif had a conserved SXGXP sequence and is known to be involved in positioning of the 5\u0408 template strand in other RdRps. The RNA fragment for the helicase-ExoN junction encodes the last 54 amino acid residues of the RNA helicase and the first 143 amino acid residues of the putative exonuclease (Fig.  4B ) (21) . The partial sequence for the helicase protein contains the conserved helicase motifs V and VI (12) . The partial sequence for the putative ExoN protein contains motif 1 of the DEDD exonuclease superfamily (21) .

These results demonstrate that this virus has a narrow host range. As the viral sequences in Miniopterus spp. are highly similar, our data imply that there are frequent interspecies transmissions between these species. It is not certain which Miniopterus species is the natural host of the virus. However, the majority of M. pusillus bats were found to be infected by this virus. In addition, the detection rates of this virus in M. pusillus in the summer of 2003 and 2004 were similar (57% in 2003 and 67% in 2004). These observations suggest that M. pusillus is likely to be the major reservoir of this virus. As the majority of M. pusillus bats in Hong Kong are known to migrate to tropical areas to overwinter (K. Y. Suen, personal communication), we do not know the prevalence of Bat-CoV in this species in winter.

These findings are further supported by the fact that the S protein of Bat-CoV contains the unique signature of group 1 coronaviruses (i.e., the unique 14 amino acids in HR1 and HR2) (2). Recombination is common in coronaviruses and is thought to contribute to the emergence of new coronaviruses (9). Our limited sequencing results do not allow us to draw any conclusions of the origin of this virus. However, the low sequence homology between Bat-CoV sequences and other coronavirus sequences at least suggest that this novel virus is not a recent recombinant from existing coronaviruses.

Second, due to the limited sample sizes of each animal species, we might miss the viruses which are circulating in low frequency. Besides, the conserved primers used in this study were based on available coronavirus sequences, and these primers might not be able to detect coronaviruses that are genetically more divergent from previously known coronaviruses. We previously reported that SARS-CoV could be isolated from Himalayan palm civets (8) . It should be noted that the SARS-CoV-positive animals in our previous study were obtained from wild animal markets and not captured in the wild. None of the civets examined in our current study (n \u03ed 21) was positive for SARS-CoV by both serological and molecular tests. The results from our present study do not exclude the possibility that the civet is the natural host of SARS-CoV, but our results at least indicate that SARS-CoV is not broadly circulating in wild civets.
