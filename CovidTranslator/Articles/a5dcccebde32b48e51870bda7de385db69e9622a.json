While most of the microbial threat agents of potential use in bioterrorism occur naturally in various ecological niches throughout the world, they are rare and sporadic causes of human disease in developed countries and urban environments. It is human behavior within the context of the extant geopolitical milieu that transforms these naturally-occurring organisms into potential weapons of mass terror.",

Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq developed and deployed anthrax-and botulinum-laden warheads in the years leading up to the Gulf War (Zilinskas, 1997) ; the reasons that these weapons were never used in an actual attack probably had more to do with the implicit threat of overwhelming US retaliation and Iraqi technological defi ciencies rather than the regime's reluctance to violate any moral principles. Biological agents have also been used to forward political ideologies: in 1984 a religious cult, intent on infl uencing voter turnout during a local election, contaminated restaurant salad bars in The Dalles, Oregon, with Salmonella, resulting in over 750 cases of gastroenteritis among patrons, employees, and their contacts (Torok et al., 1997) . This event, coupled with revelations that the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo had attempted, multiple times, to release weaponized anthrax before their successful release of sarin nerve agent in the Tokyo subway system in 1995 (Olson, 1999) , provides compelling evidence of the terrorist potential of these agents.",

When applied to cause-specifi c mortality, risk can be viewed in a purely statistical sense: the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease in the US in the year 2000 was approximately 1 in 400, while the risk of succumbing in a lightning strike was approximately 1 in 4.5 million (Table 12 .1). In the arenas of human biology and medicine, however, risk assessment is based on the complex interplay of genetics, environmental factors, and chance. Risk as it relates to bioterrorism is diffi cult to quantify; while the probability of exposure to a biologic attack is statistically low, it is not zero, and the consequences are potentially catastrophic. This, coupled with the fact that the likelihood of actual hazard exposure is dependent on the whims of terrorists (and therefore an unpredictable variable), renders accurate risk assessment impossible.",

As a response he formed the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood in 1928, dedicated to re-establishing an Islamic state in which the tenets of the religion and the precepts of Islamic shariah (holy law) were both fi rmly established (Moussalli, 1998) . As the movement evolved, the scope broadened to the establishment of a fundamentalist Islamic world-view (Davidson, 1998) . In this way, a movement that began as predominantly Arab and anti-colonial has now become pan-Islamic, drawing from the entire, diverse, global Muslim population, in excess of 1 billion people.

Actions sanctioned by the leader are thereby endowed with sacred signifi cance, thus explaining the fervor with which group members kill innocent non-believers. Because their motivation is to expel Western secular values and create a pure Islamic state, they believe their actions are sanctioned by the Koran and not constrained by Western morals; they are willing to do the \"unthinkable,\" including the use of biological agents as weapons (Post et al., 2003) . Their enemies are anyone who is opposed to their worldview. While the primary goal is to attack symbolic targets that refl ect the secular decadence of Western life and attract media attention, many attacks are conducted against smaller secondary targets, due to greater accessibility. A novel aspect of these terrorist's tactics is the focus on killing as many innocent people as possible. As illustrated by the 1998 US embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya, an additional objective appears to be the infl uencing of geopolitics through the induction of widespread fear in communities throughout the world where Western interests are present (Borum and Gelles, 2005) .",

This is in contradistinction to other forms of WMD, where recognition of an actual \"event\" occurs with the deployment, allowing mitigation strategies to begin nearly immediately.

Thus, state sponsorship or the support of organizations with signifi cant resources and infrastructure would likely be necessary for the execution of substantial or multifocal attacks. However, recent revelations suggest the availability of bioweapons on the global black market (Miller et al., 2001) , and their relative simplicity, availability, and portability may make them preferable to expensive conventional or nuclear weapons for small, well-resourced terrorist organizations or even isolated terrorist cells.

The latter refers to the consistency with which a biological agent causes high mortality, morbidity, and social disruption, and its intrinsic transmission characteristics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have prioritized biologic agent threats based on the aforementioned characteristics (CDC, 2000) ; the major purpose of this classifi cation is to direct and focus public health preparedness strategies (Table 12. 3). Category A agents, considered the highest priority, are those associated with high mortality and the greatest potential for major impact on the public health. Additionally, category A agents have been demonstrated to be capable of wide dissemination or personto-person transmission. Category B agents are moderately high priority concerns. They may be considered \"incapacitating\" agents because of their potential for moderately high morbidity, but relatively low mortality. Most of the category A and B agents were experimentally weaponized and tested by the former Soviet Union, and are thus of proven feasibility (Alibek, 1999) . Category C agents include emerging threats and pathogens that may be available for development into bioweapons in the future. As previously discussed, the potential exploitation of scientifi c progress by terrorists should prompt innovative thinking as it pertains to risk assessment and public health response. It is critical to be cognizant of future novel threats based upon engineered emergent or re-emergent pathogens (Madsen and Darling, 2006) . Towards this end, the current authors have added a miscellaneous grouping of potential threat agents to the extant CDC categories (Table 12. 3).",

As discussed above, it is likely that the circumstances of any event will only be known in retrospect; therefore it may prove problematic immediately to discern the extent of exposure. Terrorists have an unlimited number of targets in most open, democratic , 2002) . Metropolitan areas are considered vulnerable, but, owing to the expansion of suburbs, commuters, and the clinical latency period between exposure and symptoms inherent with biologic agents, casualties of bioterrorism are likely to present for medical attention in diverse locations and at varying times after common exposures. A covert bioterrorism attack in New York City on a Wednesday morning may result in clinically ill persons presenting for medical attention over the ensuing weekend to a variety of emergency departments, urgent care centers, and physician offi ces within a 60-mile (\u03f3100-km) commuter radius. Additional cases may be seen hundreds or thousands of miles away at both national and international locations as infected, mobile individuals make use of modern modes of transportation during the clinical incubation period. This adds layers of complexity to an already complicated setting, and illustrates the critical importance of surveillance and real-time communication in this setting. Further hindering the early recognition of bioterrorism is that the initial symptoms of many of the high priority agents may be non-diagnostic. In the absence of a known exposure, many symptomatic persons may either not seek medical attention early, or if they do they may be misdiagnosed as having a fl u-like or other benign illness. Once beyond the early stages many illnesses related to bioterrorism progress rapidly, and treatment may be less successful. Because most of the diseases caused by agents of bioterrorism are rarely (if ever) seen in clinical practice, physicians are likely to be inexperienced with their clinical characteristics; physicians were only able to correctly diagnose diseases due to category A agents 47 percent of the time in one multicenter study (Cosgrove et al., 2005) . Additionally, these agents will by defi nition have been manipulated in a laboratory, and those affected may not present with the classic clinical features seen in naturally occurring infection. This was dramatically illustrated by some of the inhalational anthrax cases in the United States (Jernigan et al., 2001) .",

The recognition of a single case of a rare or non-endemic infection, in the absence of an appropriate travel history or other potential natural exposure, should raise the suspicion of bioterrorism and should prompt notifi cation of public health authorities. Finally, unusual patterns of disease, such as an acute, fulminant febrile illness in an otherwise healthy young individual, or concurrent illness in human and animal populations, should raise suspicions of bioterrorism or another novel, emerging infection.

In nature, anthrax is a zoonotic disease of herbivores that is ubiquitous in the soil of many geographic regions; sporadic human disease results from environmental or occupational contact with endospore-contaminated animal products (Dixon et al., 1999) . The cutaneous form of anthrax is the most common presentation of naturally-occurring disease; gastrointestinal and inhalational forms are exceedingly rare. Cutaneous anthrax occurred regularly in the fi rst half of the twentieth century in association with contaminated hides and wools used in the garment industry, but it is uncommonly seen in current-day industrialized countries due to importation restrictions. The last known case of naturally occurring inhalational anthrax in the US occurred in 1976 (Suffi n et al., 1978) .",

What was once an occupational disease of slaughterhouse workers, ranchers, and mill workers has now become an occupational hazard of politicians, journalists, postal workers, and the public at large (Witkowski and Parish, 2002) . Prevailing wisdom had previously held that a largescale bioterrorism attack with anthrax would employ aerosolized endospores and result in outbreaks of inhalational disease. The attacks in the US in 2001 illustrate the diffi culties in predicting modes and outcomes in bioterrorism: the attacks were on a relatively small scale, and while endospores were used, the delivery methodenvelopes -resulted in a signifi cant proportion of cutaneous cases . However, as with the Sverdlovsk outbreak in 1979, the serious morbidity and mortality in the US attacks were related to inhalational disease. Thus, it still seems warranted to plan for larger-scale events with aerosolized agents.",

Unless secondarily infected, anthrax is traditionally a painless lesion and associated with signifi cant local edema. The bite of Loxosceles reclusa, the brown recluse spider, shares many of the local and systemic features of anthrax, but is typically painful from the outset and lacks such signifi cant edema (Freedman et al., 2002) .

Spores may remain latent for extended periods of time in the host, up to 100 days in experimental animal exposures (Henderson et al., 1956) . This correlates with the potential for prolonged clinical incubation periods after exposure to endospores; cases of inhalational anthrax occurred up to 43 days after exposure in the Sverdlovsk experience (Meselson et al., 1994) . The calculated incubation period based on the known dates of exposure in 6 of the 11 cases of inhalational anthrax from 2001 ranged from 4 to 6 days (Jernigan et al., 2001) , and from 1 to 10 days for the cutaneous cases (Bell et al., 2002) .

Mailed letters containing anthrax spores in late September and early October of 2001 from a still-unidentifi ed terrorist source(s) resulted in 22 cases of bioterrorism-associated anthrax (Lucey, 2005) .

Because variola virus does not exist in nature, and legitimate stocks were confi ned to the two sites in the US and Russia, the occurrence of even a single case of smallpox outside of an accidental laboratory exposure would be tantamount to bioterrorism.

Primary pneumonic plague classically presents as an acute, febrile, pneumonic illness with prominent respiratory and systemic symptoms; gastrointestinal symptoms, purulent sputum production or hemo ptysis occur variably (Artenstein and Lucey, 2000) . Chest roentgenogram typically shows patchy, bilateral, multilobar infi ltrates or consolidations. In the absence of appropriate treatment, there may be rapid progression to respiratory failure, vascular collapse, purpuric skin lesions, necrotic digits, and death. The differential diagnosis, as noted in Table 12 .5, is largely that of rapidly progressive pneumonia. The diagnosis may be suggested by the characteristic small Gram-negative coccobacillary forms in stained sputum specimens with bipolar uptake -the \"safety pin\" appearance -of Giemsa or Wright stain (Inglesby et al., 2000) .

For this reason, early diagnoses of the fi rst cases are likely to prove problematic; heightened clinical vigilance is required to recognize presentations of diseases that are rarely seen in clinical practice (Artenstein, 2003) .

Treatment and prevention issues -such as the absence of effective treatments for many forms of viral hemorrhagic fevers, shortages in the availability of multivalent anti-toxin for botulism, projected shortages in the availability of mechanical ventilators to manage a large-scale attack using botulism, lack of human data regarding the use of antiviral agents in smallpox, and the unfavorable toxicity profi les of currently available smallpox vaccinesremain unresolved but active areas of research. The fact that modern molecular biologic techniques have been used to produce genetically altered pathogens with \"designer\" phenotypes, such as antimicrobial or vaccine resistance, adds additional layers of complexity to an already complex problem.

However, LVS vaccine licensure was recently revoked due to several problems: it affords incomplete protection against laboratory-acquired tularemia (Eigelsbach and Down, 1961; Saslaw, et al., 1961; Burke, 1977) ; the genetic and immunological basis for its attenuation and immunogenicity remains unknown (Oyston et al., 2004) ; and it provides suboptimal protection against aerosol challenge in animal and human studies Hornick and Eigelsbach, 1966) . To date, an incomplete understanding of correlates of protection in tularemia has hindered development of an effective subunit vaccine. Completion of the genetic sequence for the infective strain F. tularensis SCHU S4 and the vaccine strain LVS may further the discovery of proteins which are likely to induce protective immunity (Larsson et al., 2005; Oyston and Quarry, 2005; Twine et al., 2005) .",

Botulinum toxin is expressed by C. botulinum in seven structural forms designated toxins A-G (Arnon et al., 2001) . There is currently a pseudo-licensed US vaccine against serotypes A-E, developed in the early 1970s (Byrne and Smith, 2000) . It consists of formalin-deactivated purifi ed toxins (toxoids) combined to form a pentavalent vaccine. An individual monovalent vaccine against serotype F has been developed in the United Kingdom (Hatheway, 1976) . For purposes of mass production, DNA-based vaccines are under development. The carboxyl half of botulinum toxin appears to be the best vaccine candidate, and several vaccine expression systems in yeast and viral vectors are currently being tested in animal models (Lee et al., 2005; Middlebrook, 2005) .",

A general approach to the management of biothreat infections requires an assessment of the risk of certain drugs or products in select populations versus the potential risk of the infection in question, accounting for extent of exposure and the agent involved. While specifi c recommendations for treatment and prophylaxis have been recently reviewed (Inglesby et al., , 2000 Dennis et al., 2001) , these only address the biological part of the issue. A larger and more complex problem is ensuring that risk communication regarding bioterrorism and other emergencies is appropriately formulated and delivered in a fashion that is accessible and understandable by at-risk populations in our communities, and that these people have access to the public health system in a manner that optimizes health and minimizes the transmission of contagion (McGough et al., 2005) .",

Nearly half of the emergency department visits during the Gulf War missile attacks on Israel in 1991 were related to acute psychological illness or exacerbations of underlying psychopathology (Karsenty et al., 1991) . Data from recent acts of terrorism in the US suggest that PTSD may develop in as many as 35 percent of those affected by the events (Yehuda, 2002) . In the early period after the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York, PTSD and depression were nearly twice as prevalent as in historical control subjects (Galea et al., 2002) . Although close proximity to the events and personal loss were directly correlated with PTSD and depression, respectively, there was a substantial burden of morbidity among those only indirectly involved. The psychological impact of these events and of persistent international concern over terrorism can be expected to be signifi cant and sustained for society as a whole.",

Although these attacks were small scale and employed a low-technology approach to anthrax delivery, their impact was substantial: two branches of the Federal Government were temporarily closed, postal operations were severely disrupted, thousands of potentially exposed persons received post-exposure prophylaxis, total mitigation costs approached US$3 billion, and scarce public health resources were diverted away from other concerns to manage the inordinate volume of false alarms that accompanied the actual exposures (Heyman, 2002) .

This uncertainty, along with a rapidly evolving situation on the ground and heightened public anxieties (no doubt magnifi ed in the immediate post-9/11 period), led to inconsistent statements and actions by public health authorities, which exacerbated the public's lack of confi dence in its leaders. One such example was the recommended use of ciprofl oxacin as post-exposure prophylaxis for the Senate Offi ce workers, while the mostly African-American postal workers were given doxycycline. As both drugs are effective, a consistent message and recommendation would have gone a long way towards assuaging public concern. The overarching theme highlighted by the anthrax attacks of 2001 is that our public health response planning must be proactive, not reactive to future events.",

Historically, 1 per million vaccinees developed a fatal complication (Lane et al., 1970) . The vaccination program was designed to screen participants carefully in order to minimize the potential for serious sequelae (CDC, 2003) ; in general it was successful in this regard, with over 730,000 military personnel and 40,000 civilian volunteers vaccinated, and very low rates of predictable, serious adverse events noted (Grabenstein and Winkenwerder, 2003; Poland et al., 2005) .",

Ischemic cardiac events occurred in 24 military and 9 civilian vaccinees; in retrospect, most had underlying coronary artery disease, and the incidence of ischemia did not exceed the level expected in an age-matched, unvaccinated population (Poland et al., 2005) . On the other hand, 86 cases of myopericarditis in military vaccinees and 22 cases among civilians were recognized, leading an expert panel to conclude that smallpox vaccination is casually related to myopericarditis and increases the risk of this complication (Poland et al., 2005) . Thus, data gleaned from preparations for a potential bioterrorist attack using smallpox will inform future vaccine efforts for smallpox as well as other areas of biodefense.",

H5N1 has met two of three criteria for a pandemic: it represents a novel subtype of infl uenza to which the population is immunologically na\u00efve, and it is capable of infecting humans (albeit in limited fashion to date) and causing potentially lethal disease (WHO, 2005) .

While the overall risk of bioterrorism is probably low from a practical standpoint, the consequences are potentially quite high; thus it is essential that we continue to develop countermeasures and response plans.
