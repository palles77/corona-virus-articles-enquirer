Syphilis was the first transmissible disease for which prospective blood donor testing was implemented in the 1950s [1] . Although infectious post-transfusion hepatitis (PTH) was recognized and described in the early 1940s [2] , it was believed to be a transient and generally minor infectious complication, and interventions to reduce PTH did not occur until the discovery of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus decades later. Awareness of infectious disease transmission by transfusion did not slow the dramatic increase in administration of donated blood from the 1950s through 1970s, which paralleled the expansion of medical care and procedural capability during that period.",

            "text": "Given the widespread use of transfusions by the early 1980s, the realization that the then newly-discovered fatal acquired immunodeficiency syndrome could be transmitted by transfusion came as a shock to transfusion medicine specialists and the public. Since then, efforts to protect the blood supply from the viruses causing AIDS (HIV) and PTH have resulted in an unparalleled focus of resources and attention on the characterization, detection, and prevention of TTIDs. This commitment has paid off, and blood safety is now at historically unprecedented levels, at least in high-income countries (Table 1) [3, 4] . However, public uneasiness and concerns among health professionals about disease transmission by transfusion persist, and these concerns have caused a redirection of attention from the classical TTIDs to ''emerging infections.'' For the purposes of this review, the authors apply this term broadly to include (1) recently discovered entities, such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), for which transmission by transfusion is unproved; (2) longer-known pathogens, such as West Nile virus, that are newly recognized as agents causing TTIDs, and (3) conditions such as bacterial contamination and malaria that have been a concern since the beginning of transfusion therapy but are emerging as more pressing concerns now that classical TTIDs have been nearly eliminated. The authors follow a taxonomic order in reviewing the various pathogens. The article closes with a brief reflection on the challenges posed by new and emerging pathogens and an outline of the general approaches that are pursued to protect the blood supply. Abbreviations: HBV, hepatitis B virus; HCV, hepatitis C virus; NAT, nucleic acid testing. a Estimates for HBV reflect risk projections prior to implementation of blood donor screening with NAT [3] . b Estimates for HIV, HCV indicate risk projections following implementation of NAT for these agents in 1999 [3] . c Risk estimate reflects the experience of a 2-year United States national study from 1998-2000, prior to implementation of standards to detect and limit bacterial contamination. Because of likely underreporting, true risks were probably higher [58] .",

            "text": "These viruses, which are primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route, cause frequent epidemics of acute hepatitis in developing countries, with occasional focal outbreaks in the United States and other developed countries. Viremic periods are generally brief, although, at least in the case of hepatitis A virus (HAV), viremia may be present up to 30 days before onset of symptoms, which is longer than previously realized [7] . Because prolonged carrier states have not been described and parenteral transmission is rare, neither HAV nor hepatitis E virus (HEV) is considered a blood-borne pathogen in the strict sense. Animal inoculation studies and one recent report in humans have documented transmission of HEV by transfusion of fresh components, although the risk is undoubtedly very small given the rarity of reports and the high prevalence of this infection in many developing countries [7] [8] [9] . On the other hand, cases of transfusiontransmitted HAV have been well documented and are estimated to occur at a rate of less than approximately 1 per million units transfused [6, 10, 11] . A greater concern is contamination of plasma derivatives, such as albumin, gamma globulin preparations, and clotting factor concentrates, by HAV. Because of the pooling of thousands of plasma donations in the manufacture of plasma derivatives and the relative resistance of HAV to inactivation, even rare instances of donor viremia can lead to widespread contamination of these products. Consequently, HAV has caused several outbreaks of clinical disease from contaminated coagulation factor preparations [12, 13] . Albumin, plasma protein fractions, and immune globulin preparations, however, have not been implicated in HAV transmission. The manufacturing process for these products partitions virus into different plasma fractions, and the presence of anti-HAV in immune globulin preparations can be expected to protect against residual infectious HAV, should it enter this product [14] . Newer viral inactivation methods and nucleic acid testing (NAT) on pooled plasma samples promise further protection from HAV transmission by means of plasma products. Because of the remote risk of HAV transmission from transfusion, screening of blood donors using NAT technology has not been recommended.",

Hepatitis G virus (GBV-C), a member of the Flaviviridae family, is transmitted predominantly by the parenteral route. Infection occurs frequently among those infected with HCV and HIV. Approximately 2% of blood donors and 15% to 20% of injection-drug users in the United States have detectable GBV-C RNA. Additional persons have antibodies against E2 envelopes protein in the absence of GBV-C RNA, suggesting viral clearance.

Owing to a series of incrementally effective preventive measures, the risk of HIV-transfusiontransmitted infection has declined remarkably in high-income countries and can now only be estimated through mathematical modeling [4, 20] . The most recent estimate projects a residual risk of approximately 1 in 1.9 million transfusions [3] . Blood donor screening with currently available antibody and nucleic acid assays is highly sensitive and reliable. Unfortunately, lowincome nations, many of which are burdened with appallingly high prevalence of HIV, lack the resources and infrastructure to screen their blood supply consistently for contamination with HIV and other TTVs. Because rates of HIV infection are still reaching new populations, particularly in Eastern Europe and Asia, HIV qualifies as an emerging virus in parts of the world. Another cause of concern is the appearance of new subtypes and the overall increasing genetic diversity of HIV [21] . Blood donor screening tests were initially developed and validated to detect the main group (group M), subtype B HIV-1 virus: a reflection of the predominance of this HIV strain in North America and Europe. Worldwide, however, non-subtype B strains of HIV-1 group M predominate. In the past, existing antibody assays did not perform as well with non-subtype B viral strains [22] , causing concern that infections with such strains could be missed. Ongoing surveillance studies monitor the emergence of new HIV variants [23] and the effectiveness of routine HIV test kits in detecting these viruses.",

The seroprevalence of HHV-8 among United States blood donors has been reported in regional studies to be as high as 20% to 25% [26] . However, a recent multicenter study of 1000 donors from five representative United States regions, involving seven state-of-the-art assays, found a seroprevalence of only 3% to 3.5% and no evidence of donor viremia [27] . These findings are in agreement with epidemiologic studies that suggest that sexual contact is the preferred route of HHV-8 transmission, whereas blood-borne transmission is an unlikely event [28, 29] .

It has recently attracted more attention because of the realizations that viremia is relatively common in blood donors, that inactivation of the virus is not easy and reliable, and that recipients of blood and blood products include patient populations that are increasingly vulnerable to infection and its sequelae. The virus causes an exanthematic illness called fifth disease in infants and a generally asymptomatic acute infection in adults [32] . Most infections occur in those 6 to 15 years of age, such that approximately 50% of adults are seropositive for parvovirus B19 antibodies. The virus is classified as an erythrovirus, reflecting its tropism for erythroid progenitor cells through its receptor, the erythrocyte P antigen [33] . The P antigen is expressed on megakaryocytes, endothelium, placenta, fetal liver, and fetal heart cells, but erythroid precursor cells are the most susceptible. Following infection, neutralizing antibodies appear. Patients with sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, and other conditions associated with shortened red cell survival are at risk for developing acute aplastic or hypoplastic anemia following infection. Others who are at risk for aplasia following parvovirus infection include immunodeficient patients, HIV-infected patients, solid organ transplant recipients, and children with malignancies. Immunocompromised patients may develop severe chronic anemia due to persistent parvovirus infection. Acute parvovirus infection during pregnancy may result in fetal loss, neurologic abnormalities, and congenital infection [34] . Red blood cell aplasia and chronic anemia due to parvovirus infection often respond to infusion with immune globulin preparations [35] .",

On the other hand, transmission from plasma-derived products has been a significant concern, because of the near ubiquity of the virus in the large plasma pools that are the source material for plasma products and its resistance to common inactivation methods. Although the presence of neutralizing antibodies in the plasma pool provides some protection, this does not guarantee recipients will not be infected [36] . Prospective studies in previously untreated hemophilic patients who received virus-attenuated factor concentrates demonstrated a persistent 40% risk of parvovirus infection [37] . Fortunately, these patients in general do not suffer serious or long-term hematologic sequelae, regardless of HIV serostatus [37] . Parvovirus DNA has also been detected in albumin preparations, and earlier studies suggested that the routine 10-hour pasteurization step at 60(C in the manufacturing process may not be effective in inactivating the virus. However, a more recent study using a cell culture system for human parvovirus indicates that the virus is rapidly destroyed by heating, consistent with the good safety record of albumin with regard to parvovirus transmission [38] . Recently implemented NAT screening of source plasma to exclude high-level viremic donations from use in manufacturing promises to reduce the risk of parvovirus infection from these products [39] . Further elimination of the virus from manufactured plasma products may be enabled by development of an effective nanofiltration method [40] .",

This phenomenon, termed zoonosis, was also responsible for the epidemics of HIV (derived from simian immunodeficiency viruses) and HTLV (derived from simian T-lymphotropic viruses). Zoonotic transmissions and epidemics can be expected to continue and perhaps increase in the future, because of such factors as shrinking natural habitats, increased human activities around wildlife, and more frequent international travel, trade, and migration. When humans are exposed to new viruses in this way, the lack of immunity in the population has the potential to cause devastating pandemics such as the past global outbreaks of influenza and the ongoing AIDS pandemic. With the exception of West Nile virus (discussed in detail later in this article), none of the viruses that may be considered emerging human pathogens are blood-borne organisms in the classical sense, and they are therefore not likely to be transmitted by transfusion. Nevertheless, episodes of viremia have been documented in SARS [44] , prompting temporary prophylactic deferral of blood donors at risk for the disease. SARS is probably not unusual in this respect; it can be assumed that periods of asymptomatic viremia also occur in other zoonotic infections that have caused disease outbreaks in humans. Another unknown but potential threat is that zoonotic viruses might acquire new mutations as they adapt to the human host that could change their mode of transmission and alter other properties, increasing transmissibility and pathogenicity in general [45] .",

The natural life cycle of the virus includes certain species of female mosquitoes as vectors, with birds serving as the primary vertebrate hosts that replicate the virus to high titer (amplifying hosts).

The median age of affected recipients was 63 (range 13 to 82); four had WNV encephalitis, one had West Nile fever, and one critically ill patient did not have discernible WNV-compatible illness despite confirmed WNV infection. Each had received multiple blood components, including single infectious units collected during the summer months of 2003. The presumptive transmitting donations were nonreactive by pooled screening but tested positive upon retrospective testing on an archived undiluted sample, demonstrating the capability of WNV to be transmitted by transfusion at very low levels (estimated median viremia from four of the six transmission cases was 0.11 plaque-forming units/mL). None of the donors reported WNV illness before or after donation.

Gram-positive skin saprophytes account for most of the organisms contaminating platelet concentrates, with the remaining contaminations attributed to gram-negative organisms associated with occult bacteremia. Most fatal reactions are due to endotoxin reactions associated with gram-negative bacteria. Platelet concentrates contaminated with Bacillus species, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Staphylococcus aureus, S epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Streptococcus species account for 85% of fatal reactions [59] . Moreover, although the bacterial content in a contaminated component at the time of collection may be exceedingly small, bacteria propagate during component storage (unlike viruses), resulting in a many log increase in concentration and release of endotoxin and other toxic metabolites. The minimum bacterial doses in platelet concentrates needed to produce morbidity or mortality are not known precisely, although bacterial concentrations of 10 8 colony-forming units per mL have consistently resulted in fatalities [60] .",

In a determined effort to further reduce bacterial contamination and septic transfusion reactions, US Blood Centers and Transfusion Services were expected to implement systems that detect and limit bacterial contamination in platelets in early 2004 [61] . Most detection systems require sterile sampling of platelet components 24 hours after phlebotomy (to allow viable bacteria to propagate to detectable levels). Approximately 4-mL to 10-mL samples of the platelet component are inoculated into automated culture systems where bacteria are detected through evidence of oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide generation in enriched growth media. Though generally successful, these methods have natural limitations due to slow growth rates and the lack of easily detectable metabolic products in some pathogenic bacteria. Several nonculture bacterial detection systems have also been described [54] . Finally, more effective prevention of bacterial contamination can be achieved by the use of newer skin disinfection solutions during donor phlebotomy and diversion of the first 15 mL of collected blood (which are then used for blood typing and infectious disease screening). These methods alone or in combination may reduce the bacterial load in skin fragments trapped in the phlebotomy needle that subsequently enter blood storage containers [62, 63] .",

It is to be hoped that evidence of lower bacterial contamination rates attributable to the new safeguards will permit return to a 7-day platelet storage period, which was standard before rising rates of septic reactions in the 1980s forced implementation of the current 5-day storage period.

Efforts to eradicate the vector have resulted in a decrease in new infections in endemic areas. Infected persons maintain a low-level, intermittent parasitemia that usually persists for life; treatment is only effective in eradicating the parasite when rendered during the initial acute stage. Vector transmission is unlikely outside endemic areas, but 50,000 to 100,000 infected Latin American immigrants reside in the United States, and congenital transmission may contribute to the reservoir of infected persons among immigrant communities [84] . At least six transfusion-associated cases of Chagas' disease have been reported in immunocompromised patients in the United States and Canada since 1989. In all cases the implicated donors were T cruzi-infected Latin American immigrants, and in five of the six cases platelets appeared to be the transmitting component [85] . The low number of confirmed cases of transfusion-transmitted Chagas' disease in North America may be misleading, because they involved fulminant disease in immunosuppressed patients; transmissions in immunocompetent recipients with asymptomatic or mild acute disease may be overlooked.",

CJD is one of a variety of prion diseases of humans that occur spontaneously at a rate of approximately 1 per million throughout the world and can be transmitted vertically in familial conditions such as Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome or horizontally through ritualistic cannibalism (kuru).",

Nevertheless, because of the long incubation phase of the disease (as demonstrated from growth hormone transmissions), concern arose in the mid-1990s that CJD transmission could occur from asymptomatic donors to blood transfusion recipients [93] . This theoretic risk led to the establishment of enhanced donor deferral policies (based on iatrogenic exposure or family history of the disease) for potential CJD carriers. Several recent epidemiologic studies have confirmed earlier studies in failing to establish a link between transfusion and transmission of CJD [93] .

In contrast to classical CJD, vCJD disease is new, first reported in the United Kingdom in 1996 [94] . Over the first several years of investigation, it was proved that the causative agent of vCJD (probably also a prion) is the same agent that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). A massive epidemic of BSE occurred in Great Britain in the 1980s and early 1990s as a result of the recycling and processing of material (offal) from dead sheep and cattle into food meal for cattle. Although this practice was stopped in the mid-1990s following appreciation of the BSE epidemic, an estimated 250,000 cattle had already been infected with BSE. Transmission of the BSE prions to humans occurred by oral consumption of beef and other cattle products containing reticular endothelial or neural tissue, resulting in a delayed outbreak of vCJD in the United Kingdom (Fig. 4) .",

This measure was predicted to reduce the number of donors potentially infected with vCJD by approximately 70% and to result in the deferral of approximately 2.5% of otherwise eligible donors.

Immediate improvement in blood safety can be expected from the adoption of more effective methods to prevent bacteria from entering blood donations and from mandatory implementation of bacterial detection systems. The overall threat from novel and emerging pathogens will be more difficult to address, because multiple agents are involved and the risks of transmission by transfusion and adverse outcomes in recipients are generally not well defined. Discussions about appropriate measures to protect the blood supply from agents like SARS, vCJD, and West Nile virus are ongoing, illustrating the challenge of finding the right balance between the desire and mandate for safety and the need to maintain an adequate and affordable blood supply. Past experience has shown, for example, that closure of the infectious window periods through implementation of new molecular assays can result in significantly enhanced safety, but at a very high cost. Whereas serologic screening of donors for HBV, HIV, and HCV was essentially cost-neutral (ie, the cost of testing was offset by the savings in prevented infections/disease), the costs for NAT testing exceed $1 million per infection prevented or per quality-adjusted life year saved [101] . Pathogenreduction methods currently under development promise effective protection from most TTVs and other pathogenic organisms (with the exception of prions), but these methods could nearly double the cost of platelet and RBC components and are likely to raise new safety concerns when they are moved from the trial stage to clinical practice [90, 91, 102] .",

It is important that surveillance activities be conducted on a global scale. Outbreaks of new viral diseases often start in developing nations but, by means of international commerce and travel, can spread to any region of the world overnight. Proactive surveillance through collaboration with blood collection programs in developing countries is a critical barrier to such an event, as are efforts to assist local agencies with the establishment of sustainable blood collection, processing, and transfusion systems [73, 107] .
