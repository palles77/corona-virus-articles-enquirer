            "text": "Modern industrial economies have overlapping transportation networks represented principally by road, rail, air, and marine services. Each mode of transport has its inherent strengths and may be used exclusively in some circumstances, but more often two or more modes of transport are involved in the delivery of freight. The locations where goods are transshipped from one mode to another are the nodes of the network. Cities emerge at these transportation nodes to operate as hubs and gateways. Burghardt (1971) defines the difference between transportation hubs and gateways by their geographic characteristics. Hub cities have circular hinterlands where goods are shipped to and from smaller centers. Gateway cities have a one-sided hinterland; the other side is barren in an economic sense. Gateways are located at the edges of their economic regions and serve trade corridors that link its region with another gateway or hub across an \"infertile\" space. There, goods are transshipped between road, rail, or water for delivery to the final consumer. As a derived demand, transportation networks expand to serve the needs of shippers and receivers. Larger population centers generate more demand and consequently are the best equipped with infrastructure to accommodate transshipments between transportation modes. A hierarchy of transportation gateways and hubs evolves to accommodate the flow of goods from production to final consumption. The kinds of nodes that form at particular locations depend on geographical features, political barriers, and established infrastructures. Distance and terrain usually dictate the most favorable routes in which gateways and hubs become established on trade corridors.",

            "text": "A trade corridor can be described as any pathway that facilitates the movement of goods between two or more cities within a broader network of transportation links and nodes that form an economic region. The cities that form trade corridors compete for growth and market share. The largest cities in the hierarchy possess infrastructures and institutions that benefit from economies of scale that smaller cities cannot achieve. The dominant cities can provide more diverse transport connections such as international airports and intermodal rail yards, and higher-level commercial services such as appellate courts, banking, and specialized education. At the very pinnacle of the hierarchy are cities that host national and international insurance, financial services, and entertainment industries. Taylor et al. (2011) define nine world regions and rank the hierarchy of cities based on their commerce and control. At the national scale, they define cities in terms of how \"vertical\" or \"horizontal\" they appear in terms of population size. A vertical distribution is where one \"primate city\" dominates, such as London, Paris, or Mexico City. A more horizontal distribution can be found in countries such as Germany and China where several important cities vie for influence without any one dominating. Politics and commerce may combine to increase the influence of cities in the hierarchy. Primate cities that are also capitals are more likely to be the dominant air hubs, but not necessarily freight hubs depending on their location. Coastal primate cities such as Tokyo, New York, and Buenos Aires combine sea and air gateways to intercontinental corridors.",

Cities on the corridor route can be further classified as distribution hubs and gateways. Burghardt (1971) developed a model of a gateway city that provides a useful framework for considering the entry points of trade corridors. Fig. 2 .1 illustrates the hinterlands of hub and gateway cities, and their relation to trade corridors. The hub cities have circular hinterlands that are at the top of their economic hierarchy. The gateway cities have a one-sided hinterland that funnels traffic in and out of its region along a trade corridor. Hub cities rest on one or more major corridors that bisect its circular hinterland. Transportation infrastructure radiates out from the hub city to serve smaller centers within its hinterland. Goods are received from the smaller cities at the hub for consumption and transshipment to other locations, and in reverse, goods received from distant locations are distributed within the hub city's hinterland. A classic example of a transportation hub is Kansas City, Missouri. This city, which is situated close to the geographic center of the United States, is served by two major interstate highways, four class 1 railways, and all the major airlines.",

Most gateway cities serve only one end of a major corridor that feeds traffic into and out of its region. The one-sided, cone-shaped hinterland is shaped by some geographical transition point or political barrier to trade. Gateway cities lie at the extremes of their geographic regions to transship freight between their \"fertile\" side and across an \"infertile\" region on the other side. The fertile side has a well-developed multimodal network of transportation infrastructure. The infertile side is served by long haul transportation services that connect the gateway city to a distant market.",

            "text": "Traffic is funneled through a gateway city because it sits at a strategic location along a land corridor or a sea route where transportation costs can be minimized. Ocean ports are obvious gateway cities, but Burghardt observes that internal gateway cities can emerge where continental features create the right conditions. For example, gateway cities can become located because of mountain ranges, deserts, rivers, and inland seas. Calgary, Alberta, owes its size and location to the strategic Rogers Pass that provides a key transportation corridor through the Rocky Mountains. Calgary emerged as a gateway to distribute goods from British Columbia to the fertile hinterland of the Canadian prairies. Winnipeg was founded as an eastern gateway to this prairie region. With the barren Canadian Shield to its east and north, Winnipeg funneled trade from across eastern prairies over a long corridor that linked to Montreal and Europe. The location of the gateway at Winnipeg was favored because traffic had to be transshipped across the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. The Winnipeg gateway to Western Canada became solidified when the Canadian Pacific Railway bridge was built across the river and fixed the route of the trans-Canadian trade corridor. Whebell (1969) notes that all modern land trade corridor routes became fixed with the construction of the rail lines. Although cars and trucks have greater route flexibility, centers that were already served by rail were subsequently more desirable to connect with highways. In North America, the railway infrastructure is oriented with stronger and more direct east/ west corridors than north/south corridors. Even in the case of air travel, which is not tied to fixed infrastructure routes, it is generally easier and faster to fly east/west in North America than to travel north/south. This reflects another source of gateway locationdpolitical boundaries.",

Sovereign states also impose regulations that limit foreign transport competition (cabotage restrictions) and favor the transfer of goods to domestic transportation systems. Like seaports, sovereign borders within a trading bloc stimulate land settlement patterns and employment to serve international trade. It is unclear whether either Calgary or Winnipeg would have grown into major cities if the United StateseCanada border had not limited the reach of American cities further south.

The history of Chicago and St. Louis is instructive. Located at the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, St. Louis had been the gateway to western development for nearly 75 years before Chicago was incorporated as a town (Cronon, 1991) . During the age of barges and canals, geography funneled passengers and goods through St. Louis's natural river corridors. In contrast, Chicago had to depend on a seasonal, circuitous route through the Great Lakes and the Eire Canal with its 36 locks. As advances in iron smelting and the telegraph allowed the railways to use longer trains and provide faster, year-round service, they began to outcompete river-barge transport after 1855. Chicago became the foremost railway gateway of North America, while St. Louis became a regional city in its shadow.",

When the rail age emerged, Philadelphia became focused on this coal and steel manufacturing industry and ignored its western trading partner (Cronon, 1991) . The New York interests pushed railway investment to link up with Chicago, and New York became the dominant east coast gateway. A similar change in the MontrealeWinnipeg strategic partnership occurred in Canada during the 1970s with the rise of the Separatist movement in Quebec. Business headquarters in Montreal shifted to Toronto and its strategic western partner Calgary. With the decline of Montreal, Winnipeg faded in importance as the regional center of business and distribution in Western Canada (Prentice, 2006) .",

New technologies on the horizon such as driverless trucks and cargo airships could also favor new gateways at the expense of others.

Between the hubs of A and B, they travel on larger airplanes sized for the longer flights and traffic demand. Mason (2010) addresses the question of air transport hubs and gateways with a preliminary quantitative analysis of traffic patterns at 23 major airports in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. He collects data on domestic, continental, and intercontinental flights as well as descriptive Transport Networks and Impacts on Transport Nodes data on city size, location from the coast, number of carriers, proximity of competing airports, and national population and GDP.

The intermodal transshipments from ocean carriers to railways, from truck to rail at intermodal container terminals, and from airplane to truck transfers occur at the gateways. Delfmann (2010) suggests that this distinction loses relevance because feeder traffic is increasingly found at gateways, and the modal choice in hub-and-spoke networks increasingly involves different modes of transport.

Cities lower in the hierarchy are usually more focused on either goods or services, and can operate more like gateways or hubs. Fig. 2 .3A presents a three-dimensional model of the hierarchy, in which different cities at the same level serve as gateways or hubs with greater proportions of goods and services in their economy. The largest centers generally have a combination of transport modes, but as cities have become more service oriented, a single airport hub may be the most important mode of transport. An example of a city at the bottom of the hierarchy could be an industrial port that is built to serve a single commodity export, such as iron ore.",

New York and London are the primate cities sitting at the top of the Anglo-American hierarchy. The cities lower in the hierarchy are smaller in population and have fewer corporate head offices. Boston and San Francisco are gateways with high service focus. Chicago and Vancouver are gateways that are stronger in freight flows. Toronto and Calgary operate more like hub cities for air traffic distribution warehouses and they are the first and second in numbers of head offices. These are hubs with significant service sectors, including tourism. Atlanta and Kansas City are hub cities that serve large circular hinterlands for the movement of goods and people. Pain (2010) observes two paradoxes in this new role for gateways. First, as cities increase their global connectivity, interurban economic dependencies Transport Networks and Impacts on Transport Nodes are extending and intensifying. A clustering of synergistic intercity linkages becomes more important as these cities become more global. In the case of New York, a cluster of activity encompassing New Jersey and the surrounding megalopolis support the goods movement and feed its industrial activity. The second paradox is that established gateway and corridor roles are becoming detached from, but increasingly dependent on, the physical infrastructures. Notwithstanding Cairncross (1997) views on the death of distance, flexibility and openness to virtual and physical flows are both important to global competitiveness.",

            "text": "Corridors that serve gateways and hubs vary in length depending on their function and hinterland size. Rodrigue and Hesse (2007) consider four cases. Short-distance corridors exist within gateways and hubs to move goods from port terminals to sorting and marshalling areas. An example is the Alameda rail corridor that serves the ports of Los Angeles/Long Beach, California. This corridor consolidates four rail branch lines into a 15-m wide, 10-m deep trench containing three rail lines. It eliminates 200 at-grade crossing conflicts and reduces the transit time from 2 h to less than 1 h. Containers are carried approximately 32 km through the trench, then another 99 km on connecting rail lines to a cluster of distribution facilities at the Inland Empire. Short-distance corridors can reduce congestion in the port area or compensate for a lack of space. The Inland Empire has ample space to conduct transshipping and sorting. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are now considering on-dock rail loading to reduce the twothirds of their containers that are still moved through the city by trucks (Tirschwell, 2015) . The second case is hinterland access corridors that expand the market area of the gateway and reduce costs. The Port of Prince Rupert, British Columbia, is hemmed in by mountains. Consequently, container stuffing for shipment through the port has been established 720 km east at Prince George, British Columbia. A similar strategy underlines the development of rail corridors in heavily populated locations such as the east coast of the United States. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has established the Port Inland Distribution Network and the Port of Virginia has an associated rail terminal called the Virginia Inland Port to reduce distribution costs.",

A second and more plausible landbridge is a containerized rail link that takes its inspiration from the historic Silk Road between Asia and Europe.

The nodes can offer firms the benefits of agglomeration. Each firm locating at the node can gain from its diversity and contribute to the diversity of the city. Larger centers offer opportunities for economies of size, access to labor markets, and easier access to input suppliers.

Bandyopadhyay and Goetz (2010) describe the desire to be on a corridor as \"bypass phobia,\" the fear of being left out of economic development opportunities. History provides examples in which local business leaders fought to get railway access. The business leaders at Denver, Colorado, built a spur line to connect to the Union Pacific Railroad at Cheyenne, Wyoming, when the transcontinental was routed there instead. The city of Winnipeg built a railway trestle across the Red River and promised the Canadian Pacific Railway tax-free land to bring the transcontinental route 30 km south. In both cases, the investment paid off because these cities became the largest centers in their jurisdictions. Ironically, in the case of Winnipeg and many other cities, local politicians are now lobbying to have the rail lines routed around the city.",

Also the volume of container drayage movements to and from these port terminals adds to traffic congestion and city streets may be blocked by container trains.

In addition to silk, furs, jade, ceramics, spices, paper, iron, and bronze were shipped westward from China. The returning eastbound cargoes were gold, gems, ivory, glass, textiles, and perfume.

There is no evidence of direct contact, as represented by Roman coins, until the Byzantine era (Frankopan, 2015; Hansen, 2012) .

Bulk shipping is the movement of loose cargoes, such as grain, fertilizers, coal, and minerals, that are loaded with mechanical handling equipment, such as \"clam-shell\" cranes and conveyors, into the ship's holds. Breakbulk cargo is packaged in smaller containers such as boxes, drums, and crates, and loaded with cranes and nets. The introduction of ISO container shipping has led to a steady decline in breakbulk cargoes. Breakbulk is still used for out-of-gauge cargo, which is essentially anything that will not fit in a standard ISO container, but most packaged goods are containerized. Levinson (2006) chronicles the impacts of containerization since its inception in 1957. Prior to containerization, approximately half the cost of shipping breakbulk goods across the Atlantic Ocean occurred at the port. All outbound goods were unloaded at the port, placed on pallets, and moved into a transit shed to await the ship's arrival. Once the ship docked, the goods were lifted by cranes off the dock and down into the ship's hold. There, the pallets were unloaded into the various decks. Levinson illustrates the process for one ship (the SS Warrior) that carried 5015 long tons from New York to Germany in 1954. The cargo list contained 194,582 individual pieces, mainly food and general freight, that were packed in cases, cartons, bags, bundles, drums, barrels, reels, crates, and just about every other conceivable packaging form. These export goods arrived at the port in 1156 separate shipments from 151 different cities in the United States. The ship took 6 days to load (single 8-h shifts) and 4 days (around the clock) to unload at Germany. Compared to 10.5 days to cross the Atlantic, this ship spent almost as much time docked at the ports. Today, container ships carrying 10 times the volume can be loaded and unloaded in a single day. The lower cost of containerized ocean transport has allowed manufacturers to create global supply chains.",

This is especially true if the goods being transshipped are costly to handle or perishable. Processing can also be advantageous at a gateway if several raw materials are being sourced from different locations. The creation of the steel industry at Tokyo is an example. Metallurgical coal, iron ore, and limestone can be transported by sea and combined with domestic scrap metal to produce quality steel. Weight or volume-reducing processes can also take advantage of a gateway location. Ocean transport is less costly than land transport, so any reduction in weight or volume lowers total distribution cost.",

The costs of transport are summed vertically to obtain the total costs. At the consumer market, the distribution costs are assumed to be zero for finished goods, so the transportation costs are just for the procurement of the raw materials. Similarly, at the resource market, only the distribution costs to ship the finished goods to the consumer market are considered. If the processing occurs at the transshipment point, the procurement costs of the raw material by sea and the distribution costs of the finished goods by land are summed to obtain the total costs. Note that the procurement costs of the raw materials and distribution costs of the finished goods shift vertically at the transshipment point d*. This reflects the transshipment costs of unloading and reloading different vehicles. Given the model presented in Fig. 2.4 , a processing location at the transshipment point is favored because it has the lowest total costs. Containerization has also changed the economics of industrial location because the costs of transshipping have decreased substantially.

In contrast, countries such as the United States with wellestablished corridors move the goods and establish the jobs where the people are located. Of course, this was not always the case. The largest cities in most of the industrially advanced countries are located on the coast because when they were being founded, their internal corridors were inefficient and expensive, too, just like China and most developing economies are today. Transport Networks and Impacts on Transport Nodes Bulk handling has received less attention in examinations of the gateway activities because of the dramatic rise of containerization. It is also true that bulk handling has fewer linkages within the gateway of exporters and consequently less employment impact. Nevertheless, the efficiency of bulk handling is critical to the competitiveness of countries that depend on natural resource exports. The import gateways for commodities handled in bulk are more likely to be the location for processing because these goods are usually heavy and low in value. Grain is a good example of a bulk commodity that fits this description. The port facilities for exporting grain comprise large storage terminals and rail sidings for receiving and transshipping to ocean-going ships. The port facilities of the importing countries often feature flour mills and oil processing plants. In any case, locations that engage in bulk handling are almost always gateways rather than hubs.",

Containerization has grown rapidly by shifting breakbulk shipments into containers, but it has also started to convert commodities that traditionally moved in bulk into the container supply chain. In part this has occurred because of the great imbalance of container shipping on the Pacific Ocean. The increasing exports of Asian manufactured goods, since the beginning of the 21st century, far exceeds its imports. Over half of all west-bound containers on the Pacific return empty, and are available at very low backhaul rates. This has also been accompanied by rising incomes and increasing demand for grain in Asia. Grain shippers have realized this opportunity. Approximately 15% of total grain exports from North America now move in containers to Asia outside the established bulk grain supply chain (Prentice and Hemmes, 2015) . In the United States, grain is being loaded into containers at Chicago and Kansas City that favors shipment through Los Angeles/Long Beach, which have not been traditional export ports for grain.",
