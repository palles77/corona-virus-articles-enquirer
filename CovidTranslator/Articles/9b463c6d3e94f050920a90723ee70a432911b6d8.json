            "text": "The oviduct epithelium consists of ciliated and secretory cells which play an important role in key reproductive processes such as sperm capacitation, fertilization and early embryonic development. Bovine oviduct epithelial cells have been widely used in co-culture experiments to condition culture media and improve early embryonic development [1] . However, these cells dedifferentiate during in vitro culture and manifest alterations like loss of cilia and secretory granules, reduction of cell height and flattening on the culture surface [2] . The trials for long term culture of oviduct cells, ensuring a better polarization and differentiation of the cells, include culture of oviduct cells on matrigel supports or collagen filter inserts. In this study, we have compared three different membrane supports for their potential to maintain ultrastructural features and monolayer integrity of bovine oviduct epithelial cells during in vitro culture.",

The culture of oviduct epithelial cells was done in TCM-199 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum at 39\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 & 20% O 2 . The development of primary cultures was assessed daily and the medium was renewed every 48 hours. After 3 weeks of monolayer culture, the ultrastructural features of oviduct cells were examined by scanning electron microscopy while the integrity of monolayer was tested by transepithelial electrical resistance and permeability to radiolabeled 14 C-Mannitol. Non-parametric statistical analysis was done using Kurskal-Wallis Test.",
