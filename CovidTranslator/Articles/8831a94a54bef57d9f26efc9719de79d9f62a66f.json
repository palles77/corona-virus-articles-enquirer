The leakage plume exposure probability was highest about 60 to 80 mm lateral to the median sagittal plane of the HPS. Without nasal bridge leakage, the jet plume from the exhaust holes increased to a 0.40-m radius from the mask, whereas exposure probability was highest about 0.28 m above the patient. When IPAP was increased to 18 cm H 2 O, the vertical plume extended to 0.45 m above the patient with some horizontal spreading along the ward ceiling. Conclusion: Substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs within a 0.5-m radius of patients receiving NPPV. Medical wards should be designed with an architectural aerodynamics approach and knowledge of air/particle dispersion from common mechanical ventilatory techniques. (CHEST 2006; 130:730 -740) ",

This system requires a method to discharge excess gas flow and pressure to the environment through a bleeding port. 2 NPPV is effective in the treatment of patients with respiratory failure due to COPD and acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and of immunocompro-mised patients with pneumonia. 1 Anecdotal reports have indicated that NPPV applied via a single circuit was effective in treating patients with respiratory failure due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and might reduce the need for intubation.

The outbreak several years ago of the SARS virus with high infectivity, 6, 7 and its potential to spread by airborne transmission 8 -11 highlighted the risk of viral pneumonia. The reemergence of avian H5N1 infection with a high rate of respiratory failure in humans since 2004 in Asia has highlighted the potential need for providing mechanical ventilation in environments that are safe for HCWs. 12, 13 The US pandemic influenza plan 14 has recommended airborne precautions for HCWs when managing pandemic influenza with increased transmissibility and during procedures that may generate small aerosol particles of respiratory secretions. It is not known how exhaled air and particles may disperse during NPPV in clinical settings because there is no reliable marker that can be safely introduced to the patients. We therefore assessed the risks of single-circuit NPPV in spreading infectious particles through the bleeding port and the orofacial mask interface using a high-fidelity human patient simulator (HPS) . Knowledge about the extent and direction of mask leakage is essential in preparation for an influenza pandemic to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission during the application of NPPV to high-risk patients.",

The lung compliance and airway resistance also respond in a realistic manner to relevant challenges.

This extended the laser flow visualization and provided a useful quantitative method for understanding the range and shape of the leakage jet plumes. This analysis technique was previously developed for turbulent, two-phase air-particle flows and was shown to be reliable compared to isokinetic sampling 21 and particle image velocimetry. 22 The laser light sheet illuminated the smoke particles in the mask airflow leakage. We assumed the intensity of the laser light sheet was constant (Fig 2, middle, B) because the mask was positioned relatively far from the optics. Scattered laser light perpendicular to the light sheet was collected and integrated by the video camera charge-coupled device element (Fig 2, bottom,  C) . For a small region, the number of smoke particles within the region (or the particle concentration) is proportional to the total scattered light intensity in that small region if each particle scatters an equal intensity of light. This is true when particles are monodisperse, as scattering is dependent on particle size. 23 For most types of smoke, the particles are essentially monodisperse with a tight size distribution. 20, 24 This analysis was based on the scattered light intensity being proportional to the particle concentration under the special conditions of constant-intensity laser light sheet illumination and monodisperse small (submicrometer) particles.",

The In general, there would be a \u03fd 10% probability of exposure if the HCW was standing outside the light blue contour regions. Similarly, if the HCW was standing outside a radial distance of approximately 0.25 m from the mask, there would be \u03fd 10% chance of exposure to exhaled air. Bottom, B: sagittal plane and paramedian planes parallel to the sagittal plane. This panel shows that the laterally directed exhaust holes create jet plumes that tend to \"reinforce\" each other about 60 to 80 mm laterally from the mask. This shows that the highest probability of encountering the patient's exhaled air is not directly above the mask in the sagittal plane, but to the \"side,\" where an HCW may typically stand. leakage jet plume was most significant at approximately 60 to 80 mm lateral to the median sagittal plane. Despite what initially appeared to be a reasonably well-fitted mask, there was still leakage detected at the nasal bridge. With the elimination of this nasal bridge leakage, the jet plume radial distance from the mask increased to 0.4 m, whereas exposure probability was highest at approximately 0.28 m above the patient and the mask. When IPAP was increased to 14 cm H 2 O and then to 18 cm H 2 O, the vertical plume extended to 0.42 and 0.45 m, respectively, above the patient and the mask, with some horizontal spreading along the ceiling. These findings have important clinical implications for HCWs, who often nurse their patients at a close distance, especially during NPPV support for respiratory failure at a stage when the viral loads of the patients may reach peak levels. Our study emphasizes the importance of medical ward design in terms of a ventilated, aerodynamic space and the need for an \"architectural aerodynamics\" approach in order to minimize the risk of nosocomial infection. Air-conditioning or extraction systems will need to target the circular region that is above the mask rather than at the actual mask level. It is controversial whether patients with respiratory failure due to severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) would benefit from NPPV. NPPV lowered the intubation rate, the length of stay in the ICU, and the 2-month mortality rate in patients with severe CAP, but these beneficial actions were confined to those patients with underlying COPD. 28 In a prospective observational study 29 that excluded patients with underlying COPD, NPPV improved oxygenation and respiratory rate in 22 of the 24 patients with CAP during the initial trial, but 16 patients subsequently needed intubation after an average time of 1.3 days, mainly because of worsening respiratory failure.",

The profile of concentration probability along a line 300 mm above the mask (y \u03ed 0 mm on contours and x is the horizontal coordinate, exactly as in the contour plots) is plotted for each of the three IPAP settings (ie, 10, 14, and 18 cm H 2 O), whereas EPAP was maintained at 4 cm H 2 O. The variation in the shapes represented a turbulent jet flow, which was highly variable. the usage of NPPV was low. Nevertheless, individual reports [3] [4] [5] have shown that single-circuit NPPV might provide life-saving treatment for patients who were in respiratory failure as a result of the infection. Treatment with NPPV was applied via oronasal masks to 20 SARS patients without COPD in whom severe hypoxemic respiratory failure developed in a hospital ward environment with efficient room air exchange, stringent infection control measures, full personal protective equipment, and the addition of a viral-bacterial filter to the exhalation port of the NPPV device. 5 Endotracheal intubation was avoided in 14 patients (70%) who had a much shorter ICU LOS than those who were intubated. Clinical evidence of SARS did not develop in any of the 105 HCWs involved in the management of the 20 patients, whereas 102 HCWs (97%) had negative SARS serology findings. 5 As there were still three HCWs who had refused to undergo blood testing, one cannot entirely eliminate the possibility of subclinical SARS infection related to use of NPPV, although it seemed highly unlikely. 30 Subclinical SARS infection did occur in other HCWs who cared for SARS patients. 34, 35 The reemergence of avian influenza H5N1 in humans in Asia and the recent spread to the Middle East is of grave concern. 12, 13, 36, 37 The infectivity potential for human-to-human transmission may increase with time after the mutation or genetic reassortment of viruses. 38 Most of the human patients with H5N1 infection have presented with severe pneumonia complicated by ARDS and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, and have a high mortality rate. 12, 13, 36, 37 The evidence for the use of NPPV as ventilatory support for patients with ARDS is weak, especially in the presence of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and the lack of data from a controlled trial. 39, 40 However, treatment with NPPV may play a role in reducing the need for endotracheal intubation among those patients with acute lung injury in an influenza pandemic, if it is applied with caution.",

            "text": "NPPV should be applied in patients with severe viral pneumonia only if there is adequate protection for HCWs because of the potential risk of viral transmission via deliberate or accidental mask interface leakage and flow compensation causing the dispersion of a contaminated aerosol. 30 In patients with chronic respiratory failure who are receiving NPPV via nasal masks, air leakage through the mouth or other routes besides the exhalation valve can occur. 2 In clinical practice, pressure necrosis often develops at the skin around the nasal bridge if the mask is applied tightly for a prolonged period of time. Many patients loosen the mask strap to relieve discomfort, and air leakage from the nasal bridge is definitely a potential source for the transmission of viral infections. Careful mask fitting is important for the successful and safe application of NPPV. The addition of a viral-bacterial filter to the NPPV breathing system between the mask and the exhalation port 3,5 or the use of a dual-circuit NPPV device may reduce the risk of the nosocomial transmission of viral infection. However, the use of viral-bacterial filters was difficult due to blockage by moist secretions and could be applied only in some cases. 3, 5 In view of our observation that higher ventilator pressures result in a wider dispersion of exhaled air and a higher concentration of air leakage, we recommend starting NPPV with low IPAP level (ie, 8 to 10 cm H 2 O) and gradually increasing the level as necessary, instead of starting high and titrating downward if the patient is intolerant. 41 There are several limitations to this study. First, smoke particles were used as markers for exhaled air, but they might not fully reflect the risk of droplet transmission. Our results indicate the spatial extent of the airflow leakage jet plumes but do not directly indicate the behavior of potentially infected droplets themselves. It is known that droplets generated by coughing, sneezing, talking, and breathing range from 0.5 to 12 m in diameter 42,43 with a density similar to that of water. As these droplets are generally much larger than smoke particles (ie, they have a higher Stokes number), they will not follow the jet plume airflow perfectly but will slip relative to air streamlines under the influence of Stokes drag and gravitational forces. Stokes drag carries droplets with the airflow of the jet plume, but inertia causes droplets to lag behind the airflow and fall short of the full extent of the air jet plume. Conversely, gravitational force causes droplets to follow trajectories that are vertically below the air jet plume. We would therefore expect droplets to extend somewhat vertically below the contours given here but less than the contours given in directions vertically above and to the sides of the jet plume. The contours and safe distances suggested here are likely the \"upperbound\" conservative estimates for droplet spread above and to the sides of the mask. Using the laser visualization method, we have shown that during the delivery of oxygen at a rate of 4 L/min via a Hudson mask to the HPS, the exhaled air at the peak of simulated exhalation could reach a distance of approximately 0.40 m. 44 Last, we tested only one type of NPPV machine and one oronasal mask without supplemental oxygen, and did not test a nasal mask due to limited resources. Nevertheless, oronasal masks are generally preferred in the application of NPPV for acute respiratory failure as nasal masks are poorly tolerated in the acute setting due to mouth breathing. 45 Further studies are needed to assess the safety of different respiratory therapies such as the addition of viral filters in the circuit, the use of supplemental oxygen, the use of a humidifier, and the use of different ward airflow settings, and to determine how the medical ward environment should be designed to protect HCWs from acquiring nosocomial pneumonia.",
