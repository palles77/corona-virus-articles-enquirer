            "text": "Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are a significant burden on global economies and public health 1-3 . Their emergence is thought to be driven largely by socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors 1-9 , but no comparative study has explicitly analysed these linkages to understand global temporal and spatial patterns of EIDs. Here we analyse a database of 335 EID 'events' (origins of EIDs) between 1940 and 2004, and demonstrate non-random global patterns. EID events have risen significantly over time after controlling for reporting bias, with their peak incidence (in the 1980s) concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are dominated by zoonoses (60.3% of EIDs): the majority of these (71.8%) originate in wildlife (for example, severe acute respiratory virus, Ebola virus), and are increasing significantly over time. We find that 54.3% of EID events are caused by bacteria or rickettsia, reflecting a large number of drugresistant microbes in our database. Our results confirm that EID origins are significantly correlated with socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors, and provide a basis for identifying regions where new EIDs are most likely to originate (emerging disease 'hotspots'). They also reveal a substantial risk of wildlife zoonotic and vector-borne EIDs originating at lower latitudes where reporting effort is low. We conclude that global resources to counter disease emergence are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and surveillance effort focused on countries from where the next important EID is least likely to originate.",

            "text": "In the global human population, we report the emergence of 335 infectious diseases between 1940 and 2004. Here we define the first temporal origination of an EID (that is, the original case or cluster of cases representing an infectious disease emerging in human populations for the first time-see Methods and Supplementary Table 1 ) as an EID 'event'. Our database includes EID events caused by newly evolved strains of pathogens (for example, multi-drugresistant tuberculosis and chloroquine-resistant malaria), pathogens that have recently entered human populations for the first time (for example, HIV-1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus), and pathogens that have probably been present in humans historically, but which have recently increased in incidence (for example, Lyme disease). The emergence of these pathogens and their subsequent spread have caused an extremely significant impact on global health and economies [1] [2] [3] . Previous efforts to understand patterns of EID emergence have highlighted viral pathogens (especially RNA viruses) as a major threat, owing to their often high rates of nucleotide substitution, poor mutation errorcorrection ability and therefore higher capacity to adapt to new hosts, including humans 5, 8, 10, 11 . However, we find that the majority of pathogens involved in EID events are bacterial or rickettsial (54.3%). This group is typically represented by the emergence of drug-resistant bacterial strains (for example, vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Viral or prion pathogens constitute only 25.4% of EID events, in contrast to previous analyses which suggest that 37-44% of emerging pathogens are viruses or prions and 10-30% bacteria or rickettsia 5, 8, 11 . This follows our classification of each individual drugresistant microbial strain as a separate pathogen in our database, and reflects more accurately the true significance of antimicrobial drug resistance for global health, in which different pathogen strains can cause separate significant outbreaks 12 . In broad concurrence with previous studies on the characteristics of emerging human pathogens 5, 8, 11 , we find the percentages of EID events caused by other pathogen types to be 10.7% for protozoa, 6.3% for fungi and 3.3% for helminths (see Supplementary Data and Supplementary Table 2 for a detailed comparison to previous studies).",

Controlling for reporting effort, the number of EID events still shows a highly significant relationship with time (generalized linear model with Poisson errors, offset by log(JID articles) (GLM P,JID ), F = 96.4, P < 0.001, d.f. = 57). This provides the first analytical support for previous suggestions that the threat of EIDs to global health is increasing 1,2,14 . To further investigate the peak in EID events in the 1980s, we examined the most frequently cited driver of EID emergence during this period (see Supplementary Table 1) . Increased susceptibility to infection caused the highest proportion of events during 1980-90 (25.5%), and we therefore suggest that the spike in EID events in the 1980s is due largely to the emergence of new diseases associated with the HIV/AIDS pandemic 2,13 .",

The number of EID events caused by pathogens originating in wildlife has increased significantly with time, controlling for reporting effort (GLM P,JID F = 60.7, P < 0.001, d.f. = 57), and they constituted 52.0% of EID events in the most recent decade (1990-2000) (Fig. 1) .

This rise corresponds to climate anomalies occurring during the 1990s 16 , adding support to hypotheses that climate change may drive the emergence of diseases that have vectors sensitive to changes in environmental conditions such as rainfall, temperature and severe weather events 17 . However, this controversial issue requires further analyses to test causal relationships between EID events and climate change 18 . We also report that EID events caused by drug-resistant microbes (which represent 20.9% of the EID events in our database) have significantly increased with time, controlling for reporting effort (GLM P,JID F = 5.19, P< 0.05, d.f. = 57).

Environmental parameters that promote pathogen transmission at lower latitudes (for example, higher temperatures and precipitation) are hypothesized to drive this pattern 19 . Our analyses suggest that there is no such pattern in EID events, which are concentrated in higher latitudes ( Supplementary Fig.  1 ). The highest concentration of EID events per million square kilometres of land was found between 30 and 60 degrees north and between 30 and 40 degrees south, with the main hotspots in the northeastern United States, western Europe, Japan and southeastern Australia (Fig. 2 ). We hypothesize that (1) socioeconomic drivers (such as human population density, antibiotic drug use and agricultural practices) are major determinants of the spatial distribution of EID events, in addition to the ecological or environmental conditions that may affect overall (emerging and non-emerging) human pathogen distribution 19 , and (2) that the importance of these drivers depends on the category of EID event. In particular, we hypothesize that EID events caused by zoonotic pathogens from wildlife are significantly correlated with wildlife biodiversity, and those caused by drug-resistant pathogens are more correlated with socio-economic conditions than those caused by zoonotic pathogens.",

We found that human population density was a common significant independent predictor of EID events in all categories, controlling for spatial reporting bias by country (see Methods, Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3 ). This supports previous hypotheses that disease emergence is largely a product of anthropogenic and demographic changes, and is a hidden 'cost' of human economic development 2, 4, 7, 9, 13 . Wildlife host species richness is a significant predictor for the emergence of zoonotic EIDs with a wildlife origin, with no role for human population growth, latitude or rainfall ( Table 1 ). The emergence of zoonotic EIDs from non-wildlife hosts is predicted by human population density, human population growth, and latitude, and not by wildlife host species richness. EID events caused by drug-resistant microbes are affected by human population density and growth, latitude and rainfall. The pattern of EID events caused by vector-borne diseases was not correlated with any of the environmental or ecological variables we examined, although we note that the climate variable used in this analysis (rainfall) does not represent climate change phenomena.",

A visualization of the regression results from Table 1 for EID events from each category (Fig. 3) identifies these regions globally. This approach may be valuable for deciding where to allocate global resources to pre-empt, or combat, the first stages of disease emergence 10, 14, 18, 22 . Our analysis shows that there is a high spatial reporting bias for EID events (see Methods, Supplementary Fig. 3) , reflecting greater surveillance and infectious disease research effort in richer, developed countries of Europe, North America, Australia and some parts of Asia, than in developing regions. This contrasts with our risk maps (Fig. 3) , which suggest that predicted emerging disease hotspots due to zoonotic pathogens from wildlife and vectorborne pathogens are more concentrated in lower-latitude developing countries. We conclude that the global effort for EID surveillance and investigation is poorly allocated, with the majority of our scientific resources focused on places from where the next important emerging pathogen is least likely to originate. We advocate re-allocation of resources for 'smart surveillance' of emerging disease hotspots in lower latitudes, such as tropical Africa, Latin America and Asia, including targeted surveillance of at-risk people to identify early case clusters of potentially new EIDs before their large-scale emergence. Zoonoses from wildlife represent the most significant, growing threat to global health of all EIDs (see our data in Fig. 1 , and recent reviews 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14 ) . Our findings highlight the critical need for health monitoring 4,14,23 and identification of new, potentially zoonotic pathogens in wildlife populations, as a forecast measure for EIDs. Finally, our analysis suggests that efforts to conserve areas rich in wildlife diversity by reducing anthropogenic activity may have added value in reducing the likelihood of future zoonotic disease emergence.",

Global allocation of scientific resources for disease surveillance has been focused on rich, developed countries ( Supplementary Fig. 3) . It is thus likely that EID discovery is biased both temporally (by increasing research effort into human pathogens over the period of the database) and spatially (by the uneven levels of surveillance across countries). We account for these biases by quantifying reporting effort in JID and including it in our temporal and spatial analyses. JID is the premier international journal (highest ISI impact factor 2006: http://portal.isiknowledge.com/) of human infectious disease research that publishes papers on both emerging and non-emerging infectious diseases without a specific geographical bias. To investigate the drivers of the spatial pattern of EID events, we compared the location of EID events to five socio-economic, environmental and ecological variables matched onto a terrestrial one degree grid of the globe. We carried out the spatial analyses using a multivariable logistic regression to control for co-variability between drivers, with the presence/absence of EID events as the dependent variable and all drivers plus our measure of spatial reporting bias by country as independent variables (n = 18,307 terrestrial grid cells). Analyses were conducted on subsets of the EID events-those caused by zoonotic pathogens (defined in our analyses as pathogens that originated in non-human animals) originating in wildlife and non-wildlife species, and those caused by drug-resistant and vector-borne pathogens.",

Therefore, we focus on EID 'events', which we define as the first temporal emergence of a pathogen in a human population which was related to the increase in distribution, increase in incidence or increase in virulence or other factor which led to that pathogen being classed as an emerging disease 2, 4, 5, 8, 13, 15 . We chose the 1940 cut-offbased on the Institute of Medicine's 2 examples of a currently or very recently emerging disease, all of which had their likely temporal origins within this time period. Single case reports of a new pathogen were not considered to represent the emergence of a disease, and emergence was normally represented by reports, in more than one peer-reviewed paper, of a cluster of cases that were identified in humans for the first time, or (for previously known diseases) considered significantly above background. Only events that had sufficient corroborating evidence for their geographic and temporal origin were included in our analysis. We based our data collection on the list of EIDs in ref. 5 updated to 2004 . Unlike this previous study 5 , we treated different drug-resistant strains of the same microbial species as separate pathogens and the cause of separate EID events (for example, the emergence of the chloroquine-resistant strain of the malaria pathogen (Plasmodium falciparum) in Trujillo, Venezuela in 1957 and the sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine-resistant strain in Sa Kaeo, Thailand in 1981).",

Some EID event locations were lesser known and only described sub-regionally or regionally (for example, SARS in \"Guangdong Province, China\" or enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli in \"Peru\"). These locations were assigned corresponding boundaries from ESRI sub-regional or regional data 24 and we randomly selected only one grid cell from the possible grid cells to represent each particular event.
