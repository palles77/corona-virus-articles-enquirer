Objective: We sought to examine the prevalence of rhinovirus infections in relation to the atopic status of children treated for wheezing in Costa Rica, a country with an increased asthma burden. Methods: The children enrolled (n 5 287) were 7 through 12 years old. They included 96 with acute wheezing, 65 with stable asthma, and 126 nonasthmatic control subjects. PCR methods, including gene sequencing to identify rhinovirus strains, were used to identify viral pathogens in nasal washes. Results were examined in relation to wheezing, IgE, allergen-specific IgE antibody, and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide levels. Results: Sixty-four percent of wheezing children compared with 13% of children with stable asthma and 13% of nonasthmatic control subjects had positive test results for rhinovirus (P < .001 for both comparisons). Among wheezing subjects, 75% of the rhinoviruses detected were group C strains. High titers of IgE antibodies to dust mite allergen (especially Dermatophagoides species) were common and correlated significantly with total IgE and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide levels. The greatest risk for wheezing was observed among children with titers of IgE antibodies to dust mite of 17.5 IU/mL or greater who tested positive for rhinovirus (odds ratio for wheezing, 31.5; 95% CI, 8.3-108; P < .001). Conclusions: High titers of IgE antibody to dust mite allergen were common and significantly increased the risk for acute wheezing provoked by rhinovirus among asthmatic children.

[1] [2] [3] [4] After 3 years of age, rhinovirus accounts for 75% to 80% of the virus-induced attacks leading to hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, and the majority of these children are atopic. 1, 5 Evidence to date also indicates that a rhinovirus infection together with sensitization and exposure to inhaled allergens increases the risk for acute symptoms, suggesting that these risk factors might act synergistically to provoke asthma exacerbations. 1, 5, 6 Whether these observations can be generalized to children living in countries with tropical climates is not clear. In studies from Brazil and Trinidad, the prevalence of infections with rhinovirus among children treated for asthma was less than half of what has been reported in countries with temperate climates. 7, 8 Recognizing that additional studies are needed from tropical environments to gain a better understanding of the role of viral infections in the cause of asthma exacerbations worldwide, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the prevalence of viral respiratory tract infections among children treated for acute wheezing in Costa Rica and to evaluate the results in relation to their atopic status.",

            "text": "Costa Rica is a small country (19, 730 square miles) in Central America with a diverse ecosystem. Similar to other countries near the equator, Costa Rica has 2 seasons: a ''dry'' season (generally December through April) and a ''rainy'' season (May through November). Exposure to Helminthes, which, like environmental allergens, can stimulate the production of IgE, is common in economically deprived regions of Hispanic America. However, anti-helminth medications are given annually to children in Costa Rica starting at 1 year of age. Thus active parasitic and enteric infections during childhood are not frequent in that country (eg, < _2% for infections with Ascaris lumbricoides). 9, 10 According to school surveys and studies using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire, the prevalence of asthma among school-aged children in Costa Rica (approximately 23% to 27%) is higher than in North America, 11, 12 and sensitization to allergens, especially to allergens produced by house dust mites, is common. 13 At present, however, there is little information about the relevance of viral infections to acute attacks of asthma in this country. Additionally, recent evidence from countries with temperate climates suggest that group C strains of rhinovirus might be strongly related to asthma exacerbations compared with other strains. [14] [15] [16] This information is also lacking in studies of asthma in tropical countries. Thus our objective was to investigate the relationship between respiratory tract viruses, including different strains of rhinovirus, and episodes of asthma requiring acute treatment. Additionally, we took advantage of the dominance of dust mite sensitization in Costa Rica to investigate the relationship of titers of IgE antibodies to exacerbations of asthma with or without evidence of a recent viral infection.",

Subjects included 96 children referred to the acute care nebulization room for wheezing by a triage physician. They required at least a nebulized bronchodilator (albuterol) for treatment. Children seen in the ED for nonwheezing disorders (n 5 191) were enrolled as control subjects. They included 65 children who had been hospitalized or treated in the ED or who had been using medications prescribed by a physician for asthma during the last 12 months. Data from the latter group, who were defined as having ''stable asthma'' at the time of enrollment, were compared with data obtained from the actively wheezing children and other nonwheezing control subjects in a post hoc analysis.

A high degree of concordance was observed between RT-PCR and real-time PCR methods for detecting rhinovirus (percentage of absolute agreement, 93.3%; 95% CI, 89.8% to 95.9%). Additionally, strains of rhinovirus and enterovirus were identified by means of PCR and sequencing of a region comprising the VP4 and partial VP2 capsid protein genes. 21, 22 Measurements of total serum IgE, allergen-specific IgE antibody, and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide levels Blood (5 mL) was obtained by means of venipuncture, and serum from each sample was analyzed for the total IgE level by using the Phadia ImmunoCAP assay (Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden). Each sample was also analyzed for allergenspecific IgE antibody to dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, and Blomia tropicalis), Alternaria species, Aspergillus species, cockroach (Periplaneta americana and Blattella germanica), Bahia grass, cat and dog allergens, and A lumbricoides. Sera with 0.35 IU/mL or greater IgE antibody to any of the allergens tested were considered positive for allergen sensitization. Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) levels were measured with a portable FENO analyzer (NIOX MINO; Aerocrine, Inc, New Providence, NJ).",

In previous studies from Brazil and Trinidad, rhinovirus infections were not associated with attacks of asthma as strongly as has been reported in studies from countries with temperate climates. 7, 8 Differences in lifestyle (eg, quality of drinking water, rates of helminth infection, and amount of time spent indoors [at home or in school]) might explain differences in the rates of infection; however, both Costa Rica and the region of Brazil around S\u00e3o Paulo have developing westernized lifestyles, and a strong association between atopy and asthma was observed in both countries. Strains of rhinovirus within groups A, B, and C were also evaluated for all positive tests for rhinovirus in our study. The majority of wheezing children were infected with group C strains (ie, 75% positive for group C and 25% positive for group A strains; both significantly associated with wheezing [ Table II] ). Other studies of children treated for exacerbations of asthma have also reported a higher frequency of infection with group C strains. 14, 15 Thus far, no studies have shown a significant association between asthma and group B strains.",

Data from the nonasthmatic control subjects in the present investigation, as well as from younger children evaluated for respiratory tract infections in other studies, suggest that the frequency of infections with group A and C strains might be similar. 16, 21 This suggests that the airway in patients with asthma might be more susceptible to infections with group C strains. At present, the receptor used by group C viruses to infect epithelial cells is not known. The cell-surface receptor used by group A strains is the adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). 23, 24 Previous studies, including our own, indicate that the expression of ICAM-1 (both soluble and membrane ICAM-1) is reduced in the asthmatic airway, 25, 26 which might give group C viruses a selective advantage for infecting the asthmatic respiratory tract epithelium.

Most striking was the significant increase in the probability of wheezing with a recent rhinovirus infection among children with titers of IgE antibodies to D pteronyssinus of 17.5 IU/mL or greater.

[32] [33] [34] These results are consistent with results from our experimental challenges with RV-16, demonstrating that the levels of FENO were significantly increased before the virus inoculation among asthmatic patients with high levels of total IgE. 25 Together, the results suggest that preexisting allergic inflammation is the main risk factor for an asthmatic response to rhinovirus.

Thus far, antiviral treatments, including vaccines, to treat infections with rhinovirus have been difficult to develop because of antigenic diversity among rhinovirus strains. The predisposition of asthmatic patients to become infected with group C strains might offer a more targeted approach for developing antiviral treatments. However, this approach would not be effective for the 40% of wheezing children who did not have positive test results for rhinovirus in this study and might not be effective in preventing attacks of asthma caused by group A strains. Alternatively, treatments focused on decreasing allergic airway inflammation could provide a broader approach to prevent and/or decrease the severity of asthma exacerbations caused by rhinovirus. Thus results from this study provide strong evidence that characterizing the atopic status of asthmatic children in greater detail, including their titers of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, is needed both to enhance investigations focused on mechanisms of rhinovirusinduced attacks of asthma and to identify children who are most likely to benefit from allergen-specific therapies.",
