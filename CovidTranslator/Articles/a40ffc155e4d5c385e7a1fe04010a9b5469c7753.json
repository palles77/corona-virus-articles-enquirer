            "text": "Coronavirus RNA synthesis is performed by a multienzymatic replicase complex together with cellular factors. This process requires the specific recognition of RNA cis-acting signals located at the ends of the viral genome. To identify cellular proteins involved in coronavirus RNA synthesis, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) genome ends, harboring essential cis-acting signals for replication, were used as baits for RNA affinity protein purification. Ten proteins were preferentially pulled down with either the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 ends of the genome and identified by proteomic analysis. Nine of them, including members of the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein family of proteins (hnRNPs), the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), the p100 transcriptional co-activator protein and two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, showed a preferential binding to the 3\u2032 end of the genome, whereas only the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) was preferentially pulled down with the 5\u2032 end of the genome. The potential function of the 3\u2032 end-interacting proteins in virus replication was studied by analyzing the effect of their silencing using a TGEV-derived replicon and the infectious virus. Gene silencing of PABP, hnRNP Q, and glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS) caused a significant 2 to 3-fold reduction of viral RNA synthesis. Interestingly, the silencing of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), initially used as a control gene, caused a 2 to 3-fold increase in viral RNA synthesis in both systems. These data suggest that PABP, hnRNP Q, and EPRS play a positive role in virus infection that could be mediated through their interaction with the viral 3\u2032 end, and that GAPDH has a negative effect on viral infection.",

Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been classified in three different groups based on antigenic and genetic criteria. The most extensively studied group members are the TGEV and the human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E from group 1, the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (SARS-CoV) from group 2, and the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) from group 3. CoV infections cause a variety of diseases relevant in animal and human health, being of special relevance the SARS in humans (Drosten et al., 2003; Perlman et al., 2000) . After the SARS outbreak in 2002 the interest to understand the molecular basis of CoV replication increased and, as a result, in the last years more than 30 new CoVs have been identified with a broad host distribution (Vijaykrishna et al., 2007) .",

The CoV genome resembles the structure of most cellular mRNAs, containing a cap structure at the 5\u2032 end, a poly(A) tail at the 3\u2032 end, and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs). The replicase gene, that occupies the 5\u2032 two thirds of the genome, includes two overlapping open reading frames (ORF 1a and ORF 1b) that are translated into two large co-amino-terminal polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, the second one expressed by a ribosomal frameshift mechanism (Brierley et al., 1989) . Both polyproteins are autoproteolytically cleaved into up to 16 mature products (nsp1 to nsp16), which are believed to be part of the replication-transcription complex (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . CoV replicase gene is extremely complex and, besides the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and helicase activities, it encodes other enzymes less frequent or exclusive among RNA viruses (Masters, 2006; Snijder et al., 2003; Ziebuhr, 2005) , such as an endoribonuclease, a 3\u2032-5\u2032 exoribonuclease, a 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferase, a ribose ADP 1\u2033 phosphatase, and a second RNAdependent RNA-polymerase (Imbert et al., 2006) . In addition to the Virology 391 (2009) [304] [305] [306] [307] [308] [309] [310] [311] [312] [313] [314] replicase components, the viral nucleoprotein has been shown to play a major role in CoV RNA synthesis (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2004; Schelle et al., 2005) . The resulting virus-encoded replication-transcription complex presumably associates with host-cell proteins to complete the synthesis of viral RNA (Enjuanes et al., 2006; Masters, 2006) .",

The relevance of the 3\u2032 end-interacting proteins on TGEV infection was analyzed using RNA silencing approaches. A significant and highly reproducible reduction of 2 to 3-fold in RNA synthesis and virus titer was evidenced after silencing the expression of PABP, hnRNP Q and EPRS proteins, suggesting that these factors play a positive role in TGEV infection. Interestingly, silencing of the control gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) caused a 2 to 3-fold increase in TGEV RNA synthesis and virus titer, suggesting that this protein might have a role counteracting TGEV infection.",

Three independent RNA pull down assays were performed and all the proteins showing a preferential binding for one of the TGEV genome ends were excised from the gels and identified by mass spectrometry. A set of 10 proteins was reproducibly identified in at least two out of three experiments with significant MASCOT scores (p N 0.05).

Transfection efficiency of siRNAs and silencing were initially optimized using a Cy3-labeled validated-siRNA against the GAPDH gene, reaching transfection efficiencies close to 100% and a reduction of 80% at the mRNA level (data not shown). Synthetic siRNA duplexes against the GAPDH (silencing positive control) and the candidate genes were transfected twice into 293T cells to allow sustained mRNA silencing for at least 70 h in order to achieve detectable silencing at the protein level (Fig. 4A ). Chemically modified siRNAs (Silencer Select siRNA, Ambion) were used in order to reduce the dose of transfected siRNAs and the potential off-target effects (Elmen et al., 2005) . In addition, two different siRNAs per target were tested separately. Six hours after the second siRNA transfection, the TGEV replicon was transfected and total RNA and protein were isolated at 36 and 48 h posttransfection (90 and 102 h after the first siRNA transfection, respectively) to evaluate silencing of the target gene and the replicon activity ( Fig. 4A ).

The silencing window of PABP, hnRNP Q, and EPRS at the mRNA level reached a maximum at 48 h after the first transfection (data not shown) that was prolonged at least until 102 h posttransfection (Fig. 4B) . A reduction of 80% at the RNA level was detected for the positive control gene GAPDH. In the case of the target genes, the reduction in mRNA levels was dependent on siRNA sequence and it was within 70-95% for at least one siRNA of PABP and EPRS genes, and around 60% for both siRNAs of hnRNP Q gene (Fig. 4B ). Silencing at the protein level was evaluated at 102 h after the first transfection of the siRNAs. A reduction of about 50% for hnRNP Q and between 65 and 85% for GAPDH, PABP and EPRS was observed (Fig. 4C ). Viral mRNA 7 expression was quantified as a measure of replicon activity at 36 and 48 h after the replicon transfection (90 and 102 h after the first siRNA transfection, respectively). A reproducible and significant reduction in replicon activity of 2 to 3-fold for PABP, hnRNP Q, and EPRS gene silencing was observed in comparison to reference levels from cells transfected with a validated negative control siRNA (Fig. 4D ), suggesting that these factors have an important positive effect on replicon RNA synthesis. Reduction of replicon activity was transient, showing a good correlation with the lowest protein levels after silencing and a dose-depending effect in relation to the silencing potency of different siRNA sequences (Fig. 4D ). Interestingly, a significant increment of about 3-fold in the replicon activity was observed after GAPDH silencing (Fig. 4D ), indicating that GAPDH has a negative effect on replicon RNA synthesis. Although these effects were moderate, they were highly reproducible and statistically significant, and of similar magnitude than those reported in other viral systems (Hara et al., 2009; Pettit Kneller et al., 2009 ).",

As described for the replicon system, the transfection efficiency of siRNAs and silencing were optimized in Huh-7 cells using a Cy3-labeled validated-siRNA against the GAPDH gene (data not shown). In addition, only the siRNAs providing higher silencing efficiencies for each target gene were chosen to perform the phenotypic assays (Table 2 and Fig. 4 ). Synthetic siRNAs were transfected into Huh-7 cells by reverse transfection and at 48 h posttransfection the cells were infected with the TGEV PUR46-C11 strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5. A single siRNA transfection step was sufficient to achieve sustained mRNA and detectable protein silencing at the times of the phenotypic analysis. Total RNA was isolated at 36 and 72 h postinfection (84 and 120 h after transfection of the siRNAs, respectively) to evaluate silencing at the mRNA level and viral RNA synthesis by Q-RT-PCR with specific Taqman gene expression assays (Fig. 5A ). Silencing efficiency at mRNA level was within the 85-95% range for GAPDH, PABP, hnRNP Q, and EPRS genes (Fig. 5B ). Silencing at the protein level was evaluated at 120 h after siRNAs transfection, and a reduction higher than 65% was observed for all tested proteins (Fig. 5C ). Viral RNA synthesis was quantified at 36 and 72 h postinfection and a significant effect was observed at 72 h postinfection. This time point corresponds with maximum TGEV PUR46-C11 RNA synthesis in Huh-7 cells. Similar to the replicon system, a reproducible and significant reduction of 2-fold in the viral RNA synthesis was evidenced after silencing of PABP, hnRNP Q and EPRS genes, in comparison with the reference levels from cells transfected with a validated negative control siRNA (Fig. 5D ). In accordance with the observation made with the TGEV replicon, a significant increment on viral RNA synthesis of about 2-fold was observed upon GAPDH silencing (Fig. 5D ). Virus production was quantified at 72 h postinfection by titrating the supernatants from silenced Huh-7 cells on ST cells. In agreement with the effects observed in viral RNA synthesis, a reproducible reduction in virus titers to 36-50% was observed in cells silenced for PABP, hnRNP Q and EPRS genes, while a 340% increase was detected in cells silenced for the GAPDH gene (Fig. 5D ). These results indicate that the silencing of PABP, hnRNP Q, EPRS, and GAPDH genes have a significant impact both on virus RNA synthesis and infectious virus production.",

            "text": "RNA viruses have often evolved to subvert host-cell factors in favor of their own gene expression (Ahlquist et al., 2003; Lai, 1998) . During the course of CoV infection, the interactions of specific RNA genome motifs with viral or cellular components probably regulate the initial replicase translation, the switch from translation to RNA synthesis and packaging of progeny genomes. In previous studies in group 2 CoVs, several cellular proteins interacting with different RNA domains at the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 UTRs have been identified by UV-crosslinking and RNA affinity protein isolation approaches (Shi and Lai, 2005; Spagnolo and Hogue, 2000; Yu and Leibowitz, 1995) . Nevertheless, limited studies have been performed with group 1 CoVs. In this study a set of 10 cellular proteins preferentially binding to the first 500 nt from either the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 ends of the TGEV genome was identified and the relevance in virus infection of GAPDH and the 3\u2032 end-interacting proteins PABP, hnRNP Q and EPRS, was determined. Considering that the 3\u2032 end is the initiation site for replication that starts with the synthesis of the negative strand, the proteins interacting with the 3\u2032-cis-acting replication signals could play a key role at the initial stage of RNA replication. In addition to the critical role of both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 genome ends in CoV replication, the genome ends most likely also contain signals that regulate the translation, transcription and RNA stability (Masters, 2006; Ziebuhr, 2005) . Thus, the proteins identified in this study could be involved in any of these processes.",

Although these proteins are predominantly nuclear factors, most of them can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm associated to mRNA (Caudy et al., 2003; Ghetti et al., 1992; Mizutani et al., 2000; Myer and Steitz, 1995; Pinol-Roma and Dreyfuss, 1993; Weighardt et al., 1995) . On the other hand, nuclear proteins could be translocated to the cytoplasm during infection affecting viral replication, as described for other cytoplasmic RNA viruses (Lai, 1998 ). An example of this phenomenon was previously reported for the hnRNP A1 that relocates during infection from the nucleus to the sites of MHV RNA synthesis in the cytoplasm (Li et al., 1997) . CoV transcription involves the fusion of non-continuous sequences by a discontinuous RNA synthesis mechanism different from conventional RNA splicing but with the same end result. The participation of cellular splicing factors could be critical for assisting this process during CoV transcription by bringing distant RNA sequences in close proximity. Among these splicing factors, PTB, hnRNP A1, and hnRNP Q have been previously shown to interact with MHV genome ends and to be involved in viral RNA synthesis (Choi et al., 2002 (Choi et al., , 2004 Li et al., 1999; Shen and Masters, 2001; Shi et al., 2000 Shi et al., , 2003 . In this study, we have found two additional splicing factors, hnRNP A2B1 and hnRNP A0, specifically associated to the 3\u2032 end of TGEV genome. In addition, a preferential co-purification of the hnRNP Q with the 3\u2032 end of the TGEV genome was observed, whereas the studies on MHV were limited to interaction with the 5\u2032 end UTR (Choi et al., 2004) . Furthermore, hnRNP Q silencing experiments showed a significant reduction in TGEV RNA synthesis and virus production in agreement with the effects observed after hnRNP Q silencing in MHV infected cells that produced a delay in viral RNA synthesis and syncytium formation (Choi et al., 2004) .",

Nevertheless, our studies report the first direct evidence of the effect of this protein in CoV RNA synthesis. CoV genomes mimic cellular mRNAs and are presumed to translate their genomes in a cap and poly(A)-dependent manner. The binding of cap-recognizing factors to the 5\u2032 end and the interaction of the PABP with the poly(A) tail, could circularize the viral genome for translation. This mechanism would favor the recycling of ribosomes, the selection of complete molecules as templates and the controlled regulation of the switch between translation and RNA synthesis that occurs in opposite directions.",

TGEV replicon activity in 293T cells after silencing the expression of TGEV 3\u2032 end-interacting proteins. (A) Experimental design. The bar on top represents the TGEV-derived replicon (REP 2) that contains the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs, the replicase (ORF 1a and ORF 1b), the nucleoprotein (N), and the 7 genes (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2004) . The time-line of the silencing and phenotypic assay is represented below. The time points refer to hours after the first transfection (hpt) of the siRNAs. 293T cells were transfected (T1) with either a validated negative control siRNA, an siRNA against the GAPDH gene (silencing positive control), or the siRNAs against the target genes (Table 2) , seeded over poly-lysine-treated 96-well plates, and retransfected with the same siRNAs (T2) before the transfection with the TGEV replicon (T3). The time points at which the RNA and proteins were extracted to evaluate the silencing and replicon activity are also indicated. (B) Silencing of cellular genes at the mRNA level. The percentage of mRNA remaining after the silencing of target genes PABP, hnRNP Q and EPRS or the control gene GAPDH was quantified by Q-RT-PCR, in comparison to reference levels from cells transfected with a validated negative control siRNA. Two different siRNA sequences (#1 and #2) were transfected separately to silence each target gene. Time points as in panel A. (C) Silencing of cellular genes at the protein level. Total cellular protein was extracted at 102 h after the first transfection of the siRNAs and the silencing was evaluated by immunoblotting. The \u03b2-actin was used as loading control.

Levels of mRNA 7 are represented as the foldchange in comparison to reference levels from cells transfected with a negative control siRNA. Only the time point (36 or 48 h after transfection of the replicon) in which the effect on the replicon activity was the highest is shown.

The PCR was performed with the oligonucleotides XmaI-SP6p-G-5\u2032TGEV-VS that includes the SP6 promoter and 5\u2032TGEV-504-RS (Table 3 ). The resulting amplicon was purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (QIAGEN), precipitated with 0.1 vol of sodium acetate 3M pH 5.2 and 2.5 vol of cold 100% ethanol (sodium acetate-ethanol precipitation), resuspended in Tris-HCl 10 mM pH 7.5, and then used as template for the in vitro transcription reactions. The last 493 nt at the 3\u2032 end of TGEV genome were amplified from the plasmid pM33L-637G using the oligonucleotides XmaI-T7p-GGG-ORF7-VS (Table 3 ) that introduces the T7 promoter preceding the viral sequence and HindIII-poly(A)-RS (Table 3 ) that includes a 25 nt poly(A) tail. The PCR amplicon was digested with XmaI and HindIII and cloned into the same restriction sites of the plasmid pM33L-637G to generate the plasmid pM33L-3\u2032template. The plasmid pM33L-3\u2032-template was linearized with HindIII, deproteinized by phenol chloroform extraction, precipitated by sodium acetate-ethanol precipitation, and resuspended in the reaction buffer of the Mung Bean nuclease (New England Biolabs). In order to generate a precise TGEV genome 3\u2032 end, the linearized plasmid pM33L-3\u2032-template was then treated with Mung Bean nuclease to degrade the three-nucleotide single-strand extension generated after the HindIII digestion, following the manufacturer's conditions. The template was deproteinized by phenol chloroform extraction, precipitated by sodium acetate-ethanol precipitation, resuspended in Tris-HCl 10 mM pH 7.5, and then used for the in vitro transcription reactions. In all cases the PCR reactions were performed with the Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommended conditions. All cloning steps were checked by sequencing the PCR-amplified fragments and cloning junctions.",
