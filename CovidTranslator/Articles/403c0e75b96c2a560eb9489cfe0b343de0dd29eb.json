            "text": "In 1938, Hobart Reimann described a group of patients with an initial mild respiratory illness, often accompanied by headache and sore throat, progressing to pneumonia without sputum production. Because this was a picture very different from the well-known presentation of acute pneumococcal pneumonia, Reimann coined the term 'atypical pneumonia' to describe these cases. His observation was confirmed by subsequent similar reports and it was noted that the etiologic agents for these illnesses were unidentifiable on Gram stain and not recovered by culture methods used at the time.",

Clinical features of atypical and typical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) overlap, and the etiology of CAP cannot be determined on demographic, clinical, or radiologic features. However, the term 'atypical pneumonia' remains a useful one and describes a clinical picture characterized by more pronounced systemic than respiratory symptoms, bilateral patchy or interstitial infiltrates on chest radiographs, and negative results on sputum Gram stain and routine cultures.",

Confirmation of the diagnosis of the infection usually relies upon detecting complement-fixing (CF) antibodies. Positive results are defined by more than fourfold rise in antibody titer (acute to convalescent) and single titer X1:32. Antibody titers rise 7-10 days after infection, and peak at 3-4 weeks. Newer immunoassays may be more sensitive and specific than CF serologies. The IgM capture test is optimal to diagnose M. pneumoniae in children. An enzymelinked immunoassay that detects IgG is preferred for adults as they may not elaborate an IgM response. As results are not available for 3-4 weeks, serologies are performed infrequently in clinical practice. However, they are invaluable for epidemiological investigations and tracking epidemics.

A fourfold rise in CF antibodies against Chlamydia or a single titer of X1:64 is considered evidence of acute infection. Microimmunofluorescence (MIF) is more specific, but is technically difficult and is performed only in research laboratories. Criteria for the diagnosis of acute C. pneumoniae by MIF include a single IgM titer of X1:16, a fourfold rise in IgG titer (acute to convalescent), or a single IgG titer of X1:512. In primary infections, IgM is evident at 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms, followed by the IgG response at 6-8 weeks. The immunologic response to infection with C. pneumoniae appears incompletely protective as re-infection can occur. Re-infections are associated with IgG responses (not IgM) after 1-2 weeks. Other diagnostic techniques for detecting Chlamydia infection include immunoassay (EIA), direct fluorescent antibody, and PCR. PCR can be applied to nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and is more sensitive than cultures.",

The number one pathogen causing CAP is pneumococcus, which is commonly resistant to multiple antibiotics, thus complicating management. Other common pathogens include atypical organisms (Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae), Hemophilus influenzae, enteric Gram-negatives (especially in those with chronic illness and aspiration risk factors), and Staphylococcus aureus. Successful management requires careful assessment of disease severity so that a site-of-care decision can be made (outpatient, inpatient, intensive care unit), appropriate samples for diagnostic testing collected, and antibiotic therapy initiated in a timely and accurate fashion. Initial antibiotic therapy is empiric, but even with extensive diagnostic testing, less than half of all patients have an etiologic pathogen identified. All patients with CAP require therapy for pneumococcus, atypical pathogens, and other organisms, as dictated by the presence of specific risk factors. Because pneumonia has both short-term and long-term impact on mortality, it is also important to focus on prevention of this illness, which requires smoking cessation, and giving at-risk individuals both pneumococal and influenza vaccines.",
