Both mouse strains were resistant to intraperitoneal infection with MHV 4 or MHVA 59 and only the A/J mice showed resistance to MHV 3, the BALB/c mice being fully susceptible to this virus infection. Comparable growth kinetics, for all three viruses, were observed in both mouse strains, except for the MHV 3 growth in BALB/c mice, where the virus titre increased to a peak on day 2, remaining high until day 4 when the mice died of acute hepatitis. The IFN gamma titres in the peritoneum of mice preceded and correlated with the virus growth, higher titres being found in MHV 3 infected BALB/c mice. The highest titre was always observed 24 to 48 h after infection. Among viral strains grown in cultured macrophages, higher titres were always observed in cultures infected with MHVA 59, followed by MHV 3 and the lowest those infected with MHV 4. The macrophage activation by IFN gamma-induced a partial restriction of virus growth only in MHV 3 infected A/J mouse macrophages. A virus specificity of the IFN gamma-induced antiviral state was shown to be in direct correlation with the resistance of mice to MHV 3 infection.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses cause a wide variety of diseases in several hosts [3, 17] . The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) group is widespread, occurring endemically in mouse colonies, many of which have antibodies against MHV. Different types of MHV have been isolated from a variety of mouse strains in different geographical areas under diverse conditions, and are related to acute, subacute, chronic, and persistent infections [6, 9, 22, 23] . The MHV 3, MHV4, and MHVA 59 strains of MHV, although morphologically and structurally very similar, are able to induce quite distinct pathological processes [26] . However, they have in common some features, such as the ability to infect and replicate in macrophages inducing cell lysis after cellular membrane fusion and multinucleated syncytium formation [-2, 25] . MHV 3 was isolated by Dick et al. [6] and has been used as a model of viral infection in which resistance is dependent on the genetic background of the mouse strain [1, 5, 8, [12] [13] [14] [15] 24] . A/J mice have been reported to be resistant to MHV 3 infection, developing only a mild disease which disappears 4 to 6 days later; BALB/c mice are susceptible, causing an acute hepatitis after infection and die 3 to 4 days later. The mechanisms suggested to be involved in this natural resistance include the antiviral state induced by interferon (IFN), the virus replication in target cells, and the expression of a monokine with procoagulant activity [1, 7, 1 t, t 8, 24] . Previously, we have shown that the resistance to MHV 3 infection can be a consequence of a T cell-dependent mechanism, in which the production of IFN gamma and the sensitivity of macrophages to IFN gamma play an essential role [-13-15] .",

Following an experimental infection, these viruses first replicate in the macrophages and among established strains of MHV, a wide variation in virulence and organ tropism is observed [25, 26] . For instance, they have been shown to be able to replicate in different liver cells, glial and neuronal cells and intestinal cells; the MHV 3 strain causes hepatitis [6, 18] the MHV 4 strain is highly neurotropic [4, 10] and the MHVA 59 strain is relatively non-pathogenic [21] . Viral and host factors play a pathogenetic role and the availability of susceptible and resistant mouse strains made the study of the resistance mechanisms involved possible. Previous work on MHV 3 postulated that both resistance gene(s) controlling the degree of viral replication in target cells and an intact immune response are required for the resistance [8] . In order to understand the relationship between the macrophage restriction of virus replication and the dependence on the immune system, we have performed a series of studies which led us to demonstrate that the resistance of A/J mice against MHV 3 infection is, in part, a consequence of a T cell-dependent mechanism, in which the production of IFN gamma and the sensitivity ofmacrophages to IFN gamma play a central role [13] [14] [15] .",

IFN gamma-activated A/J mouse macrophages were able to restrict the MHV 3 replication, but not that of MHV 4 or MHVA 59. The data also show that the differences in the IFN gamma-induction of antiviral state in A/J and BALB/c macrophages are specific for MHV 3 and correlates with the host resistance to this virus infection. Both mouse strains, although resistant to MHV 4 or MHVA 59, do not have macrophages able to express an antiviral state after IFN gamma activation, which suggests that an antiviral state induced in macrophages by IFN gamma is not involved in the mechanism responsible for the resistance against MHV 4 or MHVA 59 infection. However, the IFN gamma synthesized during the infection by these viruses may play a role in the modulation of the immune response generated in these animals. Also, the ability of these viruses to grow in the macrophages seems not to be of great importance for the outcome of the disease, since the virus growth did not correlate with the host resistance to the experimental infection. A cell receptor for these viruses has been recently identified as a glycoprotein related to the carcinoembryonic antigen [27] and the possibility of some cells to express a functional receptor and some other factor(s) required for virus entry into the cells have been implicated in the resistance or susceptibility [28] .",
