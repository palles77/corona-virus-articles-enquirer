            "text": "Viruses are the major cause of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in both adults and children. 1 ARI, including both influenza and the common cold, is a worldwide problem that accounts for significant loss of productivity and financial burden on the healthcare system. [2] [3] [4] Although various experimental 5 and epidemiological 6, 7 studies have identified viruses as the pathogens for most ARI, a significant number of ARI episodes have unknown etiologies despite improved diagnostic procedures. [8] [9] [10] It has been suggested that bacterial pathogens such as Haemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Moraxella catarrhalis contribute to ARI, however; results from studies have been inconclusive. 11, 12 Detection of bacteria is increased in symptomatic children 13, 14 and adults 11 compared to healthy controls. 15, 16 In a study involving 507 ARI sufferers 11 Heald et al (1993) reported 56% positive bacteria cultures from nasopharyngeal secretions of adults with ARI illness, but found no bacteria in healthy controls. However, Winther et al (1984) found no difference in nasal bacterial between healthy and ARI ill conditions. 12 Even so, antibiotics are often prescribed for uncomplicated ARI, 17 and widespread inappropriate use of antibiotics contributes to the emergence of antibiotic resistance and therefore to increased health care costs. 18 There is evidence that virus-induced inflammation contributes to respiratory symptoms. During the course of viral illnesses, there are significant correlations between interleukin-8 (CXCL8) 7 levels and neutrophil counts 19 in nasal secretions and cold symptom severity. There is some evidence that detection of bacterial pathogens during ARI may be associated with increased inflammatory biomarkers. 11 Given these findings, we hypothesized that during viral ARI, detection of specific bacterial pathogens would be associated with increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers and greater measures of severity of illness. A secondary goal was to examine nasal secretions for pathogenic bacteria in ARI adult sufferers with and without detectable viruses. The rationale for this stratified analysis is to determine if bacterial co-infection would lead to greater ARI illness severity compared to viral only or no pathogen detection. Stratification enabled us to determine whether symptoms were greater for \"bacteria plus virus\" vs. \"virus alone\", and also to determine whether symptoms were greater for \"bacteria alone\" compared to \"no pathogen detected\". As a control group, we also evaluated the frequency of the same bacteria in nasal wash specimens from healthy adults. Finally, we assessed the relationship between these respiratory pathogens, inflammatory biomarkers and self-reported severity of illness.",

The ARI specimens were obtained from a subset of participants in the NIHsponsored randomized clinical trial, the \"Physician, Echinacea, Placebo (PEP)\" study. 20 A total of 712 nasal wash specimens were obtained from adults at the beginning of an ARI and were tested for viral nucleic acid by multiplex PCR multiplex. 21 Of these, 395 were found to be positive for virus and 317 found to be negative. For this study, 97 specimens per group were randomly selected (www.randomizer.org) from each of 2 groups: those with detectable respiratory viruses and those without detectable respiratory viruses. This sample size was selected based on 2-sided testing, with \u03b1=0.05, power=80%, and hypothesized 20% difference in bacterial detection rates (effect size). The PEP trial spanned from January 2004 to August 2008 and enrolled 719 participants of whom 713 completed the study (one participant had missing viral nucleic acid result). 22 The study rationale and methods have been described previously. 23 Briefly, the pill arm of the PEP trial examined placebo and Echinacea. Participants were eligible if they acknowledged having a cold, had \u22652 points on the Jackson symptom scale 24 and included \u22651 of the following symptoms within 36 hours of enrollment: nasal discharge, obstruction, sneezing or sore-throat. Reasons for exclusion included active symptoms of allergy and asthma observed at enrollment, or use of antibiotics or other excluded medications.",

This assay detects all common respiratory viruses including; rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, and enterovirus. 21 Nasal wash specimens were analyzed for specific bacterial pathogens. DNA was extracted from 300\u03bcl of nasal wash specimens (BiOstic Bacteremia DNA isolation kit, MO BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA). To prevent potential degradation of the bacteria DNA, 0.1mM of EDTA was added to the samples. Quantitative PCR was performed for H. influenza, M. catarrhalis and S. pneumonia. The detection range for each bacterium was from 10 to 1 million colony-forming units (CFU), and the standard curve consisted of DNA extracted from bacteria assayed using the McFarland technique. Multiplex q-PCR employing P6 and copB genes were used for the detection of H. influenza 27 and for M. catarrhalis 28 respectively, and PCR for lytA 29 was conducted separately for detection of S. pneumonia (Table1). All primers and probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA.",

To test the hypothesis that bacterial co-infection during ARI adds to airway inflammation and the severity of illness, we examined the frequency of pathogenic bacteria in nasal wash specimens from healthy adults and adults with ARI. We also included further exploratory analysis based on the presence or absence of detectable respiratory viruses. Overall, bacteria were detected more often during illnesses. Within the ARI group, bacterial detection was significantly greater among samples without detectable viruses compared to samples with viruses. Furthermore, airway inflammation, but not illness severity, was increased with combined presence of bacterial and viral pathogens.

In the virus-negative samples, increased detection of bacteria suggests the possibility that bacteria contribute to illness pathogenesis. This concept is also supported by results of double-blinded randomized controlled trials of antibiotic treatment of ARI, in which beneficial effects were demonstrated in the subgroup of participants with detectable bacteria pathogens. 33, 34 In our analysis, samples that were positive for both bacteria and virus were associated with increased inflammatory changes in nasal secretions, as indicated by greater amounts of CXCL8 and neutrophils. Despite the increase in inflammation associated with detection of viruses plus bacteria, severity of illness was not increased compared to illnesses associated only with a virus. In most studies of ARI, markers of neutrophilic inflammation are positively correlated with symptoms during respiratory illnesses. 7, 11 The lack of correlation between biomarkers and symptoms in our study may be due to the relatively low range in illness severity. In the PEP clinical protocol from which these subjects were selected, the participants needed to have a threshold level of symptoms to meet eligibility criteria. Most illnesses were mild to moderate in severity, and exclusion of asymptomatic infections and the limited number of more severe infections may have obscured relationships between etiology, inflammation, and symptoms of illness.",
