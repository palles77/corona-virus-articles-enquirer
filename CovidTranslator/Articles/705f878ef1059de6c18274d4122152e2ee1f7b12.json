A key enzyme of this replication complex is the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). To study the replication of coronavirus genome, six monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) RdRp were generated and characterized. His-tagged RdRp was expressed in baculovirus, purified and used as immunogen to produce mAbs. The TGEV RdRp was recognized by these mAbs in the context of virus infection by immunofluorescence analysis and Western blot. Epitope mapping by Pepscan indicated that RdRp mAbs recognized four nonoverlapping linear epitopes located in a 62-amino acid region of the N-terminal domain, suggesting that this region may constitute an immunodominant domain. The availability of TGEV RdRp mAbs will be instrumental to study coronavirus replication and to analyze the function of RdRp in pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an enveloped, single-strand positive sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus \u2423 of the Coronaviridae family within the Nidovirales order (de Groot et al., 2010; Enjuanes et al., 2008 ) (see http://talk.ictvonline.org/media/g/vertebrate-2008/default.aspx for official coronavirus taxonomy). Coronavirus (CoV) infections cause a variety of enteric and respiratory diseases relevant in animal and human health, being of special interest the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans (Drosten et al., 2003; Perlman et al., 2000) . The CoV genome is about 30 kb in length, the largest RNA virus genome known (Enjuanes et al., 2008; Masters, 2006) . The 5 two-thirds of the genome contain the replicase gene that is made up of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF 1a and ORF 1b, the latter being translated by a ribosomal frameshift mechanism (Brierley et al., 1987 (Brierley et al., , 1989 . Both ORFs are translated into two co-amino-terminal polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are cleaved autoproteolitically into up to 16 mature products (nsp1-nsp16) that form the replication-transcription complex, probably together with the participation of cellular factors (Enjuanes et al., 2006; Galan et al., 2009; Masters, 2006; Ziebuhr, 2005; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . CoV replication and transcription are complex processes that take place at cytoplasmic double membrane vesicles (DMVs) and involve coordinated processes of both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis (Gosert et al., 2002; Knoops et al., 2008; Masters, 2006; Snijder et al., 2006; Zu\u00f1iga et al., 2004) .",

In addition to the monomeric form, the antibody specifically recognized higher molecular weight polypeptides that might represent either RdRp oligomers or pp1ab polyprotein processing precursors (Fig. 3A , left panel). Similar results, with a slightly higher background, were obtained with mAbs 2C11, 3C12 and 3F9 (Fig. 3A , middle panel). In the case of mAbs 5H1 and 2B5 no binding was detected (Table 1) , most likely due to the low titer of both antibodies and the low expression level of RdRp during infection, compared with the expression level of other viral proteins, such as the N protein (Fig. 3A, right panel) .",

To increase the accessibility of the antigen, cells were fixed and permeabilized with methanol. Under these conditions, a specific and stronger staining was detected in infected cells with all RdRp mAbs. Among these, mAbs 2C11 and 3C12 provided the highest signal (Fig. 3B , lower panels and Table 1 ).

In the first step, the RdRp was subdivided into 4 overlapping fragments (F1-F4) of around 250 aa according to the predicted RdRp domains (Fig. 4A) . The coding sequence of the four fragments was obtained by PCR using specific primers (Table 2) . These fragments were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA-3.1(\u2212), expressed using an in vitro transcription/translation system, and the binding of the mAbs to the RdRp fragments was analyzed by Western blot. All six RdRp specific mAbs recognized the fragment F1 that contains the first 263 aa of the RdRp (Fig. 4A) . Interestingly, computer analysis of the RdRp sequence, using the DNASTAR software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, USA), showed that fragment F1 had the highest surface probability and antigenic index values of the entire RdRp (data not show). In the second step, the specific epitopes were identified by Pepscan analysis of the RdRp fragment F1. To this end, a synthetic peptide array containing 146 peptides of 10 aa each, overlapping in 8 residues, was generated using the SPOT-synthesis method (Frank, 2002) and probed with the RdRp mAbs by immunobloting. Four linear epitopes located in a 62 aa region from residues 97-158 were identified (Fig. 4B) . The epitope sequences were 97-DFFTYK-102 for 2C11 and 3C12, 117-TKYTMM-122 for 4D10, 125-CYAIRN-130 for 5H1, and 153-FFENKD-158 for 3F9 and 2B5. These data suggest that the RdRp N-terminal region covering residues 97 to 158 may constitute an immunodominant domain.",

The position in the array and the sequence of the peptides recognized by the mAbs are indicated. The deduced epitope sequence for each mAb is shown in black boxes. this region constitutes an immunodominant domain. These epitopes are conserved among TGEV related members of the CoV genus \u2423, such as the canine and feline CoVs (CCoV and FCoV) (Fig. 5) . Interestingly, the epitope recognized by the mAb 4D10 is highly conserved in the majority of CoVs from genus \u2423, in infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) from genus \u2425, and in SARS-CoV from genus \u2424 (Fig. 5) . In fact, the mAb 4D10 recognized the SARS-CoV RdRp by Western blot (data not shown), indicating that this mAb, at least, may be used to identify the RdRp of other CoVs. Although polyclonal antibodies recognizing the RdRp of genus \u2424-belonging SARS-CoV and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have been described previously (Prentice et al., 2004; Shi et al., 1999) , this is the first time that mAbs recognizing the RdRp from CoVs of genus \u2423 have been generated and their epitopes identified.
