In the MACS cohort the adjusted odds ratio for bacterial pneumonia compared with HIV-uninfected individuals has declined from 21.8 in the pre-ART period to 4.14 following the introduction of ART [6\u2022\u2022] . The WIHS cohort of HIV-infected women have also shown an elevated incidence of pneumonia despite ART use with an adjusted odds ratio of 9.55 compared with HIV-uninfected controls. Similarly, in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (which involved a virtual cohort of 33,420 HIV-infected individuals using data from the US National VA Health Information System from the date of HIV diagnosis until 2007) a rate of 28 per 1,000 person-years was found in HIV-infected individuals compared with 5.8 per 1,000 person-years in HIVnegative controls [7\u2022\u2022] . A lower incidence has been seen in the EuroSIDA study of more than 18,000 patients in 34 countries studied between 2006 and 2011, in which an incidence of pneumonia of 5.36/1000 person-years was found [8\u2022\u2022] . This may reflect the better immune status of participants in the latter era, who had a mean blood CD4+ count of 457 cells/\u03bcL, as very low levels of severe bacterial infections were demonstrated in the EuroSIDA study in those with CD4 counts above 500 cells/\u03bcL (a level generally regarded as near normal).",

However, the general improvement in incidence rates has not been found in all populations, as surveillance data from Soweto, South Africa, indicate persisting high rates of invasive pneumococcal disease, with no decrease since the introduction of ART [10] . This may be due to the high levels of immunocompromise in this population despite the availability of ART, although an increase in invasive pneumococcal disease was found amongst women in that study, suggesting that general uptake of the childhood pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV; which now forms part of the childhood immunization schedule in South Africa) may be particularly effective at reducing rates of invasive pneumococcal disease amongst HIV-infected adults in this community.",

Cohen et al. have reported an excess mortality amongst HIV-infected persons during influenza epidemic periods in South Africa and the US, with reductions in this excess mortality since the widespread use of ART in the US [43] . However, it is not clear if this excess mortality arises directly from influenza infectionfor example, an observational study in Barcelona found no difference in the severity of influenza in patients with and without HIV infection admitted with influenza H 1 N 1 [44] . The excess deaths in influenza epidemic periods found by Cohen et al. may instead be the result of other conditions which are more prevalent at these times, including pneumococcal pneumonia. In general, data from the H 1 N 1 pandemic of 2009 do not support the suggestion that HIV-infected individuals experience more severe disease [45, 46] . Emerging respiratory pathogens such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) may pose a threat to everybody.

Two forms of pneumococcal vaccination, the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV-23) and PCV have been developed. PPV-23 has been studied in one randomized trial and 15 observational studies, which are the subject of a recent systematic review [64\u2022\u2022] . This concluded that the current evidence base lends only moderate support for the efficacy of the PPV immunization. The only randomized trial was carried out in Africa in a population without widespread access to ART and with a high mortality rate, and found an increased rate of pneumonia in the immunized group. However, these results may not be applicable to a population with access to ART and lower background rates of pneumococcal pneumonia, and most observational studies have shown that PPV-23 immunization is associated with a reduced rate of pneumococcal disease, although in many studies confounding factors that could have influenced this observation were not completely accounted for.",

PCV has theoretical advantages in that it induces T celldependent immune responses and has been demonstrated to be immunogenic in HIV-infected adults in several studies [66] .

These changes in pneumococcal epidemiology following routine childhood immunization have also been observed in other populations, with an 81 % reduction in invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine serotypes in Spain [69] . However, this study also noted an increase in severity and need for mechanical ventilation for pneumococcal pneumonia.

There appeared to be reductions in nonvaccine pneumococcal serotypes which were not restricted to HIV-infected individuals [70] . Analysis of data from England and Wales since the introduction of childhood PCV-7 immunization suggests that there has been a 54 % reduction in invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the serotypes targeted by the vaccine [26\u2022\u2022] .

She was initially treated with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, which resulted in symptomatic improvement. Tests on admission demonstrated HIV-1 infection, with a CD4 count of 192 cells/\u03bcL. a Chest radiograph demonstrates right-sided middle and lower zone consolidation. b CT image of the thorax demonstrates nodular shadowing in both upper lobes, with dense consolidation of the right middle and lower lobes. Sputum microscopy was 3+ positive for acid-fast bacilli and culture confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This emphasizes the importance of testing for HIV and mycobacterial disease in patients with community-acquired pneumonia",
