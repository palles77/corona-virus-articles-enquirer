            "text": "To warrant potential clinical testing, the equine anti-SARS-CoV F(ab\u2032) 2 requires evaluation in as many animal models as possible and a safety test in a primate model. In this study, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics, tolerance and immunity of this kind of antibody in macaques and rats. Results showed that the F(ab\u2032) 2 fragments had a normal metabolism in injected animals. The general physiological indexes did not differ between animals injected with anti-SARS-CoV F(ab\u2032) 2 or saline. However, a mild inflammatory response in local injection site and a moderate immune response against this antibody in the successively injected animals were observed, which however recovered 3 weeks after the last injection. The antibody titring from 1:100 to 400 against the equine anti-SARS-CoV F(ab\u2032) 2 in the inoculated hosts could be detected at week 2 during the successive injections of the equine F(ab\u2032) 2 . The considerable safety of this antibody used in primates and the fact that the immune system of the host can be motivated by post-injection of the F(ab\u2032) 2 indicate that this type of anti-SARS-CoV antibody can be used for prevention and treatment of SASR, especially at the early stage of this virus infection. In addition, it can also provide the precious time for the combined use of other anti-SARS-CoV agents such as antiviral drug and vaccine.",

            "text": "However, the possibility that heterogeneous antibody might evoke a strong host immune response may inhibit its application in a clinical setting. Thus, development of human or humanized antibody against SARS-CoV is theoretically the ideal strategy to prevent infection, as it would be recognized as a 'self' component by human hosts and would not elicit an immune response in the host. For this reason and other considerations such as the difficulty of finding immune human donors and the risk related to the use of human blood products, human and humanized monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV components had been developed and have exhibited effectively preventive roles against SARS-CoV infection in vitro and in vivo [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Nevertheless, the major obstacle for the application of these mAbs in the clinic is the yield of mAb products. However, the heterologous antibodies, for example, equine IgGs, have an advantage in this respect. Furthermore, one theoretically potential advantage of the polyclonal IgGs is the broader antigenic coverage and the lower likelihood of emergence of escape mutants, although this theoretical advantage of the equine anti-SARS-CoV F(ab\u2032) 2 has not been studied here. In addition, the heterology of specific IgGs can be decreased through the preparation of F(ab\u2032) 2 fragments by cutting off the Fc fragment, thus F(ab\u2032) 2 should have higher specific neutralizing activity than complete IgG molecules, which means a smaller quantity of F(ab\u2032) 2 would be needed to neutralize the virus and this would reduce the possibility of an immune response against the F(ab\u2032) 2 , although skin testing for hypersensitivity and possible desensitization [8] may be still necessary in practice.",

All general physiological indexes have no significant difference in successively injected animals from the control, suggesting the good tolerance of the animals to this agent. However, we have really observed the local pathological changes in the injected sites and in the spleens and lymph nodes of the hosts. We have observed that 9 of 12 animals injected with equine anti-SARS-CoV F(ab\u2032) 2 show mild inflammatory response in the local sites of injection. The weight of spleens and lymph nodes from injected animals increased moderately compared with controls. The morphological observation indicate that there are moderate immune responses in the spleens and lymph nodes of the injected animals against the administered equine anti-SARS-CoV F(ab\u2032) 2 fragments. However, all the morphological changes in the secondary immune organs related with the injection of the F(ab\u2032) 2 disappeared after a 3-week recovery from the last injection. The morphological data indicate the hosts can tolerate the successive injection of the F(ab\u2032) 2 . Corresponding with the morphological changes in lymph organs after successive injection of the F(ab\u2032) 2 , the antibody against the injected equine F(ab\u2032) 2 can be detected in all the experimental animals at week 2 postsuccessive injection and even can be detected at week 7 (3-week recovery from the 4-week successive injection everyday). These data indicate that the heterogenous antibody can indeed elicit the immune response in inoculated hosts. Nevertheless, no experimental animals died of the antibody injection and the motivated host secondary lymphoid organs, the spleen and lymph nodes, recovered 3 weeks after the last injection, indicating the good tolerance of the host against this antibody injection. In addition, because the host anti-F(ab\u2032) 2 antibody appears 2 weeks after F(ab\u2032) 2 administration, there is enough time for the equine antibody to exert a protective effect at the early stage of SARS-CoV infection, as shown in our previous studies with this type of antibody in several animal models [17] [18] [19] [20] , thus producing a marked effect during a large-scale SARS outbreak, or providing enough time for the combined application of other anti-SARS-CoV agents, such as antiviral drug, vaccines and so on.",
