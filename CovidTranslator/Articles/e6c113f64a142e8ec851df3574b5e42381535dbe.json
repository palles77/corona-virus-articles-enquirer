Since the 1960s, there has been a steady increase in the use of NIR spectroscopy, with the most dramatic growth in the last 25 years. NIR spectroscopy is characterized by low molar absorptivity and scattering. In the beginning, the NIR region was regarded as having little potential for analytical work.

In NIR spectroscopy, excitation of molecules is accomplished in a wavelength range between 750 and 2500 nm ( Figure 22 .1), corresponding to a wavenumber range between 4.000 and 13.000/cm [8] . CeH, CeO, C]O, NeH, and OeH functional groups are excited to perform stretching-, deformation-and scissor-vibrations. In comparison to the MIR region, where only fundamental vibrations (\"signatures\") can be observed, overtones and combinations can be found in the NIR region containing a manifold of information compared to MIR [9] . The result is often a crowded spectrum with overlapping peaks. Although NIR-intensities are 10 to1000 times lower than for MIR, highly sensitive spectrometers can be built through several means including the use of efficient detectors. The light recorded by the detector contains compositional information, which can be unraveled by a computer to report multiple analyses almost instantaneously. NIR spectroscopy can provide simultaneous, rapid, and nondestructive qualitative and quantitative analysis of major components in many organic substances [10] .",

Spectrophotometers are conveniently classified into dispersive and nondispersive instruments. For example, in a dispersive filter instrument, the monochromator is a wheel holding a number of absorption or interference filters, with the disadvantage of limited resolution [11] . In a scanning monochromator instrument, a grating or a prism is used to separate the individual frequencies of the radiation. In Fourier transform (FT) spectrophotometers, interferometers are used to generate modulated light, and time domain signal of the light reflected or transmitted by the sample can be converted into a spectrum ",

In FTIR microscopy, one can choose between two different sampling techniques: transmission (IR beam passes through the sample) and reflection (IR beam reflects from the sample surface). In transmission measurements, the IR beam passes through the sample and the transmitted light is recorded by a detector, which is placed behind the sample following the law of LamberteBeer. Transmission analysis requires the sample to be partly transparent. Samples can be placed on substrates transparent to the wavelength range of the probing radiation (e.g., MIR) such as calcium fluoride (CaF 2 ), barium fluoride (BaF 2 ) or zinc selenide (ZnSe) [18] .",

Chen and coworkers compared the three algorithms partial least square (PLS), interval PLS (iPLS), and synergy interval PLS (siPLS) to predict the total polyphenol content [29] . The siPLS model performed best, with an RMSEP of 0.7327 (range: 15.84e24.39%) using five PLS factors. The same work group reported PLS calibrations to determine the contents of the main catechins. Using 75 samples, EGC (0.14%, range: 2.4e5.4%), EC (0.017%, range: 0.1e0.4%), epigallocatechingallate (EGCG) (0.38%, range: 7.7e14.1%), and epicatechingallate (ECG) (0.12%, range: 1.8e3.7%) were calibrated using 10e14 PLS factors. Luypaert et al. [30] reported on a NIR spectroscopy method in combination with PLS algorithms to predict caffeine, EGCG, EC, and total antioxidant capacity. Zhang and coworkers [31] predict the total antioxidant capacity in green tea using PCR regression with test set validation, with 100 samples in the calibration set and 23 in the validation set.",

The ability of the two spectroscopic techniques to replace the five assays was evaluated and compared. In general, NIR demonstrated advantages over ATR-IR spectroscopy, and had the best results for the ABTS assay (R 2 : 0.94, RPD corr : 4.66; test set validation). Also, ATR-IR spectroscopy revealed the best prediction power for the ABTS assay (R 2 : 0.94, RPD corr : 4.10; test set validation).

The pharmacological mechanism by which this extract works as an antidepressant is still not discovered. Both hypericin and hyperforin play an important role as standards in the phytopharmaceutical industry. For the investigation of St. John's Wort and its ingredients, different analytical procedures have been established, including IR imaging spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy, TLC, LC, LC coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and CE. Prior to spectroscopic analysis via NIR spectroscopy, a reference method based on LC, LC-MS, and CE was established [40] . In the following, 320 spectra of 80 extracts were recorded in transflection mode using light fiber optics over a wavelength range from 4008 to 9996/cm with a resolution of 12/cm at 23 C and an optical pathway of 1 mm. The most intensive band in the first derivative spectrum belonged to the vibration of the second overtone of the carbonyl group (5352/cm), followed by CeH stretch and CeH deformation vibration, the eOH vibration (4440/cm) and the eCH 2 overtone (5742/cm). Five primary factors were necessary to reach the best calibration equation. The robustness of the established NIR spectroscopy model is high, which is demonstrated in the similarity of results for SEE and SEP: 0.52 and 0.50 mg m/L and 0.64 and 0.71 mg m/L for hypericin and hyperforin, respectively (Table 22 .1).",

An approach to understanding the function and the biochemical composition of plant tissue is one aim of imaging studies. IR spectroscopic imaging and mapping technologies have proven to be powerful options for generating new information on plant tissue compositions and alterations. The use of FTIR imaging to evaluate differences in the chemical composition of the Urtica dioica root tissue was described by Pallua et al. [64] . Tissue specimens were cut on a microtome at 5-mm thickness and mounted onto CaF 2 -slides. FTIR microscopic measurements were performed on an FTIR microscope equipped with a liquid nitrogencooled MCT 16-element linear array detector at atmospheric conditions. The samples were measured in MIR transmission mode with a nominal lateral resolution of 25 \u00c2 25 mm per pixel for each spot. Absorbance spectra were recorded in the range from 4.000/ cm to 750/cm with a spectral resolution of 4/cm with two co-added scans at 1.0 cm/s step size. After measurement, the samples were analyzed by spectra, univariate, and cluster analyses. The analyses were performed using Spectrum software (PerkinElmer, England), Spectrum IMAGE software (PerkinElmer, England) and CytoSpec software package (http://www. cytospec.com, Germany). For the interpretation and calibration of the system, the FTIR-images were correlated with the histomorphological information. With this method, it was shown that it is possible to image different types of ingredients in the root applying a resolution of 25 \u00c2 25 mm.",

The optical image shows different tissue types: plerom tissue, periblem tissue, and rhizoderm tissue. The chemical map of the absorption at 1662e1645/cm, which is commonly attributed to amid-I proteins, represents a homogeneous distribution in all tissue types. This FTIR imaging result clearly demonstrated a very high absorption of this band in the periblem and rhizodermis region, and indicates that these tissue types produce a high amount of amid-II proteins. A chemical map was generated by integrating the area under the band absorption at 1138e988/cm, which is commonly attributed to carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and phospholipids. The chemical map of the absorption at 1160e1140/cm correlated well with the morphology of the plerom region, and indicates that this tissue type produces a high amount of the mentioned ingredients. These observations led to the fact that the plerom tissue produces a high amount of carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and phospholipids compared to periblem or rhizoderm tissue. However, this form of processing cannot do specific correlations with morphological and histological features. Therefore, different cluster analyses are performed to fully characterize the range of spectral variations through the tissue section. Therefore, FCM and KM clustering are the most appropriate methods of choice.",
