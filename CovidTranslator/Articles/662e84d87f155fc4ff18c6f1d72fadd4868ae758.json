The vast majority of organisms are engulfed and disposed of by the immune system, and an immune response is generated to protect the animal from that organism in the future. Microorganisms cause disease either by overwhelming the host's immune system by the sheer number of organisms invading the body at one time or by evading the host's immune response. Some viruses continually alter their outer proteinaceous coat so that they are unrecognizable by the body as having been there before. Some bacteria generate a mucous layer outside the cell wall that makes it difficult for cells of the immune system to engulf them. Some bacteria grow within a biofilm, a protein and mucous matrix that prevents immune cells from getting to all the bacterial cells. Finally, some microorganisms can grow within the cells of the immune system itself, making them invisible to the body.",

Mechanical protection includes the skin; the flushing action of urine or milk washing ascending invaders back out of the body; and the mucociliary apparatus of the sinuses, nasal passages, and lungs, which captures invaders in mucus and expels them by upward and outward motion of tiny hairs on the surfaces of cells and by eliciting the cough response. Chemical protection includes lysozyme, an enzyme in tears, saliva, milk, and other body fluids; low pH, as in the stomach; and the presence of chemicals that interfere with the growth of microorganisms. Finally, many areas of the body contain a normal complement of bacteria, such as the oral cavity, vagina, and large intestine. In these areas, several species of bacteria live in balance; invaders are unable to colonize because of lack of nutrients or production of chemicals by the normal flora, which discourage growth of other organisms. The specific immune response is the body's attempt to eradicate invaders, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other proteins. These foreign substances may be inhaled, ingested, or introduced by a stab wound or bite; any way an invader can enter the body, it will be recognized by the animal's immune system. The specific object on an invader to which the immune system responds is called an antigen. Most antigens are proteins. Antigen is defined as any material or chemical substance that can elicit a specific immune response.",

Therefore, newborn pups cannot respond well to infection because they do not have circulating antibodies and cannot generate their own antibodies or activate T cells to destroy invading microorganisms directly. Colostrum, the first milk generated by the bitch postpartum, contains many antibodies. The intestinal tract of newborn pups is capable of directly absorbing these very large proteins for only about the first 24 hours of life; after that time, there is a change in the intestinal lining preventing absorption of large molecules and the antibody proteins are broken down and digested.",

            "text": "The frequency with which animals need to be vaccinated to allow them to maintain a protective concentration of antibodies in serum varies with age of the animal, the type of vaccine used, and the animal's responsiveness to the vaccine. At birth, puppies have few circulating antibodies in their bloodstream. Only about 3% of the antibodies they need to protect them from disease cross the placenta and are present at the moment of birth. Antibodies ingested passively in colostrum protect puppies until they can generate their own immune response at about 4 weeks of age. Puppies usually are immunized several times, with a 2-to 4-week interval, to ensure a good immune response. The factors that can prevent a good response are (1) our inability to recognize exactly at what time the animal becomes capable of responding to an antigen introduced by vaccination and (2) the presence of antibody from the dam, which will neutralize antigens introduced with the vaccine. Immunization of puppies is therefore a balancing act in which we try to promote the pup's own immune response without allowing the concentration of antibody derived from the dam to fall so low as to risk the pup being exposed to disease without adequate protection. Because there is no good way to know whether or not a pup has responded to vaccination or whether it still has protection against disease from its dam, it is not recommended to expose pups to strange people or dogs much before vaccination at about 8 weeks of age. For most vaccines, it is recom-mended that pups be immunized at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age. Some people prefer to begin vaccinating their pups at 6 weeks of age; the manufacturer's recommendation always should be followed. The occasional puppy does not respond to vaccination; measurement of antibody concentration in serum 2 weeks after the final vaccination in the series may allow a veterinarian to determine whether the puppy is adequately protected or should receive another vaccination before the annual booster as an adult.",

There is no scientific documentation of this phenomenon. Vaccination failure may occur. This is defined as failure of the animal to generate a protective immune response after immunization (Table 5-1). It is thought that some animals may have a genetic predisposition to vaccination failure; no genetic test for such is available at this time. It is understood that if enough animals are vaccinated, the overall incidence of disease will decline and animal health will improve (\"herd health\").

However, every study varies in its definition of \"adequate,\" and few studies test their definition by exposing the animals to disease and seeing what number get sick. That makes it impossible to draw blood from an individual animal, measure the concentration of antibodies present, and definitively state that the animal is safe from exposure to disease, with the exception of animals that are tested and determined to have no significant antibodies.
