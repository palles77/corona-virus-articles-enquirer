            "text": "Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a highly infectious respiratory pathogen of domestic cats. The prevalence of FCV in the general cat population is high, particularly in multi-cat households, largely because many clinically recovered cats remain persistently infected carriers. In order to assess how FCV circulates in such groups and to assess the contribution that each individual animal makes to the epidemiology of the disease, we have carried out the first detailed analysis of long-term shedding patterns of FCV in individual cats within naturally infected colonies. The prevalence of FCV in each of the groups on individual sampling occasions ranged from 0% to 91%, with averages for the individual colonies ranging from 6% to 75%. Within each of the colonies, one to three distinct strains of FCV were identified. Individual cats showed a spectrum of FCV shedding patterns over the sampling period which broadly grouped into three categories: those that shed virus relatively consistently, those that shed virus intermittently, and those that appeared never to shed virus. This is the first report identifying non-shedder cats that appear resistant to FCV infection over long periods of time, despite being continually exposed to virus. Such resistance appeared to be age related, which may have been immune-mediated, although by analogy with other caliciviruses, factors such as host genetic resistance may play a role. Given that a proportion of the population appears to be resistant to infection, clearly the cohort of cats that consistently shed virus are likely to provide an important mechanism whereby infection can be maintained in small populations. #",

The duration of this carrier state is variable, ranging in individual animals from months to years (Gaskell et al., 1982; Povey et al., 1973; Wardley, 1976; Wardley and Povey, 1977a) . Povey et al. (1973) arbitrarily defined the FCV carrier state as an animal excreting virus for a minimum of 30 days post infection. Some experimental studies have shown that most cats are shedding virus at 30 days post infection, but by 75 days only about 50% of these are still persistently infected (Gaskell et al., 1982; Wardley and Povey, 1977a) . The decline in the proportion of cats shedding virus appears to be exponential, with only a minority of animals becoming long-term carriers. In other experimental studies however, the carrier state has been less easily established, suggesting various host or virus factors may also play a role (Knowles et al., 1991; Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995) .",

Such carriers have been defined as high, medium or low-level shedders, according to the mean titre of virus recovered from the oropharynx (Wardley, 1976) . High-level carriers are easily detectable and are thought to be of considerable risk to susceptible cats. In contrast, low-level carriers may be more difficult to detect and a series of swabs may be required to detect shedding over the minimum 30-day period defined for FCV carriers (Povey et al., 1973) .",

Such figures are broadly similar to those found in prevalence studies carried out in healthy cats prior to the introduction of vaccination (Wardley et al., 1974) , and support the finding that vaccination does not prevent infection or the development of the carrier state Gaskell et al., 1982 Gaskell et al., , 2004b Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995) . In general, most of the infected animals in such studies are thought to be persistently infected carriers, although it has been recognised that some may be cats undergoing reinfection, or subclinical infection with an avirulent strain (Wardley et al., 1974) .",

In order to address this, an indepth longitudinal study of FCV prevalence and viral shedding patterns in five naturally infected cat colonies over a 15-46-month period was carried out.

Each colony appeared to be infected with between one and three distinct strains, on the basis of previous reports where distinct strains of FCV appear to be separated by uncorrected nucleotide distances of >20% in hypervariable region E of the FCV capsid gene (Radford et al., 1997 (Radford et al., , 2000 (Radford et al., , 2003 ; a range of variability was also seen within a strain (Coyne, 2005) . Thus colony A contained two strains, A1 and A2; colony B three strains, B1, B2 and B3; colony C one strain, C1; colony D two strains, D1 and D2; colony E two strains, E1 and E2. The shedding patterns of each of these strains by individual cats are shown in Table 3a -e. Interestingly, in colony E, one cat appeared to be infected with a virus similar to that present in the live-attenuated vaccine used in the colony (cat 2, colony E, strain E1). Not all isolates were sequenced successfully, and it is possible that other strains were present in some cats/colonies which may not have been detected by the primers used. Such PCR failure has been reported in other studies with FCV as well as for other caliciviruses (Green et al., 1995; Radford et al., 2001b) . Of the cats that were classified as consistent shedders, 59% (13/22) appeared to be infected with only one strain of virus during the course of the study (e.g. Table 3d , cat 2), whilst 23% (5/22) shed two different strains (e.g. Table 3d , cat 3). A similar pattern was also observed with the group of cats that were classified as intermittent shedders; 65% (30/46) shed the same strain of FCV during the study period (e.g. Table 3d , cat 10) and 15% (7/46) shed more than one strain (e.g. Table 3d , cat 13). Thus both groups (consistent and intermittent shedders) appear to contain a mixture of animals, with some consistently shedding the same virus strain, and others undergoing re-infection with a different strain. Co-infection of Table 3 (a-e) FCV viral shedding and strain patterns of individual cats within each of the five colonies In each colony cats are broadly divided into three groups, consistent shedders (C) positive on !75% occasions; intermittent shedders (I) positive on <75% occasions; non-shedders (N) never positive for FCV. For all colonies coloured squares represent FCV isolated, viral strain identified and viral titre (expressed as log 10 TCID 50 per 0.1 ml sample); empty square (&) represents no FCV isolated; grey square ( ) represents FCV isolated but no strain information available; grey square ( ) represents mixed FCV infection with two distinct viral strains; ns indicates that cat was not sampled; * Indicates cat was not part of the colony at the time of sampling; na represents cat was FCV positive but viral titre was not available; a FeHV-1 isolated. For individual colonies: (3a) Colony A, black square ( ) is strain A1 and orange square ( ) is strain A2; (3b) Colony B, brown square ( ) is strain B1, green square ( ) is strain B2, and blue square ( ) is strain B3; (3c) Colony C, purple square ( ) is strain C1; (3d) Colony D, red square ( ) is strain D1, and blue square ( ) is strain D2, recombinant virus is cat 24; (3e) Colony E, pink square ( ) is strain E1 and yellow square ( ) is strain E2. more than one distinct FCV strain was detected in two individual cats (cat 5, colony B; cat 1, colony D).

Virus was also present in each of the colonies despite active vaccination. Such variation in prevalence may be influenced by a number of host, population, management and viral factors, including, for example, the level of pre-existing immunity within the cats.

These distinctions are descriptive rather than absolute as a number of factors including sampling protocol may influence the results for an individual cat. Whether or not the cat that appears negative either on some or all occasions are truly negative, or whether it is a sampling artefact, is not clear. Nevertheless it does seem likely that animals vary in their sensitivity to FCV infection despite being in the same colony with similar exposure factors. This is clearly demonstrated by three adult cats in colony D that were siblings (cats 2 and 4, both consistent shedders, and cat 27, an intermittent shedder). Interestingly, similar spectrums of viral shedding patterns have been reported previously for feline coronavirus infections in cats (Addie and Jarrett, 2001; Foley et al., 1997) .",

Identifying such cats would be crucial to eliminating virus from infected colonies. Why some animals appear to shed virus more consistently than others is not clear. There are a number of possible reasons, apart from the sampling procedure, that may account for this. For example, Wardley (1976) suggested that intermittent shedders may shed lower levels of virus, which sometimes fall below the sensitivity of the cell culture test, rather than truly fluctuating between a positive and negative state. However, in our study there was no significant difference in mean viral titres between the consistent and intermittent shedder groups. In addition, viral shedding patterns did not appear to be influenced by whether individual cats were infected with the same strain of virus over time, or were undergoing reinfection with a different strain.",

This present study confirmed such findings in that each colony appeared to be infected with between one and three distinct strains of virus. It is possible that other strains were also present in some colonies, as not all isolates were amplifiable on PCR, possibly because of sequence variability particularly in the hypervariable region E of the FCV capsid region of the genome used for PCR (Neill, 1992; Radford et al., 2001b; Seal et al., 1993) . Interestingly, one of the strains identified in colony E appeared to be the vaccine strain F9. This colony was known to use live F9-based vaccine, resulting in the possibility that F9 virus may have become established in the colony from the vaccine. Virus closely related to vaccine strain F9 has also been reported in other groups of cats (Horimoto et al., 2001; Radford et al., 2001a) .",

As a consequence the emergence of distinct viral populations may occur, contributing to viral persistence.

Such resistance to infection may be as a result of genetic or acquired immunity. For human caliciviruses (noroviruses), resistance/susceptibility of an individual to infection with a given strain is associated with variability in the expression of surface carbohydrates belonging to the ABH histo-blood group antigens, which are used by the virus for cell attachment (Harrington et al., 2004; Hutson et al., 2003; Lindesmith et al., 2003) .

The study shows that FCV can remain at a relatively high prevalence in colonies of cats over long periods of time, despite widespread use of vaccination. The observed high prevalence is maintained by large numbers of generally asymptomatically infected cats in colonies where a small number of distinct FCV strains are circulating. A spectrum of FCV shedding patterns were identified with cats broadly grouping into three categories; consistent shedders, intermittent shedders and non-shedders. The basis of the apparent resistance of the non-shedders remains to be determined, but may either be immune-mediated, or possibly host receptor driven.",
