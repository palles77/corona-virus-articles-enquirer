The shedding of PRCV/TGEV was studied at different days post-arrival in fecal and nasal swabs from PRCV/TGEV seronegative sentinel pigs introduced into a PRCV seropositive herd with questionable TGEV serology and diarrhea. Nasal shedding of PRCV was detected in 57% and 63% of samples by nested-RT-PCR and cell culture immunofluorescence (CCIF), respectively. However fecal shedding of PRCV was detected in 37% of the samples by nested-RT-PCR and 19% by CCIF. Four respiratory and 5 fecal PRCV strains were isolated in swine testicle cells including nasal/fecal PRCV pairs (isolated at the same time) from 3 pigs. Comparison of nasal/fecal PRCV pairs from individual pigs revealed different deletions in the spike (S) gene (648 or 681 nt) in 2 pairs and a consistent change in nt 790/791 (aa T to V) for all pairs. In preliminary studies, inoculation of gnotobiotic pigs with each plaque-purified pair of the nasal and fecal PRCV isolates, revealed no clinical disease but different tropisms. The nasal isolate was shed both nasally and in feces, but the fecal isolate was shed only marginally in feces, and not nasally. Our results show that nested-RT-PCR was as sensitive as CCIF for PRCV detection in nasal swabs, but was more sensitive than CCIF for PRCV detection in fecal samples; alternatively PRCV shed in feces was more labile with loss of infectivity. The S-gene sequence differences found between the fecal and respiratory PRCV isolates may influence their tissue tropism. These new PRCV isolates should be useful to understand the molecular basis of coronavirus tropism and evolution in infected swine. 958 V. Costantini et al.",

Most European PRCVs have an identical deletion of 672 nt in the same position at the 5 end region, suggesting that they were derived from the same precursor [20] . In contrast U.S. PRCV strains, have deletions of various sizes (621-681 nt) located in different positions, suggesting that they originated independently [6] . Because this deletion is present in all independently derived PRCVs, it has been proposed that the size and position of the deletion is related to the differences observed in tissue tropism between PRCV and TGEV [1, 8] . Investigators have suggested that amino acid changes at the N-terminal region of the TGEV S protein also affect the enteric tropism of the PUR46 strain of TGEV [1] .",

However a second region in the S protein (around amino acid 219) also influences the enteric tropism of TGEV [1] . The S protein of TGEV has four major antigenic sites, with site A being the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies and conserved in both TGEV and PRCV strains [5, 19] . The S protein of PRCV is smaller due to the deletion with loss of one or two antigenic sites (C and B or D depending on the nomenclature) in the deletion region [19, 11] . Because most virus neutralization (VN) antibodies are directed to site A, conventional antibody assays fail to differentiate between pigs infected with PRCV or TGEV. Blocking ELISA tests using monoclonal antibodies to antigenic sites in the PRCV deletion region of the S protein (one to conserved site A and a second to deleted site D) are used to serologically differentiate between PRCV and TGEV-infected pigs [17, 23, 24] . Because site A is conserved on TGEV and PRCV, only sera from pigs infected with either virus will contain antibodies to this site and compete with site A MAbs for binding to the viral protein in blocking ELISA. In contrast, because site D is only present on TGEV, but absent on PRCV, sera from pigs infected with TGEV compete with site D MAbs [23, 24] . However, sometimes these tests result in false TGEV positives or borderline reactions that are difficult to interpret making it problematic to accurately define the TGEV status or diagnose TGEV in PRCV infected swine herds [22] .",

Fiftysix percent (17/30) of sentinel pigs seroconverted to PRCV at 28 DPA without respiratory clinical signs. Because investigators have reported that only TGEV has an enteric tropism and causes diarrhea, but the serology suggested the presence of PRCV and was questionable for TGEV, our overall goal was to clarify if pigs were shedding TGEV or PRCV and to determine if the isolates were similar or identical to each other and to previously described TGEV or PRCV strains.",

No shedding of TGEV was detected by nested-RT-PCR. Nasal shedding of PRCV/TGEV was detected in 63% of the samples by CCIF and 57% of the samples were PRCV positive by nested-RT-PCR. The nested-RT-PCR was as sensitive as CCIF to detect PRCV and there was a good agreement between both techniques, with the peak of PRCV nasal shedding at 19 DPA (1 day after diarrhea). However the detection of PRCV in fecal swabs showed different results. The nested-RT-PCR was more sensitive than CCIF for PRCV detection in fecal samples (37% and 19%, respectively, Fig. 1 ). The peak of PRCV fecal shedding was at 19 DPA by nested-RT-PCR (57%) but only 14.3% of the fecal samples were positive by CCIF. Previous reports showed that nested-RT-PCR is more sensitive than CCIF for detection of rectal shedding of TGEV. In a study by Kim et al. [10] , gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated with the cell culture adapted TGEV strain BW021898B or the original field pig intestinal content sample. Viral shedding was detected in rectal swabs from DPI 1 until 4 by nested-RT-PCR, but only at 1 DPI using CCIF [10] . It is also possible that intestinal antibodies to PRCV, present in the intestinal contents of the PRCV seropositive pigs could interfere with the detection of fecal shedding of PRCV by CCIF, but not by the nested-RT-PCR assays. In addition, it is possible that PRCV is more labile in feces or particles may lose their spike protein [17] resulting in loss of infectivity detected by CCIF assays, but not the RNA in these viral particles, detected in nested-RT-PCR assays.",

            "text": "The PRCV has a different tissue tropism from that of TGEV. The TGEV replicates in both respiratory and intestinal epithelial cells and causes gastroenteritis, whereas PRCV replicates to high titers in the upper respiratory tract and lung tissue of swine [13, 17] . However, PRCV strain AR310 was the first PRCV strain isolated from the small intestine of a field pig from an Arkansas, U.S. swine herd [27] . Cox et al., 1990 , reported the isolation of PRCV strain TLM83 from various tissues including the intestine of hysterectomy-derived colostrumdeprived pigs which were inoculated by aerosol with 10 7 TCID50 PRCV at six days of age. Virus was consistently isolated in highest titers from respiratory tract tissues, but also from stomach, small intestine and colon. However none of the pigs showed respiratory signs or diarrhea [4] . Their results showed that PRCV infected only a few unidentified cells at villous or crypt sites in the small intestinal mucosa and spread from the ileum to the duodenum. Although unclear, the authors suggested that the aerosol inoculation of pigs with TLM83 caused a respiratory infection followed by viremia and ingestion of PRCV to infect the intestinal cells. In our studies the detection of PRCV from nasal swabs of gnotobiotic pigs GP 10-6 and 10-7 inoculated with the respiratory 12-19N PRCV isolate confirms the respiratory tropism, but the presence of fecal shedding in both pigs in the absence of villous atrophy (GP 10-6) also suggests an intestinal infection like that reported for PRCV strain TLM83 [4] . However, when a gnotobiotic pig (GP was oronasally inoculated with the fecal 12-19F PRCV isolate (isolated from the fecal swab fluids of the same sentinel pig as 12-19N) and a second gnotobiotic pig (GP 10-9) was inoculated with the fecal PRCV strain recovered from GP 10-6 (originally inoculated with the respiratory strain 12-19N), virus shedding was detected only in rectal swab fluids. Because the virus was inoculated by both the oral and nasal routes and detected only from rectal swab fluids and not from nasal swab fluids, the positive signal was unlikely to be derived from the virus inoculum. The histopathology results showed normal length villi in the small intestine of GP 10-8, but slightly shortened villi in the ileum of GP 10-9. These collective results suggest that the detection of PRCV in the rectal swab fluids from the gnotobiotic pigs inoculated with 12-19N, is not just the consequence of a respiratory infection followed by ingestion of PRCV with shedding of ingested virus in feces, but another factor may exists to account for the change in tropism of these PRCV strains. Failure to detect villous atrophy or PRCV antigen in the small intestine of GP10-6 given 12-19N PRCV may have been due to the later time that this pig was euthanized (7DPI) versus pigs GP 10-8 and GP 10-9 that were euthanized at 4 DPI. However because no clinical signs were evident it was difficult to establish optimal times to euthanize these pigs for antigen or lesion detection. Failure to detect PRCV antigen by IFA in the intestinal tissue of any of these pigs may have been due to the timing, the presence of too few infected cells for detection or to use of impression smears which may not adequately reflect cells in the crypt regions or in the intestinal submucosal region. Alternatively failure to detect fecal shedding of PRCV in these pigs by CCIF may reflect a lower sensitivity of this assay or the lability of PRCV strains in feces.",

Four respiratory [7-19N * 1(2) 7-23N * 2(1) 12-19N * 3(1), 16-19N * 2(1)] and 5 fecal [7-19F * 1(1), 12-19F * 2(1), 16-19F * 2(1), 14-23F * 1(1), 24-23F * 3(1)] strains were isolated and plaque-purified in ST cells and the S-gene was partially sequenced. All U.S. PRCV strains reported in the literature have 621-681 nt deletions within the 5 region of the S-gene resulting in loss of 1 or 2 antigenic sites [13, 19] . In contrast TGEV strains have an intact S-gene. Sequence analysis allowed grouping of the 9 isolates into 3 groups according to the size and position of the S-gene deleted. The deletion size ranged between 648 to 681 nt, starting at nt 58, 64 or 106 to nt 732, 744 and 753. The sequences were aligned by the Clustal method and the analysis showed a high homology between the PRCV isolates and the other U.S. strains of PRCV.",

Analysis of the tropism of TGEV recombinant isolates have demonstrated that nucleotide changes of the S gene that result in amino acid changes at the N-terminal region of the TGEV S protein also affect the enteric tropism of TGEV. Because of this observation, we focused on analysis of this region [1] .",
