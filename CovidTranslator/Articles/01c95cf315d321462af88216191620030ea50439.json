The variability of the 5' end of NS 1 protein gene in the genome is confirmed by comparison with previously determined DNA sequences. A 15 nucleotide deletion was also observed in this vaccine strain. In order to improve CPV diagnosis, radioactively labelled RNA or DNA and biotin labelled DNA obtained by random priming of the recombinant plasmid were used as probes mainly on gut or stool samples from naturally infected dogs. Results of filter hybridization correlated well with histopathological diagnosis of parvovirus infection and with hemagglutination tests performed on dog faeces. We propose that nucleic acid hybridization may be an alternative diagnostic method to ascertain the presence of CPV, especially in frozen samples.",

            "text": "Comparison of this sequence with that of three other CPV strains [27, 30, 32] and one FPLV strain [20] revealed point mutations between the different isolates (Table 1) . Furthermore, a 15 nucleotides deletion, located in the NS 1 gene, and extending from nucleotide 2040 to nucleotide 2056 of the Norden CPVs strain (CPV-N) sequence [30] was observed in the cloned DNA. To elucidate whether the deletion observed was originally in the vaccine or was generated by cell culture passages in our laboratory, DNA sequence was determined on CPV-b 108 after PCR amplification of a 1000 bp fragment including the deleted region and the two H i n d I I I restriction sites (Fig. 1) . PCR amplification products were then cleaved with Hind III, cloned in pT7T 318U and sequenced. The presence of the deletion in the original vaccine was thus confirmed. Consequently, the modified NS 1 gene did not alter viral replication in cell culture as CPV-b 108 could be multiplied without loss of infectivity. Application of 32p labelled DNA or RNA probe for routine diagnosis DNA from various organs of dogs and cats was extracted, spotted onto nitrocellulose and assayed with probes. Samples came from animals which died of parvovirus infection as could be deduced from histological examinations, expected for three of them which were classified as \"suspect\"and one gut sample taken from a puppy suffering from distemper which was chosen as a negative control. Out of 15 gut samples from diseased dogs, 13 were positive with DNA or RNA probes. Two spleen extracts were tested: only one hybridized. Four faecal extracts which showed specific hemagglutinating properties hybridized strongly and the fifth one from a suspect dog was negative. Two samples for panleukopenia diagnosis, one from the gut and the other, a mixture of spleen and kidney, did not hybridize. Results presented with the DNA probe in Fig. 3 were identical with the RNA probe (data not shown).",

Probes for viruses in the family Parvoviridae have only been reported for the human B 19 parvovirus [4, 34] with higher sensitivity in terms of quantity of target DNA detected but the number of infectious particles detected is of the same order. In fact, there is a discrepancy between the number of infectious particles detected (104s CCIDs0) and the quantity of purified DNA spotted and detected: 0.3 ng DNA correspond to 10 s viral particles. This may be explained by the production of defective DNA genomes and/or a greater number of RF copies in the supernatants of infected cell culture which cannot be measured in terms of infectivity. RNA probes have been developped to overcome any background due to hybridization of the plasmid with bacteria present in stools and gut contents but we did not encounter such difficulty. Although RNA probes have been shown to offer up to tenfold more sensitivity than DNA probes, at least on RNA viruses such as enterovirus [15] and on DNA viruses such as B 19 parvovirus [34] , the results obtained in our study did not demonstrate any difference in the sensitivity and specificity of the two types of probes.",
