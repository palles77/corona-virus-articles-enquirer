Healthy infants were included at signs of first respiratory tract infection. Paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal swabs were collected. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out for 11 respiratory pathogens. Paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal swabs were collected in 98 infants. Rhinovirus (n=67) and respiratory syncytial virus (n=39) were the most frequently detected. Co-infection occurred in 48% (n=45) of the infants. The sensitivity of the nasal swab was lower than the nasopharyngeal aspirate, in particular, for respiratory syncytial virus (51% vs. 100%) and rhinovirus (75% vs. 97%). The sensitivity of the nasal swab was strongly determined by the cycle threshold (CT)",

Nucleic acids were extracted using the QIAamp DSP virus kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA).

Each 100-\u03bcl reaction mixture contained 60 \u03bcl cDNA mix and 40 \u03bcl of eluted RNA. After incubation for 10 min at 25\u00b0C, RT was carried out for 30 min at 48\u00b0C, followed by RT inactivation for 5 min at 95\u00b0C [14] .

The major advantage of a swab is that collection is less painful and more convenient than an aspirate, as no additional devices are needed [5] . These factors may outweigh some reduction in sensitivity. The advantage of molecular methods in the detection of respiratory viruses has been reported [26, 27] and Lambert et al. reported that using these methods seemed to overcome the previously observed sensitivity reduction when less invasive specimens were combined with the conventional laboratory methods [7] . With the recently developed flocked swabs, the sensitivity is even further improved and the flocked swabs have the advantage of being rapid and less traumatic for paediatric patients [28] . However, the sensitivity of the flocked swab in outpatient respiratory tract infections may be lower than in hospitalised patients. Further studies are required considering different types of swabs and patient populations, and should test for a broad spectrum of respiratory pathogens.",

Similar results were reported in other studies where conventional, non-amplification-based methods were used [8, 9] . Lambert et al. did not test for rhinovirus and this was the most frequently detected virus in our study and elsewhere [11, 29] . No influenza detections were found in our study. This is not explained by sampling bias, because most swabs were taken during NPA nasopharyngeal aspirate; NS nasal swab; RSV respiratory syncytial virus; CT Cycle threshold value a One-sided 97.5% confidence interval was used in case sensitivity was 100% b The CT-value of the NPA was used as a reference to compare with NS, therefore the sensitivity of the NPA is 100% for all categories the winter season, during which both RSV and influenza had their peak incidence. A possible reason may be related to the patient population and the small population size. Another study showed similar results, with rhinovirus and RSV being the most frequently detected [29] . There were a number of limitations of this study. Firstly, one limitation was the timing of sampling. For five cases, sampling occurred 10 days after the onset of illness. Since the viral shedding of RSV is highest between days 0 and 6, sampling should preferably occur in this period [30] . The high proportion of positive samples, however, indicates that this effect was not a major drawback of this study. Secondly, in this study, pain and discomfort of the collection of the samples was not assessed, but other studies provided reference to this [5] . Finally, it is unknown whether the order of obtaining the specimens may have resulted in a lower detection rate in the NS. It is possible that, by suctioning both nostrils for the NPA, the secretions with virus or viral nucleic acids were reduced. This corresponds with the finding that few mild cases were detected with the NS, as the sensitivity of the NS dropped with lower symptoms score and higher CT values. Because the order and nature of the sample collection was slightly different from the study performed by Lambert et al., the sensitivity of the NS may be an underestimate, and caution needs to be taken when interpreting the NS sensitivity.",
