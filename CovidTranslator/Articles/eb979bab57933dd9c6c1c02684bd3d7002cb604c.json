The majority of the analyzed dog population was unvaccinated (282/325), 24 animals were vaccinated but with incomplete vaccine protocols and 19 received complete protocols (Table 1) . Dogs defined as vaccinated received the complete vaccination protocol using three doses of polyvalent vaccine, while the ones defined as vaccinated with incomplete protocols received one or two doses. Polyvalent vaccines used in dogs in Brazil are constituted by CPV-2, CDV, CCoV, CAdV2, canine parainfluenza virus and Leptospira spp. with minor differences according the different manufacturers. The sanitary status was defined by the clinic during sample collection where 82/325 were apparently healthy, 77/325 presented enteric disease-associated signs and 166/325 had this information not determined.

PCR and RT-PCR positive samples were submitted for DNA sequencing (ACTGene An\u00e1lises Moleculares Ltda., Alvorada, RS, Brazil) in order to confirm the identities of amplified viruses. PCR amplification products were purified using the NucleoSpin Extract II Kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany).

Moreover, CDV causes a multisystemic disease with immunodepression that can favor infection by other pathogens including other diarrhea-associated viruses. 24 CRV and CAdV were also identified in 8.2 and 4.9% of the dogs tested, respectively. Both viral agents are linked to diarrhea and vomiting 13 and should not be excluded in the diagnosis of canine diarrhea. Moreover, CRV is a zoonotic pathogen, and its frequency in dogs needs to be determined to better assess the risk of infection in humans. The samples analyzed in the present study were obtained by convenience from veterinary clinics which could bias information regarding sanity. Nevertheless, CPV-2 remained as the most frequent viral agent in the different dog groups ( Table 1) .

The occurrence of co-infection can increase the pathogenicity of the disease since these viral agents can act as immunosuppressants. 12, 24, 25 There is a lack of studies searching for multiple viral pathogens in dogs, which could uncover the real etiology and interactions in the clinics. Moreover, a single search for the more common pathogens can reveal the real epidemiology of less common viral enteropathogens. Canine diarrhea can have other etiologies such as bacteria and parasites that are frequently reported. 15, 16 Despite CPV-2 being the most frequently detected diarrhea-associated viral pathogen in the present study, a high degree of co-infections was observed. These coinfection rates reinforce that the search for more common individual pathogens could uncover the real epidemiology of less common viral enteropathogens.",

In contrast with previous studies, CDV was the second most common viral agent detected, probably since it is endemic to Brazil and not to the regions sampled in other studies. Moreover, the high frequency of co-infected dogs that was observed can increase the pathogenicity of the disease. The data presented herein can improve the clinical knowledge in regions with low vaccine coverage and highlight the need to improve the methods of controlling infectious diseases in domestic dogs.",
