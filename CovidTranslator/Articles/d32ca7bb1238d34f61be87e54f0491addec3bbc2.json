As a result the swine industry provides about 25% of the energy and 9% of the protein that human beings obtain from animal sources (Pond, 1983) . The industry annually provides about 30-35 kg of highquality protein for each person in the United States. To increase production efficiency, innovative management practices have been instituted and biologicals are used to reduce disease-related losses. Moreover, swine production has changed from a large number of small farms to a relatively small number of large operations. Because of the intensive nature of these production units, losses due to contagious disease have been magnified, especially those manifested in the respi-ratory, reproductive, and enteric systems. To prevent diseases, swine are routinely vaccinated against common pathogens that are responsible for significant mortality, morbidity, and reduced weight gain. Some of the live vaccines, used, for example, against the viral diseases, are rotavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, pseudorabies virus, and parvovirus. In spite of the availability of effective vaccines for some diseases, novel pathogens (e.g., the porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus) continue to emerge and some of the attenuated virus (e.g., pseudorabies virus) vaccines can become latent.",

This disease is contagious and is characterized by encephalomyelitis and inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. Mortality can reach 100% in piglets under 2 weeks of age. The respiratory form of the disease is common in growing and adult pigs. In pregnant sows, abortion, mummification of fetuses, or stillbirths can occur depending on the stage of pregnancy. Recovered or subclinically infected pigs continue to shed virus leading to persistent herd infection. The annual cost of pseudorabies for swine producers was more than $21 million in the mid-1980s (Miller et al., 1996) . Most vaccines do provide clinical protection against disease but do not prevent shedding or multiplication of the virus. Thus, some animals remain carriers for variable periods and become a source of infection for susceptible animals. Therefore, it is important for vaccination to prevent or reduce virus shedding to the extent that transmission to other susceptible animals is reduced. To attenuate the virus further, several genetically engineered deletion mutants have been developed and evaluated for their ability to reduce virus shedding. The impact of such vaccines is not yet fully known. Several countries are attempting to eradicate pseudorabies virus infection in their swine populations with or without the use of vaccines. However, in certain regions feral swine harboring latent virus can still be a potential source of infection for the domestic swine. Eradication of pseudorabies virus from such a population is practically impossible.",

Economic losses in the United States due to neonatal diarrhea are estimated in excess of $200 million annually. Similar problems are encountered in other countries, such as Australia. Here, Mullan et al. (1994) estimated a loss of $260 to $330 per breeding sow in the ensuing 12 months after infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). According to the National Animal Monitoring System ofUSDA, TGE cost the pork industry located in Iowa alone $10 million annually in 1987 and 1988 (Hill, 1989) . TGEV causes a highly contagious enteric disease affecting pigs of all ages. In case of neonatal pigs, TGE is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, and mortality approaching 100%. This disease is caused by a coronavirus that is shed in feces and nasal secretions. Current vaccines consisting of attenuated or inactivated TGEV are inadequate (Saif and Jackwood, 1989; Saif and Wesley, 1992) .",

In many instances attenuation has been attempted by serial passage of the virulent virus in an in vitro cell culture system. Live attenuated vaccines are developed by trying to establish the balance between maximum immunogenicity and minimum virulence for the host. Because the genetic makeup of such vaccine strains is not known, in many cases there is the risk of reversion to virulence under field conditions. Efficacy of vaccines is usually determined by the protective immune response in the host. Because immunity can be broken by an overwhelming challenge, no vaccine can be claimed as \"perfect.\" Recovery from a natural infection usually leads to a strong and long-lasting protection against reinfection by the same pathogen. Although a vaccine that is completely safe normally does not induce as strong an immunity as the natural infection, to be efficacious it should induce an appreciable degree of protective immunity in the host when exposed to a reasonable natural challenge.",

However, as mentioned earlier, they often pose the threat of reversion to virulence and transmissibility to other species and often are required to be maintained at a correct passage level. Moreover, the same vaccine produced by different biological manufacturers may have a varied potential for reversion to virulence. Furthermore, it is probable that in vivo recombination either between different vaccine strains and/or field strains, for example, pseudorabies virus, will result in the generation of a strain with greater virulence than the original vaccine strain(s). These concerns are unwarranted when using inactivated or subunit vaccines; however, frequent administration is required and, therefore, application of killed vaccines becomes more expensive than the use of live vaccines. Although in designing a vaccine the main emphasis is to protect the host against the disease, it is also important to consider the duration of immunity, lack of any adverse effects, ease of administration, and low cost. The increasing number of vaccines against common and emerging pathogens has made their individual administration impractical. In this regard, the biological companies have realized for a long time the advantages of combined vaccines that will protect against several diseases. Because multi-antigenic vaccines require a relatively lower number of injections, the cost of packaging, storage, delivery equipment, and labor are reduced.",

Using modern genetic engineering techniques, it is possible to isolate, identify, and sequence important genes of pathogenic organisms and place them into new vectors in which they can be faithfully expressed. Both bacterial and viral vectors can be used for the expression of foreign genes. Bacteria are easy to manipulate and can provide a high level of expression, but in bacteria glycosylation, proteolytic processing, and subunit assembly of eukaryotic proteins may not occur properly. Consequently, the use of such vectors may not result in the production of an authentic protein(s). Therefore, the genomes of both small and large viruses, for example, baculoviruses, adenoviruses, herpesviruses, and poxviruses, have been manipulated for expression of foreign proteins. The genomes of the large-sized viruses (e.g., poxviruses and herpesviruses) are difficult to alter but have the capacity to express a significant amount of foreign genetic material (i.e., several foreign genes). When considering herpesviruses as vaccine vectors, however, it is important to consider their potential for delayed persistence and oncogenesis. On the other hand the small-sized viruses (e.g., adenoviruses) have the limitation that their genomes can accommodate only a small amount of foreign genetic material without the virus becoming defective in replication.",

When those genes encode for antigens responsible for eliciting an immune response, the resultant recombinant viruses have been shown to elicit protective immunity in animals against the respective pathogens. Thus, when foreign genes are expressed under vaccinia virus regulation, the proteins are produced in a native state. Because the genome of vaccinia virus has the ability to accept up to 25,000 bp of inserted foreign DNA, more than 10 foreign genes could conceivably be expressed by a single live recombinant virus (Flexner and Moss, 1997) . Thus the demonstrated and potential success with vaccinia virus as a gene expression vector has kept its popularity unchallenged for so many years. However, because of its wide host range, there has been reluctance in accepting vaccinia-vectored vaccines due to postvaccination complications in humans (Gurvich, 1992) , which were observed during the use of vaccinia for the eradication of smallpox. Consequently, this technology has been applied to host-specific avianpox viruses (e.g., fowlpox and canarypox viruses).

Consequently, several recombinant fowlpox viruses expressing specific proteins from a variety of avian pathogens were created. Immunization of susceptible birds with such recombinants resulted in the development of specific antibodies and enabled protection to subsequent challenge with the respective virulent pathogen (Tripathy, 1996) . These developments have resulted in the licensing of a recombinant fowlpox virus vaccine expressing the hemagglutinin of Newcastle disease virus.

Because more than 99% of the progeny from such an infection retain the parental genome, a procedure for the screening/selection of the recombinant progeny is required. One method of identification utilizes the Escherichia coli lacZ gene as a marker. In this case, a chromogenic substrate, 5-bromo--4chloro-3 indolyl~-D-galactosidase (X-gal), which is converted to a blue compound by the action of the expressed enzyme (~-galactosidase) is then used to identify ..the virus plaques produced by the recombinant virus in the progeny against a background of colorless plaques generated by nonrecombinant viruses. Alternatively, recombinants carrying the E. coli xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase gene (gpt) as a marker can be selected due to their resistance to mycophenolic acid (Boyle and Coupar, 1988) . In addition, recombinant viruses can be identified by plaque hybridization using a DNA probe specific for the inserted foreign gene. Thymidine kinase-deficient (TK-) cells have been used effectively in the selection of recombinant viruses in which foreign genes were introduced within the TK gene. Since a TK-cell line of swine origin which will allow selective growth of the recombinant TK-swinepox virus is not available, inclusion of the marker gene becomes important to facilitate selection/screening of the recombinant virus.",

It is possible that in certain instances in vivo recombination of different vaccine strains may result in the generation of recombinants with virulence greater than that of involved vaccine strains. Vaccinia virus vectored vaccines, on the other hand, have proved to be highly successful immunizing agents, but regular application of such live recombinant vaccinia viruses has been controversial because of minor complications associated with the vaccination program against smallpox. Therefore, the development of live vaccines that are self-restricted, which cannot be transmitted from vaccinated animals to contact animals, and which are not released into the environment would be ideal. Limited experimental studies with TK-inactivated swinepox virus indicate that such live swinepox virus monovalent or polyvalent vaccine vectors can be created.",

            "text": "Lack of adequate local immunity by parenterally administered vaccines against those pathogens whose portal of entry is respiratory or gastrointestinal tract has been realized for a long time. Indeed vaccinia vectored vaccines administered parenterally stimulate protective levels of serum IgG antibody and cellular immunity but do not induce mucosal immunity associated with IgA antibody. Because oral immunization with recombinant vaccinia virus containing the rabies glycoprotein gene provided protection against rabies (Rupprecht et al., 1986) , field trials are being conducted with an oral bait for vaccinating wild animals for the control of rabies. In this case, immunization probably occurs due to viral replication in the tonsils. Safety and efficacy of oral vaccination of raccoons by feeding raccoonpox virus containing rabies virus glycoprotein in sponge-baits has been described by Esposito et al. (1988) . Enteric immunization of mice with recombinant vaccinia virus containing the influenza virus hemagglutinin gene induced mucosal IgA antibody, serum IgG antibody, and cell-mediated immunity (Meitin et al., 1994) . Similarly, mice immunized intragastrically with recombinant vaccinia virus containing the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein genes of influenza virus were protected against influenza (Bender et al., 1996) .",

Additionally, antibodies in the sera and antibodies of IgA class in the intestinal contents of swine infected orally with swinepox virus have been observed providing further evidence of virus multiplication after oral administration (Tuboly et al., 1993) . This study suggests that swinepox virus can be a potential vector for the expression of antigens from enteric and respiratory viral agents of swine. Use of an oral vaccine for enteric pathogens would not only be convenient for mass administration through the drinking water but less expensive than conventional vaccines. Additionally, swinepox virus could be used in the construction of a multivalent recombinant vaccine because of its ability to accommodate a large amount of foreign genetic material. Alternatively, combined recombinant vaccines expressing different antigens could be used to protect against multiple pathogens. Whether oral or intranasal administration of recombinant swinepox virus vaccine expressing antigens of enteric/respiratory pathogens would induce a desirable protective immune response needs to be determined. If such an effective recombinant vaccine is ever developed, the swine industry would benefit tremendously.",

One major advantage for viral vector vaccines is their ability to elicit a protective cell-mediated immunity as well as a humoral response to the antigen delivered by the vector. One major problem to using recombinant viruses as vaccines is the pathogenic potential of the parent virus.
