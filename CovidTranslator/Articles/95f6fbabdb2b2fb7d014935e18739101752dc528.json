            "text": "Pneumomediastinum is defined as the presence of air or gas in the mediastinum. Its etiology may be primary (spontaneous pneumomediastinum) or secondary (traumatic pneumomediastinum). 1 Spontaneous pneumomediastinum was defined as a specific clinical syndrome by Laennec in 1819. In 1944 Macklin and Macklin 2 described the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the syndrome, and their description is still valid today. Since then few cases have been reported, and with few exceptions, these have tended to be isolated cases rather than large series. 3 Trigger factors have been described as all those noniatrogenic factors contributing to an increase in the pressure gradient between the alveoli and the interstitium. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Clinical presentation varies widely from one series to another and there are no pathognomonic signs or symptoms. 3, 9, 10 The presence of Hamman's sign (pericardial crunch synchronized with the heart beat) is quite variable (5%-85%) and is not currently considered to be a characteristic sign. 9 We report a series of 36 cases of spontaneous pneumomediastinum diagnosed and treated in our hospital between January 1996 and December 2003.",

            "text": "We Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is defined as a primary process characterized by the presence of air or gas in the mediastinum. We report all the cases of spontaneous pneumomediastinum diagnosed in our hospital between January 1996 and December 2004. We developed a protocol for data collection that included the following: medical history, triggers, signs, radiology, treatment, hospital stay, and complications. During this period we diagnosed 36 cases-25 men (69.4%) and 11 women (30.6%)-with a mean age of 36.8 years (range, 11-90 years) and a mean hospital stay of 8.56 days (range, 1-53 days). The most common clinical presentation was chest pain, either isolated (27%) or with associated dyspnea (19.4%). A triggering factor was identified for 14 patients (38.8%). There was no associated morbidity or mortality. In view of our findings, we concluded that spontaneous pneumomediastinum is an uncommon entity with considerable clinical variability and that correct diagnosis requires a high level of suspicion. Radiography provides the best evidence for diagnosis. Neumomediastino espont\u00e1neo: estudio descriptivo de nuestra experiencia basada en 36 casos El neumomediastino espont\u00e1neo se define como la presencia de aire o gas en el mediastino de forma primaria. Presentamos todos los casos de neumomediastino espont\u00e1neo hallados en nuestro hospital entre enero de 1996 y diciembre de 2004. Para ello, elaboramos un protocolo de recogida de datos que incluy\u00f3: antecedentes personales, desencadenantes, semiolog\u00eda, radiolog\u00eda, tratamiento, estancia y complicaciones. En este per\u00edodo diagnosticamos 36 casos -25 varones (69,4%) y 11 mujeres (27,5%)-, con una edad media de 36,8 a\u00f1os (rango: 11-90) y estancia media de 8,56 d\u00edas (rango: 1-53). El cuadro cl\u00ednico m\u00e1s habitual fue el dolor tor\u00e1cico, aislado (27%) o asociado a disnea (19,4%). En 14 pacientes (38,8%) hubo factor desencadenante. No hubo morbimortalidad asociada al proceso. Por todo ello, se concluye que el neumomediastino espont\u00e1neo es una entidad infrecuente, con gran variabilidad cl\u00ednica, cuyo diagn\u00f3stico correcto exige un alto \u00edndice de sospecha, y la radiograf\u00eda de t\u00f3rax es la prueba id\u00f3nea para ello.",

Regarding the possibility of classification biases reported with the use of the MBDS, 15 it should be pointed out that our study used the MBDS only as a starting point, and that clinical histories were subsequently reviewed to verify the correct classification of the episode.

The diagnostic capacity of chest radiography is such that we do not consider it necessary to use computed tomography in managing this disease, as some authors recommend, 11, 17, 18 or to perform esophagograms or electrocardiograms. 3, 10 With conservative treatment (analgesia and oxygen therapy), all of the cases were resolved. There were no associated complications or mortality. The mean hospital stay in our series was somewhat higher than in others, 3, 9, 10 probably due to the absence of any other associated underlying disease in the patients in other series. In our series, more than half the patients had associated diseases, thus accounting for longer periods of hospitalization. Studies have recently been published in which a correlation was found between longer hospital stay and the presence of comorbidity. 19, 20 Mean hospital stays in the general surgery ward (young patients with no relevant medical history) were very similar to those published. 3, 9, 10, 12 Given the success of conservative management of spontaneous pneumomediastinum and the absence of complications, the suitability of outpatient treatment and follow-up could be considered in stable patients, as other authors have suggested. 10, 13 Due to the considerable clinical variability and low incidence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum, correct diagnosis of this disease requires maintaining a high level of suspicion, especially in young patients (between 20 and 40 years), men (3:1), those with a history of bronchial asthma or smoking, and those who present with a clinical picture that includes the spontaneous appearance of chest pain, either isolated or with associated dyspnea. Simple chest radiography (posteroanterior and lateral) will lead to a definitive diagnosis.",
