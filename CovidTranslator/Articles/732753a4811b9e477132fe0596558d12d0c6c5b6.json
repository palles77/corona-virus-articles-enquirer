However, the variation of the S gene between viruses may affect the efficacy of a vaccine, particularly for cross-protection against SARS-like CoV (SL-CoV). Recently, a more conserved group-specific open reading frame (ORF), the 3a gene, was found in both SARS-CoV and SL-CoV. Here, we studied the immunogenicity of human SARS-CoV 3a and bat SL-CoV 3a DNA vaccines in mice through electroporation immunization followed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent, enzyme-linked immunospot, and flow cytometry assays. Our results showed that high levels of specific humoral responses were induced by SARS-CoV 3a and SL-CoV 3a DNA vaccines. Furthermore, a strong Th1-based cellular immune response was stimulated by both DNA vaccines. The vaccines stimulated gamma interferon production mainly by CD8 \u0609 T cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2) mainly by CD4 \u0609 T cells. Of interest, the frequency of IL-2-positive cells elicited by the SARS-CoV 3a DNA vaccine was significantly higher than that elicited by the SL-CoV 3a DNA vaccine. In summary, our study provides a reference for designing cross-protective DNA vaccines based on the group-specific ORFs of CoVs.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiologic agent of SARS (8, 19) . On the basis of the full-length genome sequence of SARS-CoV, all predicted open reading frames (ORFs) are divided into two groups: (i) those with clear homologies to other CoVs (including replicase and structural genes) and (ii) the eight group-specific ORFs with no clear homology to any known genes in the database (17, 22) . To date, vaccine studies have focused on the roles of viral structural proteins (3, 10) ; little is known regarding the function of the group-specific proteins. One of these group-specific genes, the 3a gene, is located between the S and E loci of the membrane protein genes and encodes a 31-kDa protein with 274 amino acids (aa). A bioinformatics study suggests that the 3a protein contains three putative transmembrane domains in topology with a 34-aa N-terminal extracellular matrix and a C-terminal intracellular domain containing aa 134 to 274 (23) . The 3a protein is localized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum/ Golgi compartments and interacts with the S and M glycoproteins. Recently, the 3a protein was shown to form an ion channel and modulate virus release (16) . The 3a protein may play important roles in viral replication (1) , raising the possibility that the 3a protein could be a potential target for vaccine and drug design.",

The amino acids (aa 15 to 28) in the ectodomain of the 3a protein were also shown to induce neutralizing antibodies in a previous study (2) . However, whether the full length of the 3a DNA is immunogenic remains fully undetermined. Recently, SARS-like CoV (SL-CoV), which has a close genetic homology to SARS-CoV, was isolated from horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) (14, 15) . Most of the group-specific ORFs that exist in SARS-CoV, including the 3a gene, are also present in SL-CoV. The 3a protein of SL-CoV is \u03f383% identical to that of SARS-CoV at the amino acid level. To date, the immunogenicity and the biological function of 3a in SL-CoV remain unknown. To better understand the biological function of 3a, we investigated the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV and SL-CoV 3a as DNA vaccines in BALB/c mice.",

As shown in Fig. 4A , 3a-specific CD4 \u03e9 or CD8 \u03e9 IFN-\u2425-producing T cells were detected in splenocytes. Both 3a DNA vaccines enhanced specific T-cell responses, compared with the levels for the control groups. The frequency of IFN-\u2425 in the CD8 \u03e9 T-cell populations was higher than that in the CD4 \u03e9 T cells. The frequency of IL-2-producing cells in CD4 \u03e9 or CD8 \u03e9 T cells was also analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4B , IL-2-positive cells were the predominant population in CD4 \u03e9 T cells and to a lesser extent in CD8 \u03e9 T cells. Surprisingly, there was a significant difference in IL-2producing T-cell response between the two 3a genes in both CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells (P \u03fd 0.01). another SARS epidemic, continuous efforts have been made toward the development of a prophylactic vaccine. It is generally accepted that an effective SARS vaccine should act not only to prevent the reemergence of SARS-CoV but also to provide cross-protection against SL-CoV that is isolated from horseshoe bats, the possible animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV. To date, a variety of candidate vaccines, such as DNA (26), adenovirus-mediated gene transfer (7), a combination of whole killed virus and DNA (13), inactive virus (21), and recombined proteins or their fragments, are under preclinical or clinical studies. Among these, a DNA vaccine is the most promising strategy because it is safe and can induce both neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses. Current SARS vaccine development has mainly been focused on the spike protein. Although spike protein-based vaccines elicit strong cellular immune responses and protective humoral responses, the relatively high variation of the S gene between viruses could compromise its usage, particularly for cross-protection (25) . Therefore, other SARS vaccine candidates are urgently needed. The 3a gene is a group-specific ORF found in both SARS-CoV and SL-CoV. In the current study, we investigated the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV and SL-CoV 3a DNA vaccines in BALB/c mice. From our results, both SARS-CoV and SL-CoV 3a DNA vaccines were found to induce specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. The level of 3a-specific antibody was greatly enhanced following two boosts. Our finding is supported by a previous study showing that the amino acids (aa 15 to 28) in the ectodomain of the 3a protein induced neutralizing antibodies in rabbits (2) . Of interest, there was a significant difference (P \u03fd 0.05) in terms of antibody responses at 52 days postimmunization between the SARS-CoV and SL-CoV 3a DNA vaccines, although the two genes are well conserved (83% at the amino acid level). This difference could be due to the presence of different B-or T-cell epitopes. Further studies are required to address the precise amino acid difference between SARS-CoV and SL-CoV 3a proteins that leads to the change of antigen determinants.",

            "text": "In addition to humoral responses, T-cell immune responses were also demonstrated in our study. T lymphocytes are generally divided into helper (CD4) and CTL (CD8) cells. CD4 T cells can increase the number of memory cells which respond rapidly when reexposed to pathogens and thus play a vital role in protection against virus challenge (5, 6) . After activation, naive antigen-specific CD8 T cells are able to proliferate quickly and differentiate into potent effector cells capable of rapid cytokine production and cytolytic killing of target cells (9) . CD4 lymphocytes are further subdivided into Th1 and Th2 on the basis of the type of released cytokines (20) . Th1 cells secrete IL-2 and IFN-\u2425. Th2 cells, on the other hand, secrete IL-4 and IL-5. Th1 cells predominantly confer protective immunity and play a crucial role in long-term protection and virus eradication, while Th2 cells provide help for antibody production (4, 18) . In the present study, a strong Th1-type response was detected by the ELISPOT assay, which was consistent with the ELISA results; this response may play a vital role in protection against virus challenge. In order to further address the Th1-type response, we examined the frequencies of IFN-\u2425-and IL-2-positive cells in CD4 \u03e9 or CD8 \u03e9 splenocytes by flow cytometric analysis. Of the two Th1 cytokines, IFN-\u2425 is an effector cytokine able to activate macrophage cells and to inhibit viral replication (24); IL-2 is a growth factor which plays important roles in maintaining memory cells and mediating the expansion of both CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells (12) . Our results revealed that IFN-\u2425 was mainly produced by CD8 \u03e9 T cells and that IL-2 was predominantly produced by CD4 \u03e9 T cells. Of interest, the frequency of IL-2-positive cells in CD4 \u03e9 or CD8 \u03e9 splenocytes elicited by the SL-CoV 3a DNA vaccine was significantly lower than that elicited by the SARS-CoV 3a DNA vaccine. These data suggest that the gene products of SARS-CoV and SL-CoV 3a DNA may be different in structure or conformation, which could lead the difference in immunogenicity.",
