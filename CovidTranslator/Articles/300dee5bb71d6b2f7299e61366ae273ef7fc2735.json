Despite progress in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease, calf diarrhea remains a major cause of economic loss to the cattle industry.

            "text": "According to the World Health Organization, the development of successful oral rehydration therapy is one of the major advances of human medicine in this century. Oral rehydration therapy has saved numerous human infants and neonatal animals with diarrhea; however, oral rehydration may not rapidly restore the hydration status of moderately to severely dehydrated calves. In these circumstances, intravenous fluid therapy remains the best treatment option for dehydration. The approach to intravenous fluid therapy should be simple and cheap to serve the needs of practitioners and agricultural producers. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of intravenous fluid therapy in calves using practical on-farm treatment options. calves with diarrhea. Neonatal calf diarrhea occurs in the first 4 weeks of life and usually is caused by mixed infections with viral (rotavirus, coronavirus), bacterial (Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp), and protozoal (Cryptosporidium parvum) pathogens. Neonatal calves have a higher total body water content (-75 % body weight) and a higher extracellular fluid volume (-45 % body weight) than adult herbivores. Calves are also believed to be more sensitive to fluid losses than adult cattle, and the high proportional water content in calves is not believed to serve as a water reservoir and has no protective effect against dehydration. 43 ,89 Fecal fluid losses in profuse watery neonatal diarrhea can reach 13% to 18% body weight per day, and are often underestimated in clinical cases. 22 ,89 In extreme cases, calves can lose up to 21 % of their body weight in 24 hours when oral fluids are given at the same time. 22 The kidneys can compensate for increased fluid losses by decreasing urine production, but if losses exceed fluid intake, dehydration follows. 45 ,84 Large fecal losses of water, sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate in neonatal calf diarrhea decrease the extracellular fluid volume, causing decreased plasma volume and venous return, extracellular dehydration, and total body loss of water and electrolytes. The fluid and electrolyte losses in the early stage of neonatal calf diarrhea are primarily of secretory origin and, to a much lesser extent, of osmotic origin. 21 Even in viral infections with rotavirus or coronavirus and in protozoal infections with cryptosporidia, secretory mechanisms are believed to contribute to the diarrhea and dehydration. 21 Hyponatremia is common in dehydrated calves with diarrhea,13, 76, 79 but hypernatremia can also occur, particularly when calves are treated with oral electrolyte solutions and do not have access to fresh water. 98, 101 The total body potassium content is decreased in diarrhea, but hyperkalemia is a frequent observation in diarrheic calves with acidemia. Hyperkalemia is the result of complicated and not fully understood mechanisms involving hyponatremia, hypo-osmolality, acidemia, and cellular hypoxia?6 Neonatal diarrhea usually causes a hypo-osmotic extracellular dehydration with decreased extracellular fluid volume (plasma and interstitial) and a small increase in intracellular fluid volume. 24 , 78, 79 Hyperosmotic dehydration may be observed in chronic diarrhea and shortly before death. 44, 45 The cost-effective use of electrolyte-containing oral rehydration solutions for the treatment of diarrheic calves is popular and widely accepted. 72 Calves with diarrhea presented to veterinary practitioners or teaching hospitals therefore have often been treated with oral fluids of varying compositions. Recent observations found that approximately 50% of diarrheic calves had been treated with oral fluids alone or in combination with other treatments before they were admitted to a referring practice or teaching hospita1. 3, 22, 37, 46, 59 Mixing errors of oral rehydration solutions occur frequently, and witholding milk is common practice by some farmers. 80, 98 Therefore, hypernatremia and hyperchloremia can be found in calves with diarrhea, particularly if the calf has not had access to fresh water. 33, 45, 80, 89, 98 Calves often are in poor body condition when they have been treated with oral fluids for several days without feeding milk. 22, 85 According to these observations, it can be assumed that electrolyte disturbances and the type of dehydration (iso-, hypo-, or hyperosmotic) can vary among individual cases presented for treatment, and are very difficult to predict.",

            "text": "The widely accepted indication for intravenous fluid administration in dehydrated calves is a decrease of 8% body weight, although experimental evidence supporting 8% dehydration as the most appropriate intervention point is currently unavailable. A recent study did demonstrate, however, that calves that were 8% dehydrated required at least 24 hours to be adequately rehydrated by orally administered electrolyte solutions. 11 Recumbent, severely depressed, or comatose calves, and calves without a suckle reflex, also need intravenous fluid resuscitation?' 13, 22, 39, 62, 84, 85, 89, 91, 103 Calves that do not fall into these categories but show a rapidly progressing dehydration with consistent profuse watery diarrhea should also be treated intravenously rather than rehydrated by ororuminal intubation?3 If treatment with oral fluids is not successful and only a weak suckle reflex is present, initial intravenous restoration of fluid and electrolyte deficits is preferred. 85 Collapsed dehydrated calves in severe hypovolemic shock are not able to rapidly resorb sufficient amounts of oral or subcutaneously administered fluids and should be rehydrated intravenously. 7, 11, 27, 62, 73 Resuscitation by intravenous fluid administration will restore oxygen delivery and remove the metabolic products of poorly perfused tissues. 14 Another indication for intravenous fluid therapy is resuscitation of severely depressed calves that have asphyxia and mixed respiratorymetabolic acidosis.42, 67, 86 Moreover, severely depressed calves with acidemia but without clinical signs of dehydration also need intravenous alkalinizing fluids to restore the disturbed body functions. 50 , 52, 93 Based on the this, the goals of intravenous fluid therapy in dehydrated calves should be to correct extracellular dehydration and restore circulating blood volume; correct the acidemia (increase blood pH >7.20); correct mental depression; restore the suckle reflex; correct electrolyte abnormalities; correct the energy deficit; facilitate repair of damaged intestinal surface.",

            "text": "Serial measurements of body weight are needed for the exact determination of hydration status and the degree of dehydration in calves. As this is not practical, conventional classification systems for dehydration on the basis of clinical symptoms have been used on an empirical basis to guide calculation of dehydration in diarrheic calves. 47 , 51, 87 As fluid losses in diarrheic calves are primarily from the extracellular space, the clinical assessment of existing deficits is based on estimating the loss of extracellular fluid volume.13 Guidelines to predict fluid losses were first presented by Watt,105 who classified dehydration as mild, moderate, and severe. These three categories have been widely used and extrapolated to evaluate hydration status in calves?' 47, 50-52, 87 These guidelines have included the degree of enophthalmus, skin tent duration, moisture and color of mucus membranes, and capillary refill time. Other factors that have been investigated have included serial determinations of packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin and plasma protein concentration, the temperature of extremities (ear and distal limb), and measurement of mean central venous pressure. Several authors have assigned similar percentages of decrease in body weight to three categories of mild, moderate, and severe dehydration without proof on supporting data. 88 A recent study from Constable and coworkers 13 proved the usefulness of various clinical signs of dehydration in calves and verified the preciseness of these predictors for use in clinical practice. In a study with an experimental diarrhea model that induced acute and severe dehydration, the best predictors of the magnitude of dehydration were extent of eyeball recession into the orbit, skin elasticity on the neck and thorax, and plasma protein concentration (Table 1 ).13 The degree of enophthalmos was estimated by everting the lower eyelid to its normal position and estimating the recession of the globe into the orbit. Skin elasticity was measured in the lateral midcervical area by pinching a skinfold, rotating it 90 degrees, and measuring the time for the skinfold to disappear. 13 The new experimentally determined guidelines to assess hydration status in diarrheic calves are reproduced in Table 1 . They provide the most practical and accurate method for predicting hydration status in calves with diarrhea, and are therefore useful for determining the need for intravenous fluid therapy. Additionally, Figure 1 shows the relationship between the degree of enophthalmus and the corresponding dehydration in percentage of body weight found in this study.1 3 The results of this study indicated that dehydration can be detected at lower values than previously thought, in that dehydration at 2% body weight appeared with skin tent duration of 3 seconds, a slight enophthalmus of 1 mm, and with dry mucous membranes. Enophthalmus and cervical skintent duration increased linearly with percentage of dehydration (see Fig.  1 ). At 8% dehydration, enophthalmus was 4 mm, cervical skin-tent duration was 6 seconds, and the extremities felt cool. Very severe and life-threatening dehydration of 12% or 14% or more displayed enophthalmus of 7 or 8 mm or more, skin tent duration of more than 8 or 10 seconds, and cold extremities and white mucous membranes (see Table  1 ; Pig. 1).13 These guidelines provide the practitioner a practical and accurate method to hydration status in calves with diarrhea. Limitations of the guidelines from Table 1 are calves with chronic diarrhea and in calves where fluid losses are into the third space. 13 , 102 As the position of the eye within the orbit is also dependent on body fat stores and not only the hydration status, it may therefore be of limited use to determine hydration status in calves with chronic diarrhea and dehydration. 13 In cachectic calves or calves with chronic diarrhea, pliability of the skin of the neck and thorax is the most exact and useful indicator.13 Because assessment of hydration status with charts and tables will always be subjective and initial estimates may be inaccurate, it is advised to \"guess and to reassess\" the patient several times during rehydration therapy.35,88",

            "text": "A more advanced but less useful tool to predict the need for intravenous fluid therapy in diarrheic calves is measuring rectal temperature and peripheral temperature at the fetlock with a portable thermistor.14 A rectal temperature less than 38.0\u00b0C \u00ab100\u00b0F), indicating hypothermia and a decrease in skin temperature of the extremities (ears and limbs), is commonly observed in calves with diarrhea. 3 , 14, 50-52, 71, 101 Hypothermic diarrheic calves exhibit an increase in the difference between temperature of the rectum and the skin of extremities. 14 , 23, 78 Because cardiac output is positively correlated with rectal and peripheral temperature as well as hydration status, a reduction in cardiac output below 65% of normal should be suspected if the peripheral skin temperature over the fetlock joint of hind limbs is below 32\u00b0C (90\u00b0F) or if the temperature difference between the rectum and fetlock is beyond 7\u00b0C (13\u00b0P).14 In Figure 2 the relationship between a decrease of peripheral fetlock temperature associated with a decrease of cardiac index below 65% of normal \u00ab170 mL X min-I X kg-I) is shown in calves with various degrees of dehydration (Fig. 2 ). Calves with a cardiac output greater than 65% of normal did not exhibit a decrease in peripheral temperature (see Fig. 2 ).14 It is not known what percentage decrease in cardiac output should be used to guide intravenous fluid therapy in calves, but to preserve satisfactory cardiac output during fluid therapy, a peripheral temperature of more than 32\u00b0C (fetlock) and a difference between rectal and peripheral temperature of less than 7\u00b0e should be maintained for effective fluid therapy if calves are housed in a thermoneutral environment. 14 Assessment of ear temperature is less accurate than fetlock temperature, and hands are much less accurate at measuring fetlock temperature than thermistors 14 ; however, peripheral temperature determinations are limited and should not be performed when calves are housed below 100e (50\u00b0F), as physiological peripheral vasoconstriction decreases skin temperature. 14 This greatly limits the utility of peripheral temperature in guiding the need for intravenous fluid therapy. Heart rate is a poor predictor of the need for intravenous fluid therapy and the presence of hyperkalemia. A study of a large number of calves with naturally aquired diarrhea showed no correlation between heart rate and blood potassium concentration,53 although another study found that heart rate increased linearly with serum potassium concentration, up to [K+] = 8 mEq/L.lD Bradycardia, defined as less than 90 beats per minute, is seen in hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and hyperkalemia. 7 3 Auscultable cardiac arrhythmias in dehydrated diarrheic calves are be-lieved to indicate the presence of severe hyperkalemia ([K+] >8 mEq/ L).73, 106 Therefore it is recommended that if cardiac arrhythmias and bradycardia \u00ab90 beats/min) are present that sodium bicarbonate should immediately be administered intravenously because of the likelihood that life-threatening hyperkalemia is present. 73 Additional stress should be avoided during therapy of hyperkalemic calves, as excessive restraint may cause sudden collapse and death of severely shocked calves. 54",

            "text": "Metabolic acidosis is a common finding in calves with diarrhea. Treatment of acidemia with alkalinizing solutions is important for restoration of normal body function and suckle reflex. The gold standard method for determining the severity of metabolic acidosis is blood gas analysis, and the recent availability of portable blood-gas machines has made such analysis more practical. A less expensive hand-held portable pH-meter (Cardy Twin pH meter, Spectrum Technologies, Inc., Plainfield, IL) has also been used to measure blood pH.64,65 Other laboratory methods for determining the severity of metabolic acidosis have also been studied. Total CO 2 concentration (TC0 2 ), determined either with the simple Harleco apparatus or with automated laboratory electrolyte analyzers, provides an accurate guide to plasma bicarbonate concentration and can therefore be used to screen for metabolic acidosis. 3 , 32, 36, 37,68 TC0 2 determination also enables calculation of the amount of buffer needed to correct a metabolic acidosis 32 , 68; however, clinical prediction of acidemia is much more commonly done in veterinary practice than measurement of acid-base status. Metabolic acidosis in calves with and without dehydration can be predicted from their ability to stand, suckling force, level of depression, and their age with variable success. 3 ,30, 50-52, 71 In contrast, the degree of enophthalmos and peripheral temperature should not be used to predict the severity of metabolic acidosis, as acidosis is not correlated with degree of dehydration,3, 13, 37, 52, 69, 71 and severe metabolic acidosis can be found in calves with depression and ataxia or recumbency but minimal or no diarrhea and dehydration.I, 37, 50, 52, 93 In several landmark papers, Naylor 69 -71 identified that age differences in the severity of acidemia in diarrheic calves could be used to facilitate calculation of buffer therapy. Diarrheic calves in their first week of life were less acidemic than calves more than 8 days of age, the latter having almost twice the base deficit of younger calves. The finding that diarrheic calves older than 1 week of age had a more severe metabolic acidosis has been confirmed in several other studies. 1, 3, 36, 37 For use in practice, Naylor 70 devised a simple protocol for the treatment of metabolic acidosis in diarrheic calves less than 8 days and more than 8 days of age, which has been adapted and modified by others.I8, 28, 66, 107 Recently, data were obtained from 65 calves with naturally occuring diar-rhea that permitted estimation of base deficit using either suckling force or ability to stand alone without differentiation for age. 30 When suckle reflex was strong, weak, or absent, diarrheic calves had a mean base deficit of 4.2 mEq/L, 11.4 mEq/L, or 21.5 mEq/L, respectively. Diarrheic calves that were standing strongly, weakly, or were unable to stand had a mean base deficit of 5.2 mEq/L, 7.8 mEq/L, and 19.1 mEq/L, respectively. 30 A modified algorithm for a diagnostic and therapeutic approach of diarrheic calves on the basis of Naylor's original work and several other studies is presented in Figure 3 .",

Because metabolic acidosis is almost always present in calves requiring intravenous administration, calves require administration of alkalinizing buffer substances. The rapid correction of severe base deficits due to fecal bicarbonate losses has the highest priority in the treatment of calves with neonatal diarrhea. 91 Administration of alkalinizing solutions will minimize the deleterious effects of acidemia and restore the suckle reflex. 49 , 51, 91 Sodium bicarbonate is the alkalinizing agent of choice and is most often used as a 1.3% isotonic solution (13 g NaHC0 3 /L). Isotonic sodium bicarbonate is the most important solution for the treatment of metabolic acidosis in calves with and without dehydration. Higher concentrations of sodium bicarbonate solutions (4.2% or 8.4%) have also been recommended, but as they may be deleterious, isotonic bicarbonate is preferred. 3 The tremendous clinical and successful therapeutic effects of isotonic sodium bicarbonate containing 155 mEq/L bicarbonate buffer anions (HC0 3 -) and equal amounts of sodium has been described in a large number of interventional and therapeutic studies. Naylor's group first confirmed the overall advantage of sodium bicarbonate as a rapid alkalinizing and resuscitating agent for intravenous buffer therapy of metabolic acidosis in dehydrated calves. 51 , 69, 75 Other metabolizable bases or bicarbonate precursors, such as lactate, and synthetic buffer substances, such as Trisbuffer, have also been used31, 96; however, sodium bicarbonate has proven to be more effective. A recent study compared two relatively new and non-C0 2 -producing buffer mixtures, Carbicarb and Tribonate, with CO 2producing sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of metabolic and mixed respiratory-metabolic acidosis in calves 3 ,4; however, the results indicate that further research is needed before Carbicarb can be recommended for the use in practice.",

Isotonic sodium bicarbonate (1.3% = 13 g NaHC0 3 /L = 155 mEq HC0 3 -/L + 155 mEq Na + /L) at a dose of 1 to 4 L is recommended for intravenous treatment of dehydrated diarrheic calves with metabolic acidosis. Isotonic sodium bicarbonate rapidly corrects metabolic acidosis and dehydration to restore normal cellular function. Once the suckle reflex is re-established, further treatment can be given orally. Correcting dehydration with rapid administration of small volumes of hypertonic saline solutions (4-5 mL/kg body weight, 7.2% NaCI, or 7.2% NaCI in 6% dextran-70) successfully resuscitates the dehydrated calf but does not correct metabolic acidosis. Therefore, administration of hypertonic saline solutions should be accompanied by intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion in severely acidemic calves or by oral alkalinizing agents (acetate, propionate) in mildly to moderately acidemic calves. Dextrose should be added to the isotonic solutions if blood glucose is less than 60 mg/ dL to counteract hypoglycemia and to provide additional energy.",

Ear catheters allow the application of sufficient amounts of fluids by continuous drip infusion to calves,3, 28, 57, 58 and are believed to create fewer complications than jugular catheters.38, 41,100 A recent report evaluating the use of auricular vein catheters primarily in adult cattle stated that this technique was easy to perform, safe, and less expensive because fewer catheters have to be discarded. 92 Veterinarians should practice the ear catheterization technique in dehydrated calves because it may require training to place a 22-gauge catheter into an ear vein. For better distention and visualisation of the ear veins, a sponge or gauze soaked with warm water (45\u00b0C = 113\u00b0F) should be applied for at least 1 minute to increase blood flow to the ear. A 22-gauge, I-inch long (0.9 X 25 mm) catheter (Vasocan Brauniile, B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) with a moveable butterfly-shaped wing at the catheter hub is recommended for ear vein catheterization in calves. 28 , 41,57 In countries where this type of catheter is not available, other 22-gauge winged catheters can be substituted (e.g., Insyte-W, Becton-Dickinson, Sandy, UT). The catheters are sutured to the pinna through preformed holes in the butterfly-shaped wing using a simple injection needle and monofilament rigid suture material (Fig. 4) . In catheters without plastic wings (e.g., Angiocath, Becton-Dickinson), a butterflyshaped wing around the catheter hub can be made of a small strip of tape to permit suturing of the catheter to the ear. Otherwise, the catheter can be attached to the pinna with superglue, a roll of gauze placed inside the ear, and the catheter secured with bandage material. 92 To avoid arterial puncture or placement of the catheter into the ear artery, the artery should be identified by feeling the pulse wave, which can be difficult to detect in small and severely dehydrated calves. The artery usually is straighter and more prominent and visible than a vein before applying a torniquet around the base of the ear. Usually the ear artery in most calves runs across the pinna from medial to lateral on the border between the flat, more rigid part (cranial third) and oblique, less rigid part (caudal two thirds) of the pinna (see Fig. 4A ). The ear artery palpates harder than a vein and can be rolled under the skin of the pinna with one finger.",

Amounts calculated from blood gas analysis multiply base deficit with body weight and with a factor for the volume of distribution for bicarbonate ions in the body of 0.5 according to the following formula 68 ,87: Another reference uses a higher distribution factor for bicarbonate of 1.0 for the calculation of the bicarbonate requirements in order to consider for the ongoing daily bicarbonate losses in diarrhea,28 although this figure appears much too high to be used to correct existing deficits. Guidelines developed by Naylor 73 based on standing ability, suckling force, and age of diarrheic calves have been very useful for predicting if alkalinizing therapy is indicated and how much isotonic sodium bicarbonate should be administered; however, depressed calves without diarrhea and dehydration are often severely acidemic and therefore need intravenous buffer administration. 1, 5, 50, 52, 54, 93 Because base deficit or blood pH is normally not determined calf side, the quantity of buffer to be administered is initially estimated and reassessed on the basis of the clinical response of the calf to treatment with sodium bicarbonate. If calves do not respond to buffer therapy or their clinical condition continues to deteriorate, the presence of hypoglycemia or septicemia should be considered as differential diagnoses. 25 , 54 An easy and successful method for the treatment of severely dehydrated diarrheic and acidemic calves is to administer isotonic sodium bicarbonate solution at approximately 10% body weight over a period of 8 to 12 hours.57 Without exact calculation of base deficit, fluid rate, or maintenance requirements, this study had a success rate of therapy of 91%. 57 A total of 90 calves with a mean base deficit of -19.0\u00b13.8 mEq/ L (pH 7.06 \u00b1 0.22) received approximately 10% of their body weight as an isotonic sodium bicarbonate solution (1.26% = 12.6 giL instead of the more widely used 1.3%). The first half of the calculated dose of isotonic sodium bicarbonate solution was administered rapidly over 2 to 3 hours, which equals an administration rate of approximately 17 to 25 mL/kg/hr. When after 3 hours approximately 5% body weight of isotonic sodium bicarbonate had been infused, 77% of the calves were able to suckle again. In this study, milk replacer was continuously fed, and only water instead of electrolyte solutions was offered to the calves. Further intravenous replacement therapy with 2 to 4 L Ringer's or 0.90/0 sodium chloride after resuscitation with sodium bicarbonate was given to 16 of 90 calves. 57",

For more severely dehydrated calves, the dose rate for hydration therapy was doubled to 100 mL/kg in 4 to 6 hours with the same maintenance therapy. A practical instruction for a 45-kg, severely dehydrated and comatose calf is to give 2 L of isotonic sodium bicarbonate rapidly and then change fluids to an isotonic mixture of sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate. This mixture can be easily achieved mixing isotonic sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride solutions together. 83 A slightly hypertonic solution of 5% dextrose added to 12.6 g sodium bicarbonate can also be used. 85 The fluids administered should be warmed if a calf is hypothermic because cold fluids increase energy consumption as they are warmed by the body.88 This may further decrease cardiac output and even kill a critically ill calf, especially if a rapid infusion rate of 80 mL/kg/hr is used.73, 107 Warmed fluids cool out very fast with a slow continuous drip administration. In this case the tubing can be looped around a heat lamp or through a bucket with hot water to warm the fluids.

This deficit therapy approach may sometimes be too complicated to calculate and undertake in routine practice. It is therefore recommended to infuse only part of the total fluid requirement intravenously to resuscitate the calf and restore circulation. During a rapid infusion of the first liter of solution the calf can usually be monitored by the veterinarian and the flow rate can be adjusted. 89 In most cases, 1 to 3 L given over 2 to 3 hours partially restore fluid deficits and restore the calf's suckle reflex for further oral rehydration and buffer therapy. 57 If the suckle reflex does not return, one should look for concurrent diseases, such as hypoglycemia, septicemia, omphalitis, or pneumonia. 85",

Signs of perivenous infusion are slower infusion rate and swelling around the injection site. 40 Further catheter-related complications start with thrombosis, mostly at the catheter insertion site, and local infectious phlebitis as the most frequent complications in adult cattle. 82 This may be followed by embolism and infection of the thrombus, causing thrombophlebitis, periphlebitis, and finally septicemia. IS, 19, 41, 82 Bacterial contamination of jugular catheters occurs mostly from the microflora of the skin forming thrombi at the catheter insertion site. 82 Also, contamination of the catheter during inproper handling prior to insertion and contaminated solutions or infusion tubing results in thrombophlebitis. 2 , IS Clinical findings of infectious thrombophlebitis included a visible, painful, and warm swelling of the jugular vein, increased rectal temperature, reduced feed intake, and abnormal condition and behavior of COWS. 81 Jugular thrombophlebitis in adult cattle occurred after catheterization for 72 hours, even after surgical preparation of the skin with an iodine-based antiseptic. 81 If lowdose heparin (120 U /kg q 12 hr) was administered subcutaneously in addition to surgical skin preparation, thrombophlebitis could be avoided during catheterization for 5 days.82 Jugular catheters in large animals should be removed after 48 hours, according to an older publication, in order to avoid thrombophlebitis. 19 Auricular ear vein catheterization is believed to result in fewer problems than jugular vein catheterization. 38 , 41, 92 To the author's knowledge, a comparative evaluation of ear vein catheterization and other techniques is not available for calves; however, in pigs, ear vein catheterization for 7 to 14 days proved superior to jugular vein catheterization. 60 Jugular vein catheters were more often occluded and produced thrombosis and phlebitis, whereas ear vein catheters showed no reactions. 60 Arterial puncture is a common complication of jugular catheterization with the formation of larger and fast-growing hematomas. With ear vein catheterization, cannulation of an ear artery can be avoided by identifying this vessel as described previously. Duration of ear vein catheterization can be extended for several days without significant complications. 38 ,41 A recent study reported no serious complications with ear vein catheterization up to 96 hours.92 Changing the ear catheter is therefore not needed as frequently as with jugular catheters, but they tend to occlude more frequently than jugular catheters.92 There are no recommendations when to pull an ear catheter in calves, but in my personal experience with ear catheters in place for up to 7 days, I noticed only minor swellings and no signs of thrombophlebitis or other serious complications.",

This would avoid overhydration and pulmonary and cerebral edema. Anemia and hypoproteinemia may also follow overhydration, leading to hypoxia if the hematocrit falls below 15%. Formation of interstitial edema will occur if total protein concentration is less than 4.0 mg/ dL. 41 To the author's knowledge, these complications are not commonly reported for calves.",
