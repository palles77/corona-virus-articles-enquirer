Objective: This narrative review summarizes existing literature and experiences about the key work environment challenges reported within the critical care context and suggests best practices-implemented in hospitals or suggested by professional associations-which can be an initial step in enhancing patient care and professional recruitment and retention in our intensive care units, with particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention of an appropriately trained and satisfied workforce. The experiences are categorized for the physical, emotional, and professional environments. A case study is appended to enhance understanding of the magnitude and some of the proposed remedies of these experiences.",

In the appendix, 2 hypothetical intensive care units (ICUs) are described-one exemplifying some key work environment challenges and the second reflecting the implementation of best practicesalready in place in some hospitals or suggested by professional associations-which may address deficiencies in existing ICU work environments.

Coupled with a lack of distinct acoustic profiles for various ICU monitoring technologies, there may be a \"cry wolf effect\" [6] .

These existing space issues are further aggravated by the need to accommodate the seemingly unremitting growth of new technology in the confined bed spaces that are typical of older hospital facilities. As ICUs frequently operate with less than the minimum space recommended [12] , concern has been expressed that such examples of inappropriate unit design contribute to patient safety issues, one example is failure to meet the requirements of modern infection control guidelines. This latter issue was a significant concern in reviews of the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Canada [13] .",

The sheer number and entanglement of lines found around the bedside of a critically ill patient has the potential to elevate both the number of hospital-acquired infections and medical error. One promising approach to exploring solutions for the ICU's physical environment is through the science of human factor engineering. An ergonomically based redesign of patient care areas in the ICU, together with changes to its care delivery systems, could improve both the work environment and patient outcomes [14] . For such a redesign process to be successful, health care providers, architects, engineers, manufacturers, funders, regulators, accrediting bodies, researchers, and members of the public must work together to design convenient, safe, and functional patient care areas. A number of ICUs have done so already; we have much to learn from them. One suggestion is to work with those professional societies who represent the critical care workforce to design and disseminate solutions. Taking a leadership position in publicizing the sometimes harsh working environment of an ICU, together with a call for support of interdisciplinary research to study not only how to design new ICUs, but how to \"retrofit\" older ICUs to enhance their design in a way that is more conducive to the physical and emotional health of our critical care workforce, is something on which our critical care societies should easily agree.",

As a consequence, the ICU is often described as an emotionally charged atmosphere where life and death decisions are common and must be made with great rapidity. Intensive care units do excellent work, but, unlike in the movies, care is not always successful. Bad patient outcomes can affect providers, who are known to experience feelings of grief, fear of failure, and suppressed anger and frustration [15] . In addition, the critical care workforce must regularly balance conflicting feelings such as hope vs. realism, decisiveness vs. uncertainty, and compassion vs. professionalism. They want to be healers and dislike seeing patients and their families in distress. An additional source of stress originates from exposure to high levels of work intensity, which are typical of a busy ICU. Of particular importance is the high \"on-call\" demands and its impact on the well-being of ICU professionals, particularly medical residents and fellows. The underlying causes of \"on-call\" stress include chronic sleep deprivation, excessive, and unpredictable work loads, lack of opportunity for adequate consultation, and the need to take important decisions under excessive time constraints [16] . These could lead to various types of physical and emotional stress and were found to be associated with burnout, sick leaves, and suicidal thoughts [17] .",

Innovative initiatives to address the emotional concerns of staff may include relaxation procedures, role playing, behavioral training, and mental health promotion programs [19] . Maslacht, Schaufeli, and Leiter [20] outline a number of individual-centered interventions including assertiveness and stress inoculation training; relaxation and meditation techniques; and training in time management, interpersonal and social skills. Leaders need to encourage workers to admit, and deal with, stress rather than attempt to ignore it. Organizational approaches to dealing with on-call stress may include limiting night shifts, shortening the work period, and monitoring the symptoms of work-related stress, especially in residents and fellows. In our view, these are important and doable interventions that ICU leadership and professional societies should move toward in the future.",

The literature suggests that empowerment could be achieved through activities such as allowing the workforce more freedom in setting their work schedule, in organizing team-training programs, and in providing regular academic career development opportunities for interested staff [26] .
