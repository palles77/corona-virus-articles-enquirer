Viral replication requires the recruitment of cellular cofactors as well as the evasion of cell-intrinsic immune effectors that protect nearly every cellular niche from viral invasion. These antiviral factors, known as host restriction factors, reside in the cytoplasm, the nucleus, the plasma membrane, and the viral particle itself. The localization of restriction factors in the cell often corresponds to the step of the virus life cycle with which it interferes. For example, the nuclear dNTPase SAMHD1 depletes the pool of nucleotide triphosphates needed for viral reverse transcription (Laguette and Benkirane, 2012) , while Mx2 restricts a postentry event in the cytoplasm prior to integration (Haller, 2013) . APO-BEC3G becomes incorporated into nascent budding virions and hypermutates the viral genome (Malim and Bieniasz, 2012) . Tetherin (or BST-2) traps virions to the plasma membrane, blocking their release (Malim and Bieniasz, 2012) . Newcomers to this category of membrane-bound restriction factors are the interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins.",

            "text": "The human genome encodes at least five IFITM proteins, including three members with reported antiviral activity (IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3) (Brass et al., 2009; Diamond and Farzan, 2013; Perreira et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2014) . The antiviral IFITM proteins are nearly ubiquitously expressed and are further upregulated by type I interferons (IFN) (Siegrist et al., 2011) . IFITM5 expression is restricted to osteoblasts and is required for bone mineralization, while the function of IFITM10 is unknown (Diamond and Farzan, 2013) . Residents of cellular membranes at the interior and exterior of the cell, IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 may represent the earliest acting restriction factors yet identified. Previous reports demonstrate that they block virus entry (Brass et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2011) at the level of virus-cell fusion by affecting the biophysical properties (Desai et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013) or composition (Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al., 2013) of the cellular membranes in which they are found. These proteins display antiviral function against many enveloped viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), West Nile virus, dengue virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, hepatitis C virus, and Ebola virus (Perreira et al., 2013) . While the majority of studies have relied on in vitro infection systems, it is well established that IFITM3 restricts IAV infection in vivo. Ifitm3-deficient mice fail to clear infection by otherwise mild strains of IAV (Bailey et al., 2012; Everitt et al., 2012) , while a polymorphism in human ifitm3 is enriched in patients hospitalized for severe influenza disease (Everitt et al., 2012) . IFITM proteins have also been reported to inhibit HIV-1 replication. IFITM2 and IFITM3 impact HIV-1 entry, while IFITM1 may act by additional mechanisms (Jia et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2011) . However, the effect on HIV-1 entry is relatively modest and depends on the experimental system (Brass et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2011) . Establishing IFITM proteins as bona fide restriction factors of HIV-1, or any virus, will require the use of relevant in vitro assays, as well as an understanding of if and how the virus evades or antagonizes this activity. Furthermore, since IFITM proteins also play roles in cell adhesion, antiproliferation, and signaling (Diamond and Farzan, 2013) , it is important to identify additional functions that these proteins may perform during viral infection.",

However, increasing the viral inoculum lead to a less marked restriction ( Figure S1C ), suggesting that this antiviral effect may be partly saturable. We then assessed the ability of IFITM to impact direct viral cell-to-cell spread. We used a transient coculture system (Malbec et al., 2013; Sourisseau et al., 2007) , in which HIV-1-infected donor T cells were mixed with dye-labeled SupT1 target cells. After 2 hr of coculture, target cells were isolated using a cell sorter. Infection of target cells was assessed up to 3 days later by measuring Gag expression ( Figure 1B ). The Gag signal in targets was due to de novo synthesis, since it was significantly reduced in the presence of reverse transcriptase inhibitor Nevirapine (data not shown). In contrast to cell-free HIV-1, when infections were performed by coculture, the induction of IFITM3 in target cells had little to no effect on inhibiting virus spread ( Figure 1B ). This lack of antiviral effect was observed when donor cells were infected at different levels ( Figure 1B) . Thus, IFITM3-expressing cells are no longer protected against infection from Figure S1 ) before infection with NL4-3 HIV-1.

(F) 293T cells were transfected with pNL4-3 and FLAG-IFITM3 expression plasmids and cocultivated with SupT1 target cells expressing or not expressing IFITM3 for 2 hr. Target cells were harvested, and transmission was monitored by measuring the fraction of Gag+ target cells. Mean \u00b1 SD of four independent experiments at day 2 p.i.

Comparisons were made between the condition indicated and the IFITM3 \u00c0/\u00c0 condition. See also Figure S1 . cell-associated virus, partly because local titers using virus-producing cells are high. This led us to ask whether IFITM3 possesses other antiviral functions that are robust to this mode of HIV spread. We modified the coculture system to include conditions in which IFITM3 was induced either in infected donors, in targets, or in both ( Figure 1C ). While IFITM3 in uninfected target cells had minimal effect, IFITM3 in the donors decreased HIV transmission approximately 2-fold ( Figures 1D and 1E) . A more potent inhibition was observed when both donors and targets expressed IFITM3, which resulted in a 5-fold decrease in productive target cell infection. This unexpected role of IFITM3 was confirmed using another coculture system in which the virus does not spread in the donor cells. We cotransfected 293T cells with an HIV-1 provirus and an IFITM3-expressing plasmid and cocultured them with IFITM3-negative or -positive SupT1 cells. A 5-fold inhibition of virus transmission to target cells was observed in this system, and inhibition was further enhanced when target cells also expressed IFITM3 ( Figure 1F ). Titration of the ifitm3-encoding plasmid demonstrated that inhibition of transmission was dependent on the amount of IFITM3, while a control plasmid encoding MxA had no effect ( Figure S1D ). Together, these coculture experiments identify that HIV-1, by spreading intercellularly, escapes canonical IFITM-mediated restriction in the uninfected target cell. However, IFITM proteins potently inhibit the spread of virus from cells that are already infected.",

Infected SupT1 cells were mixed with target SupT1 cells expressing an RFP marker. Cells were then plated in microdishes coated with fibronectin and visualized by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy with images acquired every 5 min for up to 60 hr. Representative examples of viral spread, in the absence of IFITM3 or with IFITM3 expressed in both donors and targets, are shown in Movie S1. Time-lapse analysis showed that in the absence of IFITM3, HIV-1 efficiently spread to new targets, measured as double GFP+ RFP+ objects (Figures 2A and S2A ). IFITM3 significantly impaired viral propagation, with a 4-fold decrease in the number of newly infected target cells after 60 hr of continuous coculture ( Figure 2A ). As expected, an Env-defective virus (HIV-1DEnv) did not spread to new recipients (Figure 2A) , and Nevirapine abrogated viral replication (data not shown). Cells were interrogated at the end of the coculture by flow cytometry to confirm the effect of IFITM3 on viral spread ( Figure S2B ). We then visually scored the appearance of syncytia, identified as giant GFP+RFP+ cells eventually displaying bubble-like membrane extensions ( Figure 2C ). IFITM3 strongly decreased the number of syncytia observed, a phenomenon previously attributed to IFITM proteins in the context of other viruses (Li et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013) (Figures 2B and 2C) . Image extraction at different time points demonstrated that in the presence of IFITM3, infected donor GFP+ cells formed clusters with target RFP+ cells, but in most cases these structures did not lead to cell fusion ( Figures 2B  and 2C) . We also performed a time-lapse microscopy analysis of viral spread when IFITM3 was induced in donors or in targets alone. The main antiviral effect was observed when IFITM3 was present in the donor cells ( Figure S2C ). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of IFITM3 on HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission is associated with a significant decrease of fusion between infected and target cells, suggesting a decrease in virus production from infected cells and/or a defect in the fusion capacity of membranes present at cell-cell contacts.",

The expression of all three proteins was upregulated by type I IFN ( Figure 4A ). Furthermore, endogenous IFITM2/3 is incorporated into virions produced from HeLa cells, but not from 293T cells, which express only trace amounts of IFITM proteins (Figures S4B and S4C) . We thus silenced the three ifitm genes by siRNA in type I IFN-treated cells ( Figure 4A ). These cells were infected with VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1, and their ability to transmit infection was assessed by performing a coculture with SupT1 target cells. Knockdown of endogenous IFITM proteins resulted in a 2-to 3fold increase in virus transmission to targets ( Figure 4B ) and the production of virions that were 3-fold more infectious ( Figure 4C ).

As IFITM residing in endosomal membranes block the entry of many viruses at the stage of fusion, we predicted that IFITM localized to the viral membrane would have similar effects. To quantify HIV-1 entry, we used a virion fusion assay, which allows the discrimination between viral entry into the cytoplasm and endosomal capture These cells were adjusted for Gag+ levels and mixed with target SupT1-actin-mRFP cells, expressing or not expressing IFITM3. Images were taken every 5 min for 60 hr. The area of GFP and RFP colocalized pixels was quantified and used as a marker of target cell infection. Six fields in two independent experiments were analyzed and plotted as mean \u00b1 SEM. See Movie S1 for a representative time-lapse and Figure S2 for flow cytometry analysis of the experiment. (B) Clearly identifiable, oversized infected cells were considered as syncytia and visually scored at the indicated time points. Six fields in two experiments were analyzed and plotted as mean \u00b1 SEM. (C) Images extracted from Movie S1 were extracted at the indicated time points and centered on a cell cluster. White arrows indicate examples of syncytia. Mann-Whitney test, *p < 0.05. See also Movie S1 and Figure S2 . (Cavrois et al., 2002; Roesch et al., 2012) . This assay relies on the use of viruses containing a b-lactamase-Vpr (blam-Vpr) protein chimera. The cytoplasmic access of blam-Vpr as a result of fusion, after 2 hr of infection, is monitored by the enzymatic cleavage of CCF2-AM, a fluorogenic substrate of b-lactamase loaded in target cells. A typical experiment showed that virions produced in the presence of IFITM3 exhibited a marked defect for fusion with recipient SupT1 lymphocytes ( Figure 5A ). As a negative control, HIV encoding fusion-defective Env (HIV-1 Gag p24 antigen levels in the supernatants measured by ELISA. Gag MFI and p24 levels in the absence of IFITM3 were normalized to 100%. Mean \u00b1 SD of five independent experiments is shown. (C) Viral supernatants from IFITM3 positive and negative SupT1 cells were tested for infectivity. Viral particles were purified, and the inoculum (adjusted for 25 ng p24) was added to fresh SupT1 cells. Infection was assessed by measuring the fraction of Gag+ cells after 2 days. Infection in the absence of IFITM3 was normalized to 100%. Mean \u00b1 SD of four independent experiments is shown (see also Figure S3A for infectivity assay on HeLa-CD4 cells). (D) Viral particles from FLAG-IFITM3 positive and negative SupT1 cells were purified by a double ultracentrifugation on cushions of sucrose and Optiprep and analyzed by western blot. One representative experiment is shown, with 25 ng of p24 loaded in each lane and probed with anti-FLAG. (E) 293T cells were cotransfected with a pNL4-3 provirus and with increasing doses of FLAG-IFITM3 expression plasmid. Viral particles released in supernatants were harvested, and infectivity was assessed on HeLa-CD4 cells, with 100% corresponding to virions produced without IFITM3. Mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments is shown. MxA expression plasmid was used as a control. Levels of IFITM3 in 293T cell lysates and purified virions are shown in the lower panels. (F) Purified virus particles, produced in 293T cells cotransfected with pNL4-3 and either IFITM3-FLAG or control plasmid, were fixed and immunogold labeled with anti-FLAG.

The three proteins were individually incorporated into particles ( Figure S5A ), and all decreased viral fusion to different extents ( Figure S5B ). IFITM3 was the most potent, while IFITM1 and IFITM2 imposed a restriction of approximately 2-fold. An untagged version of IFITM3 displayed a similar capacity to block virion fusion ( Figure S5C ).",

Therefore, we tested how virion-incorporated IFITM3 compares with cellular IFITM3 with regards to blocking virus fusion by performing the fusion assay using SupT1 target cells expressing or not expressing IFITM3 ( Figure 5D ). An effect of IFITM3 in target cells was observed only when low doses of virus were used, confirming that restriction in the recipient lymphocyte is modest ( Figure 5D ). In contrast, the fusion of virus containing IFITM3 was strongly restricted, regardless of the viral inoculum used ( Figure 5D ). This effect was even greater when both virions and cellular membranes were expressing IFITM3. Thus, the effect of IFITM3 in target cells is saturable and exerts a relatively weak block to virus entry compared to the activity of virion-incorporated IFITM3. These results strongly suggest that IFITM proteins are dramatically more effective at restricting virus-cell fusion when localized to the viral membrane.",

However, IFITM proteins limit the spread of virus from infected cells, at least in part by rendering virions less infectious and less fusogenic. Interestingly, while IFITM3 in uninfected lymphocytes has a minimal protective effect against HIV-1, it serves an additive antiviral role when IFITM3 is also present within incoming virions. The reason for this may lie with the accepted mechanism by which IFITM proteins inhibit the fusion capacity of membranes in which they reside. IFITM proteins inhibit steps leading to the formation of a fusion pore by increasing the curvature of cell membranes and reducing their fluidity (Desai et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013) . If IFITM3 similarly contorts the viral membrane and causes similar biophysical consequences (Everitt et al., 2012) then the apposition of two IFITM3-containing membranes may make virus-cell fusion even more unlikely. Alternatively, IFITM incorporation into viral membranes may indirectly affect fusogenicity by excluding factors necessary for virus-cell fusion or by recruiting other inhibitors of this process. For example, while we did not detect differences in Env glycoprotein levels in virions containing or not containing IFITM3, Env conformation may be compromised. Although unlikely, this hypothesis deserves further investigation.",

            "text": "Despite that IFITM proteins may be localized to different cellular compartments in the absence of infection, with IFITM1 residing primarily at the plasma membrane (John et al., Mudhasani et al., 2013) and IFITM2 and IFITM3 residing in late endosomes and lysosomes (Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al., Feeley et al., 2011; Weston et al., 2014) , we detect all of them in HIV-1 virions. This could be explained by the fact that all IFITM proteins transit, at least transiently, to the cell surface following translation (Chesarino et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2014; Weston et al., 2014) . HIV-1 virion assembly is thought to occur primarily at the plasma membrane but may also occur in an intracellular compartment connected to the surface in some cell types, such as macrophages (Deneka et al., 2007; Jouve et al., 2007; Sundquist and Kr\u00e4 usslich, 2012; Welsch et al., 2007) . Our confocal microscopy analysis of primary infected lymphocytes demonstrated a colocalization of IFITM proteins with viral proteins Env and (to a lesser extent) Gag. Targeting to lipid rafts, which have been shown to harbor IFITM1 (Perreira et al., 2013) , is important for optimal virus release (Tang et al., 2009) . Therefore, there are numerous potential meeting sites for the virus and IFITM within infected cells. Our time-lapse analysis of cell-to-cell transmission demonstrated a striking diminution of syncytia formation between IFITM3-expressing cells. Syncytia are likely the consequence of fusion events occurring at the plasma membrane. This further suggests that the surface of the productively infected cell is the main site at which IFITM3 exerts this antiviral function. We also observed an increase in cell surface-associated IFITM2/3 following IFN treatment. This complements published data indicating that IFN treatment or overexpression modifies IFITM localization (Brass et al., 2009; Perreira et al., 2013) . Further work will aid in our understanding of how HIV-1 impacts IFITM localization. Interestingly, we showed here that Env is not required for IFITM3 incorporation into virions. Addressing the passive or active nature of IFITM association with virions will require the identification of virus strains or mutants that exhibit differential sensitivity to IFITM virion infiltration. Such differences, if they should exist, may lie in different strategies used by viruses to assemble and egress from the infected cell.",

The trafficking and localization of IFITM is regulated by sorting motifs within the N-terminal intracytoplasmic domain and by palmitoylated cysteine residues (Ding et al., 2014; Yount et al., 2010) . IFITM function is also regulated by phosphorylation (Chesarino et al., 2014) . It will be worthwhile to use various IFITM mutants to determine precisely where and how these proteins are incorporated into viral particles. We show here that IFITM proteins are expressed and upregulated by type I IFN in primary T lymphocytes and in DCs, two natural targets of HIV-1 in vivo. In these cells, as well as in macrophages, viral entry, budding, and egress pathways display notable differences. Further work will address the cell-type specificity of this restriction activity of IFITM.",

            "text": "Apart from our finding that IFITM proteins become incorporated into virus particles and decrease particle infectivity, we also observed that ectopic IFITM expression slightly decreases viral production. The presence of IFITM3 in infected SupT1 T cells or in transfected 293T cells resulted in modest decreases in HIV-1 Gag expression, consistent with articles reporting similar findings in these two cell types (Chutiwitoonchai et al., 2013; Ding et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2011) . However, by introducing limiting amounts of IFITM3 in 293T, we observed an inhibition of virus transmission without affecting viral production. Therefore, we believe that the block in virus transmission conferred by IFITM3 is primarily the result of decreased viral infectivity and fusogenicity. It will also be worth determining whether IFITM proteins accumulate at or modify the formation of virological synapses between infected and uninfected T cells. Now that we have expanded our understanding of how IFITM proteins contribute to intrinsic immunity, it will be important to study these functions in the context of other enveloped viruses. This analysis may reveal whether viruses sensitive to IFITM in the target cell are also susceptible to this donor cellspecific mode of antiviral function, i.e., virion incorporation and decreased infectivity. Furthermore, it will be important to address whether viruses previously described as IFITM-resistant (murine leukemia virus, arenaviruses) are in fact sensitive to this mode of inhibition. Furthermore, future experiments will require attention to the virus-producing cell type, especially the combination of donor and target cells used in experiments. Since IFITM proteins are known to form homo-and heteromultimers, and these interactions are necessary for full antiviral activity (John et al., 2013) , combinatorial approaches must be employed to study their collective activity, in both the cell and the virion. Together, these approaches will reveal the full breadth and potency of IFITM proteins.",

Another nonspecific strategy to evade IFITM3 restriction has been described for IAV (Wang et al., 2014) , but no direct anti-IFITM3 activity has thus far been identified for any virus. A growing list of viruses has evolved mechanisms to antagonize or degrade various cellular proteins, which offers additional support in favor of their classification as restriction factors (Duggal and Emerman, 2012) . The use of HIV-1 mutants carrying mutations in viral accessory or structural genes, as well as IFITM variants containing synthetic or naturally occurring polymorphisms, will reveal potential interactions between HIV-1 and IFITM proteins and their consequences on infection. Furthermore, extending the functional characterization of IFITM proteins beyond humans will allow us to assess whether sequence divergence across taxa may play a role in cross-species virus transmission events.",
