So far they have received scant mutual theoretical discussions, despite enjoying widespread attention and empirical support. Both One Health and EcoHealth are conceptual movements, scientific areas, and political endeavours.

In contrast, the EcoHealth concept is defined as an ecosystem approach to health, tending to focus on environmental and socioeconomic issues and initially designed by disease ecologists working in the field of biodiversity conservation. This concept results from the hybridization of different approaches and thematic fields: conservation medicine, disease ecology, and the framework developed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (1) . This vision led to the notion of ecosystemic services linked to health and welfare, integrating social and citizen dimensions. From a socio-political perspective, EcoHealth and One Health refer to two different regimes of health governance. Public health policy studies converge in considering two regimes in health governance: 'international health' and 'global health' (2, 3) . EcoHealth is related to the international health regime, as One Health is linked to global health. The field of One Health is evolving on a large scale and at official levels, whereas EcoHealth operates at a more grass-root, pragmatic level. The One Health approach is driven by international standards institutions (OIE, FAO, WHO) and is supported and recognized by the donor community. The EcoHealth paradigm, however, takes a broader view of health and links public health to natural resource management within an ecosystem approach to human health. EcoHealth is seen by several scientists as a One Health approach which optimizes interdisciplinarity including strong participatory and citizenship components.",

Both are motivated by the conviction that health concerns must be addressed at the human\u00c1animal interface within their broader natural and social environments (i.e. socio-ecosystem approach). Both try to integrate scientific disciplines combining multi-and cross-disciplinary approaches. Both aim to mitigate the risks threatening ecosystems and public health, including veterinary public health. Both deal with the complexity of diseases and health (4) . Finally, both struggle to properly define the boundaries of their paradigms despite their apparent similarities regarding principles and objectives. There are concerns about the risk of instrumentalisation of the socio-ecological aspects (conservation, ecosystemic approaches) by the medical sector. Thus, the health sector could use the 'politically correct' discourse of One Health but without in effect changing its practices of leadership and funding opportunities regarding environment and ecosystem approaches to health.",

            "text": "Health professionals and researchers perceive the paradigms differently. For academics, both paradigms can be applied to inter-and trans-disciplinary frameworks for research activities on zoonotic diseases or health matters and/or are viewed as research topics (e.g. efficacy and efficiency of One Health). Zinsstag (5) , who distinctly applies One Health and EcoHealth according to a given health issue or disease, suggests they should converge in the areas of zoonoses, disease emergence, and pandemic threats. Barrett and Bouley (6) examined the potential benefits from collaboration between One Health and EcoHealth. For Ngyuen-Viet et al. (7), EcoHealth is progressively converging with the One Health paradigm and suggests combining the two paradigms. For health professionals, policy-and decision-makers, both paradigms, but especially One Health, have underpinned official cooperation among sectors for food safety and public health improvement, mostly in developing countries in Africa and Southeast Asia. But a better connection between the two spheres is needed. Leung et al. (8) emphasise the decisive function of governance and partnerships for the development of holistic tactics: 'Further research on governance and partnership models, as well as systems-based organizational working practices, is needed to close the gap between One Health and EcoHealth theory and public health practice'. However, until now, despite these calls from the scientific community, both concepts have failed to converge from an institutional viewpoint. The ideology behind both concepts being globally similar, hidden interests or sectorial deadlocks must be preventing closer integration. Crosssectorial and interdisciplinary scientific collaboration on analysis, modelling, and risk management will allow joint development of decision support tools to help implement integrated health strategies and policies. Several authors have emphasised the lack of certain key components for the One Health paradigm: social sciences have remained marginalized (9), the wildlife component and its associated thematic fields in ecology are frequently a neglected element (10) , and the environmental component remains underrepresented (6) .",

In Madagascar, the research platform 'Forests and Biodiversity' (www.forets-biodiv.org) aims at combining biodiversity conservation and the enhancement of natural resources to ensure the resilience of socio-ecosystems. Some activities aim at exploring the links between the restoration of forest ecosystem functions (e.g. through the reintroduction of key-stone species) including a hypothetised improved ecosystem resilience with health indicators for both animal and human populations. Such health indicators can contribute in return to the monitoring of ecosystem functioning among other ecological indicators. For example, in the case of bushpigs, the relationship between bushmeat culture and practices that provide safety nets for local communities (e.g. the huge impact of African swine fever on domestic pig populations) demonstrate how health situations can be the catalyst for actor concerns and at the same time the whistle blower of non-linear dysfunctioning within the socio-ecosystem. . In Southeast Asia, GREASE (www.grease-net work.org) is a regional network to support research activities for better health risk management at the animal, human, and environment interface. It responds to the challenge of animal and zoonotic diseases and public health through a theoretical and operational framework. GREASE provides scientific and institutional support to facilitate interactions between various stakeholders, including scientists from Southeast Asia and worldwide, policy-and decision-makers (national veterinary services and institutes, international agencies, i.e. OIE, FAO, WHO), and local actors (farmers, value chain operators, local authorities, NGOs, community representatives). Research and development projects allow for work on holistic approaches: One Health surveillance (REVASIA programme and zoonotic influenza in Cambodia); EcoHealth and One Health case studies in the framework of the EuropeAid ComAcross project (www.one healthsea.org/comacross) on the health impact of water and waste management, zoonotic encephalitis involving wildlife (i.e. Nipah virus) and livestock (Japanese encephalitis) and neglected zoonoses impacting family farmers; rodent-borne diseases (www.biodivhealthsea.org/); and participatory One Health modelling at the field level (Regional EU-ASEAN Dialogue, www.bit.ly/ 1MK7U5W). . In southern Africa, the research platform 'Production and Conservation in Partnership' (RP-PCP: www.rp-pcp.org) promotes the sustainable coexistence between agricultural production and the conservation of natural resources in the complex socio-ecosystems presented by the Transfrontier Conservation Areas. The RP-PCP aims to contribute to sustainable development, nature conservation, and improved rural livelihoods through strengthening national research capacities, multidisciplinary approaches, and institutional partnerships. 'Health and Environment' is one of the four pillars of the platform that allows ecosystem approaches to (animal and human) health and that contributes to the global objective of improving conservation and development in these socioecosystems. Research activities focus on livestock diseases linked to production and markets at various scales (e.g. tick-borne diseases or foot and mouth disease); on neglected zoonoses such as bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, or rift valley fever; or on diseases potentially detrimental to wildlife populations (e.g. bovine tuberculosis, anthrax). The human\u00c1livestock\u00c1wildlife interface is central to all the research activities on health and other thematics which implies One Heath and EcoHealth approaches.",

These components are critical drivers of health operating at different scales, and their integration into all-inclusive studies could facilitate the unification of the two paradigms. Human and social sciences and modelling approaches are increasingly associated with the field studies carried out in these three sites in order to improve health of vulnerable populations exposed to diseases and to manage animal and public health. Furthermore, social sciences and modelling could act as catalysts to merge the two paradigms and empower local and national authorities within a cross-sectorial scheme.",

Such diseases do not fit 'traditional One Health topics' linked to previous experience of emerging zoonotic diseases within global health governance schemes (which One Health paradigm is actually rooted in). Such topics call for global governance schemes such as One Health and for holistic and integrated approach to health. It allows emphasising local context importance (both from an environmental and socio-economic perspective), participation, and multi-level governance. We suggest conducting investigations on proposals that need to be addressed at diverse scales using a blend of biological and social disciplines at the junction between the environmental, social, medical, and animal science sectors. Among others, we propose to tackle the following topics (Box 2). Box 2. Relevant topics for considering the convergences among One Health and EcoHealth",

Despite the fact that One Health and EcoHealth have been largely competing for funds and institutional/political acknowledgement, new health issues emerging at the animal\u00c1human\u00c1environment interface are rising new stakes, needing new types of collaboration, and scientific highlights.
