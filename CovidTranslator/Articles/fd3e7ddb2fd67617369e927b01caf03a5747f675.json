Coronaviruses are another group of viruses that cause widespread respiratory infections and thus should be included in the TR-FIA battery for rapid viral diagnosis. Of the four recognized human coronavirus strains, only two have been characterized, and both are associated with upper and occasionally lower respiratory tract disease. IFA and EIA tests for these strains, called human coronavirus (HCV) 229E and HCV-OC43, have been described and applied to epidemiologic surveys with good success (McIntosh et al., 1978; Isaacs et al., 1983; Macnaughton et al., 1983) . In the present report, we describe the production of monoclonal antibodies to HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 and describe their use in IFA, EIA, and TR-FIA, with emphasis on the TR-FIA as a highly-sensitive rapid antigen test.",

Antigen was diluted in TR-FIA antigen diluent; incubation was 1.5 h, 37\u00b0C.

All of the polyclonal 229E tests had relatively high backgrounds which were lowered only slightly by the addition of normal goat serum to the detector side of the formats. Thus, the optimal 229E test with guinea pig capture antibody gave mean OD values of 1.466 with 229E cultures, 0.214 with OC43 cultures, and 0.212 with negative cell controls in the presence of 2% normal goat serum; the mean P/N was 7. None of the OC43 tests were improved by addition of any normal serum to the detector antibodies; thus, the OC43 test with mouse capture antibody gave similar positive OD values (1.402/0.034); the mean P/N ratio was 41, and the test was as type-specific as the 229E test. These results show that for both viruses as cell culture supernatants the all-monoclonal format was more sensitive than the polyclonal test in antigen detection.

For 229E, the comparative evaluation included 13 229E-positive specimens, 10 OC43-positive specimens, and 10-20 negative specimens. Seven negative specimens were positive for adenovirus, RSV, or parainfluenza types 1 and 3 and thus were important controls in the study; the remaining specimens were negative for any recognized virus by culture and TR-FIA. All specimens were tested at 1:10 dilution in the specimen diluent. None of the negative specimens were positive by any of the three tests, but several positive specimens failed to be detected by the EIA tests. In all of these cases, the absorbance values were slightly below the EIA cutoff value. The 5 specimens (4 229E, 1 OC43) which were not detected in the monoclonal EIAs were also not detected in the respective polyclonal EIAs, and furthermore were minimally positive in TR-FIA, suggesting that these specimens had deteriorated to the point where the EIA tests were not sufficiently sensitive to detect the viruses.",

These tests detected virus in 69% of 229E-and 90% of OC43-positive clinical specimens, respectively. The TR-FIA, on the other hand, detected virus in 100% of 229E-and 100% of OC43-containing specimens. These detection rates may change with additional experience with the formatted tests, because the numbers of original specimens that were known EIA-positive and were available for testing were too low for an accurate determination; we have no culture-positive coronavirus specimens owing to the extreme lability of these viruses.",

The anti-N antibodies of HCV-OC43 also did not exhibit HI activity, which resides in the peplomers; HCV-229E does not possess HA activity, and thus the 229E antibodies could not be tested for HI titers (Hierholzer et al., 1981) . Anti-N monoclonals, in addition to anti-E1 (envelope) and anti-E2 (peplomer) antibodies, were type-specific in other studies as well (Arlene Collins and Ernesto DeNardin, SUNY, Buffalo NY, personal communication, 1987; Fleming et al., 1988) . Furthermore, probes and PCR primers based on the N gene sequences of 229E and OC43 have also been successfully used in type-specific diagnostic tests (Kamahora et al., 1989; Myint et al., 1989 Myint et al., , 1990 Stewart et al., 1992) .
