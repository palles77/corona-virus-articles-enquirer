Therefore, Enping was considered as the most threaten area by ZIKV in Guangdong, China due to high incidence of importation of zika cases.

Local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staff contacted these travelers at the time of their arrival in Enping County by phone or household visits.

In addition, the mutation rates of second nucleotide of each codon within the open reading frame (ORF) of the HA gene was 0.188 during 2015-2016, but the rates were 0.454 during 2017-2018, which confirmed that the mutation rates had doubled ( Table 1 ) . Interestingly, most of the H3N2 subtypes of AIVs belonged to the Eurasion lineage and contained six potential N-glycosylation sites, including positions 24 NST 26 , 38 NGT 40 , 2.393 2.507 * HPD: highest probability density. * Position: the three nucleotides of each codon.

Strikingly, the codon of amino acids at position 24 had a one nucleotide (AAC) difference from the nucleotide (AGC) that leads to the mutation of 24N \u2192 S. This might have been related to the mutation rates of second nucleotide of each codon doubling with time, thereby changing the N-glycosylation sites of F138 and F352, which indicated viral replication and adaptation of H3N2 subtypes AIVs might have evolved substantially in the hosts.",

Our findings revealed that the HA and NA gene of F138 and F352 reassortant with the H3N2, H3N3, H4N2, H6N2 subtypes AIVs and the mean rates of second nucleotide of each codon of the HA gene had doubled. However, although the mean rates of the HA and NA gene nucleotide substitutions decreased, the reassortant process might have been affected by the frequent changes in antigenicity of other prevalent AIV strains so that better conditions are needed for the reassortant process in H3N2 subtypes of AIVs to proceed. In addition, consistent with Gao' research, 9 the binding affinity for the \u03b1(2-3)-linked sialic acid receptor of H7N9 subtype AIVs in 2013 was decreased, mainly due to the lack of N-glycosylation sites at amino acid position 150 in the HA protein. The H3N2 influenza virus has a wide host range and new N-glycosylation sites of F138 and F352 have been found, indicating that the H3N2 subtype AIVs might have attempted to adapt to different hosts. Importantly, H5N1 and H7N9 subtype AIVs have adapted to mammals and now pose a public health concern to mammals and humans. Hence, ongoing surveillance of H3N2 subtypes of AIVs in birds is warranted.",

NGS is a novel method to DNA/RNA sequencing. Due to its high-throughput capacity and fast turnover time, NGS technology has been widely applied to the field of medical microbiology in recent years. NGS has been reported in the application for pathogen detection from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue and intraoperative samples. [2] [3] [4] However, no studies have been reported from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients with immuno- suppression. Compared with the immunocompetent host, CAP can be potentially fatal and present significant challenges in immunocompromised host (ICH). In addition to common pathogens, some unusual organisms can cause severe infection in ICH. Besides, multiple concurrent infections are also common in ICH. 5 These characteristics pose a severe challenge to establish a specific diagnosis to guide therapy. A diagnostic tool should be pursued aggressively for favorable outcomes in this population. We recently explored the utility of NGS of bronchoalveolar lavage on the diagnosis of pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. Thirteen immunocompromised patients with a diagnosis of communty-acquired pneumonia (CAP) were recruited from critical care department of Shanghai Ruijin Hospital. The diagnosis of CAP is based on the presence of select clinical features (e.g., cough, fever, sputum production, and pleuritic chest pain) and is supported by imaging of the lung, usually by chest radiography. Immunosuppression, defined as chemotherapy or neutropenia < 10 0 0 \u03bcL during the past 28 days; treatment \u2265 20 mg corticosteroids daily for \u2265 14 days; human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunosuppressive therapy after organ or bone marrow transplantation; and active tuberculosis. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed under local anesthesia with topical lidocaine for patients. BALF specimens using three aliquots of 20 mL of 0.9% saline were obtained. The first was discarded as recommended. The others were pooled and separated into two aliquots. One aliquot was sent to the microbiology lab for direct examination with Gram stain and culture. The other one was sent for DNA extraction and sequencing.",

Song reported cross-species transmission of an intact avian influenza virus (H3N2) to dogs in South Korea that caused acute respiratory disease. 5 In addition, seasonal influenza viruses of strain H3N2 have circulated in the human population every year, and sequence analysis has shown that the novel H3N2 contains genes from H7N3 and H7N7 that viruses are closely related to the H7N9 virus, suggesting that reassortment occurred between H3N2 and other influenza virus subtypes. 6 Thus, evolution of H3N2 AIVs was demonstrated in this study.Two influenza A(H3N2) virus-positive isolates, A/duck/ Guangdong/F138/2017(H3N2) and A/duck/Guangdong/F352/2018 (H3N2) (hereafter F138, F352), were collected from live poultry markets in Guangdong province during November 2017-March 2018. Molecular characterization of the two H3N2 isolates confirmed an amino acid HA-226Q, HA-228 G (H3 numbering), NA-292R (N2 numbering) and motif PEKQTR \u2193 GL at its HA-cleavage site, which was the characteristic of low-pathogenic AIVs. Moreover, these strains were susceptible for NA inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir). The detailed information of two H3N2 isolates were shown in Supplementary Table 1 .Available reference sequences, including those of avianorigin, canine-origin, swine and human-origin of the H3N2 subtype used for phylogenetic analysis, were acquired from GenBank ( http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ ) and GISAID ( http://platform.gisaid.org/ ), and phylogenetic trees of all sequences were prepared by the Bayesian method using MrBayes version 3.2.6. Preliminary analyses were conducted to estimate the best-fit nucleotide substitution model using MrModeltest version 2.3. 7 Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the HA and NA genes of F138 and F352 belonged to the avian-Eurasion lineage and were not related to canine, swine or human influenza viruses ( Fig. 1 A and B) . The HA segments of F138 and F352 showed ",
