            "text": "Recent intriguing findings from genetic linkage, knockout, and physiologic studies in mice and rats led us to conduct the first investigation of the novel angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 gene (ACE2) in human hypertension (HT). We genotyped four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (A3 G at nucleotide 1075 in intron 1, G3 A at nucleotide 8790 in intron 3, C3 G at nucleotide 28330 in intron 11, and G3 C at nucleotide 36787 in intron 16) in HT (n \u03ed 152) and normotensive (NT, n \u03ed 193) groups having inherently high biological power (\u03fe80%) due to our inclusion only of subjects whose parents had the same BP status as themselves. The SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium (D\u0408 \u03ed 54% to 100%, P \u03ed .05 to 0.0001). Because ACE2 is on the X chromosome, data for each sex were analyzed separately. Minor allele frequencies in HT versus NT were as follows: for the intron 1 variant 0.21 versus 0.17 in female subjects (P \u03ed .31) and 0.25 versus 0.29 in male subjects (P \u03ed .60); intron 3 variant 0.22 versus 0.18 in female subjects (P \u03ed .35) and 0.15 versus 0.20 in male subjects (P \u03ed .47); intron 11 variant 0.39 versus 0.46 in male subjects (P \u03ed 0.17) and 0.31 versus 0.30 in male subjects (P \u03ed .96); intron 16 variant 0.20 versus 0.19 in female subjects (P \u03ed .72) and 0.17 versus 0.17 in male subjects (P \u03ed .95). Haplotype analysis was also negative. These data provide little support for ACE2 in genetic predisposition to HT. Am J Hypertens 2004;17: 624 -628 ",

            "text": "M any association studies of renin-angiotensin system gene variants have been conducted in essential hypertension. In the case of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme gene (ACE), despite occasional reports of a possible role the ACE locus in blood pressure (BP) variation 1 or association with hypertension (HT), 2,3 by far the majority of studies have been negative. 4 -9 Recently, a homologue, ACE2, 10, 11 has been discovered, whose catalytic domain is 42% identical with ACE. 11 Whereas ACE is expressed ubiquitously in the vasculature, ACE2 is expressed predominantly in the kidney, 10, 11 but also in cardiovascular and gastrointestinal 12 tissues. Notably ACE2 cleaves a single residue from angiotensin I (Ang I) to generate angiotensin 1-9 (Ang 1-9), which has no known function. Angiotensin 1-9 cannot be converted to Ang II by ACE2, but can be converted by ACE to Ang 1-7, a vasodilator. 11 Angiotensin 1-7 can also be generated directly from Ang I by endopeptidases other than ACE2 and ACE, including neprilsyn, prolyl endopepti-dase, and thimet oligopeptidase. 13 In contrast to ACE, ACE2 does not hydrolyze bradykinin, 14 nor is it inhibited by typical ACE inhibitors. 10, 15 Moreover, ACE2 is clearly multifunctional, having been reported recently to be the functional receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. 16 It has been suggested that ACE2 might negatively regulate the activated renin-angiotensin system by diverting the generation of vasoconstrictor Ang II towards the inactive Ang 1-9 and vasodilatatory Ang 1-7 peptides. 17 Competition between ACE and ACE2 for the same substrate, Ang I, could thereby serve a counterbalancing function.",

Our study design (using the offspring of two HT parents) meant that the subjects with HT used were drawn from a general hypertensive population (\u03f31520 individuals) that was 10 times greater than the number of subjects studied. 6 Such a study design also leads to a considerable reduction in sample size requirements for detection of the same population effect of genetic variants (W.Y.S. Wang, unpublished observation). For example, assuming a multiplicative effect of alleles and the absence of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, in the case of an autosomal disease allele with population frequency of 0.20 that contributes to HT with a disease odds ratio of 1.5, sampling based on disease status alone would require at least 267 case subjects and control subjects to provide 80% power for a significant threshold of P \u03ed .05; however, when considering the disease status of both parents as being affected, only 64 samples might be required in each group to detect the same effect. The reason for this is the disease allele frequency of the specially sampled case subjects would be higher than that of their affected parents. The opposite is true for the control subjects. Therefore, despite having the same underlying effect in the population, the disease odds ratio between the two selected groups is increased. As a practical demonstration of increased power when sampling is based on family history of HT, we reanalyzed data in one of our reports 20 using a test for trend that allows the expectation for increased risks in different groups, that is, subjects with HT with two HT parents should have more genetic risk than subjects with HT with only one HT parent. This gave a P value of .0066, as can be seen below: 2 (1) for trend \u03ed 7.4, pr \u03fe 2 \u03ed 0.0066 Despite finding no association of ACE2 variants with HT, we did, however, note higher diastolic BP for the G allele of the intron 1 SNP in lean male subjects with HT .059 m and higher systolic BP for the A allele of the intron 3 SNP in obese male subjects with HT. These were nonetheless weak and became nonsignificant after correction for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni method. The latter is regarded as overly severe, thus risking the elimination of a true positive finding. 23 The physiologic function of ACE2 is still being unraveled. As well as the effects described earlier, Ace2 knockout mice exhibit cardiac abnormalities 18 resembling cardiac stunning (reversible decline in cardiac contractility under ischemic conditions) in humans. 24 Loss of Ace2 is also associated with upregulation of hypoxia-inducible genes, 18 suggesting a possible role for ACE2 in response to cardiac ischemia. 24 As well, Ang II is increased and could contribute to cardiac dysfunction via induction of oxidative stress unrelated to BP. Elevated Ang II could be blunted by compensatory changes in Ang 1-7, kinin metabolites, the apelin system, 17 or nitric oxide. 25 In conclusion, the present study provides no evidence for an association of ACE2 polymorphisms with essential HT in an Anglo-Celtic Australian population. However, this does not totally exclude a role for ACE2 in the causation of essential HT. The testing of additional polymorphisms in ACE2 and association analyses in other settings and ethnic groups is needed before eliminating ACE2 completely. A role in heart failure and coronary artery disease also remain to be examined.",
