A wide range of pathogens are recognised as causative agents of pneumonia, but 14-23% of cases remain aetiologically undiagnosed, despite continuing optimisation of diagnostic tests for the detection of respiratory pathogens [2, 3] . Different methods have been developed for the identification of unsuspected, new and divergent pathogens. In recent years, these techniques have led to the discovery of several viruses in respiratory specimens, including human metapneumovirus, bocavirus, WU and KI polyomaviruses, and torque teno virus (TTV) [4] . Some of these have been confirmed subsequently as causative agents of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), but the involvement of most of these viruses remains a widely debated issue. TTV belongs to the recently created viral family Anelloviridae, composed of single-stranded circular DNA viruses, such as TTV (Alphatorquevirus), torque teno midi virus (Gammatorquevirus) and torque teno mini virus (TTMV) (Betatorquevirus) [5] .",

As the respiratory tract is thought to be a site of primary infection and continual replication of TTV [7] , we conducted further investigations to evaluate to what extent these new viruses may be associated with the pathology.

[8] and based on the cloning and sequencing of random RT-PCR products. ''Homebrew'' sequence analysis software was used to identify new or divergent sequences from those deposited in databases. Three out of five samples harbouring fragments of TTMV sequences were subjected to TTMV full-length genome amplification by inverse PCR with back-to-back TTMV-LY-9F and TTMV-LY-8R primers (table 1) . Amplicons were cloned and sequenced through both strands. Using the MEGA5 programme (http://megasoftware.net/mega.php), multiple alignments were generated by ClustalW (www. clustal.org/omega), and phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbour-joining method. Predictive secondary structures were modelled with RNA structure 4. Cell culture and TTMV transfection or infection Two cell lines were used to study the replication of these new isolates of TTMV: the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cell line and A549 alveolar epithelial cell line (both from CelluloNet, UMS3444/US8 Biosciences Gerland-Lyon Sud, Lyon, France). HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics, while A549 cells were maintained in F12K medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics. Cloned TTMV DNA was linearised with EcoRV and BamHI on 12-well plates) with JetPEI reagent (PolyPlus-transfection, Illkirch, France) as recommended by the manufacturer. Controls included transfection with vector alone or cells transfected with JetPEI alone. Transfected cultures were incubated overnight at 37uC and 5% carbon dioxide. After 18 h, cells were washed three times with PBS before adding fresh medium. The transfection efficiencies were optimised with a reporter plasmid. For the infection studies, healthy cells, seeded in 24-well plates, were infected with the supernatants of TTMV DNA-transfected cells that had been harvested 3 days post-transfection, and incubated at 37uC and 5% carbon dioxide for 2 h, 7 h and 24 h.

Cells were harvested in 2 mL of NucliSENS lysis buffer (bioM\u00e9rieux) for the extraction of nucleic acids with easyMAG and eluted in 100 mL of elution buffer. Total cellular DNA was then digested with DpnI or NdeII, which cut the dam-methylated GATC-sites of input TTMV and the nonmethylated GATC-sites of replicative TTVMV, respectively (table 1). To completely digest DNA and reduce the background level observed in qPCR, exonuclease III (ExoIII; Fermentas, Burlington, Canada) was added, as described elsewhere [9] . Full-length genomes of TTMV were detected by inverse PCR. Briefly, the reaction mix was composed of 5 mL of nucleic acids, 1 mM of each primer (TTMV-LY-11F and TTMV-LY-10R) (table 1), 2 mM of deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix and Expand High Fidelity enzyme mix (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany). Quantification of replicated TTMV was achieved by TaqMan real-time PCR assays (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) with primers targeting specifically a GATC-site. The qPCR assays were optimised as previouly recommended [10] . The amplification step was realised in 25 mL volumes containing 12.5 mL iQ Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), 0.3 mM each of primers and probe (table 1) and 5 mL of DNA. Amplification was detected with a CFX96 detection machine (BioRad). DNA from untransfected cells was included in each reaction. For transfection studies, the replication rate was calculated as the ratio of the quantified amount of replicative TTMV detected after DpnI digestion to the total quantified amount of TTMV (replicative and residual input TTMV genomes).

Using PCR, the TTMV-LY genomes found in pleural effusion samples were also identified in the corresponding nasal aspiration sample for each patient. Among the three patients for whom the pleural effusion samples were only positive for TTMV, two were male and one was female. They were aged 48 months, 7 months and 37 months for TTMV-LY1, -LY2 and -LY3, respectively, and presented the same clinical features as the other patients of the cohort. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on the nucleotide sequence of predictive open reading frame (ORF)1, as recommended by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [5] . Based on the phylogenetic tree ( fig. 1 ), all three new isolates of TTMV-LY belong to genogroup I and are related to previously identified TGP96 (64% of maximum identity) and Pt-TTV8-II (44% of maximum identity) isolates. TTMV-LY isolates possess at least three ORFs: one major ORF1 composed of 673, 667 and 659 amino acids (aa) for TTMV-LY1, -LY2 and -LY3, respectively, and several overlapping ORFs. The TTMV-LY1 and -LY3 have two overlapping ORFs of 91 and 101 aa, and 97 and 129 aa, respectively, as opposed to TTMV-LY2, which has ORFs of 100 and 109 aa, and an additional ORF3 of 113 aa. One other feature of these viruses is the highly conserved 59-untranslated region (UTR), as shown in figure 2 . Figure 2a shows that TTMV-LY2 possesses a significant insertion in this 59-UTR, forming a predictive secondary structure of RNA sequence ( fig. 2b ).

We initially observed that, as shown in figure 3a , all the TTMV-LY isolates actively replicated in both cell lines. There was no significant difference between the replication mean rates for the three isolates in A549 cells (25%) and in HEK293T (10%).

This replication rate remained relatively constant in A549 cells until day 7, but in HEK293T cells it slightly decreased beginning on day 4. The release of TTMV-LY particles showed a similar pattern as to the replication rate within the cells, with a peak at day 4 post-transfection, with an eight-fold increase for A549 and a 20-fold increase for HEK293T supernatants.",

As a first step, the biological properties of these new isolates of TTMV-LY were investigated. We first transfected the full-length genome of the three TTMV-LY viruses to ascertain whether the viral replication takes place in HEK293T cells, as already demonstrated [17, 18] , and subsequently in alveolar epithelial A549 cells, wich act as a model of type II pneumocytes [19] . We described for the first time that TTMV, like TTV, was able to replicate in cell lines after transfection of its genome and thus lead to the production of infectious virions. We observed that the viral infection was more efficient in alveolar cells than in kidney cells, suggesting a better tropism of the TTMV-LY genome in pulmonary cells and a strengthened role in the pathogenesis of LRTI. We hypothesised that, like porcine circoviruses and papillomaviruses, the potential pathogenicity of TTMV could be restricted to some species or a group of species [20, 21] . Indeed, in this study, high genetic TTMV diversity was observed only among different patients, but the same full-length genome was systematically found in the different samples taken from the same patient. All three genomes, moreover, belonged to the same phylogenetic branch of Betatorquevirus (group I). We investigated the conserved 59UTR genome sequence of the three TTMV-LY genome sequences to determine if specific replication patterns were present. No assumed origin of replication (_AGT_TTACA) was identified, but an insertion of 200 bases forming a stem-loop structure in the conserved 59-UTR was detected in the TTMV-LY2. As previously described, this secondary structure could be involved in the viral pathogenicity as enhancer and promoter elements [22] . Despite this secondary structure presented by TTMV-LY2, no gain in the replication yield was observed compared to the other TTMV-LYs. However, the effects of such genetic modifications could be expressed in another biological manner, in response to the interaction with the host cell, as observed for many viruses.",

            "text": "As a second step, we investigated the response of the host A549 cells to TTMV-LY infection by measuring the production of soluble mediators implicated in the inflammation process. Alveolar type II epithelial cells maintain alveolar integrity by forming the alveolar barrier, producing surfactants and repairing injured type I epithelium [23] . Moreover, they are an integral part of the lung innate immunity, acting to intensify the function of dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages by cytokine secretion [24, 25] . No cytopathic effect was observed in A549 cells, but infection with TTMV-LY induced a complex innate immune response, differently modulated by the three isolates. Thus, TTMV-LY infection resulted in the production of not only pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-c as previously described [26] , but significant levels of IL-10 or IL-13 anti-inflammatory cytokines were also measured, corroborating that TTMV-LY may modify innate immune balance, as already demonstrated for TTV [27] . The fact that different isolates of TTMV can impact differently on the production of soluble mediators is not surprising in view of what has been observed with other viral infections [28, 29] , and may reflect their recognition by different receptors and/or interaction through different molecular pathways. IL-12 seems to play a central role in the response to TTMV-LY infection. This cytokine, enhancing the proliferation and cytotoxicity of activated T-cells and natural killer cells, is thought to be a key factor in the regulation of the host defence against many intracellular pathogens [30] . We may assume that TTMV-LY-mediated lung inflammation may result from the abundant secretion of IL-12, although further studies would be needed to prove this.",
