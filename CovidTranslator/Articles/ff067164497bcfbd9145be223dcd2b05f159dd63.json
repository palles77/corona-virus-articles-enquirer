Currently, viral RNA detection by several polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based technics is almost the only way to confirm the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in practice. On the other hand, RNA testing based on throat or nasopharyngeal swabs brought out negligible false-negative risk. 8 The reported positive rate varied for different swab specimens in COVID-19 patients. 3, 9 Many cases that were strongly epidemiologically linked to SARS-CoV-2 exposure and with typical lung radiological findings remained RNA negative in their upper respiratory tract samples. There are four potential reasons: 1) the viral loads in upper respiratory tract samples are much lower than that in lower respiratory tract samples in COVID-19 patients; 9 2) the releasing viral loads of patients in different stage of infection varies with a wide range; 10 3) the collection of high-quality swab specimen requires skillful health-workers; and 4) PCR reagents from different sources have high variance. Consequently, these problems lead to a noteworthy delay of early diagnosis and following management and propose serious challenge to providing timely life support treatment and preventive quarantine.",

Besides, epidemiological studies could be conducted using immunoassays. Additional, it can play an important role in searching potential animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2 using Ab-ELISA because the double antigen sandwich method makes it free from species restriction. It has been less than three months since the SARS-CoV-2 virus first invaded human society, and the prevalence of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 is nearly zero. Therefore, at least during the current outbreak which is likely to continue to May or June 2020, individuals who are seropositive could be a probably preceding infector of SARS-CoV-2. During this short period, therefore, the total antibody could be considered as a recent infection marker similar as IgM antibody. Our data showed that the sensitivity of total antibody testing is higher than IgM or IgG. Therefore, the total antibody detection should be given high priority to be implemented in current clinical and public health practice. If, unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 become a common respiratory transmission pathogen lasting in human society, such as influenza viruses or low-pathogenicity types of coronaviruses, rather than be completely eradicated as its relative SARS-CoV-1 virus, the serological diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection will more depend on the detection of IgM antibody in post-epidemic areas, such as Wuhan, China, in the subsequent epidemic All rights reserved.

Our results demonstrated an excellent sensitivity of Ab test in detections of patient's samples after 1-week since onset. Notably, even in the early stages of the illness within 7-day, some patients with negative nucleic acid findings could be screened out through antibody testing. Combining RNA test and antibody test significantly raised the sensitivity for detecting patients (p < 0.001). Above findings indicate that the antibody detection be an important supplement to RNA detection during the illness course.Up to date, the confirm diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection entirely depend on the viral nucleic acid testing. Even though with high analytical sensitivity, the real-world performance of PCR based RNA testing is unsatisfied. Many suspected patients had to be tested for several days with multiple samples before confirm diagnosis were made, and during the waiting time they might have not enough priority to receive relevant treatments and quarantine managements.3 These problems make the timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection one of the bottlenecks for adapting relevant actions to limit the damage of current outbreak. Our study provided robust evidences that: 1) the acute antibody response in SARS-CoV-2 infection patient is very similar to many other acute viral infections; 2) the serological testing can be a powerful approach in achieving timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection; and 3) the total antibody is more sensitive than IgM and IgG for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
