They also represent a substantial burden on health services [1, 2] . LRTIs can be clinically broadly divided into tracheitis, pneumonia, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis. However, the clinical pictures overlap. Furthermore, some upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) provoke wheezing in susceptible children even without lower airway infection, which brings additional complexity [3] . In small children LRTIs generally have viral etiology [4] . The most common cause of LRTI is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); other possible viral pathogens are human rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and human bocavirus. Viral LRTI cannot be reliably distinguished from an infection with Mycoplasma pneumonia [5, 6] .",

However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly between the different causes of childhood pneumonia [4] . Although chest radiographs and laboratory studies cannot reliably distinguish between different viral pathogens and even not between viral and bacterial etiology, they may be necessary to assess the severity of illness, evaluate potential complications, or to exclude other conditions in the differential diagnosis [10, 11] .

Despite the retrospective nature of the study we got informed consent for blood withdrawal and all the procedures from parents or caregivers, as we usually do for all of our hospitalized patients. Children were treated under the diagnosis of pneumonia, bronchitis, or bronchiolitis. Children with croup were not included. We excluded all premature infants, children with cancer, immunodeficiency, transplantation, known asthma or other chronic respiratory (e.g., mucoviscidosis), heart or neurologic diseases. We also excluded all children with invasive bacterial (super) infections (e.g., bacterial pneumonia, bacteriemia, and purulent meningitis). Therefore we also excluded the patients with lobar pneumonia. Altogether 278 children with at least one clinical and/or X-ray sign of LRTI were included. Wheezing, pharyngitis, and rhinitis was diagnosed clinically by the pediatrician, who treated the child. Pneumonia was diagnosed by the chest X-ray, confirmed by radiologist and pediatrician. Chest X-ray was performed only in those 152 patients who had clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of pneumonia (e.g., tachypnea, respiratory distress, crackles, and other localized auscultatory findings). Patient was considered febrile, when the body temperature at any time during the treatment exceeded 38 \u00b0C, measured with an infrared tympanic thermometer. Venous blood was taken during the routine procedure in all treated children for the analysis of complete and differential blood count and C-reactive protein (CRP). In some cases laboratory tests were performed more than once and we considered the highest CRP value and white blood cell (WBC) count for statistical analysis. Children were treated with supplemental oxygen, administered via nasal prongs or face mask when oxygen saturation of peripheral blood (SpO 2 ), measured by pulse oxymeter fell below 92 % or when the signs of respiratory distress (at the discretion of physician) were present. Patients who needed ventilatory support were treated at our intensive care unit (ICU) and were all endotracheally intubated. Criteria for the ICU admission were: hypoxemia (arterial oxygen tension < 60 mm Hg or SpO 2 < 92 %) persisting despite administration of more than 40 % oxygen, persisting hypercapnia (carbon dioxide tension over 50 mm Hg), apnea, persistent respiratory acidosis, worsening respiratory distress, and disturbed mental status. All the patients treated in PICU were enrolled in the study when they were first admitted to normal ward. Clinical and laboratory characteristics analyzed in this study also refer to this (first) part of the hospitalization.",

Collected swabs were stored in 2 ml of 0.9 % sterile salt solution and kept at 4 \u00b0C until processed or for maximum of 3 days. Microbiological testing was performed at the National Laboratory for Health, Environment and Food, Maribor. In order to encompass the majority of described respiratory pathogens in sample material, multiplex PCR assay was used [12] . The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA) is FDA approved and CE-IVD certified. It detects influenza A virus (subtype H1, H1N1 and H3), influenza B virus, RSV, metapneumovirus, coronaviruses (subtypes NL63, OC43, 229E and HKU1), adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses (serotype 1-4), bocavirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. The assay also includes internal controls for amplifica-logistic regression, adjusting for age and sex, which was used to test the significance of association between a particular virus and those clinical data which are categorical variables and generalized linear model was used for the same purpose for continuous variables. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of patients are presented in Table 1. tion and extraction. In this study we used FilmArray RP IVD v1.6 pouches. The sample was added to the pouch in microbiological safety cabinet class II according to the manufacturer's protocol. In short, the FilmArray pouch stores all of the necessary reagents for sample preparation, RT-PCR, and detection in a freeze-dried format. Approximately 1 ml of hydration solution and 300 \u03bcl of 1:1.5 diluted sample in buffer was injected into the pouch.",

            "text": "Longer length of hospitalization and association with pneumonia encountered in our patients with RSV infection both support the concept of more serious lower respiratory tract injury caused by RSV, compared to other viruses [8] . Human coronaviruses have been known to induce upper respiratory tract symptoms such as nasal congestion and rhinorrhea and their pathogenicity in healthy infants and children was considered to be low. Coronaviruses are often found even in asymptomatic children [13] . On the other hand, coronavirus infections have been detected in variable proportions (2-8 %) of neonates, infants, and young children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia [14] . In our study coronaviruses were mainly found as a coinfection, as already reported previously [15] . However, association with pneumonia and need for supplemental oxygen, both indicate high pathogenicity of the virus, which was recently reported also by Lee et al. [16] . Rhinoviruses may cause pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients, elderly persons, and children with cystic fibrosis; however, their true impact is questionable because they may be an inciting event for other infectious processes and are often detected even in asymptomatic children [17] . Rhinoviruses can also cause severe LRTIs in preterm infants and even in otherwise healthy children [18, 19] . Garcia-Garcia et al. [20] even found rhinovirus as a most common cause of viral pneumonia in otherwise healthy school children. Our results support the important role of human rhinoviruses in children, hospitalized because of the LRTI symptoms; however, they were not found to be a common cause of pneumonia. Shorter length of hospitalization and significant absence of fever in our patients with rhinovirus infections probably also reflect a less severe direct injury of the lower airways and/or prevailing mechanism of asthma exacerbation in rhinovirus infections, which is more amenable to treatment compared to direct LRT injury, typical for other viruses. According to multiple logistic regression analysis parainfluenza virus (p < 0.01) and bocavirus (p = 0.05) infections were associated with less common need for supplemental oxygen compared with other viruses.",

According to our results, we can speculate that asymptomatic shedding is more common than true coinfection. In different studies rhinovirus was isolated from nasopharynx in 0-45 % (mean 14 %) of healthy individuals, though PCR positivity usually lasted for less than 2 weeks [17, 35] .

The high rate of coinfection may be due to the fact that bocavirus has been shown to have prolonged shedding even from asymptomatic children [29] . Therefore it is difficult to establish the clinical characteristics of bocavirus infection. The most consistently reported symptoms include cough, fever, and rhinorrhea [30] . Higher titers of bocavirus in respiratory secretions have been associated with increased wheezing, suggesting a causal role [31] , which is consistent with our results.",

Most of the infections occurred during the four winter months. From December until March we identified 104 (52.5 %) cases and from May until August only 30 (15.1 %) cases of LRTIs. During the four winter months (December to March), 81.8 % of all RSV infections were detected. In January and February this virus was also the most commonly identified pathogen. Rhinovirus prevailed as an isolate from March to May and then again from September to November. Of all bocavirus infections 75.6 % were detected from November to April and 63.6 % of all metapneumovirus infections during the late spring (in May and June).",
