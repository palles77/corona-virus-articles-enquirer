            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses (1) . They are widespread and can be found in many species of mice, horses, whales, birds, cats, dogs, pigs, and humans (1) . Development of the infection, can lead to additional complications, including respiratory tract disease and organ dysfunction, particularly renal failure and immune suppression, enteric, neurologic or hepatic diseases (2, 3) . The majority of patients have typical symptoms, such as fever with or without cough, and breathing difficulties (4) . Mid-dle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a new and unknown origin respiratory virus with genotypic and phenotypic diversity; thus, this virus can mutate, increasing its virulence and even causing tissue tropism. There is a high-frequency mortality rate around > 50% and median age of the majority of identified cases affected with this virus is 56 years. Very little is known about its behavior (5, 6) . Humans are known to maintain circulation of four different human coronaviruses (hCoVs) at a global population level. These are a part of the spectrum of agents that cause the common cold. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV constitutes the fifth hCoV, which was in circulation for a limited time during 2002 and 2003, when a virus appeared in humans and caused an outbreak affecting at least 8,000 people. Symptoms matched the clinical picture of acute primary viral pneumonia. MERS-CoV, a novel coronavirus, was detected for the first time in September of 2012 in Saudi Arabia, an area heavily impacted by this virus at present. Between April and June 2013, 81 cases of infection by this hCoV were reported in Saudi Arabia. Of those, 49 patients died, so fatality rate is high (2) . This virus (MERS-CoV) causes severe acute respiratory infection in humans (7) . Subsequently MERS-CoV has been reported in other countries, including Tunisia, United Arab, Emirates, Italy, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Qatar (2, (8) (9) (10) (11) . The first cases of MERS-CoV infections reported in Iran were two cases in Kerman, a city in southeast Iran. The virus killed one of them, a 53-year-old woman. With the appearance of new cases, in view of the risk of MERS-CoV transmission to humans (6) , and because of severe infections that have been observed among the elderly, there is considerable concern about this virus (5) . Although few cases have been reported annually (around 34 case as of 12 May 2013), the morbidity and mortality rate of this infection is alarming (7) . Unfortunately, at present, there are no specific treatments or effective drugs for this deadly disease, and no vaccine. In the absence of an effective treatment, the appropriate infection controls include rapid diagnostics and isolation of patients, useful strategies for preventing further transmission and spread of this infectious agent (5) . Currently, real-time reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays are used for detection of MERS-CoV in respiratory, blood, and stool samples of patients. Real-time RT-PCR assay is highly sensitive and is able to detect viruses even in low copy numbers (12, 13).",

Development of a rapid and accurate diagnostic kit can facilitate early-stage detection of infected individuals with respiratory symptoms who have returned from the Hajj and are re-entering the country, preventing the spread of infection. The best methods for detection of MERS-CoV, recommended by WHO, are real-time RT-PCR assays, for upE gene as the initial screening of disease and for ORF1b (or ORF1a) gene as the final confirmation of MERS-CoV infection. It is notable that traditional (gel-based) RT-PCR methods require amplification in a thermo cycler (after cDNA preparation via RT process) and product analysis by electrophoresis gel, both of which are time-consuming and laborious (14) . By eliminating the need for post-amplification product processing, the real-time RT-PCR method enables shortened turn-around times for reporting results, which is critical for determining isolation for suspected case patients and contact tracing. Real-time RT-PCR assays are sensitive, rapid, and can be automated. They also have high reproducibility and since the need for post-PCR processing is eliminated, they can prevent carry-over contamination (14) . TaqMan probe-based real-time RT-PCR assays not only provide confidence in identification of target genes due to specific probing, but also reduce the risk of laboratory product contamination, because the amplification reaction and detection of PCR products are performed in a single tube (15) . Despite these advantages of rRT-PCR assays, these techniques are two-step.",

This increases the sensitivity of the assays and is affordable economically, in addition to the other advantages mentioned above. Since, acquiring patient samples and the complete viral genome is difficult, according to WHO recommendations and standard protocols, we instead synthesized RNA sequences of upE and ORF1b genes as the template signatures, and the TaqMan-based diagnostic rRT-PCR assays were carried out using these synthetic genes for detection of MERS-CoV.
