Diagnosis was based on histopathology, specific histochemical stains, and/or on polymerase chain reaction. All bacteria identified belonged to the nontuberculous Mycobacterium complex. Several treatment protocols were attempted, frequently based on the use of enrofloxacin. In all, 3 ferrets were considered cured. Mycobacteriosis in ferrets is a polymorphous disease with diverse clinical presentations. It is also likely an underdiagnosed disease in pet ferrets, which appear to be particularly susceptible to environmental sources. Mycobacteriosis should be included in the differential diagnosis for ocular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal diseases; in particular, it should be differentiated from systemic coronavirus infection.",

A negative result was obtained for 1 case, but the histopathological results were conclusive for mycobacteriosis. A possible explanation for this negative result was that the sample was obtained by swabbing the conjunctiva and likely contained too few bacteria. In case 4, the initial PCR on a collected conjunctival swab showed negative results, but a second PCR on biopsy samples of the conjunctiva showed positive results and led to the identification of the mycobacteria. The 9 bacteria identified were atypical mycobacteria, and had not been previously described in ferrets. Similar to findings in other published case reports of ferrets diagnosed with mycobacteriosis, no significant changes were found in hematologic or biochemical analysis. 9 When performed on granulomatous or pyogranulomatous lesions, histopathology was consistently effective in disease diagnosis. All but 1 case contained demonstrable acid-fast bacilli. In the case where Ziehl-Neelsen staining showed negative results, the pathologist found the lesions highly consistent with mycobacteriosis, and the PCR result was positive, allowing the diagnosis to be confirmed.",

            "text": "The question of the zoonotic potential of mycobacterial infection is a key element of the information provided to the owner and of the decision to treat or euthanize. Many mycobacteria can cause diseases in man. The zoonotic risk is clear for bacteria of the M. tuberculosis group. However, for bacteria of the M. avium group or for rapid growing bacteria such as M. fortuitum or M. chelonae, the actual zoonotic risk appears to be minimal for humans with normal immune systems. Most human infections with atypical organisms originate from the environment, and not from other humans or from animals. 11, 29 Nevertheless, precise diagnosis is essential before discussing treatment with an owner. 2 In the cases described in this article, owners were encouraged to pursue mycobacterial identification. In 11 cases where identification was achieved, all identified mycobacteria were atypical mycobacteria. The decision to treat should be made carefully, and in conjunction with the owner's physician. Several treatment protocols have been described in ferrets ( Table 1 ). The ferrets in this report were primarily treated with fluoroquinolones, in particular, enrofloxacin. Enrofloxacin treatment has the advantage of being relatively inexpensive, easily accessible for veterinarians, and easy to administer by owners. In France, fluoroquinolones are considered critical antibiotics, and their use for infection prevention or for minor infections is discouraged; however their use for treatment of mycobacterial infections is likely justified. The use of human antituberculous drugs such as rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, rifabutin, or ethambutol could be considered, but there may be serious ethical concerns regarding the use of these drugs, as antibiotic resistance is of critical concern. 25,26 Another antibiotic to consider is azithromycin, which is well tolerated in ferrets and can be used in association with fluoroquinolones. Existing information regarding the typical susceptibility of each bacterium in humans can also help with antimicrobial selection. The use of interferon should also be investigated. It has been suggested that interferon-gamma may play an important role in host resistance to mycobacteria. 30, 31 Human interferon alpha-A, which is inexpensive and easy to use, has proved useful in containing or treating other ferret diseases such as systemic coronavirus infection (authors' personal observations) and should be investigated as a concurrent treatment for mycobacteriosis. The slow growth of mycobacterial organisms necessitates long-term treatment, in some cases, many months. Gauging treatment success is difficult. In the cases assessed in this case series, treatment ended with the death of the animal or after more than 1 year without return of clinical disease signs.",

Veterinarians should include mycobacteriosis in their differential disease diagnoses of ferret patients that present with eyelid swelling, upper and lower respiratory disease, and digestive diseases. For cases of abdominal pyogranulomatous lesions, mycobacteriosis should also be considered along with systemic coronavirus infection. ",
