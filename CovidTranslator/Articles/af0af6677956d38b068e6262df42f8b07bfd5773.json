In immunocompromised hosts, the asexual cycle may be persistent. Alternatively, merozoites from Type II meronts may initiate the sexual cycle of development. (4a) Microgametocytes produce 12 to 16 microgametes. (4b) Microgametes released from host cells seek out and fertilize macrogametocytes. (5) The resulting zygote differentiates into an oocyst (la) which is released into the intestinal lumen. (6) Thick-walled and thin-walled oocysts in varying stages of sporulation pass out of the host in feces. Thin-walled oocysts may spontaneously rupture in the host, ensuring persistent infection in immuno compromised hosts (arrow from 6 to 3a). (7) Oocyst released from a host of one mammalian species can infect a wide variety of mammals of other species. Young animals are most susceptible to infection.

In 1907, Tyzzer described pro tozoan parasites which he observed infecting the gastric epithelium of laboratory mice. The parasites attached to host cells and had asexual and sexual stages in their life cycles. He proposed that the mode of spread was by the fecal-oral route as he observed oocysts in feces. Tyzzer proposed the name Cryptosporidium muris for the organism. In 1910, Tyzzer extended his previous study by meticulously describing the life cycle of C. muris and proposed that the genus name Cryp tosporidium be adopted along with the new species name C. muris. Tyzzer also suggested that sporozoites liberated from mature oocysts in the gastric glands could produce autoinfection.",

They are capable of extraintes tinal multiplication. Members of the family Eimeriidae, including the genera Eimeria and Isospora, live exclusively within the gastrointestinal or respiratory Hoover et al. (1981) epithelium but differ from the Cryptosporidiidae in that they develop within the cytoplasm of the host cell, their microgametes possess flagella, and their oocysts have sporocysts with eight sporozoites. Species of Cryptosporidium frequently have been named according to the host in which they were initially observed. This convention arose from the belief that Cryptosporidium was host specific. The literature, at present, contains the names of 21 species of Cryptosporidium (Fayer et ai, 1990b) . Cross-transmission studies and careful morphometric analyses, however, have placed the validity of many of these species in doubt. The currently recognized species of Cryptospori dium include C. muris of mice and cattle, C. parvum of a wide variety of mam malian species including man, C. baileyi of chickens, C. meleagridis of turkeys, C. serpentis of snakes, and C. nasorum which occurs in fish (Fayer et ai, 1990b) .

As with other coccidia, exposure to reducing conditions, enzymes and bile salts are all important factors in excystation. Oocysts exposed to appropriate conditions outside the host also can excyst (Current, 1990) . Oocysts have even been induced to excyst by exposure to 37\u00b0C tap water (Current, 1986) or by exposure to a mild bleach solution followed by exposure to 37\u00b0C water . The release of sporozoites under these conditions is probably due to osmotic stress. Bile salts alone induce excystation and the effect of bile is enhanced considerably if oocysts are first subjected to an oxidizing agent, such as a weak hypochlorite solution Woodmansee, 1987; Coffman, 1989) . Exposure of oocysts overnight to between 4 and 23\u00b0C facilitates excystation when the precooled oocysts are incubated in phosphate-buffered saline for several hours at 37\u00b0C (Current, 1990) .

This indentation develops until it encompasses the parasite, which when the process is completed, lies within a vacuole of host cell origin. A dense band forms beneath the cell membrane nearest the sporozoite's apical end. The contents of the sporozoite's micronemes are released during penetration. The sporozoite's anterior end and the membrane of the vacuole near the anterior end fuse with the host cell membrane. This region undergoes further differentiation to form the \"feeder organelle\" which attaches the parasite to the host cell.

As the trophozoite develops, the feeder organelle further differentiates; it forms a junction which strengthens the attachment of the parasite to the host cell (Figure 2 .4). Studies in mice indicate that trophozoites develop into Type I meronts with six to eight merozoites between 8 and 16 hours postinfection (Current and Reese, 1986) . In this process the nucleus of the tro phozoite divides. Three successive synchronous nuclear divisions result in the production of eight nuclei which migrate to the parasite's periphery to form buds that eventually become fully differentiated merozoites. This process is called ectomerogony (Figures 2.5 and 2.6). No nuclear division spindles, plaques, or centrioles have been observed. Mature Type I meronts have been observed in infected mice 16 hours after infection. The persistence of Type I merogony is one of the reasons for the severity of the infections which occur in AIDS patients.",

Inoculation of the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chicken embryos with sporozoites of C. baileyi is followed by an intense proliferation of parasites. The parasites grow in endoderm cells and subsequently release large numbers of oocysts into the chorioallantoic fluid.

Fecal contamination of food and water contribute to the high prevalence of cryptosporidial infection in persons where poor sanitary conditions exist. Contaminated food, fomites, flies, and water are sources of infection with Cryptosporidium (Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Casemore, 1990; Ungar, 1990a) . The documentation of waterborne transmission in dicates that the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis is not unlike that of giardiasis. The epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis is undoubtedly influenced by the ability of the thick-walled, fully sporulated oocyst to survive in the environment. Commonly employed chemical disinfectants are ineffective against the oocyst at concentrations commonly used. Oocyst viability is reduced by exposure for 30 minutes to 10% formalin, to 50% or higher concentrations of ammonia, and to 70 to 100% commercial bleach (Angus et al, 1982a; Campbell et al, 1982) , but such concentrations are much higher than are commonly used in hospitals and in laboratories. Disinfection of drinking water by commonly used procedures has not proven effective (see Treatment and Control). Oocyst viability is reduced by exposure for 30 minutes to temperatures above 65\u00b0C or below freezing (-20\u00b0C) (Tzipori, 1983; Anderson, 1985) . Oocysts will survive at 4\u00b0C for longer than 3 to 4 months when stored in 2.5% potassium dichromate (k 2 Cr 2 0 7 ) (Current and Haynes, 1984) .",

Numerous prevalence studies have been conducted but the data available are not always easy to compare because the populations sampled differ in age, symptomatology, and immune status and because different sampling and diagnostic techniques were used to assess infection Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Ungar, 1990a) . In addition, in many studies appropriate control groups were not included. Nonetheless, several gen eralizations can be made from the myriad of studies performed. It may be con cluded that the overall prevalence in industrialized countries is about 2.1%, in fection is observed more frequently in children (3.0%) than in adults (0.8%), and individuals with symptoms are more likely to be infected than asymptomatic individuals. In addition, it is possible that in countries with poor sanitation the prevalence rate among patients whose immune status is unknown is about 8.5%. In general it may be concluded that serologic surveys conducted in all types of countries indicate a rate of seropositivity higher than would be indicated by the incidence of symptoms (Table 2. 3). It is also generally true that Cryptosporidium infection occurs with greater frequency in persons whose immune status is im paired, but who do not have AIDS, than in the general population. Such persons include those with a variety of conditions which cause immunosuppression as well as those who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. It is also certainly true that very young, malnourished infants and the very old suffer more severely from Cryptosporidia than do others because they have a diminished immune responsive ness.",

The processing of the eluted material was also improved by its fixation in 10% neutral-buffered formalin or by agitation in a detergent solution of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and a 0.1% Tween 80 (SDS/Tween) to break up large aggregates. The proportion of oocysts in the samples which were detected in the sample trap was further improved by the use of gradient centrifugation procedures employing sucrose (1.23 g/ml), potassium citrate (1.195 g/ml), or Percoll-sucrose (1.09 g/ml) gradients. Finally, detection methodologies were improved by the use of cellulose nitrate membrane filters to capture the parasites and by the use of fluorescent-labeled polyclonal or mono clonal antisera to enhance parasite detection (Musial et al, 1987; LeChevallier et al, 1990) .",

Cryptosporidium serpentis, which was first observed in captive snakes in 1977, is currently the only recognized species in reptiles (Brownstein et ai, 1977) , and C. nasorum, detected in a marine tropical fish purchased in a pet store, is the only recognized species in fish (Hoover et ai, 1981) . Recent surveys of Cryptosporidium of amphibia, reptiles, and fish have uncovered evidence that there are several morphologic types of Cryptosporidium in these animals. The differences in developmental forms and in oocyst size and shape make it likely that several species probably occur in lower vertebrates (Upton, 1990) . Since cross-transmission studies have not been performed on any of the Cryptosporidia observed in these studies, it is probably best to follow the current convention which recognizes only C. serpentis and C. nasorum. Even the latter species has yet to be validated by transmission studies.",

Cryptosporidiosis is a clinical problem primarily in captive reptiles (Upton et al, 1989) , while in wild populations, clinical symptoms have generally not been noted. The prevalence rate of infection in reptiles appears to be low (<2%), even among captive zoo animals. Infection in snakes may be persistent. Anorexia, regurgitation, lethargy, midbody swelling, and weight loss are prominent clinical signs. Organisms are found in gastric mucosa on histological examination. In the gastric region lesions are hyperplastic and hypertrophic and there is atrophy of glandular cells, inflammation of the mucosa, and edema of the submucosa and lamina propria. There is an inflammatory response characterized by aggregations of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and heterophils. Excess mucus production, multi focal necrosis, and mucosal petechiae may occur. Bacterial and viral infection may complicate C. serpentis infection. The role of bacteria and viruses in the patho genesis and the susceptibility of snakes to cryptosporidial infection, however, is not known.",

Contemporary research indicates that birds may harbor four species of Cryptosporidium (Lindsay and Blagburn, 1990) . Two species, C. anserinum and C. tyzzeri, are considered nomen nuda because there are inadequate descriptions of their oocysts and their life cycles in the publications on which the names were proposed. Cryptosporidium meleagridis of turkeys and C. baileyi of chickens presently are the only validly named species. It is possible that there is a species which infects bobwhite quail.

It is currently under investigation because of its ability to produce a generalized intestinal infection in quail in which it may cause severe disease and high mortality.",

Infection occurs in calves as young as 4 days of age and as old as 4 weeks. Most infections peak 1 to 3 weeks following birth. This pattern has been observed in sheep, goats, and farmed deer. Data are sparse on pigs and horses, but such data indicate an age relationship of infection similar to that in other species but with the infection extending 3 months or longer (Kim, 1990) . Cryptosporidiosis has been observed in companion animals, such as dogs and cats, ranging in age from 1 week to adulthood (Riggs, 1990) . Many of the infected animals were immunosuppressed and were concomitantly infected with viruses or with other enteropathogens which may have affected age-based resistance. Cryp tosporidiosis in nonhuman primates has been reported to occur in juvenile animals (Kovatch and White, 1972; Wilson et al, 1984; Riggs, 1990) . Age is clearly a factor in susceptibility of rodents (Perryman, 1990) . While wild mice of all ages carry infection, laboratory-reared inbred and congenic mice are clearly most susceptible before their third week of life. Infections in almost all mice are self-limiting and do not extend much beyond 4 weeks of age. Neonatal athymic (nude) BALB/c mice (Heine et al, 1984a) , neonatal but not adult mice immuno compromised by drug treatment or by treatment with anti-CD4 or by a combina tion of anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies , neonatal and adult athymic NIH-III mice and NIH-III mice which are severely immune deficient (SCID) (Mead et al, 1991) and adult C57BL/6 mice infected with the LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus (Darban et al, 1991) all are easily infected and develop persistent Cryptosporidium infections.",

It is difficult to determine which pathogen is responsible for the clinical signs of illness in calves with mixed infections. Cryptosporidium parvum infections occur most frequently in calves that are also infected with a rotavirus, a Coronavirus, enterotoxogenic Escherichia coli-K99+, or a Salmonella. The role of E. coli-K99+ is unclear because there is generally no overlap between infection with C. parvum and the E. coli in neonatal calves. A possible role for nonenterotoxigenic strains of E. coli, Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, a calici-like virus, the virus of bovine virus diarrhea, a toga-like virus, and Giardia and Eimeria in increasing the pathogenicity of C. parvum in calves has been suggested (Angus, 1990).

Infection may also result from direct contact with infected animals, infected humans, or contaminated surfaces. The incubation period in man is from 2 to 10 days. This estimate is based on case reports. Seven days is the most frequently reported period after infection before the onset of symptoms (Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Ungar, 1990a) . A 7-day incubation period is consistent with data on the duration of the C. parvum life cycle in vitro (Current and Haynes, 1984) and in animals (Current and Reese, 1986) . In immunocompetent individuals the duration of clinical illness including diarrhea is from 1 to 3 weeks and oocyst shedding persists for 1 to 4 weeks or more after symptoms are resolved Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Ungar, 1990a) . In 49 patients with symptomatic cryptosporidiosis, a median period of 18 days elapsed between the onset of clinical symptoms and the dis appearance of oocysts from stool specimens (Shepherd et al, 1988) . In the adults of this group (19 patients) the medium period of oocyst shedding was 19 days and in the children (30 patients) the median period was 17 days. The period between the appearance of symptoms and the cessation of oocyst shedding ranged from 9 to 50 days in the children and 11 to 28 days in the adults. Oocyst shedding persists for a period approximately twice as long as symptoms persist , but is quite variable (Anonymous, 1982; Hart et al, 1984; Hunt et al, 1984; Baxby et al, 1985; Shepherd et al, 1988) .",

In both immunocompetent and immunocompromised (AIDS) patients a marked IgG response to cryptosporidial antigens detectible by ELISA occurred within 6 weeks of diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis. Immunoglobulins specific for Cryptosporidia detectable by ELISA persisted for at least 10 months in several of the AIDS patients. IgM generally disappeared from the serum of most patients within 4 months of diagnosis and IgG within 12 months . In the majority of infected Peruvians, however, subsequent studies using ELISA demonstrated that there were persistent IgG and IgM responses . Persistent antibody responses occurred in some U.S. Peace Corps volunteers serving in Africa also . Approximately 14% of the Peace Corps volunteers studied by Ungar et al (1989) seroconverted each year. Filipino children infected with C. parvum had IgM, IgG, and IgA titers significantly higher than the titers which occurred in children from the Clark Air Force Base (Laxer et al, 1990) . The titers in the infected children, which were high during the acute phase of the infection, persisted for 6 weeks which was the duration of convalescence. The fact that the infected children had stable titers probably indicates that they had prior exposure to the parasite. The absence of increases in the antibody titers during the study period makes it difficult to correlate the immunoglobulin responses with the course of the infections. Thai orphans had patterns similar to those which occurred among the Filipino children. The Thai orphans had higher anti-cryptosporidial titers than did children in the United States (Janoff et al, 1990) . These studies infer that individuals from endemic regions may generally have high serum titers to Cryptosporidia which are probably a result of recurrent exposure to the parasite. Such people may be asymptomatic carriers of Cryptosporidia (Janoff et al, 1990) .",

Antigens with molecular masses ranging from 3 kDa to over 200 kDa react with immune sera from experimentally and naturally infected animals and humans (Figure 2.17) . A 23-kDa component of Cryptospor idia is recognized by nearly all immune sera. Originally identified as a component of oocysts , it was subsequently found to be present on the surfaces of sporozoites (Mead et al, 1988b) . Immunoelectron microscopy (Lumb et al, 1989) and surface labeling studies (Mead et al, 1988b ) determined the location of this antigen. Ungar and colleagues demonstrated that serum from both immunocompetent and AIDS patients infected with Cryptosporidia reacted with the antigen . Reactivity to the 23-kDa antigen developed within 10 days of infection, peaked in intensity by 3 to 4 weeks postinfection, and was lost within 4 to 5 months of infection (Mead et al., 1988b) . These data support the belief that reactivity to this antigen may be useful for diagnosis of infection.",

Examination of fecal material which has been stained by the Giemsa technique is a better diagnostic technique than is examination of biopsy samples but it un fortunately does not permit differentiation of cryptosporidial oocysts from yeasts and other debris in the feces. In 1981, a procedure based on the Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast staining technique was developed which provided clinical and research laboratories with a simple and effective method for identifying oocysts in stool samples (Henriksen and Pohlenz, 1981) . In feces stained by this method the bright red oocysts are easily differentiated from the blue-green fecal material and yeasts which are always present (Figure 2 .22). The acid-fast staining technique has been modified and improved since its introduction. Garcia et al (1983) introduced a hot acid-fast stain and Ma and Soave (1983) developed a cold acid-fast stain.

Attempts to use an antigen-capture ELISA to determine if micro scopically negative fecal samples contain cryptosporidial antigens have not been successful. The antigen-capture assay is more sensitive than is microscopic ex amination of fecal samples stained by the acid-fast procedure, but is less sensitive than the immunofluorescent procedure (Anusz et al, 1990) . Ungar (1990b) devel oped an indirect, double-antibody ELISA using polyclonal antisera for the detec tion of cryptosporidial antigens in feces but the assay is not as sensitive as the immunofluorescent procedure. A specific and sensitive ELISA would be an at tractive alternative to microscopic examination for the processing of fecal samples obtained from clinics and obtained in the course of large-scale epidemiological studies.",

Epi demiologic surveys of the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis should therefore use s\u00e9rodiagnostic methods as well as fecal examination since fecal oocyst detection methods alone will probably underestimate the true number of cases. Serologic methods may identify recently infected individuals if a series of serum samples from each individual is examined. In such samples, seroconversion, a significant increase in anti-cryptosporidial antibody titers, or the identification of antibody responses to certain antigens, may indicate recent infection. Humoral responses to cryptosporidial infections were first assayed by in direct immunofluorescence (IIF) in tests which used infected tissue sections as antigen Campbell and Current, 1983) . Using this technique, Tzipori and colleagues demonstrated anti-cryptosporidial immuno globulins in the sera of mammals of 10 species . This test showed that immunocompetent humans who had recovered from infection developed titers of 1:40 to 1:640. The titers persisted for at least 1 year (Campbell and Current, 1983 ). In the same study, Campbell and Current (1983) demonstrated that hypogammaglobulinemic individuals infected with Cryptosporidium did not develop anti-cryptosporidial immunoglobulins but that all of five AIDS patients infected with Cryptosporidium developed titers of at least 1:40 (Campbell and Current, 1983) .",

Immunoelectron microscopy (Lumb et al, 1989) and surface labeling studies (Mead et al, 1988b; Tilley and Upton, 1990) confirmed the location of this antigen.

Geographically distinct C. parvum isolates were collected from various mammalian hosts: an isolate from humans in Mexico; isolates from cattle in Alabama, Arizona, and Iowa; and an isolate from horses in Louisiana. A C. baileyi isolate from chickens was included to aid species differentiation. At least five bands were produced by field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) of the DNA. The DNA in those bands was estimated to range in size from 1500 to over 3300 kilobase pairs (Figure 2.21) . The electrophoretic patterns of the DNA of the C. parvum isolates were essentially identical. The pattern produced by C. baileyi DNA was readily distinguished from that of the C. parvum isolates. The C. baileyi pattern consisted of at least six bands. The DNA of C. baileyi was in the same size range as that from C. parvum. The similarity of the chromosomal DNA patterns of the various C. parvum isolates produced by electrophoresis contrasts with the high variability of the chromosomal DNA karyotypes among isolates of Plasmo dium falciparum and other protozoa (Kemp et al, 1985; Scholler et al, 1987) . These data reveal that the sequence differences in DNA among the isolates cannot be distinguished by the chromosomal DNA pattern comparisons using FIGE.",

An effective treatment for such patients is desperately needed. Treatment with amprolium, diloxanide furoate, furazolidone, interleukin-2, and quinine plus clindamycin has provided some relief . Controlled studies of the efficacy of these drugs for treatment of cryptosporidiosis are lacking. There have been inconclusive results from tests of spiramycin, a macrolide antibiotic similar to erythromycin and clindamycin. The favorable responses reported to occur following treatment with spiramycin have included a reduction in stool movement and volume and the cessation of oocyst shedding in some patients (Portnoy et ai, 1984; Moskovitz et al., 1988) . Some patients did experience unfavorable side effects to treatment with this drug. It is not known if concurrent medications were being administered to the patients given spiramycin in these studies (Connolly et ai, 1988; Moskovitz et al., 1988) . Treated patients in two studies of spiramycin were no better off than untreated ones (Anonymous, 1984a; Wittenberg et al., 1989) . Treatments with the somatostatin analogue SMS-201-995, diphenoxylate, and morphine sulfate have not benefitted patients either (Connolly et al., 1988; Cook et al., 1988) . Treatment of a limited number of patients with AZT seemed to confer benefit; both diarrhea and oocyst shedding stopped after treatment (Connolly et ai, 1988) . Diclazuril, a drug active against Eimeria in animals, did not have any effect on cryptosporidial infection in patients with advanced AIDS (Connolly et ai, 1990) .",

The claim that calf diarrhea can be controlled by halofuginone treatment has yet to be substantiated by carefully designed and controlled experiments (Yvore and Naciri, 1989) . Lasalocid prevents cryptosporidiosis in calves but only when given at toxic levels. This was the result of one study; however, in another study, when administered at twice the dose level used in the first study, lasalocid was effective and had no toxic side effects (Moon et al., 1982; Gobel, 1987) .

The fact that symptoms of cryptosporidiosis stopped in several patients when their immunosuppressive therapy was discontinued indicates a role for the immune system in control of the infection (Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Ungar, 1990a) . Treatments have been designed to exploit this observation. Restoration of competency, by the administration of an extract from leukocytes obtained from calves which had been immunized with Cryptosporidium, for example, has been attempted in AIDS patients infected with cryptosporidiosis. Five of eight patients given the extract in an uncontrolled study were benefitted. These patients had an amelioration in their diarrhea; both stool movement and volume decreased. When the treatment ended, two of the patients relapsed (Louie et al, 1987) . In a subsequent controlled study, six of seven patients given the leukocyte extract responded favorably and five stopped shedding oocysts (McMeeking et al, 1990) . This same product, however, proved ineffective when given to calves before they were challenged with oocysts (Fayer et al, 1987) .",

The problem with ozone as a chemical for eliminating oocysts from water is its instability and the resultant difficulty in maintaining high levels of ozone in water for periods of time sufficient to treat water under practical conditions. Preliminary experiments with peroxone, a combination of hydrogen per oxide and ozone, which is effective against bacteria and viruses, have not been any more encouraging than have the experiments in which oocysts were treated with ozone alone (C. R. Sterling, unpublished data).",

Filtration is now receiving atten tion as a means to remove oocysts (Sterling, 1990) . Studies on filtration have been somewhat encouraging as a 4-log reduction in oocyst numbers was accomplished in a pilot plant (Fox, personal communication). Studies of sewage and drinking water treatment facilities have demonstrated that sand filters remove from 91 to 99.8% of oocysts from water. Facilities without sand filters, on the other hand, remove only between 74 and 79% of oocysts (Rose et ai, 1986; Madore et al. y 1987) . These data are very preliminary and are based on studies of only a few plants. The experience at Carrollton County, Georgia, where the water treatment facility used rapid sand filtration and met federal EPA guidelines of operation during a Cryptosporidium outbreak in 1987 indicates that even the best facilities can sometimes fail to eliminate cryptosporidial oocysts from drinking water (Hayes et al, 1989) .",

Administering hyperimmune bovine colostrum may be helpful but because of the scale of many calving operations, it may be impossible because it is difficult to produce in great quantity. Control of cryptosporidiosis among children may be at least as difficult in many places as is control of cryptosporidiosis in calves.

Now that it is widely recognized as an opportunistic pathogen, Cryptosporidium has gained notoriety because it may cause life-threatening infections in AIDS patients and in children in poor countries. Despite the impressive increases in the understanding of this organism, however, much remains to be explored. Areas that need to be addressed include the taxonomic position of this parasite, its relationship to its coccidian relatives, its epidemiology, and its zoonotic potential. It is still unknown if there are isolates which differ in infectivity and pathogenicity. Effective meth ods for the elimination of transmission are still lacking and the role of infection with other agents in the morbidity and mortality it causes is still unknown. The underlying mechanisms of pathogenicity, and the role of immunity in suscepti bility are not yet understood. The mechanisms involved in the development of acquired immunity and suitable methods for cultivation of the organism are not yet known. Suitable animal models of infection are still lacking, as the present meth-ods do not closely mimic infection in humans, especially AIDS patients. The lack of a vaccine against cryptosporidiosis is a major problem. Antigens which could be tested as possible vaccines have not yet been identified or isolated and there is no effective treatment for cryptosporidiosis. Much remains to be done if disease caused by this parasite is to be controlled.",

(la) A fully sporulated oocyst, containing four naked sporozoites, the stage which is infectious, (lb) Infection begins following ingestion of the infectious oocyst. (2) Oocysts excyst within the intestine under the influence of host enzymes and release sporozoites. (3a) Each sporozoite is capable of infecting an intestinal epithelial cell, thus beginning the asexual cycle of development. (3b) Sporozoites attach to the surface of epithelial cells and penetrate into the submembranous zone. They are thus intracellular. (3c) Sporozoites differentiate into trophozoites within a host cell-derived parasitophorous vacuole. (3d) Trophozoites reproduce asexually by merogony, producing eight Type I merozoites. (3e) Merozoites released from infected cidia, Cryptosporidium may develop by an autoinfective cycle. The following description of the Cryptosporidium life cycle is based on studies of C. parvum.",
