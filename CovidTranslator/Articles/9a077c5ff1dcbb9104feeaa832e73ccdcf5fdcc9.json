The latter group met the criteria for clinical diagnosis but nucleic acid tests results were initially interpreted as suspicious. Data were compared between genders and among different age groups. The overall case fatality is 5.2%. However, patients 70 years of age or older suffered a significantly higher mortality (17.8%), associated with more patients having severe or critical illness (57.5%). Patients 50 years of age or older had a mortality of 8.0%, and those younger than 50 years, 1.2%. Male patients had a mortality of 7.6% versus 2.9% in females.",

Soon after, definitive diagnosis required the detection of viral sequence by a nucleic acid test, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Most previous reports on clinical case studies were based on this definition. However, it became evident that a significant portion of cases showed negative viral detections in pharyngeal swab specimens, although tested repeatedly, but clinically fit the diagnosis. The possible causes of this discrepancy are several, including but not limited to (1) not all patients with the lower respiratory tract involvement shed virus from the upper respiratory tracts, at least early on; (2) there might be insufficient consistency in sampling; (3) the sensitivity and specificity of the .

Strictly following this criterium had prevented many patients from receiving timely care, particularly early on when availability of enough test kits could not meet the demand of the large number of symptomatic patients. The clinicians and authorities recognized these problems and made prompt changes to the diagnostic guidelines, so that patients meeting the criteria for clinical diagnosis in Hubei Province were treated as COVID-19 patients. In the There have been several studies describing the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [1, 6, 7] , including symptoms, lab tests and radiographic features. These were smaller series, from 41 [6] to 138 confirmed cases [1] . Some of the larger series consisted of mixed cases submitted from hospitals of varying sizes and settings [7] . Analysis of larger series with cases from a single center and expanding a longer period of time should offer more accurate information about the overall clinical outcomes, mortality and morbidity, because these cases would have followed more or less uniform diagnostic algorithms and had received more consistent treatment regimens. The results should have less interference from uncontrollable factors such as inconsistency in reporting from individual hospitals.",

From late December, 2019 to early January, 2020, before large scale isolation measures were implemented, many departments in the hospital experienced cross-infection among patients and to the medical staff, due to unrecognized infectious patients and lack of proper protection. Many patients in incubation period came to the hospital for illnesses other than respiratory symptoms or fever [1] . After being designated as the specialized hospital, special isolation wards were built in each department [7] . The period from which we collected the clinical data was before the prevention was in full implementation. Indeed, the overall mortality and the rate of severe cases in the study are higher than the national figures. There may be several causes for the higher mortality in Wuhan compared to other cities. First, the rapid transmission of the virus and increase of patient volume quickly overwhelmed medical resources in Wuhan, leaving many patients to receive care later in the clinical course. Secondly, there were a large number of patients who had mild or transient symptoms who never received .

But the study only included 8 individuals, with only 2 males (one Asian). Therefore, it is still a puzzle what roles ACE2 played in the pathogenesis of this catastrophic viral disease. Whether there is difference in viral load in males and in females, or whether more severe organ injury occurred in males, is still unknown.
