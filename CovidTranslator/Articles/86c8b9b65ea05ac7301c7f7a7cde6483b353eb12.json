Methods: A randomized, controlled phase 1/2 trial was undertaken in 27 adults with a history of rapid-onset systemic allergic reactions to honeybee stings and positive specific IgE levels to evaluate the safety and efficacy of honeybee venom immunotherapy (HBVIT) combined with Advax adjuvant. Venom immunotherapy (VIT) was administered monthly for 30 months after achievement of maintenance doses. Results: Advax-adjuvanted HBVIT was well tolerated. Around week 14 of VIT, specific IgG 4 responses peaked in both groups but increased earlier, peaked higher, and were better maintained through the end of the study in the Advaxadjuvanted arm. Several different patterns of serologic response to VIT were seen; some subjects had a dominant IgG 4 response, some had a combined IgG 4 and IgG 1 response, and some had an exclusively IgG 1 response. In some subjects specific IgE levels increased during the induction phase and then decreased, whereas in others specific IgE levels progressively decreased from the start of VIT. Conclusion: Advax adjuvant favorably enhanced the immunogenicity of HBVIT, with an early and prolonged switch to specific IgG 4 production. The ability of Advax adjuvant to enhance VIT efficacy warrants further study. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2019;144:504-13.)",

            "text": "Key words: Hymenoptera, anaphylaxis, immunotherapy, IgG 4 , inulin, adjuvant, allergy Anaphylactic reactions to Hymenoptera insect stings are a major clinical problem in many parts of the world. Although venom immunotherapy (VIT) can be effective at preventing life-threatening reactions to future stings, 1-3 it can itself cause severe and even (although rare) life-threatening reactions. It is also less effective for honeybee than Vespula species wasp stings 4 or Myrmecia pilosula (jack jumper ant) stings, the second most common cause of sting anaphylaxis in South Australia. 3 Furthermore, during the course of honeybee venom immunotherapy (HBVIT), immediate systemic reactions, including mild anaphylactic reactions, are common. In large US 4 and European 5 studies, the rate of systemic reactions was 40% for subjects undergoing HBVIT. This is similar to the systemic reactions we saw to VIT with jumper ant venom, where the rate was 34% 3 by comparison to the lower rate of systemic reaction rates to VIT with vespid venoms in Northern Hemisphere studies. 4, 5 The median time taken to achieve a maintenance dose of HBVIT was 14 weeks in a US study of outpatient VIT, 6 which is comparable with our experience of about 10 weeks with cluster regimens. Attempts to accelerate the achievement of maintenance doses using ''ultrarush'' inpatient regimens have had variable effects on reaction rates, interpretation of which is confounded by comparisons being nonrandomized and generally noncontemporaneous, but with some studies suggesting that reaction rates to VIT are even greater on such regimens. 7, 8 Reactions to HBVIT are generally more severe and frequent than for vespid VIT. 9 A minority of subjects receiving HBVIT do not achieve a maintenance dose of HBVIT, this proportion being quoted as 9% in the retrospective study of Lockey et al 6 but in our experience more typically in the range of 5%, leaving this subgroup more susceptible to recurrent sting-induced anaphylaxis. 10 Even when subjects have been established on dose regimens for which there is literature evidence of high probability of protection from sting-induced anaphylaxis, questions remain regarding the optimal duration of VIT. There is a propensity, once VIT has been ceased, for the susceptibility to sting-induced anaphylaxis to recur with each further sting. 11, 12 The 2016 update of the US Practice Parameters suggests that VIT can be discontinued after 5 years in ''low-risk'' patients (2/3 of patients on VIT) who will have a less than 3% chance of systemic reaction to subsequent stings, whereas extended or indefinite treatment is suggested for ''high-risk'' patients (about 1/3 of patients) who have a greater than 40% chance of relapse. 13 There is limited evidence that abolition of detectable specific IgE responses to the venom is a marker for protection from sting-induced anaphylaxis. In the studies by Golden's group, 14, 15 only a minority of subjects lost skin test reactivity to venom after 5 to 8 years of VIT. After approximately 6 years of VIT, only 25% had negative skin test responses, whereas 70% of responses became negative after 9.6 years of follow-up. 15 Thus up to one third of subjects might either need to indefinitely continue VIT, to continue to carry automated adrenaline syringes, or both.",

            "text": "In Australia the commercially available honeybee venom in general use is Albey Bee Venom (Apis mellifera; Hollister-Stier, Spokane, Wash), which is a soluble extract. Several European studies have administered Hymenoptera venoms with alum adjuvant. [16] [17] [18] Although alum reduced local adverse reactions to VIT, presumably by binding and delaying allergen release, it has not been shown to accelerate desensitization or reduce the required venom dose. Alum also has potential disadvantages for allergy therapy given its propensity to enhance IgE production and eosinophilia, the opposite of what is desired from an ideal allergy immunotherapy adjuvant. 19 Advax (Vaxine Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia) is a new adjuvant derived from the natural plant-based polysaccharide delta inulin, which was developed through the National Institutes of Health's Adjuvant Development Program. 19 Advax has been shown to provide enhanced vaccine immunogenicity and antigen sparing while having low reactogenicity. 20 It drives a strong T H 1 response that might help suppress any excess T H 2 bias in allergic patients. Notably, when formulated with Advax, vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were able to suppress eosinophilic lung pathology after SARS coronavirus infection, whereas this problem was aggravated by formulation of SARS vaccine with the TH2-biasing alum adjuvant. 20 Advax adjuvant has been shown to be safe and effective in human vaccine trials, [21] [22] [23] [24] and we sought, therefore, to test the hypothesis that Advax adjuvant would enhance the effectiveness of HBVIT.",

Because the combination with Advax adjuvant was not a licensed product, after 30 months of maintenance therapy, subjects were exited from their blinded randomized therapy and offered conventional VIT immunotherapy at 100 mg/mo for 5 years or indefinitely, depending on the severity of past sting reactions. Patients who withdrew because of changed work circumstances and had reached maintenance doses were offered opportunities to complete conventional VIT treatment in community-based settings.

By contrast, in the SHBVIT group, peak specific IgG 4 levels were lower and rapidly waned back toward baseline levels even with ongoing maintenance therapy. This is consistent with a study that showed only modest~3-fold increases from baseline in specific IgG 4 levels after 2 years of standard VIT with~2-fold reductions in specific IgE levels. 49 It remains unclear whether the increase in specific IgG 4 levels or the decrease in specific IgE levels is more relevant to VIT clinical efficacy. This might reflect the previous difficulty in inducing sufficiently high blocking IgG 4 , a problem that our study suggests can be solved by incorporating Advax adjuvant into VIT. In the clinical response to grass pollen immunotherapy, functional assays of IgG 4 -associated inhibitory activity, such as inhibition of IgE-allergen interactions and inhibition of CD23-dependent IgE-facilitated allergen binding, correlated better with clinical outcome than immunoreactive IgG 4 levels. 50 Hence it will be interesting in future studies of Advax-adjuvanted VIT to also include functional assays of IgG 4 -associated inhibitory activity.",

This continued long-term decrease in specific IgE levels might reflect natural death over time of IgE-producing plasmablasts together with failure to replace these because of depletion of the memory B-cell compartment required to replenish IgE 1 plasmablasts and/ or the effect of regulatory T cells preventing the generation of IgE-producing B cells. In the future, it would be interesting to test whether functional assays of serum inhibitory activity are greater in subjects receiving Advax and also to directly measure the frequency of specific IgE-and IgG 4 -positive memory B cells throughout the course of VIT.",

For example, a previous study in nonallergic beekeepers showed the presence of bee venom-specific, IgG 4 -positive, IL-10-expressing regulatory B cells, with these regulatory B cells also being found to be increased in allergic subjects after VIT. 53 Hence the higher specific IgG 4 levels in the AHBVIT group might reflect an effect of Advax adjuvant on expansion of IL-10 1 regulatory T cells and regulatory B cells making IL-10 and IgG 4 .

Based on the IgE response, 2 different patterns emerged between subject receiving VIT, with 1 group (pattern 1) showing almost immediate decreases in specific IgE levels after commencement of VIT with absence of an initial increase in IgE level (Figs E9 and E10 ). The other group (pattern 2) showed a large (>2-fold) increase in specific IgE levels between weeks 5 and 9 of the initiation of VIT, and IgE did not decrease to pre-VIT levels until after 6 to 12 months of maintenance VIT. Approximately half the subjects in the SHBVIT and AHBVIT groups fell into each category. In Figs E9 and E10, pink arrows represent systemic immediate hypersensitivity reactions to VIT, and black arrows indicate incidental bee stings, none of which resulted in systemic reactions. Surprisingly, the majority of subjects experiencing systemic immediate hypersensitivity reactions to VIT were concentrated in the pattern 1 groups. Although analysis of baseline data showed that mean specific IgG 4 levels at baseline were more than 4-fold greater in subjects in pattern 1 (mean specific IgG 4 , 4.13; SD, 6.13) versus pattern 2 (mean specific IgG 4 , 0.915; SD, 1.6), this difference did not reach statistical significance (P 5 .088, Mann-Whitney test). It was noticeable that subjects having multiple stings in a short space of time (eg, subjects 8, 14, and 21) had a major increase in their specific IgE levels immediately after this, suggesting repeat priming or boosting of IgE 1 B-cell memory responses. The specific total IgG ELISA assay was noted to have a high background relative to specific IgG 1 and IgG 4 ELISAs for reasons that were not clear. Nevertheless, specific total IgG levels increased in most subjects after commencement of VIT and then stayed high or slowly waned over the 3 years of VIT. Interestingly, specific total IgG levels in some subjects remained increased above baseline values, even when specific IgG 1 and IgG 4 levels were low or undetectable, suggesting that the specific total IgG assay might be much more sensitive than either the IgG 1 or IgG 4 assays alone.",
