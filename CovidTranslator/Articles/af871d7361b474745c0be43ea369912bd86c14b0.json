For example, up to the end of 2004, the European Patent Office granted 2,913 patents containing the term 'nucleic acid' in the claims, and 549 of these were granted in 2004 alone. The omnipresence of genetic patents has raised serious concerns about access to and use of genome-related inventions, as the expansion of genetic patents might result in a patent thicket. As it is unlikely that patents for genetic inventions will be carved out from patent law, it is extremely important to develop alternative strategies to maximize access to and use of genetic inventions. Some models already exist for facilitating access to patented gene technology. Research exemptions create access for research purposes, and licensing agreements and compulsory licences are well-known tools for encouraging access. Other models that could render proprietary genetic inventions accessible for further use are under discussion, such as patent pools and clearing-house mechanisms. Patent pools and clearing-house mechanisms have been suggested by various governmental and non-governmental organizations as useful mechanisms to deal with the specific problems of access and use of patented genes, diagnostic methods, technologies and tools that are used in genetics.",

The original provision, which was laid down in the Community Patent Convention, states that the rights that are conferred by a patent shall not extend to \"acts done for experimental purposes relating to the subject-matter of the patented invention\". The equivalent provisions in the European member-states mirror but sometimes also deviate from this wording. Because different national legislations and court rulings exist, the exact scope of the exemption differs from country to country. There seems to be a general consensus that the exemption applies irrespective of the way the patented subject matter has been put into operation and the place of the experiment, be it a public laboratory, hospital or private company. But doubts arise about the scale, nature (experiments 'on' versus experiments 'with' the patented subject matter) and final purpose of the experiment (commercial versus non-commercial goal), and whether these fall within the exemption [1] [2] [3] [4] . At present, it is unclear to what extent the research exemption can shield diagnostic testing. On the one hand, one could argue that diagnostic testing falls within the research exemption, because patient blood or tissue sampling is often necessary to do research. On the other hand, one could claim that diagnostic testing cannot fall within the exemption because once a diagnostic test is established, the act of diagnosis could be defined as and/or confined to the act of providing the referring medical doctor with an opinion as to whether or not the patient carries a deleterious mutation.",

In the landmark case Madey v. Duke University 5 -which in fact involved electron laser technology, not genetics -it was recalled that: \"Regardless of whether a particular institution or entity is engaged in an endeavour for commercial gain, so long as the act is in furtherance of the alleged infringer's legitimate business and is not solely for amusement, to satisfy idle curiosity, or for strict philosophical inquiry, the act does not qualify for the very narrow and strictly limited experimental use defence. \" Furthermore, the profit or nonprofit status of the user is not decisive for the applicability of the doctrine. Research projects that are financed by major research universities but that have no prospect of commercialization further the institution's legitimate business objectives, including: \"educating and enlightening students and faculty participating in these projects\", and \"serve to increase the status of the institution and lure lucrative research grants, students and faculty\" 5 . This means that, after the Madey v. Duke University case, universities can no longer invoke experimental use in their defence. Concerns have been raised about this extremely limited interpretation by the US Federal Circuit of the experimental-use theory 6, 7 . In practice, however, the research exemption is administered more flexibly because companies hardly ever sue universities 8 .",

Integra -a case about the use of the Arg-Gly-Asp (or RGD) tripeptide in cell-adhesion experiments -that the use of patented inventions in preclinical research, the results of which are not ultimately included in a submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), also falls within the scope of this exemption 10 . This interpretation of the exemption that is defined in the Hatch-Waxman act seems to be broad when compared with the limited interpretation of the common law experimental-use exemption in the Madey v. Duke University case. However, one should take into consideration the limited scope of application of this statutory exemption: it only applies to research that is related to drug development. It remains to be seen to what extent this case will influence the interpretation of the common law experimental-use exemption.",

Licences are provided to the licensee, either directly by the patentee, or indirectly through a new entity that is specifically set up for the administration of the pool [17] [18] [19] .

Patent pools might have significant benefits: elimination of stacking licences 17 ; reduction of licensing transaction costs through the introduction of a system of 'onestop licensing' for non-member licensees; decrease in patent litigation; and institutionalized exchange of technical information that is not covered by patents, through a mechanism for sharing technical information relating to the patented technology, which would otherwise be kept as a trade secret 17, 19, 20 .

For activities that do not fall under the research exemption, licensing is probably used most regularly to gain access to patented technology, at least when not too many patent holders are concerned. Patent-pool schemes and clearing-house models might be helpful to settle the presence of multiple patents and multiple patent holders and offer a solution for inventors who wish to gain access to a patent thicket.

Critics of gene patents argue that DNA and its implicit informational basis represents an irreducible constituent or law of nature, which, under existing United States (US) and European Union (EU) law, is not statutory subject matter. Some have highlighted as especially problematic gene patents that stake claims to basic genetic research, genetic testing and gene therapy 1-3 . This interpretation of the law contrasts with the permissive practices of the US Patent and Trademark Office and European Patent Office, which currently allow broad patents on partial and complete genes, genomes and even social or ethnic classifications of DNA, such as Ashkenazi-specific gene sequences 4, 5 .",
