A RT-PCR/ESI-MS respiratory virus surveillance kit designed to detect respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1-4, adenoviridae types A-F, coronaviridae, human bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus was evaluated using both mock-ups and frozen archived NPA (N=280), 95 of which were positive by clinical virology methods. RT-PCR/ESI-MS detected 74/95 (77.9%) known positive samples and identified an additional 13/185 (7%) from culture negative samples. Viruses that are non-detectable with conventional methods were also identified. Viral load was semi-quantifiable and ranged from 2,400 to >320,000copies/ml. Time to results was 8hrs. RT-PCR/ESI-MS showed promise in rapid detection of respiratory viruses, merits further evaluation for use in clinical settings.",

Accurate mass (61 ppm), high-resolution (M/dM.100,000 Full-Width Half-Maximum) mass spectra were acquired for each sample using highthroughput ESI-MS protocols described previously (Sampath et al., 2007) . For each sample, approximately 1.5 uL of analyte solution was consumed during the 74-second spectral acquisition. Raw mass spectra were post-calibrated with an internal mass standard and deconvolved to monoisotopic molecular masses. Unambiguous base compositions were derived from the exact mass measurements of the complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides. Semi-quantitative results of pathogens were obtained by comparing the peak heights with the internal PCR calibration internal mass standard present in every PCR well at 100 molecules, which was also treated as the internal positive control in each well. A negative control was implemented in each batch of processing with sterile viral transport media as well.",

The number of 'evaluable results' was operationally defined for purposes of primary and secondary performance evaluation as the number of individual evaluable results which could be compared to one another, since each NPA sample could yield test results (by culture or RT-PCR/MS-ESI) of 'negative', single positive, or multiple viral detections (Figure 2 ). In the secondary analysis, we combined clinical virology laboratory results and the secondary (i.e. Luminex) PCR-based results as the reference test. Samples containing viruses for which the hospital's clinical virology laboratory had no protocol available (i.e. bocavirus and coronavirus detection) were excluded from the primary analysis but included in the secondary analysis if the viral agent could be detected by the other (Luminex) RT-PCR-based method (i.e. all viruses except bocavirus). Confidence intervals for sensitivity, and specificity were based on exact binomial probabilities. Two-sample Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test was used for comparing the viral load in the clinical virology positive group with the negative group.",

            "text": "We recognize several limitations of our design. First, the operation of RT-PCR/ESI-MS was performed almost a year after the initial tests done in clinical virology. Utilizing \"excess\" NPA obtained from clinical virology resulted in some specimens not being processed until more than a year after collecting them from patients. Although the effect of length of storage of NPA has been shown to be minimal within 2 months (Ward et al., 2004) , the impact of longer periods of storage remains unknown. Ward et al. demonstrated that multiple freezing thawing cycles did not significantly alter the concentrations measured prior to freezing the influenza samples (Ward et al., 2004) , while Frisbie et al. indicated influenza RNA could degrade in the -70\u00b0C freezer and may result in some loss of sensitivity (Frisbie et al., 2004) . The second limitation is that we could not send every specimen for secondary analyses due to insufficient volume of some samples. This is an inherent limitation of the retrospective design used here. However, since almost half of the discordant results verified by another PCR-based method (12 out of 25), it might have little impact on the estimate. Future study is merited to perform parallel comparison on every sample by another reference tests (e.g. another PCR based method) in order to better characterize the performance of the platform. Thirdly, we could not test the performance of RT-PCR/ESI-MS on every subtype of clinical revelant respiratory viruses because of the design of the study. For those viral subtypes not demonstrated in this pilot study (i.e. parainfluenza type 2 and 4, adenovirus type A and D-F), further study will be required to determine the performance of this novel platform. Lastly, we only performed five repeats in the LOD experiment, in which we utilized the 100% detection (5/5) criteria to determine the LOD but not the 95% detection rule that generally applied in LOD studies. Althought the fewer repeats in our study may have limitation in precision of the LODs, the 100% detection still should be considered a conservative estimate in this pilot study that could provide some evidence for futher studies.",

Detection of conventional viruses missed by clinical virology and unconventional viruses required additional confirmatatory testing to further determine the performance characteristics. The RT-PCR/ESI-MS method is a promising diagnostic platform for the rapid identification of conventional and unconventional viruses and merits further prospective evaluation. Diagnostic algorithm used in clinical virology laboratory to detect respiratory viruses mainly divided into respiratory season or non-respiratory season. Respiratory season defined as October to the following January (October to November for RSV, December to January for influenza). Immunochromatographic assays were used in respiratory season as the sole screening test for RSV and influenza, which will stop the testing algorithm if results are positive. Respiratory panel cocktail DFA tests serve for adenovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza type 1-3 and RSV, which will stop the testing algorithm if results are positive in non-respiratory season or for those screened negative by immunochromatographic assays in respiratory season as well. Bocavirus that were not detectable in both clinical virology laboratory and another PCRbased platform were excluded (N=7). After further excluding 14 coronavirus and 3 humane metapneumovirusdetections that clinical virology laboratory had no protocol to detect, 257 were included in the primary performance analysis as in table 1. Twenty-five samples for which clinical virology laboratory and RT-PCR/ESI-MS did not agree or clinical virology laboratory has no protocol to detect with sufficient volume left were sent to another PCRbased assay for secondary analysis. Seven clinically relevant viral pathogens (coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, parainfluenza type 2 and 3, adenovirus, and coronavirus (SARS)) were spiked into pooled negative NPAs tested by RT-PCR/ESI-MS to determine the limit of detection (LOD) with five repeats of serial of 2-fold dilutions from 1000 to 1 copies/well (1.3x 105 to 133 copies/ml). The RT-PCR/ESI-MS was most sensitive in detecting adenovirus (LOD: 7 copies/well) and least sensitive in detecting RSV (LOD: 150 copies/ well). One copies/well is approximate to 133 copies/ml. Overall agreement, sensitivity, and specificity, excluding those non-conventional viruses for which JHU has no identification protocols were 87.9 %, 77.9% and 92.1%, respectively.",
