It has been estimated that 2.5 million cases of pneumonia occur annually in Europe [2] . The most recent incidence figures from the developed world come from an Australian study carried out in 2003 [3] . A diagnosis of pneumonia was reported in 6.8% of children. The estimated incidence of pneumonia in the study sample was 7.6/1000 person-years. Radiological confirmation was reported in 85% and hospitalisation in 41%. The estimated incidence of pneumonia requiring hospitalisation was 3.1/1000 person-years. This study is difficult to compare with other incidence studies as it used as parental recall and a denominator of person-years. If the incidence is calculated using persons rather than person-years, the rate of pneumonia in the < 5 year age group would be 21/1000/year. European figures taken from a study conducted in Finland found a higher incidence, 36/1000/year for children < 5 years of age and 16.2/1000/year for children > 5 years (hospital and community combined). However, the number of cases requiring hospitalisation is very similar (41% in the Australian study and 42% in the Finnish study [4] ).",

(The ONS collects mortality data from all deaths in the UK and publishes them according to ICD-10 codes). A total of 13 deaths from invasive pneumococcal disease were reported to the ONS in 1999, 3 of which were due to pneumonia. In addition, a further 77 deaths due to pneumonia were reported due to unspecified septicaemia. An underlying condition, such as cerebral palsy or prematurity, was present in 34/77 (44%). It can be seen that these numbers are very low when considered in the context of the number of children who suffer from pneumonia each year.",

Fast breathing (defined as \u2265 60 breaths/min in infants < 2 months; \u2265 50 breaths in infants 2 months to 1 year, and \u2265 40 breaths in children aged 1 -5 years) and the presence of chest in-drawing are used to make a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia and make management decisions on the use of antibiotics and admission to hospital. Perhaps the most important drug used in the treatment of childhood pneumonia, is oxygen. Irrespective of the organism responsible, simple clinical signs predict hypoxaemia in children with pneumonia in the developing world [8] . The use of a simple case management protocol can reduce the case fatality rate for childhood pneumonia and much of this improvement is related to the early and appropriate use of oxygen [9] .",

More importantly, the WHO sells a teaching package with examples of chest radiographs that have been reported under this system as having infiltrates or consolidation; this allows clinicians running studies to follow the same system. A study by Davies [12] agreed with the basis for this system. They demonstrated a high level of intra-and inter-observer agreement for the presence of consolidation (weighed \u03ba = 0.91 for intra-observer agreement) and also found a high level of agreement between radiologists that consolidation represents pneumonic change (\u03ba = 0.92).",

Consolidation historically thought to be associated with bacterial pneumonia was seen in 72% of those with a bacterial infection. In children with solely viral pneumonia, 50% had consolidation. Interstitial changes are thought to be more associated with viral infections; however, 50% of children in this group had evidence of a viral infection, whereas the other 50% had bacterial infection. Many children had a mixed picture of radiological changes. These findings were confirmed in a systematic review by Swingler [16] , who concluded that it was not possible to differentiate between viral and bacterial pneumonia radiologically. The radiological diagnosis of pneumonia is further complicated by anecdotal evidence that suggests the chest radiograph can be normal in the early stages of the disease.",

One study found a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 88% [21] . However, other researchers have found a lower sensitivity of 50% for procalcitonin in the detection of bacterial pneumonia [22] .

There were many aetiology studies in the developing world in the 1970s and 1980s using lung aspirate. If the results from these studies are pooled, bacteria were isolated in 456 (55%) of the 835 aspirates examined [6] . This figure may be falsely low as some children were pre-treated with antibiotics and the affected part of the lung may not always have been sampled. In the developing world, Streptoccocus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae account for more than two thirds of all bacterial isolates.

In children aged 5 -15, S. pneumonia fell to 5.4/1000 and M. pneumoniae rose to 6.6/1000. Other studies have found different results.

In an aetiology study by Mickelow [31] , 35/154 children had M. pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae, 47% of which were < 5 years.

This area was the subject of a recent Cochrane review, which sought to identify effective antibiotic drug therapies for CAP in children by comparing various antibiotics [37] . RCTs comparing antibiotics for CAP in children were included if they used the case definition of pneumonia (as given by the WHO) or radiologically confirmed pneumonia. A total of 20 studies met the inclusion criteria (many were carried out in the developing world).",

Only 24% of children were treated with benzyl penicillin. The prospective arm of the study instigated a new management protocol that promoted the use of benzyl penicillin, followed by the addition of a macrolide at 48 h for those not responding. A total of 89 children were included in the prospective audit and 61/89 (69%) were treated with benzyl penicillin (there were reasons for giving broader spectrum antibiotics, such as immunodeficiency, in 10 children).

In this adequately powered randomised controlled equivalence trial, 246 children were randomised to oral amoxicillin or intravenous benzyl penicillin. Robust criteria were used for the diagnosis of pneumonia (fever, respiratory symptoms or signs and consolidation on the chest radiograph agreed by two independent radiologists). The primary outcome measure was time for temperature to settle (median 1.3 days in both groups). Median time to complete resolution of symptoms was 9 days in both groups. Three children in the oral group were changed to intravenous antibiotics. The study concluded that the majority of children admitted to hospital (all but those with the severest disease) should be treated with oral amoxicillin. This has implications for reducing the pain and distress of treatment for children and families and also the cost. 8.3 .1 Switch therapy 'Switch therapy' (also known as 'sequential antimicrobial therapy') is a concept that has been advocated in patients with pneumonia and consists of shorter administration of antibiotics by the intravenous route, usually around 1 -2 days, followed by a longer course of oral antibiotics. There have been no RCTs in the developed world to study this concept in children. The only information in this area is from two observational studies carried out following introduction of new management protocols. Both studies concluded that intravenous antibiotic administration could be successfully reduced from a mean of 5.6 to 1.7 days in one study [53] and 6 to 3 days in another [54] .",
