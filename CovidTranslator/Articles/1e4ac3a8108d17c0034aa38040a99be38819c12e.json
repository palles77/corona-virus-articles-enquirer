The attachment of Ub to a substrate protein typically occurs via the formation of an isopeptide bond that links the C-terminal carboxy group of Ub with the \u03b5-amino group of a lysine residue in the substrate (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998; Pickart, 2001) . Ub itself contains seven lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, K63) and an N-terminal methionine (M1) that can serve as attachment sites for another Ub resulting in the formation of Ub chains (polyUb). Thus, lysines on proteins can be modified with a single Ub, monoubiquitylation, or with polyUb of different linkage types. Importantly, polyUb of different linkage types signal different functional outcomes, thus making ubiquitylation a versatile PTM (Yau and Rape, 2016) .",

            "text": "As it is used as a signal in so many different cellular processes, it is important for ubiquitylation to be tightly regulated. Indeed, ubiquitylation is a dynamic modification that is reversed by dedicated proteases called deubiquitinases, or DUBs. There are approximately 100 human DUBs that until recently were classified into five distinct families (Clague et al., 2013; Ronau et al., 2016) . Recently, a sixth family of DUBs (MINDY family) was discovered (Abdul Rehman et al., 2016) , and these MINDY DUBs show exquisite selectivity in cleaving K48-linked polyUb. Such linkage selectivity is present in few other DUBs, whereas the vast majority of DUBs are non-selective and will cleave all types of polyUb (Faesen et al., 2011; Mevissen et al., 2013) . Linkage selective DUBs cleave within chains to trim the polyUb and can thereby edit the Ub signal (Komander et al., 2009) . Such DUBs therefore rely on recognition of both distal Ub (S1) and proximal Ub (S1 0 ) of a diUb positioned across the catalytic site to achieve specificity of cleavage. Being important regulators of the Ub system, DUBs are increasingly implicated in human disease, and, as a result, there has been considerable interest in recent years in exploring DUBs as drug targets (Leznicki and Kulathu, 2017) .",

            "text": "One cellular process where ubiquitylation plays important roles is the DNA damage response (DDR), a cellular signal transduction pathway that functions to maintain the integrity of DNA (Jackson and Durocher, 2013) . Ubiquitylation has emerged as a key regulatory mechanism to orchestrate protein signaling within the DDR, with arguably the best-characterized DDR pathway being the cellular response to double-strand breaks (DSBs). Ub signaling during DSB repair is driven by the E3 Ub ligases RNF8 and RNF168, which mainly catalyze K63-linked polyUb on histones and possibly other chromatin-associated proteins (Schwertman et al., 2016) . In addition to histones, ubiquitylation of specific protein targets is often associated with activation of particular DDR pathways. For example, ubiquitylation of the DNA replication sliding clamp PCNA and the single-stranded binding protein RPA occurs in response to DNA replication stress (Garc\u00eda-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2016) . Functionally, RPA ubiquitylation has been suggested to promote homologous recombination (HR) at stalled forks, which may be due to inappropriate retention of RPA on single-stranded DNA, thereby inhibiting downstream RAD51 loading and HR (Feeney et al., 2017; Inano et al., 2017) . Collectively, the above examples illustrate the multifaceted manner by which Ub-dependent signaling mechanisms function to promote the DDR and maintain genome stability. Importantly, with the widespread roles for ubiquitylation in the DDR, this process is also tightly regulated by DUBs, many of which have been reported to regulate various genome maintenance pathways (Kee and Huang, 2015) .",

Further, the architecture of the catalytic domain is unique among DUBs. Based on these observations, we classify ZUFSP as the seventh family of human DUBs. Interestingly, ZUFSP binds to several proteins involved in DNA replication and repair and indeed detailed analyses reveal ZUFSP as a regulator of genome stability.",

            "text": "Activity-Based Profiling Identifies ZUFSP as a Putative DUB Since our recent discovery of a new family of DUBs (Abdul Rehman et al., 2016) , we sought to determine whether there were other yet-to-be identified DUBs. Ub-based suicide probes have been instrumental in the identification of several DUBs (Hewings et al., 2017) . We therefore established a sensitive and robust pipeline using chemical probes in combination with proteomic approaches to isolate and identify DUBs from cell extracts (Figures 1A and 1B) . Using propargylated Ub (Ub-Prg), a potent and selective modifier of DUBs , we set up an optimized pipeline to maximize recovery of DUBs, with which we capture the majority of cysteinebased DUBs (Figures 1C and S1A-S1C). When performed with lysates from two different cell lines, we captured a unique set of DUBs from each cell line. The robustness of the pipeline established here is also highlighted by the presence of MINDY DUBs, which had previously not been identified using Ub-based suicide probes. Intriguingly, we repeatedly observed the presence of ZUFSP (Zinc finger with UFM1-specific peptidase domain protein) in our pull-downs ( Figure S1D ). UFM1 is an important Ub-like modifier whose functional roles are still poorly understood (Daniel and Liebau, 2014) . However, ZUFSP is thought to be an inactive UFM1 peptidase as it lacks a key catalytic residue ( Figure 1F ). To rule out that ZUFSP was a contaminant in our Ub suicide probe pull-downs, we expressed and purified the catalytic domain of ZUFSP and monitored its activity toward Ub-Prg. Indeed, the predicted catalytic domain of ZUFSP is readily modified by Ub-Prg ( Figures 1D and 1E ). In contrast, ZUFSP is not modified by UFM1-Prg suggesting that ZUFSP may be a Ub-specific protease ( Figures 1D and S1E) . A sequence alignment of ZUFSP with the other known Ufm1 proteases Ufsp1 and Ufsp2, however, reveals that the His residue that is part of the catalytic triad of both Ufsp1 and Ufsp2 is missing in ZUFSP ( Figure 1F ). This raised the question of whether and how ZUFSP could be an active DUB.",

Human ZUFSP is a modular protein comprising 578 amino acids (aa) with four C2H2 type zinc fingers at the N terminus followed by a conserved motif interacting with Ub (MIU) juxtaposed to the catalytic domain (residues 294-578) at the C terminus ( Figure 1E ). However, this minimal catalytic domain was not stable and resisted crystallization. We recently showed that the activity of MINDY1 is greater in the presence of its Ub binding MIU motifs (Abdul Rehman et al., 2016) . We therefore decided to expand the ZUFSP construct boundaries to include the conserved MIU motif, which we hypothesized may be involved in Ub recognition and catalysis. This longer construct (residues 232-578), ZUFSP MIU-Cat , expresses at higher levels and has improved solubility. ZUFSP MIU-Cat was complexed with Ub-Prg and crystals of the complex were obtained at 14 mg/mL. The structure was determined by MAD phasing using selenomethionine substituted ZUFSP and refined to the values shown in Table 1 . This 1.7-\u00c5 resolution crystal structure reveals several unique features about ZUFSP and its unique mode of distal Ub recognition.",

Going from the core domain, a helices 2 and 3 (a2, a3) form the first extension. The second extension created by a1 forms a long helical arm, ZUFSP helical arm (ZHA) that protrudes away from the central domain.

Superposition of UFM1 onto Ub reveals that the b1-b2 loop of UFM1 sterically clashes with the (legend continued on next page) ZHA ( Figures 2J and S2H ). In most DUBs, the flexible C terminus of Ub is stabilized by several interactions in the active site cleft of the DUB. Extensive hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions between R72 and R74 of Ub and D406, Q408, Q412, and E428 stabilize the C terminus of Ub. One important residue is L73 of Ub, which is accommodated in a hydrophobic pocket and is important for catalysis (B\u00e9 k\u00e9 s et al., 2013) . In ZUFSP, this pocket is formed by the aliphatic portions of the side chains of Q487, Q489, Q547, and Q549 ( Figures 2K and S2I ). The equivalent residue of L73 in UFM1 is a negatively charged D80. Another significant difference between Ub and UFM1 lies in the C-terminal tail of the modifiers. The C-terminal residues of Ub, Gly75, and Gly76 are nestled within a narrow catalytic groove ( Figure 2L ). The equivalent residues in Ufm1 are Val82 and Gly83, and the bulky Val82 ( Figure 2M ) cannot be accommodated in this narrow groove, likely explaining why ZUFSP cannot be a UFM1 protease but is instead a DUB.",

The main hydrophobic interactions are mediated by F260, L263, and Y267, which are all positioned on the same face of the ZHA, and these residues are conserved in evolution ( Figures  3B-3D ).

Interestingly, while the Ub-ZHA interface mainly involves hydrophobic and ionic interactions, the interaction between Ub and the catalytic core is predominantly ionic in nature ( Figure 3E ). Many UBDs are helical domains that bind to Ub. Of these, the Ub interaction motif (UIM), MIU, and the double UIM (DUIM) are single helix domains (Hurley et al., 2006) . We therefore compared the mode of interaction of Ub with ZHA, UIM, and MIU ( Figures 3F-3H ). Whereas the interactions of UIM and MIU with the I44 patch of Ub are centered around critical leucine and alanine residues, the key residues in ZHA are ExxxFxxLxxxY ( Figures 3F and 3G ). The mode of interaction of ZHA with Ub is reminiscent of that of MIU. However, compared to MIU, the Ub is rotated, and there is a clear differ-ence in the way the I44 patch binds to the ZHA ( Figure 3H ). The interactions of ZHA with the I44 patch of Ub is mediated by residues distinct from an MIU, and the unique mode of interaction lead us to classify ZHA as a distinct single helix UBD.",

We performed a DUB assay to compare cleavage of tetraUb of seven different linkage types. To our surprise, despite being reactive toward Ub-Prg, neither ZUFSP Cat nor ZUFSP MIU-Cat could cleave any of the polyUbs tested ( Figures 4A and S4A ). While the distal Ub binds to ZHA, an S1 0 binding site for the proximal Ub is not obvious from the structure ( Figure 2A ). The MIU of ZUFSP, which has the conserved residues of a typical MIU motif is only partially ordered in the crystal structure and does not show any interaction with Ub, prompting us to question whether the MIU binds Ub (Figures 2A, 4B , and S2B). Certain MIUs, like that of MINDY1 (Kristariyanto et al., 2017) , can bind to polyUb on their own. In contrast, most other individual MIUs do not bind polyUb and instead work together with other UBDs to enable binding (Husnjak and Dikic, 2012) . When tested for polyUb binding, the MIU-ZHA fusion did not bind to any of the polyUbs tested (Figure 4C) . Addition of MIU-ZHA to the catalytic domain does not confer activity to the DUB. Further, the positioning of the MIU makes it unlikely to be the S1 0 site.",

            "text": "We therefore wondered whether the ZNFs in ZUFSP may bind Ub to provide the S1 0 site and make ZUFSP an active DUB. The MIU-ZHA motifs together with the ZNFs (ZNF1-4) bind weakly to polyUb ( Figure 4D ), suggesting that one or more of the ZNFs bind Ub. To identify the ZNFs responsible for binding, we assayed polyUb binding of combinations or individual ZNFs ( Figures  4D, S4B , S4C, S4D, and S4H). Our systematic analyses revealed that ZNF4 is the dominant polyUb binder in ZUFSP and the MIU may provide weak interactions that, together, form the polyUb binding module of ZUFSP ( Figures S5H-S5J ). These results using tetraUb pull-downs are further supported by pull-downs of ubiquitylated proteins from cell extracts ( Figures S4F and  S4G ). Ub-binding ZNF (UBZ) is a type of Zn 2+ -coordinating b-b-a fold domain found in several proteins involved in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation (Husnjak and Dikic, 2012) . Sequence analyses reveal that ZNF4 is a C2H2 type Zn 2+ finger that is divergent from the well-characterized UBZ domains of POLH and FAAP20 (Toma et al., 2015) ( Figure 4E ), suggesting that ZNF4 of ZUFSP is an atypical UBZ. To further establish that it is a bona fide UBZ, we mutated residues in ZNF4, which we predicted based on sequence analyses to be involved in Ub recognition ( Figure S4E ). Indeed, these mutants completely disrupt polyUb binding, thus supporting the conclusion that ZNF4 is a UBD ( Figure 4F ). S5B , and S5C). It is conceivable that the UBZ may form the proximal Ub binding site thus explaining DUB activity of ZUFSP only in the presence of the UBZ. If this idea is correct, then we predict that changing the location of the UBZ would hinder its positioning and thereby its role as the S1 0 site. Indeed, changing the position of UBZ by fusing it to the C terminus of ZUFSP resulted in loss of DUB activity, supporting our notion that the UBZ may form the proximal Ub binding site ( Figure S5A ). Importantly, mutating residues in the UBZ that disrupt Ub binding ( highlighting the importance of the UBZ domain for the enzyme activity of ZUFSP. Furthermore, our finding that the UBZ is required for DUB activity allowed us to test mutants to validate our observations based on the crystal structure using DUB assays. Mutation of C360, H491, D512, or Q487 to Ala completely abolished catalytic activity, supporting the insights from the crystal structure that C360, H491, and D512 are the main catalytic residues and Q487 forms the oxyanion hole ( Figures 5D and S5D) . Mutating Y267 and L269 to Ala also abolished DUB activity, highlighting the importance of the ZHA and distal Ub binding for catalysis ( Figure 5D ). In summary, the UBDs in ZUFSP we have here identified, the ZHA and UBZ, form the distal and the putative proximal Ub binding sites, respectively, to together enable the DUB to selectively cleave K63-linked polyUb ( Figure 5G ).",

Next, we immunoprecipitated endogenous ZUFSP from the nuclear fractions of HEK293 cells and performed mass spectrometry analysis to identify interacting proteins. Interestingly, pathway analysis revealed that several of the identified ZUFSP interactors are proteins that regulate DNA replication and repair ( Figures 6A, 6B , S6E, and S6F). To interrogate the involvement of ZUFSP in the latter, we first monitored whether it localizes to sites of DNA damage, as this is a hallmark of proteins involved in DNA repair. Interestingly, ZUFSP is rapidly recruited to DNA lesions following laser microirradiation (within 1 min) and also persists for more than 3 hr (Figure 6C ). Next, to determine whether Ub signaling impacts ZUFSP recruitment, cells were pre-treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which reduces free Ub pools and impairs Ub signaling at DNA lesions (Dantuma et al., 2006) . Proteasome inhibition leads to a marked inhibition of total and K63-linked polyUb ( Figures  S6A and S6C ), which correlated with a marked reduction of YFP-ZUFSP accrual at DNA lesions, suggesting a largely Ubdependent component of ZUFSP recruitment ( Figure 6D ). Given our above finding that ZUFSP is a K63-specific DUB, we genetically ablated UBC13, the Ub-conjugating (E2) enzyme that generates majority of the K63-linked polyUb in response to DNA damage ( Figure S6D ). We found that loss of K63-linked polyUb impairs optimal recruitment of YFP-ZUFSP to DNA lesions but is not the only determinant for its localization to damage sites, in line with our in vitro findings that ZUFSP can bind multiple pol-yUb types ( Figures 6E, 4D , S6B, S5H, and S5I). Collectively, these findings suggest that ZUFSP is a putative DNA repair and/or replication factor involved in Ub signaling at DNA lesions.",

We consistently observed that cells depleted of ZUFSP exhibit increased chromatin loading of the DNA damage protein 53BP1 together with increased gH2AX signaling, suggesting that ZUFSP depleted cells undergo spontaneous DNA damage ( Figure 7B ). Quantitative image-based cytometry (QIBC) (Toledo et al., 2013) analysis of total gH2AX and 53BP1 signal in the chromatin fraction revealed a consistent DNA damage phenotype upon ZUFSP depletion using the entire panel of siRNAs (Figures 7C and S7A) . A previous RPA proteomic screen identified ZUFSP in RPA co-immunoprecipitates (Tk\u00e1 c et al., 2016), which we also confirmed ( Figure S7B ). However, ZUFSP recruitment to DNA lesions was independent of prior RPA loading, as depletion of CtIP did not impact YFP-ZUFSP recruitment to DNA lesions (Figure S7C) . Based on our identification of DNA replication and repair factors in the ZUFSP interactome ( Figure 6A ) and the interaction with RPA, we reasoned that the DNA damage phenotype might have arisen from problems encountered during DNA replication. Using cyclin A as a marker for S/G 2 -phase and 53BP1 as a DNA damage marker, we observed that both G 1 -and S/G 2phase cells displays increased 53BP1 signal in ZUFSP depleted cells, indicative of increased DNA breaks in both these cell-cycle phases ( Figure 7D ). To extend these findings further, we used QIBC analysis to determine how the 53BP1 signal varied across the cell cycle from thousands of single cells ( Figure 7E ). Quantification of total 53BP1 signal, as measured from the sum of 53BP1 foci intensity per nucleus, revealed the highest 53BP1 levels in G 1 -and S-phases, which suggest that DNA damage suffered during ongoing DNA replication is inefficiently repaired in ZUFSP depleted cells and transmitted to the next cell cycle ( Figure 7E ). Next, we engineered cells lines to inducibly express either wild-type (WT) or catalytically inactive (C360S) siRNAresistant ZUFSP alleles (Figures S7D, S5D, and S7E ). While WT ZUFSP effectively rescued the DNA damage phenotype in ZUFSP depleted cells, the C360S mutant was unable to, suggesting that the DUB activity of ZUFSP is required to prevent spontaneous DNA damage in cells ( Figure 7F ). Last, we analyzed the resilience of ZUFSP depleted cells to exogenous DNA damage reagents. Relative to controls, ZUFSP depleted cells displayed increased sensitivity to both ionizing radiation (IR) and the chemotherapeutic drug camptothecin (CPT; topoisomerase I inhibitor) ( Figures 7G and 7H) , underlining a broader role for ZUFSP in DNA repair. Collectively, our data suggest that ZUFSP is a distinct DUB class that plays an important role in maintaining genome stability both during normal ongoing DNA replication and in response to exogenous DNA damage.",

Such probes have been instrumental in the identification of DUBs and in investigating Ub signaling (Borodovsky et al., 2002; Jahan et al., 2016) . However, the recent development of better probes , and our development of a more robust approach, led to the identification of ZUFSP as a putative DUB. Further, we identify distinct subsets of DUBs in different cell lines. Such powerful unbiased analyses of DUB activity in different tissues and primary cells has the potential to provide insights into regulation of Ub signaling in specific cell types and in response to different cellular stimuli. Our identification of another family of DUBs highlights that there is much more to be learned about the Ub system. Notably, the use of DUB probes is presently limited to thiol proteases and the development of probes that work with metalloproteases will significantly advance our understanding of regulation of metallo-DUB activity and may also reveal hitherto unknown Ub-specific metalloproteases.",

            "text": "Our results point to important roles for ZUFSP in the cellular response to replication stress. Hence, it is conceivable that the activity of ZUFSP has to be regulated. Being a modular protein, we suggest that there are several layers of regulation controlling the activity of ZUFSP. We have here identified two unannotated UBDs within ZUFSP, the helical ZHA juxtaposed to the catalytic domain that binds the distal Ub and the UBZ domain that binds polyUb. These findings increase the number of known UBDs and the ways by which Ub signals are decoded. We propose that the UBZ forms the S1 0 site to make ZUFSP a functional DUB. Intriguingly, the UBZ is an atypical one that binds polyUb and so it is likely that it has two Ub binding sites located within the same domain, reminiscent of Npl4 ZNF ( small domains that are capable of binding polyUb on their own (Husnjak and Dikic, 2012) . Surprisingly, the annotated UBD, i.e., the MIU motif, despite having all the canonical residues of a typical MIU motif, does not bind strongly to Ub. One possibility is that this MIU is a weak Ub binder that on its own does not bind Ub. The positioning of the MIU adjacent to ZHA suggests that it may serve as the S2 binding site. Interestingly, modeling a complete MIU-Ub interaction in ZUFSP positions the Ub in such a way that the C terminus of the Ub bound to MIU points toward K63 of the ZHA-bound Ub. Distance restraints suggest that only a K63-linked diUb can bind to ZHA-MIU, making it further likely that the MIU forms the S2 binding site ( Figure S7F ). Indeed, mutation of the MIU to disrupt Ub binding impacts on the efficiency of ZUFSP to cleave polyUb ( Figures S5E and S5F) . DUBs depend to varying extents on the different Ub binding sites they have (Mevissen and Komander, 2017) . For instance, the S2 site in the DUB SARS PLpro is a dominant Ub binder and dictates specificity and activity of the DUB (B\u00e9 k\u00e9 s et al., 2016). In contrast, our data show that ZUFSP relies more on S1 and S1 0 Ub recognition, with a minor contribution from the proposed S2 binding site. Having unequivocally demonstrated that ZUFSP is a DUB and not a UFM1 peptidase, we propose renaming ZUFSP to ZUP1 (Zinc finger containing Ub Peptidase 1).",

(Elia et al., 2015; Povlsen et al., 2012) . Promisingly, the Ub system has become a prominent target for drug discovery to treat cancers, with DUB inhibitors now progressing into clinical trials (Harrigan et al., 2018; Huang and Dixit, 2016; Pinto-Fernandez and Kessler, 2016) . However, our understanding of Ub signaling regulation by DUBs within a cellular context remains under investigated. Our findings suggest that ZUFSP has a major role at stalled replication forks. The ZUFSP interactome identified several important components of the replisome, as well as known DNA repair factors found at stalled replication forks. Furthermore, loss of ZUFSP in human cancer cells led to increased endogenous DNA damage in these cells, and we could further show that this endogenous DNA damage originates in S-phase. Third, ZUFSP is required for cellular resilience to DNA damage with replication-dependent components. Collectively, we propose that ZUFSP is required for cellular responses to DNA replication stress.",

            "text": "Going forward, defining mechanistically how the biochemical activity of ZUFSP is linked to the replication stress phenotype is of paramount importance to understand. With its exquisite selectivity for cleaving K63-linked polyUb, it is plausible that ZUFSP regulates K63 ubiquitylation following replication stress. Alternatively, ZUFSP may be recruited via its UBZ domain to K6, K48, or K63 chains formed at sites of damage to subsequently cleave K63-chains from substrates. Being key for the activity of ZUFSP, it is tempting to speculate that the UBZ domain mediates substrate recruitment via binding to polyUb and as the S1 0 site enabling cleavage of K63-linked chains. While we have identified a network of ZUFSP-associated proteins implicated in DNA replication and repair, it will be essential to determine which, if any, of these interactors are bona fide substrates of ZUFSP. However, identifying substrates of DUBs is not trivial and in fact cellular substrates for a vast majority of DUBs are unknown (Leznicki and Kulathu, 2017) . Studying how dysregulated Ub signaling of ZUFSP substrates causes replication stress is likely to reveal fresh insights into the role of ubiquitylation in the cellular responses to DNA replication stress. Given that loss of ZUFSP in human cancer cells both causes endogenous DNA replication stress and sensitizes cells to further exogenous DNA damage, it will now be important to understand whether, and how, ZUFSP loss synergizes with defects in other DDR pathways.",

The ZUFSP-MIU catalytic domain construct spanning 231-578 was used for protein expression. For heavy atom labeling, M9 minimal media supplemented with glucose, vitamins and amino acids with the exception of L-methionine was prepared. In the supplemented M9 medium, L-Selenomethionine was added at the final concentration of 30 mg/l. The overnight pre-culture was grown in LB medium at 37 C and harvested at 2500 rpm for 5-8 minutes followed by resuspension in M9 supplemented media. Following inoculation, bacterial cultures were induced 0.7 OD 600 with 300 mM IPTG. Post induction, the temperature was lowered to 18 C and cells were left shaking for another 20 hours before harvest. Protein was purified according to GST-purification step as described. The cleaved protein was eluted in a buffer containing 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT. Further, the protein was mixed with 3 fold excess of propargylated Ub and incubated for overnight on a roller at 4 C. Following cation exchange chromatography to segregate ZUFSP Cat -Ub Prg complex from the unreacted ZUFSP Cat domain, gel filtration chromatography on Superdex G75 was done as the last step in the purification. All the fractions post SDS-PAGE run were pooled and concentrated for crystallization trials.",

Recombinant ZUFSP MIU-cat protein was eluted in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT pH 8 and then mixed in a 1: 3 ratio with propargylated Ub (Ub-Prg) and incubated for 12 h at 4 C. ZUFSP MIU-cat -Ub-Prg complexes were purified and crystallized. Initial ZUFSP-Ub-Prg (native) crystals were obtained using sitting-drop vapor diffusion method against the well solution containing 4% v/v Tacsimate pH 5.0 and 12% w/v Polyethylene glycol 3,350 (14 mg/ml). The crystals were flash frozen in cryoprotectant containing 4% v/v Tacsimate pH 5.0, 30% glycerol and 5% ethylene glycol. The crystals diffracted X-rays to 1.74\u00c5 at I04 beamline, DLS, UK. After unsuccessful attempts of using the Ub as a search model to solve the structure by molecular replacement, the ZUFSP-Ub-Prg was Selenomethionine labeled for anomalous phasing. The crystals were grown in sitting drop 24 well plates against the well solution of 4% v/v Tacsimate pH 5.0 and 12% w/v Polyethylene glycol 3,350 (8.5 mg/ml). The crystals were flash frozen in the cryoprotectant as used above for the native crystals. The MAD datasets for two different wavelengths 0.97264 (peak) and 0.97923 (inflection) were collected from different part of the same crystal at ID29 beamline, ESRF, France. The anomalous data were processed using XDS (Kabsch, 2010) and then scaled using AIMLESS (Evans and Murshudov, 2013) . The structure was solved using the two wavelength MAD phasing mode of Auto-Rickshaw: the EMBL-Hamburg automated crystal structure determination platform (Panjikar et al., 2005) . The partially built model obtained was further submitted to the MRSAD pipeline. The complete model was obtained after iterative building and refinement with COOT (Emsley et al., 2010) and REFAMC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997) (Winn et al., 2011) . The anomalous and native datasets were sufficiently isomorphous to allow refinement of the model against the native dataset. The final structure was re-refined using PDB-REDO (Joosten, R.P. et al., 2014) . The final data collection and refinement statistics for the ZUFSP-Ub-Prg complex structure is shown in Table 1 . All the figures were made using PyMOL (http://pymol.org).",

The MIU motif is partially ordered and does not mediate any interactions with the distal ubiquitin. Ubiquitin binding to MIU was modelled based on the canonical mode of MIU-Ub interaction (PDB ID: 2FIF). Superposition of the RABEX5 MIU-Ub interaction onto the MIU motif of ZUFSP results in ubiquitin binding to the MIU motif in such a way that the C-terminus of the MIU-bound ubiquitin points towards K63 of the ZHA bound distal ubiquitin. This model therefore suggests a K63-linked diubiquitin bound to the long helical arm, i.e. ZHA and MIU. Further, it suggests",
