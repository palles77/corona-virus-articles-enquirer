The disease rapidly spread throughout China and elsewhere, becoming a global health emergency (WHO, 2020) . The mental health of medical and nursing staff has been greatly challenged during the immediate wake of the viral epidemic (Chong et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2009) . In battling the sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), psychological distress among medical staff appeared gradually: fear and anxiety appeared immediately and decreased in the early stages of the epidemic, but depression, psychophysiological symptoms and posttraumatic stress symptoms appeared later and lasted for a long time, leading to profound impacts (Chong et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2009) . Being isolated, working in high-risk positions, and having contact with infected people are common causes of trauma (Wu et al., 2009; Maunder et al., 2003) . These factors may have impacted medical and nursing staff in Wuhan, leading to mental health problems.",

The PHQ-9 is a self-report measure used to assess the severity of depression, with the total scores categorized as follows: minimal/no depression (0-4), mild depression (5-9), moderate depression (10-14), or severe depression (15-21) (Kocalevent et al., 2013) . The GAD-7 is a self-rated scale to evaluate the severity of anxiety and has good reliability and validity. The total scores are categorized as follows: minimal/no anxiety (0-4), mild anxiety (5-9), moderate anxiety (10-14), or severe anxiety (15-21) (L\u00f6we et al., 2008) . The ISI is a measure of insomnia severity that has been shown to be valid and reliable. The total scores are categorized as follows: normal (0-7), subthreshold (8-14), moderate insomnia (15-21), or severe insomnia (22-28) (Morin et al., 2011) . The IES-R is a self-report measure used to assess the response to a specific stressful life event and has extensive reliability and validity. The event used for this questionnaire was the occurrence of 2.2.6.

Descriptive analysis was used to describe the general data and currently accessed psychological services. For count data, frequencies and percentages were used. The k-means clustering method was used to cluster the PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and IES-R scores (Ball, 1967) . With the Euclidean square root distance as the measurement index, the patients were divided into 4 groups by the Ward method. According to this grouping, exposure to COVID-19 and the current state of mental healthcare services were compared. The chi-square test was used to compare the data for different categorical variables. A structural equation model (SEM) was constructed via Mplus to explore the relationship among the four components, namely, exposure, accessed mental healthcare services, mental health status (PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and IES-R scores) and self-perceived health status compared to that before the COVID-19 outbreak. The estimation method used weighted least squares with mean and variance adjustment test statistics (Distefano and Morgan, 2014) . We used a Monte Carlo method with 1000 guided resamplings to construct a confidence interval for the estimation effect (Bauer et al., 2006) . In SEM, several criteria, such as root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) values lower than 0.08 and comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) values greater than 0.90, indicate acceptable models (Hu and Bentler, 1998) .

First, exposure as a risk factor for mental health, including the confirmed diagnosis of patients, the participants' themselves, family, friends, colleagues, neighbors, and coresidents with suspected symptoms, was analyzed in the previous step. Second, the mental healthcare services accessed consisted of psychological materials and psychological resources available through media. Third, mental health consisted of the PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and IES-R scores. The fourth area was the subjective feelings of the staff regarding whether their physical conditions were worse than before the epidemic. Figure 1 and Table 6. 3.6. Psychological care needs of medical and nursing staff In terms of the content of interest, namely, psychological care, medical and nursing staff with subthreshold disturbances most wanted to obtain skills to help alleviate others' psychological distress, whereas other medical and nursing staff most wanted to obtain self-help skills. Medical and nursing staff with higher levels of mental health problems were more interested in skills for self-rescue and showed more urgent desires to seek help from psychotherapists and psychiatrists. Medical and nursing staff differed in terms of how they wanted to obtain services based on their levels of mental health problems. Medical and nursing staff with subthreshold and mild disturbances preferred to obtain such services from media sources, while staff with heavier burdens wanted to seek services directly from professionals. Apart from medical and nursing staff with subthreshold disturbances who did not think they needed help from others, the other workers saw a greater need to obtain help from professionals than from close family and friends. The results are shown in Table 7 .",

These latter methods can nonetheless contribute positively to alleviating mental health problems and physical discomfort caused by risk factors such as the exposure of close contacts to COVID-19. Such exposure is known to be mentally injurious in epidemic settings: when the SARS epidemic hit, not only did the direct exposure of the work environment affect the mental health of medical staff, but the infection of friends or close relatives generated psychological trauma (Wu et al.,",

People with such levels of disturbances may be more likely than those with more severe disturbances to take action and be motivated to learn the necessary skills and to adapt in productive ways to respond to diverse challenges. These skills have been shown in previous retrospective studies to be protective for later mental health (Maunder et al., 2006) . In addition, we note that people with subthreshold and mild mental health disturbances want to find ways to better help others, which is beneficial for health care teams. In terms of physiology, positive coping has been seen to increase immune function when victimized subjects report high mental demands, leading to a better state of response (Sakami et al., 2004) . However, there are negative consequences of stimulation caused by pressure, as acute psychological stress is known to activate the sympathetic adrenal medulla system and hypothalamus-pituitary adrenal axis, and this two-component stress response impacts physical and mental health and has disease consequences (Turner et al., 2020) . In summary, continuous mental healthcare services are necessary even for subthreshold and mild psychological reactions during this epidemic to attenuate the possibility of escalating complications.",

Thus, the Lancet Global Mental Health Commission's observation that the use of nonprofessionals and digital technologies can provide a range of mental health interventions may indicate an opportunity(Patel et al., 2018). Our data are consistent with a model in which psychological advice and guidance in print resources and disseminated in the media can provide a level of protection for medical and nursing staff, improving mental health by reducing the stress impacts caused by high risk of infection. Clearly, there is a role, nonetheless, for therapist-driven sessions, as previous research showed that a convenient group course intervention for doctors reduced depersonalization, improved views on the meaning of work, and achieved sustained results(West et al., 2014). We anticipate similar benefit for COVID-19 staff in Wuhan based on our findings contained herein.Interestingly, previous studies on medical staff and other infectious agents have repeatedly emphasized that mental health impacts are related to department and occupation(Hawryluck et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2009). Health care workers with professional knowledge about differences in the relative exposure patterns and transmission of different infectious diseases could gain some degree of comfort and control over their situations(Chowell et al., 2015). For example, over the decades, although hepatitis viruses and HIV have often caused lethal infections, radiologists, pathologists and nurses knew that their risk of exposure was low as long as they exercised caution in their contact with bodily fluids. The situation has been different in Wuhan due to the pernicious characteristics of COVID-19. Many infected individuals exhibit minimal or no symptoms while contagious, for example, early in the course of infection(Bai et al., 2020). These individuals may thus visit a variety of different hospital departments in an infectious but asymptomatic state, unknowingly spreading the disease directly through aerosolized droplets or indirectly through skin contact with handled surfaces. These features of the infectivity of coronavirus involve a substantial risk of exposure for medical workers, regardless of their hospital department, job title or building location; thus, any worker -whether doctor or nurse, specialist or generalist -is at substantial risk. The resultant stress due to concerns about infection risk thus indiscriminately affects large numbers of personnel.",

Have your neighbors (people living in the same community who may or may not know each other) been diagnosed? Then, participants were asked whether there was anyone living with them with suspected symptoms. The answer to each question was yes or no.The following question was used to determine which psychological services the subject had accessed. Have you ever received the following services: psychological materials (leaflets, brochures and books provided by mental health workers and distributed to staff in the hospital), psychological resources available through media (psychological assistance methods and techniques provided by psychologists through online media or TV news or various online platforms) (Supplementary material), and counseling or psychotherapy (including individual or group therapy)?2.2.5.
