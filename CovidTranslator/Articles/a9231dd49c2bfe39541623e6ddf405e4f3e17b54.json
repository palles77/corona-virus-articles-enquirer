There had been mild diarrhoea for 3 days, starting simultaneously with the head tilt but resolving prior to referral. Clinical (including ophthalmic) examination revealed a right-sided head tilt, otherwise the cat was normal. Neurolocalisation indicated a peripheral vestibular lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging, brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) test and cerebrospinal fluid analyses (including coronavirus serology) were normal. Routine biochemistry and haematology were within normal limits. Serology for toxoplasma (IgG ELISA) was positive with a high titre (1:2048) and for feline coronavirus (1:1280). A provisional diagnosis of idiopathic vestibular disease was made, but to rule out otitis media/interna the cat was treated with enrofloxacin (Baytril; Bayer, 25 mg twice daily (bid) per os (PO)) for 6 weeks. The head tilt did not diminish and the owner reported the cat to be lethargic and that it licked its lips excessively. The antibiotic was changed to clindamycin (Antirobe; Pharmacia Animal Health, 15 mg/kg bid PO). There was no improvement in the head tilt or the cat's demeanour and the owner stopped the clindamycin after 8 days.",

Clinical examination by the referring vet revealed pyrexia and an irregular cranial abdominal mass, the cat was otherwise unremarkable. The head tilt was not evident and the owner was unable to state when it had resolved. A routine biochemical profile was normal. Radiography of the thorax was unremarkable, but abdominal radiography and ultrasound showed what appeared to be a large gastric mass. Exploratory laparotomy, performed on the same day, revealed poorly circumscribed thickening of the stomach and duodenum and enlargement of the drainage lymph nodes. Surgical biopsies of the stomach and lymph node were taken. Histological examination of the gastric biopsies showed marked fibrosis of the gastric wall accompanied by a mixed inflammatory infiltration including frequent eosinophils. The lymph node biopsy revealed hyperplasia and an eosinophilic lymphadenitis with marked thickening of the capsule, also associated with a predominately eosinophilic infiltrate. Based on the biopsy results a diagnosis of eosinophilic gastritis was made. The cat was treated with fenbendazole (Panacur; Intervet, 1.8 g once daily PO) for 3 days and prednisolone (Prednicare; Animalcare, 5 mg bid PO). The cat showed some improvement and stopped vomiting but remained lethargic. Repeat physical examination 11 days post-biopsy showed the gastric lesion to be enlarging.",

The stomach appeared rigid and amotile. The majority of the mucosa and submucosa had a normal layered appearance and subjectively appeared normal in thickness but there was massive, diffuse thickening throughout the muscularis layer. The muscularis was increased in echogenicity with a 'streaky' appearance resulting in reduced contrast with the submucosa. The serosal layer could not be clearly defined as a distinct layer but the external surface of the stomach was slightly irregular. In one area, there was a focal crater within the mucosal surface with a hyperechoic interface Transverse (a) and oblique (b) ultrasound images of the stomach. There is massive thickening and increased echogenicity of the muscularis layer (large arrowheads) resulting in loss of visualisation of the submucosal and serosal layers.

The cells were a mixture of small lymphocytes, macrophages and eosinophils in roughly equal proportions with 7% neutrophils. Feline coronovirus serology of the fluid was negative. Protozoal tachyzoites were seen within the cytoplasm of a macrophage on one of the fine needle aspirate smears. The biopsy of the gastric wall showed disruption of the muscularis by bands of fibrovascular tissue infiltrated with large numbers of eosinophils and smaller numbers of lymphocytes, plasma cells and histiocytes. Examination with pinacyanol stain showed diffusely scattered welldifferentiated mast cells consistent with an inflammatory infiltrate; there was no evidence of mast cell neoplasia. ZiehleNeelsen staining for acid-fast bacteria was negative and special culture of fresh tissue obtained from the biopsy showed no growth of mycobacteria. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining did not reveal any evidence of fungal infection. Tissue cysts containing protozoal bodies were seen in one area of the biopsy. Immunostaining of the gastric biopsy showed the presence of multiple free organisms diffusely throughout the lesion (Fig 3a) and confirmed the organisms to be Toxoplasma gondii. Subsequent immunostaining of the original gastric and lymph node biopsies revealed several cysts containing T gondii bradyzoites within the lymph node and free organisms, not apparent on haematoxylin and eosin stained sections, within inflammatory lesions in the gastric biopsy (Fig 3b) . Immunostaining proved negative for Neospora caninum organisms. Based on these results a diagnosis of eosinophilic fibrosing gastritis and toxoplasmosis was made. Blood tests for feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) (by polymerase chain reaction) and serology for feline coronavirus were negative. Additional serological tests for T gondii were not performed.",

Intravenous fluid therapy was given. Antibiotic therapy was changed to clindamycin (Antirobe; Pharmacia Animal Health, 50 mg bid PO) on receipt of the biopsy results 5 days later. Despite treatment, the cat remained persistently pyrexic (up to 40.3 C), although was clinically bright and eating normally. Eight days after referral the cat deteriorated acutely with tachypnoea and pale mucous membranes. Thoracic radiographs showed a mild generalised mixed broncho-interstitial lung pattern. In the periphery of the lungfields there were a few small, sparse ill-defined amorphous patches of an alveolar lung pattern. Abdominal radiographs demonstrated reduced serosal detail with wispy soft tissue/fluid superimposed over the falciform fat. The pylorus was enlarged with gross, irregular thickening of the gastric wall (Fig 4) . The transverse colon and small intestines were displaced caudally by the enlarged stomach. The serosal surface of the stomach could not be clearly seen due to a small volume of abdominal fluid. The haematocrit was reduced (0.10 l/l reference range 0.24e0.45 l/l) and as the cat was deteriorating, 50 ml of matched type A blood was transfused. There was no improvement in the cat's tachypnoea despite supplemental oxygen and he remained depressed.

The mode of transmission is through ingestion of infected tissues, ingestion of oocystcontaminated food or water, or by congenital infection. Most cats are thought to become infected by ingesting intermediate hosts infected with tissue cysts (Dubey and Carpenter 1993, Dubey and Lappin 1998) . In cats, Toxoplasma gondii undergoes an enteroepithelial cycle. Bradyzoites are released into the stomach and intestine from the tissue cysts when the cyst wall is dissolved by digestive enzymes. Bradyzoites penetrate the epithelial cells of the small intestine and initiate five asexual stages before oocysts are passed in faeces. An extraintestinal life cycle also occurs in all hosts. Bradyzoites (in tissue cysts) or sporozoites (in oocysts) excyst in the lumen of the small intestine and penetrate intestinal cells, including the cells of the lamina propria. The organism divides and transforms into tachyzoites, which can multiply in almost any cell in the body.",

When disease develops, clinical signs are variable and nonspecific; but pyrexia, anorexia, lethargy and dyspnoea have been reported in generalised toxoplasmosis (Dubey and Lappin 1998) . Gastrointestinal signs have been reported in up to 35% of cases of generalised disease (Petrak and Carpenter 1965) , and involvement of the gastrointestinal tract (predominately intestinal) has been reported in up to 41.5% of clinical cases examined histologically (Dubey and Carpenter 1993) . However, such information has been mainly derived from post-mortem examination of fatal cases of generalised feline toxoplasmosis, and there is evidence that ocular disease (uveitis and chorioretinitis) may be a more common and non-fatal manifestation of feline toxoplasmosis (Lappin et al 1989 , Lappin 2000a .",

Despite investigations, an underlying or predisposing cause could not be conclusively identified in this cat. Immunosuppressive drugs can result in recrudescence and generalised toxoplasmosis (Bernsteen et al 1999) , but experimentally, the use of high doses of prednisolone in cats with evidence of exposure did not result in development of generalised toxoplasmosis (Dubey and Frenkel 1974) . The initial serology results 6 months earlier had showed exposure to T gondii and recrudescence is possible. In this case, steroid administration was not thought to be a contributing factor as there was evidence of active infection in the biopsies taken prior to treatment with steroids. Inflammatory doses of prednisolone are used widely without resulting in recrudescence of toxoplasmosis, and are recommended in cases of ocular toxoplasmosis. In the largest reported series of naturally occurring cases, the use of corticosteroids was not thought to be a predisposing factor (Dubey and Carpenter 1993) .",

Gastric involvement in naturally occurring generalised toxoplasmosis is rarely reported (Petrak and Carpenter 1965, Peterson et al 1991) . In one experimental study, where cats were infected with T gondii and then killed, no gastric involvement was reported (Dubey and Frenkel 1972) . In another study, in which infected cats were given high doses of corticosteroids, gastric involvement was found in six of 24 kittens, with the organism preferentially affecting the muscularis (Dubey and Frenkel 1974) . Acute toxoplasmosis typically results in necrosis within the intestinal wall (Dubey 1986 , Peterson et al 1991 . There are, however, few detailed reports describing the gastrointestinal changes seen in naturally occurring chronic toxoplasmosis (Meier et al 1957, Hirth and Nielsen 1969) . There are occasional reports of intestinal granulomas, and chronic and proliferative lesions secondary to toxoplasmosis (Hulland 1956 , Meier et al 1957 , Hirth and Nielsen 1969 , Feeney et al 1981 . Unfortunately, detailed histopathological descriptions are often lacking (Meier et al 1957, Hirth and Nielsen 1969) . Further studies are required to determine if naturally occurring toxoplasmosis can result in chronic gastrointestinal granulomatous disease. This case differs from previously published reports in that a marked eosinophilic component and chronic inflammatory response was seen. It is possible that the chronic inflammatory response seen in this case reflects a prolonged infection with T gondii, with incomplete treatment early in the course of the disease.",
