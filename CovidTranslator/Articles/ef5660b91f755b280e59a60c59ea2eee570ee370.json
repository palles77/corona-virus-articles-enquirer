Response plans for these events may include use of medications and vaccines for which the effects on pregnant women and fetuses are unknown. Healthcare providers must be able to discuss the benefits and risks of these interventions with their pregnant patients. Recent experiences with outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome, monkeypox, and anthrax, as well as response planning for bioterrorism and pandemic influenza, illustrate the challenges of making recommendations about treatment and prophylaxis for pregnant women. Understanding the physiology of pregnancy, the factors that influence the teratogenic potential of medications and vaccines, and the infection control measures that may stop an outbreak will aid planners in making recommendations for care of pregnant women during large-scale infectious disease emergencies.",

For example, when a pregnant woman has a serious acute infection, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), anthrax, or a pandemic strain of influenza, appropriate timely treatment must be provided to preserve her health. When multiple therapeutic interventions of similar efficacy are available, consideration can be given to choosing the therapy that will best safeguard maternal health and the well-being of the embryo or fetus. In contrast, when a pregnant woman has been exposed to a serious infection but is not acutely ill, the choice of whether to provide prophylaxis or empirical treatment depends on several factors including the nature and certainty of the exposure, likelihood and potential severity of her infection, and gestational age at which exposure occurred. Inadvertent exposure to a medication or vaccine also may occur during pregnancy. An estimated half of pregnancies in the United States are unplanned (2); thus, a woman infected with or exposed to a serious acute infection might receive emergency prophylactic or treatment measures during the early weeks of gestation before a pregnancy is recognized. In this situation, opportunity to weigh the risks and benefits to a pregnancy before exposure to the medication or vaccine is missed; instead, consideration must focus on any effects these measures may have had on the fetus. some drugs. A drug's pharmacokinetics (i.e., attainment and maintenance of the appropriate drug serum concentration) are affected by 4 major factors: absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (3) . Because physiologic changes are evolving continuously during pregnancy, pharmacokinetic information must be interpreted with regard to gestational age (4) .",

Potential adverse effects of an exposure on the embryo or fetus include spontaneous pregnancy loss, structural malformations, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, hearing loss, and neurobehavioral abnormalities, among others. Timing of exposure during gestation is particularly critical. Organogenesis, the period of organ formation, extends from 15 to 60 days after fertilization (\u22484-11 weeks after the start of the last menstrual period) (10) . Before organogenesis, harmful exposures are most likely to result in spontaneous pregnancy loss, although some embryos that survive can be adversely affected (11) . After this time, structural abnormalities are less likely to occur, although damage to a normally formed organ is still possible (12) . In addition, some teratogenic medications have a narrow window of exposure when their use results in malformations. For example, thalidomide is believed to produce malformations only when used 34-50 days after the beginning of the last menstrual period (13) . In contrast, adverse outcomes such as growth retardation and functional abnormalities can result from later exposures. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been associated with impaired renal function in the newborn when used to treat maternal hypertension during the latter half of pregnancy (13) .",

Reports suggest that the clinical course and outcomes of SARS might be more severe for pregnant than for nonpregnant women (23) . Identifying appropriate treatment modalities during the SARS outbreak was challenging, given the lack of information about the newly identified disease. Ribavirin was initially chosen because of its broad antiviral spectrum. Corticosteroids were used in an attempt to limit the tissue damage caused by the inflammatory response (24) . However, issues regarding the teratogenicity of these medications have been raised, further complicating decisions about their use during pregnancy. Some animal studies have suggested that ribavirin is teratogenic, but limited experience is available regarding its effects on human pregnancies (25) . Animal studies and some human studies have demonstrated an increased risk for birth defects when corticosteroids are used during pregnancy (26) . In spite of this information, all but 1 of the 12 pregnant women with SARS reported from Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China received ribavirin and corticosteroid treatment (22) , probably because their illness was life-threatening. On the basis of more recent data, the efficacy of ribavirin and corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with SARS has been questioned (24) . Other medications, such as interferons, have been proposed for use in future SARS outbreaks, but use of these medications in pregnant women may also be of concern.",

The recommended medication for initial antimicrobial drug prophylaxis of asymptomatic exposed adults was ciprofloxacin, with doxycycline and amoxicillin as alternative therapies if the strain was susceptible (37) . Because of an observed association between fluoroquinolones and joint and cartilage toxicity in juvenile animals (38) , ciprofloxacin is generally not recommended during pregnancy if efficacious alternatives are available. Although information on the safety of ciprofloxacin in pregnant women was lacking, the available limited information suggested that its use during pregnancy was unlikely to be associated with a high risk for structural birth defects. In addition, maternal exposure to tetracyclines, which include doxycyline, carries the known risks of staining the primary teeth, concern about bone growth and abnormal tooth enamel in the fetus (39) , and rare instances of hepatic necrosis in pregnant women. Although penicillins are considered safe during pregnancy, the fact that Bacillus anthracis strains may have penicillinase activity led to the recommendation that amoxicillin be used for prophylaxis only if the specific strain was shown to be penicillin sensitive. On the basis of these considerations, CDC recommended that ciprofloxacin be the antimicrobial drug of choice for initial prophylactic therapy of asymptomatic pregnant women exposed to B. anthracis during the 2001 anthrax attacks (40) . The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Obstetric Practice endorsed these recommendations and emphasized that prophylaxis be limited to women exposed to a confirmed environmental contamination or a high-risk source, as determined by local public health officials (41) .",

Preliminary results from the registry suggest that the rates of pregnancy loss, preterm birth, and birth defects among infants born to vaccinated women did not increase, but evaluation is ongoing. Pregnancy registries such as this and the Department of Defense Birth and Infant Health Registry (43) should be considered whenever emergency response activities invoke the use of medications or vaccines with unknown effects on pregnant women and fetuses.",

Data on the effects of some emergency response countermeasure treatments on pregnant women and fetuses are limited. Emergency response planners should include recommendations for pregnant women in pre-event response plans, rather than creating them during an emergency. Clinicians should become familiar with pregnancy-related recommendations for prophylaxis and treatment of persons with emerging and bioterrorism pathogens so that they are prepared to discuss risks and benefits of recommended treatments with their pregnant patients. In an emergency response setting, pregnant women should be encouraged to consider their own health and safety and the effect of potential ill health on their pregnancy, should be offered prenatal evaluation for fetal abnormalities if desired, and should be encouraged to enroll in pregnancy registries when applicable. Long-term goals should include evaluation of the effects of emergency response treatments for the pregnant woman and fetus, and research and development of safer and effective medications when warranted.
