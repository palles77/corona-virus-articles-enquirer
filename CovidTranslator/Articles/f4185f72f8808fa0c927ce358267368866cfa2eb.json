Objectives: To characterize complete SARS-CoV S-gene sequences from Hong Kong. Study design: Fifty-six SARS-CoV S-gene sequences, obtained from patients who presented with SARS to the Prince of Wales Hospital during March-May 2003, were analysed using a maximum likelihood (ML) approach, together with 138 other (both human and animal) S-gene sequences downloaded from GenBank. Results: The maximum-likelihood (ML) trees showed little evolution occurring within these 56 sequences. Analysis with the other sequences, showed three distinct SARS clusters, closely correlated to previously defined early, middle and late phases of the 2003 international SARS outbreaks. In addition, two new single nucleotide variations (SNVs), T21615A and T21901A, were discovered, not previously reported elsewhere.",

            "text": "Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003 around the world, many researchers have attempted to determine the natural reservoir of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Studies on the possible animal source of SARS-CoV have mainly focused on the Himalyan palm civet (Paguma larvata), though other animals (e.g. the raccoon dog, Nyctereutes procyonoides) have been shown to carry coronaviruses closely related to the SARS-CoV. Of note, these related animal coronaviruses possess a 29 base-pair sequence (position 27,869-27,897) in the 1386-6532/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10. 1016/j.jcv.2006.10.001 putative open reading frame (ORF) 11 (Marra et al., 2003) , that is absent in most human SARS-CoV isolates (Guan et al., 2003; Song et al., 2005) . A more recent study on SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses from palm civets and raccoon dogs from various live markets in China identified a series of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein gene (Kan et al., 2005) . The authors suggested that these SNVs marked the transmission of SARS-CoV-like viruses from these animals into humans during various phases of the SARS epidemic. Most recently, SARS-like CoV have been found in bats though the S-gene homology with SARS-CoV is low, around 80%, and it is still uncertain as to whether this is the true natural reservoir for SARS-CoV (Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005; Poon et al., 2005a,b) . Guan et al. (2004) described the genetic variation of the first 2149 bp of the S-gene, mainly focusing on the S1 (amino) region. This study compared local SARS-CoV S1 gene sequences collected from 137 Hong Kong SARS patients from February to April 2003, with 27 other sequences then available from GenBank, using neighbour-joining (NJ) phylogenetic analysis. The authors concluded that the international SARS epidemics were caused by closely related SARS-CoVs. However, some strains isolated from Hong Kong in the early phase of epidemic, were distinct from the international outbreak strain, and may have represented transitory strains of SARS-CoV (Chim et al., 2004) . Furthermore, analysis of SARS-CoV strains subsequently isolated from China suggested that this virus may have been circulating there, unidentified, for some time before the international epidemic occurred (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, CSMEC, 2004; Zhao et al., 2004) .",

In this study, we did not find any of these previously reported mutations, however, there were mutations found mainly in the TC samples (T21615A and T21901A) that have not been previously reported elsewhere. These are most likely to be tissue-culture associated mutations. It is interesting that the T21615A mutation results in a stop codon, yet still manages to produce a viable virus in tissue culture.",

(2005) . The 17 CUHK S-gene sequences containing this polymorphism all occur in samples collected towards the end of the SARS outbreaks in Hong Kong (from 4 April to 31 May 2003). Unfortunately, we do not know on what date the GUAN LC2/LC3/LC4/LC5 samples were taken (they are unpublished sequences that were submitted to GenBank on 19 September 2003), and it is therefore difficult to ascertain whether this SNV represents ongoing host-adaptive evolution. All of these 56 CUHK samples came from patients admitted to Hong Kong's New Territories East hospital cluster during this period. The 17/56 patients carrying this C25114T mutation may have acquired their virus via a chain of contacts infected with this particular virus, or this mutation occurred in all of these viruses independently, perhaps in response to some common, unknown selection pressure. Therefore, without a more accurate epidemic history for this particular virus, it is hard to say whether this is a founder effect or natural selection acting upon the virus towards the end of the Hong Kong 2003 SARS outbreaks.",
