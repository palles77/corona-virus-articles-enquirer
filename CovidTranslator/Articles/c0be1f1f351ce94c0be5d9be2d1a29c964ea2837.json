            "text": "The quantity and quality of research in the field of sleep has increased rapidly, with a 4-fold rise in the number of publications during the period from 1974 to 2007. 1 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleeprelated breathing disorder characterized by repetitive upper airway obstruction, which causes frequent episodes of reduced (hypopnic) or no (apneic) airflow during sleep. 2 OSA is common in the adult population, with a prevalence of approximately 5%, 3 and it may negatively affect multiple organs, resulting in the development of cardiovascular diseases and neurocognitive problems. 4 OSA can be treated using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which has been shown to result in improved quality of life. 5 Bibliometric analysis is a research method used in library and information science to evaluate research performance. 6, 7 This method uses quantitative and statistical analyses to describe patterns of publication on a given topic, in a given field, institute, or country. The increasing use of bibliometric analysis by institutes 8 and journals 9 indicates its importance. Close examination of the literature provides information to researchers, 10 and publication output in a certain discipline or topic can represent its previous, current, and future research trends or focus. 11 One common method for carrying out bibliometric research is to use the Science Citation Index (SCI) or Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), which are published by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), Philadelphia, PA, USA, to trace citations. Numerous medical topics such as sleep research, 1 severe acute respiratory syndrome, 12 respiratory medicine, 13 patent ductus arteriosus, 14 and asthma research 15 have been analyzed using the SCI and SSCI to assess the performance in each research topic and indicate the authors' impacts on and contributions to their respective fields. However, despite the importance of OSA, there have been no published bibliometric analyses of the research on this disorder. In this investigation, we attempted to gain insights into the quantity and quality of research in the area of OSA by analyzing the SCI database. The results of this study will be of value to researchers in various fields, including clinical neurology, who seek information about the current trends and future directions in sleep-related research.",

Author-generated key words, such as \"obstructive sleep apnea\", \"obstructive apnea\", and \"OSA\", and KeyWords Plus \u00ae were analyzed. KeyWords Plus \u00ae in the SCI database supplies additional search terms extracted from the titles of articles cited by authors in their bibliographies and footnotes. 16 Data collected from the online searches were extracted and manipulated in Excel spreadsheets to provide the input for the analysis, and the search results were checked to verify that all entries were related to OSA. Documents were analyzed according to trends of publication output, subject category, journal pattern, country of publication, authorship, author-generated key words, and KeyWords Plus \u00ae . The trend of annual publication output was determined from 1991, the first year in which abstracts were available in ISI, to 2006, the last year for which complete information was available at the time of the search; and the analysis was performed for 4-year periods within this 16-year time span. Articles originating from England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales were grouped under the United Kingdom (UK) heading. The impact factor of a journal was determined for each document as reported in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) 2005. We determined the type of collaboration for each article by the address of each author, where \"independent\" was assigned if no collaboration was found and \"international collaboration\" was assigned if a paper was co-written by researchers from more than 1 country.",

In contrast, fewer papers on OSA are being published in categories of more general interest, such as general and internal medicine, and sports sciences.

For example, a decrease in the number of publications was noted in subject areas such as general and internal medicine, psychiatry, and sports sciences. Furthermore, among the 7 core journals that published the most OSA-related research, the highest ranking (Sleep) focuses exclusively on sleep research.

            "text": "Our study found a large number of key words that were used only once. This, combined with the variety of subject categories noted, may indicate a lack of continuity in research and a wide disparity in research focuses corresponding to the increasing significance of OSA in multiple disciplines. 20 A unique aspect of this study was the use of the KeyWords Plus \u00ae feature to identify research trends. 21 Previous bibliometric studies have used only authorgenerated key words, but we have analyzed with the use of KeyWords Plus \u00ae simultaneously. In general, the source title and author-generated key words supply reasonable details about an article's subject. 22 KeyWords Plus \u00ae , however, can reveal greater detail about an article's content. 23 Thus, by combining the terms from KeyWords Plus \u00ae , it is possible to glimpse more details about the subject of each individual article and to identify emerging themes within the field. The term metabolic syndrome illustrates this. Our data showed that the area of metabolic syndrome ranked 132 in the overall period of study, but that its rank rose to 54 in the most recent period of 2003 to 2006. This suggests that recognition of the association between OSA and metabolic syndrome has emerged since 2003. 24 Therefore, articles that may not have identified OSA as a key word but may be part of a developing research trend will be captured in a bibliometric analysis using KeyWords Plus \u00ae .",

The most commonly used key words after \"OSA\" and \"sleep apnea\" were \"snoring\" and \"polysomnography\". From this observation, we might infer that current OSA research is focused on clinical symptoms, such as snoring, and frequently used methods of diagnosis, such as polysomnography. On the other hand, there is less emphasis on basic laboratory research about OSA at present. These terms may suggest areas where additional research is needed in the future. C.P. Huang ",
