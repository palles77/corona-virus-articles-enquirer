The purpose of this study was to verify the effects of strain due to individual risk factors and social risk factors on suicidality, and the mediating effect of depressive symptoms in relationship between strain related to individual risk factors and social risk factors and suicidality. The data from sociopsychological anxiety survey of Korea society conducted by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs in 2015 were used in verifying the model. We analyzed the data of 7000 adults aged 19 to 79 years using Structural Equation Modeling. Strain due to individual risk factors was positively related to depressive symptoms and suicidality. Interestingly, strain induced by social risk factors was positively associated with depressive symptoms and suicidality. Social support is significantly associated with depressive symptoms and suicidality. Depressive symptoms directly affected suicidality. In addition, strain due to individual risk factors and social risk factors indirectly affected suicidality mediating depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that not only individual efforts such as social interaction and depression prevention but also government efforts such as preparation for aging may be needed to decrease suicide rate.",

[13] The social risk theory of Taylor-Gooby [15] emphasized the importance of social risk factors in understanding suicide. They divide social risk factors into old social risk factors and new social risk factors. The former assumes that loss of labor related to illness, unemployment, industrial disaster, and poverty in industrial society are the main factors in relation to suicide, whereas the latter focuses on social phenomena after the postindustrial society. In other words, social factors such as changes in family structure, increase in the number of related to female workers, self-employed, temporary position workers, reduction in governmental welfare policy, and population aging are important variables affecting suicide.",

SEM is a strong method of multivariate regression to examine the relationship between variables considering the measurement errors. [33] Dependent variable was suicidality (latent variable), including suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, and predictors include strain due to individual risk factors (observed indicator), strain due to social risk factors with single indicator (observed indicator), social support with two observed indicators (emotional support, social interaction support), and depression with four observed indicators (depressed mood, physical symptoms, happy emotion, interpersonal problem). The normality test showed that SKEW is below 3. Therefore, we used the maximum likelihood estimation. We used the Chi-square GFI, TLI, CFI, RMSEA to verify the fit of the model. Chi-square is likely to accept the null hypothesis because it is very sensitive to sample size. [34] Thus, researchers should consider other indices such as GFI, TLI, CFI, and RMSEA together. GIF, TLI, and CFI are recognized as good if they are higher than 0.95. [35] RMSEA less than 0.08 is acceptable, and 0.05 is considered good.

[5] Strain may induce negative emotions such as hopelessness, anger, and frustration, and heightened tensions, which may lead to mental problems such as depression and suicide. More importantly, strain does not refer to a single stressor or pressure, but distress is composed of at least 2 stressors. [3] In other words, the theory emphasizes that experiencing more than 2 different stressors at the same time significantly increases intent of suicide. Sung-Man Medicine (2018) 97: 27 Medicine It is necessary to grasp key individual factors related to depression and suicide. Therefore, we conducted a hierarchical regression analysis to identify the independent effects of each individual risk factor on suicidality. Results showed that physical/emotional problem due to aging and family dissolution had a great effect on suicidality. In addition, in the sociopsychological anxiety survey of Korea society of KIHASA, [28] participants reported preparation for old age (35.3%) as the most important factor that government should provide to reduce strain induced by individual risk factors. The second important factor was improvement and support of medical system for physical health (19.8%). These results may be related to the phenomenon that the speed of aging in Korean society is the fastest in the world. It is suggested that strain due to preparation for aging and health problems may be key predictors of depression and suicide in Korea society. [38, 39] It is interesting to note that strain related to social risk factors had a great effect on depressive symptoms and suicidality. Evidences suggest that social risk factors may affect individual's mental health. [40] A few studies have identified the effects of the national economic crisis on depressive symptoms and suicide rate, [20] but no studies have examined the effects of social risk factors on depression and suicide considering various social risk factors. These findings suggest that researchers and clinicians should consider social risk factors as direct factors rather than secondary factors in understanding suicide in adults. In particular, Korean society is in a special external situation including tensions between North and South Korea, as well as low fertility, and very rapid aging. These situations may increase people's psychological distress, and consequently in mental health.",

In addition, in the sociopsychological anxiety survey of Korean society of KIHASA, [28] participants answered that economic stimulation and growth promotion (43.0%) is the most important factor when asked \"what do you think the government should do to decrease the strain induced by social risk factors?\". The next was strengthening management of new infectious diseases (19.6%). These results mean that economic recession may affect the mental health such as depression and suicide in the Korean society like other societies. [41, 42] More importantly, low fertility and population aging, one of the representative social issues in Korean society, may have a strong impact on one's mental health from a longterm perspective. The members of the Korean society seem less satisfied with the government reaction when new infectious diseases or national disasters occur. This result may reflect the MERSC (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) incident in 2015.",

Social support was negatively related to depressive symptoms and suicidality. It is plausible that emotional bond and emotional support through interaction with family members and friends may alleviate negative emotions such as loneliness, and consequently in prevention of depression and suicide. Furthermore, these results reinforce the claim that suicide attempts are associated with limited social networks and social interactions. [43, 44] Social support was negatively associated with strain related to individual risk factors, but contrary to expectations, social support positively affected strain associated with social risk factors. These results suggest that information shared through interactions with others can help to find solutions for individual problems, which might reduce strain induced by individual risk factors. On the contrary, as social interaction through the offline and online networks increases, more specific information about the social risk factors is shared, which could induce strain due to social risk factors temporarily. [45] However, these results may be because this study used cross-sectional design. Therefore, further work should extend this study utilizing longitudinal design.",

In addition, strain due to individual risk factors and social risk factors affected suicidality mediating depressive symptoms. These results further strengthen that depression is proximal predictor of suicide, and a mediator in suicide. [9, 25] More importantly, this study expanded the previous model that shows individual risk factors had direct effects on suicide, and indirect effect on suicide via depression including social risk factors. [46] Among sociodemographic variables, gender is an important variable related to depression and suicide. In this study, women reported more depressive symptoms than men, and these results are in line with higher prevalence of depression in women. [47] On the contrary, men may be more vulnerable to suicide than women. Although numerous studies have shown that women are more likely to experience suicidal ideation, the rate of attempted suicide is known to be higher in males. [48] Finally, substance abuse may be an important risk factor for suicidality. A recent study of meta-analysis [49] showed that people with alcohol use disorder and other substance use disorders are likely to attempt suicide compared with control groups. Thus, in future studies, researchers need to test the independent influence of substance abuse on suicidality.",

It is important to consider individual risk factors and social risk factors together in establishing suicide prevention policies. In other words, in order to decrease suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, not only the individual efforts but also government efforts such as providing extensive health insurance are needed to reduce strain associated with social risk factors.",
