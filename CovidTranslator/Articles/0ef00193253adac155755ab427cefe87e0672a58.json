            "text": "Betanodavirus greasy grouper (Epinephelus tauvina) nervous necrosis viruses (GGNNV) protein \u2423, a virus capsid protein, was detected in both nucleolus and cytoplasm of infected cells of Asian sea bass (SB) and transfected cells of SB and Cos-7 with pcDNA3.1/RNA2. To study its subcellular localization, ORF of protein \u2423 with 338 aa was fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene and was detected in transfected cells in the absence of other viral proteins. In both SB and Cos-7 cells, protein \u2423 was found to localize EGFP to the nucleolus and cytoplasm. Deletion mutants of protein \u2423 indicated that N-terminal 43 amino acid residues were required to import EGFP-\u2423 protein into the nucleolus. Further deletions within the 43 amino acid backbone, EGFP/33aa(1-33) and EGFP/30aa(14 -43), localized to the nucleolus, suggesting that the 20 amino acids from 14 to 33 of protein \u2423 were the domain of nucleolus localization. To further determine the nucleolus targeting sequence, deletion mutations within the 20 amino acids of protein \u2423 were constructed. It was found that the deletion of 23 RRR 25 , 29 RRR 31 , or 23 RRRANNRRR 31 prevented the accumulation of EGFP fusion proteins into the nucleolus, demonstrating that 23 RRRANNRRR 31 contain the signal required for nucleolar localization. A similar distribution pattern of localization of protein \u2423 and its deletion mutants in SB and Cos-7 cells suggested that N-terminal residues of protein \u2423 23 RRRANNRRR 31 constitute a nucleolus localization signal that functions in both fish and mammalian cells.",

            "text": "Nodaviruses are small, nonenveloped, spherical viruses with bipartite positive-sense RNA genomes, which are capped but not polyadenylated. Two genera have been distinguished in the Nodaviridae family: alphanodaviruses, which are originally isolated from insects and betanodaviruses, which usually infect a wide variety of larval and juvenile marine fish (Ball et al., 1994 (Ball et al., , 2000 . Similar to alphanodaviruses, the genome of betanodaviruses has two coencapsidated genomic RNA segments (RNAs 1 and 2), both of which are required for infectivity. RNA1 encodes protein A, which is the viral component of the viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). RNA2 encodes protein \u2423, a proteolytic precursor of viral capsid proteins. A subgenomic RNA3 is synthesized during RNA replication from 3\u0408 terminus of RNA1 and encodes one or two small proteins (B1 and B2) with unknown functions. As a member of betanodaviruses, the complete sequence of greasy grouper (Epinephelus tauvina) nervous necrosis viruses (GGNNV) of Singapore strain has been determined in our laboratory. The complete nucleotide sequence of RNA1 is 3103 nucleotides containing an ORF of 982 aa and the RNA2 is 1433 nucleotides containing an ORF of 338 aa . RNA2 encodes a 37-kDa capsid protein whose recombinant protein \u2423 could be used as a sensitive reagent to diagnosis GGNNV infection . In our previous work, GGNNV was demonstrated to be capable of inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis in GGNNV-infected SB cells and protein \u2423 was a possible apoptotic inducer in transfected cells (data not shown).",

Proteins from porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Rowland et al., 1999) , Semliki Forest virus (Favre et al., 1994) , coronavirus , and Borna disease virus (Pyper et al., 1998) have been reported to localize in the nucleolus and to get involved with various aspects of virus replication.

These recombinant plasmids were transfected to Cos-7 cells and viewed by confocal microscopy at 36 h posttransfection. EGFP/RNA2/N90 (data not shown), EGFP/RNA2/N78 (data not shown), and EGFP/RNA2/N43 (Fig. 3B , image a) showed the same distribution in Cos-7 cells; that is, at 36 h posttransfection, most protein was distributed in the cytoplasm and only background signal was observed in the nucleoplasm, but was completely excluded from nucleoli. However, the expression image of EGFP/RNA2/C39 (Fig.  3B , image g) was the same as that of wild-type EGFP-\u2423 fusion protein. The indirect IFA with antiprotein \u2423 sera further demonstrated the localization of EGFP/RNA2/N43 and EGFP/RNA2/C39 in transfected Cos-7 cells. The merged image (Fig. 3B , image f) of EGFP/RNA2/N43 fusion protein (Fig. 3B , image d, green) and red image of antiprotein \u2423 sera (Fig. 3B , image e) showed empty nucleoli.

EGFP-43aa fusion protein was not detected in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 5, lane 3) , whereas in the nuclear fraction, the EGFP-43aa fusion protein was in high concentration (Fig. 5 , lane 1). However, EGFP as a control was found in both cytoplasmic (Fig. 5 , lane 4) and nuclear fraction (Fig. 5, lane 2) . There was more EGFP in cytoplasmic extract than in nuclear fraction. Antinucleolin mAb was used as a control to test the fidelity of the subcellular fractionations from nuclear (Fig. 5 , lane 6) and cytoplasm (Fig. 5, lane 5) .

It was found that at 12 h posttransfection, for all these constructs, most signal was diffused in nucleoplasm, but was completely excluded from the nucleoli (Fig. 6B, images a, d, and g) . After 36 h transfection, the fluorescent signal was viewed in cytoplasm, but not in the nucleolus (Fig. 6B , images ai, di, and gi). These phenomena were consistent with our conjecture that the amino acid residues 23 RRRANNRRR 31 of protein \u2423 played a vital role in the nucleolus targeting of protein \u2423 in transfected cells. When the amino acids 23 RRR 25 or 29 RRR 31 were truncated from protein \u2423, the specific nucleolar localization of the EGFP-\u2423 fusion protein was abolished, indicating that both 23 RRR 25 and 29 RRR 31 were responsible for directing nucleolus localization, but individually incapable of localizing EGFP-\u2423 fusion proteins to the nucleoli.

At 36 h posttransfection, EGFP-RNA2/N43 was distributed in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm except the nucleolus (Fig. 7, image a) and EGFP/43aa was enriched in the nucleolus (Fig. 7, image d) .

In the present study, at various time points, about 10% of infected or transfected cells exhibited nucleolus and cytoplasmic localization of GGNNV protein \u2423. A possible reason for this observation could be that the fewer infected or transfected cells are at interphase, which showed localization of GGNNV protein \u2423 to the nucleolus, whereas other cells are in other phases of mitosis. also reported fewer cells with nucleolus local-ization of IBV N protein. However, mitosis alone cannot account for the absence of protein \u2423 from the nucleoli in the majority of infected or transfected cells, which suggests that localization of GGNNV protein \u2423 to the nucleoli might be dependent on particular events of the cycle that the infected or transfected cell is undergoing.",

Proteins less than 40 kDa are able to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion; others generally require a specific nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is ATP dependent. NLSs have been identified for a number of viral and cellular proteins which have been classified as either monopartite or bipartite, depending on whether or not stretches of basic residues are interrupted by a 10 amino acid space region (Garcia-Bustos et al., 1991) . Recently, several sequences have been defined as nucleolus localization signals. They consisted of clustered basic Arg/Lys residues and also functioned as nuclear transporting signals (Kubota et al., 1996; Siomi et al., 1988; Goatley et al., 1999; Zhu et al., 1999) . In this study, EGFP was used to study the subcellular localization of protein \u2423 and search for its NoLS. EGFP-\u2423 fusion protein with a mass of 67 kDa could not be expected to diffuse into the nucleoplasm unless it contained an NLS/NoLS. The results of subcellular fraction analysis indicate that EGFP protein can diffuse to the nucleus, but its concentration in the nuclear extract is low. However, when EGFP was fused with N-terminal 43 aa of protein \u2423, the fusion protein was mostly detected in the nuclear extract. So, we predicted that there must be a nucleolus localization signal in the 43 aa which contributes to the nucleolar localization of EGFP/43aa. There are two groups of basic amino acids in the N-terminal amino acids of protein \u2423: 2 RKGEKKLAK 10 and 23 RRRANNRRR 31 , which resembled nucleolar localization signals that have been described in other viral and cellular proteins. The distribution of the deletion mutants of protein \u2423 in transfected cells demonstrated that 23 RRRANNRRR 31 is a nucleolus localization signal. In this study, nucleolus localization signal of protein \u2423 was first identified in betanodaviruses, which may yield new insights into the mechanism of betanodaviruses infection. When 23 RRR 25 or 29 RRR 31 or 23 RRRANNRRR 31 was deleted from protein \u2423, EGFP fusion protein, which is too large (\u03fe40 kDa) to pass through the nuclear pore complexes by simple diffusion, was still observed in the nucleus. However, when the N-terminal 43 aa was deleted from protein \u2423, EGFP/RNA2/N43 disappeared from the nucleus. These observations led to the possible suggestion that the protein \u2423 may contain other signals within 43 aa, such as 2 RKGEKKLAK 10 , to be involved in its nuclear localization in the transfected and infected SB cells.",

            "text": "The mechanism of nucleolar localization of exogenous proteins depends on their nucleolar localization signals to bind either to an acid region in the nucleolus such as B23, or to rRNA, or to ribosome proteins (Li, 1997; Kubota et al., Fig. 7 . Subcellular localization of deletion mutations of protein \u2423 in SB cells. SB cells were transfected with pEGFP/RNA2/N43 (image a), pEGFP/43aa (image d), pEGFP/RNA2/d1RRR (image g), pEGFP/RNA2/ d2RRR (image j), and pEGFP/RNA2/d9aa (image m) and observed at 36 h posttransfection. SB cells expressing EGFP fusion proteins (green) and nuclear stained with DAPI (image b, e, h, k, n, and q, blue) are overlapped to form merged images c, f, i, l, and o, respectively. Red arrows indicate the location of nucleoli. 1999; Roller et al., 1996; Gorlich and Kutay, 1999) . B23 may serve as a shuttle for the import of protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus coupled to the export of viral mRNA (Qiu and Brown, 1999) . The nucleolin binding activity of hepatitis delta antigens (HDAgs) contributes to nucleolar localization and the modulation of the HDV replication (Lee et al., 1998) . Many other RNA viruses make use of their RNA-binding proteins to localize into nucleolus to promote disassembly and assembly of the virus particle, such as the RNA-binding proteins in coronavirus , alphaviruses (Wengler, 1984) , and alphanodaviruses (Hiscox and Ball, 1997) . Nucleocapsids of Semliki Forest virus bind to 28srRNA to facilitate the release of the viral RNA genome (Rikkonen et al., 1992) . Through the nucleoli of host cell, virus proteins appear to be involved in viral disassembly replication and assembly as well as in transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. The nucleolus localization proteins ICP27 (Mears et al., 1995) and US11 (Roller et al., 1996) of HSV-1 are involved in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by binding ribosomal 60s subunit. Although the mechanism by which the betanodavirus protein \u2423 was transported to the nucleolus was not elucidated in this study, the nucleolar localization signal in betanodavirus protein \u2423 has been demonstrated. The expression of protein \u2423 was detected in both nucleolus and cytoplasm of transfected and infected cells. Based on this we speculate that by using the nucleolus localization signal 23 RRRANNRRR 31 , protein \u2423 as the precursor of capsid protein could be imported to the nucleolus by a certain \"carrier.\" Similar to nuclear import, export of a protein depends on the presence of a specific nuclear export signal (NES) (Gorlich and Kutay, 1999) . These NES are short sequences characterized as being rich in leucine residues and have been identified in a variety of different proteins, the best study of which being the HIV Rev protein (Pollard and Malim, 1998) . Protein \u2423 was detected in both nucleolus and cytoplasm. Possibly the regions other than 1-43 amino acids might be NES to be involved in its nuclear export, which could explain the observed cytoplasmic localization in this study. However, by analyzing amino acids of protein \u2423, we were unable to definitely identify specific NES motifs in protein \u2423. Two different possibilities exist that explain the failure in our identification of protein \u2423 NES. First, the NES has an unusual sequence that was not identified by initial sequence homology comparisons to known NES. Second, protein \u2423 may in fact lack a NES but is exported from the nucleus in complex with another NES-containing protein. Additional studies will be necessary to examine the mechanism of protein \u2423 shuttle between nucleolus and cytoplasm.",

Localization of bax to nucleoli played a role in apoptosis-induction of glioma cells (Joy et al., 2000) . DEDD was involved in apoptosis caused by CD95 (Stegh et al., 1998) . In our previous work, protein \u2423 was found to induce apoptosis in transfected SB and Cos-7 cells. Although protein \u2423 failed to localize to the nucleolus when amino acids 23 RRRANNRRR 31 were deleted, the apoptosis could not be prevented in transfected SB and Cos-7 cells (data not shown), indicating there is no relationship between nucleolus localization of protein \u2423 and its ability to induce apoptosis. Since protein \u2423 is located in both cytoplasm and nucleolus in transfected and infected cells, its cytoplasm localization might be involved in its apoptosis.",

(B) Localization of EGFP-\u2423 fusion protein in SB and Cos-7 cells. SB or Cos-7 cells were transfected with pEGFP-RNA2 plasmid with lipofectamine plus reagents on Chamber slides. SB cell expressing EGFP-\u2423 fusion protein (images d and g, green), nuclear image stained with DAPI (images e and h, blue), and merged signals are shown (images f and i) at 12 and 36 h posttransfection. The merged image represents a superimposition of green and blue signals. The images were viewed with a Leica 550 IW fluorescence microscope and photographed in \u03eb1000 amplification. Cos-7 cell expressing EGFP-\u2423 fusion proteins (images D and G, green), nucleolus labeled with an antinucleolin mAb (images E and H, red), and merged signals (images F and I) are shown at 12 and 36 h posttransfection.

SB (lane 1 and 2) or Cos-7 (lane 3 and 4) cells transfected with 2 g plasmid pEGFP-RNA2 (lane 1, lane 3) or pEGFP-C1 (lane 2 and 4) were harvested at 48 h posttransfection and assayed using antiprotein \u2423 sera by Western blot analysis.nucleolus was confirmed by using mAb against nucleolin with indirect immunofluorescence assay(Fig. 2B, images B, E, and H). The merged images(Fig. 2B, images C, F, and I) represent overlapping of green and red signals in yelloworange. At 36 h posttransfection, equal aliquots of cell lysates from SB and Cos-7 cells transiently expressing EGFP-\u2423 fusion protein were analyzed by Western blot with antiprotein \u2423 antibody. A protein of the expected size of 66.3 kDa was detected in both SB(Fig. 2C, lane 1)and Cos-7(Fig. 2C, lane 3)cells that were transfected with pEGFP-RNA2, but not in cells transfected with pEGFP-C1(Fig. 2C, lane 2 and 4).",
