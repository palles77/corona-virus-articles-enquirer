On May 29, 2015, a business traveler from the Republic of Korea was identified as the first imported case of MERS-CoV infection in China [2] [3] . The World Health Organization (WHO) received notifications of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection from the Republic of Korea mid May 2015 [4] [5] . The WHO was notified later that one close contact of the index MERS case in the Republic of Korea travelled to Guangdong Province, China, by way of Hong Kong. The first MERS-CoV case in China imported from the Republic of Korea was confirmed by The National Health and Family Commission of the People's Republic of China on May 29, 2015 [2] [3] . The patient was admitted to Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital, Huizhou, Guangdong Province on May 28, 2015 and was discharged after recovery on June 26, 2015. A set of venous blood samples was collected after his admission.",

MERS S1-based ELISA results showed that the OD450 value for the calibrator recommended by EUROIMMUN was 0.43 which was defined as the cut-off value, consequently, anti-MERS S1IgG in the MERS patient exceeded the cut-off value 8 days after admission ( Figure 2B) , consistent with the results reported by Guan et al.

Although seroconversion of anti-MERS-CoV S1 IgG appeared two days earlier than that of inactivated MERS-CoV, similar antibody kinetics based on MERS S1 and inactivated MERS-CoV appeared and there was high correlation coeffieient of 0.9331 between them ( Figure 2C) .",

Cells were washed with PBS and lysed using the lysis reagent included in the luciferase kit (Promega). Aliquots of cell lysates were transferred to 96-well Costar flat-bottom luminometer plates (Corning Costar), followed by addition of luciferase substrate (Promega). RFI values were determined immediately using a Gaomax luminometer (Promega). A 50% RFI reduction was used to calculate MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibody titers in serum samples. Fifty-three paired serum samples from 53 close contacts that may have been exposed to the imported MERS-CoV patient were collected at an interval of at least 14 d. All of the sera were diluted 1:80 and subjected to inactivated MERS-CoV-based ELISA. HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG was used as the secondary antibody, with TMB as the substrate, and the absorbance was read at 450 nm.

As of October 31, 2015, 186 cases (including the MERS case exported to China) of MERS-CoV infection have been associated with the South Korea outbreak, 36 of whom died [4] [5] . There have been several reports of household or nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV to healthcare workers in hospitals with MERS-CoV patients and/or delayed implementation of effective infection control practices [5, 8] . When the imported MERS-CoV patient in China was admitted on June 28, he was suffering from high fever, and real-time RT-PCR indicated a high viral load in serum and throat swab samples. Seroconversion often occurs 10-14 d after exposure, so we performed serological detection on paired serum samples to minimize the possibility of missing asymptomatic infection. However, none of the 53 close contacts were positive for MERS-CoV, which suggest that none community transmission of MERS-CoV occurred in China. The lack of transmission of MERS-CoV from the patient to the close contacts in this study may have been due to several factors: 1) the short duration of exposure, and more importantly, 2) implementation by China of strict infection prevention and control practices immediately after being notified of importation of the MERS-CoV patient. These findings are similar to the results of an investigation of healthcare workers following importation of the first MERS case into the USA [9] .",

We determined the kinetics of antibody (IgG and IgM) and neutralizing antibodies against MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in this case before discharge. Moreover, no seroconversion was found among 53 close contacts by anti-MERS IgG antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of paired serum samples.
