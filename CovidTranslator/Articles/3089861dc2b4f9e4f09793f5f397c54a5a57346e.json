We have now successfully expressed protein C using the baculovirus system in S. frugiperda (Sf-9) cells. This recombinant baculovirus expressing protein C was first characterized using five SARS convalescent human sera and five normal human sera. The results showed that protein C is an authentic antigen against SARS-CoV antibody. Our Spike protein-based immunoflourescence assay (IFA) based on this recombinant baculovirus-Sf-9 system was further assessed with a panel of 163 clinical samples collected during the SARS epidemic in Singapore, which include samples from 21 clinically confirmed SARS, 42 non-SARS patient sera, and 100 normal sera. The results were compared to a commercial SARS IFA kit (EUROIMMUN, Germany) and a conventional IFA test performed in Singapore General Hospital. All of the 21 SARS-positive serum samples could be recognized by our IFA, giving a specificity and sensitivity of 100%, which was compatible with both whole virus-based IFA assays. No cross-reactivity with serum samples against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were detected in our assays. Thus, our Spike proteinbased IFA could offer a safer procedure which can be performed in a BSL-2 laboratory as it could mimic the whole virus based-IFA without any loss of sensitivity and specificity. It is also more user-friendly and cost-effective than the whole virus-based IFA. D",

Their genome of around 30 kb is the largest found in RNA viruses, encoding 23 putative proteins, which include 4 major structural proteins: Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and small envelope (E). The Spike protein is a large membrane glycoprotein that forms 180-to 190-kDa peplomers that bind to receptors on CoVsusceptible cells and induce cell fusion. S protein is also a well-known neutralizing antigen of many coronavirus (Homberger, 1994; Jackwood and Hilt, 1995; Callebaut et al., 1996; Gomez et al., 1998) .

Although it is more sensitive and specific than a serological assay, the drawback of using real-time RT-PCR is that the equipment is very expensive. Differences in optimization of RNA extraction, delays in processing specimens, and deterioration of samples may further lower the efficiency of the assay. These drawbacks make real-time RT-PCR a difficult procedure to use in the majority of clinical laboratories, especially those in developing countries.",

            "text": "Currently, the more commonly used diagnostic assay for the detection of SARS-CoV is the detection of antibodies by immunoflourescence assay (IFA). IFA is recognized as the bgold stand-ardQ (Tang et al., 2004) . It uses inactivated SARS-CoV-infected cells fixed on a slide as antigen to detect SARS antibody in serum samples. It is known that conventional whole virus IFA can detect positive SARS-CoV infection using sera collected as early as 8 days. However, conventional whole virus IFA is not so convenient since it initially utilizes infectious SARS-CoV to infect cell culture before fixating on the slides. Although the inactivated IFA slides can be handled in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) laboratories, the initial infection procedure needs to be carried out in a BSL-3 research facility. This makes the whole virus IFA difficult to perform in most laboratories, as there is a risk of contamination when dealing with live virus. Due to the current problems and safety issues with the whole virus IFA, a safer serological assay with little risk of contamination is needed for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection. This has led to the development of Nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA and immunoblot assays. However, until recently, little information has been available to evaluate Spike protein-based immunoassays for the detection of specific antibodies in SARS patients.",

Analysis of the SARS-CoV genome shows that this virus does not belong to any of the three classes described above, although it has the same genome organization as other coronaviruses. Further interpretation suggests that SARS-CoV proteins share low homology with other known coronaviruses (Rota et al., 2003) . The SARS-CoV Spike gene encodes a glycoprotein of approximately 150 kDa containing 1255 amino acids, which is normally cleaved into an S1 domain and an S2 domain (Jackwood et al., 2001) . Recently, an angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-recognizing site has been identified in the Spike protein S1 domain as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV in humans (Li et al., 2003) . The Spike protein may mediate membrane fusion and induce neutralization antibodies in the host, raising the possibility that antibodies against the SARS-CoV Spike protein may be a good marker for early detection and neutralization of SARS-CoV infections.",

After incubation for another 36 h at 28 8C, the infected Sf-9 cells were fixed to the plate with 100% ethanol for 30 min at room temperature. The cells in each well were reacted with human serum samples at 1:100 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at 37 8C in a moist chamber. Following this, the cells were washed in PBST twice at 10-min intervals. FITC-conjugated rabbit antihuman immunoglobulin G, IgG (DAKO, Cat no. F0202) at 1:50 dilution was used for fluorescent studies. The optimal serum dilution was previously determined to be 1:100 for Ig-total detection (data not shown). As a positive control, antibody-specific protein C at 1:100 dilution and FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-guinea pig immunoglobulins (DAKO, Cat no. F0233) at 1:50 were used. To test for cross-reactivity, the Sf-9 cells were incubated with TGEV and IBV serum samples at 1:100 dilution and FITC-conjugate rabbit antiswine immunoglobulins (DAKO, Cat No. F0235) and FITCconjugate rabbit antichicken immunoglobulins (DAKO, Cat No. F888), respectively. The staining patterns of Sf-9 cells were examined with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus) using a 20\u00c2 objective and a 10\u00c2 eye piece with appropriate barrier and excitation filters for optimized FITC visualization. Signals were captured by a digital camera imaging system (Nikon). The optimal conditions were defined to be the reaction in which maximum fluorescent signals were observed with no background.",

We have compared the sequences of our protein C, 441 to 700 a.a. of Spike protein with the ACE2 recognizing site and found that the ACE2 recognition domain is overlapping in our protein C. This sequence is found in the S1 domain of SARS-CoV spike protein and has a high affinity to ACE2. This ACE2 recognition domain is important as it grants SARS-CoV the ability to bind and mediate virus entry in cells, causing infection and hence inducing an early immune response. Because protein C overlaps with the ACE2 recognition site, we believe that antibody against protein C may be a good candidate for the development of effective and sensitive detection assays for SARS-CoV. In this study, we are the first to show that the immunogenic protein C-based IFA is a sensitive and specific method for detecting SARS-CoV infection.",

The technique is simple and inexpensive to perform with acceptable sensitivity and specificity in the detection of SARS-CoV infection. IFA is also known for its ability to detect antibody responses, as early as 8 days. Therefore, we have developed an IFA technique using recombinant baculovirus expressing the C domain of Spike protein in Sf-9 cells. Our Spike protein-based IFA using the antigenic protein C had a sensitivity and specificity of 100%, which was comparable to the conventional and commercial IFAs (Table 2) . We observed a bringQ fluorescence pattern in our Spike protein-based IFA, as well as in the conventional and commercial SARS IFA when analyzing positive human sera. Further localization studies using an inverted confocal microscope showed that protein C was localized in the cytoplasm of Sf-9 cells, thus forming a bringQ fluorescence pattern (Fig. 1b) . However, in terms of sensitivity in the detection of SARS-CoV antibody in serum samples, our Spike protein-based IFA utilized one-tenth of the serum used in the commercial IFA. We have conducted experiments to optimize the conditions used for the IFA and we have identified the best dilution of serum (data not shown). We found that the Spike protein-based IFA can detect SARS-CoV specific antibody at a lower dilution of 1:100, compared to the 1:10 dilution for commercial and conventional IFAs. This might be due to the overexpression of protein C in our system. Thus, our Spike protein-based IFA is more sensitive compared to the existing IFAs. Moreover, protein C is able to mimic the antigenicity of the whole SARS-CoV although it was developed on the basis of a truncated immunogenic fragment, from 441 to 700 a.a. of Spike protein. Future development of an assay with protein C of the Spike protein will now be possible.",
