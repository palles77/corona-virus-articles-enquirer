Data showing inhibition of HSV-1 and CMV replication, when GA is administered post-infection, suggest a possible secondary mechanism targeting protein and DNA synthesis. Thus, in light of the strong effect of GA on viral infection, even after the infection begins, it may potentially be used to treat acute infections (e.g. Coronavirus, EBOV, ZIKV, IAV and measles), and also topically for the successful treatment of active lesions (e.g. HSV-1, HSV-2 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)).",

Ginkgo biloba extracts (GBE) have been used as herbal supplements since at least the 16 th century and remain widely in use 1 . Major constituents of GBE include terpine trilactones (ginkgolide A, B, C, J, and bilobalide), flavonoid glycosides (quercetin and rutin), as well as Ginkgolic acids 2 . Ginkgolic acids are a mixture of several 2-hydroxy-6-alkylbenzoic acids in which the most common alkyl chains contain 13, 15, or 17 carbons. The 15 and 17 carbon chains are unsaturated at positions 8 and 10, respectively. The 3 Ginkgolic acid (GA) structures are, therefore, designated C13:0, C15:1, and C17:1 (Table S1) 3 . GA has shown pleiotropic effects in vitro, including: antitumor effects through inhibition of lipogenesis; decreased expression of invasion associated proteins through AMPK activation; potential rescue of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) induced synaptic impairment; and inhibition of HIV protease activity as well as HIV viral replication 4-7 . GA was also reported to have activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus 8 . Several ways in which GA works have been suggested including by SUMOylation inhibition activity; blocking formation of the E1-SUMO intermediate 9 ; inhibition of fatty acid synthase 10 ; non-specific SIRT inhibition 11 ; and activation of protein phosphatase type-2C 12 .",

HFF monolayers in 24-well plates pretreated with GA (1-20 \u00b5M) for 1 h were inoculated with 50-100 plaque-forming units of CMVPT30-GFP per well. 16 , (Fig. 1B) . The number of plaques were counted after 7 days and the IC 50 was determined. As predicted by the previously-determined IC 50 , at 5 and at 10 \u00b5M the antiviral effect was apparent. Furthermore, at 10 \u00b5M, only single cells were infected, indicating that there was no cell-to-cell virus transmission. These results may be explained as inhibition of secondary infections or that viral entry may be a target of GA. To verify these results, we compared the inhibition of infection by GA using a plaque reduction assay (PRA) similar to the PRA for ganciclovir (GCV), the preferred antiviral HCMV drug of choice. The results showed that although there was strong inhibition of the virus at 16 \u00b5M GCV, there were still visible plaques (>5 adjacent cells showing HCMV cytopathic effect) indicating cell-to-cell transmission of the virions. On the contrary, CMVPT30-GFP infected monolayers that were treated with 10 \u00b5M GA only displayed individual infected cells in intact HFF monolayers, (Fig. 1C) , thus indicating no cell-cell transmission. We also tested GA C17:1 and GA C13:0. Both GA compounds had a strong inhibitory effect on HCMV infection by PRA, similar to GA C15:1 (Fig. 1D,E) . None of the GA structures showed cytotoxicity at their active concentrations, respectively.",

To test whether GA inhibits HSV-1, we designed an experiment to test the direct effect of GA on the virus. For this experiment, we used HEp-2 and 293T cells. 1 \u00d7 10 7 PFU HSV-1 strain F was treated for 1 hour with GA (50 \u00b5M) or with vehicle in serum free DMEM and then each of these were used to infect HEp2 or 293T cells at an MOI of 0.5 in 199V medium with a final concentration of 2.5 \u00b5M GA. As a control, the virus that was originally treated with the vehicle was then supplemented also with 2.5 \u00b5M GA. To test for successful viral infection of HEp2 and 293T cells, production of HSV-1 immediate early (ICP27), early (ICP8), and late (US11) proteins was analyzed by Western Blot (Fig. 2A,B) . The results showed that in the treated HSV-1 F stock there was complete inhibition of viral replication, as indicated by lack of protein synthesis. This implies that viral entry may be a target of GA, because direct treatment of HSV-1 with GA blocks downstream HSV-1 protein production. To test the effect of GA on HSV-1 replication, HEp2 cell monolayers were grown to 90% confluency in a 6-well plate, treated with 10 \u00b5M GA C15:1 or vehicle for 1 hour in 199V medium, and then inoculated with HSV-1 strain F for protein analysis. HSV-1 ICP27, ICP8, and US11 proteins were detected by Western Blot (Fig. 2C) . The results showed profound inhibition of immediate early, early, and late viral proteins. The inhibition of the full temporal range of HSV-1 proteins implies that inhibition of viral replication occurs by blocking the entry of virions into the target cell. To evaluate the effect of GA on progeny virions, the supernatant of GFP-HSV-1 strain 17+ infected Vero cells at an MOI of 1 was collected after 20 h and titered by plaque reduction assay (Fig. 2D) . The results showed a significant decrease of approximately 2 log in the GA-treated cell titers.",

The next day, supernatant was replaced with fresh medium containing GA or DMSO and cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . On day 7, viability was determined with the MTS Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega), and then these cells were harvested to extract total RNA for quantification of ZIKV RNA by Taqman based qRT-PCR. The results showed 70% to 80% viability at 5 \u00b5M to 20 \u00b5M GA, compared to less than 40% viability for the vehicle-treated cells. Furthermore, an 80-90% decrease in ZIKV RNA was observed at 5 \u00b5M to 20 \u00b5M GA (Fig. 3A ,B). We concluded that GA inhibits entry of Zika virions and prevents NHA cell death. This suggests that the mechanism of inhibition that appears to be targeted in HSV and HCMV by GA is conserved among enveloped viruses that have no homologous glycoproteins and use different cell receptors for entry. To test the direct effect of GA on ZIKV, 5 \u00d7 10 5 PFU ZIKV were treated for 1 hour with GA (10 \u00b5M/ml) or with vehicle in 199V medium, and then were used to infect Vero cells at an MOI of 0.5. Supernatant was collected at 4, 24 and 48 hours post-inoculation for cell free viral RNA copy number determination (Fig. 3C) . The results indicated that the GA-treated ZIKV was completely inhibited, as indicated by cell free ZIKV RNA copy number. This suggests that viral entry of ZIKV, may be a target of GA because direct treatment of ZIKV with GA blocks downstream ZIKV RNA production.",

Viral fusion, regardless of fusion protein, proceeds through the creation of hemifusion, an intermediate state in which proximal lipid monolayer leaflets of membranes, in contact with one another, have merged, but the distal monolayers remain distinct. Because inhibition of fusion was universal, independent of viral protein, it is extremely unlikely that GA targeted the fusion proteins themselves. This is consistent with GA inhibiting the creation of the hemifusion intermediate, and universal inhibition would be expected. It is well known that agents conferring positive spontaneous curvature, such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), inhibit fusion induced by viral and non-viral fusion proteins 17 . Likewise, the cone-shaped lipid oleic acid (OA) has a negative spontaneous membrane curvature, which favors hemifusion when present in the outer bilayer, and its presence relieves the inhibition of fusion 18 . The addition of OA together with GA abolished the inhibitory effect of GA (Fig. 6B) , indicating that GA induces positive membrane curvature. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/",

The effect of GA was tested in several cell types including HEp-2 (human epithelial carcinoma), 293T (human embryonic kidney), HFF and NHA (normal human astrocytes).

Viral infections of permissive cells are regularly performed in 199 or MEM medium supplemented with 1% or 2% FBS. However, when we tested the activity and toxicity of GA on the cells used in our research, we also incubated the cells with GA in the cells' recommended growth medium (see results and Fig. S1 ). The results indicated that the activity and toxicity of GA is affected by the serum concentration in the medium. We concluded that GA interacts with serum factors, which lowers its antiviral activity, and researchers using GA should address this issue in future experiments. In vivo experiments in an animal model are needed to assess the actual therapeutic antiviral effect and cytotoxicity of GA.",

            "text": "GA's universal inhibition of viral protein-mediated cell-cell fusion indicates that its inhibitory effect is by a common fusion mechanism. LPC also universally blocks membrane fusion; it does so by conferring spontaneous positive curvature, which prevents hemifusion. This block can be relieved, regardless of fusion protein, by the addition of the negative spontaneous curvature agent OA 25, 26 . The finding that OA relieves the GA-induced inhibition of EBOV GP-mediated fusion implies that, similar to LPC, GA acts by producing positive spontaneous curvature and this prevents hemifusion. A number of rigid amphipathic fusion inhibitors (RAFI) with positive spontaneous curvature have been shown to inhibit fusion induced by unrelated viral fusion proteins 27 . In the www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ future, it would be interesting to measure the values of the spontaneous curvatures of GA and RAFI and to relate them to the concentration of OA necessary to relieve fusion inhibition. For the inhibition of non-enveloped adenovirus, we suggest that since GA affects lipid bilayer curvature, it would be predicted to affect the endocytic entry of a non-enveloped virus such as adenovirus. In addition, as we report here, GA appears to have potential secondary mechanisms of viral DNA and protein synthesis inhibition, and these would be predicted to be targeted in both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.",

Fusion experiments for each viral protein were performed as previously described: EBOV GP 32 ; HIV 33 ; SFV E1/E2 and IAV HA 34 ; VEEV E, VSV, and EBV 35 . Unless stated otherwise, EBOV GP was used as the fusion protein and C15:1 GA was used to inhibit fusion. As shown in Fig. 2B , C15:1 GA inhibited fusion for the eight tested fusion proteins. Figure 2C documents that fusion was blockaded by GA C13:0, C15:1, or C17:1.",
