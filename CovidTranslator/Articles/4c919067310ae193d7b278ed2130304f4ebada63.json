However, diagnostic results must be accurate, timely, and available. Accuracy depends on the skills of the microscopist; RDT and PCR results reflect the performance characteristics of the assay. RDTs have high sensitivity for P. falciparum but can be lower for non-falciparum malaria. Presumptive treatment is not recommended, and facilities managing returning travelers should ensure an accurate diagnostic test result can be obtained within 6 hours.",

Most patients demonstrate clinical improvement and resolution of fever within 48 to 72 hours. The main differential diagnosis is a pyogenic liver abscess; patients with sepsis require broad-spectrum antibiotics until the diagnosis is confirmed. Surgical or percutaneous drainage is rarely required and should only be considered if there is diagnostic uncertainty, symptoms persist after 4 days of treatment, or there is imminent risk of rupture into critical sites (e.g., left-lobe abscess rupturing into the pericardium). 34 After treatment, patients should be given 10 days of a luminal amebicide to prevent relapse: diloxanide furoate (500 mg orally three times daily) or paromomycin (30 mg/kg orally in three divided doses).",
