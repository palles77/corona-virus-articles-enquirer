In order to understand the origin and evolution of the SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus), we collected complete genome sequences of all viruses available in GenBank, and made comparative analyses with the SARS-CoV. Genomic signature analysis demonstrates that the coronaviruses all take the TGTT as their richest tetranucleotide except the SARS-CoV. A detailed analysis of the forty-two complete SARS-CoV genome sequences revealed the existence of two distinct genotypes, and showed that these isolates could be classified into four groups. Our manual analysis of the BLASTN results demonstrates that the HE (hemagglutinin-esterase) gene exists in the SARS-CoV, and many mutations made it unfamiliar to us.",

According to their genome sizes, the 2,498 virus isolates can be classified as three groups. The first group, also the smallest group corresponding to the low part of the figure, represents the viroids. The range of genome sizes of this group is between 120 bp (Avocado sunblotch viroid; NCBI accession number: AF404074) and 374 bp (Citrus exocortis viroids, NCBI accession number: N30870). The range of the GC content is between 35.5% (Avocado sunblotch viroid; genome size: 248 bp; NCBI accession number: AF404068) and 61.1% (Grapevine yellow speckle viroid 1; genome size: 365 bp; NCBI accession number: AF462165). Here, the two isolates of AF404068 and AF404074 demonstrate the sequence diversity of viroid genomes. Although they are only different isolates of Avocado sunblotch viroid, the difference of their genome sizes is still great. The third group, also the largest group corresponding to the middle part of the figure, is the most complicated one that includes all other kinds of viruses. The SARS-CoV belongs to this group.

BLASTN (default parameters) was used to compare the SARS-CoV genomic sequence with the dataset of non-coronaviruses, and sequences more than 20 nt in length and identity greater than 70% were extracted to create the conservative map ( Figure 2 ). The coronaviruses are phylogenetically close to the SARS-CoV. To demonstrate their respective similar regions to the SARS-CoV, we mapped the comparison results to BJ01 sequence to see the distribution. As shown in Figure 3 , the SARS-CoV genomic fragments are plotted along the horizontal axis in the order they appeared in the genome, and other coronaviruses are placed vertically. The darkness of a pixel corresponds to the strength of the match between a SARS-CoV fragment and a coronavirus genome, and the width of the rectangle corresponds to the length of the matched sequence. The length of the longest matched segment is 138 nt (Codons 14,914-15,051) with the identity of about 81.16% (112/138). This segment lies in the gene coding region of the R (replicase) protein of SARS-CoV.",

The analysis results with the motif length from 2 to 8 nt all demonstrate that the SARS-CoV is most adjacent to coronaviruses. Here we only show the comparison result with coronaviruses since the distances with non-coronavirus are very large. To present the similarity of the MFP between the SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses more clearly, we use the chaos game representation (CGR) to demonstrate the results. Only one isolate is selected to represent its species because the MFP of different isolates within the same species is very similar. To find whether there is a relationship between the viruses and their hosts, we also demonstrate the MFP of Homo Sapiens (host of the SARS-CoV) and Mus Musculus (host of the MHV). Figure 4 presents the dinucleotide frequency profile. It is obvious that the frequency of dinucletide TT is rich in all the eight organisms. BJ01, MHV and PEDV (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus) have another similar characteristic of the high frequency of TG. The obvious difference between BJ01 and other coronaviruses is that the AA frequency of BJ01 is higher. This AA-rich characteristic is the same to Homo Sapiens, so probably in SARS-CoV it is influenced by its host\u2212Homo Sapiens. The result that the MFPs of Homo Sapiens and mouse are very similar to each other is in accordance with the phylogenetic analysis. The lower frequency of CG in all the images could be easily explained by the reason that there is a relatively high chance of a methyl-C mutation into a T. Theoretically, the C-T methyl mutation should induce the frequency increase of TG, while the result shows that the frequency of TG is not high in about six organisms out of the eight. So there should be some other mechanisms that lead to the decrease of TG in these organisms.",

We found out that at motif length 4, almost all the tetranucleotide of coronaviruses with the highest frequency are TGTT except those in SARS-CoV ( Figure 5 ). The richest tetranucleotide of the SARS-CoV is TGCT, while TGTT is the second. This fact demonstrates that the SARS-CoV is phylogenetically far from other coronaviruses, and this conclusion is the same as the serological analysis result. To see whether this characteristic is unique to coronaviruses, we searched 2,497 virus genomes, and found only two viruses, Beet soil-borne mosaic virus (genome size: 4,616 bp; NCBI accession number: AF061869) and Soil-borne cereal mosaic virus (genome size: 3,683 bp; NCBI accession number: AJ132577), have this characteristic. Both these two exceptions are ssRNA positively stranded viruses and belong to two different subspecies: Furovirus and Benyvirus. We computed the TGTT content of coronavirus genomes and the result is shown in Table 1 . As a comparison, the contents of other viruses have also been computed, but the results are not listed here. The lowest content is 0.13% appeared in TT-like mini virus (NCBI accession number: AF291073), and the highest content is 7.33% in HCoV-229. The difference of TGTT frequency between different viruses is great. Nothing significant is found at other motif lengths. Thus the richest tetranucleotide, TGTT, could be a common characteristic of coronaviruses.",

Generally speaking, if two organisms were adjacent in evolution, their codon usage bias should be similar (7 ). We made statistics of the codon usage frequency of all viruses and computed the standard deviation of their codon usage frequency relative to BJ01. When we computed the codon usage frequency of the SARS-CoV, the five function-known gene-coding regions for the R, S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), N (nucleocapsid) and five putative uncharacterized proteins (PUP) were all analyzed (8 ) . Results show that all other coronaviruses have a small difference of codon usage frequency with the SARS-CoV. Astonishingly, some viruses that do not belong to coronavirus also have the same difference with the SARS-CoV, such as human papillomavirus (NCBI accession number: U85660).
