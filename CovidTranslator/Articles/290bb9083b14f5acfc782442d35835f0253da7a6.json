Although significant morbidity and mortality have been attributed to acute diarrheal illnesses in the United States, epidemiologic studies in this country have not been as comprehensive as those conducted in developing nations. The CDC, however, estimate that there are more than 350 million cases of acute diarrheal illnesses in the United States annually. Acute gastroenteritis compares with upper respiratory illnesses as the most common infectious disease syndrome. 2, 3 Using data from the National Center for Health Statistics, the CDC recently reported that deaths from all-cause gastroenteritis increased from approximately 7000 to more than 17,000 per year from 1999 to 2007. Adults over 65 years old made up 83% of these deaths and C difficile accounted for two-thirds of these deaths, reflecting that the most significant morbidity and mortality are experienced by the extremes of age. 4 ",

In addition, stool cultures, which are used to identify bacterial causes of gastroenteritis, are only positive in 1.5% to 5.6% of cases. 5 Viral causes of acute gastroenteritis are dominated by rotavirus and norovirus. In the United States, it is estimated that 15 to 25 million episodes of viral gastroenteritis occur each year, leading to 3 to 5 million office visits and 200,000 hospitalizations. 6, 7 Rotavirus causes a particularly severe dehydrating gastroenteritis that affects young children. The severity of the infection is made worse by malnourishment, making rotavirus a significant cause of mortality in children worldwide, responsible for approximately 500,000 deaths annually. 8, 9 The introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in the United States and Europe has been effective at reducing rotavirus gastroenteritis. There has been a 67% decrease in positive laboratory diagnosis attributed to vaccination. 10 Norovirus, however, causes the most outbreaks of nonbacterial acute gastroenteritis in all age groups. It often occurs in epidemic outbreaks in schools, nursing homes, cruise ships, prisons, and other group settings. Symptoms of severe vomiting are usually self-limited, lasting 12 to 60 hours. Transmission of this stable virus is through the fecal-oral route, with viral shredding lasting on average 10 to 14 days after onset of symptoms. 11 ",

Oral rehydration is ideal, but intravenous hydration may be necessary in the setting of dehydration. Antibiotics may shorten the course by 1 to 2 days. Travelers often request a prescription for antibiotics that may be taken at the onset of symptoms. Ciprofloxacin (500 mg as a single dose or twice a day for 1-2 days) is commonly sufficient, although resistance to quinolones is increasing, especially for Campylobacter jejuni. Quinolones are not Food and Drug Administration approved for pregnancy Graves or for treating traveler's diarrhea in children. Azithromycin is appropriate in these groups. In adults, a single 1-g dose is effective. In children, recommended dosing is 10 mg/kg as a single dose, not to exceed 1 g. Rifaximin (200 mg 3 times a day) has been shown effective and, with increasing quinolone resistance, it is increasingly used. 16 Antimotility agents, such as loperamide or diphenoxylate, can decrease stool frequency but do not alter the course of the infection. Their use should be avoided in cases of fever or rectal bleeding. Lactobacillus GG, a specific probiotic, has been shown to decrease diarrhea caused by the pathogens that typically cause traveler's gastroenteritis. Other Lactobacillus preparations, however, using nonviable probiotics, have not. 17, 18 Prevention In 2001, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published guidelines to assist travelers in decreasing their chances of contracting traveler's diarrhea:",

Data from this 10-site study that covers 46 million cases suggests that 1 in 5 episodes of gastroenteritis are caused by foodborne pathogens. Data from 2010 show little significant overall change in the known foodborne causes of acute gastroenteritis over the past 4 years. The data did, however, show a decline in Shiga toxin-producing E coli O157:H7 and Shigella. Vibrio gastroenteritis increased over this time period and Salmonella incidence was unchanged, despite increasing awareness and efforts to decrease these infections. In general, treatment of foodborne gastroenteritis can range in cost from $78 in Montana to $162 in New Jersey. The total cost per case, including productivity losses, can be as high as $1506, as noted in Connecticut. 3 There is also research suggesting, however, a significant presence of unspecified agents causing 38.4 million cases of foodborne acute gastroenteritis. 19 Reasons for this include a limited amount of data because not all cases of foodborne gastroenteritis are reported nor is a specific etiology identified; other microbes or chemicals in food could cause or contribute to illness; and, finally, new causes being discovered and known causes, such as C difficile, not thought to be transmitted by food, have been detected in retail meat products, 19 suggesting a new route of transmission.",

ETEC Transmission: ingestion of food or water contaminated by infected fecal matter 21 The CDC estimate that greater than 90% of HUS is associated with E coli O157:H7. HUS is often seen in children younger than 4 years old and the elderly. There is some concern that empiric antibiotic use may increase the risk of developing HUS. 22 Long-term sequelae caused by this complication include, hypertension, proteinuria, decreased glomerular filtration rate, and, less commonly, seizure, coma, or motor deficits. 23 Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, which shares many similar features with HUS, presents with prominent neurologic findings rather than renal failure. Rarely, pseudomembranous colitis is associated with E coli O157:H7. Treatment: Treatment is largely supportive. Antibiotics do not shorten the duration of illness and should be avoided. There is some thought that empiric antibiotics or antiperistaltics may increase the chance of developing complications. 24",

The use of multiple antibiotics and duration of antibiotic are associated with an increased risk of C difficile infection. Patients older than 65 years of age and those who are immunocompromised are at an increased risk of developing C difficile colitis, likely related to comorbid conditions. 27 The prevalence of C difficile associated colitis is increasing in the United States, both in pediatric and adult admissions. From 2001 to 2006, pediatric C difficile admissions increased from 2.6 to 4 cases per 1000. 28 The National Hospital Discharge Survey found the rate for C difficile colitis increased from 31 per 100,000 in 1996 to 61 per 100,000 in 2003. 29 Antibiotics most often associated with C difficile infection are flouroquinolones, clindamycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Those least associated with C difficile infection include doxycycline, aminoglycosides, vancomycin, and metronidazole. Proton pump inhibitors have also been associated with increased susceptibility to C difficile Acute Gastroenteritis infection.

They are also resistant to alcohol-based hand sanitizer, so caregivers must wash their hands in soap and water. Once in the colon, the bacteria become functional and produce toxin A (enterotoxin) and toxin B (cytotoxin). Both toxins lead to inflammation, mucosal injury, and secretory diarrhea. 31 Although toxin B is more virulent than toxin A, they both inactivate regulatory pathways, causing cell apoptosis, mucosal ulceration, and neutrophil chemotaxis to produce the pseudomembranes, common in this infection. 32 Pseudomenbranes are composed of neutrophils, fibrin, epithelial debris, and mucin. Pseudomembranes are not found in all patients, for example, those with ulcerative colitis or who are on immunosuppressive agents, such as steroids or cyclosporine. 33 The hypothesized reason for this is that pseudomembranes develop because of the host immunoreactions. 33 A new strain of C difficile, hypervirulent North American pulsed-field type 1 (NAP1/ 027/III), has been suspected in epidemic outbreaks since the early 2000s. It produces a binary toxin in addition to larger quantities of toxin A and toxin B and is associated with increasing incidence and severity of illness. It is resistant to fluoroquinolones. 1 It is associated with community onset and there is concern for transmission via animals and retail meat. 34 ",

The absence of fever (or only a low-grade fever) helps differentiate EHEC from other bacterial causes of bloody acute gastroenteritis. Duration: 1 week for uncomplicated EHEC infection Diagnosis: The CDC recommend all stool cultures be screened for E coli O157:H and certainly all bloody stool samples. Fecal leukocytes are present in 50% of cases. E coli O157:H7 can be screened for using a sorbitol MacConkey agar. Both stool cultures and toxin assays are recommended. Complications: Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is associated with Shiga toxin 2 and is a complication seen in 6% to 9% of EHEC causes of acute gastroenteritis.",
