            "text": "Understanding dynamics of an infectious disease helps in designing appropriate strategies for containing its spread in a population. Recent mathematical models are aimed at studying dynamics of some specific types of infectious diseases. In this paper we propose a new model for infectious diseases spread having susceptible, infected, and recovered populations and study its dynamics in presence of incubation delays and relapse of the disease. The influence of treatment and vaccination efforts on the spread of infection in presence of time delays are studied. Sufficient conditions for local stability of the equilibria and change of stability are derived in various cases. The problem of global stability is studied for an important special case of the model. Simulations carried out in this study brought out the importance of treatment rate in controlling the disease spread. It is observed that incubation delays have influence on the system even under enhanced vaccination. The present study has clearly brought out the fact that treatment rate even in presence of time delays would contain the disease as compared to popular belief that eradication can only be done through vaccination.",

The dynamics may well be understood by modeling causes or carriers of the disease. It is not possible all the time to control the media or carriers involved in spread of the infection and sometimes it may even be beyond determination. Many a time, we may not even recognize the presence of an infection until it becomes predominant. Mathematical modeling is a tool that has been popularly employed in prevention and control of infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1] , human immunodeficiency virus infection/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) [4] , H5N1 (avian flu) [37] and H1N1 (swine flu) [35] . Also, they have been useful in studying some of the drug resistant strains of malaria [12] , tuberculosis [5] , methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [17] and marine bacteriophage infection [3] . Simple deterministic models are based on dividing the population into compartments such as susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered. The susceptible-Infective (SI) model is useful in understanding diseases such as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [26] as the host remain infected till they die. The susceptible-infective-susceptible (SIS) model is employed in studying infections such as Gonorrhea [31] as there is a possibility of host becoming susceptible to infection once again. The susceptible-infective-recovered (SIR) model is employed to understand diseases such as Syphilis [33] , wherein, immunity lasts for a limited period before waning such that the individual is once again susceptible.

In the former case conditions under which pathogens suffer extinction leaving individuals as susceptible are studied, whereas in the later, conditions in which infective and susceptible populations coexist are established.",

            "text": "Interactions among populations in compartments such as the susceptible \u00f0x\u00de and infected \u00f0y\u00de is the key to understand the rate at which the infection can spread in the population. Models with bilinear interaction among populations \u00f0xy\u00de tend to disease free equilibrium or endemic equilibrium [7] . Researchers have considered various interactions of non-linear type such as bx p y q [21, 22, 32, 39, 50] , xy 1\u00feax [53] , or xy 1\u00fey [13, 16, 34, [44] [45] [46] 52] for further understanding dynamics of infectious diseases. It is observed that solutions of periodic nature do exist even without periodic forcing term in the model. The existence of periodic solutions are usually attributed to the presence of time delays in the system even in case of bilinear incidence. Delays do exist in disease transmission, known as the latency period of infection, from inception to an identifiable state. For some interesting studies on infectious disease models, readers are referred to [8, 14, 24, 15, 19, 23, 25, 28, 29, 47, 49, 51] . On the other hand, fluctuations in populations may also be attributed to changes in environment, especially, in open systems. These perturbations are influenced by the environment and may be treated as noise in the system. Dynamic models of competing species under the influence of a noise are extensively studied in [6, 9, 30, 48] . Predictive models based on both clinical, incidence data pertaining to infectious diseases and epidemics in general are discussed in [40] [41] [42] .",

The reproduction number represents the number of secondary cases that are caused by a primary case when introduced into a wholly susceptible population. Also, it is observed that if reproduction number is less than unity, the disease free equilibrium is stable, otherwise, the disease prevails [16] . When the nature of interaction is not known or the basic reproduction number is more than unity, one needs to find ways to restrict the disease to a minimum, manageable level, if the disease free environment cannot be provided. When it comes to the control of a disease, vaccination or preventive strategies could be a good choice during the early stages of the disease provided the population is not large enough. Emergence of vaccine resistant strains is one of the drawbacks of frequent or long term vaccination. When massive vaccination is not possible, the second stage of defensive mechanism could be medical treatment. This adds a new sub category of population called recovered class representing the population recovered by treatment.",

The parameter d 1 > 0 is the removal/death rate of the infected population-either not at all treated or inadequately treated or beyond the treatment.

The parameter a > 0 is the rate at which a recovered (non-vaccinated) individual may be re-exposed to infection and become susceptible again. This case arises when the individual appears to be recovered by treatment but is prone to infection again. The basic interactions among various populations are shown in Fig. 1 .",

Influence of time delay s > 0 on the stability of the delay-free system is studied in Section 3.2, while the influence of delay in recovery (d > 0) alone is studied in Section 3.3. Bounds for these delays, conditions for change in the direction of stability are also discussed. In Section 3.4, the general case of delays s > 0 and d > 0 is discussed. In Section 4, global stability results are derived for a special case in which both the delays are present.

Results on global stability are also established for a special case of the proposed model. Situations where the effect of time delays on the stability of the equilibria is null and void are identified in this special case. It is important and interesting to further explore this view point for more general cases. In [2] it is observed that the vaccination threshold rate is admissible, beyond which the infection gets eradicated.

In Example 5.3, it is noticed that the equilibrium \u00f02; 2; 2\u00de is locally stable as long as the time delay in infection s < 4. Thereafter this equilibrium becomes unstable as predicted by the theory (see results in Sections 3 and 4). At the same time, simulations show that for s > 4 the system is behaving very wild and large fluctuations are observed in infected and recovered populations. This situation is more vulnerable than having a stable endemic equilibrium where the situation may not be much beyond control. Thus, existence of a stable endemic equilibrium may sometimes be a better choice. Further, the behavior of the system under the simultaneous influence of time delays (general case, Section 3.4) needs to be investigated in detail. For commensurate delays, study in Section 3.4 may provide an estimate but for other types of delays, more explicit estimates are required. However, we need to analyze such situations further. 2. Most of the mathematical studies on biological models concentrate on the stability of equilibria (known or identifiable solutions) of the system. Consider the following system.",

Also system (29) in Example 5.5 allows no possibility for existence of a disease free equilibrium, and hence, no scope for disease free environment. Comments made in Section 2.1 are aimed at such situations. In such cases, we have to study the ways of controlling the infected populations rather than the stability of the system. This raises the following questions. How to control y? Can we find a small P 0 such that y\u00f0t\u00de 6 for some t P T.

            "text": "We shall now propose some modifications to (1) taking into consideration some realistic phenomena. We present the following cases as open research problems that would form a part of our further research, 1. We have assumed the growth rate of susceptible population a in (1) as a fixed constant. This assumption holds good when the susceptible population receives input from a large society and the disease visits for a limited period during which the reproduction of susceptible, infected and/or recovered population is not significant. However, in case of chronic diseases such as AIDS, Chagas e.t.c., offspring of all three populations may make sizeable contribution to the system. Thus, we may consider,x 0 \u00bc aU\u00f0x; y; z\u00de \u00c0 bf \u00f0x; y\u00de \u00c0 dx \u00c0 cV\u00f0x\u00de \u00fe azhere aU\u00f0x; y; z\u00de denotes the growth function of susceptible population. 2. Vaccination well before an attack by the disease is rare.May be it is possible in a well prepared society? But in most of the cases, vaccine is not readily available and a delay in its preparation or supply is natural. This may be viewed in two directions.(a) Vaccine takes time c > 0 to develop immunity so that susceptible population vaccinated at time t \u00c0 c are immune at time t. Hence, such population may be removed from the system. Thus, we haveNotice that we have taken V\u00f0x\u00f0t\u00de\u00de V\u00f0t \u00c0 c\u00de in (1) for this case.(b) Vaccination effort being carried out at time t depends on a previous estimation of population.That is, we choose V\u00f0x\u00f0t\u00de\u00de \u00bc V\u00f0x\u00f0t \u00c0 g\u00de\u00de in (1). We have x 0 \u00bc a \u00c0 bf \u00f0x; y\u00de \u00c0 dx \u00c0 cV\u00f0x\u00f0t \u00c0 g\u00de\u00de \u00fe az y 0 \u00bc b 1 f x\u00f0t \u00c0 s\u00de; y\u00f0t\u00de \u00f0 \u00de \u00c0 rP\u00f0y\u00de \u00c0 d 1 y z 0 \u00bc rP y\u00f0t \u00c0 d\u00de \u00f0 \u00de\u00c0az:3. Recovered population may take time to become susceptible again. That means, they could retain health for some time, say, l > 0. This may be represented in (1) as,x 0 \u00bc a \u00c0 bf \u00f0x; y\u00de \u00c0 dx \u00c0 cV\u00f0x\u00de \u00fe az\u00f0t \u00c0 l\u00de y 0 \u00bc b 1 f x\u00f0t \u00c0 s\u00de; y\u00f0t\u00de \u00f0 \u00de \u00c0 rP\u00f0y\u00de \u00c0 d 1 y z 0 \u00bc rP y\u00f0t \u00c0 d\u00de \u00f0 \u00de\u00c0az:4. Though mathematical models can describe many plausible realistic phenomena, their usefulness is acceptable only if they stand the test on the real time data. Thus, it would be interesting to test the results of this article with available real time data so that necessary modifications or improvement of (1) may be taken up suitably. 5.
