To develop a simple, rapid, accurate, and high-throughput detection method for diagnosis and differential diagnosis on swine enteric coronaviruses, specific primers and probes were designed based on the highly conserved regions of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) N, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) M, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) M, and porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) N genes respectively. A TaqMan-probe-based multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay was developed and optimized to simultaneously detect these swine enteric coronaviruses. The results showed that the limit of detection can reach as low as 10 copies in singular real-time RT-qPCR assays and 100 copies in multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay, with all correlation coefficients (R 2 ) at above 0.99, and the amplification efficiency at between 90 and 120%. This multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay demonstrated high sensitivity, extreme specificity, and excellent repeatability. The multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay was then employed to detect the swine enteric coronavirus from 354 field diarrheal samples. The results manifested that TGEVand PDCoV were the main pathogens in these samples, accompanied by co-infections. This well-established multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay provided a rapid, efficient, specific, and sensitive tool for detection of swine enteric coronaviruses.",

            "text": "However, molecular diagnostic tools, rather than serological methods, for swine enteric coronaviruses are urgently needed due to their similar and high pathogenicity to suckling piglets, lacking a mature immune system. For swine enteric coronavirus detection, conventional RT-PCR, multiplex RT-qPCR, or pan-coronaviruses RT-PCR methods targeting M, N, S, or polymerase genes were developed in recent years (Hsu et al. 2018; Song et al. 2006) . Additionally, Zhou et al. (2018a) recently reported a specific real-time PCR for the detection of PEAV. To our knowledge, there was no such method that could simultaneously detect and differentiate TGEV, PEDV, PDCoV, and PEAV from the same detection vial. To solve this urgent and important issue, we developed this multiplex real-time RT-qPCR for the detection and differential diagnosis of the swine enteric coronaviruses circulating in pig herds. TaqMan-probe-based real-time qPCR is a rapid, high specificity, high sensitivity, and great reproducibility detection tool for identification of viruses (Chang et al. 2014 ). Among the seven open reading frames (ORFs) and four structural protein genes, S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), N (nucleocapsid) of coronaviruses (Su et al. 2018 ), the M and N genes are highly conserved within the same antigenic group but less homologous between each of these four swine enteric coronaviruses (Yang et al. 2019) . To establish a high-specific multiplex real-time RT-qPCR for the detection and differential diagnosis of swine enteric coronaviruses, primer sets, and TaqMan probes were designed targeting the highly conserved regions of PEDV or PDCoV M genes and TGEV or PEAV N genes, based on bioinformatics analysis of each virus. Our results demonstrated that each primer and probe set can only detect target gene itself and could not bind with any other targets, indicating high specificity.",

Co-infection of swine enteric coronaviruses may cause recombination between co-infected viruses. During 2012 and 2016, some new swine enteric coronaviruses were generated by recombination with PEDV and TGEV and spread across the central Eastern European countries (Akimkin et al. 2016; Belsham et al. 2016; Boniotti et al. 2016) . The recombination might create more virulent enteric virus strains or new viruses, leading to potential outbreaks or pandemics of swine viral diarrhea. Additionally, co-infections may promote the evolution of non-pathogenic enteric viruses into high virulent and pathogenic viruses. A recent example showed the existence of PDCoV in pig herds for many years in China mainland and Hong Kong but without observed clinical symptoms (Pan et al. 2017; Woo et al. 2012) . Unfortunately, this virus caused severe outbreaks in some states of the USA since 2014 (Ma et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2014 ). This virulence change was most probably caused by the previous exposure to PEDV or other co-infected swine enteric viruses. Therefore, swine enteric coronaviruses co-infection may bring risks for the prevention and control of swine diarrhea.",
