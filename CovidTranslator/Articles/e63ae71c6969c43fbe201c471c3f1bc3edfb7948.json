Therefore, antibodies produced in COVID-19 and 3 SARS patients should not be that dissimilar. We evaluated SARS-CoV test assays to detect for 4 the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and tried to determine the timing of appearance of 5 these antibodies by testing serial sera from these patients. Methods: Tests were carried out using 6 ELISA (total antibodies) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIFA) (IgM & IgG) methods on 7 serial sera from patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Cross-reactivity was 8 seen in these two test assays with sera from COVID-19 patients and was detected in 6 out of 7 9 patients from 7 days after onset of symptoms. Five of the patients had detectable antibodies by 10 the 3 rd week into their illness and there was evidence of seroconversion in 4 patients. The IIFA 11 method was marginally more sensitive compared to the ELISA assay, however the IIFA IgM test 12 was not useful in the early phase of the illness with poor sensitivity. Conclusions: Existing 13 diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV can detect antibodies in patients who were diagnosed with 14 COVID-19. These assays maybe be utilized as an interim measure in epidemiological 15 investigations for contact tracing and to determine the extent of community spread of this new 16 emerging virus pending the availability of specific serology tests for SARS-CoV-2.",

In contrast, the accessory proteins that distinguish CoV infections 31 from each other with high variability across the family, allow viruses to adopt to current and 32 novel hosts. 3 In a study which described the difference in amino acid substitutions of different 33 proteins for SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV, it was found that there were no substitutions 34 that occurred in nonstructural protein 7 (nsp7), nsp13, envelop, matrix and accessory proteins p6 35 and 8b. 4 The N protein for SARS-CoV-2 has ~90% similar amino acid identity to the SAR-CoV 36 N protein and hence the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the N protein would likely recognize 37 and bind the SARS-CoV N protein as well. 5 Furthermore, a study by Zhou et al, showed that the 38 .

Although the overall results for the IIFA test may be more sensitive, 101 the IIFA IgM test in the COVID-19 patients was found to be less useful in the detection of acute 102 phase of the illness which is consistent with the findings of a study in SARS-CoV patients where 103 they found a less frequent (43%) and robust (less discriminatory) IgM response. 13 However, this 104 cannot be generalized as different assays will have different performances depending on the type 105 of antigen utilized. In most countries, real-time RT-PCR remains the diagnostic tool of choice in 106 the acute phase of infection given that antibody will take time to develop after the onset of 107 illness.

For SARS-CoV-2, a study by Zhang et al which used an in-88 house IgM and IgG ELISA test, found that 50% of their patients were positive for IgM from 89 samples taken on day 0 of hospital admission which increased to 81% by day 5, whereas positive increased from 81% to 100%. 12 However these rates were based on the number of days 91 from the time of hospital admission rather than from the onset of clinical symptoms, hence the 92 early high proportion of positive antibody results reported is not representative of how soon the 93 IgM and IgG appears after infection in this study. In our current COVID-19 cohort (where sera 94 were available for analysis), 25% (1/4) of the patients had detectable antibodies in the 1 st week of 95 illness, 66.7% (4/6) by the 2 nd week and 100% (5/5) by the 3 rd week of illness. These data are 96 somewhat imprecise due to the limited numbers of patients.
