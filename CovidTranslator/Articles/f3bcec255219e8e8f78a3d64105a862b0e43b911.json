The reliability of N95 respirators in preventing transmission depends on their fit to the wearer. Quantitative fit testing (QNFT) is the gold standard used to determine this fit objectively. The manufacturers of the respirators also recommend performing a self-reported user-seal-check to detect for leakage. This study aims to investigate the capability of the user-seal-check in determining the fit of N95 respirators by investigating the sensitivity and specificity of the user-seal-check compared with QNFT. A prospective and crosssectional research design was used. A total of 204 local Chinese undergraduate nursing students were recruited to test two commonly used respirator models (3M 1860S and 3M 1862). The results of the user-seal-check were compared with the results of the gold standard QNFT using the Condensation Nucleus Counter Fit Tester System. The sensitivity and specificity of the user-seal-check results obtained with the respirators were calculated. The results indicated low sensitivity, accuracy and predictive value of the user-seal-check in determining the fit of the N95 respirators. The user-seal-check was not found to be reliable as a substitute for QNFT. The results also suggested that the user-seal-check may be unreliable for detecting gross leakage. We recommend that QNFT is used to determine the fit of N95 respirators.",

This gap may allow leakage of airborne contaminants into the wearer's breathing zone, leading to ineffective protection. Because of this potentially ineffective protection, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) made fit-testing of N95 respirators compulsory for tuberculosis prevention before 2003. Both the CDC and the WHO recommended that fit testing should be carried out prior to the use of N95 respirators for SARS prevention. 5, 6 Fit testing is now a mandatory measure for frontline staff working in infected areas in Hong Kong. During an epidemic of an airborne transmitted disease, there may be logistic difficulties in performing fit testing for all clinical staff.",

            "text": "According to the protocol from the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), both quantitative fit testing (QNFT) and qualitative fit testing (QLFT) are the recognised methods to determine whether a respirator fits a wearer or not. Nowadays, QNFT rather than QLFT serves as the gold standard in determining the fit. 6e8 QNFT is an assessment of the adequacy of fit by numerically measuring the amount of leakage into the respirator. 8 Using an electronic device, the ratio of specific particles in the air inside and outside the breathing zone when wearing the respirator is measured and this ratio directly reflects the quantity of leakage. By contrast, the QLFT is a pass/fail fit test to assess the adequacy of fit that relies on the individual's response to a test agent such as isoamyl acetate or irritant smoke near the wearer's nose while wearing the respirator. 8 QLFT only measures the presence of leakage or not. QLFT may include bias such as differences in the wearer's sense of smell or uneven and immeasurable concentration of the test agents in the air. 9,10 QNFT is thought to be the more reliable method for fit testing, as reported in worldwide guidelines and research literature. 11e13 N95 respirator manufacturers recommend that the wearer should carry out a user-seal-check. This is a standardised test performed by the wearer to detect gross leakage in a respirator. As suggested by some guidelines, no further QNFT is needed for a given respirator if leakage is detected by the user-seal-check. 8, 14, 15 Furthermore, it has been suggested that a user-seal-check may be used as a substitute for QNFT if QNFT is not yet available. A previous retrospective study reported that the user-seal-check failed because its false-positive and false-negative rates in determining the fit of N95 respirators were too high. 11 There were limitations to this study including the retrospective design, differences in the number of each given models being tested, staff being able to select the respirator for testing and no standardised procedures for donning the respirators. Variations in the donning technique may have affected the reliability of the reported results because the technique of donning has been shown to correlate with leakage. 16, 17 These limitations restrict the reliability of the findings. Therefore, this topic warrants further investigation with a prospective study design.",

This system is based on a miniature, continuous-flow condensation nucleus counter (CNC) which is technology recognised by the OSHA to count air particles ranging from 0.02 to 1.00 mm in diameter. 18 The use of the QNFT device followed the manufacturer's guidelines and the protocol described by the OSHA. 8, 19 Once the wearer has donned the respirator and QNFT system in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines, the wearer performs eight exercises as recommended by the system. Figure 1 shows the fit tester system, tubing connection and respirator. The eight exercises included normal breathing, deep breathing, side-to-side head movement, up-and-down head movement, talking (a standard set of passage was provided for reading), grimacing, bending over, and normal breathing. The grimace was to try and intentionally break the face seal to see if the respirator would reset itself afterward. Table I summarises the exercises and their duration. Each exercise was given a particular individual fit factor (FF; range: 0e200), except that of the grimace task. The overall FF was calculated using an equation in the protocol. This overall FF ranged from 0 to 200 and was the ratio of the concentration of a challenge agent outside the respirator to the concentration of the challenge agent that leaks inside the respirator (C out /C in ). An FF of >100 indicates a 'pass' rating, which means a given respirator is a correct fit for the wearer. 8, 19, 20 The PortaCount respirator fit tester system went through a daily check procedure in order to standardise the performance of machine and system.",

Performing the QNFT with two models of N95 respirators improved the overall pass rate of QNFT to 80%. However, the remaining 20% of the staff will need to be tested on further respirators. To conduct a QNFT on one N95 respirator using the PortaCount respirator QNFT system takes at least 10 min. Therefore, if three respirator brands needed to be tested for a user to find a respirator which fitted, 30 min would be needed. During an epidemic, time constraints may make it difficult to perform the QNFT for all relevant healthcare personnel, so a more rapid, simple alternative test to QNFT would be useful. 16 The userseal-check is a simple, inexpensive, fast and self-manageable test that can be conducted anytime and anywhere. 15 However, findings consistently indicate that this test is unable to serve as an effective alternative to QNFT because of its low sensitivity, accuracy, and predictive value. 8 In some cases, users subjectively reported that the respirator fitted well, but the result of the fit factor was very low, and the overall QNFT subsequently failed. Such an observation suggests that leakage between the face and the respirator is not easily detected by the user.",

A positive predictive value (PPV) estimates the likelihood that a person who finds a leakage through user-seal-check fails QNFT. 25 When applying the recommendation from Straus et al. in the current study, for a userseal-check to be useful at ruling out a leakage it must have high sensitivity, and for it to be useful at confirming a leakage it must have high specificity. 26 The combination of high specificity and high PPV indicates a promising prediction for a user-seal-check to confirm a leakage. 25 However, the current findings of high specificity (89e90%) and low PPV (46e63%) of user-seal-check limit its capability to identify a case with leakage. This is consistent with the findings of Derrick et al. for half-face respirators and Delaney et al. for full-face respirators. 11, 27 Thus the user-seal-check seems to be of limited value in detecting the leakage of facepiece respirators.",
