            "text": "Background/Purpose: Nosocomial outbreak of tuberculosis (TB) is rarely documented and the transmission is usually difficult to confirm because of the long incubation period of the mycobacterial infection. In this report, we demonstrated the use of molecular genotyping methods together with contact tracing to identify the source case, the causative outbreak strain and transmission dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and for the definite confirmation of a suspected outbreak. Methods: M. tuberculosis strains were genotyped with IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism, spacer oligonucleotide typing and minisatellite interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat methods. Clinical data and contact tracing results were collected from medical records and the National TB Registry. Results: In this episode, 66 health care workers (HCWs) were notified as TB cases. A total of 18 M. tuberculosis isolates from HCWs and patients were collected. IS6110 RFLP results revealed that 9 out of 10 HCWs' and 7 out of 8 patients' isolates shared the same genotype. The causative isolate was identified as the Beijing genotype. The index case was a hospitalized respirator-dependent patient. Conclusion: Thorough collection along with molecular diagnosis and genotyping of all M. tuberculosis isolates are recommended for the confirmation of any suspected nosocomial TB outbreak.

            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease with a long incubation period; it can thus cause a nosocomial outbreak which is usually hard to confirm. 1 Nosocomial transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been previously reported to be associated with close contact with unrecognized and/or active TB patients, 2 autopsy, 3 surgery, 4 and medical procedures such as bronchoscopy, 5 endotracheal intubation, respiratory suctioning, aerosol or nebulized treatment and sputum induction. 6, 7 Insufficient environmental control and inadequate administrative measures were also contributing reasons. [8] [9] [10] Since the early 1990s, nosocomial infection of TB among health care workers (HCWs) has drawn much more attention than before and is considered to be an important occupational hazard. 11 During the peak severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) period (April to July, 2003) an outbreak of nosocomial pulmonary infection occurred in a district general hospital in Taipei. The suspected nosocomial outbreak of SARS alert led us to conduct a thorough contact investigation and it turned out to be a TB episode. A part of this episode has briefly been described previously. 12 The outbreak of SARS has further witnessed the importance of nosocomial infection control. 13 A combination of disease surveillance with epidemiologic and laboratory investigation has been successfully applied in several outbreak investigations of nosocomial TB infection. 11 TB remains the leading notifiable infectious disease in Taiwan. 14 The moderate incidence of TB will certainly increase the risk of potential transmission among HCWs in health care facilities. Even though some small clusters of sporadic TB cases have been recognized at schools, health care facilities and other institutions, no major nosocomial outbreak has ever been proven in Taiwan. In this report, we demonstrate the use of molecular genotyping methods together with contact tracing to identify the source case, the causative outbreak strain and transmission dynamics of M. tuberculosis, and for the definite confirmation of a suspected outbreak. It could serve as a standard protocol for any possible nosocomial TB outbreak investigation in the future.",

Another female nurse working in the same ward complained of fever, headache, and chest pain about 3 weeks thereafter. Both HCWs' chest X-rays (CXR) showed abnormality, and they were commenced on anti-TB treatment for TB. Subsequently, contact investigations, using CXR as a primary means to thoroughly screen for B2 B1 1F 2F 3F 4F 5F 6F 7F 8F 9F potential TB infectious cases, were conducted on all nurses, ancillary staff, medical technicians, and any other personnel who worked on the 4 th floor. Tuberculin skin test was not performed because most of them had already received BCG vaccination. The algorithm of decision for the contact investigation was based on the \"stone-in-pond\" theory and a 3-month interval periodic CXR screening for 9 months. 15 A female technician (HCW 2) working in the basement of the hospital was later confirmed to have TB by positive sputum culture for M. tuberculosis. An epidemiologic investigation afterwards revealed close contact (< 2 hours) between the technician and Patient Case 1 (P1) during a bone-scan process. Following this finding, almost the entire 1580-strong hospital staff including all full-time and part-time employees, volunteers and contracted personnel underwent CXR contact investigation for possible exposure. A retrospective review of the clinical data of all patients with past or recent primary TB history ever admitted to the 4 th and other floors between November 2002 and December 2003 was conducted.",

Even though the long incubation period of TB hinders the exact transmission routes, applying molecular methods in the investigation of a nosocomial outbreak could prevail over the difficulty in confirming the transmission and the index case in an area with moderate prevalence of TB. We also observed that short contact with an active TB case during radiologic examination revealed high risk of infection. Furthermore, the identification of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in suspected cases might mislead the investigation and delay the responses to nosocomial infection control.",

First, most of the HCW cases were in their early minimum TB stage with no apparent clinical symptoms and all induced sputum, pleural effusion and biopsy samples resulted in only 10 positive M. tuberculosis cultures for genotyping (Table) . Second, the initial M. tuberculosis isolates of some suspected index patient cases were not available for genotyping. However, M. tuberculosis isolated from family members (P7 and P9) providing bedside care to two suspected index cases (P6 and P8) were later genotyped to be identical to the outbreak strain by RFLP. These results provided some indirect evidence for possible index cases of case P6 and P8 (Table) . Therefore, a national archive of mycobacterial strains was recommended and it would become a sustainable resource in support of evidence-based retrospective investigation of temporal and spatial transmission. Third, the recent isolates of two highly suspected cases P1 and P10 turned out to be NTM rather than M. tuberculosis. They were residents on the 4 th floor without isolation because they were considered cured old TB cases and had previous M. tuberculosis isolated. The complication of NTM might have caused missed or delay in diagnosis of an active TB case and unintentionally result in a nosocomial outbreak.",

Of the 10 HCWs, nine cases were clustered. Eight of them worked on the 4 th floor, and a technician who worked in the basement had casual contact with P1, who was hospitalized in the respiratory care ward (RCW) on the 4 th floor. Among those seven patients (P2, P7, P9, P11, P12, P13, P14) infected with the same strain, two (P7 and P9) were family members of previously hospitalized RCW patients on the 4 th floor (P6 and P8). In addition, P2 was recognized after being transferred to another Taipei municipal hospital and notified as a TB case later. The P2 case, with no TB history and a normal CXR at the time of admission, was hospitalized in the RCW on the 4 th floor in December 2002 and might have been exposed to ward mate P1, whose CXR showed reactivation of pulmonary TB and was admitted since November 2002. Being reported by another hospital in Southern Taiwan, P11 was an outpatient case who visited the clinic on the 1 st floor during the episode. Cultures from his sputum and surgical wound showed positive M. tuberculosis that matched the genotype of the outbreak strain. Since one of the HCWs (HCW 4) working at the outpatient clinic was also infected with the outbreak strain, there might be a second infection source. P12 stayed on the 4 th floor during the outbreak. Two outpatient cases (P13 and P14) infected with the clustered outbreak strain, and with no prior hospitalization and obvious contact history, might have been infected in the community.",

All M. tuberculosis isolates received were subcultured and reconfirmed before further genotyping investigation. Several nosocomial investigations revealed that the frequently observed causative strain was W-Beijing genotype, including the outbreak strain identified in this episode. 22 According to the results of surveillance conducted in 2003, the overall prevalence rate of Beijing family genotypes was 44.4% and 51.6% in Taiwan and Northern Taiwan, respectively. 23 Several studies indicated the unique features of the Beijing strain, including its early but ephemeral immune response, more severe pneumonia, more deaths, poorer BCG vaccination protection in animal models, and frequent association with multidrug resistant TB outbreaks in institutions. 24 Based on the mutation analysis results of genes involved in the repair of DNA (mut genes), the outbreak Beijing strain identified in this episode presumably had increasing adaptation and persistence ability to hosts as suggested. 18 Identical MIRU-VNTR pattern was found in M. tuberculosis strains isolated from Malaysia and China. 25 It is not surprising that Taiwan is geographically and economically closely related to Mainland China, which has a high prevalence rate of the Beijing genotype of M. tuberculosis. 26 Close surveillance of this prevalent strain is necessary to prevent any possible outbreaks in future. Nosocomial transmission of TB has been frequently reported, especially after the observed resurgence of the disease and the increased incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB in the 1990s. 27 The identified outbreak strain has a RFLP pattern different from the MDR W-Beijing strain reported (Figure 3 ). For many cases notified in such a short period of time, we could have been facing a highly virulent and contagious Beijing strain of M. tuberculosis. Fortunately, the causative strain in this outbreak was susceptible to all first-line anti-TB antibiotics.",
