It has greatly expanded our knowledge of life's diversity and accelerated efforts to fill the uncharted chapters of life in various environments such as ocean, soil, sediment, and fresh water, as well as in extreme environments 2,3,5-7 . Nevertheless, despite being widely used to study nearly all the microbial communities from the surface of the Earth, direct metagenomic sequencing of the microbial communities in the air has remained a challenge. This partly resulted from the limited availability of collectable airborne particulate matter (typically in the range of tens to hundreds of milligrams), the low biological content of the samples and incompatibility of traditional DNA extraction with airborne particulate matter collection methods (e.g., the use of quartz filters) 8 . In the past, the majority of the studies on airborne microorganisms were based on 16S rRNA gene-specific amplification and sequencing, which, although contributing tremendously to our understanding of the identity of the airborne microorganisms in various environments [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , has also limited our ability to sample other key microbial genes of the community.",

In this protocol, we have integrated several key modifications into the steps of airborne particulate matter collection, sample pretreatment ( Fig. 1) , DNA extraction and sequencing library preparation. We show that such modifications and optimization have greatly improved the DNA extraction efficiency of airborne particulate matter samples. By using this protocol, one can extract a few nanograms to tens of nanograms of genomic DNA from tens of milligrams of collected particulate matter, which is sufficient for downstream library preparation and high-throughput sequencing. As an example, we have recently applied this protocol to the study of the airborne microbial communities in the city of Beijing, where we extracted the DNA from airborne microbes for metagenomic sequencing, characterized the diverse microbial communities and identified more than 1,300 species of bacteria, fungi and viruses 8 . The availability of a vast number of metagenomic sequences has enabled us to identify inhalable pathogens and allergens at the species level, as well as to study the unique gene sets of the airborne microbial community.",

Our protocol has integrated these existing DNA extraction methods used for treating soil samples with airborne particulate matter collection, sample pretreatment and sequencing library preparation. The apparent advantage of our protocol is that the DNA extraction requires a very small mass of input sample (typically in the range of tens to hundreds of milligrams). This allows one to analyze and obtain many more sequences than the previous studies that typically used 16S rRNA gene or whole-genome amplification to compensate for the low yield of genomic DNA. In conjunction with an optimized DNA library preparation protocol, the extracted genomic DNA can be used directly for high-throughput sequencing, revealing much more information on the microbial community and the genes it comprises. An additional advantage of this optimized protocol is that with high-throughput sequencing one obtains much more sequence information than from the 16S rRNA genes for identifying bacteria, which typically are limited to the genus or family levels; instead, one can pinpoint the specific species of bacteria, fungi and viruses that might be harmful to human health 8 .",

For collecting atmospheric particulate matter samples, locations without major interference sources nearby are recommended. For example, in our previous study 8 , we were interested in the atmospheric airborne microbial community, and hence the PM 2.5 and PM 10 (particulate matter with nominal mean aerodynamic diameters of \u22642.5 and \u226410 \u00b5m, respectively) samples were collected from the rooftop of a two-story building on Tsinghua University campus, a site that has been used to monitor atmospheric air pollution in Beijing since 1999 (refs. 20-22) . Particulate matter can be collected on 20.32 cm \u00d7 25.4 cm Tissuquartz filters that have 99.9% typical aerosol retention efficiency. Sample collection can be conducted by high-volume air samplers with an average air flow rate of 1.13 m 3 /min (Fig. 2a) , the inlets of which have been shown to be effective with wind speeds of up to 24 km/h (ref. 23 ). This results in ~1,559 m 3 of air flow-through per sampling day (typically 23 h, allowing 1 h for changing filters), which is important to ensure a sufficient mass of input sample (typically in the range of tens to hundreds of milligrams) to be collected. In our previous study 8 , we used a total of three high-volume air samplers: two of which were equipped with PM 2.5 fractionating inlets and one with a PM 10 fractionating inlet (Fig. 2b,c) . Weigh each filter before and after sampling (Fig. 2d) , and all samples can be used immediately or stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until the next step.",

Owing to the low mass of collectable particulate matter samples and the DNA-binding properties of silica fibers in the Tissuquartz filter, we designed a series of sample pretreatment steps to optimize the yield of genomic DNA (Fig. 1) . Considering the different mass of input materials from the collected PM 2.5 and PM 10 samples, we typically use one-fourth of a PM 10 filter (~103.04 cm 2 ) and 1.5 or 2 pieces of PM 2.5 filters (collected by two samplers on the same day) for sample pretreatment and subsequent DNA extraction. The filters are cut into four equal-sized pieces (8.96 cm \u00d7 11.5 cm each; Fig. 2e ), which are rolled and inserted into 50-ml Falcon tubes filled with sterilized 1\u00d7 PBS buffer (Fig. 2f) . The particulate matter samples are then pelleted at 4 \u00b0C by low-speed centrifugation at 200g for 3 h. After brief, gentle vortexing, the resuspension is filtered through a 0.2-\u00b5m Supor 200 PES Membrane Disc Filter (Fig. 2g,h) . The above wash and filter recollection (pretreatment) steps are necessary to help separate most of the biological contents from the quartz filters before DNA extraction for improved extraction efficiency. In addition, the pretreatment of particulate matter sample reduces the sample volume needed for DNA extraction, and thus it allows the use of AMPure XP beads for genomic DNA extraction at a reasonable cost. Quantification of the recovered genomic DNA and quantitative PCR (qPCR) results suggested that the extraction efficiency of microbial DNA from particulate matter was optimized by applying the pretreatment step and by using AMPure XP beads compared with other methods ( Table 1 and Fig. 3a) . After the wash and filter recollection, we cut the PES Membrane Disc Filter into small pieces for DNA extraction using commercial kits. All the above steps should be carried out in a decontaminated biosafety cabinet.",

The qPCR data (color-coded and ranked top-down from the lowest C t to the highest), together with the DNA concentration data presented in table 1, suggest that the method of using pretreatment with bead purification provides higher DNA yield than all the other methods tested above. The addition of the pretreatment step improves the yield of DNA extraction, and using beads for DNA purification is more effective than using column. For HiSeq sequencing, each sample can be barcoded (added during library preparation), and equal quantities of barcoded libraries can be multiplexed during sequencing. The use of other alternative high-throughput sequencing platforms is possible, and the manufacturer's instructions on the library preparation and sequencing should be followed. Attention should be paid to the throughput and requirement of input genomic DNA. To appreciate the diversity and to sample a sufficient amount of microbial genes, we recommend generating at least 5-7 Gb of data per sample for the study of complex airborne microbial communities. Methods for data analysis vary greatly, depending on the specific needs of the study [26] [27] [28] , but they typically involve removal of the adapter sequences, low-quality reads and duplicate reads, followed by alignment or assembly of the short reads.

            "text": "The protocol described here enables the extraction of airborne microbial genomic DNA from collected particulate matter for metagenomic sequencing. In our experience, most of the particulate matter samples collected daily in the city of Beijing weigh in the range of tens to hundreds of milligrams, and each sample typically yields 5-50 ng of genomic DNA. By using the improved library preparation protocol described here, this quantity is sufficient for direct library preparation without requiring 16S rRNA gene amplification or whole-genome amplification. So far, we have applied this protocol to the extraction of airborne microbial genomic DNA from a total of 30 particulate matter samples (half of which were PM 2.5 and the other half were PM 10 ). ~90% of these samples yielded genomic DNA of \u22655 ng, were qPCR positive and produced good-quality sequencing libraries (Fig. 3) . We show that although it is possible to extract DNA directly from the collected particulate matter samples by shredding the quartz filter without pretreatment, the extraction efficiency can be affected (table 1, Fig. 3a) , probably owing to the presence of DNA-binding quartz fibers. Moreover, extracting DNA using the MO-BIO PowerMax kit without pretreatment would require the use of >10-fold more AMPure XP beads per sample owing to the larger sample volume, and thus we recommend adding the wash and filter recollection steps for the higher extraction efficiency and lower cost. We also show that the use of AMPure XP beads to replace a column for DNA recovery in the DNA extraction and library preparation steps improves the yield (table 1, Fig. 3a) ; otherwise, higher amounts of input materials would be required for library preparation and metagenomic sequencing.
