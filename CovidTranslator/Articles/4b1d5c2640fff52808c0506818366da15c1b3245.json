While there have been no recent outbreaks of the disease, the threat remains as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) like strains still exist in animal reservoirs. Therefore, the development of a vaccine against SARS is in grave need. Here, we have designed and produced a prototypic SARS vaccine: a self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticle that repetitively displays a SARS B-cell epitope from the C-terminal heptad repeat of the virus' spike protein. Biophysical analyses with circular dichroism, transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering confirmed the computational design showing \u03b1-helcial nanoparticles with sizes of about 25 nm. Immunization experiments with no adjuvants were performed with BALB/c mice. An investigation of the binding properties of the elicited antibodies showed that they were highly conformation specific for the coiled-coil epitope because they specifically recognized the native trimeric conformation of C-terminal heptad repeat region. Consequently, the antisera exhibited neutralization activity in an in vitro infection inhibition assay. We conclude that these peptide nanoparticles represent a promising platform for vaccine design, in particular for diseases that are characterized by neutralizing epitopes with coiled-coil conformation such as SARS-CoV or other enveloped viruses.",

The spike protein is composed of two subunits: S1 and S2 ( Figure  1A) . The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit recognizes the host-cell receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. The S2 subunit is responsible for membrane fusion and has a fusion peptide (FP) sequence followed by two hydrophobic heptad repeat regions or coiled-coils (HRN and HRC) (6) separated by a large interhelical domain or loop, a transmembrane (TM) domain and a cytoplasmic tail ( Figure 1A ). Once the spike protein is bound to the host-cell receptor, a structural switch within the heptad repeat regions of S2 allows the FP and the TM domain to move near each other thus facilitating fusion of viral and cellular membrane, and allowing the nucleocapsid to enter the cell, the structural switch of HRN and HRC is a refolding of their trimeric states (7) to form a six-helix bundle (6) , in which three HRN helices are arranged into a central parallel, triple stranded, \u03b1-helical coiled-coil, and packed on the exterior of this core is an outer layer of three anti-parallel HRC strands (8) .",

(16) reported that although a recombinant, trimeric SARS-CoV S protein vaccine elicited a protective immune response in mice the anti-S antibodies also mediated antibody-dependent enhancement of viral entry into human B cells in vitro. In another study, ferrets vaccinated with SARS-CoV fulllength S protein expressed by a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara grown in BHK21 and Vero E6 cells (17) show enhanced virulence of hepatitis induced by SARS-CoV. Furthermore, the use of a SARS S protein vaccine may lead to enhanced disease and immunopathology instead of protection as seen for feline coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus (18) . Given these concerns, the use of a SARS vaccine strategy in which the full-length S protein is used may not be optimal for humans. Hence, the best approach would probably be to use small S protein epitopes that are major neutralization determinants. The use of the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV spike protein induced highly potent neutralizing antibodies and long-term protective immunity (19, 20) . Furthermore, Tripet et al. (21) showed that antibodies directed to HRC of the S2 domain of SARS-CoV spike protein inhibited SARS-CoV replication in vitro.",

For the SARS-CoV spike protein in its pre-fusogenic state, the HRC region is in an \u03b1-helical trimeric coiled-coil (7) . Therefore, a peptide vaccine that would display HRC in its trimeric coiled-coil conformation would be ideal. This requirement is met by the peptide nanoparticles developed in our laboratory. Raman et al. (22) described the design and production of a peptide that selfassembles into a predicted regular icosahedral nanoparticle of about 16 nm of diameter. The monomeric peptide building block of the nanoparticle consists of a modified pentameric coiledcoil from the cartilage oligomerization matrix protein (COMP) and a de novo designed trimeric coiled-coil (23) . If the trimeric coiled-coil is extended by the HRC1 sequence described in Tripet et al. (residues 1156\u22121178 from the SARS S protein: ASVVNIQKEIDRLNEVAKNLNES), the native coiled-coil conformation of the epitope should be maintained. In the study by Tripet et al. (21) , the HRC1 epitope site was shown to be a more effective inhibitor of viral infectivity compared with another epitope site of HRC. Therefore, in our design the HRC1 region was selected to be in coiled-coil register with the trimer sequence of the nanoparticle.",

With the molecular weight obtained from sedimentation velocity experiments, it is possible to determine the number of monomers that constitute a peptide nanoparticle. Figure  5A displays a plot of the normalized sedimentation coefficient distribution, g(s*). The distributions peak near 29S. Using a calculated frictional ratio of 1.3, this sedimentation coefficient corresponds to nanoparticles with a molecular weight of about 1.4 MDa, that is \u223c110 peptide chains per nanoparticle. Based on this, the largest fraction of the peptide nanoparticle seems to be in between a T = 1 and 3 icosahedral symmetry, models of which are shown in Figure 2B . This would imply that the angle between the pentamer and trimer is on average slightly smaller than shown for a T = 1 symmetry in Figure 2A . If this is the case, then a smaller angle would allow more than 60 monomers to co-assemble into a single nanoparticle. However, it is clear from the g(s*) distributions and the tail of the distribution curve to the higher S values that the sample is not homogeneous but rather contains a mixture of different species, which agrees with the data obtained from DLS and TEM. Similarly, Padilla et al. (34) found different sized species for a designed self-assembling protein cage which they attributed to a certain degree of flexibility or polymorphism in the assembled particles.",

On the other hand, when the plates were coated with the synthetic HRC peptide ( Figure 1C) , which on its own forms an unfolded monomer when bound to ELISA plate, there was little or no binding ( Figure 6E ). The results with trimeric HRC (as in MBP-HRC-GCN4) ( Figure 6D ) and monomeric HRC ( Figure 6E ) indicate that the antibodies produced are conformation-specific which is expected from the nanoparticle design and confirms that this is an optimal platform for the display of conformation-specific epitopes with \u03b1-helical and in particular with coiledcoil conformations. Similarly, in previous experiments with template-based coiled-coil antigens (7) the HRC1 sequence was found to elicit antibodies that were conformation-specific for the trimeric pre-fusogenic state of HRC and were not able to bind to the post-fusion sixhelix bundle state (21) .

This most likely reflects the fact that a considerable fraction of the antibodies are directed against the core of the nanoparticle which is also surface accessible to a substantial degree. Another reason for this could be that the trimeric HRC1 coiled-coils in the peptide nanoparticle contain free C-terminal \u03b1-carboxyl groups which do not exist in MBP-HRC-GCN4 or the native HRC peptide (C \u03b1 -amidated). We have previously shown that ionic interactions at the COOH terminus of a protein are very important in antigenantibody interactions (37) . Thus, antibodies made to the carboxyl termini of HRC1 would not necessarily recognize MBP-HRC-GCN4 or native HRC peptide.",

These four sera had strong binding activity to both trimeric MBP-GCN4-HRC construct and the prefusion state of S protein. The sera from mice immunized by nanoparticles alone were similarly concentrated. Both undiluted and concentrated sera were then tested for their ability to neutralize SARS-CoV virus infectivity. The results are shown in Figure 7 . Sera from mice immunized with HRC1 nanoparticles showed a concentrationdependent neutralization of SARS-CoV infectivity. Sera from mice immunized with nanoparticles alone had no significant neutralization activity.",

In a future experiment to test conformation specificity, we plan to introduce a glycine and proline linker between the de novo trimeric coiled-coil and the HRC1 epitope, which will disrupt the coiledcoil heptad repeat between the two sequences. In such a design, we would expect to observe a loss of conformation specificity in the immune response because of a weaker trimeric coiledcoil in the HRC epitope. We have also engineered the pan-DR T-cell epitope PADRE into the peptide sequence and will test the influence of this known T-helper epitope on the immunogenicity of the nanoparticle constructs. If promising results are obtained, the next steps will then include a challenge of mice with the virus to test whether the animals recover from infection.",

It has the advantages of a peptide-based vaccine in its lack of infectivity, ease of protein expression, purification, high purity and stability. Furthermore, the antibodies against the HRC1 from the SARS spike protein are conformation-specific, recognize the prefusion, trimeric conformation of HRC and have neutralization activity on SARS-CoV. These anti-SARS antibodies were obtained without adjuvants. The immunogenic effect of this system is because of the nanometer size of the particle, repetitive display of the epitope and a good mimicry of the epitope's native conformation. Thus, this self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticle has great potential to be employed in vaccines because of the versatility of the antigen-presenting system and good humoral immune response that can be obtained.
