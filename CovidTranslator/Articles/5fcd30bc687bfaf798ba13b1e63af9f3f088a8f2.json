Using the tenth passage of PRC in L-2 cells, the characteristics of the virus were compared with previous studies of sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) replicated in L-2 cells. Based on light and immunofluorescence microscopic examination of control and inoculated cell cultures, PRC-associated CPE was frequently confined primarily to individual cells, and there were relatively few syncytial giant cells. Maximum titers were recovered at 36 h post inoculation (pi). Infectious virus was demonstrated at pH values :ranging from 6.0 to 9.0 and a pH of 7.5 was determined to produce the highest titers of PRC. The optimum temperature for viral replication was 33 \u00b0C. Up to 15 passages of PRC in L-929 cells failed to produce detectable virus. However, after adaptation in L-2 cells (20th passage), PRC replicated to high titers in L-929 cells. Previously, in vitro studies of rat coronaviruses have been hampered by the lack of an identified continuous cell line to replicate these viruses in the laboratory. L-2 cells represent a readily-available continuous cell line that can support the replication of relatively high titers of PRC.",

In the current literature they are associated with different patterns of disease. PRC is considered to produce a disease primarily of the respiratory tract [2, , while SDAV infections are associated with lesions of the salivary and lacrimal glands [7] , and respiratory tract [13-1. However, the viruses are closely related antigenically [1] . Thus conventional serological techniques do not serve to differentiate between the different rat coronaviral strains. Serological surveys indicate that the incidence of colonies positive for rat coronaviruses in a conventional setting may be over 50% [3, 196 D.H. Percy et al. 8 ]. In the past, the characterization of rat coronaviruses has been hampered by the difficulties in replicating virus other than in primary rat kidney cells [ 1, 9] . Continuous cell lines have now been identified that will support the growth of SDAV [6, 10] , and PRC [5] . In this communication, we report the successful cultivation of PRC in L-2 and L-929 cells, and the results of our studies on the characterization of this coronavirus in L-2 cells.",

For example, in PRCinfected L-2 cells, fewer syncytial cells were evident both in Giemsa-stained preparations and in positive cultures stained by immunofluorescence microscopy. In SDAV-infected L-2 cells, syncytial giant cell formation was an important feature of the virus-associated change [10] . In a comparison of the kinetics of viral replication in PRC and SDAV, with both strains, peak viral titers were reached at 3648 h pi (Fig. 4) [101. Although the optimal pH for viral replication was observed to be 7.5 in both viruses, PRC was shown to replicate to relatively high titers over a wider pH range (pH 7-9) than does SDAV [10] . Optimal temperatures for viral replication were different in the two strains of rat coronavirus. Whereas previous studies revealed that SDAV replicated best at 37\u00b0C [10] , the optimal temperature for the replication of PRC in vitro was 33 \u00b0C. Replication was more than 2 logs lower at 31 \u00b0C, and lower by one log at 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 6 ). This finding is consistent with previous observations that PRC is primarily a disease of the respiratory tract in the naturally-occurring and experimentally-induced disease [2, 9] . The lower optimum temperature for PRC replication in vitro may reflect the ability of the virus to replicate readily at a cooler site in the body, the upper respiratory tract. However, lesions were observed in the salivary and lacrimal glands in Wistar rats inoculated with PRC replicated in L-2 cells at 37 \u00b0C [11] .",

            "text": "Previous in vitro characterization studies of the known rat coronaviruses have been hampered by the lack of a readily available continuous cell line to replicate PRC or SDAV in vitro. The reports of the successful replication of PRC and SDAV in a continuous cell line of rat mammary gland origin, LBC [-5, 6] , represented an important contribution to facilitate the replication of these viruses in the laboratory. However, the LBC cell line is not readily available, and in our laboratory, the L-2 cell line has replicated higher titers of virus than LBC cells. The demonstrated ability of both L-2 and L-929 cells to support the replication of PRC should facilitate additional studies on the characterization of these viruses. L-2 cells are a subline of L-929 cells. This cell line was developed from a primary strain of fibroblasts obtained from an adult mouse of the C3H strain [4] . In a previous karyologic study of several sublines of L-929 cells, there were marked chromosomal variations between individual lines [12] . In addition, there is some evidence that the properties of L-2 cell lines maintained in different laboratories may vary in some respects. F'or example, although the line of L-2 cells used in our studies will readily replicate SDA virus in our facility and in other laboratories, not all L-2 cell lines have proven capable of replicating SDA virus (Smith, A. L., Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, and Holmes, K.V., Uniformed Services, University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, pers. comm.).",

Cell-virus receptor sites may be a critical factor in this adaptation process, but the mechanisms involved in this change are currently unknown. This aspect warrants further investigation. It may be possible to identify specific changes in viral proteins and/or nucleic acid composition of PRC which permits adaptation and subsequent replication in L-929 cells. The identification and characterization of such changes should provide additional information on the adaptation process associated with the replication of certain coronavirus in vitro.",

Virus titers are expressed in TCIDso/1.0 ml or more h post inoculation. Densely-stained cells compatible with cell degeneration were the most consistent finding (Fig. 1). In monolayers with advanced CPE, there was destruction of the cell sheet, with separation of infected cells from the substrate. Following the inoculation of L-929 cells with stock virus, neither CPE nor viral antigen were detected after up to 15 serial passages. In attempts to replicate PRC in L-929 cells after replication in L-2 cells, viral antigen and CPE were not demonstrated following the 14th passage in L-2 cells, but were evident in L-929 cells after the 20th passage in L-2 cells. In Giemsastained L-929 cells infected with PRC with evidence of CPE, there were minimal numbers of syncytial cells, and relatively large numbers of densely-stained cells consistent with cellular degeneration",
