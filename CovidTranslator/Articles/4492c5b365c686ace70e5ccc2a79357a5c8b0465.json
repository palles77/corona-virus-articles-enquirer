            "text": "Medical interventions have dramatically increased over the last century, and in the case of infectious diseases, the discovery and development of antibiotics and antiviral agents have represented a very powerful external selective constraint imposed upon replicating microbes. Hundreds of antiviral agents have been developed since the second half of the 20th century, and viruses can generally find evolutionary pathways to continue replication in their presence. The same is true of antibiotics and replication of bacteria. The belief that bacterial diseases were on their way toward extinction was quite widespread in the middle of the 20th century. Sir M. Burnet wrote in his 1966 textbook: \"And since bacterial infections are, with unimportant exceptions, amenable to treatment with one or other of the new drugs, our real problems are likely to be concerned with virus diseases\" (Burnet, 1966) . In 1932, a prominent Spanish medical doctor, G. Mara\u00f1 on, declared: \"In the year 2000 cancer will be a historical disease. Infections will be almost entirely absent as a cause of mortality.\" (On a personal note, when I joined the University of California, Irvine in 1969, to work as postdoctoral student with R.C. Warner, I attended some biology courses in which the teachers expressed to students that infectious diseases would disappear in a few decades as a consequence of the use of antibiotics and antiviral agents). Predictions in science tend to fail.",

Other external influences, such as vaccination or immunotherapy, particularly using monoclonal antibodies, can also evoke the selection of viral subpopulations capable of replicating in the presence of those components inherent to an immune response. Thus, selective constraints intended to limit RNA virus replication meet with the broad and dynamic repertoire of variants ingrained in quasispecies dynamics. Two space-time levels of the effects of drugs or vaccines are distinguished in coming sections: (i) short-term consequences for the individual in the form of treatment or vaccination failure and (ii) long-term consequences at the population level in the field, or vaccine-driven evolution of the antigenic properties of viruses.",

            "text": "Viral diseases are an important burden for human health and agriculture (Bloom and Lambert, 2003) . Virus evolution, through the basic mechanisms exposed in previous chapters, can influence the two major strategies to combat viral infections: prevention by vaccination and treatment by antiviral inhibitors. For the design of new antiviral vaccines, a critical issue is the diversity displayed in the field by the virus to be controlled. The natural evolution of the virus may result in the circulation of one major antigenic type or the cocirculation of multiple antigenic forms. The vaccine composition (independently of the type of vaccine; see Section 8.3.1) must match the antigenic composition of the virus to be controlled. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) circulates as a single serotype, while foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) circulates as seven serotypes and diverse subtypes, and the antigenic types are unevenly distributed in different geographical locations. A monovalent vaccine made of the prevailing antigenic type of HAV should be sufficient to confer protection, while a multivalent vaccine composed of several types or subtypes is required to confer protection against FMDV, and the antigenic composition of the vaccine should match the circulating viruses in each geographical region. This is why antiFMD vaccines of different compositions are used in different world areas at a given time, and vaccine composition must be periodically updated to maintain its efficacy. Thus, one effect of virus evolution relevant to vaccine design derives from the necessity to prepare a vaccine that mirrors the antigenic composition of the virus to be controlled. In the case of live-attenuated antiviral vaccines, the evolution of the vaccine virus while it replicates in the vaccinee is a risk factor to produce virulent derivatives.",

The number of new cases has decreased as a result of vaccination programs against several viral diseases, including measles or hepatitis B (Bloom and Lambert, 2003) , and substantial progress has been made toward the eradication of poliomyelitis (Chumakov and Kew, 2010; Himman, 2017) .

For some diseases such as human influenza or animal FMD, vaccines are accessible, but they require periodic updating to approximate the antigenic composition of the vaccine to that of the circulating virus (Section 8.2). In the case of influenza virus (IV), a major change in antigenic composition can occur through antigenic shift, in which the virus acquires new hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes by genome segment reassortment (Section 7.4 in Chapter 7), with the first evidence obtained by G. Laver as early as 1971 (for the early history of influenza, its causative virus, and vaccine designs, see Beveridge, 1977; Kilbourne, 1987) . Antigenic variation of viruses, whatever the mechanism might be, can affect vaccine efficacy and in some cases, the extreme rapid intra and interhost evolution of a virus may render an effective vaccine unfeasible at least with the current tools of vaccinology. CD8 \u00fe T cell responses may act soon after infection and promote the selection of escape mutants (Bull et al., 2015) . The difficulties for the control of virus disease derived from the adaptive potential of viruses (Domingo, 1989; Domingo and Holland, 1992; Bailey et al., 2004; Hamelaar et al., 2019) require the judicious application of existing tools and innovative approaches that are still in their infancy.",

Despite social pressure to rapidly obtain a vaccine, for each virus-host system, well-designed experiments are necessary to try to establish the determinants of protection, which is not a simple issue. The discussions in coming paragraphs are focused on the relevance of virus evolution in vaccine efficacy, irrespective of the type of protection afforded by the vaccine. What we term \"protection\" may mean the total absence of replication of the infecting virus (termed \"sterilizing\" immunity) or absence of disease manifestations despite infection and virus replication. As a general initial statement, which is widely accepted by vaccinologists, a vaccine is likely to be effective when it evokes an immune response that is similar to the response elicited by the authentic viral pathogen when it produces disease successfully overcome by the infected organism (Evans and Kaslow, 1997; Bloom and Lambert, 2003) . We refer to this as the basic principle of vaccinology. When infection by an antigenically constant virus produces lifelong immunity (i.e., measles virus infection), a vaccine is likely to evoke longlasting protection. In contrast, if a patient cured of a virus can be reinfected by the same (or a closely related) virus (i.e., hepatitis C virus infection) a vaccinedat least one prepared by standard methodologydis unlikely to evoke protection.",

            "text": "Some points to be considered in the design of antiviral vaccines are listed in Box 8.1. They are intended to minimize the selection of vaccineescape mutants and favor the success of vaccination campaigns. Some of the recommendations deserve further comment. First, a basic knowledge of virus evolutionary dynamics and how it affects virus antigenic stability (or lack of) is essential. The fact that a methodology is available (i.e., vectors that can express large amounts of Based on Domingo and Holland (1992) . 8 . Quasispecies dynamics in disease prevention and control antigens displaying good immunogenicity) does not guarantee vaccine efficacy, and even less if correlates of protection are not understood. The order of efficacy of different vaccine designs proposed in Box 8.1 is justified both by the basic principle of vaccinology and by the mechanisms of selection of antibody (Ab)-and cytotoxic Tcell (CTL)-escape mutants by viruses. Single amino acid substitutions at B-and T-cell epitopes in viral proteins are often sufficient to elude neutralization by the corresponding cognatespecific antibody or to escape recognition by a clonal CTL population. For many viruses, the frequency of monoclonal antibody-escape mutants has been measured in 10 \u00c04 to 10 \u00c06 , even in clonal populations obtained under controlled laboratory conditions and that have undergone a limited number of replication rounds (Section 7.4.2 in Chapter 7). Generation of immune-escape variants can result in lack of vaccine efficacy, contribute to viral persistence (Pircher et al., 1990; Weidt et al., 1995; Ciurea et al., 2000 Ciurea et al., , 2001 Richman et al., 2003; Pawlotsky, 2006) , and provoke vaccination-induced virus evolution (Section 8.3.2). In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), antibody-escape variants are incessantly being produced in vivo to the point that virus replication continues despite the antibody response (Richman et al., 2003; Bailey et al., 2004) . The frequency of selection of mutants that can escape a number (n) of components in which we could hypothetically separate a global immune response is far lower than the frequency of escape to a single (a, b, c, etc.) of the i components of the response. Making a simple mathematical abstraction that is applicable also to antiviral-escape mutants (Section 8.4), the frequency of mutants that escape n components of an immune response is the product of frequencies of escape to each individual component [10 \u00c0a \u00c2 10 \u00c0b \u00c2 10 \u00c0c \u00c2 .",

A virus generally includes multiple antigenic sites and each of them is often composed of several overlapping or nonoverlapping epitopes; in addition, a virus has several T-cell epitopes in different structural and nonstructural proteins, and each epitope displays a different degree of relative dominance. However, the above abstraction reflects the advantage of stimulating the host immune system with a sufficiently broad array of B-and T-cell epitopes to prevent selection of vaccineescape mutants due to a high genetic and phenotypic barrier (compare with the barrier to drug resistance described in Section 8.4.2). Therefore, selection of vaccine-escape viral mutants is more likely with synthetic peptidic vaccines, than with whole virus-attenuated or inactivated vaccines because the latter present a broad epitope repertoire to the immune system. Selection of escape-mutants by peptidic vaccines that evoked partial protection of cattle was documented with FMDV (Taboga et al., 1997; Tami et al., 2003) . The arguments in favor of multiepitopic presentation are also endorsed by a notorious scarcity of licensed peptidic vaccines for viral diseases despite horrendous economic investments (orders of magnitude greater than investments in quasispecies research!). Use of a complex, multiepitopic vaccine, however, need not prevent long-term selection of antigenic virus variants as a result of vaccine usage, an important still largely underexplored topic discussed in Section 8.3.2.",

This new design is based on the conversion of the monopartite FMDV genome into a segmented genome version that dominated the population after extensive high MOI passages (Section 2.12 in Chapter 2 and Section 6.6 in Chapter 6). For the segmented virus version to be able to produce progeny, the two genome classes (which are encapsidated into separate particles) must reach the same cell. Therefore, administration of the segmented virus preparation should lead to an 8.3 Antiviral vaccines and the adaptive potential of viruses immune response akin to that evoked by inactivated viral particles, followed by a self-limiting infection. The vaccine was tested successfully in mice and swine, the authentic host of the parental virus (Rodriguez-Calvo et al., 2010) . Potential concerns with this type of vaccine are that the standard (monopartite) genome can be reconstructed by recombination in the early stages of replication in the animal. A safety level is included in that particular FMD vaccine because of multiple mutations that accumulated during the transition toward genome segmentation, which deviated the genome sequence from the one present in the original swine isolate . Exploration of evolutionary mechanisms that result in altered forms of viruses may open new possibilities for vaccine design.",

In addition, for massive vaccinations in veterinary medicine, damage to the vaccine (during transport, storage, etc.) and improper administration are additional problems.

Consider different cell or tissue compartments in which an antiviral inhibitor reaches different concentrations (exerts different intensity of selection) ( Fig. 8.1 ). In each compartment, there are multiple replication complexes. A mutation conferring resistance to the inhibitor will occur at the same rate in each of them, assuming that the mutation rate is independent of the presence of the inhibitor. However, after its occurrence, the proportion of viral RNAs harboring the mutation will decrease depending on the inhibitor concentration. The time at which the effect of the inhibitor will be manifested depends on the inhibitor target. In the example of Fig. 8 .1 we assume that the concentration of inhibitorresistant mutants will decrease in the replication complexes, reaching resistant mutant frequencies of 10 \u00c03 , 10 \u00c04 , and 10 \u00c05 in compartments 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The frequency of inhibitor-resistant mutants in the entire cell, tissue, or organism at that time will be given by the weighted average of mutation frequencies at the individual compartments.

The basic probability considerations regarding the frequency of occurrence of inhibitor-resistant viral mutants are summarized in Box 8.2.

The diversification of HCV into genotypes 1a and 1b influenced the genetic barrier to resistance to the NS3/4A protease inhibitor telaprevir [formula (20) in Fig. 8 .3]. One of the amino acid substitutions that confer resistance to telaprevir is R155K in NS3. In genotype 1a, the triplet encoding R155 is AGA; therefore, a single nucleotide transition G / A can yield the triplet AAA, which encodes K. In genotype 2b, the triplet encoding R-155 is CGA; therefore, two nucleotide changes (transversion C / A and transition G / A) are required to reach AAA, the triplet encoding K. Reaching the alternative AAG codon for K would require the same or a larger number of mutations (see Section 4.3.1 in Chapter 4 for another example of how the synonymous codon usage can influence an 7) Rimantadine, (a-methyl-1-adamantane methylamine).

Additional drugs currently used in antiviral therapy can be found in the references quoted in the text and in Chapter 9. 8 . Quasispecies dynamics in disease prevention and control evolutionary outcome). The requirement of transitions versus transversions to reach the resistant phenotype will affect the genetic barrier to resistance. Most viral polymerases tend to produce transition mutations more readily than transversions presumably because in the course of RNA elongation it is easier to misincorporate a purine by another purine than by a pyrimidine, and the same for pyrimidine misincorporations (Chapter 2). Mutation preference is one of several factors that determine the frequency of drug-escape mutants. Thus, evolution may diversify viruses to display different genetic barriers to the same drugs. Since in many cases, several independent mutations may confer resistance to the same drug to complicate matters even more, it also has to be considered that the genetic barrier to one inhibitor may be affected by the presence of other inhibitors (Beerenwinkel et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "The phenotypic barrier to drug resistance is equivalent to the fitness cost inflicted upon the virus by the mutations and corresponding amino acid substitution(s) required for resistance [Fitness cost is treated in Chapter 4 (Section 4.6) and in Chapter 7 (Section 7.4.2) in connection with the frequency of monoclonal antibody-or cytotoxic T-cell-escape mutants in viral populations]. When a drug-resistance mutation inflicts a high fitness cost, a likely result is a reversion of the mutation when the virus replicates in the absence of the drug. An alternative outcome is that compensatory mutations are introduced in the genome so that viral fitness increases while maintaining the inhibitor-resistance mutation. The two outcomes are not mutually exclusive and may contribute to the multiple, transient selection pathways observed by the application of deep sequencing to monitor the response of a viral population to specific selective force (Tsibris et al., 2009; Fischer et al., 2010; Cale et al., 2011; Kortenhoeven et al., 2015) (see Section 6.3 in Chapter 6). A high fitness cost may prevent or delay the selection of escape mutants. Sofosbuvir [formula (21) in Fig. 8 .3] is a very effective NS5B (viral polymerase) inhibitor of HCV. Amino acid substitution S282T in NS5B has been associated with sofosbuvir resistance, and the substitution has been detected in patients and in some natural isolates of HCV. In one of several clinical studies on sofosbuvir efficacy, the mutant spectrum composition of HCV genotype 2b in an infected patient treated with the drug was followed by deep sequencing of the virus at baseline (prior to initiation of treatment), in the course of treatment, and posttreatment. The frequency of S282T was 0.05% at baseline, indicating preexistence of resistance mutations despite no exposure of the virus to the drug (Section 8.6). Two days after initiation of sofosbuvir treatment, the level of S282T decreased to 0.03%, and viral breakthrough was detected 4 weeks later when 99.8% of the viral population included S282T. During the posttreatment period, genomes with the wild-type S282 amino acid regained dominance that was attributed to the true reversion of mutant genomes rather than the outgrowth of baseline wild-type genomes (Hedskog et al., 2015) . This result suggests a high phenotypic barrier for sofosbuvir, and that HCV has mechanisms to overcome the barrier. The complexities of virus-host interactions render the elucidation of the pathways exploited by a virus to overcome the phenotypic barrier to a drug a highly empirical endeavor. The hope is that a combination of inhibitors that display a high barrier to resistance may impede escape and drive the virus to extinction (Chapter 9). The mutant swarm barrier to resistance is a consequence of the interfering interactions that operate within quasispecies, and that are described in Chapter 3 (Section 3.8). It is a particular case of interference that can delay or impede the increase of frequency of a resistance mutation (Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2005; Kirkegaard et al., 2016) . The possible contribution of mutant swarms to facilitate or prevent the dominance of drug-resistant mutants in infected patients is still largely unexplored.",

For viruses that replicate in cell culture, it is possible to estimate the minimal viral population size needed to select a drug-resistant mutant which is generally positively correlated with the genetic barrier ( Fig. 8.5 ). In the hypothetical example of the figure, a viral population is composed of inhibitor-sensitive viruses (blue spheres), and a low level of inhibitor-resistant viruses (red spheres). The proportion of inhibitorresistant viruses is given by the mutational pressure (e.g., at a frequency of 10 \u00c04 , which is increased in the picture for clarity). Passage of a small amount of virus (e.g., 10 2 infectious virus in the small circle at the upper part of the figure) will exclude the mutant virus (red spheres) that will be maintained at the basal level dictated by mutational pressure in the course of passages (limited to two in the figure for simplicity). Selection of escape mutants is precluded by the limited population size at each transfer. In contrast, if the population size used for the successive infections is sufficiently large (>10 4 , larger circles at the bottom that surround both sensitive and resistant viruses), the resistant mutant can become FIGURE 8.4 Schematic representation of two experiments to determine the concentration of an inhibitor needed to kill 50% of cells in culture (CC 50 value, left) and the concentration of inhibitor that reduces the viral production to 50% (IC 50 value, right).

See text for pharmacological implications. 8.4 Resistance to antiviral inhibitors gradually dominant and can be isolated for further studies. To give another example, a single amino acid replacement that requires two mutations (the change from CAG to AUG to attain substitution Q151M in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, associated with resistance to multiple antiretroviral nucleosides) will occur at a lower frequency than replacements that require a single mutation. If each of the two mutations reaches a frequency of 2 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 , the expected frequency of the drug-resistant genomes (ignoring fitness effects) will be (2 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 ) \u00c2 (2 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 ) \u00bc 4 \u00c2 10 \u00c08 . Thus, at least 4 \u00c2 10 8 viral genomes must undergo one round of copying (or a lower number of genomes a proportionally higher number of rounds of copying) to approach a good probability to obtain a drug-resistant genome in that viral population. Population size limitation of a drug selection event is a specific example of how random events may intervene in the process of positive selection (compare with Section 3.2 and Fig. 3 .2 in Chapter 3; in that figure, the random event that excludes the positively selected population is conceptually equivalent to the insufficient population size depicted in the upper infection series of Fig. 8 .5).",

            "text": "The phenotypic barrier or fitness cost inflicted by a drug-resistance mutation (Box 8.3) is often estimated empirically from the frequency of the relevant substitution in patients treated with the drug or in cell culture assays. An adequate procedure to quantify the phenotypic barrier to resistance is to determine the fitness of the virus expressing the protein with the wild-type amino acid (the one that confers drug sensitivity) relative to the virus expressing the protein with the substituted amino acid that confers resistance; fitness is measured in the absence and presence of the drug (double assay). This is an extension of the determination of fitness vectors described in Section 5.1.1 of Chapter 5, as depicted in Fig. 8.7 ; the assays are best performed in cell culture, although the use of explants or in vivo assays is also feasible. Two parameters can be calculated: the fitness cost inflicted by the amino acid substitution associated with resistance, in the absence of the drug (reflected in a fitness value f \u00c0 DRUG 1 relative to the wild type), and the selective advantage conferred by the substitution in the presence of the drug (reflected in a fitness value f \u00fe DRUG > 1 relative to the wild type). The lower the value of f \u00c0 DRUG , the higher the fitness cost. We define the selective strength of the resistance mutation as f \u00fe DRUG /f \u00c0 DRUG . For example, if we put arbitrary numbers (unrelated to values shown in ordinate) to the fitness values in the first graph of Fig. 8 .7, FIGURE 8.6 Decreased frequency and fitness of mutant genomes resistant to one, two, or three inhibitors. The genome frequency level decreases by several orders of magnitude when resistance to one inhibitor (red asterisk in the upper mutant spectrum), or two inhibitors (red and green asterisks in the middle-mutant spectrum), or three inhibitors (red, green, and blue asterisk in the bottom mutant spectrum) must occur in the same genome (left part of the figure and numerical values at the center). Increased number of mutations generally implies fitness decrease (right part of the figure) . See text for implications. 8.4 Resistance to antiviral inhibitors f \u00fe DRUG \u00bc 1.4 and f \u00c0 DRUG \u00bc 0.8, we obtain a selective strength of 1.7. For the vectors in the second graph, if f \u00fe DRUG \u00bc 3.6 and f \u00c0 DRUG \u00bc 0.1, the selective strength is 36. High selective strength means an important selective advantage conferred by the amino acid substitution for virus replication in the presence of the drug despite a high fitness cost inflicted by the substitution (compare with Section 4.2 in Chapter 4 for the trade-off and \"no free lunch\" concepts). If the substitution does not entail any fitness cost (f \u00c0 DRUG \u00bc 1), the fitness value in the presence of the drug equals the selective strength. Selective strength can be calculated for a mutation or group of mutations that confer resistance to a drug used at a given concentration in a defined environment [example in (de la Higuera et al., 2017) ]. The limitations of fitness measurements (environment dependence, etc.) described in Section 5.1.2 of Chapter 5 apply here. Since viral genomic sequences may vary in the course of fitness assays, a limited number of passages and triplicate parallel assays are recommended. If a substitution entails a high fitness cost, direct reversion of the substitution or incorporation of compensatory mutations may occur. Nucleotide sequence monitoring in the course of the assay should reinforce the conclusions.",

In this view, drug resistance would have been gradually built as a consequence of coevolution (Section 4.5 of Chapter 4) between virus replicative and gene expression machineries and the \"space\" of chemical compounds that interacted with them. Mechanisms of drug resistance might have had their roots in molecular events repeatedly experienced as viruses evolved in an interactive manner with protocellular and cellular metabolites in our biosphere. Discrimination in favor of small molecule substrates compatible with a flow of genome replication and gene expression and avoidance of perturbing intruders that could alter catalytic activities should have been positively selected.

Virus plasticity favors modification of life cycle parameters for virus survival in the presence of drugs, provided time for the relevant selection events is allowed once the treatment has been implemented.

This occurs with thymidine analog resistance mutation (or TAMs) that are typically selected under treatment with AZT or d4T [formulae (10) and (13) in Fig. 8.3 ].

The effect of drug-resistance mutations on the general catalytic efficiency of a viral enzyme is one of the determinants of the functional barrier to resistance, since it may diminish replicative fitness. When an enzyme activity assay in vitro is available, the effects of specific drug-resistance amino acid substitutions on enzyme activity can be tested, although the observed alteration may not be the only influence on the fitness modification of the corresponding mutant virus. The reason is that most viral proteins (including viral enzymes) are multifunctional, and an enzyme activity assay may not capture the range of influences exerted by the enzyme. Regarding direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents for HCV, the inhibitors that target the HCV polymerase (NS5B) generally display a higher functional barrier to resistance than the protease inhibitors and manifest a broader genotype coverage. Fitness decreases entail reductions in viral load and, consequently, lower probability of viral breakthrough (treatment failure). Nucleotide analogs that bind to conserved residues at or near the active site of the viral polymerase tend to show subtypeindependent antiviral activity. Because amino acid substitutions at or near the active site of viral enzymes are likely to inflict a fitness cost, such substitutions may not preexist in treatment-naive patients (Margeridon-Thermet and Shafer, 2010; Sarrazin and Zeuzem, 2010) . Interestingly, in the case of HIV-1, mutations conferring resistance to RT inhibitors inflict a lower fitness cost than mutations that confer resistance to protease inhibitors (reviewed in Martinez-Picado and Martinez, 2008) . Thus, enzymes that perform similar functions for different viruses may have evolved to display different tolerance to amino acid substitutions.

A few estimates for drug-escape mutants are listed in Table 8 .1; several observations and characterization of escape mutants have not been accompanied by frequency measurements. A point worth emphasizing is that quantification of viruses harboring biologically relevant mutations has been possible because an adequate biological assay is available. An antiviral agent or a neutralizing antibody measures the proportion of infectious viral particles that differ from the majority of the population in the relevant resistance trait. There is no reason to suspect that the viral amino acid residues (that are the target of an inhibitor or an antibody) that are substituted to confer the resistance phenotype are more prone to accept variations than many other amino acids in viral proteins. If we had additional selective agents to probe other viral sites, we expect a similar range of variant amino acids than using inhibitors or antibodies. This quite straightforward prediction is another way to state that there is general agreement in the mutation rates and frequencies for viruses being in the range of 10 \u00c03 to 10 \u00c05 substitutions per nucleotide (s/nt), calculated using a variety of biochemical and genetic methods (Chapter 2).",

Incomplete neutralization with the nonsigmoidal slope in the neutralization curves has been characterized for broadly neutralizing antibodies directed to HIV-1 (McCoy et al., 2015) . This general observation is an added complication to preventive designs that consider administration of neutralizing antibodies either as vaccine additives or in combination with antiviral inhibitors (Section 9.2 in Chapter 9).",

The argument is parallel to that used to justify why mutation rates and frequencies differ due to the fitness effects of mutations (Chapter 2). Another prediction derived from the above considerations is that mutations conferring resistance to antiviral agents are expected to be detected in viral populations never exposed to the relevant drugs. All forms of genetic variation of viruses can contribute to dominance and spread of drugresistant mutants, including the combined effect of mutation, recombination, and genome segment reassortment (Richman, 1996; Neher and Leitner, 2010; Rogers et al., 2015) . The basal level of mutational pressure may be sufficient to provide a detectable proportion of escape mutants without the need for selection by the selective agent.

            "text": "The first demonstration that the baseline mutation level in viral quasispecies can include a detectable level of mutations that confer resistance to inhibitors in the absence of selection by the inhibitors, was obtained by D.D. Ho, I. N ajera, C. L opez-Gal\u00edndez, and their colleagues working with HIV-1 (Mohri et al., 1993; N ajera et al., 1994 , 1995 . One of the studies examined the pol gene of 60 HIV-1 genomes obtained directly from lymphocytes of infected patients. Mutation frequencies for independent viral isolates were in Eggers and Tamm (1965) Amantadine and rimantadine IV 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 to 4 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 Measurements in cell culture Appleyard (1977) , Lubeck et al. (1978) Rimantadine a IV 27% Percentage of children treated with rimantadine that shed resistant IV Belshe et al. (1988) Disoxaril a HRV14 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 to 4 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 Low-level resistance in cell culture Heinz et al. (1989) 4 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 High-level resistance in cell culture Guanidine d PV 1.8 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 to 4 \u00c2 10 \u00c08 Measurements in cell culture Pincus and Wimmer (1986) a The formula of these drugs is included in Figure 8 .2 with the following number in parenthesis: amantadine (6); rimantadine (7); disoxaril (2) the range of 1.6.10 \u00c02 to 3.4.10 \u00c02 s/nt, while for mutant spectrum components of individual isolates the values were 3.6.10 \u00c03 to 1.1.10 \u00c02 s/nt. In the virus from these patients, mutation frequencies at the codons for amino acids involved in antiretroviral resistance were very similar to the average mutation frequency for the entire pol gene. Consistently with the mutation frequency values, several mutations that led to amino acid substitutions that conferred resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were identified in patients not subjected to therapy. At the time of the study, the number of antiretroviral agents was still limited, and a considerable number of patients were not treated. The authors gave convincing epidemiological arguments that the background of mutations related to antiretroviral resistance was a consequence of high mutation rates and quasispecies dynamics, and not due to the transmission of resistant virus from individuals that had been subjected to therapy (primary resistance) (N ajera et al., 1995) . The presence of inhibitor-resistance mutations in viral populations never exposed to the corresponding inhibitor has been confirmed for HIV-1 and for several other viruses, including HCV, and it is supported by the calculated mutant frequencies in viral quasispecies (Havlir et al., 1996; Lech et al., 1996; Ribeiro et al., 1998; Ribeiro and Bonhoeffer, 2000; Cubero et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2008; Toni et al., 2009; Tsibris et al., 2009; Peres-da-Silva et al., 2017) . Ample support has also come from deep sequencing analyses of mutant spectra, opening a point of debate on the basal frequency of inhibitor-resistance mutations that constitutes an indication to avoid the use of the corresponding inhibitors in therapy. At least in the case of HCV (and probably applicable to other viruses), there is no basis to suggest that the presence of a drug resistance mutation below a certain level in a patient will not have relevance for treatment failure when the inhibitor is administered. The understanding of quasispecies dynamics cautions against such reductionist arguments as evidenced by clinical cases (Perales et al., 2018) . The data underline the relevance of mutant spectra as phenotypic reservoirs to confront selective constraints before constraints are in operation. For treatments, including a drug that has already been administered to a patient in the past, the influence of quasispecies memory should also be considered (Section 5.5.1 in Chapter 5). Mutant spectra can be viewed as an anticipatory reservoir of phenotypes.",

Natural HCV isolates differ in IFN-a sensitivity, and the molecular basis of the difference is largely unknown. The study in cell culture consisted in subjecting a clonal population of HCV (termed HCVp0, prepared by electroporation of hepatoma cells with RNA encoding the viral genome, transcribed from a plasmid) to 100 serial passages (of the type described in Section 6.1 of Chapter 6) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of IFN-a added to the culture medium. Several mutations scattered throughout the HCV genome were associated with IFN-a resistance (Perales et al., 2013) . The selection of multiple alternative mutations is most likely influenced by the fact that IFN-a evokes a multicomponent antiviral response, which is not focused toward a single viral protein (Perales et al., 2014) . Unexpectedly, even the control HCV populations (those passaged 100 times in the absence of IFN-a) displayed a partial (but statistically significant) resistance to IFN-a that could not be attributed to endogenous IFN production by the hepatoma cells (Perales et al., 2013) .",

HCVp45 and HCVp100 displayed significantly increased resistance to all inhibitors tested, as compared with the parental population HCVp0 Gallego et al., 2016) (Fig. 8.8) . Passage of HCV entailed a 2-to 3-fold increase of viral fitness and a broadening of the mutant spectrum that might have increased the frequency of mutations associated with drug resistance, thus explaining the behavior of the multiply passaged HCV populations. The search for the resistant mutations was easier for telaprevir, daclatasvir, and cyclosporin A than for the other drugs because amino acid substitutions in the target protein had been previously identified as responsible for drug resistance. (In the case of cyclosporin A resistance, substitutions map in NS5A and NS5B, because the drug binds to cyclophilin A, which in turn interacts with NS5A). Analysis of the mutant spectra of HCVp45 and HCVp100 by molecular cloning and Sanger sequencing and by deep sequencing failed to identify specific drugresistance mutations. Since it could not be excluded that the broadening of the mutant spectrum might have increased the frequency of resistance mutations still to be characterized, two additional tests were performed. One was to determine the kinetics of viral production over a 1000-fold range of MOI in the absence and presence of telaprevir. Both the unpassaged and multiply passaged HCV displayed parallel kinetics at the different MOIs, which excludes that drug resistance was due to the presence of resistance mutations in minority components of the mutant spectrum ( Fig. 8.8 ). To further substantiate the findings, biological clones obtained by end-point dilution of the corresponding HCVp0 and HCVp100 populations were tested regarding drug resistance. A biological clone should have eliminated the minority genomes that harbored drug-resistance mutations since biological cloning is the most severe form of bottleneck event (Sections 6.2 and 6.5 in Chapter 6). The biological clones did not display any decrease in drug resistance as compared 8. Quasispecies dynamics in disease prevention and control Moreno, E., Gallego, I., Pineiro, D., et al., 2014 .

Both mechanisms may act conjointly during viral infections in vivo. Some studies with HCV have documented drugresistance phenotypes in infected patients, in the absence of specific drug-resistance mutations (Sullivan et al., 2013; Svarovskaia et al., 2014; Sato et al., 2015; Stross et al., 2016; Di Maio et al., 2017; Dietz et al., 2018) . In fact, prolonged chronic HCV infections represent an adequate scenario for fitness increase due to extended rounds of infections in the same host liver. As a consequence, chronic infections may be prone to display fitness-associated multidrug-resistance phenotypes in the absence of drug-resistance mutations. The multiple mechanisms of drug resistance related to quasispecies dynamics justify even further the need for new antiviral strategies, as presented in Chapter 9.",

For HIV-1 and other lentiviruses, efficient early control of virus replication by the host immune response is generally associated with limited disease severity. The viral load that follows after the initial immune response to HIV-1 is referred to as the \"viral set point.\" In the absence of early therapy, low set points in HIV-1 are generally attributed to a strong cellular immune response, likely influenced by additional host and viral factors. [This and other aspects of HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis have been reviewed in excellent monographs by Levy (2007 Levy ( , 2015 ]. A low set point predicts an asymptomatic outcome, and this is generally the case for viruses that establish persistent rather than acute infections. High viral fitness during the early stages of viral replication can promote disease manifestations. This was suggested by the progression toward the disease of a cohort of individuals that were infected during blood transfusion with an HIV-1 containing a large deletion in Nef, an adaptor protein that mediates replication and pathogenesis (reviewed in Arien and Verhasselt, 2008) . After more than 15 years, some of the infected individuals showed clinical signs, probably as a result of the accumulation of mutations in the HIV-1 genome that compensated for the lack of Nef. More generally, fitness-decreasing (but not lethal) genetic lesions in a viral genome may be compensated by additional genomic mutations that become increasingly dominant in the course of further viral replication. The kinetics of fitness gain will depend on the nature of the lesion and the functional implications of the altered protein or genomic regulatory region (Chapter 5).",

Quasispecies dynamics in disease prevention and control affect disease progression (Domingo et al., 2012) ( Fig. 8.9 ). Fitness gain will be more effective with a high load of actively replicating virus in the infected organism. Elevated replicative capacity and fitness sustain high viral loads. The reason for this basic feature of viral population dynamics is that given a basal mutation rate, a large number of replicating genomes entails a correspondingly higher probability that a required mutation for fitness gain can be produced. The events involved are a specific case of search for adaptive mutations in terms of exploration of sequence space, as discussed in Section 3.7 of Chapter 3. While active viral replication, high load, and high fitness favor progression of the infection and disease manifestations, the fourth parameter included in the large arrow of Fig. 8 .9, mutant spectrum diversity, has an optimal range. Too low or too high intrapopulation diversity is detrimental to virus adaptability. Insufficient diversity limits adaptability to complex environments (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005; Vignuzzi et al., 2006) , while excess diversity may lead the virus to cross an extinction threshold, and this is the basis of lethal mutagenesis as an antiviral therapy (Chapter 9). An additional implication of the parameters shown in Fig. 8 .9 for antiviral interventions is that fitness decrease is recognized as an alternative to inhibition of viral replication to control viral infections[ (Clementi, 2008; Clementi and Lazzarin, 2010) ; reviewed in (Domingo et al. 2012) ]. Thus, key features of quasispecies dynamics have a direct implication on the management of viral infections.",

One of the most na \u20ac ive manifestations of trust in biotechnology in the middle of the 20th century was the belief that a catalog of plasmids encoding the antigenic proteins of the circulating types of pathogenic viruses would suffice to prepare the required vaccine as needed. Concerning influenza vaccines, W.I. Beveridge wrote the following: \"The first objective would be to capture the full range of influenza A subtypes. Their antigens would be studied by specialists at central laboratories and made available for the preparation of particular vaccines if and when required. It might be feasible to stockpile some vaccine against all the principal hemagglutinin antigens to be used in a FIGURE 8.9 A schematic representation of interconnected parameters of viral replication that often relate to disease progression.

See text for justification and references and Chapter 9 for new antiviral strategies that follow the concept expressed in this figure. 8.9 Limitations of simplified reagents and small molecules as antiviral agents fire brigade type of action as soon as an incipient pandemic is spotted\" (Beveridge, 1977) . Naivety is also perceived in current designs of universal vaccines based on conserved antigens, considering the different escape mechanisms that operate in viruses to elude neutralization by antibodies (Chai et al., 2016) . It is remarkable how our present understanding of viral populations renders obsolete the views expressed in the W.I. Beveridge book, and in other writings at the boom of implementation of DNA recombinant techniques. Yet, attempts to produce vaccines against highly variable viruses, based on antigenic structures or some viral isolates, are ongoing (Christiansen et al., 2018) . A critical issue is if the host immune response against a vaccine engineered with \"universal\" (conserved) antigenic motifs will be sufficient to prevent disease upon infection by other forms of the same pathogen (Freeman and Cox, 2016) . From our current knowledge of viral population dynamics, it seems unlikely but time will tell, since efforts toward the manufacturing of universal antiviral vaccines are under way.",

It is unlikely that when used in isolation, they can be converted into useful antiviral therapies because resistant mutants are likely to be selected. Yet, they could be part of combinations with other antiviral inhibitors to provide a larger antiviral barrier (Chapter 9). A similar fate is likely for interfering RNAs (Boden et al., 2003; Gitlin et al., 2005; Herrera-Carrillo and Berkhout, 2015; McDonagh et al., 2015) . To a large extent, the failures of defined chemical entities (oligonucleotides, ribozymes, small molecule inhibitors, etc.) to control virus replication and spread are a consequence of their targeting a very defined viral genomic sequence combined with the adaptability of viral populations. Combination of such multiple elements have been envisaged and tested, but off-target effects and the adaptive potential of viruses are likely to limit their efficacy. Unfortunately, biotechnological developments that have been so positive for many research areas and practical applications tend to simplify the types of agents to prevent disease or inhibit virus replication, ignoring the inherent complexity of the object to be controlled. Success is unlikely when \"complexity\" is combated with \"simplicity.\" An increased understanding of viral population dynamics over the last decades has changed the picture dramatically by providing an interpretation of \"virus escape\" as a general and largely unavoidable phenomenon. Such awareness has pushed the development of new antiviral designs, which are fundamentally centered in two strategies: a combination of multiple, independently acting elements or fitness decrease through excess mutations (Chapter 9).",

This pronouncement fits our current understanding of viral populations. Following Ehrlich, the full implications of quasispecies-mediated adaptation of viruses for 8. Quasispecies dynamics in disease prevention and control antiviral therapy were expressed by D.D. Ho in an influential article entitled \"Time to hit HIV, early and hard\" (Ho, 1995) . The article title captures what is needed to prevent adaptation of a virus in the infected host. Any opportunity to replicate is exploited by the virus to increase its fitness and to become less vulnerable to internal (intrahost) or external interventions such as antiviral therapy. Treatment interruptions during chronic infections, such as \"drug holidays\" that in the case of HIV-1-infected patients were justified to alleviate side effects associated with administration of antiretroviral agents, provided an opportunity for the virus to gain fitness. In principle, given our current understanding of viral quasispecies dynamics, the proposal of P. Ehrlich and D.D. Ho is applicable to other viral pathogens.",

In cases in which such nonprogression can be anticipated by viral and host parameters, it may be justified to exclude some patients from aggressive interventions (Suthar and Harries, 2015; Casado et al., 2018) . As a general rule, however, the potential benefits of early treatment are obvious not only to avoid disease on an individual basis, but also to diminish the chances of virus transmission (reviewed in Suthar and Harries, 2015;  see also Sections 7.1 and 7.7 in Chapter 7 regarding the relevance of viral population numbers in transmission).

A common way to proceed is to test a new vaccine with an animal host, be it the authentic host or an animal model, and obtain full protection when the animal is challenged with a virus that matches the antigenic composition of the vaccine. Following the initial excitement, very often the vaccine displays only partial protection when tested in the natural environment.
