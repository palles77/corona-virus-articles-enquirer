Similar control measures were extended to the entire province of Hubei by Jan 26, 2020. 3 Non-pharmaceutical physical distancing inter ventions, such as extended school closures and workplace distancing, were introduced to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. 4 Within the city, schools remained closed, Lunar New Year holidays were extended so that people stayed away from their workplaces, and the local government promoted physical distancing and encouraged residents to avoid crowded places. These measures greatly changed age-specific mixing patterns within the population in previous outbreak response efforts for other respiratory infectious diseases. 5, 6 Although travel restrictions undoubtedly had a role in reducing exportations of infections outside Wuhan and delayed the onset of outbreaks in other regions, 7, 8 changes in mixing patterns affected the trajectory of the outbreak within Wuhan itself.

Under the context of a large-scale ongoing outbreak, contact patterns would drastically shift from their baseline conditions. In the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, physical distancing measures, including but not limited to school and workplace closures and health promotions that encourage the general public to avoid crowded places, are designed to drastically shift social mixing patterns and are often used in epidemic settings. 4 Although contact patterns can be inferred from reported social contact data that include information on which setting the contact took place in, such studies are often focused on high-income countries, 11 or particular highdensity areas. 12 This limitation can be addressed by quantifying contact patterns in the home, school, work, and other locations across a range of countries based on available information from household-level data and local population demographic structures. 13 To examine how these changes in population mixing have affected the outbreak progression, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and reduction in mixing in the general community.

[27] [28] [29] [30] [31] In our model, we incorporated changes to age-specific and location-specific social mixing patterns to estimate the effects of location-specific physical distancing interventions in curtailing the spread of the outbreak. The measures put in place to reduce contacts at schools and workplaces are helping control the outbreak by providing the health-care system with the time and opportunity to expand and respond. Consequently, if these restrictions are lifted prematurely, while there are still enough susceptible people to keep the R e >1 once contacts increase, the number of infections would increase. Realistically, interventions are lifted slowly, partly as an attempt to avoid a sharp increase in infection, but also for logistical and practical reasons. Therefore, we simulated lifting the interventions in a staggered fashion. Evidence of the effects of various physical dis tancing measures on containing the outbreak are scarce and little is known about the behavioural changes of individuals over time, either during an outbreak or otherwise. Therefore, to model the effects of the physical distancing measures implemented in Wuhan, we assumed the effect that certain types of physical distancing have on age-specific and location-specific contact rates.",

            "text": "This study describes a mathematical model that quantifies the potential impacts of physical distancing policies, relying on Wuhan as a case study. Epidemiological investigations during the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 found many infections clustered around households. 34 Extreme physical distancing measures, including school closures, workplace closures, and avoidance of any public gatherings all at once can push the transmission to households, leading to increased clustering of household cases. 5 As households are not explicitly included in the model, we did not consider heterogeneity and clustering of household transmission. Distinguishing between repeated and new contacts is important for disease propagation in contact network models; 35,36 more sophisticated methods that account for temporal presence within the household 37 would be needed to characterise higher degrees of contact. Looking at limitations of our study, our compartmental model does not capture individual-level heterogeneity in contacts, which could be important in super-spreading events, particularly early in an epidemic. Combined with nosocomial infections, the risk of COVID-19 infection is potentially amplified with close contact between confirmed cases and health-care workers. However, the compartmental model we present is not equipped to explicitly consider transmission within health-care institutions and households. More complex models, such as individual-based models with familial and health-care structures, should be explored. No socomial infection risk among health-care workers and patients has been identified as a research gap to be prioritised in the next few months by WHO.",

            "text": "A key parameter is the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), which determines how fast SARS-CoV-2 can spread through the population during the early stages of the outbreak. This is an inherently difficult parameter to estimate, since the true number of cases that can transmit infection at a given time is unknown (reported cases are likely to be just a small fraction of true cases) and probably varies over time (because of different interventions being introduced and population behaviour changing in response to the epidemic). In our analysis, we used an existing model that inferred time-dependent R e based on the growth of reported cases in Wuhan and the number of exported cases outside China originating from Wuhan. 14 We acknowledge that the underlying reproduction number in Wuhan could have been larger than that used in our study. However, other studies of early SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Wuhan, using different methods, arrived at the same estimate with similar ranges. 1, 9 Although the precise effects of interventions might vary by country and different estimates of key parameters, our model highlights the usefulness of physical distancing interventions and the need to carefully calibrate their lifting to avoid second and subsequent waves of a COVID-19 epidemic. Areas of China outside Hubei and other east or southeast Asian regions have managed to avert a major outbreak locally and delayed the peak of the epidemic, without resorting to Hubei's extreme measures. 38 Policy makers are advised to reapportion their resources to focus on mitigating the effects of potentially soon-to-be overwhelmed health systems. 39 Non-physical distancing factors play a part in mitigating potential spikes in cases, especially when physical distancing measures are relaxed. The effects of seasonality on SARS-CoV-2 are difficult to predict without long time series; supporting evidence for the link between climate and COVID-19 has been largely anecdotal and based on spread in different settings and such analyses are subject to confounding. 40, 41 Consequently, we have not incorporated climatic factors into our mathematical model. Future research should be directed towards understanding the potential seasonality of COVID-19 and the climatic factors that could affect its transmission dynamics. Other innovations, such as the rapid expansion of hospital capacity and testing capabilities, would shorten diagnostic and health system delays, 3, 38, 39 thus reducing effective interactions between infectious and susceptible individuals and interrupting transmission. Effective vaccines 42 and antivirals 43 that are being developed could counteract this global public health threat. The extent to which these strategies can detect cases earlier and isolate infectious individuals from the susceptible pool or protect against infection is less well-understood, hence nece ssitating further evaluation.",

It is difficult to quantify whether physical distancing alone is responsible for the drop in cases, especially during the ongoing epidemic. Therefore, we took a broad view of this question, making assumptions about the results of certain forms of physical distancing and measuring the effects somewhat qualitatively. However, to some extent, physical distancing has resulted in both a shorter epidemic and a lower peak. Given what is known about the transmissibility and (the relatively long 5-6 days) incubation period of COVID-19, 1,16 the efficacy of physical distancing in reducing these important attributes of any epidemic are no surprise.",
