            "text": "Over the past two decades, China has been undergoing a process of economic reform and has been relatively successful. The healthcare system, which had been reformed to suit the market economy, 5 faced multiple challenges: limited financial support from governments; high rates of catastrophic out-of-pocket spending and impoverishment through health expenses; inequalities in health and healthcare utilization; and limited financial protection even among those with insurance (a small minority of the population). 6 Due to the above challenges, the old 'three-tiered' hospital system, which involved local neighbourhood hospitals, district-wide secondary hospitals and city-wide tertiary hospitals, was forced to rely on the sales of new drugs and technologies to boost income, which resulted in expensive and inefficient care and strained patientedoctor relationships. 7 The old public health system was the responsibility of dozens of disparate institutes, centres, agencies, bureaus and departments, which resulted in overlapping and sometimes conflicting mission statements and agency mandates. 8 With an increase in life expectancy, increased burden due to chronic diseases, and the challenges of emerging infectious diseases (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003), the Chinese Government re-examined the public health infrastructure and saw the need for a new public health system to address the many health issues associated with these changes. 5 To minimize overlapping of functions and to increase efficiency, the Chinese Government consolidated existing institutions into a new agency: the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The goal of the CDC is to provide a central public health organization with responsibility for both community and individual health needs. The development of the CDC strengthened the Government's role in public health. 5 As public health and primary care share the common goal of improving the overall health of specific populations, it was decided to integrate the two systems by strengthening public health functions in primary healthcare settings. This approach could improve local public health surveillance and reinforce disease prevention and health promotion. 9 In order to resolve the problems of the increasing burden of healthcare expenses and limited access to health services, the Chinese Government initiated its CHS programme in 1997. 4 The 'threetiered' hospital system was replaced by the current 'twotiered' CHS centre system. The new system consists of ambulatory care in CHS centres and inpatient care in referral hospitals. 7 The main roles of the CHS centres are to provide high-quality, affordable, accessible primary health care and public health services to community residents.",

The six aspects consist of basic clinical services, prevention, health education, women and children's care, elderly care, immunizations and physical rehabilitation. 7 The centres integrate Western and traditional Chinese medicine. In the population-based public health services, there is collaboration between the community health centres and the local CDC. 7 Local governments are the main sources of funding for the local CDC and CHS centres. The core providers in the CHS centres are general practitioners (family doctors), 10, 11 public health specialists and community nurses. These practitioners are responsible for the provision of basic clinical services and for maintaining the wellness of the residents, of all ages, in their communities. 4 In China, a general practitioner is a medical practitioner with recognized general training, experience and skills, who provides and co-ordinates comprehensive medical care for individuals, families and communities. 10, 11 Two models are currently being used to train general practitioners in China. The first model is a 3-year general practice postgraduate residency training programme. The second model of education involves retraining the majority of the less-educated doctors currently working in local community health centres, and transforming them into general practitioners. Completion certificates are awarded by different organizations, including the Central Ministry of Health, provincial ministries of health and city-level health bureaus. 10, 11 General practitioners typically work in the clinics of CHS organizations. When delivering population-based public health services, general practitioners often work in teams with public health specialists, community nurses and other providers. 10, 11 In 2007, in order to implement the CHS more effectively, Beijing Management Centre for Community Health Services (MCCHS) was established. It is affiliated administratively with Beijing Municipal Health Bureau. Similarly, a district office of the MCCHS is attached to each of the city's 18 district health bureaus. 12 The main responsibilities of Beijing MCCHS include writing regulations, establishing assessment standards, and organizing practices for the CHS while, at the same time, supervising the work of the district MCCHSs. The district MCCHSs are responsible for planning, managing and assessing the work performed by all CHS organizations in their respective districts. Each director of a district MCCHS must be familiar with the activities of the CHS in his/her district. 12 Fifteen types of free basic public health services have been delivered by the CHS in Beijing since 2006 13 (Appendix 1). To date, no research has investigated the implementation of these services in Beijing. Due to an interest in understanding the status of and barriers to basic public health services in the Beijing communities, the authors chose to design a study that would investigate the conceptual frameworks of these services. To that end, all 18 MCCHS district directors were approached in order to ascertain their opinions of the quality of the delivery of basic public health services by providers in the CHS.",

However, the delivery of some of these basic public health services was at lower levels of quality than is desirable. This finding is consistent with the reports of other researchers about preventive services delivery in other countries. 16, 21 In general, locally tailored interventions are more likely to be adopted into the usual routines of practice than interventional approaches that are dependent on outside stimuli (such as financial incentives), 22 or which impose practice tools and approaches developed elsewhere. 23 It is imperative to undertake more research to find ways to make these improvements. 24 According to a 2009 policy statement, 3 the Chinese Government and local governments at all levels will provide financial outlays that are not less than \u00a31.43 per person per year for basic public health services for all Chinese people in 2009, and increase subsidies to achieve universal insurance coverage and to assure every citizen equal access to affordable basic health care. 25 year. The budget in Beijing is \u00a32.38 per person per year since 2008; however, Beijing CHS centres are required to deliver more basic public health services than their counterparts in other provinces. The deficiency in funding has become such a problem that some basic public health services cannot be implemented effectively in Beijing. The Municipal Government is now assessing how much money should be devoted to basic public health services on the basis of its funding capability and the demands of stakeholders. In addition, migrants need to be recognized as a specific target group for health promotion, prevention and health care, 27 and the governments should provide additional funding for them.",

            "text": "These findings are consistent with research 28 which points out that multidisciplinary practice teams are key to delivering basic public health services in community settings. Successful teams are created through formulating inter-related goals, identifying measurable outcomes, systematizing routine tasks of care, defining provider tasks and roles explicitly, and providing appropriate training. 27 A document published by the State Council of China in 2006 29 mandated that the allocation rate for medical staff working in the CHS should reach the level of two to three general practitioners and nurses per 10,000 residents, and one public health specialist per 10,000 residents by 2010. In Beijing, the allocation is one general practitioner per 3000 residents, one nurse per 25,000 residents and one public health specialist per 2000 residents. 20 In fact, the above allocation rates have not yet been met, especially since the demand for much of the scope and quality of public health services has increased. In addition, the low levels of CHS providers' knowledge and skills 4 is a major problem. As a result, basic public health services are often only provided in response to patient requests or obvious needs in Beijing; services thus tend to be reactive rather than proactive. It may simply be unrealistic to expect community providers to deliver a comprehensive package of basic public health services along with the many competing demands of providing direct clinical care. 21 In view of the reasons mentioned above, Beijing Municipal Government is planning several programmes to improve the service capabilities of the CHS providers. These include partial changes in the structure, roles and functions of the teams; incentives to attract more medical graduates to work in community settings; redistribution of tertiary hospital doctors to CHS organizations; reemployment of retired doctors in the CHS; and the provision of financial support and opportunities for younger doctors to get better continuing medical education. 4 The roles and experiences of both medical staff and their patients also impact on health promotion activities. The community resident/patient is not a passive participant in the process of receiving basic public health services, and many residents look to providers for guidance and direction in the prevention of diseases. 30 Favourable interaction between providers and patients is critical to the effectiveness and efficiency of the delivery of basic public health services, because in some types of preventive services, the patient's contribution may ultimately be more significant than the provider's role (e.g. weight loss, smoking cessation, reduction of alcohol use, adherence to medical regimen). 30 People with insurance can access other services which are not free of charge in CHS organizations. In fact, people with insurance prefer to visit doctors in hospitals to CHS organizations. In order to attract more people to visit the CHS, CHS organizations are required to supply acceptable services by decreasing drug prices and increasing the proportion of medical reimbursement. 31 Beijing Municipal Government is currently devoting significant funding to publicizing basic public health services in the community by means of various media, and is encouraging residents with common diseases to see general practitioners.",

Interviews were carried out and analyzed by a multidisciplinary group in order to maintain the validity and meaningfulness of the results. Purposeful sampling was used to enhance external validity or transferability. 32 However, the findings must be interpreted in the context of the study's limitations. The data were crosssectional in nature. The possibility that the non-responding directors were different from the 15 interviewed directors can not be excluded. The study examined basic public health services from the perspective of supervisors, who do not themselves provide direct primary medical care. It did not examine the broader frame of basic public health services in the community and overall population levels. The fact that all the data for this study were collected in one city may call into question its generalizability to other locales. However, the choice of Beijing as the site for data collection has particular significance to healthcare service delivery in China because the nation's capital was one of the first cities to comprehensively implement the CHS reforms of 2006, and thus has had the longest experience with them. In addition, Beijing has traditionally served as a national test site for reforms of the CHS. Accordingly, the authors recommend that further research should be undertaken on the delivery of basic public health services with larger sampling from community providers from other cities in China.",
