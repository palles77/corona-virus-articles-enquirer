This leads to genetic instability of the cell and carcinogenesis. 13 At this point, the structural proteins L1 and L2, the targets of the current HPV vaccines, are no longer expressed. Despite continued expression of the viral antigens E6 and E7, however, it has proved challenging to elicit robust immune responses against those antigens in patients with HPV-associated cancers. [12] [13] [14] [15] E6/E7-specific precursor cells may be rare and difficult to expand in vivo because immune-inhibitory cues in the tumor environment may block initial tumor cell recognition, and subsequent T cell activation, expansion, or persistence.",

We postulated that we could identify similar mechanisms to reactivate T cells specific for cancer-associated HPV antigens. For these cells to be useful as a therapy for patients with HPV-associated malignancies, they must be expanded to numbers sufficient for administration whilst retaining representation of critical T-cell sub-populations, such as the effector and memory compartments required for persistence, and include cells with a cytotoxic T H 1 phenotype. Additionally, they should be polyclonal and preferentially target multiple epitopes in E6 and E7 antigens to avoid tumor escape by loss of a single target epitope. Here, we describe a robust and GMP-compliant approach that, in the majority of patients studied, produces HPV16 E6/E7-directed T cells with the desired phenotype, number and function for adoptive transfer to patients with HPVassociated cancers.",

These E6 and E7 peptide mixtures (pepmixes), comprising all possible HLA class I-restricted epitopes and many HLA class II-restricted epitopes for each antigen, were added to mononuclear cells isolated directly from peripheral blood. The number of IFN\u03b3-positive spot-forming cells (SFCs) was then measured as described in Methods. We found no evidence for E6/E7-reactive T cells in any individual in either the normal or patient groups. This absence of reactivity could be due to true non-responsiveness of T cells (because of the non-existence of T cells bearing TCRs recognizing E6 or E7 epitopes or their polarization towards a non-T H 1 population), or to the insensitivity of the ELISpot method to a low, but finite frequency of E6/E7-reactive precursor T cells. To distinguish these possibilities, we stimulated PBMCs with E6 and E7 peptide-loaded DCs, a strategy that has previously allowed us to expand and thus detect low frequency T cells specific for other viral antigens. 20 Even under these conditions, however, no SFCs to E6/E7 were detected.",

We reasoned instead that HPV-specific T cells from patients with HPV-associated cancers are anergized by their tumors and could therefore be \"recovered\" by more potent antigen presenting strategies, unless they happen to be physically deleted during T cell ontogeny in these patients. We therefore incorporated the cytokines IL-6, -7, -12 and -15 into the DC/T cell/pepmix cultures. This strategy enabled us to detect an E6 or E7 reactive population in 50% of cervical and 62% of oropharyngeal cancer patients (Fig. 1) , as well as in 1 of 20 normal subjects (not shown). E6/E7 reactivity, as defined in Methods, after 2 cycles of DC stimulation correlated with the presence of HPV16 DNA in the tumor sample (17/23 HPV16 + vs. 1/5 HPV16 \u2212 samples, P = 0.041). In addition, while there was a significant difference between SFCs in response to E6 or E7 versus the negative (no-peptide) control in cell lines from patients with HPV-positive tumors (P = 0.014 and 0.027, respectively), there was no significant difference in cell lines from patients with HPV-negative tumors (P = 0.173 and 0.511, respectively). Of note, this difference was also significant for the HPV-indeterminate patients (P = 0.008 and 0.044, respectively) likely because more than two thirds of those are expected to have HPV16positive tumors. There was no correlation between tumor stage and amplitude of response. To investigate if endogenously processed viral antigens can be recognized by pepmixstimulated T cells, we tested their reactivity against autologous PHA blasts transduced with a retrovirus encoding the E6 or E7 antigen. We found that cell lines that produce IFN\u03b3 in an ELISpot assay using E6 or E7 pepmix reacted identically against PHA blasts expressing E6 or E7, respectively (Fig. 1D-E) . To confirm the antigenic specificity of the cell lines, we tested them in ELISpot assays against irrelevant peptides (EBV LMP-1, HIV Gag and survivin). There was no significant difference between SFCs in response to these peptides and to the negative (no-peptide) control (P = 0.575, 0.474 and 0.593, respectively, Fig. 1F) . Hence, addition of appropriate cytokine combinations can selectively expand an HPV16specific population of T cells in individuals with HPV-associated cancers.",

These conditions expand autologous B cells that express activation markers, including HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86 ( Fig. 2A) , and can be loaded with E6 and E7 pepmixes for use in weekly stimulation of HPV-specific T cells that have been initially activated by pepmix-loaded DCs. This strategy produced >1200 fold expansion of HPV-specific T-cell lines within 5 weeks (Fig.  2B) , with an average 3.00 \u00b1 1.8 (maximum 7.0) fold expansion per round of BB stimulation. Stimulation with BB induced both an increase in total cell numbers and a raise in the percentage of E6-and E7-specific T cells, demonstrating that expansion is antigen-specific (Fig. 2C ).",

Although we could not confirm if tumors were positive for HPV16 in all patients, several studies have shown that the prevalence of HPV16 in cervical cancer and in the specific types of head and neck cancer we studied (oropharyngeal and base of the tongue) is at least 50% and 75%, 4 respectively. Moreover, even when we exclude patients of unknown tumor status and limit our analysis to the known positive and negative cases, our data still strongly support a difference in the pattern of T cell responses between HPV16positive and negative tumor patients.

While immunization with E6 and E7 peptides may result in regression of HPV-associated pre-cancerous lesions in up to 47% of individuals, 31 efforts to actively immunize patients whose infection has progressed to cancer have failed to generate significant anti-tumor activity. [12] [13] [14] [15] This is remarkable given the significant viral antigen exposure, but is consistent with the observation by many groups that HPV-specific circulating T cells are present at low to undetectable numbers in these patients. 32 It is noteworthy that a similar lack of effective anti-tumor immunity is observed in subjects with EBV-associated malignancies, in whom naturally occurring T cells with specificities to the virus-derived antigens LMP-1 and -2 are unable to control or eradicate lymphoma or nasopharyngeal cancer. In these patients, nevertheless, autologous EBV-specific CTLs can be generated ex vivo 33 and infusion of even small numbers of such cells can produce complete and sustained remission. 34 We have now demonstrated that it will be feasible to test a similar approach in patients with HPV-positive cancers.",

These adverse effects on immunity may be reversed in vitro and we have previously observed that the addition of accessory cytokines to T-cell and DC co-cultures allows the emergence of T cell responses against poorly immunogenic targets. The combination of cytokines used for this purpose (IL-6, -7, -12, -15) was chosen based on the complementary nature of their activities, and was validated empirically. IL-6 inhibits the conversion of progenitor cells to regulatory T-lymphocytes 17 and IL-7 prevents activation induced cell death, 35 both of which are likely important in this setting. IL-12 induces T H 1 responses and enhances the cytotoxicity of CD8-positive T cells 36 while IL-15 rescues anergic T cells and restores their activity against tumor associated antigens. 16 Hence, the addition of these cytokines to our cultures allowed us to expand and activate T cells that were low in frequency and likely anergic.",

Nonetheless, even though CD8 + cells may be the immediate effectors of tumor cell destruction after TCR engagement, virus/tumor specific CD4 + cells also play an important role, both by providing helper activities to CD8 + and by their own, more delayed, cytotoxic activity. 37 Indeed, we have previously observed significant clinical anti-tumor and antiviral responses after administration of predominantly CD4 + EBV or adenovirus-specific lines to patients with EBV-positive lymphoma or adenoviral infection, 18, 38 and the mechanisms for these effects and for the synergy between CD8 + and CD4 + T cells have been dissected in murine models. 39 Even though E6/7-specific T cells may directly or indirectly clear tumor cells expressing viral derived antigens, one concern about the adoptive transfer approach is that these T cells may nonetheless become inactive or be eliminated in vivo, since they will be re-exposed to the same hostile microenvironment that prevented their spontaneous emergence. The immune evasion strategies of viruses and tumors include the production of cytokines that inhibit the activity and proliferation of effector cells. One widely used mechanism is secretion of transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2), a ubiquitous cytokine with pleiotropic effects on cell growth and differentiation that plays a significant role in maintaining T-cell homeostasis by inhibiting T cell proliferation 40 Progression of pre-malignant lesions associated with HPV16 infection, such as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, results in the increased expression of TGF\u03b2-1 (one of the TGF\u03b2 isoforms), among other immunosuppressive cytokines. 41 TGF\u03b2-1 may also derive from Tregs and these are significantly increased in draining lymph nodes of patients with advanced cervical cancer 42 and in the circulation of head and neck cancer patients. 43 We have genetically modified CTLs ex vivo to render them resistant to the immune inhibitory effects of TGF\u03b2-1 and, if necessary, this strategy could be applied to our E6/7-specific cell lines. 34, 44 In addition to negative growth and survival signals, the effectiveness of adoptively transferred virus-specific CTLs may also be limited by their poor capacity to expand in vivo. 45 Systemic administration of cytokines such as IL-2 may enhance the survival of transferred antigen-specific CTLs, but can be associated with serious side effects, limiting the amount and duration of treatment. 46 Moreover, IL-2 favors the expansion of unwanted cell subsets such as Tregs, which also express the IL-2R\u03b1, and adversely affect the function of CTLs. 47 By contrast, other cytokines, such as IL-15, play an essential role in homeostatic expansion of T cells, including memory CD8 + cells, 48 and accelerate immune reconstitution in a mouse model, 49 while decreasing the number of Tregs by inducing their apoptosis. 50 Co-administration of this cytokine may thus also protect E6/7-specific cells from inhibitory effects of the tumor microenvironment.",

We combined the individual overlapping peptides spanning E6 or E7 (shown) into pools containing 4 to 7 distinct peptides, so that each individual peptide was represented in 2 of the pools (A). To pinpoint the peptide region containing the epitopes in question, once reactivity was detected within a specific pair of peptide pools (B), each line (patient OPA shown in panels B and C) was rescreened against the pertinent individual 15-mers, using individual peptides from non-reactive pools as negative controls (C). This method revealed that the putative epitopes are contained in particular regions of the antigens (aa 5-15 of E7 for OPA). This approach showed that individual lines could recognize multiple epitopes of the same antigen or at least one epitope of each antigen, confirming that our lines were functionally polyclonal. Another example (patient OTT) is shown in panels (D-F) for E6 pools, E7 pools and individual peptides, respectively. We performed a 4-hour chromium release assay against autologous targets (PHA blasts -PHA -or B-blasts -BB) loaded with E6 and E7 pepmixes or irrelevant peptides. (A) In approximately one quarter of the cell lines there was robust differential killing of autologous targets displaying E6/E7 without allogeneic killing (shown for OPA). (B) Cell lines that were not cytotoxic in this assay produced T H 1 cytokines (TNF\u03b1 shown) after exposure to the antigens, with this activity being mediated almost exclusively by CD4 cells. (C) Cell lines do not produce T H 2 cytokines in response to E6 or E7 antigens (P = 0.320 for IL-10, 0.517 for IL-5 and 0.178 for IL-4 versus negative controls; P = 0.004 for TNF-\u03b1). (D)",

(B) Average expansion of 22 HPV16-specific T-cell lines, assuming a starting population of 1\u00d710 6 PBMCs, with each successive round of stimulation (0: BL, baseline; 1: 1DC, one round of DC stimulation; 2: 2DC, two rounds of DC stimulation; 3: 2DC 1BB, one round of BB after two rounds of DC stimulation; etc.). (C) The expanded cell lines have increased specificity for HPV16 antigens as demonstrated by an increased fraction of IFN\u03b3-producing cells with each round of stimulation with autologous pepmix-loaded BBs.",
