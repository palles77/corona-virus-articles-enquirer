            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is the causative agent of a respiratory disease with a high case fatality rate. During the formation of the coronaviral replication/ transcription complex, essential steps include processing of the conserved polyprotein nsp7-10 region by the main protease M pro and subsequent complex formation of the released nsp's. Here, we analyzed processing of the coronavirus nsp7-10 region using native mass spectrometry showing consumption of substrate, rise and fall of intermediate products and complexation. Importantly, there is a clear order of cleavage efficiencies, which is influenced by the polyprotein tertiary structure. Furthermore, the predominant product is an nsp7+8(2 : 2) hetero-tetramer with nsp8 scaffold. In conclusion, native MS, opposed to other methods, can expose the processing dynamics of viral polyproteins and the landscape of protein interactions in one set of experiments. Thereby, new insights into protein interactions, essential for generation of viral progeny, were provided, with relevance for development of antivirals.",

Two-thirds of their single-strand (+)-sense RNA genome exhibit the overlapping replicase genes ORF 1a and ORF 1ab, and the other one third encode for a set of subgenomic mRNAs which are required for accessory proteins as well as for the structural proteins. Initially, ORF 1a and ORF 1ab are directly translated into either replicase polyprotein pp1a (nsp1- 11) or pp1ab (nsp1-16), respectively, depending on a ribosomal (-1)-frameshift [3] . Subsequently, the polyproteins undergo proteolytic processing into 11 or 16 individual nsp's. Eventually, the nsp's take part in forming the replication/transcription complex (RTC), a membrane-anchored, highly dynamic protein-RNA complex facilitating the replicative processes [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

This was shown in detail for the processing order of the nsp7-10 region, where domain deletions or switching as well as cleavage site mutations were lethal to the virus replication [19] . In general, the order of processing is directly dependent on the substrate specificity of M pro , which has been tested in peptide-based biochemical assays [20] [21] [22] .

Native mass spectrometry (MS) probes and detects protein complexes in protein mixtures, while keeping their non-covalent interactions intact through nano-electrospray ionization (nanoESI) [30, 31] . Furthermore, collision-induced dissociation (CID) enables the stoichiometry and topology of natively sprayed protein complexes to be deciphered, by dissociating non-covalent interactions in vacuo. Thereby, it allows the landscape of protein species from a heterogeneous sample solution to be revealed and to observe dynamic processes over time. Herein, we analyzed the processing of SARS-CoV nsp7-10 and complex formation of its sequentially released nsp's. First, the substrate specificity of SARS-CoV M pro for the cleavage sites within nsp7-10 was determined in an assay with FRET-labeled peptides. Then, we explored native MS to reveal time-resolved nsp release and complex formation upon processing of a full-length SARS-CoV nsp7-10 substrate. Specifically, the analysis via CID-MS gave insights into a preferred complex of SARS-CoV nsp7+8.",

Compared with FPS4-5 (100%), substrates FPS7-8 (17.1%) and FPS9-10 (51.8%) were less efficiently cleaved while FPS8-9 (0.1%) was almost non-cleavable. The absolute and relative substrate efficiencies determined here agree with the results of similar experiments [20, 34] . Considering that short peptides represent merely the primary structure of the cleavage site, more native-like substrates were prepared and tested to verify results obtained with these FPS's.",

This is particularly interesting for nsp8-9, because of its Coronaviridae-wide conserved NNE motif at P1 0 -P3 0 . Previously, it was suggested that this motif could confer poor substrate properties to the nsp8-9 cleavage site, which would result in a considerable influence on processing order and RTC assembly [22] . In fact, two observations made by other researchers provide an indication for a peptide-specific effect: Fan et al. analyzed the secondary structure of nsp peptides and observed that nsp8-9, comprising the NNE motif and closely resembling the FPS8-9 tested here, had a higher propensity for \u03b1-helices than other nsp peptides [37, 38] . Moreover, Chuck et al. [39] reported that \u03b2-strands in substrates promote binding to M pro . The results shown in our work indicate that the structural layout of the cleavage site is different when comparing peptide to the full-length protein, which plays a role in endowing the nsp8-9 cleavage site with decent cleavability. Since the full-length protein possesses the structural environment of the cleavage sites, we consider results with this substrate more relevant for studying the processing pattern of the CoV polyprotein.",

Most importantly, we identified an nsp7+8 (2 : 2) complex, undescribed before, which is subject to detailed analysis later on. Here, this complex' intensity in native MS remained low, most likely due to interference by the non-cleavable His-tag N-terminal of nsp7.

The MFs of nsp9 monomers and dimers (AVG \u00b1 SD, N = 3; 75 \u00b1 11% and 25 \u00b1 2%, respectively) were determined, based on the intensity ratio of the assigned peaks. Although the X-ray structure of nsp9 was reported as a dimer, its low abundance found here is consistent with a low dimer affinity in solution [40] . So far, nsp7's ability of dimerization in the absence of other proteins has already been noted, but no function has been suggested [27] and therefore, more detailed information remains elusive.

To promote interactions of nsp's with authentic amino-acid sequence, we engineered a SARS-CoV nsp7-9-His containing a cleavable His-tag at the C-terminus. Upon processing of this substrate by M pro , we tested the landscape of mass species via native MS. Peak envelopes were detected for the monomeric products nsp7, nsp8 and nsp9 as well as for M pro monomer and dimer. While nsp9 did not interact with any of the other subunits even after cleavage of the tag, nsp7+8 Upon cleavage of nsp7-9-His, a putative nsp7+8 (2 : 2) tetramer (red) emerged. Other assigned peaks correspond to M pro (asterisk), nsp7 (yellow), formed a hetero-tetramer of nsp7+8(2 : 2) (62.2 kDa) ( Figure 4 ). This stoichiometry was predicted based on the molecular weights of the subunits (2\u00d79.3 kDa + 2\u00d721.8 kDa = 62.2 kDa). However, for further evidence, molecular ions of three different charge states of the putative nsp7+8 hetero-tetramer (4449 m/z, +14; 4153 m/z, +15; 2893 m/z, +16) ( Figure 5A ) were selected as precursor and subjected to CID-MS/MS. To successively induce subunit dissociation, we increased the collision voltage (CV) stepwise. Thereby, the overall dissociation pattern was exposed ( Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure S9) , which confirmed the hetero-tetrameric (2 : 2) complex stoichiometry. Two alternative dissociation pathways revealed the arrangement of subunits within the complex ( Figure 5B ). The hetero-tetramer dissociated at lower activation energy into nsp7 and nsp7+8(1 : 2), and alternatively, at elevated collisional energy into nsp8 and nsp7+8(2 : 1). Additionally, the product ions nsp7+8(1 : 1) and nsp8(2) provided evidence that their subunits interacted in the complex. The alternative dissociation routes may have resulted from analogous energy absorption paths, either due to similar binding contribution of nsp7 and nsp8 in the complex or due to different gas-phase conformers.",

The mechanistic system of processing resembles a limited proteolysis of a folded protein, and we used native MS to monitor the covalent and non-covalent products. Thereby, we gained insights into the coordinated release of nsp monomers, intermediate products and the formation of complexes. A relatively long-lived nsp7-8 product and a short-lived nsp8-9 intermediate product were observed, which were not expected based on protease activities measured on isolated peptide substrates. Therefore, we conclude that the processing of nsp7-10 is not only coordinated by the amino-acid sequence itself but also the structural environment of the nsp inter-domain junctions. This, in turn, may lead to different processing intermediates than expected based on results from protease assays at isolated peptides. To collect evidence of such intermediates in vivo appears challenging by more traditional techniques. To reveal their relevance in the viral life-cycle, novel MS techniques may be advantageous, e.g. single-cell proteomics and in vivo cross-linking MS [41, 42] .",

Although, molecular structures of SARS-CoV nsp7+8 have been reported as dimer (1 : 1) containing N-terminally chopped nsp8 and as a hexadecamer (8 : 8) [26, 29] up to date, a hetero-tetrameric interaction has not been shown. In terms of stoichiometry and subunit connectivity, only nsp7+8(2 : 2) subcomplexes of the hexa-decamer resemble our results [29] . Specifically, in two conformers, T1 and T2 ( Figure 5C ), nsp8 builds a scaffold with head-to-tail interaction and nsp7 subunits sandwich the scaffold without self-interaction. All interfaces are mainly hydrophobic. However, three polar bonds within or in the proximity of the nsp8 shaft domain facilitate binding to nsp7. Polar bonds more readily persist in the gas phase than hydrophobic interactions, which explains higher gas-phase stability for nsp7+8(1 : 1) over nsp8 (2) . The total buried surface areas of T1 and T2 are virtually equal (Supplementary  Table S5 ). Nevertheless, the nsp8(2) dimer scaffold in T2 is compact because a loop within the N-terminal \u03b1-helix allows bending and interacting with the other nsp8, whereas in T1 the \u03b1-helix extends to interact with another tetramer in the crystal lattice. Hence, T2 represents a more likely structure of nsp7+8(2 : 2) in solution.",

While it remains a challenge to perform quantitative MS from heterogeneous protein mixtures, the usage of MFs disentangled the mass species and allowed following the processing dynamics. Intriguingly, our results suggest that the processing pattern of SARS-CoV nsp7-10 could have evolved to tailor a remaining nsp7-8 intermediate product. This intermediate product may have an independent enzymatic function [27] but finally serves as an efficient precursor for nsp7+8(2 : 2) hetero-tetramer formation, as stimulant of the CoV RdRp [24] . Extending our approach to processing of different CoV species and longer polyproteins will increase understanding of the formation of the functional CoV-RTC.",
