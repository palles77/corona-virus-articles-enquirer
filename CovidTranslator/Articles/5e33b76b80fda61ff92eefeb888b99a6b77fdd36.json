            "text": "Betanodaviruses, members of the Nodaviridae family, are the causative agents of viral nervous necrosis in fish and infection by which cause high mortality in larvae and juveniles in a wide range of marine fish species in Asia, Europe, Australia, Martinique, and Tahit. Greasy grouper (Epinephelus tauvina) nervous necrosis viruses (GGNNV) were investigated for their apoptotic activity in culture cells. GGNNV infection of sea bass (SB) cells appeared to induce a typical cytopathic effect (CPE), i.e., cytoplasmic vacuolation, thinning, rounding up, detachment of infected cells from the cultured dish, and eventually cell lysis and death. The infected SB cells underwent DNA fragmentation and stained positive in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, suggesting that GGNNV infection induced apoptosis in SB cells. In addition, GGNNV-infected SB cells showed an increased activity of caspase-8-like proteases (IETDase) and caspase-3-like proteases (IETDase), whereas inhibitor of caspase-8 and caspase-3 reduced GGNNV-induced apoptosis. This suggests that GGNNV may promote apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway in SB cells. Protein \u2423, the precursor of GGNNV capsid proteins, was transiently expressed in SB and Cos-7 cells. The DNA fragmentation and TUNEL positive signal were apparent in SB and Cos-7 cells expressing protein \u2423, suggesting that protein \u2423 may serve as an apoptotic inducer in these cells. Moreover, expression of protein \u2423 resulted in the activation of caspase-3-like proteases in both cells, which could be inhibited by a caspase-3-like protease specific inhibitor DEVD-CHO peptide. These results suggest that fish caspases are important elements in GGNNV-meditated apoptosis.",

            "text": "Apoptosis or programmed cell death (PCD) is the process whereby an individual cell of multicellular organisms undergoes systematic self-destruction in response to a wide variety of stimuli. During this process, cells display characteristic morphological changes, including chromatin condensation, plasma membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, and fragmentation into membrane-bound bodies (Majno and Joris, 1995; Vaux et al., 1994; Wyllie et al., 1980) . There are two different mechanisms by which a cell commits suicide by apoptosis. One is generated by signals arising within the cells, which involves B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and subsequently leads to the release of apoptosis protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and cytochrome c. Then the released cytochrome c and Apaf-1 bind to caspase-9 and other molecules to form the apoptosome. The sequential activation of one caspase by another creates an expanding cascade of proteolytic activity, which leads to digestion of structural proteins in the cytoplasm and degradation of chromosomal DNA. The other mechanism is triggered by death activators outside the cell, which bind to receptors at the cell surface, such as Fas (CD95 antigen) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors, and transmit a signal to the cytoplasm that leads to activation of caspase-8, which initiates a cascade of caspase activation to cause the formation of membrane-bound apoptotic bodies (Adams and Cory, 1998; Everett and McFadden, 2001; Jagus et al., 1999; Lee et al., 1997; Li et al., 1997; Teodoro and Branton, 1997) .",

Host cells defend themselves from viral infection by apoptosis, but viruses have also developed a range of strategies to fight against the host immune response and apoptosis; they even make use of apoptosis to propagate. For some viruses, inhibition of apoptosis appears to be essential for the maintenance of viral latency. But for many other viruses, the careful induction of apoptosis during lytic infection may represent the basis for cytotoxity and be on important outlet for dissemination of progeny virus (Hardwick, 1998; Roulston et al., 1999) .

Two genera have been distinguished within the Nodaviridae family: the alphanodaviruses that were originally isolated from insects and the betanodaviruses that infect a wide variety of larval and juvenile marine fish (Ball et al., 2000) . The fish disease caused by betanodavirus is spreading worldwide, resulting in severe morbidity and mortality and significant economic losses to the aquaculture industry. Infected fish showed abnormal swimming behavior, such as erratic swimming in circles, or to the right, lying on their sides or belly up. Histopathological changes are characterized by extensive cellular vacuolations and neuronal degeneration in the central nervous system and retina (Delsert et al., 1997; Grotmol et al., 1999; Mori et al., 1992; Munday, 1997; Nakai et al., 1994) . Despite their greater economic impact, the viruses in this genus are less studied. Therefore, it is essential to characterize their molecular biology to understand the mechanism of their infection.",

To investigate if GGNNV kills cells by apoptosis and if there is a correlation between CPE and apoptosis, the membrane permeable DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342 was used to stain the nuclei of the infected cells to see any gradual morphological change of the nuclei. As shown in Fig. 2 , image D, the nuclei became distorted and condensed in GGNNV-infected cells at 48 h PI, whereas in mock-infected cells (Fig. 2 , image B), the nuclei remained uniformly stained, suggesting that apoptosis might be triggered in SB cells during GGNNV infection.",

On the other hand, many viruses have evolved mechanisms to cope with cellular antiviral responses. One of these viral strategies is triggering apoptosis during infection. In the case of virus-infected cells, apoptosis seems to represent a very efficient mechanism by which the virus can induce cell death and disseminate progeny while limiting induction of inflammation. The presence of progeny virions in membrane-bound bodies also protects them from contact with neutralizing antibodies. A lot of viruses, such as Adenoviridae, Papovaviridae, Herpesviridae, etc, have been shown to use apoptosis to kill the infected cells at the end of infection to spread the viral progeny to nearby cells (Krajcsi and Wold, 1998; Roulston et al., 1999; Teodoro and Branton, 1997) . This is the first report showing that GGNNV is capable of inducing apoptosis. This is demonstrated by several methods including analysis of total cellular DNA for low molecular weight DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis, TUNEL labeling for detection of DNA fragmentation in situ, and Hoechst 33342 staining for nuclear morphology. There was general agreement of the results: in the analysis of total cellular DNA, DNA fragmentation bands were detected at 24 h PI, which peaked at 48 h PI in GGNNVinfected cells. Also, the TUNEL positive signal was much stronger at 48 h PI than at 24 h PI. Similarly, IETDase and DEVDase activity induced by GGNNV infection was much higher at 48 h PI than at 24 h PI. These results suggested that there is a correlation between appearance of apoptosis and CPE that peaked at 48 h PI.",

At least two major pathways for caspase activation have been delineated, including a pathway linked to the TNF family of death receptors (\"extrinsic\") and a pathway activated by mitochondria (\"intrinsic\"). The apical proteases in the ex- Fig. 6 . Immunoblotting assay showing the expression of proteins A and \u2423 in eukaryotic expression system. Cell lysates from Cos-7 and SB cells transfected with pEGFP-RNA1 and pEGFP-RNA2 were electrophoresed in a 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and detected by the monospecific antibodies against proteins A (lanes 1 and 4) and \u2423 (lanes 2 and 5), respectively. Lysates from cells transfected with pEGFP-C1 (lanes 3 and 6) were indicated as negative control. trinsic and intrinsic pathways are caspase-8 and caspase-9, respectively (Salvesen and Dixit, 1997) . The results of high activity of IETD-pNA which can be inhibited by IETD-fmk in GGNNV-infected SB cells suggested that GGNNV triggers apoptosis of SB cells primarily through mechanisms that engage the extrinsic pathway at or above the level of caspase-8. Caspase-8 directly or indirectly initiates the proteolytic activities of downstream effector caspases, such as caspase-3. When downstream \"effector\" caspase-3 is activated by apoptotic stimuli, it activates a caspase-activated DNase (CAD), which is present in the cytosol complexed with its inhibitor of CAD (ICAD). Caspase-3 cleaves ICAD and allows CAD to translocate to the nucleus and degrade DNA (Janicke et al., 1998) . In fact, many viruses induce caspase-dependent apoptosis, such as murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) , Langat flavivirus (LGTV) (Prikhod'ko et al., 2001) , and poliovirus (Agol et al., 1998) . The results that GGNNV infection induced activation of caspase-3-like proteases and GGNNV-induced apoptosis could be inhibited by DEVD-CHO indicate that fish caspases are important mediators of virus-induced cell death.",

            "text": "It has been known that many viral proteins are involved in both the induction and suppression of apoptosis. Rubella virus capsid protein (Duncan et al., 2000) , VP2 of IBDV (Fernadez-Arias et al., 1997) , and E protein of LGTV (Prikhod'ko et al., 2001) have been shown to induce apoptosis alone in cell culture and play an important role in viral pathogenesis. Other viruses, including adenoviruses, simian virus 40, and human papillomavirus, etc. have evolved a myriad of proteins to inhibit various steps in the inflammatory and apoptotic response pathways to protect infected cells from early death (Roulston et al. 1999) . To localize possible inducers of apoptosis in betanodavirus GGNNV infection, we transiently expressed the viral protein A and protein \u2423 in SB and Cos-7 cells and found that protein \u2423 was capable of inducing apoptosis in both kinds of transfected cells. Protein \u2423 is the precursor of capsid proteins and is important for viral assembly. Here, protein \u2423 of GGNNV was demonstrated to be capable of inducing apoptosis by DNA fragmentation and TUNEL staining in transfected SB and Cos-7 cells at 48 h post-transfection. In addition, TUNEL positive signal was dramatically decreased when cells were treated with DEVD-CHO (data not shown). The expression of protein \u2423 might trigger the in- At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed and analyzed for detection of apoptosis by TUNEL staining, which detects the DNA breakage (brown color). A and C indicate TUNEL-labeling of Cos-7 and SB cells that were transfected with EGFP-RNA2 at 48 h post-transfection, respectively. B and D indicate Cos-7 and SB cells that were transfected with pEGFP-C1 at 48 h post-transfection, respectively. Magnification X200. Fig. 8 . Protein \u2423 induces activation of caspase-3 proteases in both SB and Cos-7 cells. Cell lysates from SB or Cos-7 cells transfected with plasmids pEGFP-RNA2 or pEGFP-C1 were harvested at 24 h post-transfection and assayed for DEVDase activity using the caspase-3 colorimetric substrate DEVD-pNA. In addition, cells transfected with pEGFP-RNA2 were treated with DEVD-CHO. The pEGFP-C1 was used as a negative control and to maintain equal plasmid DNA concentration for each of the transfections. Values shown are means from duplicate experiments. ternal death signal of cells to induce apoptosis, which serves as a host defense mechanism against viral proliferation. Further work needs to analyze its proapoptotic domain and subcellular localization in virus-infected cells to find its apoptosis mechanism.",

Meanwhile, the apoptosis was decreased by DEVD-CHO treatment demonstrated in TUNEL staining, which means the apoptosis induced by GGNNV was caspase dependent. Similarly, transient expression of protein \u2423 from GGNNV in two cell lines; SB and Cos-7 cells, could activate caspase-3-like proteases and its activity could be inhibited by DEVD-CHO. Moreover, the reduction of TUNEL positive signal was observed in cells treated by DEVD-CHO. These results indicate that the apoptosis induced by protein \u2423 in fish and mammalian cells possibly uses the same caspase-dependent pathway. But the function of apoptosis in the true life cycle of the GGNNV infection needs more investigation.",
