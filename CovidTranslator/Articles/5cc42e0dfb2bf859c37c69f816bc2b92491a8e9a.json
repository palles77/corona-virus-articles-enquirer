A longitudinal study was conducted among pilgrims at the Hajj 2014 using an iPhone app with separate questionnaires for three study phases covering before, during, and after Hajj. Forty-eight pilgrims from 13 countries downloaded the app. Respondents were aged between 21 and 61 (median 36) years and 58.5% (24/41) were male. Of these, 85% (41/48) completed the first phase, 52% (25/41) completed both the second and third phases, and 25 of these reported meningococcal vaccination, with 36% (9/25) receiving other vaccines. All (25) reported hand hygiene use and 64% (16/25) wore a facemask at some point during the pilgrimage. Four (6%) reported close contact with camels. Respiratory symptoms commenced from the 4th day of Hajj, with sore http://dx.",

Incidence of acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) is high [1, 2] . Moreover, emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia and other countries poses a new public health challenge [3] . In order to reduce the risk of ARI among Hajj pilgrims, the Saudi Arabian health authority recommends a range of infection control measures [4] , however, compliance to these measures is highly variable [5] [6] [7] [8] . Several studies have addressed pilgrim knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) towards preventive measures and infectious diseases, finding that their understanding about the potential severity of respiratory infection and the need for protective measures was inadequate [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Gautret et al. [9] found that <50% of French pilgrims were aware of social distancing, available treatment options, and facemask use as precautionary measures against the spread of respiratory infections. Other studies assessed pilgrim knowledge of emerging infections, such as MERS-CoV and Ebola, and found that 60% of pilgrims were not aware of MERS-CoV circulation in Arabia and about 40% had no accurate knowledge of Ebola transmission. However, longitudinal studies examining these questions before, during, and after travel are lacking.",

Several studies have demonstrated their usefulness in conveying health messages in a variety of contexts and audiences, with high response and retention rates and fewer dataentry errors during descriptive studies and randomised controlled trials [14, 15] . Thus, smartphones may provide better platforms to conduct prospective surveys among Hajj pilgrims than conventional ''pen and paper\"-based methods [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Additional advantages include constant internet connection, location-detection services, and user proximity making it an ideal tool for collecting infectious disease data during mass gatherings. Data concerning smartphone usefulness in infectious disease research at mass gatherings are very limited [19] . Therefore, we conducted a pilot study using a smartphone app to examine its feasibility to track not only Hajj pilgrim KAP regarding preventive measures, but also symptom onset and participation in high-risk activities before, during, and after Hajj 2014.",

We developed an iPhone application (app) called 'Hajj Health Diary', utilising the 'Health Monitor' app template [20] and released it in the Apple app store on September 5, 2014. Users started by registering their device in our online secure research database and were assigned a unique identifier for their device. This method was used successfully in previous studies [15, 16, 21] .

Evidence suggests that MERS-CoV can be transmitted to humans through close contact with an infected camel [27] . Interestingly, our study identified that some pilgrims had close contact with camels, including visiting camel farms, photo opportunities with camels, and drinking their raw milk. Through this survey, we identified one Australian pilgrim who had close contact with camels and subsequently developed respiratory symptoms within 1 week of returning home. Further follow up of the case was not possible, however, given that no MERS-CoV case was reported in Australia, it is highly unlikely that the person had MERS-CoV. Therefore, this pilot study suggests that smartphones could help detect patients with potential emerging infectious diseases. Electronic surveillance to identify outbreaks of infectious diseases at a mass gathering has been attempted previously [28] . For instance, surveillance using electronic medical records deployed during the 2002 Winter Olympic Games helped detect an influenza outbreak, which was subsequently described with the aid of laboratory diagnosis [29, 30] . Digital interfaces, including smartphones, were applied at the 2012 London Olympics to identify illnesses and injuries among athletes [31] . Our study, the first of its kind at Hajj, demonstrates the feasibility of a smartphone app in a prospective survey of pilgrim illness and adherence to preventive measures throughout the course of travel.",

We speculate that earlier app release will result in greater numbers of participants. Because this survey was conducted only in English, multilingual applications could have expanded participation into diverse language groups. Data on pilgrim demographics show that 60-80% of pilgrims are older than 40 years of age [8, 32] , while most smartphone users are aged 25-44 years [33] , which might have impacted study outcomes. However, since smartphone use is gradually becoming ubiquitous, respondent demographics are likely to be less important in the future. Finally, we designed the app only for iPhone users, thus excluding users of other smartphone platforms, such as Android or Windows mobile. Extending availability of this app to other platforms will likely increase participation rates.",
