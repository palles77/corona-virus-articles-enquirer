            "text": "Immune system factors including complement pathway activation are increasingly linked to the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Complement protein, C1q, binds to and helps to clear immune complexes composed of immunoglobulins coupled to antigens. The antigenic stimuli for C1q activation in schizophrenia are not known. Food sensitivities characterized by elevated IgG antibodies to bovine milk caseins and wheat glutens have been reported in individuals with schizophrenia. Here, we examined the extent to which these food products might comprise the antigen component of complement C1q immune complexes in individuals with recent onset schizophrenia (n=38), non-recent onset schizophrenia (n=61) and non-psychiatric controls (n=63). C1q seropositivity was significantly associated with both schizophrenia groups (recent onset, odds ratio (OR)=8.02, p\u22640.008; non-recent onset, OR=3.15, p\u22640.03) compared to controls (logistic regression models corrected for age, sex, race and smoking status). Casein-and/ or gluten-IgG binding to C1q was significantly elevated in the non-recent onset group compared to controls (OR=4.36, p\u22640.01). Significant amounts of C1q-casein/gluten-related immune complexes and C1q correlations with a marker for gastrointestinal inflammation in non-recent onset schizophrenia suggests a heightened rate of food antigens in the systemic circulation, perhaps via a disease-associated altered intestinal permeability. In individuals who are in the early stages of disease onset, C1q activation may reflect the formation of immune complexes with non-casein-or non-gluten-related antigens, the presence of C1q autoantibodies, and/or a dissociated state of immune complex components. In conclusion, complement activation may be a useful biomarker to diagnose schizophrenia early during the course of the disease. Future prospective studies should evaluate the impacts of casein-and gluten-free diets on C1q activation in schizophrenia.",

C1q is best known for its role in binding to and facilitating the clearing of antigenantibody immune complexes from systemic circulation (Walport, 2001a; Walport, 2001b) . In recent years, however, C1q has been identified as a cellular component involved in synaptic pruning during perinatal central nervous system development (Boulanger, 2009; Stevens et al., 2007) . Mouse models indicate a high level of early postnatal C1q expression in the brain, as well as a possible neural C1q reactivation in adults in response to cellular signals of neurodegeneration (Boulanger, 2009; Stevens et al., 2007) .",

Food sensitivities to bovine milk caseins and wheat glutens, as evident by antibody-based measures, have been reported in a number of studies of schizophrenia over the years (Cascella et al., 2011; Dohan, 1981; Dohan et al., 1972; Karlsson et al., 2012; Niebuhr et al., 2011; Reichelt and Landmark, 1995; Samaroo et al., 2010; Severance et al., 2010a) , an indication that these foods might be possible antigenic candidates for C1q binding.

If food antigen exposure can be linked to a versatile, synaptically-active, basic immune protein such as C1q, future studies will be implemented to explore if caseins and glutens might impact neurodevelopment through a C1q-mediated pathway.",

The corresponding odds ratio for disease association in the non-recent onset group was also significant at 3.15, with an effect size of 0.80. Secondly, we established that milk casein and wheat gluten comprise the antigen component of C1q-based immune complexes in a prominent portion of individuals with non-recent onset schizophrenia.

The measured C1q immunoreactivity could reflect C1q binding to immunoglobulins coupled to other types of bound antigens, such as antigens from microbial agents. C1q immunoreactivity, however, was not strongly correlated with IgG from a series of infectious disease antigens, but was correlated to IgG from food antigens. Therefore, even though the recent onset group did not show significant numbers of intact food antigenrelated immune complexes, the relevant constituents, C1q and food antigen IgG, were nevertheless present and correlated. It may be that immune complexes were not yet formed in this early stage disease group, or perhaps other conditions led to the dissociation of the components.",

Following milk ingestion, peak levels of unbound circulating bovine casein corresponded to a period when immune complex concentrations were at a minimum, an indication that antigen excess might be involved with complex dissociation . One of the first studies published to examine the role of immune complex formation in schizophrenia reported that levels of immune complexes in patients tended to correlate with disease duration (Vetlugina et al., 1984) . This result is consistent with our discovery of food antigen-based immune complexes predominately in the longer-term schizophrenia group as compared to those with a recent onset of disease. However, within each of the schizophrenia groups, we found that immune complexes were more often present in individuals who were younger compared to older seronegative counterparts. These data suggest that food sensitivities may more likely affect younger subsets of patients, even for those who have been afflicted with the disease for longer periods of time (i.e. recent onset vs non-recent onset).",

GI permeability brought on by inflammation represents a logical means by which food antigens might be introduced into systemic circulation. Cunningham-Rundles and colleagues put forth years ago that the formation of milk casein-related complexes is likely a response to a greater circulating peptide load following the excessive absorption of milk proteins across the gastrointestinal tract (Cunningham-Rundles et al., 1978; Cunningham-Rundles and Carr, 1986 ).

The current study is cross-sectional, and therefore, any changing levels of immune complex components over time are not captured in this type of study. Age, sex and smoking status were all identified as possible confounding variables, and thus were included in the multivariate regression models utilized here. As discussed earlier, immune complexes were more often found in younger individuals in both schizophrenia groups; for sex and smoking status, we found no significant associations of these variables with the present results. In previous studies of mood disorders, we were able to disentangle a particular association of food antigen antibodies with clinical features of mania and psychosis (Dickerson et al., 2012; Severance et al., 2010b ). In the current study, however, evaluation of the clinical impact of our findings in schizophrenia is limited. Large-scale, well-controlled, prospective clinical studies are required to identify specific symptoms that might be affected by casein and gluten intake in individuals with schizophrenia and to evaluate how dietary modifications might affect symptom severity.",

In the context of the present study, we can speculate that an altered function of complement and other immune-related genes might allow the decreased clearance of circulating antigens, which might in turn reflect an imbalance in immune complex components. Genetic studies of the complement pathway in schizophrenia reveal that variants containing single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the C1QB gene, in complement control-related genes and in the complement surface receptor gene CD46 all segregate with the disorder (Havik et al., 2011; Zakharyan et al., 2011) . Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are also of interest to our C1q findings, because MHC class I proteins may similarly act to modify synaptic plasticity during neurodevelopment (Boulanger, 2009; Shatz, 2009 ). Genome-wide association studies in schizophrenia identified the chromosomal area housing the MHC genes as a potentially important candidate region (Purcell et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2009; Stefansson et al., 2009) . These associations suggest the possibility that genetic variants in MHC alleles might control how antigens are recognized and which antibodies are actually generated.",

In a large birth registry-based study in Sweden, elevated levels of maternal anti-gliadin IgG were recently found to increase the risk of nonaffective psychosis in offspring (Karlsson et al., 2012) . Maternally-derived food antigen IgG, therefore, could in theory contribute to fetal or postnatal activation of C1q. If this process occurs during a critical period of C1q-mediated synaptic pruning, then it is reasonable to predict that there will be adverse effects on synaptic organization in the brain. Upon reexposure as adults, food antigens separately or in conjunction with C1q reactivation could contribute to and/or aggravate psychiatric symptoms and behaviors.",

In individuals who are in the earlier stages of their disease, C1q activation is most prominent and may reflect the generation of C1q autoantibodies, formation of immune complexes with non-food-related antigens, or the dissociated state of immune complex components. Our data provide a starting point to examine if perinatal exposure to food antigens in susceptible individuals represents a plausible means by which C1q synaptic pruning defects could be generated and ultimately result in symptoms and behaviors characteristic of schizophrenia.",
