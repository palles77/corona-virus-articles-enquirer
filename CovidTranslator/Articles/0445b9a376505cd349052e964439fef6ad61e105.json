Moreover, the frontline Chinese health care workers provided care without proper personal protective equipment (PPE) to shield them from harm. In a sobering article in the Los Angeles Times entitled \"Doctors and nurses fighting coronavirus in China die of both infection and fatigue,\" (3) Alice Su reports that there were \"18 reported deaths of medical workers involved in the COVID-19 response as of Monday (February 24 th ), including nurses and doctors who died not because of infection but because of cardiac arrest or other ailments due to overwork and fatigue. One victim was hit by a car while taking temperatures on a highway.\" The article also mentions Dr. Peng Yinhua (age 29), who postponed his planned wedding on February 1, so that he could continue to provide care to COVID-19 patients. Dr. Yinhua promised his pregnant fianc\u00e9e that they would have a ceremony after the outbreak had passed: he died of COVID-19 on February 21 st .",

Fully understanding the COVID-19 attributable deaths of healthcare workers in China, and for that matter, the COVID-19 attributable deaths of healthcare workers all around the word will take some time to process, insofar as many of these deaths were preventable. As noted, there is plenty of blame to go around. The unbelievable courage of the men and women who provided care to COVID-19 patients, knowing that they might die from the same mysterious illness that was killing their patients, is an example of what is truly remarkable and best about humanity. Their lesson of sacrifice and selfless caring is one that can never be washed away, nor ever diminished. Not ever. To this end, we dedicate this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science to the Chinese healthcare workers who died from COVID-19, as well as all of the other health care workers around the world who are caring for COVID-19 patients. A partial list of the names of the frontline Chinese physicians and nurses who died of COVID-19 (online search date 3/20/20) follows at the end of this Editors Page.",

            "text": "January 1 st , 2020. Based on the results of deep sequencing and investigations by five independent laboratories, Chinese officials reported on January 7 th , 2019 that the causative agent of the mystery pneumonia was a novel coronavirus (nCoV). Sequence analysis revealed that the 2019-nCoV possesses a typical genome structure of coronavirus belonging to the cluster of betacoronaviruses that includes Bat-SARS-like (SL)-ZC45, Bat-SL ZXC21, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Based on the genomic content of Covid viruses, 2019-nCov appears to be more closely related to bat-SL-CoV ZC45 and bat-SL-CoV ZXC2, and more distantly related to SARS-CoV (2). On January 11 th 2019, China reported the first death from nCoV in a 61-year-old man who purchased goods from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. In the weeks that followed, the coronavirus outbreak spread across China, slithering into neighboring countries and continents. By January 13, the World Health Organization reported a case of 2019-nCoV in a woman in Thailand, who had arrived from Wuhan. Thus began what we now recognize as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.",
