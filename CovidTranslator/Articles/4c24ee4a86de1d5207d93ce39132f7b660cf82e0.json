            "text": "Clean freshwater lies at the heart of human society and monitoring its quality is paramount. In addition to chemical controls, traditional microbiological water tests focus on the detection of specific bacterial pathogens. The direct tracing of all aquatic DNA poses a more profound alternative. Yet, this has hitherto been underused due to challenges in cost and logistics. Here we present a simple, fast, inexpensive and comprehensive freshwater diagnostics workflow centred around portable nanopore DNA sequencing. Using defined bacterial compositions and spatiotemporal microbiota from surface water of an example river in Cambridge (UK), our study shows how nanopore sequencing can be readily integrated for the assessment of aquatic bacterial diversity and pollution. We provide a computational benchmark that features more than ten taxonomic classification tools to derive guidelines for bacterial DNA analyses with nanopore data. Through complementary physicochemical measurements, we find that nanopore metagenomics can depict fine temporal gradients along the main hydrological axis of an urban-rural interface and yield high-resolution pathogen maps that address concerns of public health.",

The main driver of this is the portable, smartphone-sized MinION device from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), which enables real-time DNA sequencing using nanopores 9 . Nanopore read lengths can be comparably long (currently up to ~2*10 6 bases 10 ), which is enabled by continuous electrical sensing of sequential nucleotides along single DNA strands. In connection with a laptop or cloud access for the translation of raw voltage signal into nucleotides (basecalling), nanopore sequencing can be used to rapidly monitor long DNA sequences in remote locations. Although there are still common concerns about the technology's base-level accuracy, mobile MinION setups have already proven powerful for real-time tracing of bacterial and viral pathogen outbreaks [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

Our benchmark involves the design and optimisation of essential experimental steps for multiplexed MinION usage in the context of local environments, together with an evaluation of computational methods for the bacterial classification of nanopore sequencing reads from metagenomic libraries. To showcase the resolution of sequencing-based aquatic monitoring in a spatiotemporal setting, we combine DNA analyses with physicochemical measurements of surface water samples collected at nine locations within a confined ~12 kilometre reach of the River Cam passing through the city of Cambridge (UK) in April, June and August 2018. Spirosomaceae (17.7 %), and NS11-12 marine group (12.5 %), followed by Arcobacteraceae (4.8 %), Sphingomonadaceae (2.9 %) and Rhodobacteraceae (2.5 %) (Figure 2d ). Members of these families are commonly associated with freshwater environments; for example, Burkholderiaceae reads mostly originate from aquatic genera such as Limnohabitans, Rhodoferax or Aquabacterium, which further validates the suitability of this environmental nanopore sequencing workflow.",

Barcoded shotgun nanopore sequencing protocols may pose a viable alternative strategy to bypass pitfalls often observed in amplicon-based workflows, namely taxon-specific primer biases 17 Although it is to be expected that short-read metagenomics technology continues to provide valuable environmental insights, as shown through recent cataloguing efforts for world's ocean 54 and soil 55 microbiomes, these traditional platforms are cumbersome for monitoring remote environments or low-resource settings. The MinION technology is considerably less challenging to transport, operate and maintain, and our results show that spatiotemporal nanopore sequencing could be readily adapted for multiplexed bacterial pathogen tracing in epidemic contexts. We reason that the low investment costs (Supplementary Table 3 ), the convenience of MinION handling and data analysis will allow for such endeavours to become increasingly accessible to citizens and public health organisations around the world, ultimately democratising the opportunities and benefits of DNA sequencing.

Samples were complemented with a negative control (deionised water) and a mock community control composed of eight bacterial species in known mixture proportions (Materials and Methods). To obtain valid taxonomic assignments from freshwater sequencing profiles using nanopore sequencing, 13 different classification tools were compared through several performance metrics (Supplementary Figure 1, Materials and Methods). Root mean square errors (RMSE) between observed and expected bacteria of the mock community differed slightly across all classifiers. An Enterobacteriaceae overrepresentation was observed across all replicates and classification methods, pointing towards a consistent Escherichia coli amplification bias potentially caused by skewed taxonomic specificities of the selected 16S primer pair (27f and 1492r) 17 . Robust quantifications were obtained by Minimap2 18 alignments against the SILVA 132 database 19 , for which 99.68 % of classified reads aligned to the expected mock community taxa. Minimap2 classifications reached the second lowest RMSE (excluding Enterobacteriaceae), and relative quantifications were highly consistent between mock community replicates. Benchmarking of the classification tools on one aquatic sample further confirmed Minimap2's reliable performance, although other tools such as SPINGO 20 , MAPseq 21 , or IDTAXA 22 also produced highly concordant results despite considerable variations in processing speed and memory usage (data not shown). Diversity analysis and river core microbiome Using Minimap2 classifications within our bioinformatics consensus workflow (Supplementary Figure 2, Materials and Methods), we then inspected sequencing profiles of three independent MinION runs for a total of 30 river DNA isolates and six controls. This yielded ~8.3 million sequences with exclusive barcode assignments (Figure 2a, Supplementary Table 2). Overall, 55.9 % (n = 4,644,194) of raw reads could be taxonomically assigned to the family level (Figure 2b). To account for variations in sample sequencing depth, rarefaction with a cut-off at 37,000 reads was applied across all samples. While preserving ~90 % of the original family level taxon richness (Mantel test, R = 0.814, p = 2.1*10 -4 ; Supplementary Figure 3), this conservative thresholding resulted in the exclusion of 14 samples, mostly from June, for subsequent high-resolution analyses. The 16 remaining surface water samples revealed moderate levels of microbial heterogeneity (Figure 2b, Supplementary Figure 3): microbial family alpha diversity ranged between 0.46 (June-6) and 0.92 (April-7) (Simpson index), indicating partially low-level evenness with a few taxonomic families that account for the majority of the metagenomic signal. Hierarchical clustering of taxon profiles showed a dominant core microbiome across all aquatic samples (clusters C2 and C4, Figure 2c).

The most predominant bacteria in this sewage pipe outflow are typically found in wastewater sludge or have been shown to contribute to nutrient pollution from effluents of wastewater plants, such as Haliangiaceae, Nitospiraceae, Rhodocyclaceae, and Saprospiracea 30,32 (Figure 3c). Using multiple sequence alignments between nanopore reads and pathogenic species references, we further resolved the phylogenies of three common potentially pathogenic genera occurring in our river samples, Pseudomonas, Legionella and Salmonella (Supplementary Figure 7, Materials and Methods). While Legionella and Salmonella diversities only presented negligible levels of known harmful species, a cluster of sequencing reads in downstream sections indicated a low abundance of the opportunistic, environmental pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Supplementary Figure 7).",
