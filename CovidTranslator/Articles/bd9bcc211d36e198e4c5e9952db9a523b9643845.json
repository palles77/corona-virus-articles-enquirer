Recently, we identified Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole cell lysate (Mtb WCL) as a potent mucosal adjuvant to modified live PRRSV vaccine (PRRS-MLV). In this study, pigs were unvaccinated or vaccinated with PRRS-MLV plus Mtb WCL, intranasally, and challenged with either homologous (strain VR2332) or virulent heterologous (strain MN184) PRRSV; subsequently, euthanized at three time points post-challenge to evaluate lung immune responses. Microscopic examination of lung sections revealed reduced disruption of the lung architecture and less of interstitial pneumonia in vaccinated, compared to unvaccinated MN184 challenged pigs. The restimulated lung and peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed increased proliferation of CD8 + lymphocytes, and in the lung homogenate increased secretion of nitric oxide was detected in vaccinated MN184 challenged pigs. In summary, the adjuvant effects of Mtb WCL to PRRS-MLV resulted in favorable anti-PRRSV immune microenvironment in the lungs to help better viral clearance.",

            "text": "is the most devastating problem plaguing the global swine industry within the last two decades. The annual economic losses due to PRRS is estimated to be $664 million in the US (1) . PRRS is characterized by both respiratory and reproductive abnormalities (2) (3) (4) , with major losses from reproductive failure associated with stillbirths, mummifications, weak born piglets, and high preweaning mortality (5) (6) (7) . The respiratory form leads to pneumonia, reduced feed intake with chronically recurring illness, and debilitation with potentially high mortality. The causative agent PRRS virus (PRRSV) is an Arterivirus having a positive sense RNA genome. The PRRSV is prone to constant genetic and antigenic variations. Based on its genetic diversity, the PRRSV can be divided into two genotypes, Type1 (European) and Type 2 (North American). The strains Lelystad and VR2332 are the reference prototype strains of Type 1 and Type 2 PRRSV, respectively. PRRSV replicates in alveolar macrophages and persists for up to 150 days in the lymphoid tissues (8) . The porcine immune system is unable to mount an effective anti-PRRSV immune response in the first few weeks post-infection (9, 10) ; attributed to dampened production of anti-viral cytokines, virus neutralizing antibodies, and cell-mediated immune responses. In addition, immunosuppression caused by the virus makes infected pigs prone to secondary bacterial and viral infections (11) .",

Mucosal tissues and associated lymphoid organs contain approximately 80% of total immune cells in the body, and stimulation of the mucosal immune system leads to generation of both systemic and mucosal immune responses, resulting in effective prevention of entry and establishment of pathogens (20, 21) . Recently, we have demonstrated that intranasal co-administration of PRRS-MLV and adjuvant Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole cell lysate (Mtb WCL) can overcome the vaccine induced immunosuppression with concomitant increase in host innate and adaptive immune responses, associated with better protection against a virulent heterologous PRRSV MN184 challenge (12, 17, 22, 23) . We have also shown that protective anti-PRRSV immune response elicited in pigs to PRRS-MLV was mediated by the adjuvant effects of Mtb WCL, as pigs vaccinated with only PRRS-MLV failed to elicit adequate immune responses (22) . In continuation, this article deals with aspects of microscopic lung pathology, proliferation of PRRSV specific CD8 + lymphocytes, and production of an important innate molecule 'nitric oxide' in the lungs of pigs vaccinated (PRRS-MLV + Mtb WCL) and challenged with PRRSV.",

Cells untreated or treated with Concavalin A were used as negative and positive control, respectively. Following 3 days of incubation, cells were washed and stained with R-phycoerythrine conjugated anti-pig CD8 antibody (clone 76-2-11, BD Biosciences). Finally, cells were fixed and 50,000 to 100,000 events acquired using the FACS AriaII (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer and analyzed for CFSE and PE stained lymphocytes. The cell proliferation data was analyzed by FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc. OR) to obtain the proliferation index (PI) of each sample. The PI denotes the average number of cell divisions the responding lymphocytes underwent after subtracting from the background (initial population of cells at generation '0').",

As a potent mucosal adjuvant, we used mechanically lyzed endotoxin-free WCL of Mtb which contains predominantly soluble intracellular bacterial proteins and is almost free from toxic cell wall lipid components (31) (Torrelles JB, personal communication). Clinically, pigs administered with Mtb WCL did not show any signs of side effects. In vaccinated (PRRS-MLV plus Mtb WCL) pigs, reduced gross lung pathology and significantly reduced viremia were attributed to adjuvant mediated innate and PRRSV specific adaptive immune responses (22) .

Since the PRRSV replicates in the lungs of infected pigs, such information is important. In our study, increased proliferation of total PRRSV-specific lymphocytes in the lungs (LMNC) and blood (PBMC) of vaccinated compared to unvaccinated, and either PRRSV strain challenged pigs was detected ( Fig. 2A and data not shown) . Further, significantly increased proliferation of CD8 + lymphocytes in the PBMC of MN184 challenged and LMNC of VR2332 challenged pigs restimulated with MN184 antigens was detected (Fig 2B, Cii and Ciii). In pigs, apart from CD8 + T cells, CD4 + CD8 + T lymphocytes are abundantly present, and they possess memory, activated T-helper and cytolytic properties (32, (35) (36) (37) .

NO' is one of the RNS, and it reacts with oxygen radicals, leading to production of more ROS and RNS. A balance between NO' and ROS will influence the outcome (48).

PBMC were first gated for cells immunostained with R-phycoerythrine-conjugated pig specific CD8 + antibody and then analyzed for CFSE.

In addition, in this study in the lungs of pigs vaccinated and MN184 challenged reduced microscopic lesions, increased proliferation of virus specific CD8 + T cells, and enhanced NO' production were detected. Thus, our results further supported the favorable anti-PRRSV immune responses in the pig lung microenvironment mediated by the adjuvant Mtb WCL to PRRS-MLV.",
