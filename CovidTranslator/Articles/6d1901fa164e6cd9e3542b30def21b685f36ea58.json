            "text": "Since the mid 1980's, an aerogenically spread, respiratory form of TGEV, known as porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), has become very common in Europe and more recently in America and Asia [11, 22, 29, 27] . Under experimental conditions it causes sub-clinical to mild disease but unlike TGEV that is enteric, PRCV appears to replicate predominantly in the cells of the respiratory tract. At the nucleotide level the two viruses are very similar and consequently PRCV has been considered to be a variant of TGEV. There are 2 main differences between PRCV and TGEV genotypes. Firstly, PRCVs have a deletion within the amino-terminal region of the spike protein. Secondly, most PRCVs have deletions of varying sizes, within ORF 3a and/or 3b which render these mRNAs either undetectable or truncated. Comparisons between TGEV and PRCV isolates have thus concluded that both tropism and virulence could be attributed to deletions within the spike and ORF 3 genes [5, 17, 21, 28, 30, 31] . However, recent studies have also shown that the enteric tropism of TGEV can be lost without changes downstream of the spike gene [1] .",

First strand cDNA synthesis and PCR was carried out as described [20] , using RNA extracted from the faeces of one of the above four experimentally infected piglets, and new PCR primers. The PCR primers are shown in Table 1a , and were designed from an alignment of Genbank sequences of TGEV (strains FS772/70, Purdue, and TF1) and canine coronavirus (strain INSAVC-1). Amplified fragments were separated in 1% agarose gels containing 0.2 g/ml ethidium bromide prior to visualisation by UV transillumination. Each specific PCR was performed in triplicate, and the amplicons were pooled and then cleaned using Wizard PCR prep columns (Promega). PCR primers and additional internal primers (Table 1b) were used to sequence the appropriate amplicons in both directions using a FS dye primer kit (Perkin-Elmer). Sequencing reactions were visualised on an ABI 373 automated sequencer (Perkin-Elmer/ABI) through the use of a commercial service (University of Durham, UK). Each fragment was sequenced in its entirety in both directions. The raw data obtained was subsequently edited and aligned to published sequences using GCG and DNAStar (DNAStar Inc.) computer packages. The maximum likelihood method was used to prepare dendrograms of phylogenetic relatedness for each of the different genes that had been sequenced, using the DNAML program from the PHYLIP package [12] . Sequence comparisons indicated that all of the structural genes are TGEVlike. The spike gene (ORF 2, 4350 nucleotides) contains no insertions or deletions compared to that of the 1970 British TGEV isolate FS772/70 [4] . The spike genes of the two viruses show a nucleotide identity of 95.7% corresponding to 185 nt changes and an amino acid identity of 94.5% corresponding to 80 amino acid changes. Just downstream of the spike gene is a series of large deletions that obliterate the transcription signal and start codon of ORF 3a as well as 75% of ORF 3a itself (Fig. 1) . The remaining ORFs from 3b onwards appear to be unaffected by deletions or insertions, other than a 3 nucleotide insertion in the E gene (ORF 4).",

It has been suggested that the widespread occurrence of PRCV provides a measure of cross-protection against TGE. Sequence analysis of TGEVs and PRCVs have shown that the two variants are highly homologous except for two relatively small deleted regions within the PRCV genome. The first involves a 621 -681 nt deletion within the amino-terminal spike gene. The spike gene has been shown to be the receptor binding component of the viral envelope [9, 13] binding to the aminopeptidase N (APN) which is a membrane bound metalloprotease [2, 10] . In addition, the spike gene also has sialic acid acid binding (HA) activity [16, 18] that is lacking in PRCV [25] . This deleted region encompasses amino acids that encode for 2 of the 4 antigenic sites [8] and amino acids that are involved with HA activity [16] and enteropathogenicity [1, 3, 16] . The second difference between TGEVs and PRCVs, involves a number of deletions within ORF 3. In the virulent PRCV strains AR310 and Lepp, ORF 3 is intact except for one nucleotide deletion within 3b, whereas low virulent PRCVs have significantly altered ORF 3s [21] . Similarly for TGEV, a small plaque variant and two cell culture adapted strains that are non-pathogenic, have deletions or insertions that alter ORF 3. Consequently ORF 3 has been postulated as an important determinant for virulence [5-7, 17, 21, 28, 31] .",

Genetic characterization confirmed, as with other TGEVs, that there was no deletion within the spike protein, consistent with the serological findings from the farm. However, a somewhat surprising result was the degree of variation at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels between the spike gene of 96-1933 and other TGEVs and PRCVs. Nearly half of the nucleotide changes resulted in amino acid substitutions compared to the earlier UK isolate FS772/70. Recombination is a major driving force in coronavirus evolution so we compared the 3 3 579 nucleotides of the spike protein from isolate 96-1933 to equivalent sequence from TGEVs, PRCVs and other coronaviruses (canine, feline, and human). Phylogenetic comparison using the 3 3 579 nucleotides of the spike gene, immediately downstream of the deleted region found in PRCVs demonstrated that the closest variant to 96-1933 is the virulent TGEV TF1 (Fig. 2) , although it is still evolutionarily distinct. From Fig. 2 it can be seen that recombination has not occurred between this part of 96-1933 and other related coronaviruses from dogs, cats and humans. Although, sequence data on other structural genes is not available for so many viruses, additional phylogenetic comparisons using ORFs 3b, 4, 5 and 6 were also consistent with this finding (data not shown). Consequently, the origin of the virus is uncertain and requires further investigation.",

            "text": "The size of the deletions affecting ORF 3a is greater than has been reported in other TGEVs or even PRCVs (Fig. 1) . Although deletions in this gene have been suspected to play an important role in viral attenuation [6, 21] , this virus is fully virulent. Therefore, it appears that this ORF is not essential for enteric virulence and that virulence may be determined by more subtle genetic variations. This has recently been shown in part by Ballesteros et al. [1] , where 2 amino acids were shown to be important in the loss of enteric tropism without changes downstream of the spike gene. A possibility remains that the virulence of the 1996 outbreak was due to a standard TGEV that co-circulated with the 96-1933 strain lacking ORF3a. This could not be formally excluded by analysis of plaque purified virus, due to the difficulties in growing the virus in vitro. However, only a single PCR band was observed for the amplicon encompassing ORF3 (data not shown). It has been shown that TGEV is difficult to grow in cell culture [26] especially with strains lacking ORF 3a [21, 30] . This may account for the difficulty of successfully adapting the 96-1933 isolate to growth in cell culture [20] . The remaining ORFs from 3b onwards appear to be unaffected by deletions or insertions, other than a 3 nucleotide insertion in the E gene (ORF 4). This insertion is also found in PRCV isolates RM4 and 86-137004, in the non-pathogenic Purdue strain of TGEV, but not in the virulent TGEV isolates TF1 and FS772/70. The possible significance of this could be addressed by examining this region in other field isolates.",

Approximately 1 year prior to the TGE outbreak in Lincolnshire, serological screening had revealed antibodies to PRCV but not TGEV, suggesting that prior exposure of the herd to PRCV had not proved protective [15] . Subsequent TGE surveillance in England was increased, but further severe outbreaks of disease were not encountered. However, evidence of infection with TGEV was identified in several herds in which there was only mild enteric disease [15, 23] . It may be that the genetic differences in these TGEVs reduce the protection afforded by prior infection with PRCV. Characterisation of these viruses is awaited.",
