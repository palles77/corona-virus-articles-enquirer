This deleterious disease is marked by infiltration of myelinspecific T cells that attack the protective myelin sheath that surrounds CNS nerve axons. Upon demyelination, saltatory nerve conduction is disrupted, and patients experience neurologic deficiencies. The exact cause for MS remains unknown, although most evidence supports the hypothesis that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to disease development. Epidemiologic evidence supports a role for environmental pathogens, such as viruses, as potentially key contributors to MS induction. Pathogens can induce autoimmunity via several well-studied mechanisms with the most postulated being molecular mimicry. Molecular mimicry occurs when T cells specific for peptide epitopes derived from pathogens cross-react with selfepitopes, leading to autoimmune tissue destruction. In this review, we discuss an in vivo virusinduced mouse model of MS developed in our laboratory, which has contributed greatly to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying molecular mimicry-induced CNS autoimmunity.",

This organ-specific autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) is characterized by the loss of the protective myelin sheath surrounding the axons of neurons, resulting in `plaque' formation (2, 3) . Plaques denote areas in which myelin has been lost. Loss of myelin and plaque formation is mainly attributed to myelin-specific CD4 + T cells that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and consequently destroy the myelin sheath (4) (5) (6) . Upon destruction of myelin, saltatory axonal conduction is disrupted leading to loss of neurologic function. Symptoms include cognitive impairment, muscle weakness, spasms, ataxia, and paralysis (7) .",

Outbreaks of MS have also occurred in isolated populations, for example, in native inhabitants of the Faroe and Shetland-Orkney Islands, after prolonged exposure to non-native individuals during World War II (11) (12) (13) . This suggests that the possibility that exposure of genetically susceptible individuals to environmental pathogens may be involved in the induction of MS. More direct evidence for this hypothesis comes from reported isolation of viral proteins and RNA from MS plaques. Overall, over two dozen different viruses have been reportedly linked to MS over the past four decades (14, 15) . Confirmation of the vast majority of these findings is lacking, and more recent reports have correlated MS with infections by human herpes virus type 6 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (16) .",

Immunization induced autoreactive T-cell responses to MBP; however, the animals failed to develop clinical disease (19) . Subsequent studies employed transgenic mice expressing lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), viral antigens expressed in the pancreas under control of the rat insulin promoter. These animals failed to develop spontaneous autoimmune disease, but did develop clinical disease after subsequent LCMV infection (26, 27) . Direct evidence for mimicry-induced autoimmunity was demonstrated upon infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 that leads to autoreactive CD4 + T cells specific for corneal antigen and ultimate development of an autoimmune eye disease (28).",

We employed a very well characterized virus that is studied as one of the primary animals models for MS, i.e. the use of the natural mouse pathogen Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) (29) . TMEV is a singlestranded virus of the picornoviridae family, which is a natural enteric pathogen of mice and rats (30) . TMEV is a neurotropic virus that can replicate and persist within the CNS. Intracerebral infection of susceptible inbred mouse strains (e.g. SJL/J) with wildtype TMEV can lead to the induction of a late-onset demyelinating disease, termed TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) which is similar in pathology to MS, via the process of epitope spreading (17, 31) . In contrast, disease-resistant mouse strains (e.g. C57BL/6) rapidly clear TMEV infection and develop no apparent CNS clinical manifestations.",

The DA strain is less virulent and results in a demyelinating disease approximately 140-180 postinfection (PI) (30) . In our current model, we have employed the BeAn strain which results in chronic demyelinating disease with onset of paralytic symptoms approximately 30-40 days PI in SJL/J mice (30) . TMEV is classically characterized by two disease phases: early acute and late chronic demyelinating disease. Infection of both susceptible and resistant mouse strains induces an early acute disease marked by viral replication in the gray matter of the CNS that generally does not lead to clinical signs (30) . Anti-virus immunity is marked by CNS infiltration of CD4 + T cells specific to viral proteins, as well as a virus-specific CD8 + cytotoxic Tlymphocyte (CTL) response in both the CNS and periphery.

            "text": "In the TMEV-IDD susceptible SJL/J strain, early acute infection results in an ineffectual immune response that limits peripheral virus titers, but does not result in complete virus clearance. Inability to effectively clear the virus results in chronic CNS viral infection, with low viral titers detected for as long as a year or more PI. Typically, replication occurs in CNS-resident antigen-presenting cells and glial cells of the CNS (30, 32) . TMEV-IDD is thought to be initiated by the bystander CNS damage mediated by pathogenic proinflammatory virus-specific CD4 + T cells, as evidenced by the fact that susceptibility is correlated with high class-II-restricted TMEV-specific delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) (33) . In addition, in vivo depletion of CD4 + T cells in SJL mice resulted in decreased incidence of demyelinating disease and slower progression (34) . In the SJL/J strain, immunodominant CD4 + T cells are specific for the TMEV epitope VP2 70-86 (35) . Subimmunodominant epitopes include VP1 233-250 (36) and VP3 [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] (37) . Relevant to a potential role for molecular mimicry in inducing TMEV-IDD following infection with the wildtype BeAn virus strain in SJL/J mice, there appears to be no cross-reactivity between the immunodominant TMEV CD4 epitopes and the immunodominant epitopes on PLP or other myelin proteins, including MBP and MOG (31) , thus mimicry appears not to be involved in disease initiation in wildtype virus infection.",

Inflammation and demyelination were observed in the lower lumbar spinal cord of these animals. This increased pathology was quite striking and was the first evidence that a self-epitope processed from whole virus could be presented to autoreactive T cells resulting in initiation of demyelinating disease. Significantly, it should be noted that innate signals provided by TMEV, a positive strand RNA virus, were sufficient to induce the early onset `EAE-like' disease and did not require exogenous priming with other TLR agonists [e.g. complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) containing Mycobacteria]. Mice infected with a TMEV variant encoding a 30-mer expressing the non-self OVA 323-339 epitope (OVA323-TMEV) failed to develop early onset disease due to molecular mimicry (Fig. 2, Group 3) . However, these mice developed delayed onset spastic hind limb paralysis similar to SJL/J mice infected with wildtype TMEV. It was found that insertion of the OVA 30-mer into the leader deleted \u0394ClaI virus restored CNS viral persistence consistent with this clinical finding (29) . One potential explanation for restoration of virus persistence is a potential conformational change in \u0394ClaI-TMEV upon insertion of the OVA 30-mer which promotes viral replication and CNS persistence. In fact, it was found that all strains which received insertions of 30-mer peptides were able to persist in the CNS and lead to late stage disease.",

Importantly, we determined that route of infection with these particular mutant viruses did not affect clinical disease outcome, in that infection by either the intravenous or intraperitoneal routes resulted in similar disease induction (29, 44) . This is important because it suggests that infections of the periphery (and activation of peripheral T cells) can lead to autoimmunity within the CNS -a site distal from the initial infection. To determine whether infection of the CNS target organ was required for induction of infectioninduced molecular mimicry disease, we inserted PLP 130-159 into Coxsackie virus B3 (PLP139-CVB3), which infects the heart and pancreas, but not the CNS. SJL/J mice infected with PLP139-CVB3 develop early onset mild demyelinating disease (Fig. 2B , Group 6) and concomitant activation of PLP 139-151 -specific CD4 + T-cell responses (unpublished), indicating that virus infection distal to the CNS target organ was sufficient to induce activation of myelin peptide-specific T cells via molecular mimicry, which can home to the CNS.",

Tolerance to the self-myelin peptide significantly reduced clinical disease in mice infected with the H. influenza mimic-encoding virus concomitant with a reduction in PLP 139-151specific DTH and proliferative responses (52) .

A discrepancy exists between the appearance of cross-reactive PLP 139-151 CD4 + T cells and disease severity. Although cross-reactive T cells exist, the disease is mild and non-progressing. Potential explanations for this phenomenon include binding efficiency of the HI peptide, as well as differences in cross-reactive populations of T cells. First, it has been described that the I-A s molecule has lower affinity for the HI 574-586 peptide than for PLP [139] [140] [141] [142] [143] [144] [145] [146] [147] [148] [149] [150] [151] . Therefore, in vivo processing, presentation of this peptide (from the larger virus protein) by endogenous APCs may induce suboptimal priming of cross-reactive CD4 + T cells. A secondary hypothesis could be explained by differences in the PLP 139-151 and HI 574-586 -specific CD4 + T-cell populations. The PLP 139-151 T-cell population cross-activated in HI-TMEV infected mice may be less skewed toward a pathologic Th1/17 phenotype and/or include a regulatory phenotype. Therefore, the balance between harmful and protective T cells may be tipped such that disease progression is controlled. Further exploration of this secondary hypothesis would be interesting to determine if such a relationship exists.",

We thus carried out studies comparing the ability to induce EAE using infection-induced molecular mimicry operating via virus delivered innate immune signals versus peptide/CFA. An important aspect of the studies was the comparison of infection with HI574-TMEV to priming with HI 574-586 in CFA. As described, mice infected with TMEV expressing the HI 574-586 sequence developed a reproducible early onset yet mild clinical disease; however, mice primed with HI/CFA did not develop clinical disease (51, 52, 56) . This indicates that innate immune events associated with viral replication (cytokine production, activation of APCs, TLR/PKR signaling) were required for disease initiation, while priming with this mimic in CFA is insufficient in generating disease. Interestingly, although HI 574-586 /CFA priming failed to invoke clinical disease, PLP 139-151 -specific T-cell proliferation was observed, as well as a DTH response 14 days PI. However, the self-peptide-specific T cells produced significantly less IFN-\u03b3 than animals primed with PLP 139-151 /CFA (51, 52) . Perhaps `lack of skewing' toward pathogenic Th1 or perhaps Th17 cells could explain the inability to develop disease.

            "text": "Our studies indicate that molecular mimicry is a viable explanation for the induction of a wide variety of autoimmune diseases that have been shown to have both a genetic predisposition and are associated with environmental influences. Given the wide genetic diversity of individuals displaying a particular autoimmune disease, it is highly unlikely that any one infectious agent will be found to be exclusively associated with a disease. Depending on the genetics of the individual, it is possible that an autoimmune disease could be triggered by a variety of infectious agents contingent on many variables. These variables could include the number of potential cross-reactive epitopes encoded by the pathogen, the ability of the infectious agent to activate the innate immune system via stimulation of pattern recognition receptors, such as TLRs, the cellular/tissue tropism of the agent, the route of infection, and the age and immune repertoire of the affected individual at the time of infection. Significantly, progression of mimicry-induced autoimmune disease can be mediated by additional mechanisms, including epitope spreading, thus these two potential mechanisms for initiation of infection-induced autoimmune disease are not mutually exclusive. In conclusion, much still remains to be learned about the interaction of genetics, environment, and immune effector function/regulation in the induction and progression of autoimmune disease. (A). Bystander activation. Chronic viral infection leads to activated lymphocytes that secrete inflammatory mediators mediating tissue damage. Once tissue is damaged, self-epitopes are released into the milieu, presented by APCs to autoreactive T cells which can mediate further tissue damage. (B). Epitope spreading. T-cell responses `spread' from virus-specific to self-specific after continuous inflammation in a chronic virus setting. As tissue is destroyed, self-epitopes are released and present to T cells by APCs, which can mediate further damage to the tissue. Upon further tissue destruction, increasing self-epitopes are released and can be presented and activate naive autoreactive T cells. (C). Molecular mimicry. Tissue damage is mediated by autoreactive T cells that become activated after cross-reacting with viral epitopes presented by APCs. Amino acid sequences of MBP 85-99 and its bacterial mimics Boldface indicates residues shared with the self-human myelin basic protein epitope. Residues 5 and 8 are primary MHC contact residues; residues 6, 7, and 9 are primary TCR contact residues (63).",
