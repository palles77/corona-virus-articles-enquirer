AD is the fifth leading cause of death in people older than 65 years of age, representing 71,600 deaths per year. AD affects approximately 5.4 million individuals in the United States and is estimated to affect up to 16 million by 2050 [2] .

Only 20-30% of patients with dementia respond appropriately to conventional drugs, and the onset of adverse drug reactions imposes the need for other drugs to neutralize side effects, thus multiplying the initial cost of the pharmacological treatment and the health risk for the patients [7] . Wimo et al. [8] studied the economic impact of dementia in Europe in the EU-funded Eurocode project and found that the total cost of dementia in EU27 countries in 2008 was estimated to be \u20ac160 billion (\u20ac22,000 per dementia patient per year), of which 56% were costs of informal care. The corresponding costs for the whole of Europe were \u20ac177 billion. Informal caregiver costs were the largest cost component, accounting for about half to just over 60% of total societal costs, depending on the country and AD severity [9] .",

In parallel, a growing body of fresh knowledge is emerging on the pathogenesis of dementia, together with data on the neurogenomics and pharmacogenomics of CNS disorders. The incorporation of this new armamentarium of molecular pathology and genomic medicine into daily medical practice, together with educational programs for the correct use of drugs, must help researchers and clinicians to (1) understand AD pathogenesis; (2) establish an early diagnosis; and (3) optimize therapeutics either as a preventive strategy or as formal symptomatic treatment [7, 12] .",

Improvement in terms of clinical outcome, however, has fallen short of expectations, with up to one-third of patients continuing to experience clinical relapse or unacceptable medication-related side effects in spite of efforts to identify optimal treatment regimes with one or more drugs.

Mendelian mutations affect genes directly linked to AD, including 32 mutations in the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) gene (21q21)(AD1), 165 mutations in the presenilin 1 (PSEN1) gene (14q24.3)(AD3), and 12 mutations in the presenilin 2 (PSEN2) gene (1q31-q42) (AD4) [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . PSEN1 and PSEN2 are important determinants of \u03b3-secretase activity responsible for proteolytic cleavage of APP and NOTCH receptor proteins. Mendelian mutations are very rare in AD (1:1000). Mutations in exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene appear with a frequency of 0.30% and 0.78%, respectively, in AD patients. Likewise, PSEN1, PSEN2, and microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAPT)(17q21.1) mutations are present in less than 2% of cases. Mutations in these genes confer specific phenotypic profiles to patients with dementia: amyloidogeneic pathology associated with APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 mutations and tauopathy associated with MAPT mutations represent the two major pathogenic hypotheses for AD [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

Resident microglia fail to trigger an effective phagocytic response to clear A\u03b2 deposits, although they mainly exist in an \"activated\" state. Oligomeric A\u03b2 (oA\u03b2) can induce more potent neurotoxicity when compared with fibrillar A\u03b2 (fA\u03b2). A\u03b2 fibrils, not A\u03b2 oligomers, increase microglial phagocytosis [51] .

The abnormal production of inflammatory factors may accompany the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia.

More than 25% of patients exhibit high GGT activity, 5-10% show anemic conditions, 30-50% show an abnormal cerebrovascular function characterized by poor brain perfusion, and more than 60% have an abnormal electroencephalographic pattern, especially in frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, as revealed by quantitative EEG (qEEG) or computerized mapping [7, 12, 23, 54] . Significant differences are currently seen between females and males, indicating the effect of gender on the phenotypic expression of the disease. In fact, the prevalence of dementia is 10-15% higher in females than in males from 65-85 years of age. All of these parameters are highly relevant when treating AD patients, because some of them reflect a concomitant pathology that also needs therapeutic consideration.",

Carrying the APOE-\u03b54 allele was associated with a significant decrease in CSF A\u03b2 1-42 concentrations in middle-aged and older subjects. In AD, A\u03b2 1-42 levels are significantly lower in APOE\u03b54 carriers compared to noncarriers. These findings demonstrate significant age effects on CSF A\u03b2 1-42 and pTau181 across the lifespan, and also suggest that a decrease in A\u03b2 1-42 , but an increase in pTau181 CSF levels, is accelerated by the APOE\u03b54 genotype in middleaged and older adults with normal cognition [73] .",

The removal of \u03b2-amyloid, or the prevention of its buildup, has the potential not only to correct \u03b2-amyloid-related toxicity, but also to prevent the formation of neurofibrillary tangles l Conformational changes of endogenously occurring proteins and the formation of insoluble aggregates are commonly associated with neurodegeneration and brain disease, so the removal or prevention of these pathologic protein aggregates is also a therapeutic goal in the principle of immunotherapy l Immunotherapy works in experimental animals and in initial clinical trials: both active immunization and passive antibody transfer consistently reduce brain \u03b2-amyloid load, improve \u03b2-amyloid-related memory impairments, and protect neurons against degeneration in many independent experiments using different mouse models and primates [90] Since A\u03b2 immunotherapy has a limited clearance effect of tau aggregates in dystrophic neurites, the development of an alternative therapy that directly targets pathological tau has become crucial. Increased levels of tau oligomers have been observed in the early stage of AD, prior to the detection of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) formed by aggregation and accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau [92] . Several approaches have been taken to treat AD by targeting tau, such as the following:",

This result reinforces the notion that the immune-conjugate approach is an effective means of A\u03b2 immunotherapy, and also that the entire A\u03b2 peptide is not necessary for its efficacy. It is in accordance with the hypothesis that specific antibodies directed against the amino-terminal and/or central region of the amyloid peptide provide beneficial protection against amyloid pathology.

            "text": "CYP2D6 is a 4.38 kb gene with 9 exons mapped on 22q13.2. Four RNA transcripts of 1190-1684 bp are expressed in the brain, liver, spleen, and reproductive system, where 4 major proteins of 48-55 kDa (439-494 aa) are identified. It is a transport enzyme of the cytochrome P450 subfamily IID or multigenic cytochrome P450 superfamily of mixed-function monooxygenases. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids. CYP2D6 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and is known to metabolize as many as 25% of commonly prescribed drugs, and more than 60% of current psychotropics. Its substrates include debrisoquine, an adrenergic-blocking drug; sparteine and propafenone, both antiarrhythmic drugs; and amitryptiline, an antidepressant. CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic in the population. There are 141 CYP2D6 allelic variants, of which -100C > T, -1023C > T, -1659G > A, -1707delT, -1846G > A, -2549delA, -2613-2615delAGA, -2850C > T, -2988G > A, and -3183G > A represent the ten most important [113] [114] [115] . Different alleles result in the extensive, intermediate, poor, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes, characterized by normal, intermediate, decreased, and multiplied ability to metabolize the enzyme's substrates, respectively. The hepatic cytochrome P450 system is responsible for the first phase in the metabolism and elimination of numerous endogenous and exogenous molecules and ingested chemicals. P450 enzymes convert these substances into electrophilic intermediates, which are then conjugated by phase II enzymes (e.g., UDP glucuronosyltransferases, N-acetyltransferases) to hydrophilic derivatives that can be excreted. According to the database of the World Guide for Drug Use and Pharmacogenomics [113] , 982 drugs are CYP2D6-related: 371 are substrates, more than 300 are inhibitors, and 18 are CYP2D6 inducers.",

On average, approximately 6.28% of the world's population belongs to the PM category. Europeans (7.86%), Polynesians (7.27%), and Africans (6.73%) show the highest rate of PMs, whereas Orientals (0.94%) show the lowest [116] . The frequency of PMs among Middle Eastern populations, Asians, and Americans is in the range of 2-3%. CYP2D6 gene duplications are relatively infrequent among Northern Europeans, but in East Africa the frequency of alleles with duplication of CYP2D6 is as high as 29% [119] .

Oligomer binding involves the C-terminal domain of ApoE, with ApoE3 reporting a much greater response through this conformational marker. ApoE3 displays a higher affinity and capacity for the toxic A\u03b2 oligomer. ApoE polymorphism and AD risk can largely be attributed to the reduced ability of ApoE4 to function as a clearance vehicle for the toxic form of A\u03b2. MAPT and APOE are involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of AD, and both the MAPT H1/H1 genotype and the APOE \u03b54 allele lead to a more rapid progression to dementia among MCI subjects, probably mediating an increased rate of amyloid-\u03b2 and tau brain deposition [27] .",

Both are necessary in CNS disorders and dementia to cope with efficacy and safety issues associated with current psychotropics and antidementia drugs, as well as new CNS drugs. With regard to the future of pharmacogenomics as a practical discipline, several issues should be addressed: l The education of physicians in medical genomics and pharmacogenomics is fundamental (less than 2% of clinicians are familiar with genomic science) l Genomic screening of gene clusters involved in pharmacogenomic outcomes must become a clinical routine (without genetic testing, there is no pharmacogenetics) l Each patient must be a carrier of a pharmacogenetic card [140] indicating what kind of drugs he/she can take and which medications he/she should avoid l Regulatory agencies should request pharmacogenetic data from the pharmaceutical industry when applying for drug approval l Pharmacogenetic data must be incorporated into patient information leaflets and the pharmaceutical vade mecum l New guidelines for daily praxis, such as those given in the World Guide for Drug Use and Pharmacogenomics [113] , will promote understanding of the relationship between drugs and genes to make drug prescription truly personalized",

Current pharmacological treatment of AD with cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) and memantine is not cost-effective; moreover, the overuse of psychotropic drugs in patients with dementia contributes to deteriorating cognitive and psychomotor functions.",

New treatments are oriented to halting disease progression by interfering with A\u03b2 accumulation, NFT formation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and cerebrovascular damage. Over the past few years diverse candidate drugs have been investigated in AD models, but not one has reached the market. Since only 25-30% of the population is an extensive metabolizer for drugs metabolized via CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 enzymes, it seems reasonable to use pharmacogenomic procedures as a way to optimize AD therapeutics, thus reducing ADRs and unnecessary costs. The therapeutic response to conventional drugs in patients with AD is genotype-specific, with CYP2D6-PMs, CYP2D6-UMs, and APOE-4/4 carriers shown to be the worst responders. APOE and CYP2D6 may cooperate, as pleiotropic genes, in the metabolism of drugs and hepatic function.",
