Thirdly, the effects of various immunization schemes including uniform immunization, targeted immunization and acquaintance immunization are studied, and the optimal vaccination strategy is analyzed by Pontryagin's maximum principle. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to verify these theoretical results.",

            "text": "Vaccination is one of the most effective public policies to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases [7, 8] . Since Kermack and Mckendrick established the Susceptible Infected Removed (SIR) model of plague in 1927 [9] and Susceptible Infected Susceptible (SIS) model in 1932 [10] , respectively, more and more epidemic models of infectious diseases with vaccination have largely focused on the standard SIS model. In 2000, Kribs-Zaleta and Velasco-Hern\u00e1ndez [11] put forward an SIVS model with multiple endemic states which exhibited a backward bifurcation for some parameter values and presented a complete analysis of its behavior. Thereafter, many researchers considered various cases based on this model, such as nonlinear incidence rate [12] , age of vaccination [13] , spatial dispersal of individuals [14] , and state-dependent pulse vaccination [15] . However, the basic assumption for the above works is that individuals in each compartment are homogeneously mixed. There are a few developments on the case of heterogeneously mixed. In 2013, Peng et al. extended the SIVS model to Watts-Strogatz small world, Barab\u00e1si-Albert scale-free, and random scale-free networks and made numerical analysis in detail [16] . In 2016, Peng et al. studied the combination of human behavior and demographics and put forward adaptive SIVS models on networks [17] . But the dynamic analysis and control strategy were excluded from these works. Recently, Chen et al. added the quarantined compartment to the SIVS model on scale-free networks and presented the global dynamics [18] .",

Suppose a scale-free network with N nodes is established and all individuals are spatially distributed on this network, each node is occupied by one individual. The connectivities of nodes in network at each time are assumed to be uncorrelated. In an epidemic spreading process, every node has three optional states: susceptible, infected and vaccinated. In order to account for the heterogeneity of contact patterns, it is needed to consider the difference of node degrees. Let S k (t), I k (t), and V k (t) denote the densities of susceptible, infected, and vaccinated individuals with degree k at time t, respectively. For any k and t, S k (t) + I k (t) + V k (t) = 1.

The stop condition is relative error = 0.001. Besides parameter values and initial conditions set in Table 1 , D k = 10 and W k = 0.01 are adopted, k = 3, 4, . . . , 198. Figures 3a, b and 4c , d show the optimal control \u03d5 * k (t) for different degrees k in the cases of R 0 > 1 and R 0 < 1, where k is taken as 3, 20, 35, 50, 75, 97, 118, 146, 163, 198 . From the four subfigures, it can be observed that the optimal control \u03d5 * k (t) increases with the degree k increasing in most of the interval. Figures 3a 1 , b 1 and 4c 1 , d 1 indicate the comparison of the average infected density I (t) with optimal controls (\u03d5 k (t) = \u03d5 * k (t)), with \u03d5 k (t) = 0.04, and without optimal controls (\u03d5 k (t) = 0), where \u03b2 = 0.015 for Fig. 3 and \u03b2 = 0.0007 for Fig. 4 . In Fig. 3a 1 , b 1 , R 0 = 20.6244 and 8.8508 correspond to \u03d5 k (t) = 0 and 0.04; hence, the infection persists. Nevertheless, once effective vaccination is applied, the disease will be controlled and die out ultimately. In the face of global prevalence, great efforts must be made to control propagation during a given period. To minimize both the infected density and control cost, the optimal controls \u03d5 * k (t) decrease with fixed degree k during almost entire evolution and increase with the degree k increasing at fixed time. It is well understood that if a large fraction of susceptible are vaccinated, the possibility of the outbreak of an infectious disease will be reduced apparently. On the other hand, the infection will fade out gradually without any containment, as demonstrated in Fig. 4c 1 , d 1 , where R 0 = 0.9625 < 1. So long as the vaccination is performed, the survival of the disease will be greatly reduced.",

Here, we only consider the value of D k : W k does not change with the degree k. Figure 5 provides the effect of the value change of D k : W k on I (t) with \u03d5 * k (t). In Fig. 5a , b, the infected rate \u03b2 = 0.015 and the basic production number R 0 > 1. The pink and red lines are demarcations. In Fig. 5a , for D k : W k \u2265 1 : 0.011, the average density I (t) of the infected individuals decreases progressively in the interval [0, T ]; that is, the disease can be controlled effectively; for 1 : 0.011 < D k : W k < 1 : 2.65, the disease can be controlled in a period of time first and become increasingly prevalent finally; for D k : W k \u2264 1 : 2.65, the average density I (t) always increases in [0, T ]; that is, the disease is out of control. In Fig. 5b , the analysis is analogous with Fig. 5a. Figure 5c , d shows the effect of the value D k : W k on the average density I (t) for R 0 < 1, where \u03b2 = 0.0007. We present the ratios of D k : W k to control the disease till 0.2T, 0.25T, 0.4T, 0.5T. In Fig. 5c , those ratios are 1 : 0.02, 1 : 0.45, 1 : 3.7, 1 : 9.6 corresponding to 0.2T, 0.25T, 0.4T, 0.5T, respectively.

Since the first two are monotone increasing and the last two are strictly decreasing, there exists a large positive integer K such that for l \u2265 K :It is clear that(26) Noting that 0 < \u03be l < 1 l , one has \u03be l \u2192 0 as l \u2192 \u221e. For the six sequences of (20)-(25), direct computations as j \u2192 \u221e and l \u2192 \u221e lead toSubstituting (29) into (27) and (30) into (28), respectively, one obtainsSubtracting the above two equations, we can getThe condition R 1 \u2264 1 implies that H = h, which is equivalent to X k = x k and Y k = y k for k = 1, . . . , n. Therefore, from (26), it follows that lim t\u2192\u221e I k (t) = X k = x k , lim t\u2192\u221e V k (t) = Y k = y k , k = 1, . . . , n.In view of (4)- (7) and (27)-(32), it is found that X k = I * k , Y k = V * k , and H = h = * . Since S k = 1\u2212 I k \u2212V k for any k, lim t\u2192\u221e S k = 1 \u2212 I * k \u2212 V * k = S * k . This completes the proof.",
