Rabies glycoprotein was also tough to express at sufficient level in soluble form in both E. coli and plant. The present work was aimed to over-express and purify this membrane protein from soluble extract of E. coli. Fusion of Small Ubiqutin like Modifier (SUMO) with rabies glycoprotein increased *1.5 fold higher expression and *3.0 fold solubility in comparison to non-fused in E. coli. The SUMO fusion also simplified the purification process. Previously engineered rabies glycoprotein gene in tobacco plants provides complete protection to mice, but the expression was very low for purification. Our finding demonstrated that the SUMO-fusion was useful for enhancing expression and solubility of the membrane protein and again proves to be a good alternative technology for applications in biomedical and pharmaceutical research.",

Rabies virus genome encodes five major proteins-nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) [3, 5] . The rabies glycoprotein (G) plays an important role in viral pathogenesis and functions as a protective antigen [28] . Rabies virus surface glycoprotein gene (rgp) was engineered and transformed in tobacco plants previously in our laboratory. This gives complete protection to mice against the live virus challenge and provides a foundation for plant based vaccine [1] . However, the expression was very low which make it an intricate task to purify in functionally active form in sufficient quantity from the plant. There is a need of milligram quantities of rabies glycoprotein (RGP) in its native form to understand its physical properties which remains unclear previously.",

            "text": "Covalent modification of cellular proteins by the ubiquitinlike modifier SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) regulates various cellular processes, such as nuclear transport, signal transduction and stabilization of proteins. Ubiquitin-like proteins fall into two classes: the first class, ubiquitin-like modifiers (UBLs) functions as modifiers in a manner analogous to that of ubiquitin. Examples of UBLs are SUMO, Rub1 (also called Nedd8), Apg8 and Apg12. Proteins of the second class include parkin, RAD23 and DSK2, are designated as ubiquitin-domain proteins (UDPs) [2, 9] . These proteins contain domains that are related to ubiquitin but are otherwise unrelated to each other. In contrast to UBLs, UDPs are not conjugated to other proteins. Once covalently attached to cellular targets, SUMO regulates protein: protein and protein: DNA interactions, as well as localization and stability of the target protein. Sumoylation occurs in most eukaryotic systems and SUMO is highly conserved from yeast to humans. SUMO has an apparent molecular weight of *12 kDa. SUMO and ubiquitin show about 18% homology only, but both possess a common three-dimensional structure characterized by a tightly packed globular fold with b-sheets wrapped around the a-helix [11, 17] .",

SUMO fused with proteins of interest dramatically enhances the expression and promotes solubility by helping in correct folding of the proteins. It is known that ubiquitin exerts chaperoning effect on fused proteins in E. coli and increases their yield and solubility [12] . The solubilizing effect of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins was also explained in part by the outer hydrophilicity and inner hydrophobicity of the core structure of ubiquitin and SUMO, exerting a detergent-like effect on otherwise insoluble proteins [2, 9, 17] . The presence of a highly soluble fusion tag also enables increased soluble expression of protein products (up to 50% of the total protein) in E. coli, thereby preventing product aggregation or the formation of inclusion bodies [25] . In addition, toxicity of soluble expression products against the host microorganisms is often prevented when using a fusion partner, as was earlier noticed by our group during ASAL (garlic leaf lectin) expression and purification [27] .",

This also requires an efficient expression and purification process. This process can be accelerated using fusion technology. Membrane proteins such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) protease and 5-lipoxygenaseactivating protein (FLAP) [31] have successfully been expressed and purified using fusion technology. Thus, we cloned SUMO fragment and constructed an expression cassette containing SUMO-rgp to utilize this fusion system to increase the expression level of difficult to express rabies glycoprotein in soluble and active form. In this study the SUMO fusion enhanced the solubility as well as simplified the purification of rabies glycoprotein from E. coli.",

The disease spreads through domestic and wildlife animals. Rabies is a major zoonosis of significant public health concern in many parts of the world, especially in developing countries where rabies is endemic among dogs [18] . The first rabies vaccine [21] , consisted of subcutaneous inoculation of spinal cord suspension, derived from rabid rabbits. Since then, a continuous effort is going on for the improvement of the vaccine [22, 23] . The virus genome encodes five major proteins of which the G-protein of rabies virus has been identified as the major viral antigen that induces protective immunity [6] . In recent years, plants are emerging as a promising alternative to produce safe and effective therapeutic proteins in plants [4, 14, 26] . Recombinant proteins expressed in plants have shown sufficient promise to warrant human clinical trials [26] . In case of rabies glycoprotein, stable expression in tomato plants was reported [16] , while complete protection was also shown when mice were injected with rabies G-proteins expressed and purified from tobacco plants [1] . We need X-ray crystallographic and NMR data to elucidate the structural details of rabies glycoprotein. The prerequisite of such kind of studies are the milligram quantities of glycoprotein and obtaining this much amount of protein from plant bioreactor/mammalian system is a very tough job as it is a membrane protein.",

Although, the glycoprotein expressed in E. coli is non-glycosylated, and doesn't give protection against challenge [13, 30] , yet it is able to induce the IgG production (*1.5 times of negative control; data not shown) in mice, if administered in intra-peritoneum along with adjuvant. An increase in the rabies virus neutralizing antibody titers, after priming with any authentic vaccine and boosting with E. coli expressed, non-glycosylated G-protein has also been reported [24] . The expression and purification of membrane proteins at high levels is an arduous task because the membrane proteins are strongly hydrophobic and they fold incorrectly and may form aggregate, leading to either rapid degradation or accumulation as inclusion bodies. But if the membrane proteins are expressed as a fusion protein, this problem is alleviated up to some extent [31] . Ubiquitin has been reported to have chaperon like activity when fused with some protein. This property of ubiquitin not only increases the expression of fusion protein [2, 19] , but also increases the solubility of fusion protein. SUMO is an ubiquitin like protein consist of approximately 100 AA which is highly conserved in eukaryotes and is not yet b SDS-PAGE profile of induction of pSRGP.

A rationale role of SUMO in facilitating the solubility of insoluble protein is that the inner SUMO core is a dense hydrophobic globular structure and the protein surface is hydrophilic and water soluble which is analogous to amphipathic detergents [2, 15] .",
