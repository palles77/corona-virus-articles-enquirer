Initial diagnosis remains reliant on clinical assessment. To identify features of the clinical assessment that are useful in SARS diagnosis, the exposure status and the prevalence and timing of symptoms, signs, laboratory and radiographic findings were determined for all adult patients admitted with suspected SARS during the Toronto SARS outbreak. Findings were compared between patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS and those in whom SARS was excluded by laboratory or public health investigation. Of 364 cases, 273 (75%) had confirmed SARS, 30 (8%) were excluded, and 61 (17%) remained indeterminate. Among confirmed cases, exposure occurred in the healthcare environment (80%) or in the households of affected patients (17%); community or travel-related cases were rare (<3%). Fever occurred in 97% of patients by the time of admission. Respiratory findings including cough, dyspnea and pulmonary infiltrates evolved later and were present in only 59, 37 and 68% of patients, respectively, at admission. Direct exposure, fever on the first day of illness, and elevated temperature, pulmonary infiltrates, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia at admission were associated with confirmed cases. Rhinorrhea, sore throat, and an elevated neutrophil count at admission were associated with excluded cases. In the absence of fever or significant exposure, SARS is unlikely. Other clinical, laboratory and radiographic findings further raise or lower the likelihood of SARS and provide a rational basis for estimating the likelihood of SARS and directing initial management.",

Cases of SARS due to laboratory or animal exposure have been reported since the global outbreak ended, and these events highlight the importance of prompt recognition of cases in preventing larger outbreaks from occurring [1] [2] [3] . Toronto was the site of the largest SARS outbreak outside of Asia, but previous clinical descriptions of the Toronto outbreak did not include all patients and did not use microbiological methods to classify cases [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . We conducted a retrospective study of the entire Toronto SARS outbreak, using microbiological methods for case classification, to identify epidemiological and clinical findings that may be useful in early diagnosis of SARS.",

Patients were classified as confirmed SARS, indeterminate SARS or excluded SARS based on their exposure history, clinical illness and the results of microbiological testing. Patients were classified as confirmed SARS if they had a compatible clinical illness (fever or nonproductive cough or dyspnea), an exposure to SARS (direct contact with a known SARS case or travel to a SARS-endemic area or time spent at an institution where SARS transmission was occurring, within 12 days of symptom onset), and a positive microbiological test (positive acute or convalescent serology, or positive PCR from clinical or pathological specimens). SARS was excluded in patients that had negative convalescent serology, or when retrospective investigations ruled out an exposure to SARS (e.g. a case where the patient's only exposure to SARS was direct contact with a suspected SARS patient who later was determined to be seronegative). Patients were classified as indeterminate if they had a documented exposure and compatible clinical history, but did not have definitive results from microbiological testing (i.e. convalescent serology was not performed, acute serology was not performed or was negative, and PCR testing was not performed or was negative).",

Although it was not possible to determine the incidence of SARS in the group of 61 indeterminate patients, the incidence of clinical findings in this group tended to be intermediate between those with confirmed and those with excluded SARS, further suggesting that this was a mixed group of SARS and non-SARS cases. Transmission of SARS in the Toronto outbreak was nosocomial in 80% of cases; an additional 17% of patients were exposed at home. Thus, 97% of cases had exposure either to the healthcare system or to an ill contact within the household (often a healthcare worker). Transmission due to travel or exposure within the community was distinctly uncommon.

Fever, although nonspecific, is the central symptom of SARS; it was often the initial symptom of illness, was present at or prior to admission in 97% of cases, and often persisted into the second week of illness. Respiratory symptoms, although a common feature of SARS frequently used in diagnostic algorithms, are often absent initially, rise in incidence over time, and are present in the majority of patients only late in the first week or early in the second week of illness, often after patients have been diagnosed and admitted to hospital.

An approach that combines these findings with an understanding of the incidence and timing of the clinical, laboratory and radiographic findings of SARS will provide the best possible estimate of the likelihood of SARS in individual patients. Our results suggest that, during an evolving SARS outbreak, and in the absence of evidence suggesting widespread transmission within the community, the absence of any direct or indirect exposure to the healthcare system makes a diagnosis of SARS unlikely, while direct exposure to a known case significantly raises the risk of SARS. Although the presence of fever is a nonspecific finding, the absence of a history of fever in a patient presenting to hospital several days after the onset of illness suggests that SARS is unlikely, given that 94% of SARS patients have fever by day 4 of illness, and 97% have fever by admission. On the other hand, the absence of respiratory symptoms or pulmonary infiltrates early in disease does not reduce the likelihood of SARS, as these may be late-onset findings. In some cases, careful follow-up with repeated clinical, laboratory and radiographic assessment can aid diagnosis, and this approach has been demonstrated to be useful [12, 18] . The presence of symptoms common in other infectious illnesses, but uncommon in SARS, is useful in lowering the probability of SARS, i.e., rhinorrhea, Age is reported as median years and the odds ratio is per 10 years of age c Direct exposure is defined as close contact with a known case of SARS within 12 days of symptom onset; indirect contact is defined as travel to a SARS-endemic area or time spent at an institution where SARS transmission was occurring, within 12 days of symptom onset d Laboratory results are presented as the percentage above the normal range for ANC, CK and LDH and as the percentage below the normal range for WBC, ALC and PLT sore throat, productive cough and an elevated absolute neutrophil count are more common in patients without SARS. Features more common in confirmed SARS than in excluded cases included the presence of fever on the first day of illness, documented fever at admission, pulmonary infiltrates at admission, and leukopenia, lymphopenia or thrombocytopenia at admission. The presence of these findings may raise concerns about SARS, but they may be less useful diagnostically as they occur frequently in other conditions that may mimic SARS, such as communityacquired pneumonia [19] . Conversely, their absence lowers the likelihood of SARS, but none as much as the absence of fever at admission, given that the incidence of the other findings in confirmed SARS cases is considerably lower than the incidence of fever at admission.",

Biased or incomplete recording of clinical information could thus affect the accuracy of our results. Patients not admitted to the hospital were not considered. Patients that developed SARS following hospital admission were excluded from the analysis of clinical presentation. Finally, the number of patients in the excluded group was small, limiting our power to detect differences between the confirmed and excluded groups. Despite these limitations, we believe the results of our study are both valid and important. The unexpected emergence of SARS prevented large-scale prospective evaluations from being undertaken in most areas; we are therefore dependent on retrospective data to improve our understanding of SARS, despite the inherent limitations of this approach. Because asymptomatic SARS is rare, transmission has rarely been documented from mildly symptomatic cases, and >90% of seropositive patients identified in Toronto were admitted to hospital, we believe our results are widely applicable [20] [21] [22] . Because the 15 patients that developed SARS during hospitalization were excluded, extrapolation of our data to such patients should be made cautiously. Finally, although the small size of our excluded group suggests that the results of the between group comparisons should be interpreted cautiously, our results are consistent with those of other studies [23] .",
