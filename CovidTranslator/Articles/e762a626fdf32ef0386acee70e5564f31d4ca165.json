Protein is composed of amino acids, and it is the amino acid sequence that determines the chemical structure of protein. Analysis of amino acid sequences can provide useful insights into the tertiary structure of proteins and the reconstruction of evolutionary tree [13, 25, 51, 56] . Phylogenetics is the study of the evolutionary history among organisms. Moreover, it can provide information for function prediction. Some pharmaceutical researchers may use phylogenetic methods to determine species, thus perhaps sharing their medicinal qualities [15] . Traditional phylogenetic approaches based on multiple sequence alignments, such as maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood, become impractical due to their high computational complexity given that most proteomes contain millions of amino acids [11, 23, 31, 50] . Therefore, it is valuable and important to develop novel alignment-free methods for phylogenetic analysis.",

            "text": "In the past two decades, many alignment-free methods have been developed [1, 2, 9, 12, 20-22, 27, 29, 32-45, 54, 55, 57, 58] . These methods are intended to extract some hidden information from protein sequences, but from different angles. Graphical representations of proteins have emerged as one kind of alignment-free methods [1, 9, 20-22, 27, 29, 32-45, 58] . Those methods can make some special useful insights into local and global characteristics and the occurrences, variations and repetition of some special patterns along an amino acid sequence. Alternatively, the compression based methods generally regard the protein sequence as plain text, and define the similarity between two protein sequences as the relative compression ratio [16-18, 28, 53, 56] . These methods will suffer from aggregate errors arising from compression. The third class of methods in the protein phylogenetic analysis attempt to extend single amino acid composition to study string composition for protein sequences where a string is a consecutive segment of amino acids [5, 10, 14, 19, 30, 46] . Hao and Qi [10] , Li et al. [19] , Qi et al. [30] , who analyzed k-word frequencies, then extracted phylogenetic properties on genome-wide scale for prokaryotes. These methods based k-word distribution have to faced the dilemma of the length of word k. Theoretically, one may increase the maximum string length to have finer composition for the whole genomes in order to obtain more accurate pair-wise evolutionary distances. However, increasing string length requires too much memory to be practical as well as increased CPU usage. Ulitsky et al. introduced the average length of longest common substring measure (ACS) based on computing the average length of maximum common substrings. As it is shown that the ACS only concentrates on the length of the longest common word starting at any position in two sequences [8, 47] . Moreover, lengths of other common words also play an important role in the measuring the evolutionary distance between two sequences. Motivated by their work, in this paper, we develop the harmonic distribution for all lengths of common substrings at any position between two sequences. Based on the harmonic distribution, we propose a new alignment-free method for phylogenetic analysis.",

The transferrin (TF) proteins and lactoferrin (LF) proteins are clustered into their corresponding branches in Fig. 1 , while they are mixed together in Fig. 2 and they are far with each other.
