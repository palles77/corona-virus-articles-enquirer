Aim The purpose of this work was to investigate intestinal and peripheral expression of FGL2 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), mainly ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Methods FGL2 expression in mucosal biopsies from three groups (UC group (n = 61), CD group (n = 54), and controls group (n = 35)) was detected by immunohistochemistry. Concentrations of FGL2 in plasma from 50 UC patients, 45 CD patients, and 30 controls were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Western blot of FGL2 protein and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR of FGL2 mRNA expression by peripheral mononuclear cells was performed. Correlations of FGL2 expression with disease type, activity, and location, and with measured laboratory data, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), were examined. Results Intestinal and peripheral FGL2 protein data showed that FGL2 expression was significantly up-regulated in both UC and CD patients compared with controls (P \\ 0.001). Expression of FGL2 was higher in UC and CD patients with active disease than in those with inactive disease (P \\ 0.001). Moreover, FGL2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in patients with active disease than in those with inactive disease (P \\ 0.050). Expression of FGL2 protein was correlated with disease activity indices, CRP levels, and ESR levels. Conclusion Expression of FGL2 was up-regulated in IBD patients with active disease. Measurement of FGL2 may be used as a helpful biomarker for understanding immunopathogenesis and for assessment of IBD.",

Originally described as an immune coagulant with the ability to generate thrombin directly, FGL2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory disorders, including viral hepatitis and experimental arthritis [13, 14] . It has recently been demonstrated that FGL2 is an effector molecule on regulatory T cells (Treg cells) [15] [16] [17] [18] . FGL2 may bind to Fc gamma receptors (FccR), which are expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APC), and then inhibits maturation of dendritic cells (DC) and induces apoptosis of B cells, eventually resulting in reduced ability to induce alloreactive T cell proliferation [16, 19] . All these findings collectively indicate FGL2 has potent immunosuppressant properties.",

The association between FGL2 expression and disease activity indices or other laboratory data, including CRP levels and ESR levels, was examined by non-parametric correlation (Spearman's r). A level of P \\ 0.050 was considered to be statistically significant. (Fig. 3b, c) . Disease location in UC and CD patients was no different.

            "text": "The intestinal lumen is home to more than 500 strains of bacteria, so the GI mucosal immune system must strike a delicate homeostatic balance between maintaining tolerance toward the commensal microflora and remaining poised to mount an aggressive immune response against invading pathogens. Under normal conditions, the epithelial barrier continually samples antigen from the lumen and presents it to lymphocytes in the Peyer's patches to promote tolerance. When it encounters invasion of pathogens, APCs in the mucosa, including macrophages, DC, and intestinal epithelial cells, phagocytose the invading pathogens and present their components to naive CD4? T cells. The T cells then undergo activation and differentiation to an effector phenotype (i.e., Th1, Th2, or Th17) or a regulatory phenotype (i.e., Th3 or Treg) [9] . While effector T-helper cells mount specific immune responses by expression of unique cytokines to combat the invading pathogens, Treg cells suppress inflammation and restore homeostasis to the mucosal tissues by expression of regulatory cytokines, for example interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor (TGF-b). However, there is an inherent defect in the mucosal immune system of IBD patients [6] . Although the exact nature of this defect has not been identified, mounting evidence indicates that IBD occurs in the presence of dubious antigens, most likely normal resident luminal bacterial and/or food-derived, which initiate a dysregulated immune response within the intestinal mucosa and the eventual development of chronic intestinal inflammation [8] . Furthermore, there has been sustained interest in the importance of Treg cells in IBD. It seems that fewer circulating Treg cells are present in patients with active IBD, but insufficiently increased in the intestinal mucosa [24] . Subsequent research suggested the increased apoptosis of Treg cells in IBD can be reversed by anti-TNF-a therapy, and this would be a critical factor in the recurrence of disease [25, 26] . Nevertheless, the clearly core mechanism of Treg-mediated suppression is still controversial. Although IL-10, TGF-b and some other molecules have been reported to account for the regulatory activity of Treg cells, antibodies to these molecules in some cases had no effect or only minimally inhibited Treg cells activity in vitro [27] [28] [29] . Recent findings have revealed the possible importance of the contribution of FGL2 to the suppressive activity of Treg cells [18, 30, 31] . FGL2, consists of 432 aa and contains a C-terminal fibrinogen-related domain (FRED), which is a highly conserved region and is characteristic of proteins within the fibrinogen superfamily [11] . These functionally diverse proteins, including fibrinogen, tenascin, angiopoietin, and ficolin, have been shown to have immunoregulatory activity [32, 33] . Similarly, much research has recently revealed that FGL2, secreted by T cells, also has immunomodulatory activity [17] . FGL2 mRNA increased in CD4?CD25?Foxp3? Treg cells, along with mRNA for several known Treg suppression effector molecules [15, 34] . Furthermore, Shalev et al. [18] reported that the suppressive activity of FGL2-/-Treg cells was significantly impaired in FGL2-/-mice, and antibody to FGL2 completely inhibited the activity of FGL2?/? Treg cells in vitro. Consistent with the contribution of FGL2 to the activity of Treg cells, targeted deletion of the FGL2 gene led to an increase in immune reactivity of DC, T cells, and B cells, and the development of autoimmune glomerulonephritis in aged FGL2-/-mice. The regulatory activity of FGL2 also contributes to inhibition of allograft rejection and the pathogenesis of experimental and human viral infections, including HIV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus [18, 30, 31, 35] . All this evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that FGL2 is an effector molecule of Treg cells. The mechanism whereby FGL2 exerts its immunomodulatory activity has been demonstrated by Liu et al. [19] . FGL2 may bind to FccRIIB, which is expressed on APCs, and then inhibit DC maturation and induce B cells apoptosis, eventually resulting in reduced ability to induce alloreactive T cell proliferation.",

However, our study demonstrated that intestinal and peripheral expression of FGL2 was significantly higher in UC and CD patients with active disease, and decreased in inactive disease. Moreover, expression of FGL2 was positive correlated with disease activity indices, CRP levels, and ESR levels. Up-regulation of FGL2 in both UC and CD patients with active disease may be an insufficient compensation secreted by Treg cells which fails to counter chronically activated effector T cells, and which leads to inappropriate immune responses in IBD. Reduced FGL2 expression in patients with inactive disease may be because successful treatment, including immune modifiers, anti-TNF-a therapy, and other anti-inflammatory treatment, made up for the deficiency of Treg cells, or reversed the deficiency to exert sufficient suppression against other subsets of T lymphocytes through multiple other suppression molecules. This assumption is in agreement with the results of Maul et al. [24] , which reported a decrease of peripheral Treg cells and an insufficient increase in intestinal lesions, and also consistent with therapeutic strategies in which immune modifiers [1] or anti-TNF-a therapy [25] are used.",
