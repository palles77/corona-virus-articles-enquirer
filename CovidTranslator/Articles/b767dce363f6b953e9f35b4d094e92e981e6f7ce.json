At most institutions, febrile information is contained only in free-text clinical records. We compared the sensitivity and specificity of three fever detection algorithms for detecting fever from free-text. Keyword CC and CoCo classified patients based on triage chief complaints; Keyword HP classified patients based on dictated emergency department reports. Keyword HP was the most sensitive (sensitivity 0.98, specificity 0.89), and Keyword CC was the most specific (sensitivity 0.61, specificity 1.0). Because chief complaints are available sooner than emergency department reports, we suggest a combined application that classifies patients based on their chief complaint followed by classification based on their emergency department report, once the report becomes available.",

The ability to detect febrile illness in a community would be valuable in public health surveillance if surveillance could be performed routinely, with sufficient accuracy, and at low cost. For example, an increase in the number or percentage of patients with fever compared to a baseline number could alert public health officials to an outbreak of a known or new disease or to a terroristic threat. Some syndromic surveillance systems classify patients into syndromic categories [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] that include fever in their definitions [5, [16] [17] [18] [19] . Knowledge of the fever status of patients would be particularly helpful when combined with other information about their symptoms or clinical characteristics. For example, knowing the presence of fever is crucial in determining whether a patient has Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [20] [21] [22] . However, to our knowledge no one has measured the accuracy at which fever status can be determined automatically from routinely collected data.",

            "text": "Automatically determining if a patient has a fever from medical records is not straightforward. Very few clinical facilities encode temperature into computer readable format at the time the temperature is taken. In most instances, the only way to determine whether a patient has a fever is from the text written or dictated into the patient\u00d5s medical record. Much of the clinical information is locked in free-text reports and must be automatically extracted to be useful for a real-time surveillance system. Statistical and symbolic text processing techniques have been applied successfully to dictated clinical reports [23] for retrieval of relevant documents [24, 25] , classification of text into discrete categories [26] [27] [28] [29] , and extraction and encoding of detailed clinical information from text [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Applying text processing techniques to the field of biosurveillance is a fairly new area of research in medical informatics that has focused on processing free-text chief complaints recorded in the emergency department [26, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . In this study, we evaluated the performance of three free-text processing algorithms to detect fever from triage chief complaints (Keyword CC and CoCo) and from the text of the pa-tient\u00d5s emergency department report (Keyword HP).",

Patients with chief complaints indicating a fever are currently classified by CoCo as having a constitutional syndrome as are patients who present with nonlocalized complaints typical of many illnesses in their early stages, such as malaise, lethargy, or generalized aches. We applied CoCo to the problem of fever detection to capture two possible scenarios. First, it is possible that some febrile patients presenting to the ED do not yet complain of fever but are experiencing other constitutional symptoms that typically occur with a fever. Second, because chief complaints are short phrases that are designed to represent the most pertinent symptoms rather than to give a complete description of a patient\u00d5s clinical condition, even when a patient reports fever to the triage nurse, a word indicating fever may not be included in the chief complaint. The CoCo algorithm represents a potentially more sensitive algorithm for detecting patients with a fever even though fever is not indicated in the chief complaint. For this study, any patient classified by CoCo as having a constitutional syndrome was considered febrile.",

Still, the majority of the ED reports in our sample contained fever information (96%). Because our sample was enriched with patients having a discharge diagnosis of fever (and none of the patients without information about febrile status in the ED reports came from the enriched sample), a more accurate estimate of the proportion of ED reports without a description of febrile status can be calculated from the non-enriched portion of the sample at 8.4% (9/107).",

If we were to classify patients as febrile if either Keyword CC or CoCo assigned a positive classification, sensitivity would increase to 72.5% (79/109) and specificity would be identical to that of CoCo at 95% (99/104). CoCo\u00d5s classification performance of fever from chief complaints is equal to or better than that reported for classification of patients based on their chief complaints for respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, rash, and botulinic syndromes [36] This report only studies accuracy of classification. Other considerations affect the decision about which type of input data and which classification algorithms are optimal for a surveillance application, including the availability and completeness of the data [24] . There are often tradeoffs to be considered. For example, a chief complaint is available immediately upon admission to an emergency facility, whereas an ED report is not available until the report is dictated by the physician, manually transcribed, and stored on the hospital information system; however, sensitivity of detection from chief complaints is lower than from ED reports.",
