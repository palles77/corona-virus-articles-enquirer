Conventional wisdom suggests that social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible after the beginning of an outbreak. Using a simple epidemiological model we show, however, that there is in fact an optimal time to initiate a temporal social distancing intervention if the goal is to reduce the final epidemic size or \"flatten\" the epidemic curve. The optimal timing depends strongly on the effective reproduction number (R 0 ) of the disease, such that as the R 0 increases, the optimal time decreases non-linearly. Additionally, if pharmacological interventions (e.g., a vaccine) become available at some point during the epidemic, the sooner these interventions become available the sooner social distancing should be initiated to maximize its effectiveness. Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire further investigations within the context of more complex and data-driven epidemiological models, and can ultimately help decision makers to improve temporal social distancing policies to mitigate the spread of epidemics.",

Prompt and strict social distancing measures can help \"flatten the epidemic\" (another fashionable meme at the moment), which in turn will help prevent overwhelming the health system, while also buying us time until effective antivirals and vaccines can be deployed on a mass scale [19] . Implementing swift social distancing measures is one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of the virus, and when the facing a novel and very transmissible virus like COVID-19, social distancing is our first and most effective line of defense. However, is it true that the sooner a temporal social distancing measured is introduced the better health outcomes we will get? The answer to this question would be a resounding \"yes\" if such measures were to last for extended periods of time (i.e., until the epidemic is over or almost over). However, social distancing interventions are seldom extended long enough to drive the epidemic to extinction on its own. In fact, it is known that new epidemic waves can arise after the social distancing measures are lifted if the pool of susceptibles is large enough, as current models suggest [4, 15, 11] , and as it has historically happened in several occasions, including during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic [6] , the 2003 SARS epidemic in Canada [8] , and the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic in Mexico [10] .",

We define\"optimal\" based on three different epidemiologically relevant criteria: optimal timing of social distancing 1) to minimize the final size of the epidemic; 2) to maximize the delay in the peak of the infection incidence curve of the epidemic; and 3) to minimize the peak of the infection incidence curve of the epidemic. The first criteria aims to minimize the impact of the epidemic in terms of overall infections, while the other two refer to the flattening of the epidemic as to not overburden the health system in place to care for infected individuals.",

Individuals are classified based on their infectious status as susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R). The force of infection at time t is given by \u03b2(t)I(t), where \u03b2(t) is the transmission probability. This term is the product of the number of contacts per capita per time unit, c(t), and the probability of transmission given a contact, p; that is \u03b2(t) = c(t)p. The social distancing measure affects the c(t) parameter, such that when social distancing is in effect c(t) is reduced. The corresponding reduction in \u03b2(t) due to a temporary social distancing measure can be modeled as a \"rectangular well\" function, as shown in Figure (1) . From the start of the epidemic until time t 0 (the time at which social distancing is initiated), the transmission rate is \u03b2. From time t 0 to t 0 + T , a social distancing measured is implemented such that the transmission rate is reduced to \u03b2 r = r\u03b2, with 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1, and T being the length of the period when social distancing measures are in place. Then, after time t 0 + T (when social distancing ends), the transmission rate comes back up to \u03b2, until time t I , at which point a fully effective intervention (e.g., vaccine) is applied such that transmission is completed halted (\u03b2 = 0).",

The optimal timing for social distancing is then computed for each value of R 0 and t I . (2)-(3) with different temporal social distancing scenarios. In particular, we explore the impact of different times at which the social distancing measures are implemented (t 0 ) in the disease dynamics and the final epidemic size. From Figure ( 2) (left) we see that if the social distancing is implemented too soon (t 0 = 50 days), then at the end of the social distancing measure (after 30 days) there are still some infected in the population, and the pool of susceptible is large enough for the disease to take off again and still infect a large portion of the population. Conversely, if social distancing is introduced too late (t 0 = 100 days) by the time the epidemic has already largely spread in the population, then there is little the social distancing measures can do to reduce the final epidemic size. In both these cases, social distancing measures were not applied in an optimal manner, time wise. However, if social distancing is initiated at t 0 = 80 then the resulting epidemic is more effectively flattened. These observations are crystalized in Figure ( 2) (right), which suggests that there is in fact an optimal time, t * 0 , to introduce the social distancing so that the final epidemic size is minimized. Moreover, this figure suggests that the t 0 that minimizes the final epidemic size decreases as R 0 increases. That is, the more transmissible the disease is, the sooner social distancing measures should 4 .

This assumption is most often wrong, as treatment options (e.g., vaccines, antivirals) typically become available at some point during the course of the epidemic. Here we explore a model with finite values of t I , and see how the optimal social distancing time varies with t I and R 0 . Figure (7) (left) shows that as t I decreases so does the optimal social distancing time if the goal is to reduce the final size (similar results are obtained if the goal is to flatten the epidemic curve, see Appendix 4) . If the epidemic is only moderately transmissible (e.g., 1 < R 0 < 2) and pharmacological interventions are available relatively quickly (e.g., t I < 200 days), the optimal social distancing should be initiated almost immediately after the start of the epidemic. Intuitively, this result makes sense; if effective interventions become available soon after the start of the epidemic, a large second wave post social distancing is less likely because the intervention would prevent it. Figure (7) (right) shows that the optimal timing for social distancing decreases sharply (particulalrly if the goal is to reduce the final size) as t I decreases, regardless of the epidemic containing strategy being employed. Note that if t I is large enough (i.e., the intervention comes long after the peak of the epidemic with no containing measures [\u223c 90 days, see Figure ( 2) (left)]), then the optimal time stops depending on the value of t I .

The inclusion of transmission or contact level heterogeneities within the population [19] (e.g., age structure) may play a significant role in the quantitative description of the results in this paper, as would the inclusion of seasonality effects. Additionally, since we are using a deterministic mean-field approach, these analyses do not account for the effects of stochastic fluctuations (which could lead to epidemic extinction if the number of infected is low enough during the social distancing phase) and as a consequence, the findings herein apply more closely to very large populations (i.e., in the thermodynamic limit) where stochastic fluctuations are less relevant. Similarly, the model assumes homogeneous mixing among individuals, thus the contact network structure of the population is not accounted for; as a result this model cannot realistically predict the epidemic-hampering effects that social distancing measures (e.g., limiting the size of crowds) have in the context of contact structured populations [20] .",

Early in an epidemic, particularly when in the presence of a novel pathogen like SARS-CoV-2, there is typically a large amount of uncertainty around most epidemiological parameters, especially R 0 [9, 23] . This uncertainty is the result of several factors, including lack of reliable data on the true number of infected, differences in the formulations and assumptions underlying the statistical models used to estimate R 0 , and the geographic heterogeneity of the disease spreading patterns. The uncertainty around the value of R 0 should also be carried over to the estimate of the optimal time for initiating social distancing. Hence, assuming the true R 0 lies within a range (e.g., 95% confidence intervals), the estimation of the optimal t 0 should account for this uncertainty. Moreover, if a (Bayesian posterior) distribution is available for R 0 , then one could also get a distribution for the optimal t 0 , which would in turn allow to compute the probability that the optimal t 0 is within a given range, or lower/higher than a given time of interest (i.e., two weeks from now). Then, it would be up to the decision makers to determine what level of uncertainty is considered acceptable in order to proceed with a given social distancing strategy. Of note, if the level of uncertainty on R 0 is very large and a decision needs to be made promptly, it is arguably better to initiate social distancing sooner, as opposed to later, than the true optimal t 0 ; therefore, a conservative approach could be to assume R 0 is equal to the upper bound of its %95 confidence interval, and compute the corresponding optimal t 0 .",

For all simulations S(0) = .9999, I(0) = 0.001, and \u03b3 = 1/10.For each combination of R 0 , T and r, the value of t 0 corresponding to 1) the minimal final size at 5 years (t * 01 ), 2) the maximum delay in incidence peak time (t * 02 ), and 3) the minimum incidence peak (t * 03 ) was obtained. To quantify the effect of these three versions of optimal social distancing, a base model with no social distancing was also simulated for each combination of R 0 , T and r. The final size reduction assuming optimal SD timing was computed as:1 \u2212 (f inal.size(t * 01 ))/f inal.size(T = 0)).The incidence peak delay assuming optimal SD timing was computed as:peak.time(t * 02 ) \u2212 peak.time(T = 0).The incidence peak reduction assuming optimal SD timing was computed as:1 \u2212 (peak(t * 03 ))/peak(T = 0)).Appendix 3: Effect of optimal t 0 in reducing final epidemic size and flattening the epidemic",
