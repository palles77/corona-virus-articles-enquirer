In three experiments, synergy/additivity was observed at all three ratios and effective levels ( Table S7 ). The results of all three experiments indicate mixed synergy/additivity. These results demonstrate that combination treatment of replicon cells with BMS-790052 and IFN-\u03b1 +/-ribavirin, or inhibitors targeting the HCV NS3 protease or NS5B polymerase, yield additive to synergistic antiviral effects. Importantly, neither antagonism of antiviral activity, nor enhancement of cytotoxicity was observed with any of these combinations.
