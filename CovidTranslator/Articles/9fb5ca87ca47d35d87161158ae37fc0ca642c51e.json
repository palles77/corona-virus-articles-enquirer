Unlike other tissue 54 myeloid populations such as monocytes and macrophages, the resident microglial pool receives 55 no significant replenishment from circulation and is internally maintained by self-renewal ( To examine the transcriptome profiles of the Csf1r inhibitor-resistant microglial population, we 86 performed scRNA-seq on the remaining microglia from C57/BL6J mice that were treated with 87 PLX diet (D0) (Fig. 1A) . To investigate early stage adult newborn microglia, we also included 88 mice that were switched to a control diet for 2 days after PLX treatment (D2) (Fig 1A) . Microglia 89 from age-matched non-treated mice were used as control (Ctrl) (Fig 1A) . Similar to our previous 90 results (Zhan et al., 2019) , oral dosing of 1200 mg/kg PLX in C57/BL6J mice for two weeks 91 resulted 92.93 -96.2% removal of CD11b+ myeloid cells in the CNS (Fig S1) .

Consistent with this population representing proliferative microglia, the relative 150 frequency of cells in Cluster 9 roughly doubled its size from 30% (D0) to 69% in just two days of 151 microglial repopulation (Fig 1N) . 152 Cells in Cluster-6 and Cluster-7 lacked myeloid markers including Cd11b, Csf1r, and Cd14 did 153 not (Fig. S3A) . Instead, Cluster-6 showed high expression of Klrb1c and Nkg7, which are normally 154 found in natural killer (NK) cells (Fig S3D) , while Cluster-7 expressed T-cell markers Ccr7 and 155 Il7r ( Fig S3E) . We then performed microglial lineage mapping using the Cx3cr1-CreERT2 and 156 inducible RFP reporter, and showed that microglia under Csf1r inhibition did not express either 157 the T cell marker CD3 or the NK cell marker Nkg7 (Fig. S4) . Thus, it is unlikely that these are 158 microglia with altered states under Csf1r inhibition. Instead, it is more likely that certain subsets 159 of NK and memory T cells were captured by cd11b-based capture during FACS since they can proliferative, and PLX-resistant ( Fig 3F) . As expected, Clusters-6 and -7 were placed on the PLX-166 resistant branch (Fig 3G) , because lymphocytes were not affected by PLX5622 (Wheeler et al., 167 2018 ). Among the myeloid clusters, Cluster-8 was evenly distributed along the PLX-resistant and 168 proliferative branches, while Clusters-4 and -5 were largely distributed along the PLX-resistant 169 branch ( Fig 3G) . 170",

It starts with the emergence of c-kit+ 41 erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac, known as primitive hematopoiesis, which then influx 42 into the developing parenchyma via circulation (Ginhoux et al., 2010) in an Irf-8, Pu.1-dependent 43 manner (Kierdorf et al., 2013). Seeded microglial progenitors persist in the CNS and continue to 44 expand and mature until adulthood (Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016). In general, developing 45 microglia can be distinguished by well-defined developmental intervals from the yolk sac to the 46 adult, and transcriptional programs associated with each of these stages have been meticulously 47 markers such as Tmem119 (Bennett et al., 2016) and P2ry12",

It is thus not surprising that microglia have an extremely 58 long half-life (Lawson et al., 1992), most recently estimated to be 7.5-15 months in the murine 59 CNS (Fuger et al., 2017; Tay et al., 2017; Zhan et al., 2019). In contrast, other myeloid populations 60 such as classical monocytes have a half-life of less than 24 hours (van Furth and Cohn, 1968; Yona 61 et al., 2013), and require constant replenishment from a Cx3cr1-population in the bone marrow 62 (Fogg et al., 2006). 63 Csf1r signaling is critical for microglial survival and maintenance. Loss-of-function mutation 64 is either of its two natural ligands: Csf1 and IL-34, results in significant reduction of microglia 65 count (Greter et al., 2012; Wegiel et al., 1998). Null mutations in Csf1r remove 99.7% microglia, 66 but a few morphologically distinctive microglia near the hippocampus and piriform cortex remain 67 (Erblich et al., 2011). In addition, the Csf1r inhibitor PLX5622 (PLX) has been widely used as a 68 research tool to acutely remove microglia. While depletion efficiency varies, complete microglial 69 ablation has never been reported (Acharya et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018; Rice et al., 2017; Zhan 70 et al., 2019). These studies suggest that the adult microglial pool includes a population that does 71 not require Csf1r signaling for survival. Remarkably, the microglial pool can be rapidly 72 regenerated after termination of PLX administration. While an earlier study proposed a hidden 73 nestin+ progenitor pool responsible for repopulation (Elmore et al., 2014), we and others found 74 that the remaining microglia were solely responsible for microglial repopulation (Huang et al., 75 2018; Zhan et al., 2019), consistent with the notion that a subpopulation of microglia exhibit 76 progenitor-like features. Our current study applied single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to 77 examine the resilient microglial population after acute Csf1r inhibition with PLX. Among the 78 PLX-resistant microglia were a subpopulation of Mac2+ cells, which were also discovered in the 79 homeostatic microglial pool yet displayed unexpected progenitor signatures. We also examined 80 the role of the Mac2+ microglia during adult microgliogenesis in a Single cell RNA-seq profiling of microglia under Csf1r inhibition and early repopulation 85",

The dramatic increase of the percentage of Mac2+ 184 microglia induced by Csf1r inhibition supports the notion that this subpopulation of microglia are not derived from peripheral monocytes and are highly proliferative 188 Since Mac2 is a galactoside-binding protein expressed in many myeloid cells including monocytes 189 and macrophages (Ho and Springer, 1982), one possibility that Iba1+Mac2+ cells are over-190 represented under Csf1r inhibition could be due to monocytic replenishment from circulation. To 191 test this hypothesis, we performed lineage tracing using the myeloid specific CX3CR1-CreERT2 192 driver (Parkhurst et al., 2013) with an inducible RFP reporter (Luche et al., 2007) (CX3CR1-193CreERT2/STOP flox -RFP). One month after the initial tamoxifen injection, 98% labeled monocytes 194 in circulation are replaced by unlabeled newborn cells, whereas microglia in the brain remain 195 RFP+ due to their extreme longevity(Parkhurst et al., 2013). Using a similar labeling strategy, we 196 examined the lineage of the parenchymal Mac2+ cells(Fig 5A). We reasoned that if the Mac2+ 197 microglia were derived from circulating monocytes/macrophages that lack RFP expression, there 198 would be fewer Mac2+ microglia that express RFP after repeated PLX treatment. Instead, RFP 199 labeling efficiency in the Mac2+ population did not differ after either single (PLX 1X ) or tandem 200 PLX treatment (PLX 2X ) separated by a repopulation period(Fig 5 B-D), indicating that the Mac2+ 201 cells are not derived from circulating monocytes, but rather resident microglia that are internally 202 maintained in the parenchyma. 203We then examined the newborn microglia at day 4 and day 14 after switching mice from PLX 204 diet to the control diet using 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) pulse-chase labeling. To maximize 205 the EdU labeling efficiency, two sequential intraperitoneal injections separated by 7 hours apart 206 were given on repopulation day 3(Fig 5E). In the ectorhinal cortex, we confirmed microglia 207 repopulation(Fig 5F-H)and found that, while a subset of both Mac2+ and Mac2-microglia have 208 incorporated Edu(Fig 5F, G), the number of Iba1+Mac2+ cells increased substantially at 209",

Among the DEGs, early 226 microglial development genes such as Lyz2, Ifit3 (Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016), Mmp8, and 227 Mmp9 (Kierdorf et al., 2013) were significantly upregulated, while mature microglia signature 228 genes such as Tmem119, Mafb, Cx3cr1 and Csf1r (Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016) were 229 downregulated (Fig 6C). 230 To further examine whether the Mac2+ cells resembled immature microglial progenitors 231 during development, we compared the DEGs of Mac2+ cells with the microglial developmental 232 E1/E2, day E10.5 -E14), pre-microglia (Cluster P1/P2, day E14 to postnatal 236 day 9), to adulthood (Cluster A1/A2, >1Mo) (Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016). Remarkably, genes 237 associated with early development were highly enriched among the upregulated DEGs in the 238 Mac2+ cells (Fig 6D). Specifically, 16.36% of genes were those associated with yolk sac (YS) 239 progenitors and 22.60% of the genes were those expressed in early embryonic progenitors (E1), 240 while only around 2% of those expressed in adult microglia (Fig 6D). In contrast, among the 241 downregulated DEGs from Mac2+ cells, 19.64% and 27.09% of them overlapped with the A2 and 242 A1 adult gene signatures respectively (Fig. 6E). As a control for the analysis, we also examined 243 the cells lacking Mac2 expression (Mac2-), which exhibit no progenitor signatures in them (Fig 244 S6). In direct contrast to Mac2+ cells, upregulated DEGs in Mac2-cells showed significant overlap 245 with adult microglia while the downregulated one with yolk sac (Fig S6). 246 We next performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the DEGs in the Mac2+ 247 microglia (Mootha et al., 2003; Subramanian et al., 2005). NF-kb pathway and interferon signaling 248 were highly enriched in the upregulated DEGs (Fig 6F), whereas p53, STAT5, and TGFbeta 249 signaling, a pathway required for microglia homeostasis maintenance (Butovsky et al., 2014; 250 Zoller et al., 2018), was enriched among the downregulated DEGs (Fig 6G). Additional analyses 251 with Wikipathway (Slenter et al., 2018) showed ribosomal protein and macrophage signature 252 genes in the upregulated DEGs, whereas the Tyrobp network and pathogen phagocytosis pathway 253 were the most enriched signature among the downregulated DEGs. As Tyrobp is the progenitor-like cells are present among homeostatic microglia 258We next questioned whether the Mac2+ cells in non-treated ctrl brain also have progenitor-like 259 features. Among all the Mac2+ cell from our scRNA-seq data, 3.01% came from the untreated ctrl 260 C57/BL6J mice(Fig 7A). Mac2+ cells from Ctrl mice exhibited similar upregulation of 261 developmental genes but downregulation of homeostatic markers compared to cluster-1(Fig 7B). 262Specifically, approximately 86.44% upregulated DEGs (Fig 7C)and 93.67% downregulated 263 DEGs (Fig 7D) from the Mac2+ cells in Ctrl brains were found in all Mac2+ cells, suggesting that 264 the properties of Mac2+ cells in the presence or absence of csf1r inhibition are indistinguishable. 265 Indeed, Mac2+ cells from the control brain exhibited similar microglial progenitor signatures with 266 reduced expression of mature microglial markers (Fig 7E, F), further confirming the presence of 267 Mac2+ progenitor-like microglia in adult mouse brain. hippocampus, the Mac2+ microglial sub-population represented 0.68% total microglia and 272 did not require Csf1r signaling for survival. While the Mac2+ microglia shared transcriptomic 273 features similar to those of circulating monocytes, lineage tracing revealed that the Mac2+ 274 microglial population was self-sustained with no replenishment from circulation. Remarkably, the 275 Mac2+ population shared striking similarities with immature microglial progenitors during 276 development. Finally, Mac2+ microglia appeared to be highly proliferative in the ectorhinal region 277 during adult microglial repopulation after acute ablation. Altogether, our data identify a 278 heterogeneous progenitor-like microglial population that is independent of Csf1r survival signal 279 in adult mouse brain. 280 The existence of a Csf1r-independent microglial population in the adult CNS was suggested 281 by previous studies. For example, regardless of the dose and duration of PLX treatment, 1-10% of 282 the microglial population has been observed to survive (Acharya et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018; 283 Rice et al., 2017; Zhan et al., 2019). In Csf1r KO mice, although 99% of Iba1+ microglia are lost 284 in almost all brain regions, 13.9% microglia remain in the hippocampus and 33.7% remain in the 285 piriform cortex (Erblich et al., 2011). During development, although it is well known that myeloid 286 cells require Csf1r signaling for survival, the CD45+c-kit lo microglial progenitors which are found 287 in yolk sac do not start to massively express Csf1r until days post coitum (dpc) 9.0 (Kierdorf et al., 288 2013). Furthermore, expression of Csf1 ligand remains mostly quiescent until yolk sac progenitors 289 reach the brain rudiment at E10.5 (Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016). These findings support",

In particular, Mmp8 and Mmp9, 298 which are required for the migratory expansion during early stage microgliogenesis (Kierdorf et 299 al., 2013) were highly upregulated whereas Mafb, a transcriptional factor required for microglia 300 maturation (Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016) was significantly downregulated. Comprehensive 301 comparison of transcriptomes revealed that Mac2+ microglia in adult brain exhibit significant 302 overlap with those found in yolk sac and in early embryonic development, highlighting the unusual 303 heterogeneity and plasticity of adult microglia. 304Mac2, also known as Galectin-3, is a galactoside binding protein highly expressed in myeloid 305 cells that can be secreted to modulate a wide variety of immune functions(Rahimian et al., 2018). 306Using fate-mapping, we determined that the Mac2+ cells observed under Csf1r inhibition were not 307 of monocytic origin, but represent a subpopulation of microglia. Expression of Mac2 is associated 308with activated microglial state (Lalancette-Hebert et al., 2012). Mac2 is found to promote 309 microglial migration (Wesley et al., 2013). Microglia in Mac2 knockout mice have far less 310 proliferation in response to ischemic lesions (Lalancette-Hebert et al., 2012), suggesting a critical 311 role of Mac2 in modulation of microglial proliferation. Whether depletion of Mac2 diminishes the 312 repopulation microglia following Csf1r inhibition remains to be determined. Interestingly, revealed a progenitor population hidden among other microglia under steady-state. 317 Unlike other terminally differentiated myeloid cells, microglia are sufficiently self-maintained 318 (Ajami et al., 2007; Mildner et al., 2007). Under acute microglial ablation, the 1-10% remaining 319 microglia can restore the entire empty niche (Huang et al., 2018; Zhan et al., 2019), without 320 needing any external progenitor input. However, due to the unusual plasticity of microglia, it still 321 remains unclear whether a specialized adult progenitor is required to maintain microglial 322 homeostasis. It had been proposed that every microglial cell could have the ability to conduct self-323 renewal when needed (Tay et al., 2017). Consistent with this notion, although we found that the 324 Mac2+ cells were highly proliferative during early stage microglial repopulation, a large 325 proportion of proliferating microglia did not express Mac2. And the number of Mac2+ cells 326 returned to ctrl level by D14. The overall contribution of Mac2+ microglia during repopulation is 327 hard to determine with the current approach since Mac2 expression could be very transient, and 328 rapidly turned off once the cell cycle is complete. To determine the overall contribution of Mac2+ 329 cells to microgliogenesis, further lineage tracing studies of the descendants of work was performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use 335 Committee guidelines, at the University of California, San Francisco. Mice, with unrestricted 336 CX3CR1-CreERT2 line (JAX: 021160) and the STOP Flox -RFP line (MGI: 104735). 340 Equal numbers of male and female mice were used for all experiments except for the scmicroglial ablation, mice were administered Csf1r antagonist PLX5622 orally via PLX 345 diet (1200 mg/kg PLX5622, Plexxikon Inc., Berkeley, USA). Control diet (CD) with the same 346 base formula was used as control. For lineage mapping, tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, T5648) was 347 dissolved in corn oil and administered to the CX3CR1-CreERT2/STOP Flox -RFP mice by 348 intraperitoneal (I.P.) injection for 10 days at a daily dose of 2 mg. To label proliferative cells, a 349 solution containing 20 mg/mL 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) (Santa Cruz, sc-284628) was 350 prepared fresh in sterile PBS and given to mice via I.P. injection at a dose of 80 mg/kg per animal. 351 To maximize EdU labeling, two injections, separated by 7 hours, were given on the same day 352 (Repopulation day 3). To detect EdU-labeled cells in brain sections, Click-iT\u2122 EdU imaging kits 353 (ThermoFisher Scientific, C10337) were used following the manufacturer's instructions before the 354 immunofluorescence staining procedures. 355 356 Tissue preparation for microglia isolation 357 Four female mice (1 for Ctrl, 2 for D0, 1 for D2) were perfused with PBS transcardially to remove 358 circulating blood cells in the CNS. Whole brain was then dissected, with the cerebellum removed, 359 Thermofisher, 15575020) and 1% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, 10082147). The homogenates 363 were kept at 4\u00b0C for all downstream applications. The homogenates were then processed for 364 myelin depletion using myelin removal beads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-096-733) and passed through 365 LD column (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-042-901). The myelin-depleted fraction was then used microglia purification via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) 369 To perform immune labeling, myelin-depleted cell suspensions were incubated with TruStain fcX 370 (BioLegend, Cat. No. 101319, clone 93) for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to block Fc receptors (1:50 dilution). 371 To label myeloid cells, the homogenates were incubated with a Cd11b antibody conjugated with 372 APC fluorophore for 20 min at 4\u00b0C (Tonbo bioscience, Cat: 20-0112, clone M1/70, 1:100 373 dilution). Sytox-blue live/dead stain (Thermofisher, S34857) was included 5 min before sorting 374 (1:1000 dilution). Cell suspensions were then sorted on a flow cytometer (BD FACSAria II). Live 375 Cd11b+ fraction was then sorted into pre-chilled RPMI-1640 media (Thermofisher Scientific, 376 12633012) containing 5% FBS. FACS gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig 1. The FACS 377 procedures were performed by the Gladstone Flow Core (Gladstone Institutes, ://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14049). Single-cell expression libraries were prepared 385 using the 10x genomics Chromium single cell 3\u2032 library and gel bead kit v2 reagents (10x 386 Genomics, PN-120237). To minimize batch effects, all 4 samples were prepared simultaneously 387 in a single assay. Briefly, suspension containing 2,000-10,000 single cells were loaded into the 388 10x single cell A chip and processed in the 10x Chromium controller. After reverse transcription, 389 cDNAs were amplified by 12-14 PCR cycles. An aliquot of 35 ul cDNA product was then used 390 for library construction, which included 14 cycles of sample index PCR to barcode samples. The 391 quality of the cDNA library was checked by the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). KAPA qPCR was 392 performed to measure the library quantities. A pool of all quantity-balanced libraries was then 393 sequenced on the NextSeq 500 sequencer (Illumina) at an average sequencing depth of 45,002 394 reads/cell (post normalization). The single-cell library preparation and sequencing steps were 395 performed by the Gladstone Genomics Core (Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, USA). 396 397 Bioinformatics 398The Illumina BCL output files were processed by the Cell Ranger software (2.0.1, 10x Genomics). 399Sequencing reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10). A total of 2,149 cells were captured. 400On average, 1,607 genes/cell and 4,632 UMIs/cell were detected. Over 94.6% reads were detected 401 in cells. Downstream gene profile analyses were performed using the Seurat package in R [Seurat 402 2.0,(Butler et al., 2018)].
