Nearly half the victims were Australians. Bali has always been a party destination for young Australians. However, it is important to recognize that Indonesians and people from 20 other countries were also killed. This shows the cosmopolitan nature of the market in many modern destinations. Interestingly, while Indonesia is 85 per cent Muslim, Bali is largely Hindu in religious persuasion.

Transatlantic and domestic air travel fell by between 30 and 50 per cent. As a result the US government actually gave emergency financial aid to airlines in the USA. This was very controversial as many commentators believed that the airlines were in trouble before 11 September and cynically exploited the events of 11 September to gain government help. For example, a BBC study in January 2001, told of the woes facing American Airlines and US Airways under the heading, 'US airline profits fell to earth'. The downturn in the US airline market was due to the economic recession in the USA, even before 11 September. Of course, these events worsened an already bad situation. The aid for American airlines was also resented by airlines in other parts of the world where they were adversely affected by the attacks, but did not receive any aid.",
