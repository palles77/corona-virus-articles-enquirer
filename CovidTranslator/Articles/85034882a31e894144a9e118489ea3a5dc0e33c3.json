On the face of it, these guidelines are simple and straightforward. But, as the experience of SARS and the recent H1N1 outbreak has shown, outbreak control and outbreak communication is rarely a pure, clean process of winning public trust and transmitting information objectively and openly.

Based on psychometric studies of risk perception, Paul Slovic et al. evolved a basic model of risk perception, listing several factors that caused people to perceive events as high risk, even when experts judged them to be low risk. Hazards that were new, uncontrollable and catastrophic in consequences were perceived as high risk, even when experts judged a low statistical probability of these risks occurring. In contrast, hazards or dangers that were familiar and controllable were perceived as low risk, even though statistically they had a high probability. In contrast to lay perceptions, expert perceptions of risk were based on expected annual mortality from a hazard or danger. 4 Risk communication consultants such as Vincent Covello et al. and Peter Sandman used the findings of Slovic and others to develop strategies that helped experts and managers to communicate to the public in a way so that their perceptions of risk more closely approximated those of experts. 5, 6 Communication tool kits were devised to help communicators to either calm public anxieties, if experts felt that these anxieties were inappropriate, or to increase risk perceptions if experts Special theme -Public health communication Risk and outbreak communication Thomas Abraham felt that the public was insufficiently concerned about grave risks. Thus Peter Sandman's tool kits for precaution advocacy and outrage management are designed to help communicators to raise or lower public risk perceptions to match the level of the experts. Precaution advocacy is used to alert people who are insufficiently concerned by hazards that experts feel to be serious, and outrage management is used to calm down people who are judged to be over-concerned about minor risks. In the event of a social crisis, crisis communication is designed to help people resist their emotions and act wisely in difficult situations. 7",

An enquiry into the social and political foundations on which risk is distributed in society may seem far removed from these aims but the way audiences respond to messages is dependent on their perceptions of risk distribution. From a public health perspective, a farmer with an outbreak of avian influenza on his farm needs to take on board a straightforward message to cull his chickens and ducks to curtail the outbreak. From the farmer's point of view however, he is being asked to bear the cost of destroying his livelihood to reduce the risk to other members of society. He could well see himself as bearing a disproportionate level of risk and his compliance with health messages would depend on the extent to which these messages also address larger issues such as compensation for bearing this risk to his livelihood.",

He says that disease epidemics are accompanied by three kinds of psychosocial epidemics: epidemics of fear, of explanation and of action. 9 These three phases can occur simultaneously: \"Any society gripped by a florid form of epidemic psychology may, therefore simultaneously experience waves of individual and collective panic, outbursts of interpretation as to why the disease occurred, rashes of moral controversy, and plagues of competing control strategies, aimed at either containing the disease itself, or else at controlling the further epidemics of fear and social dissolution.\" 9",

This is a period of great intellectual confusion when \"a hundred different theories may be produced about the origins of the disease and its potential effects\". 9 Many of these questions are moral in nature: how could God -or the government -have allowed it?

            "text": "Understanding differences in cultural practices and beliefs are of vital importance in evolving successful risk and outbreak communication practices. One of the weaknesses of the psychometric paradigm is that its evidence base is largely North American. The subjects for the experiments on which the paradigm was based were small, culturally specific groups of North Americans -e.g. members of the League of Women Voters in Oregon, college students or residents of towns in New Jersey. A question often asked, but rarely answered, is whether the psychobehavioural responses of these groups correspond to groups in completely different cultural environments. For example, would members of the League of Women Voters perceive and respond similarly to risk as poultry farmers in Viet Nam? Would the same techniques of communication be relevant for these widely differing groups? Different cultures ascribe different meanings to illness, sickness and disease and biomedical explanations of disease are not universally accepted. 11 A study of the understandings of acute respiratory illness among mothers and community health volunteers in Bangladesh, for example, found that, similar to other Asian countries, influenza and influenza-like illnesses were attributed to imbalances between \"hot and cold\" in the body. 12 Eating foods thought to be \"cold\" such as rice, bananas and beans were thought to aggravate or, in some cases, cause influenza. Remedies consisted of massaging the patient with \"warming\" substances such as a mixture of garlic and oil and cumin seeds. The way people respond to health communication messages is dependent on whether their cultural construction of the disease is similar to that of the communicator. Of particular interest to outbreak communication is the possibility that, in the case of new, previously unknown illnesses, people may well turn to culturally determined explanations of illness to help them understand and cope with the disease. 13",

            "text": "Second, the work of Ulrich Beck and Mary Douglas help to sensitize health communicators to the underlying political and social questions about blame and unfair distribution of risk that are on the public mind during outbreaks. These include questions such as whether the government is to blame for the outbreak and, if not, who is to blame, whether drugs and vaccines have been fairly distributed and whether quarantine and other measures such as travel restrictions have been fairly applied. Health communicators need to be able to handle these political issues skilfully and they need the training and tools to do so. Otherwise, their health messages run the risk of being ignored in a storm of political outrage.",

However, compliance with disease control measures is necessary to prevent outbreaks from spreading. This is especially important since, in cases of unknown disease outbreaks or previously unforeseen catastrophes, people may turn to traditional explanations of disease. Communicators specializing in behaviour change communication and social mobilization have a variety of tools to deal with these issues and so they are often called on during outbreaks. It would be beneficial if these tools were incorporated into general outbreak communication principles. \u25a0 Funding: This paper was funded by WHO. A longer version of this paper was presented to a WHO working group meeting on outbreak communication in Geneva, September 2007.",

En este estudio se analizan otros enfoques sociol\u00f3gicos y culturales de expertos como Ulrich Beck y Mary Douglas para identificar algunas claves respecto a la manera de comunicar la informaci\u00f3n en esos entornos. Se recomienda crear nuevos instrumentos para la comunicaci\u00f3n sobre los brotes a fin de abordar cuestiones como la culpaci\u00f3n y la justicia en lo que ata\u00f1e a la distribuci\u00f3n de los riesgos o la resistencia de parte de la poblaci\u00f3n a aceptar las explicaciones biom\u00e9dicas de la enfermedad.
