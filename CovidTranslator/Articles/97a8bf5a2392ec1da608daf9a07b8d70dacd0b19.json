            "text": "The influenza virus enters its target cells by receptormediated endocytosis, which is followed by acid-induced fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes. This fusion event is mediated by a conformational change of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein, triggered by the low pH in the endosomal lumen. 11 The endosomal acidic pH also activates the membrane-spanning A/M2 protein, which acts as a proton channel to conduct protons into the virion interior. The decrease in intravirion pH results in uncoating of the viral ribonucleoprotein, which is transferred, through the fusion pore, to the cytoplasm. 12 Since this endosomal escape of the virus critically depends on the activity of the M2 proton channel and the HA protein, dually acting agents which combine blockade of the M2 channel with an inhibitory effect on HA refolding, appear highly attractive. This dual approach could also, at least in theory, increase the barrier for selecting Amt resistance. 13 Optimized Amt analogues might be able to exert this dual pharmacological effect, provided that both the M2 and HA inhibition occur at similar and clinically relevant compound concentrations. For comparison, the M2 blocking effect of Amt is achieved at micromolar concentrations, whereas its effect on HA refolding requires much higher concentrations (i.e., in the range of 100 \u03bcM). These high Amt concentrations cannot be achieved in vivo with the standard Amt drug regimens, since the reported plasma concentration values for Amt are in the range of 2 \u03bcM. 14 Hence, to potentially exploit the effect of Amt analogues on HA refolding, novel derivatives with a more potent activity (i.e., IC 50 values in the micromolar range) would be required.",

            "text": "It is well-known in medicinal chemistry that for drugs containing cyclic systems, it is generally worth synthesizing analogues where the ring is opened, expanded or contracted by one unit. These analogues show similar activity to the parent compound and sometimes display improved pharmacokinetic profile. Also, it is of interest to simplify a polycyclic active compound by removing some of the rings. 15 Previously we synthesized and evaluated a series of ring-contracted, ringexpanded, and ring-rearranged analogues of Amt and rimantadine. Although we found several compounds with very interesting activities as M2 channel blockers or modifiers of the HA refolding, no dual agents were found. 16\u221220 Recently, we have reported that diene 1 displayed similar IC50 values for wild-type (wt) A/M2 to Amt, although it was inactive against the Amt-resistant S31N form of A/M2. 17 As expected, amine 1 was active in a cytopathic effect (CPE) assay (EC 50 = 14 \u03bcM) against the Amt-sensitive A/HK/7/87 strain, an H3N2 virus with a wt-type A/M2 channel. Interestingly, amine 1 was also active (EC 50 = 16 \u03bcM) against the A/PR/8/ 34 strain, an H1N1 virus carrying two characteristic Amt resistance mutations in its M2 protein (S31N and V27T). A detailed study of the mechanism of action of this and several related analogues suggested that their target was the H1 type HA, through an effect on its refolding. 19 Thus, this compound may be considered a lead for dually acting compounds. Of note, we have also reported that a simplified analogue of diene 1, 3azatetracyclo[5.2.1.1 5, 8 .0 1,5 ]undecane, 2, displayed a better inhibition of the wt A/M2 channel (IC 50 = 11.7 \u03bcM) than 1 (IC 50 = 33.5 \u03bcM) and was slightly more potent in the CPE assay (EC 50 = 14.0 \u03bcM for 1; EC 50 = 7.9 \u03bcM for 2) against the Amt-sensitive A/HK/7/87 strain. In sharp contrast with diene 1, which was also active against the A/PR/8/34 strain, azaundecane 2 was inactive against this Amt-resistant strain (Scheme 1). 20 In the present work, we report on the synthesis and antiviral activity of further ring-simplified analogues of 1. We found that several of these novel polycyclic amines, that have considerable higher conformational freedom than 1 and 2, display low micromolar activity against the Amt-resistant A/PR/8/34 strain (A/H1N1). However, this activity was markedly subtype-",

First, within the series of [4, 4, 3] azapropellanes, progressive saturation of the diene 4 to alkene 7 and to the fully saturated 5 increased the antiviral activity against the A/PR/8/34 strain (EC 50 = 38, 30, and 5.9 \u03bcM for 4, 7 and 5, respectively). This trend had been previously seen on going from diene 1 (EC 50 = 16 \u03bcM) to its fully saturated derivative (EC 50 = 2.0 \u03bcM). 25 Interestingly, going from diene 4 to its tetramethyl derivative 11 also increased the activity (EC 50 = 38 \u03bcM for 4 vs EC 50 = 7 \u03bcM for 11). Unfortunately, several attempts to carry out the reduction of 11 either with catalytic hydrogenation or diimide were unsuccessful, likely due to steric hindrance. Second, ring contraction from the [4, 4, 3] azapropellane to the [4,3,3]azapropellane did not improve the activity (compare 7 vs 13), while the introduction of a methylidene group in the fivemembered ring slightly increased the activity (compare 13 vs 18). Third, the smallest member of this series, [3, 3, 3] azapropellane 21 was inactive as was its monomethylidene derivative 31. However, introduction of a second methylidene group, as in 24, led to an active compound (EC 50 < 0.8 \u03bcM), nearly 2 orders of magnitude more potent than Amt and rimantadine. Finally, with the only exception of compound 26, that was more potent than amine 27, the introduction of a guanidine group was clearly deleterious for the activity, leading largely to inactive compounds.",

Alkylation of 15 using lithium hexamethyldisilazane (LiHMDS) and 3-chloro-2-(chloromethyl)-1-propene furnished imide 16 in 70% yield. Removal of the protecting group was accomplished with cerium ammonium nitrate (CAN) in 70% yield. Reduction of the imide gave propellane 18 in 74% yield (Scheme 2).Finally, seven compounds containing the [3,3,3]azapropellane scaffold were synthesized (Scheme 3). Reduction of the known imide 19 with sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride furnished 20 in 75% yield. The hydrogenolysis of the benzyl protecting group furnished the[3,3,3]azapropellane 21 in 90% yield. Finally, reaction of 21 with 1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine led to the guanidine 22 in very low yield. Similarly, reduction of imide 23, previously synthesized by our group, gave diene 24 in 80% yield. The guanidine 25 was synthesized following the general procedure in 75% yield. The catalytic hydrogenation of 24 and 25 gave the fully saturated compounds 27 and 26, respectively, as mixtures of stereoisomers, in very high yields.",
