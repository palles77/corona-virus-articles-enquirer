            "text": "The nasal epithelium from a young girl was examined by electron microscopy and found to be infected by coronavirus. Virions are seen within and outside the ciliated cells, but not outside or within the goblet cells or other cells of the nasal mucosa. Some virions are located near the microvilli, others in pockets in the apical cell membrane. The cytoplasm contains many small vesicles with a single virion, large apical vesicles containing hundreds of virions, and lysosome-like cytosomes with a moderate number of virions. Some viruslike particles devoid of an electron-dense interior are seen both in the cytosomes and extracellularly. Virus budding was observed in the Golgi apparatus but nowhere else in the cell. The ciliated cells seem not to be destroyed by the viruses, although in many cases the cilia are withdrawn into the cell body. The loss of cilia is likely to cause rhinorrhoea.",

The same is true of ciliated epithelia infected with viruses of other kinds. Although human nasal and bronchial epithelium have been studied electron microscopically during episodes of common cold (Carson et al. 1985; Giorgi et al. 1992; Rautiainen et al. 1992; Winther et al. 1984) , or other viral infections (Cornille et al. 1984; Konradova et al. 1982) , the viruses within the epithelial cells causing the infections seem to have eluded the investigators. Certain changes in the infected ciliated nasal epithelium have been reported, such as a detachment of ciliated cells from the epithelium (Ramphal et al. 1979; Turner et al. 1982; Winther et al. 1984) , or a loss of cilia from the ciliated cells (Rautiainen et al. 1992 ), but the mechanisms by which the viruses cause these effects remain unknown.",

Coronaviruses contact the microvilli of the ciliated cell and enter it in apical membrane invaginations. From there they are taken up in small vesicles and transported to the Golgi apparatus, where virus multiplication takes place. They are then transported back to the apical cytoplasm and are stored there in the large apical vesicles before release into the nasal lumen. The formation of the apical vesicles causes the basal bodies to be displaced from the cell surface and to retract into the cell. As a consequence thereof the cells become deciliated and the patient will experience rhinorrhoea. Alternatively, the invading virions are degraded and uncoated in the large apical vesicles before being transported to the Golgi apparatus.",
