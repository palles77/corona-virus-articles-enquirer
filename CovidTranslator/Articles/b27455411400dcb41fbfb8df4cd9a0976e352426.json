A coronavirus was reported to be involved in the etiology of the disease, mostly on the basis of the isolation of a virus in cultures of kidney cells from a patient with EBN (1, 3) . In addition, EBN-associated virus is reported to share serologic homology with human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E, as well as the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (formal name: Transmissible gastroenteritis virus [TGEV]), a virus that our laboratory has been studying for 16 years (4, 5) . The objective of this commentary is to clarify whether the EBN-associated virus is in fact related to members of the Coronaviridae family (6) .",

In contrast, electron microscopy preparations of TGEV observed in parallel showed virions approximately 120 nm in diameter, with a corona of typical projecting peplomers (8, 9) (Figure, C) . The morphology of TGEV clearly differed from that of the EBN-associated virus that had no peplomers.

Accordingly, we think that the involvement of a coronavirus should no longer be considered in EBN induction. Further studies are needed to clarify the nature of the 28.4-nm, non-enveloped virus particles found in the kidney cells of patients with EBN and to determine whether this virus is the causal agent of the disease.",
