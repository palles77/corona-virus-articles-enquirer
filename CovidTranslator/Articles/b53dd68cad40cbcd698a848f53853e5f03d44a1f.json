To our knowledge, this study was the first 197 to explore the reliability and validity of wrist and forehead temperature measurement in mass 198 screening. 199 Previous studies showed that axilla, rectal temperature were the gold standards in clinical 200 practice (14, 15). However, it was impractical for the large-scale screening. Timesaving and 201 less invasive tools were needed. IRTT and NCIT are being applied in the general population 202 during the epidemic. A lot of disposable plastic covers were consumed, which may increase 203 the financial burden. In China, it cost 1-2 RMB (about 0.2 dollars) for per disposable plastic 204 cover. Besides, indirect contacts increased the risk of cross infection. Forehead temperature 205 was used for the widespread use of population screening using NCIT. However, it can be 206 affected by a person's physiological and environmental conditions (8, 16). The forehead 207 temperature value of 23 participants showed \"low\" in our study. This all happened on the 208 same day (February 17th, 2020) with an outside temperature of 7\u00b0C. Thus, we chose wrist 209 temperature as an alternative, especially in the winter when mass screening is needed. Wrist 210 measurement indicated peripheral temperature at 10 cm above the palmar side of the wrist. It 211 was within our expectation that wrist measurement readings attained was lower than 212 tympanic route. However, this area was covered by clothing all the time. It was less 213 influenced by environmental conditions. Our study showed it was more stable for participants 214 under different circumstance than forehead measurement.

There were several limitations. First, it is difficult to quantify the 221 physiological and environmental conditions. Second, only one brand of thermometer was 222 enrolled in this study. It was uncertain that it could be generalized to all brands of 223 thermometers in the market. 224In conclusion, this study confirmed wrist measurement was more stable for participants 225 under different circumstance than forehead measurement.
