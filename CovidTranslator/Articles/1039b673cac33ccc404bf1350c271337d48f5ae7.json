Obviously, this requires differentiation from hypoproteinemic states, vasculitis, thrombophlebitis, lymphadenitis, or other less common diseases. Dyspnea, tachypnea, and grossly distended jugular or mammary veins are possible signs of cardiac disease that may be observed during general inspection of the patient. Weakness and exercise intolerance are other signs that require consideration of cardiac disease. In calves, overt congenital abnormalities such as microphthalmos, wry tail, or absence of a tail may also signal the possibility of an accompanying ventricular septal defect (VSD), and ectopia cordis is grossly apparent by inspection of the thoracic inlet or caudal cervical area. However, the majority of congenital heart malformations occur in the absence of other defects. In calves, failure to thrive in comparison with age-matched herdmates, exercise intolerance, and resting tachypnea or dyspnea may suggest a congenital cardiac condition, but confirmation and characterization require auscultation and echocardiography.",

The visual appearance of the oral mucous membranes can vary with normal pigmentation patterns specific to the breed (e.g., Brown Swiss and Channel Islands cattle) and often appear pale to the inexperienced examiner in variably pigmented breeds such as Holsteins. In general, inspection of conjunctival and vulval mucous membrane appearance and refill time is preferable. Cyanosis is rare in dairy cattle with the exception of animals that are dying of severe pulmonary disease. However, cattle having advanced heart failure, rightto-left congenital shunts, and combined cardiopulmonary disease may have cyanotic mucous membranes. Capillary refill time often is prolonged in cattle with advanced cardiac disease.",

Proficiency and practice at palpation of major veins are essential before an examiner can differentiate an abnormal finding from the normal range of variation found in cattle of various ages and stages of lactation. Normally, mammary veins are more sensitive indicators of increased venous pressure than jugular veins and therefore should be palpated routinely during the physical examination. Jugular veins should be observed during the general inspection and again during thoracic auscultation. Jugular veins should not be palpated until the end of the physical examination because many cattle become apprehensive when the neck region is palpated; this apprehension and subsequent excitement could affect baseline parameters or data being collected during the physical examination. This evaluation of the jugular veins, if deemed necessary, should be done at the end of the physical examination during examination of the head.",

First the vein is palpated gently to detect pulsations suggestive of right heart failure; then the vein is compressed against the abdominal wall by gentle fingertip pressure. The amount of pressure necessary to compress the vein against the abdominal wall normally is minimal. When the vein is difficult to compress or, more commonly, seems to roll away from the fingertips, increased venous pressure from right heart failure may be suspected. These evaluations of the mammary veins obviously are subjective techniques but can be helpful adjuncts to other findings when practiced during every physical examination. Although pulsations in the mammary veins are considered abnormal findings suggestive of right heart failure, an occasional healthy older cow with a large udder and rich mammary vein branching may have slight mammary vein pulsation and distention.",

            "text": "Evaluation of the jugular veins for pulsation and distention requires differentiation of the notorious \"false\"-jugular pulsation commonly observed in thin-necked dairy cattle from true pathologic jugular pulsation and distention. False or normal jugular pulsation is a product of reverse blood flow from atrial contraction at the end of diastole and expansion of the right atrioventricular (AV) valve during systole. Passive jugular filling during systole also may contribute, as does a \"kick,\" or referred carotid artery pulsation. False jugular pulsation arises as a wave that winds its way from the thoracic inlet to the mandible when the cow has her head and neck parallel to the ground. When the head and neck are raised, the false jugular pulse may only ascend a portion of the cervical area or may disappear. A true jugular pulse fills the whole jugular vein rapidly when the head and neck are parallel to the ground or slightly raised. This rapid filling is similar to filling a garden hose with the end held off when water to the hose is turned on full force. In addition, distention of the jugular veins is more obvious with true jugular distention as found in right heart failure ( Fig.  3 .1). When confusion exists, the jugular vein may be held off near the ramus of the mandible, blood forced distally toward the thoracic inlet by the examiner's hand, and the vein observed (Video Clip 3.1). Emptying the vein in this fashion will eliminate a false jugular pulse, but a true jugular pulse will refill the emptied vein quickly and indicates right heart failure, increased central venous pressure, or right AV valve insufficiency. Some examiners suggest applying light pressure that partially occludes the jugular vein at the thoracic inlet, thereby mildly distending the jugular vein. This is thought to eliminate false (or normal) jugular venous pulsations from a referred carotid arterial impact. In general, the degree of gross distention of the jugular veins in cattle having right heart failure is more impressive than the degree of pulsation (Video Clip 3.2).",

The middle coccygeal artery is the first artery palpated for pulsation during the physical examination. The facial artery is used when treating recumbent (hypocalcemic) cattle, and the median artery is the most convenient to palpate when performing simultaneous cardiac auscultation and pulse monitoring. Pulse rate, rhythm, and quality should be assessed. Pulse quality implies considerations of the size, strength, and duration of the pulse wave and distention of the artery. Most cattle with heart failure have decreased pulse strength, unevenness of the pulse, increased pulse rate, or a pulse rate that is different than the heart rate. Abnormalities in pulse rate or rhythm should alert the examiner to the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias.",

Many cattle object to stethoscope placement over the sites on the chest wall necessary for cardiac auscultation and adduct the forelimb tightly against the thorax. This is noticed especially on examining the right side, where cardiac auscultation in cattle requires the stethoscope to be placed very cranial in the axillary area around the third intercostal space (ICS). Dairy bulls and large or fat cows have thick chest walls that reduce the intensity of heart sounds. Heart sounds are easier to hear on the left side of normal cattle. The pulmonic valve region is best heard in the left third ICS at a level between the shoulder and elbow. The aortic valve region near the heart base is best heard in the left fourth ICS at approximately shoulder level. The mitral (left AV) valve region coincides with the cardiac apex and is best heard at the left fifth ICS just above the elbow. The right AV (tricuspid) valve is heard far forward in the right third ICS at a level halfway between elbow and shoulder.",

Although the potential for four heart sounds is somewhat confusing and may be impossible to differentiate in most clinical patients, examiners should be aware of these facts and not overinterpret the significance of auscultating more than two heart sounds. The first heart sound (S1) heralds the beginning of systole, is associated with the final halting of AV valve motion after closing, and is best heard at the apex regions coinciding with AV valves in the cow. A slight splitting of S1 into separate mitral and tricuspid valve components is possible but is rarely audible in normal cattle. S1 tends to be of lower frequency and longer duration than S2.",

Ventricular vibrations at the end of rapid filling in early diastole are thought to cause S3, a low-frequency sound seldom heard in cattle. S4 sometimes is heard late in diastole and is related to atrial contraction. In cattle with tachycardia, it has been suggested that S4 may in fact closely precede S1 and be mistaken for a split S1. The tripling or quadrupling of heart sounds that resembles a horse's cantering gait is commonly referred to as a gallop rhythm and occurs in the higher range of normal heart rates or when tachycardia exists in some cows. Gallops are diastolic sounds related to atrial contraction (S4 gallop), to ventricular filling (S3), or to both (summation gallop). A prominent and persistent gallop rhythm in a cow with tachycardia may be the first indication of heart disease.",

            "text": "The heart rate of normal adult cattle is 60 to 84 beats/ min. Neonatal calves may have normal heart rates as high as 110 to 120 beats/min, but frequently heart rates this high are brought about by the excitement of being handled or in anticipation of being fed. Not everyone agrees on the aforementioned range of normal heart rates for cattle, and several points should be addressed regarding this topic. Oxen and fat, persistently dry cows used only for embryo transfer may have a slower metabolism than lactating dairy cattle. Therefore, somewhat similar to draft horses, these cattle may have heart rates at the low end of the normal range or even less than 60 beats/min. Conversely, healthy but excited, nervous, or aggressive cattle may have heart and pulse rates more than 84 beats/min when approached by any examiner. Therefore, the range of 60 to 84 beats/min really is an average and must be interpreted in light of the patient, its surroundings, and its intended use. Following the work of McGuirk et al. with fasted cattle, a low normal range of 48 beats/min has been proposed. Further studies demonstrated that in normal cattle, a decrease in ruminoreticular fill results in a reflex slowing of the heart rate, predominantly because of an increase in parasympathetic tone. However, fasted healthy cattle seldom are encountered in the world outside of academic settings, and veterinarians are not frequently asked to examine healthy fasted cattle. An exception may be a cow off feed secondary to the classic broken water cup syndrome because she will become anorectic secondary to water deprivation. Sick cattle seldom have a heart rate less than 60 beats/min only because they are anorectic. Sick cattle that do have heart rates less than 60 beats/min usually have a vagal nerve-mediated bradycardia. Therefore, 60 to 84 beats/min is still our preferred normal range for heart rate in adult dairy cattle.",

Muffling also results from pathologic conditions such as pericarditis, pneumomediastinum, diaphragmatic hernia, and displacement of the heart toward the opposite hemithorax by an abscess or tumor in the hemithorax being auscultated.

Intensity may be ranked subjectively on a 1 to 6 basis, with 1 of 6 being a faint, barely detectable murmur; 2 of 6 a soft but easily discernible murmur; 3 of 6 a low to moderate intensity murmur; 4 of 6 moderate in intensity but lacking a thrill; 5 of 6 a loud murmur with a palpable thrill; and 6 of 6 so loud that it can be heard with the stethoscope off the chest and evincing a palpable thrill. Classification relative to timing of the cardiac cycle further defines murmurs as systolic, diastolic, or continuous. Further division is provided by terms such as \"early systolic\" or \"holosystolic.\" In general, whereas systolic murmurs in cattle reflect AV valve insufficiency or, much less commonly, aortic or pulmonic stenosis, diastolic murmurs reflect aortic or pulmonic valve insufficiency or rarely AV valve abnormalities. Benign systolic murmurs occasionally are heard in excited, tachycardic calves, or cows with anemia, hypoproteinemia, or in those being given rapid intravenous (IV) infusions of fluids. Pathologic systolic murmurs most commonly are found in calves with congenital heart abnormalities such as VSD or tetralogy of Fallot and in adult cows with endocarditis. Continuous murmurs are rare but may be encountered in calves having a patent ductus arteriosus or in cows with pericarditis.

Extreme hyperkalemia (>7.0 mEq/L) may lead to cardiac arrest and should be corrected immediately, especially in calves that may require general anesthesia.

Cardiac ultrasonography, however, has largely superseded the ECG as a diagnostic tool in determining chamber enlargement and other cardiac pathology.",

The diagnosis of heart disease may be clinically difficult until overt signs of heart failure occur (e.g., peripheral edema, distended jugular veins, or true jugular pulse). However, some cardiac diseases such as endocarditis and VSD may be less commonly associated with clinical signs of heart failure. Routine cardiac auscultation also has its limitations, especially under noisy field conditions or in adults with high body condition score. For these reasons, ancillary tests may be extremely valuable in reaching the definitive diagnosis and to facilitate appropriate case management. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is becoming more available and more readily accessible on farms because of improvements in ultrasound quality, affordability, and portability. This imaging technique has the potential to help practitioners reach a definitive diagnosis antemortem, therefore improving case management. Importantly, it can help avoid unnecessary treatments if the prognosis is hopeless as well as differentiate life-threatening conditions (pericarditis secondary to hardware disease) from more benign ones (idiopathic hemorrhagic pericarditis). By contrast with other veterinary species (small animals, horses) in which echocardiographic examination now entails precise calculations of various functional indices or dimensions and can require extensive postgraduate training and expensive equipment and software, bovine echocardiography does not. A great deal of information can be obtained when one knows which views are needed and how to get them. Several of the common cardiac conditions of dairy calves and adult cattle have characteristic ultrasonographic features, and when a veterinarian has become somewhat familiar with the likely image findings for each, a definitive diagnosis can often be reached. Practically speaking, a complete echocardiographic examination can be performed on the farm in about 15 to 20 minutes.",

An assistant may also be useful depending on the patient's demeanor to keep the thoracic limb forward during the examination to improve access to the cardiac window on the side in question. The author (SB) generally prefers to put his own leg medial to the forelimb in order to perform a gentle abduction of the cow's limb; this often helps in obtaining better quality images ( Fig. 3.6 ). TTE is classically performed using \"cardiac windows\" composed of the ventral third to fifth ICSs on both the right and left sides of the thorax. Ideally, the area is clipped, and ultrasonographic coupling gel is applied. Depending on the context of the examination, a faster technique may be achieved by applying 70% isopropyl alcohol directly to the unclipped skin surface without coupling gel. The author has used this technique increasingly to good effect in recent years. It has the advantage of avoiding unnecessary clipping if there is a high likelihood of sale or culling in the near future and is also more popular with owners of individually valuable cattle during show season! Hair length and body condition (chest wall thickness) can both interfere with the diagnostic quality of images when only alcohol is used. A low-frequency probe (\u22643.5 MHz) with good penetration (examination depth >20 cm) is required for adult cows. For calves, a 5 MHz probe is usually adequate because of the smaller size of the thorax. The major limiting factor in performing TTE is the size and shape of the probe compared with the width and accessibility of the relevant intercostal spaces. Many cattle, even those without painful chest walls, resent examination under the elbow and into the axillae, tending to respond by powerful, counterproductive forelimb adduction as the examiner moves the probe forward. Probe rotation, necessary to obtain the standard views, is often challenging, especially in the more cranial ICSs. The phased-array probes (specifically used for echocardiography and therefore more expensive) are optimal; larger sector probes also work quite well but may have limitations for some of the views described in the following section.",

The obvious difference in prevalence of acute myocardial ischemia between cattle and humans means that the number one indication for cTnI measurement in human patients will never be duplicated in cattle. However, bovine cTnI has been examined in association with congenital heart defects in calves, experimental monensin toxicosis, and a variety of primary cardiac conditions such as endocarditis and pericarditis, as well as in dairy cattle with common, noncardiac production diseases.

Other studies have suggested an upper cutoff point of 0.08 ng/mL when a different, laboratory-based immunoassay was used. Cattle with severe, acute myocardial injury, such as that caused by ionophore toxicosis, show marked increases in cTnI to greater than 1 ng/mL over a 1-to 6-day interval after a single, massive overdose. This quantitative increase is paralleled by echocardiographic, electrocardiographic, and histopathologic evidence of marked myocardial necrosis and cardiac dysfunction. Other studies looking at congenital cardiac defects and acquired cardiac conditions of adulthood (pericarditis and endocarditis) have also demonstrated elevations above normal controls, but there is no useful prognostic information in cattle at this point that can be extrapolated from these data.

Muffling and splashing sounds are possible if a pericardial transudate or exudate is present. The most common site of tumor involvement is the right atrium, but nodular or infiltrative tumors can be found anywhere in the myocardium, pericardium, or epicardium (Figs. 3.19 to 3.21). The color and consistency of the tumors may vary. Mediastinal lymph nodes also are commonly involved. Cattle with signs of heart disease should be thoroughly examined for other lesions consistent with lymphosarcoma. When multiple lesions exist, the diagnosis is easy. However, cattle examined because of vague signs such as hypophagia and decreased milk production that are found to have tachycardia or other cardiac abnormalities can present diagnostic challenges. Although ECGs and thoracic radiographs have seldom helped make a definitive diagnosis, echocardiography may be very helpful to image nodular or large masses of lymphosarcoma. Common echocardiographic findings include varying degrees of pericardial effusion that usually cannot be accurately distinguished from other causes of pericardial effusion by appearance alone (e.g., needs to be confirmed by pericardiocentesis) or the presence of a mass effect in the right atrial wall or atrial wall thickening (Fig. 3.22 ). In the case of a mass in the right atrial wall, the other important differential diagnosis would be mural endocarditis, although this is very uncommon. Thoracocentesis and pericardiocentesis to obtain fluid for cytologic evaluation are the most helpful ancillary aids when cardiac lymphosarcoma is suspected (Fig. 3 .23). A complete blood count (CBC) and assessment of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) antibody status are indicated, but a positive BLV agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test does not ensure an absolute diagnosis because most positive cattle never develop tumors (see the section on lymphosarcoma in Chapter 16). Therefore, simply assuming a cow with a positive BLV test and heart abnormality detected on physical examination has lymphosarcoma may be an incorrect assumption. A double line-positive BLV-AGID may add further weight to the suspected diagnosis, as would the finding of a persistent lymphocytosis (PL) in a CBC. Clinical identification of masses in other locations or cytology from thoracocentesis or pericardiocentesis provides the best means of definitive diagnosis. If both pleural and pericardial effusions can be identified, then pericardiocentesis will often provide a greater chance of identifying exfoliated neoplastic cells in cases of cardiac lymphosarcoma because pleural fluid accumulation may just reflect a transudate associated with poor cardiac function. Fever usually is absent in cattle with cardiac lymphosarcoma. Occasionally, cattle with large tumor masses in the thorax or abdomen may have fever because of tumor necrosis or nonspecific pyrogens produced by the neoplasms. Secondary bacterial infections of the lungs or other body systems also may lead to fever, which confuses the diagnosis.",

Septicemic calves, calves suspected of having H. somni infection, and calves with chronic infections should be suspected of having septic myocarditis if an arrhythmia or other signs of abnormal cardiac function develop during their illness. White muscle disease, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia should also be considered in the differential. Septicemic calves have a guarded prognosis, and septic myocarditis worsens it. Foci of septic myocarditis in adult cattle with chronic, active infection or abscesses associated with mastitis, localized peritonitis, foot lesions, or chronic pneumonia are more commonly identified by pathologists than clinicians. Although tachycardia is likely to be present, this finding often is assumed to result from the primary illness rather than from myocarditis. As with calves, adult cattle with septic myocarditis may have paroxysmal cardiac arrhythmias that alert the clinician to the diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis has been difficult in the living patient, but increased concentrations of troponin I may be used to help diagnose myocardial disease. An ECG showing atrial or ventricular premature depolarizations in a calf or cow with evidence of sepsis or a walled-off infection can be used to lend credence to the diagnosis. Although bovine echocardiography does not have the same diagnostic utility for myocardial disease as it does for endocardial and pericardial conditions, it can still be of some value, particularly in cases of cardiomyopathy or myocardial mass lesions such as lymphosarcoma and myocardial abscesses. In all cases of myocardial injury, whether it is toxic (ionophore, gossypol, other toxic plants), nutritional (white muscle disease) or inflammatory (H. somni), disease progression will ultimately be accompanied by cardiac dilation and resultant nonspecific echocardiographic changes if the animal survives the acute injury. Presumably, the right ventricular hypertrophy that accompanies high-altitude pulmonary hypertension in brisket disease of cattle maintained at elevation in the western United States might also be associated with identifiable echocardiographic abnormalities. Treatment of the primary disease remains the most important part of managing septic myocarditis. If the primary problem and myocardial lesion can be sterilized, the heart may return to normal function. Myocardial fibrosis and scarring may, however, leave the animal with a permanent arrhythmia and increase the likelihood of cardiomyopathy and eventual congestive heart failure.",

Septicemic spread of infectious organisms, thrombi, or mediators of inflammation may be involved in the pathophysiology of myocardial injury that occurs in septic cattle. Although relatively uncommon, development of persistent tachycardia with or without an arrhythmia in a patient with infectious disease may suggest myocarditis. Tachycardia is so nonspecific that most veterinarians attribute the tachycardia to the primary disease rather than secondary myocarditis. Only when the myocardial damage causes signs of heart failure does a diagnosis of myocarditis become easier. Acute death is possible. Arrhythmia, if present, must be assessed using ECG alongside blood electrolytes and acid-base status to rule out atrial fibrillation associated with metabolic abnormalities. Adult dairy cattle are most at risk for myocarditis with acute septic diseases such as severe mastitis, metritis, pneumonia, and infection caused by H. somni. Occasional cases also occur secondary to chronic localized infections such as digital abscesses that predispose to bacteremia. Depending on the size and location of the myocardial lesion, clinical signs range from subclinical to overt heart failure. ECG evidence of ventricular arrhythmias would suggest myocardial damage, but supraventricular arrhythmias are possible as well. Unfortunately, definitive antemortem diagnosis is impossible without advanced echocardiographic or invasive cardiac techniques. Treatment must be directed at the primary disease. Minor myocardial lesions away from nodal and conduction tissue may heal or fibrose asymptomatically, whereas large or multifocal lesions may lead to heart failure, persistent tachyarrhythmia, or sudden death. Although rarer than septic myocardial injury it is also possible to see myocarditis secondary to severe anemia in which an ischemic injury caused by insufficient oxygen delivery to cardiac myocytes has occurred. In this instance, it is also easy to attribute the tachycardia to the primary disease, but the observant clinician may pick up on this possibility when a tachyarrhythmia is auscultated or seen on ECG in an animal with peracute to acute hemorrhage.",

The cow should have been held off systemic antibiotics for 24 to 48 hours before culture, if possible. Although one blood culture attempt is better than none, it is preferable to obtain a series of three to four cultures when economics allow. An appropriate interval between collections of multiple samples has been debated by clinicians for decades. Some clinicians culture only during a fever spike, some at 3-to 30-minute intervals, some at 6-to 8-hour intervals, and some once daily.

Veterinarians trained in echocardiography now have a tool to confirm bacterial endocarditis in most patients. The echocardiographic examination should be performed mindful of the fact that endocarditis involves the valvular endocardium in more than 98% of reported cases; mural lesions being extremely rare. As pointed out in a systematic review of published cases by Buczinski et al. (2012) , the tricuspid valve is the most commonly affected valve (49.5%) followed by the mitral (29.7%), the pulmonary (13.7%), and aortic (7.5%) valves; information that can be particularly useful in directing the examination when performing echocardiography in cattle with an auscultable murmur. The typical endocarditic lesion will be an irregular valvular thickening with heterogeneous content and a shaggy appearance. Depending on the clinical findings and the resultant, but not invariant, murmur (auscultated in \u224860% of cases), the best views should be selected to image the suspicious valve. Most of time, it is obvious that the valve is abnormal and more than 1 cm thick (Figs. 3.28 to 3.30).",

Thus, cattle selected for treatment must be deemed valuable enough to justify the cost of antibiotics and discarded milk that will be incurred.

Because endocarditis in cattle usually is caused by T. pyogenes or Streptococcus spp., some clinicians assume penicillin will work and do not bother to do blood cultures. This assumption would be a worthwhile gamble if economics dictate that laboratory costs must be minimized. Therefore, penicillin and ampicillin have historically been the drugs of choice for bacterial endocarditis in cattle caused by T. pyogenes and most Streptococcus spp. Although ceftiofur has the advantage of limited withdrawal times, depending on formulation, it is more expensive, is not approved for this use and might be overused by some who hope the drug will cure all infections of dairy cattle. Penicillin (22,000-33,000 U/kg twice daily) or ampicillin (10-20 mg/kg twice daily) (both are extralabel dosages) is administered for a minimum of 3 weeks.

Unfortunately, there is significant variability in blood levels between treated cattle, which may limit its treatment potential. Rifampin is a unique antibiotic that gains access to intracellular organisms or walledoff infections by concentrating in macrophages. Rifampin always should be used in conjunction with another antibiotic because bacterial resistance may develop quickly when the drug is used alone. The dosage is 5 mg/kg orally, twice daily for cattle. Although some maintain this dosage is too low, it has seemed effective clinically when used in conjunction with penicillin not only for chronic T. pyogenes endocarditis but also for pulmonary abscesses. Therefore, if economics allow, oral rifampin has been reported to improve treatment success in cattle with bacterial endocarditis. Unfortunately, currently within the United States, the Food and Drug Administration requires that cattle treated with rifampin are not used for either commercial milk or meat production, severely limiting its use. Occasionally, cattle will become significantly anorectic while receiving rifampin (more so than was noted in association with the primary disease), but in many cases, this apparent intolerance to the drug is overcome if administration is discontinued for several days and then reinstituted at the same or lesser dose.",

Dyspnea is caused by a combination of lung compression by the enlarged pericardial mass, pulmonary edema, and reduced cardiac output. Auscultation of the heart reveals bilaterally decreased intensity of the heart sounds. This muffling of heart sounds usually coexists with squeaky, rubbing sounds and splashing or tinkling sounds, but these sounds are not present in all cases. A fluid-gas interface created by gas-forming bacterial organisms in the pericardium creates the most obvious splashing sounds. Lung sounds may not be heard in the ventral third of either hemithorax because of the greatly enlarged pericardial sac displacing the lungs dorsally. In addition to these signs, there are two other very important clinical facts associated with traumatic pericarditis in dairy cattle: 1. Most cows with traumatic pericarditis were observed by the owner to be ill 7 to 14 days earlier and may or may not have been diagnosed with traumatic reticuloperitonitis at that time. Frequently, the signs of illness were vague and nonspecific, and veterinary attention may or may not have been requested. Typically, these cattle improve or appear recovered from this previous illness only to become ill again and have signs of cardiac disease. Certainly not all cattle have this two-phased clinical course, and some have peracute pericarditis or traumatic myocarditis and die within hours or days. When the history supports a two-phased clinical disease, it is assumed the cow transiently \"felt better\" after the foreign body left the reticulodiaphragmatic area and entered the chest, thereby alleviating the peritoneal pain and inflammation. Subsequently, worsening sepsis in the pericardial sac and eventual heart failure causes the second phase of disease that generally moves the owner to seek veterinary consultation. 2. During the acute and subacute phases of traumatic pericarditis, heart sounds may change on a daily basis. Muffling, tinkling, splashing, rubs, murmurs, and other sounds all may be present on one day, absent the next, and present again later. Pathology is dynamic as the relative amounts of fibrin, purulent fluid, and gas in the pericardium change. Chronic cases, on the other hand, tend to have bilateral muffling of heart sounds and a \"far away\" tinkling as fluid pus is jostled by heartbeats.",

Heavy accumulation of fibrin coats the epicardium and visceral pericardium (Fig. 3.38 ). This fibrin frequently has the appearance of \"scrambled eggs\" when seen on postmortem examination (Fig. 3.39) . Depending on the severity and stage of the disease secondary ultrasonographic signs of cardiac tamponade can be observed with ventricular collapse during diastole, atrial collapse during ventricular systole or a \"swinging heart.\" Septic pericarditis (either traumatic after hardware disease or secondary to contiguous pulmonary infection), cardiac lymphosarcoma, and idiopathic hemorrhagic pericardial (IHP) effusion are the most common causes of pericardial effusion in cattle. In all cases, a pericardiocentesis under ultrasonographic guidance should be performed to characterize the nature of the pericardial effusion. Other physical examination and clinicopathologic data often heavily suggest the pathogenesis for each of these differentials, but definitive diagnosis is almost always provided by simple cytologic examination of a sample of the effusion. Pericardiocentesis can be performed with an 18-gauge, 8.75-cm spinal needle or chest trochar of similar length in the left fifth ICS.

Bacteria are easily detected in gram-stained smears of this fluid. With ultrasound guidance, as has become commonplace, it is frequently possible to access the pericardial sac from either the left or the right side (see Fig. 3 .31), potentially through several ICSs, so significant is the enlargement and volume of fluid within the pericardium. However, it is advisable that the fifth ICS on the left always be used for diagnostic sampling for cytology. Many cattle with pericardial effusions will also have some degree of pleural effusion, and it can be challenging to differentiate the two spaces ultrasonographically such is the deviation from normal anatomy and the sheer enlargement of the respective spaces. Although septic disease often has comparable cytology in both effusions, this is not always the case for neoplastic disease, nor with idiopathic hemorrhagic pericardial effusion. The major reason for pericardiocentesis is diagnostic differentiation of traumatic pericarditis from diseases that may create similar signs. Lymphosarcoma with pericardial involvement and fluid accumulation has historically been the major differential diagnosis, but increasing numbers of cases of idiopathic, nonseptic hemorrhagic pericarditis have been documented, in which the clinical signs are similar to those documented with septic pericarditis or neoplastic pericarditis, but the fluid tends to be a sterile hemorrhagic transudate with low to moderate numbers of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes (see Video Clip 3.5). Cytology of pericardial fluid would clearly differentiate between these diseases. The prognosis for cattle with the idiopathic hemorrhagic condition appears to be better after drainage and antiinflammatory therapy than for pericarditis associated with sepsis or neoplasia (see later section). The presence of flocculent, mixed echogenicity fluid with gas shadowing within the pericardium on ultrasonography is also characteristic for septic pericarditis.",

Sporadic case reports and third-hand stories attest to the occasional success of pericardiectomy and fifth rib resections, but success is not common. Authors recommending rib-splitting thoracotomy and pericardiectomy reported that five of nine clinical patients recovered.

However, we have observed patients with acute reticuloperitonitis and acute traumatic pericarditis from a single metallic foreign body that was still lodged in the reticulum and was removed through rumenotomy. These patients had clinically detectable pericardial effusions and radiographic evidence of foreign body penetration of the pericardium. Rumenotomy and intensive bactericidal systemic antibiotics are sometimes sufficient treatment of peracute or acute pericarditis in such cases. If pericarditis worsens despite systemic antibiotics and rumenotomy to retrieve the foreign body, thoracotomy may then be considered. Rumenotomy probably is most indicated in acute cases for which it is hoped that some portion of the metallic foreign object remains in the reticulum.

The initial reports of the condition were case reports or small case series of individual adult cattle presented to university teaching hospitals with signs of congestive heart failure associated with substantial volumes of hemorrhagic pericardial fluid. Diagnostic workup of these cases demonstrated that cytologically the effusion was neither neoplastic nor septic but merely hemorrhagic and that extended survival times could be achieved with pericardial drainage and parenteral corticosteroid administration. In many cases, the effusion would resolve with such treatment, and cattle would return to milk production or reproductive use for a variable period from several months to years. In the past decade, it has increased in prevalence to the point that at the time of writing, it is now the most common cardiac condition of cattle presenting to the University of Wisconsin's Large Animal Hospital. Subsequent literature has highlighted that many of these cattle go on to develop an unusual form of cardiac lymphosarcoma principally involving the epicardium in the months to years after initial presentation for cardiac disease. Occasionally, cattle have epicardial lymphosarcoma at the time of initial presentation, but we have seen cattle for whom the delay in progression from initial treatment of the nonneoplastic hemorrhagic pericardial effusion to euthanasia for epicardial lymphosarcoma has been in excess of 3 years. The gross appearance of the epicardial neoplasia is quite strikingly different to that seen with classic cardiac lymphosarcoma involving the myocardium. It seems extremely rare for cattle with cardiac lymphosarcoma to have neoplastic infiltration of both myocardial and epicardial locations, although both may show infiltration of thoracic or mediastinal lymph nodes locally. In cases when cattle have been euthanized or died with the disease, without any gross or histologic evidence of lymphosarcoma, the epicardial surface of the heart has a network of highly vascular fibroelastic connective tissue, which is presumably the source of the hemorrhagic effusion ( Fig. 3.40 ). Fulminant cases of epicardial lymphosarcoma have variably florid and highly extensive amounts of this highly vascular connective tissue within which it appears the neoplasia has developed, raising the possibility that it behaves as a \"scaffold\" for transformed lymphocytes (Figs. 3.41 and 3.42).

This is most readily achieved by echocardiography and pericardiocentesis. Routine hematology and biochemistry can be useful for exclusionary purposes in that there is an absence of hyperfibrinogenemia, mature neutrophilia, and hyperglobulinemia such as one would expect with septic pericarditis caused by hardware disease. There may well be a significant and persistent lymphocytosis in cattle with this condition who are also BLV positive, which may also be true in cases of right atrial lymphosarcoma. Biochemical abnormalities are infrequent, although many cattle demonstrate elevations in gamma-glutamyl transferase likely associated with passive hepatic congestion of cardiac origin. Pericardial fluid reliably appears bloody, typically has a packed cell volume (PCV) of between 10% and 15%, with a mildly elevated total protein, and a cytologic mixture of nondegenerate neutrophils, macrophages, and small lymphocytes. The latter usually represent the majority of the cells on cytologic examination even if the cow does not have a peripheral lymphocytosis. These small lymphocytes are phenotypically unremarkable in the majority of cases at the time of first diagnosis, but as mentioned earlier, over time this can transition into an obviously lymphoblastic population. Transabdominal ultrasound examination often confirms hepatic congestion, intrahepatic vessel prominence, and commonly a moderate degree of ascites. Thoracic ultrasonography and echocardiography are highly informative and the effusion(s) so marked that either a medium-frequency sector scanner or lower frequency cardiac probe can be used. Echocardiographic findings from either side of the chest include a large volume of predominantly anechoic fluid within the pericardial sac (5-25 cm in depth) (see Video Clip 3.7) often accompanied by a moderate but smaller volume of pleural fluid (see Fig. 3.4) . The latter is more likely in individuals with a particularly large volume of pericardial effusion. The epicardial surface of the heart is often coated with more hyperechoic-appearing tissue that projects like fronds of seaweed into the more anechoic fluid within the pericardium, having an ultrasonographic appearance reminiscent of fibrin. The anechoic nature of the pericardial fluid is notably different from that seen with septic pericardial disease, which tends to be more heterogeneous and frequently contains gas shadows (compare Figs. 3.4 and 3.37).

Severe chronic interstitial pulmonary disease, although rare, may also result in cor pulmonale in mature cattle with diffuse pulmonary fibrosis.

It is therefore worthwhile considering this differential whenever the clinician is presented with an adult cow (>2 years of age) that has a tachyarrhythmia (frequently atrial fibrillation) for which no other metabolic, GI, or toxic explanation is forthcoming.

Persistent atrial fibrillation raises concerns, lest the long-term condition lead to eventual heart failure. Heart failure has been suspected to result from prolonged (a course of years) atrial fibrillation in horses. Similar suspicions exist in cattle, but we know of no work that confirms this theory pathologically. In addition, cattle with atrial fibrillation that persists more than 1 month after resolution of a GI or medical problem may in fact have myocardial disease causing atrial fibrillation or acquire heart disease because the noncontracting atria will develop progressive dilation that eventually results in tricuspid and mitral valve regurgitation. It also is possible that some cows with persistent atrial fibrillation had it before the onset of their medical or GI disease. Therefore, discussions of appropriate criteria on which to base treatment are subjective. If medical or surgical therapy for the primary illness fails to resolve the atrial fibrillation, it is difficult to know how much the arrhythmia might contribute to any ongoing inappetence, depression, and decreased milk production. It seems that cattle, similar to horses, can be remarkably tolerant of chronic atrial fibrillation provided there is not concurrent, significant cardiac disease. The fact that chronic atrial fibrillation will ultimately lead to cardiomyopathic changes and deteriorating cardiac function means that there would be circumstances under which an attempt to convert cattle back to sinus rhythm should occur.",

Blood loss anemia and hemolytic anemia are \"regenerative anemias,\" and anemias caused by chronic disease are termed \"nonregenerative.\" Regenerative simply implies bone marrow response to anemia through increased erythropoiesis. Regenerative anemias in cattle frequently result in overt microscopic evidence of increased erythropoiesis such as increased anisocytosis, polychromasia, reticulocytosis, and occasionally even nucleated red blood cells (RBCs). In addition, an increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and decreased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) are typical in regenerative anemias.

A simplistic explanation of this phenomenon revolves around the fact that cattle have a limited bone marrow neutrophil pool to draw on in an acute emergency. Although the degenerative left shift remains a negative prognostic indicator and yet a consistent indicator of severe infection or endotoxemia, it is so typical in cattle that it must be tempered by the patient's signs and response to treatment before using it as the sole basis of a prognosis. Cattle that have a degenerative left shift will often have a return to normal neutrophil numbers within 4 to 7 days after successful treatment of their acute infection. This time lapse may simply reflect the time necessary for resolution of a severe infectious insult. If the infection requires more than 1 week for resolution, rebound neutrophilia usually will occur. Chronic infections may cause a neutrophilia, but many cattle with chronic infections such as visceral abscesses, musculoskeletal infections, chronic peritonitis, and other diseases, frequently have normal neutrophil numbers despite having obvious infection. Neutrophilia seems more likely in resolving acute or subacute infections than in chronic infection. Certainly, some cattle with chronic infections have neutrophilia, but the magnitude of the neutrophilia seldom is dramatic.

Although eosinopenia should accompany lymphopenia when the cause is stress or corticosteroid administration, eosinophil counts have limited value in this regard. Absolute lymphocytosis that is transient is rare in dairy cattle and when present usually is associated with a neutrophilia in patients recovering from acute infection. Lymphocytosis that is persistent and repeatable usually indicates infection with BLV. PL is a condition that develops in association with BLV infection in certain lines of cattle. The Bendixen method of control of BLV was based on elimination of cattle with PL until a more modern understanding of the disease evolved. This method proved successful because it was eventually determined that PL cows have greater levels of viremia than most BLV positive cows without PL and are the predominant virus spreaders within a herd. Cattle that are BLV positive and have PL may be at greater risk of developing lymphosarcoma than cattle that are BLV positive without PL, but this is controversial. In one study, PL was present in as many as one third of cattle infected with BLV. However, these percentages may vary in individual herds because genetic predispositions appear to affect the trait of PL in response to BLV infection. The lymphocytosis in cattle with PL is generally refractory to stress or corticosteroid treatment. Lymphocyte counts may range from 30,000/\u03bcL to 150,000/\u03bcL in cases of PL associated with BLV infection (Fig. 3.54) . True lymphocytic leukemia does occur in a very small percentage of cattle that develop lymphosarcoma after infection with BLV, and in such cases, lymphoblasts may be observed peripherally.",

Historically, textbooks have discussed the following as being consistent with the diagnosis of DIC: 1. Decreased platelet counts 2. Prolonged PT, APTT, and thrombin time 3. Elevated FDPs 4. Prolonged bleeding time 5. Decreased antithrombin III In human medicine a diagnostic algorithm can be used that allocates a numerical score based on the severity of abnormalities in platelet count, FDP (total FDP or D-dimer), PT prolongation, and fibrinogen concentration, alongside the presence of a primary disease known to be associated with DIC. Realistically, it is unusual to have all of these parameters satisfied in a bovine patient suspected of having DIC. For example, the PT and APTT may or may not be outside the normal reference range for the laboratory and if abnormal may be only slightly prolonged. In addition, FDP results in large animals with DIC usually fall in the intermediate (10-40 \u03bcg/mL FDP) or suspicious range rather than being obviously elevated. Decreased fibrinogen levels are not typical of DIC in cattle and if identified may actually suggest liver disease. Therefore, clinical cases of bovine DIC may only fulfill two or three of these parameters for diagnosis. Patients fitting many of the textbook parameters usually are in an advanced state and have a grave prognosis. Most bovine DIC patients have thrombocytopenia and intermediate FDP (10-40 \u03bcg/mL) results and may have slight prolongation of PT or APTT.",
