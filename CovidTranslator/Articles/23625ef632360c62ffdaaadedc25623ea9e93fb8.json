Delays in the identification of compatible donors are expected and represent a particular challenge when siblings are abroad. The use of home swab kits is a vital resource to enable HLA testing, particularly when access to hospitals for family is restricted. All future donors need to be tested for COVID-19. These aspects have recently been reviewed in detail elsewhere [6, 7] . Deferring allogeneic HSCT is recommended if possible; however, transmission from donor to recipient, either in the transfusion of blood products or cellular therapies, has not been yet reported [8] . Literature data on the impact of delayed transplant is ambiguous, obscured by differences in stem cell source and disease subtype. However, if a delay in transplant results in the reappearance of a significant minimal residual disease (MRD), a negative impact on survival is well established [9] . Furthermore, to ensure the possibility of the graft, EBMT strongly recommends securing stem cell product by freezing HSCs prior to conditioning, or to have a back-up donor [7]. It is not presently known if cryoconservation would negatively impact engraftment success; the use of less favorable stem cell sources in case of optimal donor unavailability might.",

Cancellation of elective surgery, and to a lesser extent, cessation of activities with confinement, help to reduce the need for blood products.

            "text": "Recently, the therapeutic landscape has evolved towards targeted therapies. They are used in addition to standard chemotherapy in fit patients, or as monotherapy in frail patients. The first breakthrough in AML therapy was represented by the approval of midostaurin for FLT3-mutated AML [12] . Princeps study, in addition to chemotherapy backbone, showed no difference in infectious complications or neutropenia [12] . The next-generation, more potent and selective FLT3 inhibitors quizartinib, crenolanib, gilteritinib are under clinical evaluation, showing similar profiles. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) inhibitors, ivosidenib or enasidenib may be active, in AML with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations, respectively [13] . Both inhibitors act as differentiating agents with the occurrence, in 10-20% of patients, of a differentiation syndrome, which requires prompt corticosteroid administration and often intensive care support. No information is yet available on the risk of severe respiratory failure in patients treated with these agents and exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Similar severe respiratory adverse effects frequently occur in patients with promyelocytic leukemia treated with arsenic trioxide (ATO) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), in the absence of chemotherapy. The association of chemotherapy and ATRA, as induction therapy, may be less risky during the pandemic, with the same survival benefit, than ATRA and ATO association [14, 15] . ATO could be used in consolidation therapy to achieve a low relapse rate [15] . Importantly, ivosidenib and ATO can both prolonged QTc increasing the risk for severe arrhythmia. Recently, non-randomized clinical trials reported a potential benefit for chloroquine on the prognosis of severe COVID-19. Other anti-viral drugs, such as remdesivir, are currently under study. As both of these drugs can also prolong QTc, clinicians should be aware of these potential severe adverse effects in COVID-19 patients treated with ATO, IDH inhibitor or any tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that may prolong QTc interval. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib) are currently included in the treatment of Philadelphia positive ALL, improving response rate and survival [16] . The addition of a TKI to chemotherapy and in maintenance after HSCT adds minimal infectious toxicity. However, the use of dasatinib in post-HSCT settings may increase the risk of CMV reactivation [17] , which in addition to adverse effects, such as pleural effusions and lung infiltrates, demands cautious use in the COVID-19 pandemic. Venetoclax is a highly selective, oral, B cell leukemia/ lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor with demonstrated efficacy in AML patients either alone or in combination with 5-azacitidine or decitabine [18] . However, prolonged neutropenia with increased risks of bacterial or fungal lung infections, is observed in AML patients treated with venetoclax [19] . Since this combined treatment is most frequently indicated in elderly AML patients unfit for intensive therapy and allogeneic transplantation, the risk of respiratory failure may be highly increased if they contract COVID-19.",
