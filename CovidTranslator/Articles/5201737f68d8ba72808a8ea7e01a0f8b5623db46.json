Retrospectively, patients were categorized into three groups based on disease severity: mild (no supportive treatment), moderate (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding), and severe (mechanical ventilation). clinical data, number of flow-defined leukocyte subsets, and cytokine concentrations were compared. results: children with severe RsV infection were characterized by young age; lymphocytopenia; increased interleukin (IL)-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-csF), and IL-6 concentrations; and decreased chemokine (c-c motif ) ligand (ccL-5) concentrations in plasma. The combination of plasma levels of IL-8 and ccL-5, and cD4 + T-cell counts, with cutoff values of 67 pg/ml, 13 ng/ml, and 2.3 \u00d7 10 6 /ml, respectively, discriminated severe from mild RsV infection with 82% sensitivity and 96% specificity. conclusion: This study demonstrates that the combination of cD4 + T-cell counts and IL-8 and ccL-5 plasma concentrations correlates with disease severity in RsV-infected children. In addition to clinical features, these immunological markers may be used to assess severity of RsV infection and guide clinical management.",

Among those sent home with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis, 4.6-6.8% required hospitalization later on during infection (9, 10) . Clinical prediction models may help clinicians to distinguish RSV-infected children requiring hospitalization from those who can be safely sent home. To date, mainly clinical parameters have been used to predict the severity of disease in RSV infection (11, 12) . Several studies have associated severity of RSV disease with particular cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, IL-4, and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 (13) (14) (15) (16) . A change in plasma or nasopharyngeal levels of these cytokines early in the host response can be used as early markers for severity of disease.

Despite the significantly higher IL-8, IL-6, and G-CSF and lower CCL-5 concentrations in plasma during severe RSV infection as compared with milder infection, in nasopharyngeal aspirates, only IL-6 was significantly higher during severe RSV infection. Given that nasopharyngeal samples do not necessarily reflect local inflammation in the lower airways (24) , and sampling methods and correction for dilutional effects differ between studies, the use of cytokines in nasopharyngeal samples as biomarkers is complicated.

The fact that not all studies examined recovery samples or evaluated disease severity may explain these differences. Although CCL-5 is initially produced by local innate immune cells to attract T cells and monocytes to the site of infection, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells have been described as the main source of the second peak of CCL-5, which occurs 5-7 d after infection (29) . A decrease in T cells may therefore result in lower CCL-5 levels. However, the discrepancy between T-cell counts and CCL-5 levels during recovery in the moderate and severe groups suggests that the lower T-cell counts cannot completely explain the lower CCL-5 levels during severe RSV infection. Other mechanisms such as an inadequate or suppressed T-cell response may play a role. Infection-induced immune suppression is a well-established phenomenon and has been described in sepsis, measles, and chronic viral infections (30) (31) (32) . The immature immune system of infants can also result in a reduced immune response. Controversial results have been published on changes in CCL-5 levels during the first months of life, and we cannot exclude that higher CCL-5 levels reflect functional maturation of the immune system (33, 34) . However, in infants within 3 mo of birth, we still observed significantly lower CCL-5 concentrations in ventilated infants than in nonventilated infants.",

It has been suggested that an IL-4-induced Th2 response during primary RSV infection might play a role in the development of atopic disease, although this could also be due to a shared etiology of bronchiolitis and asthma (36) . If this had played a role in our study, one would expect differences in IL-4-producing T-cell subsets or differences in the prevalence of atopic disease. However, no differences between severe and nonsevere patients were found. Therefore, it is unlikely that the inflammatory markers found to be associated with disease severity can be explained by the existing atopy or the development of atopic disease.",

Although comparing single RSV infections between ventilated and nonventilated children gave results similar to those of the analyses in which multiple infections were included, the possibility that the presence of other viruses induced a different inflammatory response cannot be entirely excluded. Another important consideration regarding markers for disease severity is that they do not have clinical implications at this moment, because currently no antiviral treatment is available. However, newly developed antiviral treatment of patients will be based most likely on diagnostics predicting disease severity and susceptibility (37, 38) . For the evaluation of intervention studies, such as vaccination and antiviral treatment, markers for disease severity will be valuable. Furthermore, given that we focused on the discrimination between ventilated and nonventilated children, studies need to be undertaken to determine whether this set of biomarkers could also discriminate between children requiring hospitalization and those who can be discharged.",

We conclude that prediction models of RSV infection in young children may be improved by including immunological parameters, such as IL-8 and CCL-5 concentrations and CD4 + T-cell counts. Future studies have to be performed to validate our findings to see whether the use of these parameters may contribute to early recognition of children developing severe RSV infection. This may guide clinicians to decide whether a child needs to be hospitalized and to initiate symptomatic therapy in an early phase of disease.",

The study was approved by the Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects of the University Nijmegen Medical Center, and written informed consent was obtained from all parents. Within 24 h after presentation, blood and nasopharyngeal samples were collected; and from hospitalized children, permission was asked of the parent or guardian for a recovery sample 4-6 wk later. Clinical data were collected from questionnaires and medical records. Retrospectively, based on the clinical course, patients were classified into three different groups: children without supportive interventions were allocated to the mild group; those requiring hospitalization for supplemental oxygen (oxygen saturations below 93%) and/or nasogastric feeding were allocated to the moderate group; and children requiring mechanical ventilation were allocated to the severe group.",

Leukocyte subsets were analyzed using immunofluorescence-labeled monoclonal antibodies determined in multicolor flow cytometry. Depending on the number of cells, 50 \u00b5l of cell suspension containing maximally 1 \u00d7 10 6 nucleated cells was incubated with 50 \u00b5l fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies (final dilution 1:20) for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. Combinations of mAb conjugates were used for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, CD45, CD14, and CD19 (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL). Cells were enumerated by using flow-count counting beads (Beckman Coulter). Staining of cells was determined by using a Fc500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Data were analyzed using the CXP software (Beckman Coulter).Immunophenotyping of cryopreserved PBMCs and intracellular cytokine staining were performed after thawing. The following combinations of markers and fluorescent antibodies were used: CD14-FITC, CD16.56-phycoerythrin, IL-4-PE, CD3-peridinin chlorophyll protein, CD19-allophycocyanin, IFN-\u03b3-allophycocyanin, CD4phycoerythrin-Cy7, and CD8-allophycocyanin-Cy7. Extracellular staining of surface markers CD14, CD16.56, CD3, CD4, and CD8 was performed in 96-well microtiter plates. For intracellular cytokine staining (IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3), PBMCs were stimulated with \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, phorbol myristate acetate (10 ng/ml), golgistop, and ionomycin at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h. Then, staining of surface markers CD3, CD4, and CD8 was performed. Thereafter, cells were fixed, permeabilized with 0.5% saponin and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained for intracellular IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3. Samples were acquired immediately after staining on a BD FACSCanto (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) and analyzed using flow cytometry analysis software (FlowJo analyses 7.6, Three Star, Ashland, OR).",

A two-sided value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.A receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted for those markers that were statistically different between severe and mild RSV infection. An optimal cutoff value for individual markers was then determined with a sensitivity approaching 100% and specificity >85%. If the diagnostic marker was unable to meet the above-mentioned criteria, the optimal cutoff value was adjusted so that both sensitivity and specificity approached 75%. With these optimal cutoff values, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of these markers or combination of markers were calculated. All statistical tests were performed by SPSS (Release 16; SPSS, Chicago, IL).",
