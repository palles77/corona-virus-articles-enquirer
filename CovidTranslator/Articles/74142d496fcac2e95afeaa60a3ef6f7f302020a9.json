            "text": "Rationale: Most asthma exacerbations are initiated by viral upper respiratory illnesses. It is unclear whether human rhinovirus (HRV)induced exacerbations are associated with greater viral replication and neutrophilic inflammation compared with HRV colds. Objectives: To evaluate viral strain and load in a prospective asthma cohort during a natural cold. Methods: Adults were enrolled at the first sign of a cold, with daily monitoring of symptoms, medication use, and peak expiratory flow rate until resolution. Serial nasal lavage and induced sputum samples were assessed for viral copy number and inflammatory cell counts. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 52 persons with asthma and 14 control subjects without atopy or asthma were studied for over 10 weeks per subject on average; 25 participants developed an asthma exacerbation. Detection of HRVs in the preceding 5 days was the most common attributable exposure related to exacerbation. Compared with other infections, those by a minor group A HRV were 4.4fold more likely to cause exacerbation (P \u00bc 0.038). Overall, sputum neutrophils and the burden of rhinovirus in the lower airway were similar in control subjects without atopy and the asthma group. However, among HRV-infected participants with asthma, exacerbations were associated with greater sputum neutrophil counts (P \u00bc 0.005). Conclusions: HRV infection is a frequent cause of exacerbations in adults with asthma and a cold, and there may be group-specific differences in severity of these events. The absence of large differences in viral burden among groups suggests differential lower airway sensitization to the effects of neutrophilic inflammation in the patients having exacerbations.",

Although symptomatic upper respiratory tract viral illnesses are the dominant risk factor in pediatric exacerbations, this link is less well established in adults (4) . One prospective cohort of 138 adult patients with asthma recruited at baseline and followed for over 1 year showed that 71% of adult exacerbations were preceded by upper respiratory symptoms (5) . Adults with asthma experience the same number of colds as their domestic partners without asthma, but are twice as likely to develop lower airway symptoms (6) . Numerous studies with enrollment at the time of exacerbation show association with respiratory viruses at a wide range of detection (26-78%) (5, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . The timing of sample acquisition in a natural infection may be critical, given that the intensity of cold symptoms in the first 2 days is more predictive of worsening asthma control than cold scores reported by participants after the second day (15) . In short, these challenges contribute to an incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma exacerbations in adults, and potentially hinder development of more effective treatments to be used specifically when asthma control is threatened (16) .",

            "text": "Although virus-induced asthma exacerbations are most frequently associated with rhinoviruses, not all colds result in exacerbations, highlighting interaction between the pathogen and host. Inoculation studies with laboratory strains of human rhinovirus (HRV) have demonstrated significant variability in the host immune responses to HRV infections (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) , although the magnitude and timing of this response in relation to the overall inflammatory profile is not resolved (24) (25) (26) . Neutrophilic inflammation of the lower airways has been demonstrated to be a feature of exacerbations (27, 28) ; however, less attention has been paid to the molecular virology of natural colds contributing to acute asthma. Sequence analysis demonstrates there are over 150 HRV strains (29) . Major HRVs bind to intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and include most of serogroup A and all of group B (30) (31) (32) . Minor HRV is a small subset of serogroup A that bind to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) (33) . HRV-C has been described more recently and does not appear to bind to either ICAM-1 or LDL-R. There is suggestion that the groups differ in pathogenicity, in that HRV-C infections were more commonly found in hospitalized children than other strains (34) (35) (36) . Moreover, several studies have shown that the lower airway can be infected by rhinovirus, but whether this potential exists differentially by strain has not been evaluated (37) (38) (39) (40) . As such, the objective of this study was to determine the relationships between acute asthma symptoms, HRV group, and lower airway viral burden in the setting of natural infections.",

Samples positive for rhinoviruses were partially sequenced (260-bp variable region in the 59 noncoding genome) to determine strain (34) . Quantitative PCR was then performed with a universal rhinovirus primer set using an ABI Prism 7,000 machine (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The oligonucleotide sequences for these primers are as follows: PCR forward primer, CTAGCCTGCGTGG (D110); PCR reverse primer, AAACA CGGACACCCAAAGTAGT (RVQ1); and probe, 6FAM-TCCTC CGGCCCCTGA-MGB-NFQ (RVQ2). These primers correspond to a conserved region of the 59 untranslated region, and were validated against 97 HRV strains, with further refinement after consideration of sequences from field strains, including HRV-C. As an estimate of viral burden similar to methods described previously (47) , HRV copy number was determined by extrapolation of real-time PCR data to a standard curve generated from a stock of HRV16 with known concentration in terms of plaque-forming units.",

The primary analysis plan also included comparison of the hazard rates of exacerbation for infection by different HRV groups, as well as comparisons of HRV copy number between groups of participants with asthma stratified by exacerbation status. Secondary endpoints included the development of a logistic regression model describing acute and postcold resolution factors predicting exacerbation status during the first four visits (see the online supplement for details), as well as comparisons of virus copy number and neutrophil count between all of the participants with asthma collectively to those values obtained from the nonatopic, nonasthmatic control group.

The severity of colds, duration of upper respiratory symptoms, qualitative detection of rhinovirus, and neutrophil influx were all associated with exacerbations. Upon recovery from the cold, the percent predicted FEV 1 /FVC ratio was the only variable that significantly related to exacerbation. Similar results were obtained in analyzing the asthma index as a continuous variable (data not shown). In addition, 33 of the 52 subjects with allergic asthma had upper respiratory symptoms that coincided with environmental exposure to relevant allergens. The rates of seasonal symptomatic allergen exposures did not differ according to exacerbation status (P \u00bc 0.581), nor did it change the duration of upper respiratory symptoms in subjects with asthma (14 6 7 versus 18 6 13 d, without and with seasonal exposure respectively; P \u00bc 0.220). Three subjects had exacerbations likely due to Alternaria sensitization and exposure in the absence of virus detection; however, the small number of patients in this group did not permit a reliable estimate of the hazard rate. Moreover, neither the change of sputum eosinophils or nor change in exhaled nitric oxide levels were predictive of exacerbations in the entire cohort (see the online supplement, including Table E2 ). Viral infections in the participants with asthma at any time during the study are enumerated by group. When viruses were detected during the acute visits, nearly all were present in the first sample (give number in first sample/total viruses detected), and the median duration of viral shedding was 10 days (interquartile range, 7-19 d). A total of 35 subjects had only 1 virus detected; 11 subjects had 2 and 1 subject experienced 3 infections during the course of the study, usually representing distinct colds. Five viral infections were asymptomatic. Viral illnesses that occurred before the first exacerbation are presented with the number of exacerbations, person-weeks of follow-up, and associated hazard rates. A proportional hazards model tested the differences between individual HRV groups. Finally, participants taking ICS before enrollment had a greater change in sputum eosinophils and a trend toward a higher sputum HRV copy number compared with subjects not taking ICS (Figure E2 ). By contrast, the change in exhaled nitric oxide levels did not differ according to the presence or absence of ICS use before the cold ( Figure E2 ).",

            "text": "The goals of this study were to determine whether rhinovirus colds were associated with distinct patterns of viral replication or neutrophilic airway inflammation in subjects with asthma, and to determine whether these same predictors correlated with exacerbations. Three-fourths of the colds in this study were due to rhinoviruses, and HRV exposure was the primary agent associated with exacerbation in the following 5 days. This rate is at the higher end of those reported in other studies (5, (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) , and may, in part, reflect recruitment strategies designed to enroll subjects at the first sign of a cold and before the exacerbation occurs. Data from the present study provide several novel insights. Foremost, the rate of exacerbations was 4.4-fold higher for group A minor HRV compared with all other groups combined, and may be the first study in adults with asthma to examine differences in HRV group pathogenicity. Published studies in children suggest that HRV-C may be more likely to cause severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization (34) (35) (36) 48) . HRV-C is more difficult to grow in culture, and does not appear to bind ICAM-1 or the LDL-R (49). Although we did not perform broad surveillance of adults for a complete profile of HRV strains in the community for each cold season, HRV group A has been shown to be more likely to have an increased symptom burden in general populations of adults (50, 51) . Collectively, these data suggest that there may be an age dependence to the intensity of the immune response to HRV, or that prior exposure to HRV-C may provide greater protection against subsequent exposure to this group in adults, in comparison with other HRV groups. Other potential mechanisms for varying HRV group pathogenicity that warrant further study include baseline differences in lower airway epithelial cell expression levels of ICAM-1, LDL-R, and the receptor for HRV-C, inconsistent effects of ICS on the expression of these receptors, and/or potential divergent signaling pathways, leading to production of chemokines and/or antiviral factors (52) (53) (54) .",

            "text": "The quantitative assessment of HRV copy number and associated lower airway inflammation in patients with asthma relative to control subjects without atopy or asthma has also not been previously shown during natural infections. We demonstrate that the HRV copy number in acute sputum samples from patients with asthma are not different when grouped according to exacerbation status; however, patients with HRV-associated exacerbations had greater than fivefold more neutrophils in their acute sputum samples than subjects with HRV colds, but no exacerbation. These data can be interpreted in several ways. First, it is likely that the variability in measuring HRV RNA copy number in a sputum sample is greater than that associated with neutrophil enumeration. In this sense, the present study may be underpowered to detect differences in lower airway HRV copy number that would be predicted if patients with asthma indeed have a relative deficiency in antiviral factors (22, 23) . Consistent with this notion is our observation that select patients with exacerbations have a sputum-to-peak nasal lavage HRV ratio greater than 1, suggestive of lower airway replication. In this light, it was interesting that post hoc analysis showed a trend toward increased sputum HRV copy number in patients previously taking ICS. Previous ICS use may be a marker for attenuated antiviral host factor production, and, similarly, administration of oral steroids has been shown to increase the nasal HRV titer during inoculation experiments, such that the increased burden may be an effect of the medicine (55) . Second, patients with exacerbations could have more robust recruitment and/or delayed clearance of neutrophils and other inflammatory cells from the lower airway in the setting of a similar viral challenge. With respect to the latter possibility, defects in alveolar macrophage phagocytosis have been associated with severe asthma phenotypes that are more exacerbation prone (56, 57) . Third, given that the control subjects who are HRV infected and nonatopic in the present study had similar sputum neutrophil counts to those from the patients with asthma, there are likely to be additional features of the asthmatic lower airway that contribute to the exacerbation phenotype. Collectively, these observations will need validation in a larger cohort, with the goal of identifying biomarkers related to the risk of exacerbations during natural infections. Quantitative PCR was performed using universal HRV primers on all available acute samples from all participants with a detected rhinovirus (A), stratified by the presence or absence of an exacerbation occurring within 5 days of collection of the sputum sample (which occurred on Cold Day 5 6 2 in the acute period). The sputum HRV burden is expressed as a ratio to the peak occurring in the NL samples. Chisquared analysis was done for the rates of having more HRV copies in the sputum sample than in the peak of the NL, with sample sizes of 13 and 14, respectively. (B) The absolute number of neutrophils per gram of sputum during the acute visit. Sputum neutrophil data from all subjects with asthma are shown regardless of virus detection (n \u00bc 28 and 19, respectively). Data were log transformed before ANOVA testing.

            "text": "Clearly, the timing of respiratory sample collection is critical in a natural infection and, as such, our study design had a number of strengths and some limitations that should be considered in interpreting these findings. To fully characterize the effects of the acute illness, all participants completed four study visits within the first 14 days after the onset of cold symptoms. That the cold symptom scores in all participants continued to rise during the early visits, the peak nasal lavage HRV copy number occurred on the third day of cold symptoms (similar to that observed in inoculation experiments (26)), and lung function at the first visit was not different between patients with asthma with or without exacerbation, all suggest that our recruiting efforts enrolled a preexacerbation population. Nonetheless, it is possible that some of the acute samples were collected after peak inflammation. The ability to test multiple samples of respiratory secretions with sensitive and comprehensive PCR-based viral diagnostics (58) adds to the validity of identifying viral illnesses. Furthermore, HRVpositive samples were confirmed by sequencing and molecular typing, which allowed for analysis of group-specific effects. In contrast, previous work by others identified female sex, race, peak expiratory flow variability, lack of use of ICS, and a history of treatment with oral corticosteroid, such as prednisone, as independent risk factors for the incidence and severity of asthma exacerbations (1, 2, 59) . These factors were not significant in the present study, and may reflect a limitation of our sample size and mild baseline disease impairment. Of note, 36 of the initial 84 patients with asthma (42.9%) had required prednisone and/or advanced medical care during episodes before the current study, demonstrating that our recruiting strategy captured an at-risk population. Our entry criteria required an FEV 1 > 70% predicted at the first visit, and an absence of baseline use of highdose ICS or prednisone to ensure safety during the complex visit structure and procedural burden. As such, our findings may not apply to those with more severe asthma, although this population will clearly be of interest in terms of the potential interactions between corticosteroids and viral burden. Use of recently adapted nasal sample collection methods at home (47) may allow us to enroll patients in future protocols with a greater spectrum of disease severity and fewer dedicated study visits.",

Relative to participants with asthma experiencing an HRV cold only, subjects with exacerbations have higher sputum neutrophil counts and an increased chance of having more HRV detected in the sputum compared with the nasal samples. Ongoing work in several laboratories is focused on the identity of rhinovirus species or sequence elements that confer the most pathogenic risk. Additional study is also warranted regarding the mechanisms by which allergic inflammation influences the antiviral response and/or sensitizes the lower airway to injury associated with neutrophilic influx.",
