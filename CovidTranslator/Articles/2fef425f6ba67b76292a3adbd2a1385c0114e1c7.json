Traditional sequence alignment methods are not suitable and there is a need for fast alignment-free techniques for sequence analysis. Information theory and data compression algorithms provide a rich set of mathematical and computational tools to capture essential patterns in biological sequences. In 2013, our research group (Nagaraj et al., Eur. Phys. J. Special Topics 222(3-4), 2013) has proposed a novel measure known as Effort-To-Compress (ETC) based on the notion of compression-complexity to capture the information content of sequences. In this study, we propose a compression-complexity based distance measure for automatic identification of SARS coronavirus strains from a set of viruses using only short fragments of nucleotide sequences. We also demonstrate that our proposed method can correctly distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1 viruses by analyzing very short segments of nucleotide sequences. This work could be extended further to enable medical practitioners in automatically identifying and characterizing SARS coronavirus strain in a fast and efficient fashion using short and/or incomplete segments of nucleotide sequences. Potentially, the need for sequence assembly can be circumvented.",

Finding a vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for such global pandemic of virus diseases requires rapid analysis, annotation and evaluation of metagenomic libraries to enable quick and efficient screening of nucleotide sequences. Traditional sequence alignment methods are not suitable since they are computationally intensive and cannot be easily scaled up as the number of sequences increase. Thus, there is a need for fast alignment-free techniques for sequence analysis [3, 4] . Further, one may have only short segments and/or incomplete fragments of nucleotide sequences to analyze [5] . Information theory and data compression algorithms provide a rich set of mathematical and algorithmic/computational tools to capture essential patterns in data that could be used for matching nucleotide sequences.

Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZ), a popular and widely used complexity measure, estimates the degree of compressibility of an input sequence. Effort-To-Compress, a more recently proposed complexity measure (by our research group), determines the number of steps required by the Non-Sequential Recursive Pair Substitution Algorithm to compress the input sequence to a constant sequence (or a sequence of zero entropy). It should be noted that both LZ and ETC are complexity measures derived from lossless data compression algorithms (hence we term them as compression-complexity measures). It has been demonstrated that both LZ and ETC outperform Shannon Entropy in characterizing complexity of noisy time series of short length arising out of stochastic (markov) and chaotic systems [37, 39, 40] . Further, ETC consistently performs better than LZ in a number of applications as shown in recently published literature [39] [40] [41] [42] . For details of how to compute LZ and ETC on actual input sequences, we refer the readers to [22, 37, 43] .",

Further speed up can be obtained by parallelizing the analysis on individual short segments. Potentially, the need for sequence assembly can be completely circumvented.",
