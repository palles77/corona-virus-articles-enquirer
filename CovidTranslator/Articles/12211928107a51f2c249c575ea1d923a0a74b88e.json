            "text": "Background: Communicable disease crises can endanger the health care system and often require special guidelines. Understanding reasons for nonadherence to crisis guidelines is needed to improve crisis management. We identified and measured barriers and conditions for optimal adherence as perceived by 4 categories of health care professionals. Methods: In-depth interviews were performed (n 5 26) to develop a questionnaire for a cross-sectional survey of microbiologists (100% response), infection preventionists (74% response), public health physicians (96% response), and public health nurses (82% response). The groups were asked to appraise barriers encountered during 4 outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Clostridium difficile ribotype 027, rubella, and avian influenza) according to a 5-point Likert scale. When at least 33% of the participants responded ''strongly agree,'' ''agree,'' or ''rather agree than disagree,'' a barrier was defined as ''often experienced.'' The common (''generic'') barriers were included in a univariate and multivariate model. Barriers specific to the various groups were studied as well. Results: Crisis guidelines were found to have 4 generic barriers to adherence: (1) lack of imperative or precise wording, (2) lack of easily identifiable instructions specific to each profession, (3) lack of concrete performance targets, and (4) lack of timely and adequate guidance on personal protective equipment and other safety measures. The cross-sectional study also yielded profession-specific sets of often-experienced barriers. Conclusion: To improve adherence to crisis guidelines, the generic barriers should be addressed when developing guidelines, irrespective of the infectious agent. Profession-specific barriers require profession-specific strategies to change attitudes, ensure organizational facilities, and provide an adequate setting for crisis management.",

            "text": "In outbreak situations that endanger the health care system, outbreak control measures must be initiated promptly to prevent further transmission of the pathogen. In such situations, authoritative guidance is needed. Countries all over the world have established their own structures to disseminate outbreak control guidelines and, if necessary, put outbreak control systems in place. In a crisis, health care professionals with diverse backgrounds need to work quickly together to identify cases, perform laboratory diagnostics, trace contacts, and institute infection prevention and control measures as described in the outbreak control guidelines. 1 Optimal compliance with the guidelines, with timely and adequate outbreak control as final outcome, requires good adherence by professionals. Unfortunately, however, their adherence is often not optimal, 2-5 due to knowledge, attitudes, and behavior among professionals, 6, 7 as well as to organizational and other factors. Guidelines are not always clear, and existing facilities are not always adequate or adaptable to the sudden intrusion of crisis measures. A systematic review conducted by Cabana et al 8 revealed a variety of barriers that hinder adherence. The authors provide a generic framework for exploring barriers in various settings. According to the authors, barriers to adherence include those related to the professionals, with a more cognitive (knowledge, awareness) or affective (attitude, motivation) component, those related to the guidelines (their content and target patient population), and those related to the environment (organization, social setting). 8 Many studies have looked at determinants of adherence to guidelines in the routine care of infectious disease, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] but little is known about determinants of adherence to guidelines in crisis situations. 15, 16 Crisis situations differ significantly from routine communicable disease control, because health professionals must respond with prompt decisions, uniformity of action, and quick integration of new knowledge and skills. Furthermore, the context of crisis situations is complex, requiring optimal communication and cooperation between public health services and hospitals. A better understanding of the reasons for nonadherence of health care professionals in crises situations is needed to improve crisis management. Identification of generic and profession-specific barriers can lead to customized strategies designed to make guidelines work.",

Our participants agreed that such targets will increase the internal motivation to adopt the measures and also enable readjustment of expectations when necessary. Finally, there is the issue of professional safety. More than in other fields of health care, dealing with outbreaks raises major concerns with respect to personal safety and prevention of nosocomial spread. In crises, especially when facing a new pathogen, health care professionals expect immediate information on which infection control procedures to put in place. Timely, solid guidance for health care professionals on ways to minimize their own risk by wearing PPE and complying with safety instructions will increase not only their protection, but also their confidence and motivation. 21, 22 Apart from motivation, beliefs, and attitudes, adherence to individual protective measures also depends on organizational factors. 16, 23, 24 According to Gershon et al, 24 a safety climate characterized by a strong organizational commitment to safety leads to increased compliance with the use of PPE.

However, they studied adherence to guidelines in routine care situations and had access to previous publications when constructing their framework of barriers. Given that no systematic research has been published on barriers in times of crisis, we needed indepth interviews to explore these barriers and build the baseline framework. This qualitative approach enabled optimal exploration of hidden reasons for nonadherence. We were able to describe patterns of barriers that influence adherence, together with more individual specific constraints. Because the reported barriers might be different from those observed during outbreaks, they should be regarded as a proxy for reality.

To improve adherence of these professionals in outbreak crises, priority should be given to the 4 generic barriers that we have described, irrespective of the infectious agent involved.
