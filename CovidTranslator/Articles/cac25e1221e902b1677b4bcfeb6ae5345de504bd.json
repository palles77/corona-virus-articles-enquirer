In cells infected with the prototype negative strand virus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), inhibiting Hsp90 activity reduced viral replication in cells infected at both high and low multiplicities of infection. This inhibition was observed using two Hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycin and radicicol. Silencing of Hsp90 expression using siRNA also reduced viral replication. Hsp90 inhibition changed the half-life of newly synthesized L protein (the large subunit of the VSV polymerase) from >1 hour to less than 15 minutes without affecting the stability of other VSV proteins. Both the inhibition of viral replication and the destabilization of the viral L protein were seen when either geldanamycin or radicicol was added to cells infected with paramyxoviruses SV5, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, or SV41, or to cells infected with the La Crosse bunyavirus. Based these results we propose that Hsp90 is a host factor that is important for the replication of many negative strand viruses.",

            "text": "There is significant scientific and public health interest in viruses that utilize negative strand RNA as genomes. Many of these viruses are important pathogens, including some of the most significant recurring infectious disease problems (influenza, respiratory syncytial virus) as well as some of the most alarming emerging infectious diseases (Lassa, Marburg, Hanta, Rift Valley Fever). All of these viruses encode an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP). The RDRP is required both for viral transcription and for replication of the viral genome (Whelan, Barr, and Wertz, 2004) . In addition to RNA polymerization, the RDRPs are also involved in 5' and 3' end modification and in recognizing cis-acting sequences that govern transcription and replication. Functionally, RDRPs from different viruses appear to utilize diverse strategies to accomplish these tasks, but a repeating theme is that the RDRP requires either cooperating viral proteins (Gupta, Shaji, and Banerjee, 2003; Whelan, Barr, and Wertz, 2004) or host proteins (Das et al., 1998; Shen and Masters, 2001 ; Strauss and Strauss, 1999) to properly accomplish replication and/or transcription. Understanding these virus/virus and virus/host interactions that govern negative strand virus replication are important for developing ways to combat important infectious agents by blocking their ability to replicate.",

Knockout models have shown that Hsp90 is essential for viability in yeast and Drosophila (Lange et al., 2000; Panaretou et al., 1998; Rutherford and Lindquist, 1998) . Hsp90 displays ATP-dependent folding capacity (Panaretou et al., 1998) , and is notable among chaperone proteins because unlike its promiscuous cousin chaperone HSP70 (Agashe and Hartl, 2000) , Hsp90 appears to have a specific set of client proteins in vivo (Pratt and Toft, 2003) . These client proteins include steroid receptors, a number of transcription factors, and several protein kinases (Terasawa, Minami, and Minami, 2005) . Hsp90 forms a complex with co-chaperones (i.e. AHA1, Hop/Sti1, FKBP51 and 52) which then act to fold client proteins. Several known oncogenes are client proteins of Hsp90 (Pratt and Toft, 2003) , which has sparked interest in using Hsp90 inhibitors to block the folding of these oncogenic proteins in an effort to drive cancer cells into apoptosis (Whitesell and Lindquist, 2005) .",

During vaccinia virus infection, Hsp90 inhibition blocks viral replication (Hung, Chung, and Chang, 2002) . The mechanism for this inhibition is not well established, but Hsp90's localization is restricted to the cytoplasm following VV infection, where it interacts with the viral core protein 4a, presumably as a client protein (Hung, Chung, and Chang, 2002) . Hsp90 activity has also been reported to be important for proper cleavage of newly synthesized hepatitis C NSP2/3 protein (Waxman et al., 2001) , and is required for the activity of the hepatitis B reverse transcriptase (Hu and Seeger, 1996; Hu, Toft, and Seeger, 1997) .",

In Herpes virus infection, blocking Hsp90 activity significantly inhibited viral replication (Burch and Weller, 2005; Li et al., 2004) , possibly due to the improper localization of the viral polymerase in drug-treated cells (cytoplasmic rather than nuclear). Similarly, it has been shown that Hsp90 activity is important for the proper stability and localization of the RNA polymerase (protein A) of the insect virus flock house virus (Kampmueller and Miller, 2005) .",

In an attempt to address this question, we have studied the effects of Hsp90 inhibitors on the replication of several different negative strand RNA viruses from the rhabdovirus, paramyxovirus, and bunyavirus families. We found that replication of viruses from each of these families was impaired by the ansamycin Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin, a second Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol, and by siRNA knockdown of Hsp90 protein levels. This inhibition of replication was most apparent at early stages of the virus life cycle and resulted in the selective destabilization of the L protein of the virus polymerase. Based on this and other data in the literature, we propose that viruses from multiple families and classes have all evolved to require the use of Hsp90 for the proper folding of their polymerases. This suggests that the inhibition of Hsp90 activity could act as broad-range antiviral agents.",

We utilized chemically synthesized geldanamycin (provided by the DTP service of NCI) in these experiments because a recent report has shown that geldanamycin purified from S. hygroscopicus contains contaminating activities that inhibit intracellular trafficking but that the NCI synthesized compound does not (Barzilay et al., 2004) . BHK cells infected with VSV at an MOI of 0.01 were treated with increasing concentrations of drug, and virus yield at 12hpi was determined by plaque assay. As shown in Figure 1A , geldanamycin was a potent inhibitor of VSV growth, reducing virus replication by 3 orders of magnitude at 100nM and 5 orders of magnitude at 5\u03bcM.",

As shown in Figure 1B , geldanamycin had a significant effect on slowing virus growth in a single cycle growth experiment (MOI=10). Cells that were infected with VSV and treated with geldanamycin showed a noticeable delay in virus growth, producing lower virus titers between 4 and 16 hpi when compared to cells infected with VSV but not treated with geldanamycin. By 24hpi, virus titers were comparable between drug treated and untreated conditions. Inhibition of VSV replication by geldanamycin was seen in HeLa cells as well as in BHK cells (data not shown), indicating that this effect was not cell-type specific. Inhibition of viral replication by geldanamycin was more dramatic in multi-cycle growth experiments. Geldanamycin addition delayed the appearance of progeny viruses for 8 hours when compared to infected cells that were not treated with geldanamycin, and inhibited growth by more than two orders of magnitude at 24hpi ( Figure 1C ). We also determined the effect of radicicol, an Hsp90 inhibitor that is structurally distinct from geldanamycin, on high MOI VSV infection. Radicicol also inhibited VSV replication, decreasing virus titers by more than 2 orders of magnitude at 4hpi and 4 orders of magnitude at 8hpi. This supports the hypothesis that the mechanism of replication inhibition is through the inhibition of Hsp90 function ( Figure 1D ).",

Cells transfected with siRNA targeting the alpha and beta forms of Hsp90 showed an 80-90% drop in Hsp90 levels at the same time posttransfection (lanes [3] [4] [5] [6] . Cell cultures transfected with either GAPDH or Hsp90 siRNA had fewer cells than contols at 72h posttransfection suggesting that cell proliferation was slowed (Supplemental Figure 1) . However, there were no significant differences in cell viability or gross morphological changes in cells transfected with Hsp90 siRNA. To determine the effect of the lower levels of Hsp90 protein levels on VSV infection, cells were infected with VSV at a low MOI (0.01). Analysis of viral growth by plaque assay (figure 1F) showed that cells where Hsp90 was silenced showed a decrease in virus titer compared to a mock-transfected control at both 8 and 24hpi, but that there was a negligible effect of GAPDH silencing on virus titer. These results support the conclusion that Hsp90 is an important host factor in the replication of VSV.",

In a single-cycle growth experiment, drug added coincident with infection had a strong effect on viral replication, but drug added four hours postinfection had almost no effect (data not shown). This suggested that the antiviral activity of geldanamycin was due to an effect on an early, ratelimiting step of viral replication. To determine how the addition of geldanamycin affected viral gene expression, cells were infected with VSV and drug was added at 0, 2 or 4hpi (see figure  2A for time line). At 5hpi, cells were labeled with 35 S methionine for 1 hour and lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. In cells that were not treated with drug, high level VSV gene expression was evident through the appearance of four major bands representing the L, G, N/P (comigrating), and M proteins ( Figure 2B , lane 1). Also apparent was the inhibition of host protein synthesis normally seen following a productive VSV infection. Addition of geldanamycin coincident with virus infection blocked viral gene expression by VSV, but host protein synthesis was still detectable (lane 2). Cells treated with drug 2hpi showed some decrease in viral gene expression, and cells treated with drug at 4hpi showed strong viral gene expression, demonstrating that geldanamycin inhibition of viral gene expression required addition soon after initiating the infection. As shown in Figure 2B , the addition of drug at 4hpi did result in one change from non-treated cells: the viral L protein, the catalytically active component of the RDRP accumulated to much lower levels in these drugtreated cells.",

At 4hpi, infected cells were treated with 50nM, 500nM or 5\u03bcM geldanamycin, proteins were labeled with 35 S methionine for 1 hour and the fate of the newly synthesized proteins were determined through analysis of virions budded into the supernatant and labeled protein in the cell after a 1 hour chase with unlabeled methionine. While most proteins produced by VSV were unaffected by addition of geldanamycin, the level of L protein in cell lysates decreased with increasing geldanamycin concentration ( Figure 3A ). Drug addition at concentrations as low as 50nM decreased the amount of L in lysates, consistent with the disappearance of the L protein being linked to the effect of the drug on viral replication ( Figure 1A ). In budded virions purified from the supernatant of these same cells the concentration of geldanamycin did not have an effect on the amounts of radiolabeled G,N,P, and M protein were incorporated ( Figure 3B ), demonstrating that blocking Hsp90 does not affect any of the assembly function of the virus. In the case of the L protein, less radiolabeled L protein was incorporated into virions as geldanamycin concentration increased. This result shows that geldanamycin treatment did not result in the preferential movement of newly synthesized L protein into virions. Some newly synthesized L was found in virions from cells treated with lower concentrations of drug, indicating that some of the newly synthesized L protein remains in the cell long enough to be incorporated into virions.",

The resulting image showed that in both geldanamycintreated and untreated cells infected with virus, significant amounts of 35 S methionine were incorporated into the viral L protein. The newly synthesized L protein was stable in untreated cells but disappeared rapidly in cells treated with the drug and was almost completely absent after a 30 minute chase. Quantitation of these data (figure 4B) over multiple experiments showed that the half-life of the L protein was greater than 60 minutes in the absence of drug but was reduced to less than 20 minutes in the presence of drug.

This possibility is particularly plausible because other Hsp90 substrates, such as the estrogen receptor, have been shown to be shunted to the proteasome pathway following Hsp90 inhibition (Bagatell et al., 2001; Fan, Park, and Nephew, 2005) . To test whether the proteasome is involved in the degradation of newly synthesized L protein, we repeated the experiments shown in Figure 4 , but added proteasome inhibitor (proteasome inhibitor II, Calbiochem) to infected cells treated with geldanamycin. At 10 minutes of chase, there were similar levels of incorporation of 35S methionine into L protein in untreated, geldanamycin treated, and geldanamycin + proteasome inhibitor treated conditions ( Figure 5A ). At 30 minutes chase there was a significant decrease in the amount of L protein in the geldanamycin treated cells similar to that seen in previous experiments. There was a much smaller decrease in the cells treated with both geldanamycin and proteasome inhibitor showing that proteasome inhibition decreased the degradation of the L protein. Addition of proteosome inhibitor alone did not significantly alter the stability of the L protein ( Figure 5B ). The quantitation of multiple experiments ( Figure 5C) showed that the addition of the proteasome inhibitor increased L protein half-life in the presence of geldanamycin from less than 20 minutes to close to that of L in control cells that did not recieve geldanamycin (dotted line, Figure 5B ). This argues that the primary cause of the disappearance of the newly synthesized L polymerase following Hsp90 inhibition is the targeting of the newly synthesized polymerase to the proteasome.",

To determine the effect of Hsp90 inhibition on viral replication, geldanamycin was added to cells that were infected at a low multiplicity with a GFP-expressing SV5 (rSV5-GFP) or HPIV-2.

Mechanistically, geldanamycin and other Hsp90 inhibitors appear to block virus replication by dramatically decreasing the stability of the L subunit of the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase. This mode of action would explain the effectiveness of Hsp90 inhibition at early stages of viral infection where the level of RNA synthesis and genome replication would be most affected by decreased levels of the viral polymerase. Adding geldanamycin at progressively later times postinfection has progressively less effect on viral gene expression, indicating that accumulation of L protein prior to drug addition can compensate for the rapid turnover of newly synthesized L protein. Our studies show that viruses from the rhabdovirus, paramyxovirus, and bunyavirus families all require Hsp90 activity to achieve normal levels of a stable viral polymerase. Other researchers have shown that the positive-strand RNA virus FHV polymerase (Kampmueller and Miller, 2005) and the influenza virus polymerase (Momose et al., 2002) require Hsp90 activity for proper function. Together, our data and that from other laboratories (Kampmueller and Miller, 2005; Momose et al., 2002) suggest that Hsp90 is a host factor that is of central importance to viral replication for many, if not all, RNA viruses. The RNA polymerases from these different viruses do not share a high degree of sequence homology, so their dependence on Hsp90 points to convergent evolution. To our knowledge we are the first to propose that Hsp90 activity is a conserved requirement for achieving a stable virus polymerase for a wide spectrum of RNA viruses.",

This is also likely true of the other viral polymerases affected by Hsp90 inhibition, as the viruses used in this study all have relatively large polymerase proteins (~240kDa) that are likely to have independent functional domains. How Hsp90 is involved in folding these polymerases has yet to be determined, but because Hsp90's protein folding activity requires the binding and action of additional co-chaperones the folding of viral polymerases is likely to be a coordinated effort of several cellular proteins, of which Hsp90 is the first to be identified.",

For viruses of the rhabdovirus and paramyxovirus families, the L polymerase requires the binding of the viral phospho (P) protein for activity (Horikami et al., 1992) . Hsp90 may facilitate the L-P interaction to promote the stability of L. Hsp90 could also act to promote the stable formation of L protein multimers (Smallwood, Cevik, and Moyer, 2002) . Thus, Hsp90 inhibition could lead to a disruption of L-L interactions resulting in an unstable polymerase that is quickly degraded. Additionally, Hsp90 may be more remotely involved and impact L stability by folding or activating a cellular component that is required for polymerase stability. Further experiments will be required to determine the interaction between Hsp90 and RNA virus polymerases, as well as other cellular factors",

            "text": "The importance of Hsp90 for the replication of multiple viruses opens an interesting possibility for developing new antiviral therapies. There are few compounds that display antiviral activity against major encephalitis-causing and hemorrhagic fever causing negative strand RNA viruses (De Clercq, 2005;Domachowske and Rosenberg, 2005). Our findings suggest that the inhibition of Hsp90 activity should be investigated as a mechanism of limiting the replication and spread of these viruses in vivo. An advantage of this approach is that the lack of Hsp90 activity appears to hamper viral RDRP function. The RDRP represents a rate limiting enzyme step in virus replication that performs many unique and essential replication functions and is synthesized at relatively low levels in infected cells. Additionally, because of the effectiveness of this compound against a wide variety of viruses, Hsp90 inhibitors may be broad spectrum antivirals capable of inhibiting the replication of several different infectious agents. Already, significant effort has been devoted to developing Hsp90 inhibitors. One of these compounds, 17-AAG (a geldanamycin derivative) has completed phase 1 and is currently in phase 2 clinical trials as an anticancer therapy (Goetz et al., 2005; Whitesell and Lindquist, 2005) . Results from phase 1 trials showed that tolerated doses of the drug led to decreases in the levels of Hsp90 client proteins (Banerji et al., 2005; Grem et al., 2005) . Thus, this compound has already passed many of the hurdles that confront successful drug development, and it or other Hsp90 inhibitors in development (Whitesell and Lindquist, 2005 ) are likely to be clinically viable. Regardless of their utility in cancer treatment, we propose that further experimentation should be undertaken to determine wither these compounds have a useful role as antiviral agents. Hsp90 inhibitors may also work synergistically with other antivirals such as ribavirin, a drug that has also been suggested to target the function of the viral polymerase (Graci and Cameron, 2002 ).",

Geldanamycin or radicicol was added after attachment of virus to cells, and was maintained throughout growth experiments. GFP expressing cells were analyzed with the Nikon Eclipse microscope and a 20X objective. Images were captured using a QImaging digital camera and processed using QCapture software. Exposure times were manually set to be constant between samples. For radiolabeling experiments, cells were treated with Geldanamycin for 1 hr prior to radiolabeling with Tran 35 S-label (100 uCi/ml), lysed in SDS and used for immunoprecipitation analysis with polyclonal antibodies specific for the SV5 NP, P, or L proteins as described previously (Parks, Ward, and Rassa, 2001 ).",
