Here, we show that BAG3 down-modulation resulted in reduced cell viability and enhanced PEITC-induced apoptosis largely more extensively in HeLa (HPV18 + ) rather than in C33A (HPV \u2212 ) cervical carcinoma cell lines. Moreover, we demonstrate that BAG3 suppression led to a decrease of viral E6 oncoprotein and a concomitant recovery of p53 tumor suppressor, the best recognized target of E6 for proteasome degradation. E6 and p53 expression were modulated at protein level, since their respective mRNAs were unaffected. Taken together our findings reveal a novel role for BAG3 as host protein contributing to HPV18 E6-activated pro-survival strategies, and suggest a possible relevance of its expression levels in drug/radiotherapy-resistance of HPV18-bearing cervical carcinomas.",

            "text": "High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the major risk factor of a large number of human cancers, among which the most prevalent is cervical cancer. HPV subtypes 16 and 18 are the most carcinogenic and are responsible for the majority of cervical cancer cases [1] . HPV-encoded oncoproteins E5, E6 and E7 are the primary viral factors responsible for initiation and progression of cervical cancer. They act largely by overcoming negative growth regulation by host cell proteins and by inducing genomic instability ( [2] and references therein). E5 has lower transforming activity than E6 and E7, but it is able to potentiate the activity of the other two viral oncoproteins during the early steps of viral infection/transformation. E6 and E7 act in combination to promote degradation by proteasome of proteins involved in cell cycle arrest and DNA damage sensing/ repair and of pro-apoptotic proteins as well. The first and best characterized proteins targeted by E7 for proteasome degradation are tumor suppressor proteins of the pRB family, which in turn leads to the increase of p53 and apoptosis [3] . E6 counteracts p53 elevation by targeting it for proteasome degradation mainly through association with cellular ubiquitin ligase E6-associated protein (E6AP) [4] . Moreover, HPV oncoproteins have been shown to up-regulate several proteins important for cancer development [5] . Such complex network of interactions between high-risk HPV viral proteins and host proteins ultimately results in a host cell survival advantage nec-essary for virus replication and cancer development ( [2, [6] [7] [8] and references therein).",

            "text": "The anti-apoptotic cellular machinery includes several proteins, among which is the BAG family molecular chaperone regulator 3 (BAG3). BAG3 protein is a member of the human BAG family of molecular co-chaperone proteins. All BAG proteins contain an evolutionarily conserved domain (BAG domain), through which they bind to heat shock protein cognate 70/heat-shock protein 70 (Hsc70/ Hsp70) ATPase domain and to other partners (steroid hormone receptors, RAF-1, and others) ( [9] and references therein). In addition, BAG3 contains a WW domain, a proline-rich region (PXXP), and two conserved IPV (Ile-Pro-Val) motifs, that can mediate binding to other proteins. Due to the presence of several protein-protein interaction domains in its structure, BAG3 is implicated in several cellular processes, including cell survival, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis [10, 11] . bag3 gene expression, which is constitutive only in a few normal cell types (e.g. skeletal muscle and heart), can be induced by stressors, such as oxidants, high temperature, and serum deprivation in other normal cell types. The pro-survival role of BAG3 is signified by its over-expression in several human tumors (e.g. pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and leukemia), where it appears to exert an anti-apoptotic role [12] . Recent studies demonstrated that BAG3 is required for efficient growth of different viruses, including varicella-zoster virus [13] , HIV-1 [14] , Epstein-Barr virus [15] , herpes simplex virus [16] , polyomavirus JC [17] , SARS-CoV [18] , and adenovirus [19] . Moreover, we recently demonstrated a positive correlation between BAG3 expression and the presence of Bovine Papilloma Virus in equine sarcomas [20] .",

The blot in Fig. 1A shows that BAG3 is expressed in both cell line, even though to a higher extent in HeLa cells. BAG3 was efficiently down-modulated in both HeLa and C33A cells using a BAG3-specific siRNA (BAG3siRNA). In Fig. 1A (lower panels) we reported only the timedependent reduction of BAG3 expression in HeLa cells as representative of results obtained in C33A cells. At 50 h and 72 h post-transfection (p.t.), BAG3 levels in BAG3siRNA-loaded cells were reduced by about 40% and more than 70%, respectively, compared to scramble RNA (scrRNA)-transfected cells. The slight increase of BAG3 protein in scrRNA-loaded cells with respect to control (untransfected) cells was possibly due to transfection procedureinduced stress. Notably, we found that, under our experimental conditions, BAG3 down-modulation caused a reduction of cell number specifically in HeLa cells (Fig. 1B) . Phase-contrast microscopy analysis of BAG3-silenced HeLa cell revealed the presence of cells loosing the flat/spindle-shaped morphology and an increase in the number of cells floating in the medium (Fig. 1C) . Figure 1D shows that BAG3 silencing reduced the adhesion efficiency to FNcoated plates more markedly in HeLa than in C33A cells, thus confirming that BAG3 contributes in promoting cell-matrix contacts specifically in HeLa.",

Under our experimental conditions, PEITC Ic50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) value at 24 h was about 12 \u03bcM in both the two cell lines (dose-response curves not shown). To gain more insight into the mechanisms underlying PEITC cell growth inhibition potential in HeLa and C33A cells, we titrated the effects of such drug on cell cycle progression and apoptotic death ( Fig. 2A) . In C33A cells, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were induced almost simultaneously, while in HeLa cells the block in G2/M seemed to precede the onset of apoptosis. The timecourse of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest induction by 20 \u03bcM PEITC (Fig. 2B) suggested that apoptotic death occurred subsequently to G2/M arrest. As the percentages of cells accumulated in G2/M increased, the percentage of subG0/G1 cells started to grow. The reduction of G2/M cell population at 24 h treatment with this high PEITC dose (panels A and B in Fig. 2) , concomitant to an increase of cells in S and G0/G1 (data not shown), was due to the apoptotic fate of arrested cells, rather than to a recovery of cell cycle progression.

To avoid the possibility of false positive results due to BAG3 silencing-induced reduction of HeLa cell number (see Fig. 1B ) we adopted the following experimental conditions: i) BAG3siRNA-and scrRNA-transfected HeLa and C33A cells received vehicle or PEITC as early as at 62 h p.t. and were incubated with the drug further for 10 h; ii) only for HeLa cells: the amount of PEITC added to BAG3siRNA-transfected cells was about 15% lower than that used for scrRNA-transfected cells. PEITC-induced apoptosis in the different samples was monitored by the Annexin V/PI test to better discriminate between apoptotic and necrotic death. Results summarized in Fig. 3A show that BAG3 down-modulation allowed overcoming the low/delayed basal HeLa cell response to PEITC-triggered pro-death signals, this resulting in a marked and earlier increase of cells undergoing apoptosis. Notably, the percentages of apoptotic cells (phosphatidyl serine exposing cells, A + /PIand AP + /PI + ) was increased by about sevenfold in HeLa cells, while by less than twofold in C33A cells (Fig. 3B ). BAG3 down-modulation did not, instead, affect the extent of The involvement of BAG3 in PEITC-induced response in HeLa cells was also signified by the bi-phasic effect of the drug on BAG3 levels (Fig. 4) . In agreement with the stress-inducible nature of BAG3, its expression resulted in an increase at PEITC doses lower than 15 \u03bcM. The appearance of the additional immunoreactive BAG3 band with a slightly higher molecular weight in the doublet has been already reported in response to others stress-inducing chemicals [12] . Notably, the increase of BAG3 expression was followed by a marked suppression of BAG3 signal at 20 \u03bcM PEITC. Such a reduction was not simply due to gross toxicity since in C33A the same highly cytotoxic dose of PEITC had low, if any, effect on BAG3 levels.",

The signal was specific for E6 because it was absent in C33A cells (Fig. 6A) . BAG3 down-modulation led to a slight, but highly reproducible, decrease of E6 immunoreactive signal compared to control (non transfected) and scrRNA-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 6B) .

However, the two carcinoma cell lines displayed a different susceptibility to PEITC cytostatic and cytotoxic effects. The comparison of PEITC dose-response curves indicated that the reduction of cell number in HeLa cells was due mainly to cell cycle arrest, while in C33A cells to both apoptosis and G2/M block. Moreover, the kinetics of G2/M arrest and apoptosis induction by a fixed PEITC dose showed that in HeLa cells the onset of apoptosis was delayed and occurred mainly in G2/M arrested cells. Notably, we found that BAG3 down-modulation sensitized HeLa cells to PEITCtriggered pro-apoptotic signals, this resulting in a marked and early increase of cells undergoing apoptosis.

The presence of mutate p53 gene or perturbation of its functions are, indeed, common features of several human cancers [33] . Cervical carcinoma C33A (HPV -) cells express mutate p53, while HeLa (HPV18 + ) cells express wild-type p53 [34] . However, the viral E6 oncoprotein strongly affects the p53 status in HPV-infected cells mainly by promoting p53 proteasome degradation [35] and inhibiting its transactivation [36] . The restoration of p53 in high risk HPV + cells has been shown to positively correlate with increased susceptibility to undergo apoptosis in response to chemical and physical agents [37, 38] . Regarding PEITC, literature data suggest that the involvement of p53 pathways in PEITC cell growth inhibition is cell type-specific [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . Here, we demonstrated that BAG3 suppression, in addition to enhancing the apoptotic response of HeLa cells to PEITC, caused a significant increase of p53. This result could be taken as evidence of a role of restored p53 pathways in PEITC-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. A possible relationship between BAG3 suppression and p53 recovery for the commitment of HeLa cells toward a death fate was also supported, even if not conclusively proven, by the observation that the treatment of HeLa cells with a highly cytotoxic PEITC concentration resulted in a decrease of BAG3 concomitant to an increase of p53.",

E6-mediated p53 proteasome degradation is the main, if not exclusive, post-transcriptional mechanism responsible of the low p53 levels in HPV-infected cells [35, 46] . It has been shown that E6 promotes p53 proteasome degradation not only by the well established ubiquitination-dependent pathway [4], but also by ubiquitination-independent pathways [47] . Moreover, E6 can inactivate p53 also by inhibiting post-translational modifications, i.e. phosphorylation [48] and acetylation [36] , required not only for p53 transactivation, but also for its stability [49, 50] . Appropriate experimental conditions allowed us to detect E6, expressed at very low levels in HeLa cells, and to demonstrate that the suppression of BAG3 caused the decrease of E6. This was in support of a BAG3 silencing-induced impairment of p53 degradation machinery as one of the mechanisms responsible for the elevation of the transcriptional factor in HeLa cells. The cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase, E6AP, which cooperates with E6 for p53 ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation [4] , was, instead, unaffected by BAG3 down-modulation. The intracellular levels of E6 are regulated by the balance between expression and proteasome degradation [51, 52] . We showed that BAG3 silencing affected E6 at protein level. On the basis of this result and by considering the well known association of BAG3 functions with the proteasome system [27, 28] , we could hypothesize that BAG3 suppression allows a more efficient proteasome degradation of viral E6 oncoprotein [51, 52] . However, BAG3 has not been recognized as one of E6 partners [8] . Thus, it might contribute to E6 stability by assisting/sustaining the binding of the viral oncoprotein to those partners, namely E6AP [53], 14-3-3\u03b6 [54] , and PDZ domaincontaining proteins [55] , shown to be relevant for its own stabilization. In the present study, due to the low basal levels of viral E6 oncoprotein and, consequently, of p53 tumor suppressor in HeLa cell model, we were unable to investigate in depth the possible mechanisms by which BAG3 silencing promoted p53 elevation and E6 reduction in these cells. Further studies in cells over-expressing E6 or p53 are needed to address these questions.",

The higher BAG3 expression in HPV18 + HeLa compared to HPV -C33A might, in turn, result from an E6-activated positive feedback loop to sustain infected cell survival. Moreover, the demonstrated ability of PEITC to promote per se p53 recovery, possibly by depleting BAG3, might provide a rationale for the previously shown PEITC-induced sensitization of HeLa cells to apoptosis induced by cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic method routinely used in cervical cancer treatment [26] . Since cisplatin has also been reported to prevent p53 degradation [56] , the combined treatment of cells with the two drugs could actually result in a fast and marked p53 restoration in HeLa cells and, consequently, apoptotic death.",
