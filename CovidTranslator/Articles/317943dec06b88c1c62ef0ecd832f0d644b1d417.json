The daily confirmed cases will likely show an increasing trend purely due to the increase in sample processing throughput. Since Jan. 1, 2020, the Chinese CDC has progressively adopted different versions of the case definition, simplified the procedural burden to confirm a case and subsequently increased the throughput of processing virus samples. One study used a hypothesized temporally increasing confirmation rate to estimate R 0 (Zhao et al., 2020) . However, the actual confirmation rate is unknown and the estimated R 0 is highly variable. Another source of uncertainty is the suspected low confirmation rate of this disease. It has been estimated that only 5.1% of infections in Wuhan are identified (Read et al., 2020) . With these concerns, Wu et al. (2020) and Nishiura, Jung, et al. (2020) used an alternative data source, i.e., the number of internationally exported cases between Dec. 31, 2019 and Jan. 28, 2020, to infer the disease dynamics.",

Between Jan 29 and Feb 2, 2020, there have been 2,666 foreign nationals evacuated out of Wuhan, and their health has been closely monitored after arrival at their destination, 12 of them have been tested positive for COVD-19 infection as of this writing (Feb 11, 2020) . There has been at least 9 days between the latest date of evacuation included in this study and the last day of confirmation to avoid any bias in the infection rate. It should be emphasized that these evacuation flights took place after the city of Wuhan was quarantined, and all the successfully evacuated individuals have passed at least two rounds of body temperature screenings at the airport. In this study, it is assumed that these evacuees provide a representative sample of the status of the general population in Wuhan at the time of extraction. A subset of the evacuees data has been analyzed in Nishiura, Kobayashi, et al. (2020) With updated real time domestic traffic data, this study aims to update the current status of the COVD-19 outbreak in the city of Wuhan with the alternative information from the evacuees between the end of January and the start of February. In addition, the currently used prediction model for this outbreak, i.e., SEIR, does not allow for potential transmission of infection from latent individuals. In this study, the author modifies the SEIR model to evaluate the empirical support for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions based on current evidence.",

A total of 58 confirmed cases from 14 countries/regions were used in this study. In this study, the author adopts the same case definition as in Wu et al.

In this study, the date of exportation is defined as the date the individual exits Wuhan (local time, 49 cases), and when the exit date is not available, the symptom onset date was used (4 cases), and when both the exit date and the onset date were not available, the confirmation date was used instead (4 cases). The export dates fall between Dec. 31, 2019 and Jan. 29, 2019. Of the 40 cases, on which both the date existing Wuhan and the symptom onset date were available, 57.5% (23 cases) were asymptomatic when leaving Wuhan, 25% (10 cases) developed symptoms before leaving Wuhan, and 17.5% (7 cases) developed symptoms on the same date when leaving Wuhan.",

Due to the elevated population outflow since Jan. 1, 2020, the number of cumulative infected individuals in Wuhan is approximately linear between day 31 and day 51, then appears to stabilize afterwards, and then increases exponentially after the date Wuhan was quarantined (Figure 9 ). The predicted pattern closely resembles the trend of the cumulative number of officially confirmed cases in Wuhan with a time lag of approximately 3 days (Figure 1) . Assuming a constant time lag of 3 days, the confirmation rate of this disease has been low, i.e., less than 10%, in January 2019 but has steadily increased ever since ( Figure 10 ). On Feb. 10, 2020, the overall case confirmation rate is estimated at 23.37% on average with a 95% credible interval of [18.72%, 29.26%]. The time lag between the onset of symptoms and official confirmation of the case probably have decreased with time due to people's increased awareness of this disease and also the reduced procedural burden to confirm a case with newer versions of the case definition from the Chinese CDC. To evaluate other time lags, the estimated case confirmation rate was calculated with lags between 1 and 5 days. These time lags produced similar results on the case confirmation rate on Feb. 10, 2020 (Table 2) .",

It is thus important to consider alternative information to update our understanding about the outbreak. This study integrates the recent infection data on the early dynamics of the COVD-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China with updated real time domestic traffic data. Little empirical evidence was found supporting the presence of asymptomatic transmission. However, it is still too early to rule out its presence conclusively due to the relatively low sample size and the validity of the assumptions used in this study. The updated basic reproductive number was found to be 2.12 on average, which is significantly smaller than previous estimates (Read et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) , probably because the new estimate factors in the social and non-pharmaceutical mitigation implemented in Wuhan through the evacuee dataset.",

As a major traffic hub in central China, Wuhan's capacity to drive significant population flows is driving the accelerated spread of the disease domestically. Real time traffic flow out of Wuhan was found to differ significantly from its historical patterns. From Jan. 1, 2020, when the Huanan seafood market was disinfected, to Jan. 23, 2020, when the city of Wuhan was quarantined, the net traffic flow has always been outwards. During this period, the overall net outflow is estimated to be over 9 million individuals. On Feb. 11, 2020, the disease has already spread to all provinces of China with 44,653 confirmed cases in China. In early January, the number of cases in Wuhan is only growing linearly ( Figure 9 ) and even appears to have stabilized days before Jan. 23, due to the accelerated outflow. It is thus very dangerous to overinterpret the temporal pattern of the number of cases without taking into account real time traffic.",

Due to the elevated domestic outflow, it is reasonable to expect a similar elevated outflow in the international traffic. The internationally exported cases inform the disease dynamics through the proportion of infected outbound international travelers from Wuhan. Increasing the outward flow effectively reduces the proportion infected and subsequently the basic reproductive number. Generally, international traffic by air is less variable than domestic traffic by road, and the potential surge in outbound international traffic would be less than 15% (the surge in outbound domestic traffic).",

Many of those trips would take multiple days. For example, a trip from Wuhan to Beijing would span days if the traveler chooses to travel by road. But the real time traffic data would erroneously indicate flow from Wuhan into some traffic hubs in between Wuhan and the final destination, because of the daily accounting unit used in the calculation of the flow pattern.

Baidu Migration offers a daily heat index for the intensity of the population flow both out of and into Wuhan. Here, it is assumed that the heat index is linear with the size of population flow. To estimate the scaling factor s between the absolute size of the traffic and the heat index h, the historical population flow out of Wuhan L w,c and into Wuhan L c,w in 2019 were used, o (d) and h i (d) are respectively the heat index for the traffic moving out of and into Wuhan on day d, Jan. 12, 2019 and Mar. 12, 2019 are the end dates when the Baidu Migration data are available in 2019, and they correspond to the period between Jan. 1, 2020 and Feb. 18, 2020 according to Lunar Calendar, L w,c =502,013, L c,w =487,310 before 2019 chunyun, and L w,c =717,226, L c,w =810,500 during 2019 chunyun (between Jan. 21 and Mar. 1, 2019) based on Wu et al. (2020). The scaling factor s was found to be 138,412.01 individuals per unit of the heat index. It is further assumed that the scaling factor is similar between 2019 and 2020. With the estimated scaling factor s, the number of people at time t moving out of Wuhan L w,c (t) and into Wuhan L c,w (t) domestically was calculated based on real time Baidu Migration heat index h i (t) at time t between Jan. are respectively the heat index for traffic moving out of and into Wuhan at time t in 2020.

The joint posterior distribution obtained the highest density in the upper right corner of their range where \u03b3 is close to 1 and R 0 is around 2.05. When 1 \u03b3 = , the SEAIR model is equivalent to the SEIR model. This result further supports the better performance of the SEIR model for the current infection data, and the lack of evidence for the presence of an asymptomatic infectious stage. To avoid the potential danger of omitting asymptomatic transmissions, ensemble model predictions were calculated based on the weighted predictions from both SEIR and SEAIR models. The number of exported infected individuals internationally is approximately linear since day 31 (Jan. 1, 2020) until Wuhan was quarantined (Figure 7). The total number of cases exported internationally is estimated at 146 individuals on average with a 95% credible interval of [121, 173] individuals. The number of infected individuals exported domestically shows an exponentially increasing pattern until Wuhan was quarantined (Figure 8). At its peak, an average of 3,354 infected individuals with a 95% credible interval of [2696, 3996] individuals were exported daily into other cities of China.
