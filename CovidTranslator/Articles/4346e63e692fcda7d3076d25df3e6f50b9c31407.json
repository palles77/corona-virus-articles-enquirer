A newer strain is made to emerge in the population when a preexisting strain has reached equilbrium. We assume that this newer strain does not exhibit cross-immunity with the original strain, hence those who are vaccinated and recovered from the original strain become susceptible to the newer strain. Recent events involving the COVID-19 virus demonstrates that it is possible for a viral strain to emerge from a population at a time when the influenza virus, a well-known virus with a vaccine readily available for some of its strains, is active in a population. We solved for four different equilibrium points and investigated the conditions for existence and local stability. The reproduction number was also determined for the epidemiological model and found to be consistent with the local stability condition for the disease-free equilibrium. 4 susceptibility to diseases amongst others [1-3]. The drop in numbers in vaccination has 5 led to outbreaks of diseases such as mumps [4-6] that could have been prevented by 6",

Individuals who do not advocate vaccination commonly cite reasons 3 such as fear of adverse side-effects, perceived low efficacy of vaccines, and perceived low influenza-like illness in Israel accounting for weather and antigenic drift by adding terms 48 that account for weather signals and lost of immunity. Finkenstadt et al. [31] created a 49 predictive stochastic SIRS model for weekly flu incidence accounting for antigenic drift. 50 Roche et al. [32] used an agent-based SIR model to describe the spread of a multi-strain 51 epidemic, while Shi et al. [33] used the same approach and empirical data from Georgia, 52 USA to model an influenza pandemic that incorporates viral mutation and seasonality. 53 However, these approaches have been stochastic in nature, which does not provide 54 information regarding the stability and existence of equilibrium points in an infected 55 population. The abovementioned articles also do not take vaccination and the presence 56 of other strains into account in their models. Consequently, one can model the presence 57 of a mutated virus spreading into a population using a multi-strain model, which was 58 used in the following studies for avian flu [23, 24] . These models study the birds and the 59 humans as one population in an SI-SIR model, where the first SI corresponds to the 60 compartments for the avian species. However, the two infected compartments in this 61 model do not cross since they are separated by species. Casagrandi et al. [25] 62 introduced a non-linear deterministic SIRC epidemic model to model the influenza A 63 virus undergoing an antigenic drift. The SIRC model is a modified SIR model with an 64 additional compartment, C, for individuals that receive partial immunity from being which did not investigate the equilibrium model in detail.",

            "text": "In the case of the influenza virus, it is possible to have multiple strains exist in a 72 population, but only have vaccine for a certain strain that will not be effective for 73 others. The fact that viruses undergo changes regularly indicates that people who have 74 recovered from the virus, as well as individuals who have been vaccinated for a specific 75 strain of the virus, can be susceptible again to a newly-emerged strain. It is important 76 to determine the conditions in which a newly emerged strain and a common strain that 77 has a means of immunity will coexist in a population. 78 Another apt example for emerging diseases is the emergence of the COVID- 19 virus 79 in 2019 [39, 40] . As of March 17, 2020, there have been 167,545 confirmed cases of 80 COVID-19 in 150 different countries that has led to 6,606 deaths since it was declared 81 as an outbreak in January 2020 according to the WHO situation report [41] . At the 82 time that this paper is being written, there are papers that have modeled the dynamics 83 of the virus using different modifications of the SIR model. Zhou et. al. [42] included 84 compartments corresponding to suspected cases, which consists of the individuals that 85 show similar symptoms but are not confirmed cases, and indirectly infected individuals. 86 Pan et. al. [43] used a modified SEIR model which included asymptomatic and given that one of these strains has a vaccine available. This paper introduces a model 97 that approaches the lack of cross-immunity across different viral strains by introducing 98 new compartments to the SIR with vaccination model. This enables us to introduce 99 acquired immunity through vaccination and cross-immunity between strains in a simple 100 compartmental model and investigate the existence and stability of the resulting 101 equilibrium points. We aim to model the dynamics of an epidemic where a new emergent strain of an 103 existing virus affects a closed population. The existing virus will be modeled using a 104 modified SIR model with vaccination, however we assume that the vaccine does not 105 provide immunity to the newer strain. The equilibrium points were determined for the 106 system based on the transition equations and local stability was investigated for each 107 point. Once the stability conditions have been established, the epidemic model was 108 simulated using R [46] to check the steady-state behavior of the surveillance data for next two subsections will explain the dynamics before and after the emergence of the 124 mutated strain.",

After establishing the possible transitions between compartments, the 459 system was found to have four equilibrium points: the disease free equilibrium, the 460 existing strain equilibrium, the emergent strain equilibrium, and the endemic 461 equilibrium. Upon examining the conditions for existence and local stability, the 462 disease-free equilibrium was determined to be locally stable when both R v and R 0 are 463 less than one. This is consistent with the reproduction number for this multi-strain 464 model. The existing strain equilibrium surprisingly did not impose that R 0 < 1, which 465 is the condition for the DFE of a normal SIR model for a single-strain without 466 immunity. This implies that if the original strain is much more contagious than the 467 emergent strain, the emergent strain would still die out eventually regardless of the fact 468 that it would persist in the population if it was on its own. On a similar note, the local 469 stability condition for the emergent equilibrium condition also does not impose that 470 R v < 1. This means that the state of the system prior to the emergence of the new 471 strain does not matter as long as the emergent strain is more contagious than the 472 existing strain. This leaves a highly restrictive condition for endemic equilibrium to 473 exist: the emergent strain must be able to survive by itself and the original strain must 474 be contagious enough to infect enough people, which is given by Eq 44. Eq 44 also 475 implies that the two-strain endemic equilibrium will only be locally asymptotically .
