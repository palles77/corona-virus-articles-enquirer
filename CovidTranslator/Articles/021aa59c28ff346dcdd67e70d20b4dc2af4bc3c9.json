            "text": "This paper aims to give deeper insights into decision making problem based on interval-valued fuzzy soft set (IVFSS). Firstly, a new score function for interval-valued fuzzy number is proposed for tackling the comparison problem. Subsequently, the formulae of information measures (distance measure, similarity measure and entropy) are introduced and their transformation relations are pioneered. Then, the objective weights of various parameters are determined via new entropy method, meanwhile, we develop the combined weights, which can show both the subjective information and the objective information. Moreover, we propose three algorithms to solve interval-valued fuzzy soft decision making problem by Weighted Distance Based Approximation (WDBA), COmbinative Distance-based ASsessment (CODAS) and similarity measure. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of approaches are demonstrated by a mine emergency decision making problem. The salient features of the proposed methods, compared to the existing interval-valued fuzzy soft decision making methods, are (1) it can obtain the optimal alternative without counterintuitive phenomena; (2) it has a great power in distinguishing the optimal alternative; and (3) it can avoid the parameter selection problems.",

            "text": "During the process of economic and social globalization in the 21st century, the world is undergoing an unheard-of period of crisis so far. A substantial emergency events arose, such as September 11 attacks in 2001, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, Tianjin explosion accident in 2015, Jiuzhai Valley earthquake in 2017, and so on, which demolished the country or the society involving massive humans, material resources, economic, or local environment. The influences of the emergency incidents ordinarily beyond the ability of the affected country or society to dispose of its own resources. As a consequence, the topic about emergency response has touched off the heated discussions in recent times (Ren, Xu, & Hao, 2017) . Emergency decision making, one of the significant domains in the emergency response, is urgent to be explored by building the decision making techniques to polish up the efficiency and productiveness of the emergency response, which can enormously reduce the casualties, environment disruption and the economic losses. Every barber knows that one of the momentous characters of the emergency response is timeliness, which implies that the rescue forces are required for taking impactful actions in the short time. Meanwhile, for the timestarved in the emergency response, there exists much uncertain and unknown information. Under such circumstance, the experts make decisions with a great power in distinguishing the optimal alternative rather than in low differentiated alternatives. Furthermore, the indeterminacies of the emergency circumstance determine that the experts can't offer the precise decision making information when they confront diverse choices. While a wide diverse of the existing theories such as theory of fuzzy set (Zadeh, 1965) , theory of probability, and theory of rough set (Pawlak, 1982) have been initiated to simulate vagueness. Each of these theories has its inherent insufficiencies as pointed out in (Molodtsov, 1999) nevertheless. The theory of soft set (SS), poineered by Molodtsov (Molodtsov, 1999) , has come fresh from the deficiency of the parameterization tools of those groundbreaking theories (Pawlak, 1982; Zadeh, 1965) . It has potential applications in diverse fields such as rule mining (Feng, Cho, Pedrycz, Fujita, & Herawan, 2016) , game theory (Deli & \u00c7a\u011fman, 2016) , feature selection (Yang, Xiao, Xu, Wang, & Pan, 2016) , decision making (Akta\u015f & \u00c7a\u011fman, 2016) , parameter reduction (Xie, 2016) .",

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to tackle the three challenges mentioned above by developing three MCDM approaches to managing evaluation information for IVFSSs, which not only have a great power in distinguishing the optimal alternative, but also can obtain an optimal alternative out of counterintuitive phenomena and parameter selection problems.

The CODAS utilizes the Euclidean distance as the primary measure of assessment. If the Euclidean distance of two alternatives is very close to each other, the Hamming distance is utilized to compare them. The degree of closeness of Euclidean distance is set by a threshold parameter. The Euclidean distance and Hamming distance are measured for l 2 -norm and l 1 -norm indifference spaces, respectively (Yoon, 1987) . Therefore, in the CODAS method, we first assess the alternatives in an l 2 -norm indifference space. If the alternatives are not comparable in this space, we go to an l 1 -norm indifference space. To perform this process, we should compare each pair of alternatives. CODAS approach has already been applied in market segment evaluation (Ghorabaee, Amiri, Zavadskas, Hooshmand, & Antuchevic\u020ben\u0117, 2017) . (3) In order to compute the information measure (distance measure, similarity measure and entropy) of two interval-valued fuzzy soft sets, we propose a new method for constructing of distance measure and similarity measure.

The subjective weighting methods concentrate on the preference information of the experts (Feng et al., 2010) , while they overlook the objective information. The objective weighting determine methods do not take the preference of the decision maker into consideration, in other words, these methods fail to take the risk attitude of the decision maker into account (Xiao et al., 2013) . The feature of our weighting model can show both the subjective information and the objective information.
