            "text": "We valuated specific cellular and humoral immune response of cases of enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection and correlated immune response with clinical outcome. After obtaining informed consent, we enrolled 30 EV71 cases including 7 cases with brainstem encephalitis plus pulmonary edema, 12 cases of CNS (CNS) involvement and 11 uncomplicated cases. We measured antibodies specific to EV71, lymphocyte proliferation response and EV71-stimulated cellular response of Th1/Th2 cytokines and chemokines. The 7 EV71 cases involving brainstem encephalitis plus pulmonary edema had a significantly lower phytohemagglutinin stimulation index than other cases (p \u03ed 0.04). After EV71 stimulation of peripheral mononuclear cells, there was a significant increase in cellular Th1 cytokine (\u2425interferon) and proinflammatroy cytokines. However, cases with pulmonary edema had significantly lower cellular \u2425-interferon (p \u03ed 0.04), lower cellular IL-1\u2424 (p \u03ed 0.04), lower cellular IL-6 (p \u03ed 0.04), lower cellular tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 response (p \u03ed 0.04), and lower cellular macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u2423 (p \u03ed 0.04) response compared with other cases. Their titers of EV71 neutralizing antibodies demonstrated no difference among cases. These results suggest lower EV71-specific cellular response may be associated with immunopathogenesis of EV71-related pulmonary edema.

It remains unknown why different hosts of the same EV71 infection have such a range of clinical outcomes (17, 18) . Perhaps this range is related to virulence or load of the virus, or particular host factors. To date no relationship has been found between EV71 genotypes and clinical outcome (19, 20) , and EV71 virulence factors have not been clarified.

EV71 IgM was measured at the onset of disease and EV71 neutralization antibody was evaluated at the same time with the measurement of cellular immunity. The laboratory method for measuring EV71 neutralizing antibody followed the standard protocol of neutralization test in microtiter plates (21) . Serum samples were inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min and then serially diluted from 2-to 1,024-fold. We mixed and incubated (37\u00b0C, 2 h) 50 L of each diluted serum with 50 L containing one hundred 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) of EV71 strain TW/2272/98 (GenBank accession number AF119795) in microtiter plates (19) Two replicate wells were used per serum dilution. Then microtiter plates were seeded with 100 L of rhabdomyosarcoma cells (8 \u03eb 10 4 cells per mL) and incubated (37\u00b0C 5% CO 2 atmosphere, 2-7 d). Each test was run with cell control, serum control and virus back titration with 100 -0.1 TCID 50 . Cytopathic effect was observed under an inverted microscope after incubation, and serotiter was determined when Cytopathic effect was observed in 1 TCID 50 of the virus back titration. Microtiter plates were fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Seropositivity was defined as serotiter \u0546 8. For EV71 IgM detection, EV71 isolate TW/2086/98 was amplified and purified as an antigen for use in -capture ELISA, whose sensitivity and specificity was 91.5% and 93.1%, respectively (22) . Cellular immunity: Proliferation response, cellular Th1/Th2 cytokine and chemokine response. To isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), blood samples were heparinized and subjected to Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia Diagnostics AB, Uppsala, Sweden) gradient centrifugation. Cells at the interface were removed carefully and washed twice with PBS. The isolated PBMCs were cultured in 96-well round-bottom microplates (3 \u03eb 10 5 cells per well in 0.2 mL of culture medium) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 M 2-ME, 100U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 2% human AB serum (Biocell Laboratories Inc., Rancho Domingnez, CA).",

Higher incidence of most severe EV71 diseases were found in children under 3 y of age (15, 16) , and this might be explained by their weaker cellular immunity. We hypothesize that lower cellular immunity may delay viral killing or clearance, thus resulting in viral dissemination, sustained systemic inflammatory response and subsequent pulmonary edema. Host genetic factors may also play an important role and will require further investigation. Yang KD et al. reported that patients with EV 71 meningoencephalitis had a higher frequency of G/G genotype with a polymorphism of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 at position 49 of exon 1 than did control subjects without meningoencephalitis. In these cases there was no difference in specific EV 71 neutralizing antibody titers in the 2 groups (23). In our study, humoral immunity did not affect the clinical outcome of EV71 infection, either. Results from the two studies suggest that younger children with genetics involving decreased cellular rather than humoral response may be linked to severe EV 71 infection.",

However, we had a seroepidemiology study, done in 1999 (18) , which showed that 94% (177/189) of 3-to 6-month-old children and 92% (265/287) of 7-to 12month-old children did not have EV71 neutralizing antibody.

            "text": "Our previous studies reported that patients with pulmonary edema had dramatically high blood values of IL-1\u2424, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u2423, white blood cell counts, and glucose levels (24, 25) . These findings suggest that a combination of CNS and systemic inflammatory response may trigger EV71related cardiopulmonary collapse (24) . Another study of patients with pulmonary edema showed significant immunomodulator elevation as well as lower circulating CD4 \u03e9 T-cells, CD8 \u03e9 T-cells, and natural killer cells (26) . They also suggested that the combination of an extensive systemic and CNS inflammatory response and lymphocyte depletion appears to be responsible for the pathogenesis of EV71associated pulmonary edema (26) .",

            "text": "Suggested treatments have varied. Since those cases with pulmonary edema had lower cellular immunity, a rational treatment may involve regimens to enhance cellular immunity. In the case of poliomyelitis, IFN-\u2425 treatment of age-dependent poliomyelitis-susceptible mice protected them from paralytic disease (27) . Recent studies have also shown that interferon-\u2425 synergizes with IFN-\u2423/\u2424 to inhibit the replication of both RNA and DNA viruses. Scagnolari et al. investigated the effects of IFNs on the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), finding that although SARS-CoV is only moderately sensitive to IFN-\u2424 and weakly sensitive to IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425, in combination they have a strong synergistic effect on virus replication (28) . These two studies imply treatments for severe EV71 infection, but further animal or clinical trial is mandatory to prove the efficacy of immunomodulators. In addition, use of an antiviral agent to decrease replication may also be beneficial (29) . Animal studies are ongoing on this topic. In the Liu et al. study, an early administration of recombinant mouse interferon-\u2423 protected the mice against EV71 infection and in vitro analysis of virus-induced death showed that human type I interferons exerted a direct protective effect on EV71, so interferons may play an important role in controlling EV71 infection and replication (30) .",
