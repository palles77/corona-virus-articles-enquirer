The relationship between neonatal morbidity or mortality and failure of passive transfer of Ig has been demonstrated in numerous epidemiological studies (2, 3, 13, 15) . One of the most important ways to reduce calf morbidity and mortality is the early administration of adequate amounts of Ig in colostrum. Calves may not receive adequate amounts of Ig if the dam's colostrum is not of sufficient quality or quantity or if fresh or frozen colostrum from another cow is not available. The purpose of this study was to test the value of a commercial dried colostrum powder, DCW Concentrate\u2122 (DC; Smarte International, Inc., Calgary, AB, Canada) as a colostrum supplement or substitute.",

Each of these viability signs was scored from 0 to 2, and the sum of single Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 76. No. 3. 1993 scores for each parameter was a measure of the degree of viability. According to this scheme, \"viable\" calves had scores of 7 to 8 points (minimum criterion for selection for the study). Calves \"at risk\" had scores of 4 to 6 points. \"Weak\" newborns were scored 0 to 3 points. Thirty and 60 min after birth, calves were examined; special consideration was given to abnormalities of the respiratory system to exclude calves that developed respiratory distress syndrome during the 1st h after delivery. For the remainder of the study, the clinical status of the calves was monitored continuously by general and, if necessary, by special examination at least twice daily.",

We assumed that, at 2 h after birth, not all calves would voluntarily drink the relatively large volume of fluid stipulated in the protocol. Therefore, all calves were fed with an esophageal tube. A uniform procedure was used because method of feeding (voluntary intake vs. forced feeding with a stomach tube) influences the absorption of Ig (21) .",

The group A calves had a mean IgG concentration of 254.5 mg/IOO ml. This low concentration may be because the 85-g dose of DC specified on the label contained only 9.6 g of IgG. By contrast, the dose of 3 kg of the pooled colostrum used in this trial contained 288 g of IgG.",

Nevertheless, group A had low morbidity and mortality rates for calves raised under intensive conditions. We can only speculate why calves in group A did not have more severe diseases, particularly the severe systemic infections that are typical of hypogammaglobulinemic calves. Because weak and asphyctic calves were excluded from the study, some disease risk was removed. Despite low IgG serum concentrations, the administration of 85 g of DC may have led to an effective local protection in the intestine through unabsorbed Ig or Ig fragments. An important role in the protection of the calf from enteric disease has been attributed to Ig that are not absorbed and that act locally in the intestine (10, 11, 14) .",

The administration of 85 g of DC in 3 kg of colostrum (group C) tended to raise the IgG concentration above that in the group fed 3 kg of colostrum alone (group B), although the difference was not significant. The use of an esophageal tube to administer IgG may explain why relatively large doses of Ig given to calves in groups Band C did not lead to IgG blood concentrations as high as those reported in the literature (7, 19, 21) . Administration of colostrum with the tube leads to lower serum concentrations of Ig than does voluntary suckling by calves (21) . Radiological surveys (21) have shown that, after tube administration, colostrum entered the rumen first. Therefore, Ig in colostrum reach the small intestine much later and are absorbed there to a lesser extent because of the rapidly declining ability of the intestine to absorb Ig.",

When no fresh or frozen colostrum is available from the dam or other donor cows, the administration of 85 g of DC can be beneficial. Because of the very low Ig concentrations attained in serum after administration of this product, its use should be restricted to emergencies in which colostrum is not available. Use of a higher dose in order to attain higher serum Ig concentrations may not be economically justifiable, depending on cost of the product. Feeding of a mixture of DC and colostrum can be considered when the available colostrum is of low quality or when insufficient quantities are available; the DC probably is more useful as an extender of natural colostrum than as a colostrum substitute.",
