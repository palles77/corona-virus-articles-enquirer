            "text": "Herpesvirus infection was investigated in black bears (Ursus americanus) with neurological signs and brain lesions of nonsuppurative encephalitis of unknown cause. Visible cytopathic effects (CPE) could only be observed on days 3-5 post-infection in HrT-18G cell line inoculated with bear tissue extracts. The observed CPE in HrT-18G cells included syncytia, intranuclear inclusions, and cell detachments seen in herpesvirus infection in vitro. Herpesvirus-like particles were observed in viral culture supernatant under the electron microscope, however, capsids ranging from 60 nm to 100 nm in size were often observed in viral cultures within the first two passages of propagation. Herpesvirus infection in the bear tissues and tissue cultures were detected by PCR using degenerate primers specific to the DNA polymerase gene (DPOL) and glycoprotein B gene (gB). DNA sequencing of the amplicon revealed that the detected herpesvirus has 94-95% identity to Ursid gammaherpesvirus 1 (UrHV-1) DNA sequences of DPOL. Phylogenetic analysis of DPOL sequences indicates that black bear herpesviruses and UrHV-1 are closely related and have small distances to members of Rhadinovirus. Interestingly, black bear herpesvirus infections were also found in bears without neurological signs. The DPOL DNA sequence of black bear herpesviruses detected in neurological bears were similar to the those detected in the non-neurological bears. However, the gB DNA sequence detected from the neurological bear is different from non-neurological bear and has only 64.5%-70% identity to each other. It is possible that at least two different types of gammaherpesviruses are present in the U. americanus population or several gammaherpesviruses exist in ursine species. phoma, primary effusion lymphoma in human (Moore et al., 1996; Wong and Damania, 2005) .

            "text": "Gammaherpesviruses are common infections in a wide variety of mammalian species. The subfamily of Gammaherpesvirinae includes four characterized genera: Lymphocryptovirus, Macavirus, Pervavirus, Rhadinovirus and unassigned genus. Lymphocryptoviruses are often associated with lymphoproliferative diseases, and have been identified in at least 9 different species, such as human, macacine, cercopithecine, leporid and ovine. Human herpesvirus 4 (HHV4) is one of the prominent lymphocryptoviruses associated with a number of human cancers (Grywalska et al., 2013; Petersson, 2015) . HHV4, also known as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), prevalent in 90 to 95% of the human population, is also clinically associated with various neurological diseases such as primary central nervous system lymphoma, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, cerebellar ataxia, and encephalitis (Ali and Lawthom, 2013; Corssmit et al., 1997; Davies et al., 2016; Fallo et al., 2005) . Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), also known as Kaposi's sarcomaassociated herpesvirus (KSHV), and Murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) are most studied rhadinoviruses. HHV8 or KHSV is mainly linked to the development of Kaposi's sarcoma and a rare B cell lym-neurotropic and can infect neuronal cell lines, Sh-Sy5y and Ntera2 cells, as well as human primary neurons (Cho and Song, 2014) . MHV-68, also called murid gammaherpesvirus 4, was originally isolated from a bank vole by passage through mouse brain (Terry et al., 2000) . MHV-68 is known to persist in the brain after cerebral infection and can causes cerebral infection with inflammation in 50% of the infected animals (Hausler et al., 2005) . Rhesus macaque rhadinovirus, another member of the Rhadinovirus genus, has been shown to cause encephalomyelitis and diseases similar to multiple sclerosis in human (Axthelm et al., 2011) . Members of Percavirus, such as equine gammaherpesvirus 2 and mustelid gammaherpesvirus 1, are not linked to a specific disease, except equine gammaherpesvirus 5 (EHV-5), which is linked to equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis (Williams et al., 2007) . Members of the Macavirus can be either non-pathogenic, such as BHV-6, or pathogenic, such as malignant catarrhal fever virus (MCFV) and caprine herpesvirus 2 (CHV-2). BHV-6 is ubiquitous in healthy cattle populations (Koptopoulos et al., 1988) , but MCFV and CHV-2 can cause fatal multisystemic disease in sheep and buffalo (Brenner et al., 2002; Li et al., 2005 Li et al., , 1999 Loken et al., 2009) .",

To determine whether the observed viral particles are herpesviruses, tissues collected from the two NV black bears B1 and B2 were examined by nested PCR using panherpesvirus primers (Pozo et al., 2016 ) and herpesvirus consensus primers (VanDevanter et al., 1996) . To determine if herpesviral genome is present in NV bear B1 and B2, total DNA from brain, kidney, liver and lymph nodes was analyzed by the nested panherpesvirus PCR. As shown in Fig. 3 , amplicons within the predicted size were detected in all tissue DNA samples from both NV bears B1 and B2, when 360 GC Enhancer was included in the PCR reactions. DMSO is also an enhancer for GC rich samples and when DMSO was included in PCR reaction, only correct amplicons were detected in total DNA of all B1 tissues, but only one of B2 tissues. Therefore, 360 GC Enhancer was used in the rest of the panherpesvirus PCR tests. In addition, correct PCR products were also obtained when herpesvirus consensus primers were used (data not shown here). To determine if the herpesviral genome is present in black bears without clinical neurological signs, another four bears (NV17a, NV17b, NV17c and NV14a) from Nevada and one bear (Z3) from California were tested by nested panherpesvirus PCR primers, which were more sensitive than the herpesvirus consensus primers (unpublished data).

It suggests the herpesviral DNA detected from NV bear and CA bear are very similar. DNA sequencing of the PCR product amplified by the herpesvirus consensus primer of VanDevanter et al. (VanDevanter et al., 1996) also confirmed the detection of herpesviruses sequences from bears B1 and B2.

The sequences of amplicons by the herpesvirus consensus primers are more close to Phocid herpesvirus 2 (PHV-2) and harp seal herpesvirus isolate (HsHV), which have not been assigned genus (data not shown here). Both PHV-2 and HsHV branched together with member of Macavirus, such as BHV-6, which used to be member of Rhadinavirus in older classifications.

Here, using the GS gB primers, gB like DNA sequence were amplified from DNA samples from both neurological bear B1 and non-neurological bears.

A nonsuppurative encephalitis was identified in these animals via histopathology, but at this time, the causative agent remains unclear. However, during this investigation, herpesviruses were considered a potential cause, as ursine encephalitis cases have been linked to alphaherpesviruses (Dombrowski et al., 2016) . Investigations using degenerate PCR primers, both at the OVDL and at Michigan State University VDL, resulted in amplification of DPOL DNA sequences with homology to gammaherpesviruses in a variety of tissues and in bears with and without evidence of neurologic disease. However, investigations using genus-specific glycoprotein B gene (gB) primers revealed that the gB DNA sequence obtained from neurological bear B1 is different from those amplified from bears without neurologic disease. It is possible that a specific type of gammaherpesvirus is associated with bear neurologic disease. However, if several gammaherpesviruses with similar DPOL DNA sequences exist in black bears, it will require further study to connect a specific herpesvirus with neurological diseases in bears.",

Vero, CRFK, RK-15, and MDBK are all susceptible to alphaherpesvirus infections, such as bovine herpesvirus type 1, equine herpesvirus type 1, pseudorabies virus, feline herpesvirus type 1, and canine herpesvirus type 1. Infections of those alphaherpesviruses produce CPE, such as syncytia, intranuclear inclusions, and cell detachments. No CPE was observed in those cells following inoculation of the bear tissue preparation within the 2 week observation period. HrT-18G cells are normally used for animal coronavirus isolations in the veterinary diagnostic lab. The fecal sample from Z3 was suspected for coronavirus and was inoculated to HrT-18G cells. Interestingly, cell fusion and cell detachment were observed at 3-5 day post-infection, which was different from the CPE seen in coronavirus infections. CPEs from coronavirus infections are characterized with cell death and cell detachment. It is interesting that human rectal epithelial cells are susceptible to this bear herpesvirus infection. Under EM examination, herpesvirus-like capsids and particles were observed in infected HrT-18 cells. However, the observation of complete herpesvirus virions is rare in infected HrT-18G cells. In addition, capsids of variable size were also observed in tissue culture infected with bear fecal samples, and many of them have morphology similar to rotavirus and coronavirus ( Fig. 2C and D) . Since HrT-18G cells are susceptible to coronavirus infection, it is not surprising to see coronavirus in cultures infected with fecal samples. It is possible coronaviruses are common in black bears. Another interesting finding in this study is that the production of UrHV-1like virus in vitro is low. The viral genome can only be detected in direct cell lysates by nested UrHV-1 specific PCR. Again, it is possible that the black bear herpesvirus replicates poorly in vitro. This correlates with the few CPE plaques observed in infected Hrt-18G cells. Fig. 7 .

There were two sets of nested degenerate PCR primers selected to detect the conserved herpesvirus genes, DNA polymerase and terminase in the bat herpesvirus study. The selection of those primers was based on HHV-5 reference genome (Accession No. NC_006273). Here, we find we can use panDPOL primer sets, which target the HHV-5 DNA polymerase, genome position between 79774 and 78991, 79750-79201, respectively. The anticipated PCR product with POLdeg1F/POLdeg1R and POLdeg2F/POLdeg2R are 713-992 bp and 482-758 bp, respectively. The conditions reported by Pozo F. et al can amplify the DNA polymerase sequence of alphaherpesviruses, such as HHV-1 and LHV-4, but not alloherpesviruses, such koi herpesvirus (KHV). However, inclusion of 360 enhancer in the PCR was able to amplify DNA polymerase coding sequence of KHV DNA. Another interesting observation in this study is that positive amplification occurred in all the tested tissues from bears B1 and B2 with neurological signs, however, fewer tissues tested positive in bears NV17a-c without clinical signs, and some instances, no tissue tested positive in bears without clinical signs. The lymphoplasmacytic nature of the encephalitis may account for the positive result in brain tissues from neurologic bears. The tissues which tested positive in non-neurological bears were often spleen and lymph nodes (Fig. 4) . It is possible that this black bear herpesvirus persists in these lymphoid rich tissues, like many other gammaherpesviruses and this hypothesis was pursued using whole blood EDTA samples collected from three other bears that had no neurologic signs. Positive amplification with UrHV-1 specific primers was observed in total DNA of white blood cells (WBC) from two black bears from Nevada and one from Oregon. DNA sequence of the amplicon from the WBC total DNA is similar to sequences amplified from bear spleen samples from CA Z3 and NV17a and lymph node sample of B1 (Fig. 10) . These findings are in agreement with the common feature of B cell latency of gammaherpesviruses.",

The old classification of Gammaherpesvirinae consists of 2 genera, Lymphocryptovirus and Rhadinovirus, the later includes the Macavirus and Percavirus. The new classification separates the Macavirus and Percavirus from Rhadinovirus, which consists of viruses appearing to be paraphyletic. It is possible that this black bear herpesvirus is paraphyletic under certain conditions. It is unknown if UrHV-1 is oncogenic. We speculate that the virus may merely have been present in lymphocytes associated with the carcinomas. The phylogenetic analysis shown in Fig. 6 , suggests that this black bear virus and UrHV-1 are close to members of Rhadinovirus and Macavirus. However, when genus-specific glycoprotein B (gB) gene primers (Ehlers et al., 2008) were used, gB DNA sequences from neurological bear had lower identity to gB DNA sequence amplified from non-neurological bear. Since they have less than 70% identity in gB gene, we propose that at least two different black bear herpesviruses exist in free-ranging black bears (Ursus americanus) and they may be close related to UrHV-1. More DNA sequences will be needed for further classification.",
