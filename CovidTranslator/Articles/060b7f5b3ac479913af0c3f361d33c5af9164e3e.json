In 1967, Mishell and Dutton developed an in vitro priming system in which mouse spleen cell suspensions could be stimulated to generate antibody responses in culture (Mishell and Dutton, 1967) . It was quickly observed that lymphocytes alone were not sufficient to induce antibody forming cell responses, and that an adherent accessory cell, or antigen presenting cell (APC), was required. At the time, macrophages were thought to be the key accessory cell because they composed a major population of adherent cells and also because their role in innate immunity had been long appreciated (Unanue and Cerottini, 1970) . However, macrophages failed to show robust activity in induction of antibody responses in vitro, and they rapidly digested ingested antigen suggesting that they would be unable to present it to lymphocytes Cohn, 1969, 1967; Steinman and Cohn, 1972) .",

First, in an in vitro model system to study graft rejection, i.e., mixed leukocyte reaction, DCs were nearly two orders of magnitude more potent than unfractionated spleen cells, B cells or macrophages in stimulating allogeneic T cells (Steinman and Witmer, 1978; . This effect is attributed to abundant allogeneic MHC II on DC surface, which does not require priming. Second, in a coculture system with syngeneic responding T cells and hapten-modified thymocytes, DCs induced MHC-restricted cytotoxic T cells specific to the hapten; in contrast, macrophages and other purified populations of lymphoid cells were nearly inactive as accessory cells .

Loss of Tregs leads to activation of T cells, which induces DC division via Flt3L. Conversely, increasing the number of DCs by Flt3L injection leads to an increase in the number of Treg cells (Figure 3) . Alterations in this mechanism lead to immune imbalance and can alter the course of autoimmune disease in mice (reviewed in Liu and Nussenzweig, 2010) . Thus, the Flt3L-mediated homeostatic feedback loop between Treg and DCs has clinical implication for vaccine design, as well as the control of auto-immunity. Finally, this mechanism is entirely consistent with the proposed role of DCs in maintaining tolerance and regulating immunologic responses in vivo (Steinman and Nussenzweig, 2002) .",

Viruses that enter the cytoplasm of pDCs are detected after autophagy, a conserved cell-autonomous process involving lysosomal degradation of cellular organelles to deliver cytoplasmic RNA to TLR7-containing endosomal compartments. Upon binding of ligands, TLR7 and TLR9 recruit MyD88. This results in assembly of a signal-transducing complex that includes IRAK4, TRAF6, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and IRF7 leading to type I IFN production. In pDCs, constitutive expression of IRF7 enables a rapid production of type I IFN. Type I IFN produced from activated pDC not only directly inhibits viral replication, but also activates NK, B cells and cDCs (Blanco et al., 2001) . Activation of pDC and production of type I IFN is tightly regulated by feedback inhibition. Constitutive activation of pDC and overproduction of type I IFN are at the center of pathogenic inflammation in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus.",

Besides pDCs, other DC subsets express TLRs, recognize PAMP and become activated. Different function of cDC subsets may be partly attributed to differential expression of Toll like receptors (TLRs). For example, spleen CD8a\u00fe cDCs in mouse and BDCA3\u00fe DCs in humans express TLR3 but lack TLR5 and TLR7; when stimulated with virus with double strand virus or PolyI:C, a ligand for TLR3, they produce IFNa and IL-12. CD11b \u00fe cDCs express TLR5 and TLR7 but low amount of TLR3 (Edwards et al., 2003) . DC activation leads to the recruitment of NK cells into the draining lymph nodes; activated DC also produce IL-12, IL-15 and IL-2, which in turn activate NK cells to produce IFN-g. DCs activate NKT cells by presenting glycolipids on CD1d molecules to the invariant T cell receptor on NKT cells in vivo (reviewed in Munz et al., 2005) . Another recently defined type of innate cells that can be activated by DCs are innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), lymphocytes that lack recombined antigen-recognition receptors that are dependent on the transcription factor ID2 for their development. Interestingly, distinct DC subsets activate different subsets of ILC. CD8a\u00fe DCs control ILC1s, which are functionally similar to Briseno et al., 2014) .",

Fc receptors on DCs include both activating and inhibitory forms (Muta et al., 1994) . The inhibitory receptors help DCs to maintain an immature tolerogenic state. In addition, DCs express many different types of pattern recognition receptors including the SIGN (specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin) family, and multiple C-type lectins such as macrophage mannose receptor (MMR), DEC205, and DCIR2.

In contrast, DCs sequester and preserve the captured antigen for later presentation. Preservation of antigens is critical for immunogenicity and is attributed to two features of DC lysosomes. The first is the low lysomsomal protease activity. Macrophages contain high levels of lysosomal proteases, enabling rapid degradation of internalized proteins to single amino acids. In stark contrast, DCs express low amount of proteases, resulting in a limited capacity for lysosomal degradation (Delamarre et al., 2005) . This low level proteolytic capacity is crucial since the peptides loaded on MHC and recognized by T cells must consist of peptides between 8 and 17 amino acids. A second feature is that DC lysosomes are less acidic than those in professional phagocytes. DC lysosome is featured with an incomplete assembly of V-ATPase that results in proton 'leakage,' and an efficient recruitment of Nox2 in lysosome that results in consumption of protons. Altogether, these lead to alkalynization of the endocytic compartment (Trombetta et al., 2003) . Therefore, the lower levels of proteolytic activity, and decreased acidity in endocytic compartment lead to a decrease in the rate of antigen digestion and increased availability of partially processed peptides for loading on MHC. This unique feature of DCs may also help preserve the antigen during the migration of nonlymphoid tissue DCs from the site of antigen capture to the lymph nodes.",

DC-T cell interactions have now been studied in the living state with two-photon microscopy (Shakhar et al., 2005) . DCs present antigen peptides on MHC I and MHC II and scan the TCRs on T cells that circulate through entering the lymph nodes via a brief interaction. When a TCR finds the cognate MHC-peptide, the TCR-bearing antigen specific T cells arrest on antigen presenting DCs, and this stable interaction lasts for at least 18 h. Such DC-T cell interaction leads to tolerance in the steady state, unless an activation signal such as TLR ligation triggers DCs to initiate immunity. In conventional presentation pathway, exogenous antigens are presented on MHC II to CD4 \u00fe T cells, whereas endogenous antigens are presented on MHC I to CD8 \u00fe T cells. CD8 \u00fe T cells are critical for protective immunity against intracellular pathogens and malignant tumor cells. However, viruses that do not infect DCs and tumors are exogenous antigens to DCs. Importantly, DCs are efficient in presenting exogenous antigen on MHC I, an unconventional presentation path called 'cross-presentation'. After taking up the exogenous viral or tumor antigens, in the form of non-replicative virus or apoptotic cells, DCs present them on MHC I to prime CD8 T cells (Albert et al., 1998) . In the absence DCs, mice are unable to process several different antigens through the exogenous pathway, indicating that DCs are the major cell type for crosspresentation to CD8 \u00fe T cells in vivo. Multiple receptors including FcR, Lox-1, CD205 and DNGR1 have been shown to mediate antigen uptake for cross-presentation. Batf3dependent CD8a\u00fe DCs in mice and their functional equivalent BDCA3 \u00fe DCs in humans excel in cross-presenting exogenous antigens (Hildner et al., 2008; Poulin et al., 2010; Schreibelt et al., 2012) . Exogenous presentation or cross-presentation by CD8a\u00fe DCs has proved essential for protective immunity against viruses and tumors.",

This is made possible by the two functionally distinct and phenotypically different stages of DCs. In the steady state, DCs in most tissues are equipped to capture and present antigens to T cells, but the outcome of antigen presentation by steady state DCs is tolerance and not immunity. Steady state DCs express high levels of pattern recognition and activation receptors allowing them to sense changes in the environment, including pathogens and inflammatory cytokines. For example, PAMP and DAMP associated with microbes and viruses induce DC activation by engaging Toll-like receptors and cytoplasmic receptors that recognize pathogen patterns such as MDA-5, RIG-I and DDX41, and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). Activated NK, NKT, and T cells stimulate DCs through direct cellular contact by ligation of CD40 on DCs. Type I interferon, produced by pDCs or non-hematopoietic cells upon invasion of microbes and virus, also effectively activate DCs. These signals, largely through the NF-\u03baB pathway, induce extensive differentiation of DC to a mature state, a state characterized by redistribution of MHC class II from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane, increased levels of cell surface MHC and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD40, CD80, and CD86, as well as secretion of cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-18 and IL-12, and chemokines.

In the presence of mature DCs producing IL-12 or interferons (as might occur when DCs are ligated by CD40L or infected with viruses), CD4 \u00fe T cells differentiate along a Th1 pathway for interferon-\u03b3 production. The latter in turn activates the antimicrobial activity of macrophages and promotes killer T cell differentiation. In the presence of exogenous IL-4, however, DCs induce T cells to differentiate into Th2 cells, which secrete IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. These cytokines help B cells to make antibodies of the IgG1 and IgE isotypes, activate eosinophils, and stimulate fibrosis. A new and striking pathway that was first discovered with human monocyte-derived DCs involves the epithelial derived cytokine, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). This cytokine activates DCs to induce \"inflammatory Th2 cells\" which produce TNF\u03b1 (rather than IL-10) in addition to IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (Soumelis et al., 2002) . DCs that are activated with either CD40L or TSLP are similar in appearance, being rich in MHC II and CD86 stimulatory molecules.

DCs are able to employ environmental signals, vitamin A in the gut and vitamin D3 in the skin, to induce Treg and maintain tolerance to harmless foreign antigens.

DCs carry HIV from peripheral tissues into draining lymph nodes, where the virus is transmitted to CD4 T cells. Transmission to CD4 T cells is dependent on DC-SIGN, a C-type lectin pathogen-recognition receptor expressed on the surface of DCs that retains the attached virus in an infectious state. Interestingly, DC-SIGN also serves as receptor for several other viruses, including hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, dengue virus, and the SARS coronavirus. Dengue virus targets DCs directly through DC-SIGN but also enters DCs as a passenger in the form of immune complexes that are taken up by Fc receptors. When infection occurs through antibody enhancement mediated by Fc receptor, the infected DCs are involved in induction of the T cell cytokines that mediate the vascular leak syndrome associated with the infection, causing hemorrhagic fever.",
