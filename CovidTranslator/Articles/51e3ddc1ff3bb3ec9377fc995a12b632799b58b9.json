            "text": ". Intraepithelial lymphocytes IELs play critical roles in gut immunity. In mice, gd T cells are a large component of the IEL population. In the rat, gd IELs are reportedly much less common, but technical issues suggest that previous analyses should be interpreted cautiously. The study of IELs in rats has been impeded by isolation procedures that are lengthy and complex, leading to small cell yields. For this reason, it is possible that rat IELs analyzed in previous studies have not been representative of the entire IEL compartment. We report a new method for the isolation of rat IELs that is based on the selective removal of intestinal epithelial cells under conditions that leave the basement membrane undisturbed. The method is rapid and requires neither enzymatic digestion, nor surgical removal of Peyer's patches, nor vigorous mechanical manipulation of the intestine. The yield of rat IELs using this method is 5-to 10-fold greater than that reported for other methods. Morphological and phenotypic analyses demonstrated that the purified cell population is comprised of IELs and is not contaminated with lamina propria or Peyer's patch lymphocytes. Phenotypic analysis revealed five major subsets of IELs \u017d . y based on differential cell surface expression of CD4, CD8, and ab T cell receptor TcR . Among the abTcR cells was a population of gd T cells present at levels not previously detected. The isolation of IEL sub-populations using this methodology should facilitate studies of the function of these cells in gut immunity. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

This has been particularly true for analyses \u017d . of rat intraepithelial lymphocytes IELs , only 5-10 million of which have typically been isolated from one animal. Different laboratories have reported variable cell \u017d yields and IEL phenotypes Fangmann et al., 1991a; Takimoto et al., 1992; Torres-Nagel et al., 1992; Kuhnlein et al., 1994; Gorczynski et al., 1996; Kearsey and Stadnyk, 1996; Helgeland et al., 1997;  .

Kearsey and Stadnyk, 1996 . To address these issues, we have developed an efficient new technique for the rapid isolation of large numbers of highly purified rat IELs. The technique is based in part on the susceptibility of intestinal epithelial cells to hypoxic conditions that leave the basement membrane relatively undisturbed. The sloughed epithelium carries with it the IELs, effectively dissecting away the lamina propria and Peyer's patches. IELs prepared in this way are high in yield and purity. They contain five major subsets, including a population of gd T cells present at levels much higher than previously described. ",

The methodology is noteworthy for two additional reasons. The first is its technical simplicity.

It takes only 2-3 h, yet reproducibly generates large numbers of pure IELs.",

We believe this to be the case because our method overcomes two obstacles that have previously impeded recovery of pure IELs. First, it dissects away epithelial cells from the intestine without disrupting the basement membrane. This prevents contamination of IEL preparations with lamina propria and Peyer's patch lymphocytes. Second, it eliminates many purification steps that have previously been required. These include incubation in chelating agents, mincing, vigorous shaking, eversion of the \u017d . intestine, and panning Lefran\u00e7ois, 1994 . Each of those procedures can cause substantial non-specific cell losses, leading to low cell yields. Previously published isolation protocols yield 5-15 million \u017d IELsrrat Fangmann et al., 1991b; Teitelbaum et al., . 1995; Kearsey and Stadnyk, 1996 .

IELs isolated using this method include five major sub-populations, among them significant numbers of gdTcR q and NK cells. The rapidity, efficiency, and product purity that characterize the ( ) method should facilitate functional and developmental studies of IEL sub-populations in the rat. Detailed analysis of IEL sub-populations using this new method may facilitate analyses of the mechanisms of oral tolerance.",
