Seven hundred and fifty nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for 17 viral agents. In each assay, the sensitivity and specificity for each target were determined against a composite reference standard. Two hundred and eighty-eight out of 750 (38.4%) specimens were positive by DFA or viral isolation, while an additional 214 (28.5%) were positive by multiplex PCR, for a total positivity rate of 66.9%. Of 502 positive specimens, one virus was detected in 420 specimens (83.7%), two in 77 (15.3%), three in four (0.8%) and four in one case (0.2%). Compared with a composite reference standard, the inter-assay accuracy of the multiplex PCR assays varied, but all were superior to conventional diagnostic methods in detecting a broad range of respiratory viral agents in children. In addition, the sensitivity of two commercial assays, Resplex II Plus PRE and Seeplex Influenza A/B Subtyping, was determined relative to the Astra influenza Screen & Type assay for detection of influenza A viruses, including seasonal influenzas and pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A virus. Using 75 positive and 55 negative nasopharyngeal swabs for influenza A by the Astra assay, the sensitivity of Seeplex and Resplex was 95.9% and 91.8%, respectively, with a specificity of 100% for both.",

Some viral targets were lumped together as necessary to perform a sensitivity and specificity analysis (i.e. entero/rhinovirus, coronaviruses). Table 3 indicates that DFA and culture were, as expected, less sensitive than PCR for most targets. However, DFA was more sensitive than PCR for a small number of specific targets and assays (i. Among all the multiplex assays tested, Seeplex RV15 was the most sensitive for detecting all targets except for enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. All multiplex assays had good sensitivity for the detection of influenza A (93.7-98.4%). Influenza B sensitivity was good in all multiplex assays (100%) except for RVP Fast (64.9%). The superior performance of Seeplex RV15 for RSV (100% sensitivity) reflected strong performance for both RSVA and RSVB, whereas the decreased sensitivity of other assays reflected a weaker performance for either target (i.e. Resplex II v2.0: RSVA 90.4%, RSVB 79.3%, and RVP: RSVA 85.5%, RSVB 98.3%). Similarly, variability in the sensitivity of individual targets of the four parainfluenza viruses resulted in variation in the overall sensitivity. Again, Seeplex RV15 showed good sensitivity for all four types (85.7-100%), while Resplex II v2.0 had reduced sensitivity for PIV4 (60%), RVP had reduced sensitivity for PIV1 (71.4%) and 3 (71.4%), and RVP Fast had reduced sensitivity for PIV1 (46.7%), 2 (77.8%) and 3 (42.8%). Sensitivity for detecting hMPV was good for Seeplex RV15, RVP and RVP Fast (92.3-97.4%), and acceptable for Resplex II v2.0 (82%). However, performance for adenovirus, an important respiratory pathogen, was very variable, ranging from 52.4% (RVP Fast) to 100% (Seeplex RV15), probably reflecting the variation in serotype coverage among the assays.",

Seeplex RV15 and RVP Fast detected 100% of bocavirus infections, while the sensitivity of Resplex II v2.0 was only 75%. Detection of enterovirus and rhinovirus was the most inconsistent. Although the specific targets for each multiplex assay are proprietary, it is known that the highly conserved regions of the 5\u00a2NTR region of either rhinoviruses or enteroviruses, will also amplify members of the other genus. Thus, some assays, such as the RVP and RVP Fast assays, have combined the enterovirus and rhinovirus targets, because developing specific targets for each genus outside of the 5\u00a2NTR region may compromise sensitivity of detection, especially of the rhinoviruses. This is possibly the case with the Seeplex RV15 assay, which separates enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, but has a lower sensitivity than the other assays. Though the Resplex II v2.0 assay differentiates between enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, the occurrence of 38.4% of positive specimens testing positive for both targets, suggests that there may be cross-reactivity between them.",

In the case of influenza A, knowledge of the subtype is important with respect to predicting the activity of antiviral agents such as the adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors. In addition to increased sensitivity and number of viruses detected, multiplex assays permit the improved identification of cases of infection with multiple agents, which may be clinically significant, especially in immune compromised individuals. In our study, we found that two or more viruses were present in 10.9% of specimens (16.3% of positive specimens). Bocavirus and coronaviruses were the viruses most commonly associated with multiple agent infection, followed by human metapneumovirus, the parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus and the entero/rhinoviruses. Influenza A/B and RSV were the least likely to be detected in the presence of another virus. The role of multiple viral agents in affecting the clinical course of disease is at present unknown and worthy of further study. With respect to the technical performance of the different multiplex assays, the following issues were identified: Seeplex RV15 was designed as a two-step RT-PCR format necessitating a separate RT (cDNA) assay, though a new one-step procedure has been developed. It was the only assay that required three PCR master mixes with five targets in each one plus the internal control. It was also the only assay that incorporated positive controls for all 15 viral targets, which is considered an additional quality control feature of the assay. Seeplex RV15 was the assay with the shortest post-PCR step, especially for a small number of specimens when using the Lab 901 Screen Tape \u00d2 system (maximum five specimens per run). In contrast, the Resplex II v2.0, RVP and RVP Fast use a 96-well microtitre plate format on the Luminex platform, permitting high throughput analysis.",

            "text": "Practical considerations in most laboratories regarding the feasibility and the direct and indirect costs of introducing multiplex molecular testing for respiratory viruses have led to a relatively slow routine implementation of this methodology. Mahony et al. [15] have shown that RVP employed as the first-line diagnostic tool in children was the least costly strategy, compared with DFA and culture, DFA alone or DFA plus RVP, when the prevalence of infection was \u202111%. The cost of molecular testing is offset by its more efficient use of labour than conventional DFA and culture and by savings to the healthcare system when additional testing and hospitalization can be avoided by knowledge of a test result with high sensitivity and specificity. Operationally, molecular methods also allow virology laboratories to continue to function, even in the event that viral culture cannot be carried out due to biosafety issues.",

This is important, as traditional seasonal H1 subtyping molecular assays will not react with the pandemic strain and it is expected that the 2009 pandemic strain may become the predominant circulating seasonal H1 strain in the immediate post-pandemic period.",

However, it will be important to develop more effective clinical and laboratory algorithms for their timely and optimal use and to study their impact on patient care in different populations in different clinical settings. Influenza, RSV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and hMPV have been well established as leading causes of respiratory infection among infants and children [16] [17] [18] . However, the role of rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, bocavirus and coronaviruses as copathogens in upper respiratory tract infection or as agents of lower respiratory tract infection, has been less well investigated, and will be aided by studies using this technology [19] .",

Amplification from a selected subpopulation of specimens was performed using the Astra influenza Screen and Type (Astra Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany), Resplex II Plus Panel PRE (Qiagen) and Seeplex Influenza A/B Subtyping (Seegene) assays. The Astra influenza Screen & Type triplex assay was designed to detect seasonal INFA and pandemic H1N1 2009 INFA in a real-time RT-PCR format and used the Rotor-Gene 3000 instrument (Corbett Research, Mortlake, NSW, Australia). This assay was chosen as the reference standard due to its performance in a proficiency panel for the detection of H1N1 2009 INFA, in which 22 laboratories participated, using 18 different assays. The Astra kit was found to have the highest sensitivity of detection compared with all other assays, including the CDC H1N1 2009 assay (26th Annual Clinical Virology Symposium, abstract S35). Specimens were also tested by the Resplex II Plus Panel PRE (same targets as Resplex II Panel v2.0 plus pandemic H1N1 2009 INFA) and the Seeplex Influenza A/B Subtyping assay (INFA, INFA-H1, pandemic H1N1 2009 INFA, INFA-H3 and INFB). Amplicons from the Resplex II Plus Panel PRE and Seeplex Influenza A/B Subtyping assays were detected using the LiquiChip 200 and the MultiNA instrument, a microchip electrophoresis system for DNA/ RNA analysis (Shimadzu Biotech, Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Each assay had an IC to detect inhibition of amplification. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the Hospital for Sick Children.",
