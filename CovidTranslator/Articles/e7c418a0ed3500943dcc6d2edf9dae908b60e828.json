However, the neutralization test lacks the sensitivity to reliably detect antibody in nasal washings. A haemagglutination-inhibition test has been developed which detected both serum and nasal secretion antibody to rhinoviruses, but prior concentration of nasal washings was still required to detect the local antibody (Reed and Hall, 1973) . Furthermore, not all rhinovirus serotypes haemagglutinate, and so this latter test has not gained any widespread use. We have therefore developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects rhinovirus class-specific antibody in both serum and nasal secretion. In this study, we describe the new assay and its application in the study of the immune response following inoculation with a rhinovirus.",

From these 21 volunteers, 12 were chosen for further study such that a wide range of responses to HRV-EL challenge was represented (4 from each group). The titres of the various irnmunoglobulins specific for HRV-EL were measured by the sandwich ELBA. Fig. 3 shows the geometric mean titre of rhinovirus specific antibody measured by both the ELISA and the microneutralization test for the paired sera of the 4 volunteers in each group. The figure suggests that detection of HRV-EL specific IgA measured by ELISA (Fig. 3b) was a better indicator of the group susceptibility to infection than the detection of specific IgG (Fig. 3a) or neutralizing antibody (Fig. 3~) . Thus, the GMT of the preinfection HRV-EL specific serum IgA was much higher among volunteers who despite challenge did not become infected than among volunteers who did become infected. Furthermore, after infection the GMT of HRV-EL specific IgA and of neutralizing antibody showed substantial rises in the sera of all the volunteers who became infected, whereas the GMT of HRV-EL specific IgG showed only very small rises following challenge among the symptomatic volunteers. Indeed, the level of preexisting HRV-EL specific IgG was generally high and it neither correlated with serum neutralizing antibody rises nor appeared to be relevant for protection against virus challenge. Fig. 4 shows the mean ODs obtained when the nasal washings from the 4 volunteers in each group collected on days 3, 5 and 7 after inoculation were tested at a 1:40 dilution in the sandwich ELISA, for both HRV-EL specific IgG and IgA. The mean OD values for each group showed a distinct pattern. Thus, volunteers who were infected and became symptomatic (Fig. 4a,d) , showed HRV-EL specific increases in both the IgG and IgA immunoglobulin classes after infection. In contrast, volunteers who did not become infected (Fig. 4c,f) , had higher levels of local rhinovirus specific IgA by day 3 after challenge which then fell off during the fol- Fig. 4 .

            "text": "The ELISA described in this study is a simple, rapid assay which detects rhinovirus class-specific immunoglobulins in both the serum and nasal secretion, It is an extremely sensitive technique, detecting HRV-EL specific IgG and IgA antibody in postinfection serum at dilutions lo\"-and lo*-fold greater respectively than the end-point dilution for the neutralization test. In unconcentrated nasal wash- ings, it consistently detected HRV-EL specific antibody of both the IgG and IgA classes whereas the neutralization test lacks the sensitivity to reliably detect this local specific antibody. This, we feel, is an important feature of our rhinovirus ELISA system since it is now possible to look more closely at the immune response following a rhinovirus infection and perhaps be able to identify the feature(s) of the humoral immune response which may be relevant for protection against reinfection with homologous or heterologous virus. Indeed, preliminary data presented in this study suggest that the presence of rhinovirus specific IgA in both serum and nasal secretion appears to be more important for protection against reinfection than does the presence of specific IgG. Thus, the group of volunteers who showed no evidence of infection despite challenge with HRV-EL ('not infected' group), had high levels of HRV-EL specific IgA in both their sera and nasal secretions. Furthermore, they did not show rises in specific serum IgG, IgA or neutralizing antibody. In contrast, volunteers who became subclinically infected ('infected, no colds' group), had low levels of HRV-EL specific IgA in their serum and nasal secretions before infection, and showed rises in both specific serum IgA and neutralizing antibody after infection. In addition, those volunteers who became infected and who were symptomatic ('colds' group) also had low levels of preinfection specific IgA and showed rises in specific serum IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibody as well as specific IgG and IgA in nasal secretion after infection. These data demonstrate the potential of our ELBA in detecting different components of the humorai 'immune response following a rhinovirus infection. This may be important should vaccination against rhinovirus infection be contemplated. However, in view of the fact that the number of volunteers in this study was small (4 per group), confirmation and elaboration of these findings will have to await a much larger study that needs to involve many more volunteers. The present ELISA data were obtained with serum specimens ideally collected for the measurement of neutralizing antibody titres, i.e., a prechallenge serum specimen and another 2-3 weeks later. Hence, measurements made with these samples may not be optimal for detecting antibody rises by ELISA. Also, the nasal washings used in this study were collected primarily for virus isolation and not for antibody measurement. Therefore, these specimens were also probably not optimal for measuring the sequential appearance and decline of the various rhinovirus specific immu~oglobuIins. Furthermore, a series of preinfection nasal washes would ideally be required to establish the presence and day-to-day variation of any preexisting local specific antibody. Since rhinovirus infection is localized and shortlived it presents a relatively light antigenic load, and so it is expected that a sensitive assay such as the ELISA would detect rapid immunoglobulin responses very soon after inoculation rather than 3 weeks later. Indeed, the use of ELISA systems to detect class-specific responses to other respiratory viruses such as parainfluenza virus and influenza A virus indicated that such responses appear within 3-6 days of onset of symptoms (Van der Logt et al., 1985; Leinikki and Passila, 1976 ). Therefore, it is possible that in this study we have missed the peak of the rhinovirus specific immunoglobulin responses at least in the serum. We are now planning a more extensive and detailed study in human volunteers whereby closely",

            "text": "spaced serum and nasal secretion specimens will be collected so that we can define more precisely the time course of appearance of specific immunoglobulins after a rhinovirus challenge. Antibody to several other respiratory viruses, such as influenza A and coronavirus, has been detected using indirect ELISA systems in which the virus is directly bound to the solid phase (Murphy et al., 1980; Kraaijeveld et al., 1980) . However, picornaviruses may be prone to changes in their surface structure after direct electrostatic binding which reveal internal antigenic regions (McCullough et al., 1985) . Indeed, using an indirect ELISA in which rhinovirus antigen was immobilised on the plate, we have found high levels of HRV-EL antibody in both pre-and postinfection human sera, and hence no differences in antibody levels between the paired sera could be demonstrated.Such antibody probably persists from previous infections by heterologous serotypes and may cross-react with our ELrhinovirus after interaction with the solid phase has exposed common internal regions. On the other hand, in the same indirect ELISA the rabbit sera showed clear rises of HRV-EL specific antibody after immunization. This may be explained by the fact that the rabbit immune system has not encountered any previous rhinovirus other than that used for hyperimmunization, and so the indirect ELISA detected no cross-reacting antibody in the preimmunization serum. In the sandwich ELISA described here, the solid phase was coated with a rhinovirus specific antibody which captured the rhinovirus antigen and hence the surface structure was less likely to have been distorted.Thus, we were able to detect an immune response to the homologous rhinovirus infection in both human sera and nasal secretions.We feel that there is still considerable scope for improving the present ELISA system. For example, preliminary results suggest that the use of purified virus as antigen instead of crude tissue culture fluids containing virus will result in increased sensitivity (W.S. Barclay, unpublished data). Also, if D-type rhinovirus particles were purified and separated from C-type particles, and used as antigen, it is likely that an immunoglobulin response more closely associated with the infecting homologous virus would be detected rather than any heterologous reaction (Lonberg-Holm and Yin, 1973) . The existence of such heterologous reactions is expected in view of the fact that most human adults have experienced many rhinovirus infections.This may explain to some extent the detection of consistently high levels of rhinovirus specific IgG in preinfection sera, and our failure to show a good correlation with antibody rises detected by our neutralization tests since these latter assays detect rises in antibody to the infecting homologous virus. Conversely, the use of purified C-type or denatured rhinovirus particles as antigen may allow the detection of broader antibody reactivity in the immune response following rhinovirus infection. However, the relevance of these measurements in terms of protection against reinfection by the homologous or a heterologous rhinovirus, or whether such measurements will consistently detect diagnostic rises following a recent rhinovirus infection will have to await future experiments in human volunteers designed to provide answers to these questions. vations of rhinovirus infections, 1965-1969 ",
