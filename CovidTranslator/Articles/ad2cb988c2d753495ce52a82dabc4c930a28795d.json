Five hundred fifty-two fecal samples were taken from 56 calves, 28 from each farm and, in the vaccinated herd, 11/281 samples (3.91%) taken from six different calves tested positive for RVA while in the unvaccinated herd, 3/271 samples (1.11%) taken from 3 different calves tested positive. The genotyping of the VP7 genes showed 91.2% nucleotide sequence identity to G6 genotype (NCDV strain), and for the VP4 gene, strains from the vaccinated herd were 96.6% related to B223 strain, while strains from the unvaccinated herd were 88% related to P[5] genotype (UK strain). Genotypes found in this study were G6P[11] in the vaccinated herd and G6P [5] in the unvaccinated herd. All calves infected with rotavirus presented an episode of diarrhea in the first month of life, and the discrepancy between the genotypes found in the commercial vaccine (G6P[1] and G10P [11]) and the rotavirus strains circulating in both vaccinated and unvaccinated herds show the importance of keeping constant surveillance in order to avoid potential causes of vaccination failure.",

The non-enveloped virion has a triple-layered capsid surrounding 11 dsRNA segments that encode 6 structural (VP1-4, VP6, and VP7) and 5 nonstructural (NSP1-NSP5/6) proteins . Since VP4 and VP7 induce the production of neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity, these proteins play a central role in strain selection for vaccine production and form the basis of a binary classification system, namely, the G (glycosylated) and P (protease-sensitive) genotypes (Estes and Greenberg 2013) . To date, 27 G and 38 P genotypes with different combinations have been described (Matthijnssens et al. 2011; Trojnar et al. 2013) . Regarding bovine rotavirus infections, G6, G8, and G10 together with P[1], P[5], and P[11], respectively, are the G and P genotypes most commonly found (Alkan et al. 2010) .",

Fecal samples were prepared as 50% (v/v) suspensions in DEPC-treated ultrapure water and centrifuged at 5000\u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Total RNA was extracted from 250 \u03bcL of the supernatant using TRIzol Reagent\u2122 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and cDNA was synthesized using random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as per manufacturer's protocol. Different PCR runs were performed using primers Beg9, End9, End9CRW8, End9UK (for G genotypes) or con3 and con2 (for P genotypes) (Gouvea et al. 1994a; Gouvea et al. 1994b; Gentsch et al. 1992; Silva et al. 2015) . Therefore, 2.5 \u03bcL cDNA was added into the reaction mix comprising 1\u00d7 PCR Buffer\u2122 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.5 \u03bcM of each forward and reverse primers, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , and 3 U Platinum Taq Polymerase\u2122 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and nuclease-free water to obtain a final volume of 25 \u03bcL. This solution was then heated to 94\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles, with 1 cycle consisting of 1 min at 94\u00b0C, 1.5 min at 50\u00b0C, and 1 min at 72\u00b0C; and a final extension step of 10 min at 72\u00b0C. After completion of thermocycles, PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized by UV transillumination.",

(2011) , all calves that tested positive for rotavirus detection in feces presented an episode of diarrhea in the first 30 days of life. This finding is relevant since most of the cross-sectional field research performed investigating RVA diarrhea, consider calves in which RVA is found in normal feces to be asymptomatic. In the report by Oliveira-Filho et al. (2007) and Cho et al. (2013) , bovine RVA was only found in diarrheic feces, however, this sort of information is rare in the literature consulted, which can lead to misinformation. It is quite likely that newborn calves infected with RVA will always manifest an episode of diarrhea, and that the virus can be eliminated in all stages of clinical course of the disease, including in moments in which feces are normal. Thus, it would be relevant to perform more longitudinal studies in which fecal samples are taken in predetermined moments, as well as whenever the calves manifest diarrhea, in order to evaluate a larger number of animals to confirm these findings and if they are related to the virulence of genotypes of RVA. Nourmohammadzadeh et al. (2012) reported that the higher prevalence of rotavirus infection occurs in calves aged between 2 and 4 weeks, and lower in animals in the first week of life, which agrees with the results of the present report, in which none of the positive calves were in their first week of life, four calves were in the second week of life, four calves were in the third week of life and one calf was in the fourth week of life. Bartels et al. (2010) , evaluating the prevalence and risk factors for the presence of enteropathogens in normal and diarrheic feces of 424 calves aged between 1 and 3 weeks of life reported that the prevalence of normal consistency feces was 57.1%, semiliquid feces was 23.8%, and liquid feces was 19.1%. In the current study, considering the same age groups of calves, percentages found were 72.3 and 71% of normal consistency feces, 19.4 and 19% of semiliquid feces, and 8.30 and 10% of liquid feces, in groups V and NV, respectively. These authors also reported that the percentage of calves with diarrheic feces in the second week of life was higher than in calves with 1 or 3 weeks of age, which was similar to the findings of the present study, in which the percentage of diarrheic calves in their second week of life was 60.7%. This finding is attributable to the immune status of calves, which is higher in the first week of life due to passive immunity provided by colostrum, and gradually decreases through a natural process of catabolism of immunoglobulins, making calves more susceptible to infection in the second and third weeks of life. Since most cases of RVA diarrhea occur within these age groups, at 4 weeks of age, calves are normally immune to infection through natural resistance (Chase et al. 2008; Coura et al. 2015) .",

In experimental studies, rotavirus excretion has been reported to last up to 10 days (Fernandez et al. 1998) . This difference might be attributable to the method of detection of RVA in feces, since both field studies employed PAGE as a screening method for rotavirus in feces, and the limitation of this method lies in the need for a certain concentration of virus particles for the test to be positive, while in the experimental study cited, the method used (ELISA) is considered a test able to detect smaller amounts of virus present in feces than PAGE.",

According to Alkan et al. (2010) , several factors can contribute to vaccine failures, especially vaccination management. In the present study, there was a special attention with the conservation and protocol of vaccination employed, in order to avoid the risk of vaccine failure due to inappropriate conservation of the vaccine or a longer period of time between the second dose of vaccine and parturition. However, contrary to expectations, incidence of rotavirus diarrhea was higher in group V than in group NV, which might be due to differences in herd size, exposure to virus, and management procedures between herds (Meganck et al. 2015) .",

Also, in Argentina, the most prevalent genotypic combinations reported were G6P[11] in dairy herds and G6P [5] in beef herds (Badaracco et al. 2013) . Parre\u00f1o et al. (2004) reported that the protective effect of high titers of serum antibodies against bovine RVA significantly reduces the occurrence of diarrhea caused by rotavirus, but does not eliminate the virus from the herd, which reinforces the concept that commercial vaccines currently used are not designed to prevent rotavirus infection, but rather to decrease morbidity, severity of diarrhea, and mortality in field conditions. Although this might have impact in some of the economic costs associated with neonatal calf diarrhea, it does not reduce the expenses of treatment aiming to avoid secondary bacterial infections and might still impact on the potential development and performance of calves in their productive life, given that all the animals positive for RVA detection in the present study manifested at least one episode of diarrhea throughout the first month of life.",
