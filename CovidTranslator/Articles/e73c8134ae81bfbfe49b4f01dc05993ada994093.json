Generally, native pAPN is a mixed protein which consists of the full-length pAPN protein (aa 1-963, 150 kDa), the B subunit of pAPN (aa 1-572, 95 kDa) and the C subunit of pAPN (aa 573-963, 50 kDa), because of trypsin cleavage at the potential site Arg 572 of the pAPN molecule (Delmas et al. 1994 ). In the fulllength pAPN, the TGEV binding site is mainly located in the C subunit of pAPN (pAPN-C) and the catalytic site of pAPN is located in the B subunit (Jongeneel et al. 1989) . APN enzymatic activity is not, however, involved in the process of TGEV entry into the host cells (Delmas et al. 1994) .",

The ELISA procedure was as follows: TGEV particles purified by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation were used to coat the ELISA plate wells. After blocking with 50 g skimmed milk l -1 , the purified recombinant pAPN-C proteins (1 mg l -1 ) were added to the wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. After washing three times with PBST, 100 ll mouse monoclonal antibody against the His 6 tag (1:1,000 dilution in PBST) was added to the wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The plates were washed three times and then incubated with 100 ll HRPconjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:8000 dilution in PBST) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Color development was carried out using TMB solution as the substrate and the reaction was stopped with 50 ll 2 M H 2 SO 4 . The A 450 was measured. The purified His-tag protein and native pAPN protein were used as negative and positive control, respectively. The sample OD 450 value/negative control OD 450 value (S/N) [2 was determined as the positive standard.",

            "text": "Aminopeptidase N (APN) is a member of the membrane-bound metallopeptidase family, and has a wide distribution on the surfaces of diverse cell types in humans and most mammals (Lendeckel et al. 2000) . APN is a cellular receptor for several coronaviruses (Yeager et al. 1992; Benbacer et al. 1997; Hegyi and Kolb 1998) . For swine coronavirus TGEV, the receptor and the catalytic functions, associated with the C and B subunits of pAPN respectively, involve distinct domains of the molecule. Thus pAPN-C holds significant potential for designing an anti-virus strategy against TGEV. In this study, seven overlapping truncated forms of the entire pAPN-C protein were expressed in Escherichia coli. Protein purification, immunogenicity analysis, and tests of the virusbinding activity of these recombinant proteins were carried out in succession. For protein expression, the vector pET-32a with a medium-sized His-tagged protein was used to generate recombinant pAPN-C proteins. The 18 kDa Trx-His-S Tag protein of the vector pET-32a promoted highlevel expression of the target proteins while having little effect on the expressed proteins (Yang et al. 2003; Gasparian et al. 2007 ). At present, many measures have been reported for the purification of the recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli (Li 2011; Kim et al. 2011; Tzou et al. 2011) . In our study, high-purity recombinant pAPN-C proteins were obtained from inclusion bodies by the gel-cutting purification method combined with dialysis refolding, which had been verified as a simple, time-saving, and inexpensive method (Liu et al. 2009; Sun et al. 2011) . A polyclonal antibody against native pAPN was used to perform ELISA and western blot analysis of the binding competence of the purified recombinant proteins. The advantage of the polyclonal antibody against the native pAPN was that it recognized any proteins which were consistent with the structure of native pAPN. In our study, all purified recombinant pAPN-C proteins reacted more strongly with antiserum against the native pAPN in both ELISA and western blot. This result provided strong evidence that the purified recombinant proteins possessed similar biological activity to the natural pAPN protein.",

In this study, a monoclonal antibody against His-tag was used to analyze the binding activity of the truncated pAPN-C recombinant proteins with TGEV by an indirect ELISA using the purified TGEV particles as the coating antigen. Of these truncated recombinant proteins, rpAPN-C2 (aa 623-722) and rpAPN-C3 (aa 673-772) showed the highest virus-binding activity. However, rpAPN-C1 (aa 573-672), which overlaps rpAPN-C2, showed low virus-binding activity, while n p A P N r p A P N -C 1 r p A P N -C 2 r p A P N -C 3 r p A P N -C 4 r p A P N -C 5 r p A P N -C 6 r p A P N -C 7 S/N value Fig. 3 Virus-binding activity of the truncated pAPN-C proteins rpAPN-C4 (aa 717-822), overlapping rpAPN-C3, showed medium virus-binding activity. These results suggest that the overlapping region (aa 673-722) between rpAPN-C2 and rpAPN-C3 may be a crucial amino acid region for virus-binding activity of pAPN-C. In addition, the recombinant proteins rpAPN-C4 (aa 717-822) and rpAPN-C5 (aa 773-872) were found to have medium virus-binding activity. The rpAPN-C4 region had been reported previously by Delmas et al. (1994) . In this report, the potential virus-binding determinants of pAPN-C are analyzed using a series of truncated recombinant proteins, and the results will provide valuable information for further understanding the function of pAPN-C in infection.",
