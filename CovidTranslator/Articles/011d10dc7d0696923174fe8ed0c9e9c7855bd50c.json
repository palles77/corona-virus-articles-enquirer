They include the orthomyxoviruses (influenza virus), paramyxoviruses (parainfluenza viruses, measles virus and respiratory syncytial virus), adenoviruses, herpesviruses (cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus and herpes simplex virus) and formerly variola virus (smallpox). Many of these viruses are of course also responsible for non-respiratory disease. The role of papillomavirus in neoplasia of the respiratory tract is discussed on page 535 and parvovirus is mentioned as a cause of hydrops fetalis on page 43. The role of herpes-like viruses in Kaposi's sarcoma and body cavity-based lymphomas is discussed on pages 635 and 734 respectively. Viral infection of the lower respiratory tract occurs in three general situations: infections confined to the respiratory tract, systemic infections that involve the lung and opportunistic infection of the lungs in the immunocompromised (Box 5.1.1).",

Thus, influenza, adenovirus, varicella and herpes simplex pneumonia are all characterised by epithelial cell necrosis (Figs 5.1.2 and 5.1.3), whilst respiratory syncytial virus and measles virus stimulate mitotic division and cause characteristic proliferative changes in the bronchioles and alveoli respectively. The distribution of the changes is often characteristic of a particular virus, but not specific. Thus, within the alveoli, influenza tends to affect the epithelium diffusely. The effects of adenovirus, on the other hand, are generally maximal in the region of the terminal bronchioles, whilst varicella pneumonia is also focal but lacks any particular relationship to the acinar architecture. Viral inclusions are evident in certain viral pneumonias, notably measles, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, varicella and herpes simplex pneumonia, but not in others.",

            "text": "Influenza is epidemic almost annually in the winter months in many parts of the world and at long intervals the disease occurs in pandemic form, notably in 1889- 92, 1918-19, 1957-58, 1968 and 2009 . It is estimated that in the pandemic that followed the world war of 1914-18, some 20-30 million people died from the disease in little more than a year, more than were killed in the war itself. Until 1933 it was widely believed that the disease was caused by the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae. The discovery in 1933 that the disease could be transmitted to ferrets by intranasal inoculation of filtered washings from the noses of patients established its viral nature. 9 There are several types of influenza virus. All are originally bird viruses, some crossing from birds to species such as humans, pigs, horses and seals. Once established in the new species they undergo constant changes in their antigenic makeup, a feature that necessitates the constant manufacture of new vaccines. The strains involved in most serious human infections belong to types A and B, with the former much the more virulent. Outbreaks of infection with influenza A occur most years, with epidemics every 5-15 years. Influenza B also causes epidemics, but less frequently. Influenza C does not appear to cause epidemics. Successive epidemics appear to be decreasing in severity, possibily due to natural selection involving evolutionary changes that favour transmissibility over pathogenicity. 10 Antigenic lability involves changes in the principal surface antigens of the virus, haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Minor changes ('antigenic drift') are seen progressively from season to season. Major changes ('antigenic shift') due to acquisition of a new haemagglutinin occur periodically and are responsible for the emergence of new subtypes to which populations have little immunity and which therefore cause epidemics or pandemics. Influenza epidemics generally occur in the winter months and often start in countries south of the equator or in the east, giving northern and western countries time to prepare and distribute appropriate vaccines to those most at risk, notably the infirm. Influenza A viruses are named after their haemagglutinins (H1, H2, etc.), their neuraminidases (N1, N2, N3, etc.), and the place where and year when the strain was first identified. Thus, the 1968 pandemic virus was H3N2 influenza A/Hong Kong/68.",

            "text": "The haemagglutinin molecule enables the virus to attach to host cells prior to infecting them and neuraminidase permits new virus particles to bud from the cell membrane. Although there are considerable differences between the influenza viruses that infect different species, the haemagglutinin molecule's lability occasionally permits its virus to switch from one host species to another, in which the disease is likely to spread in epidemic form. It appears that all the devastating influenza pandemics of the twentieth century, such as Spanish flu in 1918, Asian flu in 1957 and Hong Kong flu in 1968, were caused by viruses that made such a switch from birds to humans. 11 Recent genomic studies of the H1N1 virus responsible for the 1918 pandemic suggest that it was an avian virus that adapted to humans, rather than developing by a reassortment of avian and human viruses, as in the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. 12 The switch from animals to humans in the 'wet markets' of the Far East is also relevant to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), described on page 163. In 2004, the H5N1 strain of the influenza A virus devastated flocks of poultry in Asia and was responsible for the deaths of some humans from what was termed 'Asian bird flu' . 13, 14 This strain was not very infective to humans, possibly because the temperature of the human nose (32\u00b0C) is too cold for a virus whose natural host is the avian intestine (temperature 40\u00b0C). 15, 16 However, when the virus succeeded in infecting humans it was particularly virulent for two reasons. First, it was resistant to the antiviral effects of human interferons and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, a property acquired by a simple mutation in the non-structural gene resulting in a change from aspartate to glutamate at position 92. 17 Second, it preferentially targeted the alveolar rather than the tracheobronchial epithelium. 18 The year 2009 saw swine influenza A/H1N1 virus switch to humans and exhibit the ability to spread from case to case, rapidly assuming pandemic proportions. Pigs are unusual in that their respiratory epithelium has receptors for both avian and human influenza viruses so that they can be infected with these viruses simultaneously, providing the ideal environment for genetic reassortment. This appears to have taken place as the 2009 swine influenza virus shows a novel reassortment of genes derived from swine, avian and human influenza viruses, a feature that is probably responsible for this virus being able to infect both pigs and humans. Unlike seasonal influenza, the disease made its first appearance in the northern hemisphere, apparently originating in Mexico, and its first impact was during the summer months. There was much mild disease but again, in contrast to seasonal influenza, severe respiratory failure was seen in young, previously healthy persons, as is often the case in influenza pandemics. This feature is not well explained but it is possible that the healthy mount a more vigorous immune response that is in some way detrimental to the host. Older people were less susceptible but more likely to die when infected. 19 However, one year later it was apparent that the pandemic had not proved as severe as first thought.",

Areas of haemorrhage are present and may be extensive. The mucosa of the bronchial tree is very hyperaemic. Microscopically, the alveoli contain a fibrin-rich oedema fluid, which is often frankly haemorrhagic. Macrophages may be numerous in the exudate and hyaline membranes are often found lining the alveoli. T lymphocytes are often prominent in the alveolar interstitium while focal necrosis of alveolar walls and thrombosis of capillaries are conspicuous features in the parts most severely affected. 26 Postmortem examination of two victims of the H5N1 virus showed similar evidence of diffuse alveolar damage but it was also found that viral replication in the respiratory tract had resulted in particularly high levels of cytokines such as interferons and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, which, with the resultant haemophagocytic syndrome, was considered to be the chief cause of death. 27 Generally, however, H5N1 viral pneumonia shows no special features and it may be difficult to distinguish the changes brought about by the H5N1 virus from those caused by viruses such as that responsible for SARS or by factors such as acid aspiration or oxygen toxicity. More specific tests such as viral isolation, in situ hybridisation and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are required to confirm H5N1 infection.",

            "text": "Although pneumonia is the usual cause of death in epidemics of influenza, it is often a secondary bacterial pneumonia that is responsible. Neutrophilic exudates, organising pneumonia and bronchiolitis obliterans are then added to or replace the changes seen in uncomplicated cases. 22, 24, [30] [31] [32] [33] The impact an influenza epidemic has on respiratory death rates in general is shown in Figure 5 . 1.5. Before the discovery of the influenza virus in 1933, the changes that are now known to be due to the viral infection were often confused with those of complicating infections, mainly caused by bacteria. Haemophilus influenzae was first isolated in the 1889-90 pandemic and so named because its discoverer, Pfeiffer, recovered it from a large proportion of cases and mistook it for the cause of influenza. In the 1918-19 pandemic H. influenzae was again found, along with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. 32 With the advent of antibiotics, resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus emerged and in the 1957-58 pandemic staphylococcal superinfection of the lungs was the major fatal complication of influenza. In the 1968 epidemic Streptococcus pneumoniae was the principal bacterial pathogen in the elderly and Staphylococcus aureus in the young. 30 The relationship of the staphylococcus and the influenza virus has been much studied and there is evidence that each promotes the growth of the other. 34 Thus, certain staphylococci have a protein in their cell wall that binds to the Fc region of immunoglobulin G. In the presence of anti-influenzal serum this protein enhances staphylococcal binding to cells infected by the influenza virus 35 and in this way the staphylococcus takes advantage of the host's immune reaction to the influenza virus. In turn, the staphylococcus aids entry of the Other respiratory causes Pneumonia Influenza virus into the host's cell. It does this by secreting a protease that activates a viral surface protein necessary for penetration of the host's cells 36 : normally such proteases are in short supply, so limiting the rate at which influenza virus can infect cells and reproduce. The relationship of influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection has been studied in less detail but there is evidence of similar enhancement of bacterial adherence to tracheal epithelium following influenza infection. 37 Parainfluenza Parainfluenza is caused by the parainfluenza viruses, not by Haemophilus parainfluenzae. It is commoner in children and particularly affects the larynx, causing croup. There may be necrosis of the mucosa as in influenza (Fig. 5.1.6A) , and quite frequently small polypoid growths of the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium develop, similar to those associated with infection by respiratory syncytial virus (see below). In the lung there is hyperplasia of the alveolar epithelium and a serous exudate containing increased numbers of macrophages is seen. In immunosuppressed individuals, parainfluenza type III virus may result in a giant cell pneumonia that is indistinguishable from that of measles except that the inclusion bodies typical of measles pneumonia are not a feature ( Fig. 5.1.6B ). [38] [39] [40] [41] Respiratory syncytial virus Epidemiology Respiratory syncytial virus was first isolated in 1956 from an outbreak of coryza in a colony of chimpanzees and its infectivity for Man was shown when one of the investigators of this epizootic illness contracted the disease. It has since been shown that the virus frequently infects the lower respiratory passages of Man, particularly the young. 42 Specific neutralising antibodies indicative of an earlier infection are found in the serum of almost all children over the age of 5 years in Britain. Most children merely develop a cold but a few suffer from severe bronchiolitis, which in the developing world is an important cause of death in the very young. 42a,b Those that recover are prone to develop recurrent wheeze later in childhood. 42c The immunity infection conveys is incomplete and reinfections may occur throughout life.",

            "text": "Particularly important is the bronchiolitis that respiratory syncytial virus is prone to cause in infants. The conductive airways of small infants are quite narrow and easily blocked by relatively small amounts of inflammatory exudate: because of this, fatal asphyxia is liable to follow respiratory syncytial virus infection. This is particularly the case in those who have airflow obstruction as a consequence of prematurity and its treatment. Several epidemics of acute bronchiolitis due to this virus have been described among infants. These outbreaks are often remarkably focal in distribution, affecting only a comparatively small area or community. Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and those who have congenital heart disease or are immunocompromised are particularly at risk and units specialising in these underlying conditions have to guard against nosocomial spread of infection. [43] [44] [45] However, most children with respiratory syncytial virus infection have no predisposing factors and even previously healthy children may suffer fatal infection. 42, 46 Pathogenesis It is notable that infants under six months of age are particularly prone to respiratory syncytial virus infection. Although this is a period when the infant benefits from the presence of maternal antibodies, placental antibody transmission is selective, being better for immunoglobulin G than A. Breast-feeding protects against respiratory syncytial virus infection, 47 presumably by virtue of breast milk being rich in immunoglobulin A. It has been noted that infants immunized against the virus and subsequently infected naturally, suffer a more severe illness than those not so immunised, 48 suggesting that the damage is mediated immunologically. 49, 50 This is supported by the finding that the typical bronchiolitis is characterised by scanty virus whereas in the rarer pneumonic form of the disease the virus is abundant. This is compatible with the bronchiolitis representing an adverse immune reaction and the pneumonia being the result of direct viral damage to the lungs. 51 The cytokine profile suggests that the reaction involved in the bronchiolitis involves a predominantly type 2 response characterised by high interleukin-10/interleukin-12 and interleukin-4/\u03b3interferon ratios. 52 Suspicion has fallen upon the formaldehyde inactivation of the vaccine creating reactive carbonyl groups on the antigen. 52a Passive immunisation, conferred by monthly injection, is free of the hazards induced by active immunisation and is recommended for high-risk babies. 53 ",

Between 2000 and 2007 mortality from measles fell by 74% worldwide and by 89% in Africa, where it was formerly a major cause of death in childhood. The Americas were declared free of endemic measles transmission in 2002 and cases there now occur only as a result of its importation from other countries. 60, 61 The disease has not yet been eradicated in the UK, partly because unfounded claims that the vaccine is responsible for autism led to declining vaccine uptake with consequent focal outbreaks of measles. 62 Other European countries still experiencing large outbreaks include the Ukraine, Switzerland and Austria. Where measles is prevalent, the incidence is usually highest in the early spring, when droplet infections are particularly rife. The epidemics have a remarkably consistent biennial character (see Fig. 5.1.8) and the explanation of this has been the subject of several interesting hypotheses. The one most favoured envisages waning immunity over the succeeding 2 years in those children who had only a subclinical illness in the last epidemic. With the influx of two further entries into infant schools, a new population of susceptible children is formed that is liable to contract overt disease when the seasonal conditions are again favourable for the spread of the virus. In this way a fresh epidemic develops. Overt clinical disease, on the other hand, confers lifelong immunity.",

The cause is usually one of the common bacterial pathogens but it can be another virus taking advantage of the patient's debility and impaired cellular immunity. Measles virus infection is characterised by both the development of a strong antiviral immune response and abnormalities of immune regulation: there is often a poor skin response to common antigens and helper/suppressor T-cell ratios may be low in both the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage, suggesting that cellular immunity is impaired. 64 Thus, measles has predisposed to Adenovirus pneumonia occurs sporadically and in epidemics, particularly in children and young adults, and occasionally complicates measles. 65, 66 Adenovirus pneumonia is usually combined with bronchiolitis and the lesions are most severe at the centres of the acini, being concentrated on the bronchioles. The virus causes necrosis of the bronchioles, many of which are totally destroyed or are recognisable only by their muscle coat: hyaline membranes replace the necrotic epithelium ( Fig. 5.1.10A ). Surviving epithelial cells show nuclear inclusions of varying staining reaction: some are diffusely basophilic or amphiphilic and fill the entire nucleus apart from a rim of chromatin (Cowdry type B) while others are eosinophilic and surrounded by a clear halo (Cowdry type A). The bronchioles are cuffed by a lymphoid infiltrate and may show proliferative epithelial activity, variously interpreted as being the result of viral stimulation or of regeneration. 54, 74 The alveolar tissue shows a mononuclear interstitial pneumonia.",

Viral inclusions are most prominent at the periphery of the ulcers and may be identified in exfoliated cells (Fig. 5.1.12 ). If they are not well developed an immunostain may establish the diagnosis. Long-standing airway infection leads to luminal narrowing and obstructive features. In the lungs the changes are very similar to those of adenovirus pneumonia, including the presence of Cowdry type B ground-glass intranuclear viral in clusions, although these are more eosinophilic than those of adenovirus. Both adenovirus and herpes simplex pneumonia bear a superficial resemblance to bacterial bronchopneumonia but the similarity is in the distribution of the lesions rather than their character: the bronchioles and centriacinar alveoli are mainly affected but the lesions are characterised by necrosis and the accumulation of nuclear debris rather than exudation of neutrophils. Occasionally herpes simplex infection takes the form of a focal necrotising pneumonia more typical of varicella infection (see below). Alternatively there may be arterial involvement in herpes simplex pneumonia with a necrotising vasculitis affecting small and medium-sized pulmonary arteries. 120 Sometimes the pneumonia is diffuse: it is suggested that focal disease represents extension of oral mucocutaneous herpesvirus infection down the tracheobronchial tree into the lung whereas diffuse pneumonia is the result of haematogenous spread. 108 ",

However, donor and recipient matching for cytomegalovirus status has reduced the incidence of transmission from the donor. Before the introduction of this policy, fatal cytomegalovirus pneumonia or systemic infection was common. Today reactivation of latent infection is a more common problem but it is important to distinguish the mere presence of viral inclusions from pneumonitis. When a lymphoid infiltrate accompanies the viral inclusions it is also important to distinguish an infective pneumonitis from lung allograft rejection: generally, the infiltrate of cytomegalovirus pneumonia lacks the perivascular lymphocyte distribution seen in rejection. As well as causing a pneumonitis that has to be distinguished from rejection, cytomegalovirus may be involved in chronic lung rejection. 122 It has been speculated that cytomegalovirus could promote allograft rejection by stimulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines or increasing the expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules.",

            "text": "The HIVs belong to the lentivirus subfamily of the retroviruses and are thought to have originated from chimpanzees, which harbour the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus. They are the cause of AIDS and are transmitted primarily through sexual contact, by anal or vaginal intercourse with an HIV-positive person. Other routes of transmission are by exposure to infected blood, generally through the use of contaminated needles and syringes by drug addicts. Infected blood products and donor tissues are other potential sources of in fection. An infected woman can pass the virus to her child in utero, at delivery or through breast-feeding. Occupational acquisition of HIV is unusual but has occurred, chiefly through needlestick injuries. In histopathology departments, particular care is required in handling unfixed tissues, as in preparing frozen sections and conducting autopsies. Fixed tissues do not present a risk of infection. Most national bodies have produced guidelines for safe laboratory practice in the AIDS era. 129 HIV infection is not always recognisable and a practical approach is therefore to treat every cadaver and all unfixed tissue as if it were infectious.",

The interferon-\u03b3-secreting Th1 cells that are central to immune defence against a variety of other infections are particularly vulnerable to attack. Once HIV infection has occurred, antibody develops, generally within a month, and after a period that is usually measured in years CD4 counts drop and manifestations of AIDS develop. Concentrations of virus in the blood and body fluids are particularly high around the time of seroconversion and when AIDS develops.",

A quarter of a century after its first recognition AIDS had killed about 25 million people and about 65 million had been infected with HIV. Many of those harbouring HIV do not know they are infected. The number of people infected with HIV is rising, because of population growth and because drug treatment is prolonging life. The epidemic is worst in sub-Saharan Africa and next the Caribbean but it is growing fastest in eastern Europe and central Asia. Worldwide, women make up about half of those infected with HIV, with the largest number in sub-Saharan Africa. Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) mortality rates have declined and life expectancy improved amongst those so treated, but these benefits have so far been largely confined to the industrialised countries.",

            "text": "Few organs escape the ravages of fully developed AIDS but the lungs are those most frequently involved in many series. 130, 131 AIDS has many pulmonary manifestations, all of which are described in detail under their relevant headings. Most are secondary to the immunodeficiency but it is possible that certain lymphocytic infiltrates reflect HIV infection of the lung. These are generally non-specific T-cell infiltrates, which are largely CD8+ and milder than those that characterise lymphoid interstitial pneumonia [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] ; HIV has been identified in the lung tissue by in situ hybridisation in a minority of cases. 135 The heavier lymphoid infiltrates of lymphoid interstitial pneumonia seen in HIV-infected children largely comprise CD8+ HIV-specific lymphocytes. Such children have fewer opportunistic infections and survive longer than other HIV-positive children, suggesting that in this setting lymphoid interstitial pneumonia reflects an effective immune response. 137 Experiments in mice suggest that viral persistence and interferon-\u03b3 production are involved. 138, 139 The commonest pulmonary manifestations of AIDS are listed in Table 5 .1.1. [140] [141] [142] [143] [144] [145] [146] [147] [148] [149] [150] Rarer pulmonary manifestations include infection by herpes simplex 118, 151 and varicella-zoster 152 viruses, Blastomyces dermatitidis, 153 Candida species, 152 cryptosporidia, 154 microsporidia 155 and Strongyloides stercoralis. 152 There is also an increased incidence of respiratory infection by common pyogenic organisms, 143, 156, 157 especially Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, 152 sometimes resulting in obliterative bronchiolitis 158 or unusual diseases such as bacterial tracheitis 159 where the trachea is narrowed by pus or necrotic material containing colonies of mixed bacteria. Tuberculosis has also made an unwelcome resurgence since the advent of AIDS. [160] [161] [162] Opportunistic mycobacterial infection, 163 malakoplakia, 164, 165 bacillary angiomatosis, 166 secondary alveolar lipoproteinosis, 167 follicular bronchitis and bronchiolitis 149 are also encountered in AIDS patients. However, there are marked geographical differences in the incidences of these manifestations of AIDS: tuberculosis is particularly common in poor countries whereas Pneumocystis, non-tuberculous mycobacteriosis and lymphoma are commoner in richer communities. Since the 1990s there has been a trend towards multiple infections, more mycobacterial disease and less Pneumocystis infection and Kaposi's sarcoma. 130, 142, 168 In most cases the secondary pulmonary infections can be diagnosed from material obtained through the fibreoptic bronchoscope (brushings, washings, lavage or biopsy) 169 or from sputum 170 but occasionally a particular pulmonary manifestation of AIDS is not revealed until open biopsy is undertaken or examination is made postmortem. There is a prominent nuclear inclusion in the centre of the field. (B) Electron micrograph of an alveolar epithelial cell infected by cytomegalovirus. Numerous viral particles are evident in both nucleus (above) and cytoplasm (below). As the viral particles leave the nucleus and enter the cytoplasm they acquire a coating derived from the nuclear envelope and consequently enlarge. (C) Low-power electron micrograph of the cell seen in (B), showing that it is greatly enlarged compared with its neighbours. Coated viral particles are evident in the cytoplasm but uncoated particles in the nucleus are too small to be recognised at this magnification. However, characteristic central clumping of the chromatin is evident. (B and C courtesy of Miss A Dewar, Brompton, UK.) (D) Immunocytochemistry shows abundant virus in the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus (immunoperoxidase stain).",

[194] [195] [196] As with the previously recognised hantaviruses, that responsible for the pulmonary syndrome is maintained in the wild in a single species of rodent, in this case the deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, which is widely distributed across North America. Like other mice they are inclined to impinge on humans in their hunt for food and there had been a marked increase in the number of deer mice in the south-west USA in 1993. Transmission of the virus is believed to be by inhalation of dried mouse excreta. Further cases have subsequently been identified in other parts of the USA and retrospective studies of archival material have shown that cases existed before 1993, the earliest in 1978. 197 The name Muerto Canyon virus was initially proposed for the hantavirus responsible for the pulmonary syndrome but this has given way to Sin Nombre virus.

That this agent is specifically concerned with the clinical disease is indicated by the rise in specific antibodies that occurs during the course of the illness. The infection, mainly in subclinical form, has become widely prevalent, as is shown by the frequency with which specific antibodies can be detected in the serum of healthy people in the general population. The clinical disease accounts for 18% of all community-acquired pneumonia requiring admission to hospital, a frequency second only to that of pneumococcal pneumonia. 203 Because the disease could be transmitted to both experimental animals and human volunteers by filtrates of sputum from cases of primary atypical pneumonia, the Eaton agent was at first regarded as a virus. Later studies indicated instead that it belongs to the group of 'pleuropneumonia-like' organisms (PPLO) -the mycoplasmas which can pass through a coarse bacterial filter. The organism is now known as Mycoplasma pneumoniae: it is one of the considerable number of mycoplasmas that have been recognised in humans, animals, plants and soil. Because of their ubiquity in rats and mice, any experiments involving the lungs of these animals are soon bedevilled by the development of bronchiectasis, pneumonia, lung abscess and empyema, unless specific pathogen-free strains are used.",

It is essentially an infection of cattle, sheep and goats that is transmitted to humans, probably more frequently than is apparent from the incidence of the disease, for many people who have never had Q fever possess circulating antibodies against C. burnetti. Among cattle, the disease is sometimes transmitted by ticks, but possibly more frequently by the inhalation of contaminated dust from the floor of milking sheds. The organisms are excreted in milk, urine and faeces, and particularly during calfing when amniotic fluid and placentae are a rich source of infection. In humans, the disease may be acquired by the inhalation of infected dust through close contact with cattle, as in dairy farms, abattoirs and hide factories, or through drinking milk that has been inadequately pasteurised. C. burnetti is resistant to drying and may survive exposure to a temperature of 60\u00b0C, an important characteristic in regard to the pasteurisation of milk.",

Men are more often symptomatic than women, despite equal seroprevalence, and there is evidence that sex hormones such as 17\u03b2-oestradiol play a protective role. 216 Pneumonia develops in only a very small proportion of those infected. In these patients, chest radiographs at the height of the disease disclose numerous relatively small, but widely distributed, opacities. The symptoms generally subside after about a week and most patients recover completely within a few months without treatment. Chronic Q fever, characterised by infection that persists for more than 6 months, is uncommon but more serious. This form of the disease may also represent a recrudescence of acute Q fever years after apparent recovery. It generally takes the form of endocarditis, usually developing in patients with pre-existent valvular heart disease, transplant recipients or those with cancer. Q fever responds to treatment with doxycycline, quinolones or macrolides.",

In these, the lungs show nodular or confluent areas of grey consolidation. The development of an inflammatory pseudotumour is recorded but is a very rare complication. 217 Microscopically, the changes in the lungs resemble those seen in viral or mycoplasmal pneumonias. There is a diffuse interstitial infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells and an alveolar exudate of fibrinous oedema fluid containing mainly macrophages and only a few neutrophils. Lymphocytic cuffing is seen about the bronchioles and small pulmonary arteries. The bronchioles contain an exudate similar to that in the alveoli and often lose their epithelial lining. Organisation of the exudates may lead to obliterative bronchiolitis and organizing pneumonia. 218 The causative organisms may be demonstrable: they usually measure about 0.25 \u00d7 0.45 \u00b5m but bacillary forms measuring up to 1.5 \u00b5m in length also occur. The organisms form microcolonies in infected cells, such as alveolar epithelium, and this facilitates their recognition in Giemsa-stained preparations. C. burnetti may also be identified in infected tissues by immunohistochemical staining and DNA detection. If the organisms are not demonstrable the changes are nonspecific and, therefore, in suspected cases, coming to necropsy, blood should be taken for serology. It should be noted that there is a real risk of pathologists and postmortem room staff contracting the disease if precautions to avoid splashing and drying of body fluids are not taken. This infectivity has raised its profile as a potential agent in bioterrorism. 219 ",

[11] [12] [13] [14] [15] This is largely due to the administration of widespectrum antibiotics. Soon after such antibacterial drugs are administered, the oral flora changes and the upper respiratory tract commonly becomes colonised by bowel organisms. 16, 17 Acid suppressants also increase the risk of nosocomial pneumonia. 18 They act by countering an important natural defence mechanism against bacterial growth in the stomach and upper small intestine. The problem has been particularly seen in intensive care units where acid suppressants may be administered to minimise the risk of gastric stress ulceration. 12 Sometimes the lungs are infected by way of the blood stream and on rare occasions an exogenous source such as a contaminated ventilator or nebuliser has been identified. 19, 20 The mechanisms involved in nosocomial pneumonia are summarised in Figure 5 Bacteriological diagnosis is usually made from the direct examination or culture of expectorated sputum. Sputum is prone to be contaminated by upper respiratory tract commensals and bronchoscopic or transcutaneous tracheal aspirates free of this problem have much Chapter 5 Acute bacterial infection of the lungs is still one of the commonest causes of death, especially in the young and the aged, but very often it is merely a terminal event secondary to some other debilitating process. Primary pneumonia is one that develops in a previously healthy individual. Whilst it is still possible to classify pneumonia on the classic basis of its lobar, bronchial (lobular) or interstitial Swallowing difficulty Vomiting to commend them. At autopsy, bacterial contamination is unavoidable and microbiological sampling of a consolidated area of lung should be through a surface sterilised by searing with a hot iron rod. A more elegant method entails the in situ culture of bacteria in the whole frozen organ using large Petri dishes. 21 By this method bacteria can be matched topographically to foci of consolidation, and contaminants recognised as being on the pleural surface of the lung.",

Local predisposing conditions include other acute infections of the respiratory tract, such as influenza, measles, pertussis and Mycoplasma infection, and chronic infective conditions such as chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis. Bronchopneumonia may also follow inhalation of irritant gases, aspiration of food or vomit, and obstruction of a bronchus by a foreign body or tumour. Bronchopneumonia is also common after surgical operations. The pathogenesis of postoperative bronchopneumonia is complex. Tracheal intubation bypasses the nose, which normally warms and moistens the inspired air, whilst ether or other irritant vapours may further impair the ciliary defence mechanism of the bronchial tree. The unconscious patient may inhale infected material from the mouth or nose, and the temporary depression of the cough reflex may allow microorganisms to establish themselves in the lungs. Once the effect of the anaesthetic has worn off, the pain associated with movement, particularly of the abdominal wall, may restrict the normal aeration of the lower parts of the lungs.

In many cases of lobar pneumonia there is a bacteraemia at the height of the infection. Acute endocarditis may then develop, and this is sometimes followed by the formation of an abscess in the brain after lodgement of an infected embolus. Pneumococcal meningitis, peritonitis and arthritis are rarer manifestations of the dissemination of the organisms by the blood but septicaemia with consequent septic shock are important complications in patients requiring hospital admission. 33 Pneumonia is the commonest cause of septic shock (Table 5.2. 3). 34, 35 Although, in patients who recover, the area of lobar consolidation usually resolves completely, several complications may interfere with the healing process. Resolution may be delayed through incomplete digestion of the fibrin in the exudate within the alveoli, and organisation, followed by fibrosis ('carnification'), may develop. The fibrosis is essentially intraluminal, taking the form of micropolypoid buds of granulation tissue (Masson bodies) that largely fill alveoli and extend into alveolar ducts and respiratory bronchioles (organising pneumonia), as described above under bronchopneumonia (see Fig. 5 ",

Soon the affected lobe becomes more crepitant as the air spaces reopen. Liquefaction of the fibrin is thought to be due to a fibrinolytic enzyme liberated from senescent neutrophils. However, excessive neutrophil breakdown would probably damage the lung and an alternative form of cell death is also utilised, namely apoptosis: The special relationship of staphylococci and influenza virus has been dealt with on page 158. In children, staphylococcal pneumonia may follow measles or whooping cough. In infants a primary staphylococcal bronchopneumonia is known, with a case fatality rate as high as 80% in the pre-antibiotic era. The infection is generally endogenous, the bacteria frequently being derived from the patient's skin or nose and the infection air-borne. However, staphylococcal pneumonia or lung abscess sometimes follows bacteraemia or septicaemia, 37 particularly in drug addicts with right-sided bacterial endocarditis. Although the mortality from most forms of pneumonia has been reduced by modern drugs, many strains of Staphylococcus now widely distributed in the population are resistant to the generally used antibiotics. Even relatively new antibiotics such as meticillin are inactive against some of these staphylococci, which have become known as meticillin-resistant S. aureus or MRSA. Such strains periodically become prevalent in hospitals, 15 carried in the nose by staff and patient, and fatalities from staphylococcal infection, often with pneumonia, have occurred among surgical patients who otherwise should have recovered from their operation. In addition, although MRSA is primarily viewed as the prototype of multiresistant nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections, new lineages have emerged that cause community-acquired infections in individuals without risk factors, including rare cases of necrotising pneumonia. [38] [39] [40] S. aureus owes its pathogenicity to a series of necrotising exotoxins that induce a marked neutrophil response resulting in suppurative tissue necrosis. 41 Particularly potent is a strain of meticillin-resistant S. aureus that secretes an exotoxin known as Panton-Valentine leukocidin. As well as complicating influenza, [42] [43] [44] this strain has resulted in fatal septic shock in previously healthy persons. 38 At necropsy, the bronchi are acutely inflamed and the lungs contain many bright yellow centrilobular foci of suppuration ( Fig. 5.2.7) , which in the more advanced cases may have enlarged and coalesced to form abscesses 1 cm or more in diameter. Adjacent air spaces contain a purulent exudate. A superficial abscess may rupture into the pleura and cause empyema, which is a common complication of staphylococcal pneumonia. If the patient survives, there may be permanent damage to the lungs in the form of pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis or large air-filled cysts known as pneumatoceles ",

The contaminated buildings are therefore generally modern, but with neglected engineering plants. Colonisation of the plant by certain free-living amoebae may also promote the growth and survival of legionellae for these bacteria are resistant to amoebic digestion and may survive exposure to disinfectants when the amoeba encysts. 63 Passers-by as well as those within the building may be infected.

A miliary distribution is another atypical manifestation. 74 Microscopically, airways do not appear to be particularly involved in the inflammatory process, so the disease is not a bronchopneumonia. An acute, leukocytoclastic, fibrinopurulent pneumonia is characteristic (Fig. 5.2.10) but sometimes macrophages are more prominent than neutrophils. The legionellae resist digestion and multiply within the phagocytes, which they eventually destroy so that intense necrosis of the inflammatory cells is often observed. At low magnifications, alveolar walls may be difficult to recognise but even when there is extensive necrosis of the exudate, close inspection, perhaps aided by reticulin stains, shows that the alveolar architecture is generally intact. Occasionally however there are breaks in the alveolar walls or more widespread destruction may be seen.

Alcoholics are also particularly susceptible to Klebsiella pneumonia, constituting about half the patients dying of Klebsiella infection. 78 Others at particular risk are the elderly and diabetics. The mortality of Klebsiella pneumonia is much higher than that of pneumococcal pneumonia: 21% in the general population and 64% in alcoholics. 78, 79 Bacteraemia is a particularly adverse prognostic factor. 78 Klebsiella pneumonia has a predilection for the upper lobes. There is often uniform diffuse consolidation but, with only part of the lobe involved, a sharply demarcated edge abutting interlobular septa rather than interlobar fissures: the part of the lobe affected by such consolidation enlarges by the progressive involvement of adjacent lobules ( Fig. 5. 2.11). The abundant mucoid coat of the klebsiellae gives the pneumonic lesions a distinctively slimy appearance and feel. This material is mucicarminophilic, a characteristic that is often helpful in identifying the infection in histological sections. Klebsiella pneumonia is particularly liable to suppurate and form lung abscesses (Fig. 5.2.12).

Adhesion of the bacteria is dependent upon the transient expression of a sialoganglioside at the apex of the regenerating epithelial cells. 83 Inhalational Pseudomonas pneumonia has also developed in patients treated by tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation due to contamination and inadequate disinfection of the ventilators. 19 Several outbreaks in the USA were attributable to faulty bronchoscopes. 84, 85 Pseudomonas pneumonia is often characterised by well-demarcated pale areas of necrosis, which histologically are composed of an amorphous coagulum containing many bacteria, the nuclear debris of necrotic neutrophils and small numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages. 86 ,87 Pseudomonas appears to be able not only to resist, but also to destroy neutrophils. 88 It is debatable whether the tissue necrosis is due to bacterial toxins or an immunological response.",

Acute and chronic forms are recognised, and, in both, lesions are commonest in the lungs.

Numerous abscesses are found throughout the body. In chest radiographs these are seen as disseminated nodules. 97 The early lesions take the form of small foci of neutrophils surrounded by haemorrhagic zones. As the abscess enlarges, fibrin becomes more prominent and necrosis ensues. Cases with prominent pulmonary features are characterised by a confluent necrotising pneumonia which has a bronchitis element that is not evident when there are only discrete abscesses. Vasculitis, a feature of P. aeruginosa pneumonia, is not seen in melioidosis. Bacilli are generally quite numerous and often form distinct collections within multinucleate macrophages that are scattered amongst the numerous neutrophils. 98 They have been shown to survive and multiply within cells, including neutrophils. 99 The bacteria are most easily identified by the Giemsa stain, which can then be supplemented by a Gram preparation. Staining is strongest at the ends of the bacilli, which therefore have a bipolar appearance that has been likened to that of a closed safety pin.",

            "text": "Woolsorter's disease was formerly seen in the Yorkshire textile towns, where it was acquired by inhalation of dust from imported wool contaminated with anthrax spores. Others at risk include those exposed to infected hides, hair, bristle, bonemeal and animal carcasses. The spores are very resistant to drying but effective measures are now directed to their destruction by exposure of imported materials to antiseptics before they are handled; as a result anthrax is now very rare in Great Britain. In 1979 there was a major epidemic of anthrax resulting in over 60 deaths in a narrow corridor of land downwind of a military establishment near Sverdlovsk, Russia, which was suspected of conducting microbiological warfare research. 105, 106 Anthrax spores were also used as a bioweapon by terrorists operating in the USA in 2001: of 11 people who were infected, 5 died. Screening procedures and plans to deal with the possibility of similar attacks have subsequently been put in place. [107] [108] [109] If inhaled, the spores are rapidly transmitted to the mediastinal lymph nodes. It is here that the bacilli form and the disease starts. From the lymph nodes the bacilli reach the blood stream and are distributed in large numbers throughout the body. The septicaemia is often so severe that the organisms are recognisable in films of the circulating blood. Although the lungs may have provided the portal of entry, they are affected secondarily as part of a systemic bloodborne disease. 110, 111 The course of inhalational anthrax is dramatic. Non-specific influenza-like symptoms rapidly progress to cardiopulmonary failure and death within a few days. 112 Necropsy shows haemorrhagic necrosis of the infected tissues. The process is most advanced in the lymph nodes draining the site of primary infection. 106 Thus, in woolsorter's disease a haemorrhagic mediastinal mass is one of the principal findings at necropsy. Other changes commonly encountered at necropsy include a large, dark, soft spleen, haemorrhagic effusions, haemorrhagic intestinal ulceration, haemorrhagic meningitis (which is often limited to the top of the cerebral hemispheres in a so-called 'cardinal's cap'), haemorrhagic bronchitis and widespread, often confluent, areas of haemorrhagic pneumonia. As in other organs, the haemorrhagic inflammatory oedema that constitutes the exudate in the alveoli contains large numbers of the characteristic large Gram-positive bacilli, which are readily seen in haematoxylin and eosin preparations. 105, 111, 113 However, immunohistochemistry is proving more reliable than Gram staining in identifying the bacteria. 108, 109 LEPTOSPIRAL PNEUMONIA Leptospirosis is a zoonosis of worldwide distribution with many wild and domestic animal reservoirs. Human infection occurs through direct contact with infected animals or, more commonly, through contact with water or soil contaminated with the urine of infected animals. Sewage workers, farmers, animal handlers and veterinarians are at particular risk. Pulmonary disease may be seen in cases of infection by leptospires of various serogroups: they are severest in cases of infection by Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae, which is acquired from rats, but have been a conspicuous feature in a small proportion of cases of canicola fever (infection by L. canicola, acquired from dogs) and of infection by L. bataviae, which occurs in parts of south-eastern Asia.",

Budgerigars are now the commonest source of ornithosis in the UK. 126 Outbreaks have also been associated with ducks, chickens and turkeys. 127, 128 Infected birds, which may show no signs of disease, excrete the organisms in droppings that eventually form a highly infected dust. It is usually through the inhalation of such dust while attending to the birds that individuals become infected, but the disease may also be contracted in poultry-processing plants or pillow-filling factories. 127 The infectivity of ornithosis is high and numerous instances have been recorded of nurses and relatives contracting the disease while caring for patients. The disease has also been acquired through exposure to the organism in the laboratory and in the performance of necropsies.",

However, the inflammatory cells are a mixture of those found in bacterial and viral pneumonia, macrophages predominating in the air spaces and a mixed lymphocytic and neutrophil infiltrate being seen in the interstitium. The changes are concentrated on the terminal bronchioles, from which they spread to involve adjacent alveoli and then the whole lobule, by which time there is often necrosis of the bronchiolar and bronchial epithelium. 129 There is engorgement and often thrombosis of capillaries that can result in foci of alveolar necrosis. Later, the alveoli develop a conspicuous lining of swollen epithelial cells. The chlamydophilae are just visible with the light microscope as cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (known as Levinthal-Coles-Lillie bodies, LCL bodies, or Levinthal bodies) that range from about 0.25 to 0.50 \u00b5m in diameter. They are to be seen in the cytoplasm of a variable proportion of the alveolar lining cells. They are basophilic and may most easily be found in preparations stained by the prolonged Giemsa method. As with many bacterial pneumonias, healing may be by repair rather than resolution, resulting in bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia. 130 C. pneumoniae pneumonia C. pneumoniae is spread from person to person rather than from birds, infecting both upper and lower respiratory tracts and causing prolonged bronchitis and mild pneumonia of rather non-specific character, somewhat similar to that caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. 125 Retrospective studies of stored sera have shown that many patients diagnosed as having psittacosis on the basis of a positive serological test were actually infected with C. pneumoniae. Antibodies to C. pneumoniae have also been identified in many persons who give no history of respiratory disease. 131 C. pneumoniae infection has a bimodal age distribution, affecting schoolchildren and the elderly. C. pneumoniae pneumonia is not fatal and there have consequently been few histopathological studies in humans. Experimental studies suggest that the bacterium causes a non-specific acute pneumonia. 125 C. pneumoniae has been linked to chronic obstructive lung disease 125, 132, 133 and an intriguing relationship between C. pneumoniae and atheroma has been identified. 124, 134, 135 ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA 136",

On occasion, however, a lung abscess has no apparent cause and is therefore termed primary. The available evidence indicates that primary lung abscesses are nearly always a consequence of the aspiration of infected oropharyngeal secretions. First, there is usually some condition predisposing to aspiration or impairing the cough reflex, for example, alcoholic stupor, general anaesthesia, head injury or neurological disease causing loss of consciousness, dysphagia or primary oesophageal dysfunction. Second, dental hygiene is usually poor, and there is often periodontitis or gingivitis. Third, primary lung abscesses are usually found in the dependent parts of the lungs. They are commoner on the right, probably because the right main bronchus is a more direct continuation of the trachea than the left, and in the apical segment of the lower lobe and the lateral parts of the basal segments of the upper lobe, these being the most dependent parts in the prone and lateral positions respectively (Figs 5.2.14, 5.2.18 and 5.2.19). 139 Fourth, the bacteria responsible are usually the mixed anaerobes that predominate in the oropharynx, particularly in people with bad teeth (Fusobacterium, Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus species), and aerobes such as Streptococcus milleri. 47, 150, 151 Thus, primary lung abscess has much in common with aspiration pneumonia and it is for this reason that it is dealt with here, rather than in Chapter 5.3, the chapter on chronic bacterial infection, which its indolent nature would justify. The bacteriology of empyema is similar to that of aspiration pneumonia and primary lung abscess but this condition is dealt with in Chapter 13, the chapter on pleural disease.",

Their comparative resistance to the normal body defences is due to an ability to inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion, permitting them to survive within the host's phagocytes. 1,2 Their resistance to ordinary stains is attributed to their cell walls being rich in mycolic acid waxes. This necessitates the use of hot concentrated carbol fuchsin for their demonstration, as in the Ziehl-Neelsen stain. Once stained in this way, they are difficult to decolorise, even with strong acids and alcohol, hence references to the acid-and alcohol-fast bacilli. Mycobacteria also show some resistance to formalin: of 138 tissue specimens from autopsy lungs fixed in formalin and showing histological evidence of acid-fast bacilli, 12 grew mycobacteria, including three Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. 3 The bacilli are normally scanty in tuberculous tissue and their identification with the Ziehl-Neelsen stain may require tedious examination of many sections. 4 They are easier to identify in rhodamineauramine-stained sections examined by fluorescence microscopy. [5] [6] [7] Tissue containing necrotising granulomas is most likely to give positive results whereas specimens showing only non-necrotising granulomas, poorly formed granulomas or acute inflammation are less likely to reveal acid-fast bacilli. 8, 9 Culture is no more likely to identify the mycobacteria than the examination of tissue sections. 9,10 Failure to demonstrate them does not exclude a diagnosis of tuberculosis. The future lies in immunohistochemistry 11 or molecular techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction, which can be adapted for application to paraffin sections. 12-15a The detection of mycobacterial RNA indicates that the bacilli are viable and is therefore preferable to tests for mycobacterial DNA. Molecular techniques are also useful in identifying drug resistance, distinguishing mycobacterial species and identifying specific strains of M. tuberculosis. [16] [17] [18] The mycobacteria that cause tuberculosis in humans are sometimes listed as M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. africanum and M. microti, the socalled tuberculosis complex, although these four organisms are probably just variants of a single species. The first two correspond to the human and bovine tubercle bacilli while M. africanum includes a heterogeneous group of strains, with properties intermediate between the former two, isolated from humans in equatorial Africa and from African immigrants in Europe. The features and management of tuberculosis in humans caused by these three variants are very similar. M. microti, the vole tubercle bacillus, is of attenuated pathogenicity for humans and has been used as a vaccine.",

Today, there is little doubt that when the lesions are present in the lungs the infection has taken place as a result of inhalation of tubercle bacilli. That the respiratory tract should be the chief portal of entry is scarcely surprising in view of the great preponderance of the pulmonary form of chronic tuberculosis in humans and of the enormous numbers of tubercle bacilli that are eliminated daily in the sputum of most untreated active cases. Those in close contact with such patients are liable to inhale the bacilli and acquire the infection in their lungs. Although the smaller droplets of expectorated sputum, which may remain for many minutes suspended in the air after a cough, are probably the chief vehicle for the transmission of tubercle bacilli, it should be realised that the organisms are resistant to desiccation, and that in consequence, dried 'droplet nuclei', or the dust that they ultimately contaminate, may long remain as potential carriers of the infection. Tuberculosis transmission can be reduced however by hospitalising patients with positive sputa in isolation rooms equipped with ultraviolet light and exhaust ventilation. 19 The decline in mortality, temporarily checked by two world wars, was established well before specific chemotherapy became available, and is largely attributable to improved living standards. 160 180 1900 1905 1910 1915 1920 1925 1930 1935 1940 1945 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 Other routes of infection which may have operated in pulmonary mycobacteriosis in the past include haematogenous dissemination from a primary focus of M. bovis infection in the intestine, acquired by drinking infected milk, and similar spread from a primary focus in the skin acquired by traumatic inoculation (a rare occupational hazard of pathologists and butchers, hence the old term 'butcher's wart'), but these have never been as important as droplet spread.",

During almost the whole of this period an amelioration in social conditions took place in an almost uninterrupted, unspectacular manner and it is to these unspecific factors that for many years the progressive fall in mortality was essentially due, although it was aided by public health measures such as the eradication of tuberculous cattle and mass radiography screening. After 1950, the decline in mortality from tuberculosis was hastened by the introduction of effective antituberculosis drugs. By bringing about a great fall in the number -often even the complete disappearance -of bacilli in the sputum in cases of active respiratory tuberculosis, these drugs have much reduced the hazard of infection that was formerly incurred by those who inadvertently or by obligatory associations were brought into contact, at work or at home, with an infectious case of the disease.",

The situation is similar in many other developed countries. Tuberculosis can therefore be regarded once more as a worldwide problem. It is estimated that about one-third of the world's population (approximately 2000 million people) have latent tuberculosis while the prevalence of active disease is put at more than 20 million worldwide.

In 2007, there were an estimated 1.37 million new cases of tuberculosis among HIV-infected people and 456 000 deaths, one in four deaths from tuberculosis being HIVrelated. 34 In sub-Saharan Africa, the AIDS epidemic is having a devastating effect on tuberculosis control programmes, with up to 100% increases in reported tuberculosis cases. The annual risk of active tuberculosis in those who are doubly infected is 10%, compared with a 10% lifetime risk in those who harbour the tubercle bacillus but are HIV-negative. 35 The situation in richer countries may not be so bad because HIV-infected persons tend to be young and those harbouring tuberculosis old, rendering recrudescence unlikely. 35 However, within HIV units, cross-infection is being reported. 31 Such nosocomial transmission has involved patients and hospital staff who are immunocompetent as well as other HIV-positive patients. 36 The mechanism whereby HIV infection promotes tuberculosis is probably related to the pattern of cytokines produced by T-lymphocyte subsets. T-helper-1 lymphocytes produce interferon-\u03b3 and are central to antimycobacterial immune defence. However, when peripheral blood lymphocytes from HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis are exposed to tubercle bacilli in vitro they produce less interferon-\u03b3 than lymphocytes from HIV-negative patients with tuberculosis, suggesting that a reduced T-helper-1 response contributes to HIV-infected patients' susceptibility to tuberculosis. 37 It is also noteworthy that there is a reciprocal relationship between tuberculosis and HIV infection: tuberculosis appears to promote the course of HIV infection, probably by inducing macrophages to secrete cytokines that increase HIV replication. [38] [39] [40] Not surprisingly in view of the interrelationship of HIV and the tubercle bacillus, the tuberculosis associated with HIV infection is particularly aggressive, being characterised by widespread dissemination throughout the body and a poor host response. 41 This nonreactive form of tuberculosis is similar to the insidious disease of elderly patients referred to above and described on page 210.",

Further experience has shown that it is not so much the youth of these patients as the fact that they are infected for the first time that accounts for the distinctive structural features of their lesions. In consequence, this form of tuberculosis is now known as the 'primary type', and as the incidence of the disease in the general population has declined and the age of first infection has correspondingly risen, it is now met with increasing frequency in adults. The second morphological form -previously known as the 'adult type' of the disease -occurs in those patients who have been sensitised by an earlier exposure to tuberculosis: this type of disease is now generally termed 'postprimary tuberculosis' . Postprimary tuberculosis is due to either fresh infection or reactivation of a dormant primary lesion (Fig.  5.3.2) . Reinfection is common in countries in which tuberculosis is prevalent but in the developed countries reactivation of infection acquired decades earlier is commoner.

This localised collection of epithelioid macrophages, Langhans giant cells and lymphocytes constitutes a tuberculous granuloma (Fig. 5.3.3) . Immunocytochemistry shows that the lymphocytes in the inner zone of the granuloma are mainly T-helper (CD4) and memory (CD45RO) cells whereas the outer zone includes both CD4 and CD8 (T-suppressor) lymphocytes, while immediately adjacent to the outer zone and difficult to distinguish from it without immunocyto chemistry there is a secondary centre composed of B lymphocytes and active (Ki-67+) antigen-presenting cells (Fig. 5.3.4) . 45 By the third week, the granuloma has usually grown sufficiently to be visible to the naked eye as a small, grey nodule, or tubercle, which gives the disease its name. As the tubercle enlarges, its centre turns yellow. Microscopical examination at this stage shows that the granuloma has undergone necrosis (Fig. 5.3.5) . A ring of satellite tubercles then develops and as these undergo central necrosis they fuse together (Fig. 5.3.6 ). In this way the original granuloma gradually increases in size. The growth of a tuberculous lesion by the progressive development and subsequent incorporation of satellite tubercles is also seen in postprimary tuberculosis (see Fig. 5.3.19, p. 210) .",

Gradually, during the weeks following the institution of the treatment the finely dispersed opacities can be seen to regress until their presence is no longer detectable radiologically. At this stage, microscopical examination of the tubercle shows merely a minute scar composed almost wholly of hyaline collagen with no trace of the former distinctive cellular structure. If a cure follows at a more advanced stage of the disease, after caseation has occurred, the caseous material becomes calcified. This results in a fine mottling of the lung fields that may be seen radiologically for years after. successful therapeutically but von Pirquet used Koch's 'old tuberculin' as a skin-testing agent after showing that reactivity to it indicates that a person has been infected by the tubercle bacillus. In the original test, a drop of old tuberculin was placed on the skin and a scratch was made through the drop, but reagents are now administered by intradermal injection (the Mantoux method) or by use of multiple-pronged devices (Heaf and tine tests). Old tuberculin has given way to purified protein derivative but the principle of the test remains unchanged and it provides a useful indication of the extent of transmission of tuberculosis in countries where tuberculin reactivity has not been artificially induced by bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination (see below) or there is not heavy exposure to the opportunistic environmental mycobacteria. To circumvent the problem of opportunistic mycobacteria causing such spurious reactions, blood tests have been developed that measure T-cell interferon release in vitro in response to antigens unique to the tubercle bacillus. 56 The tuberculin skin test becomes positive within a few weeks of tuberculous infection being acquired and remains so in the great majority for many years. Confidence in the reliability and specificity of the test is based mainly upon evidence from two sources. The first comes from surveys made on cattle just before slaughter: the result of the test correlated very closely with the presence or absence of tuberculous lesions in the carcass. The second is derived from tests on clinically tuberculous and clinically non-tuberculous children under 5 years of age: 94% of the former, and only 12% of the latter, were positive.",

The most significant conclusion from their work was that, unlike what had been found for many other infectious diseases, killed organisms were relatively impotent as immunising agents. Protection could be conferred only through an infection that had been overcome. In consequence of this, the search for an effective prophylactic agent became one for strains of the bacillus that were of such low natural virulence, or that had been so attenuated by appropriate methods of culture, that they could be inoculated safely while still alive. Such strains, it was hoped, would produce only a self-limiting infection. Of those that have been found, the organism now widely known, after those who developed it, as bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin or BCG has established itself as the agent of choice, and is now widely employed in antituberculosis schemes in many parts of the world. Yet, although the effectiveness of BCG has been demonstrated on many occasions (Table 5. 3.4), in other studies it appears to have conferred no protection whatsoever. 58 The reason for these marked differences is poorly understood but may be connected with the fact that, since its introduction, numerous daughter strains of varying antigenicity have developed, which is not surprising as being a live bacterium it has had to be passaged in vitro over 1000 times. 59 Another possible reason is the variable prevalence of other mycobacteria in the environment as these confer some protection against tuberculosis but also reduce the effectiveness of BCG. 59a Table 5 .3.4 shows that BCG is most effective when administered soon after birth, i.e. to the immunologically na\u00efve. In developing countries, where the prevalence of tuberculosis is high, BCG immunisation of the newborn is recommended to prevent the dangerous forms of childhood tuberculosis, but elsewhere it is only recommended for the Mantoux-negative members of certain high-risk groups -health workers, including mortuary and laboratory staff, veterinarians, case contacts, immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis together with their children and infants wherever born, and those intending to stay in Asia, Africa or Central or South America for longer than a month.",

Cytotoxic (CD8-positive) T cells are activated by products of the class I major histocompatibility genes (HLA-A and -B), which are expressed on the surface of antigenpresenting cells if microbial proliferation proceeds unchecked within phagocytes, the bacteria-containing phagocytes then being eliminated by the T cells. On the other hand, effective processing of the bacteria results in the antigen-presenting cells expressing class II major histocompatibility genes (HLA-D), the products of which activate (CD4positive) T-helper cells, so enhancing bacterial elimination. 68 Two types of T-helper cells are recognised, one concerned mainly in immunity and the other with hypersensitivity. Type 1 T-helper lymphocytes (Th1) secrete interleukin-2 and the macrophageactivating cytokine interferon-\u03b3, resulting in enhanced bacterial elimination; however, it also results in the secretion of tumour necrosis factor by the macrophage, which contributes to the hypersensitivity that derives from the activation of type 2 helper T cells (Th2). 69 Th2 cells secrete interleukins-4, -5, -6 and -10, which prime tissue cells to the necrotising action of tumour necrosis factor secreted by macrophages activated by Th1 cells. Thus, type 1 reactions are essentially protective but also contribute to the type 2 cell-mediated hypersensitivity (Fig. 5.3.13) . 43, 44, 68, 70 Many chronic infections are first characterised by a Th1 response which then shifts to a Th2 response, with detriment to the host.

Just deep to this is a zone of granulation tissue containing a profusion of macrophages and lymphocytes and occasional multinucleate giant cells. If the cavity has been infected secondarily by other organisms, as often happens, this zone may also contain many neutrophils. Outside this zone there is generally a mantle of satellite tubercles. Still deeper in the wall are traces of residual parenchyma, often with alveoli obliterated by compression and fibrosis. The cavities enlarge by incorporation of the satellite tubercles, more of which are constantly forming more peripherally (see Fig. 5.3.19 ). In this way tuberculous granulation tissue extends into the surrounding lung substance as its lining progressively caseates, liquefies and is expectorated. Eventually the process of cavitation may reach the pleura, but perforation into the sac hardly ever takes place, for the chronic pleurisy that accompanies the changes within the lungs results in the formation of firm adhesions between the visceral and parietal layers, with obliteration of the pleural sac.",

Occasionally, however, especially when resistance is low, several of these environmental mycobacteria cause serious disease. 92, 93 Their distinction from M. tuberculosis is important because they require special drug regimens; they do not respond to antituberculosis treatment. Formerly dismissed as 'atypical' or 'anonymous', these species are better described as the opportunistic mycobacteria. They include M. marinum and M. ulcerans, the causes of swimming-pool granuloma and Buruli ulcer respectively, and a group that causes disease that is very like tuberculosis. In infection by members of the latter group, as in tuberculosis itself, the lungs are the organs most often involved and there may be spread to lymph nodes, bone, meninges, kidneys and elsewhere, or massive dissemination throughout the body akin to miliary tuberculosis. The similarity to tuberculosis is also seen in that the gastrointestinal tract is another important portal of entry. 94 The commonest opportunistic mycobacteria infecting the lungs are Infection with these organisms comes from the environment, in contrast to tuberculosis, which is always transmitted from an infected individual. The infection rate of tuberculosis in the community bears a direct relation to the number of infectious cases but this is not the case with the opportunistic mycobacteria. The prevalence of opportunistic mycobacterial infection in a community is independent of that of tuberculosis and is not controlled by public health measures aimed at reducing the spread of tuberculosis.",

Local factors include pneumoconiosis, chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis and old tuberculosis. The virulence of mycobacteria is enhanced by lipid 101 and the growth of opportunistic mycobacteria, especially M. fortuitumchelonei, appears to be promoted by lipid pneumonia. [102] [103] [104] The aspiration of milk may explain an observed association between achalasia and M. fortuitum-chelonei infection. 105, 106 Only rarely is no predisposing cause recognised. 107, 108 Although some impairment of host defence is generally necessary for these bacteria to establish themselves in humans, heavy exposure may result in healthy individuals being infected. An example of this is the increasingly frequent presentation in affluent, non-immunocompromised individuals of diffuse lung disease due to the inhalation of aerosols from hot tubs and showers heavily infected by these bacteria. However, there are suggestions that this may represent extrinsic allergic alveolitis rather than infection. 96, [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] Despite the above, there appears to be an increasing incidence of infection by opportunistic mycobacteria in persons who are not obviously immunodeficient or heavily exposed. These individuals are often women and it has been suggested that their infection may be due to them suppressing their cough reflex for reasons of societal etiquette, an unlikely scenario but one that has nevertheless entered the medical argot as the Lady Windermere syndrome, a term taken from the fastidious character of the same name in Oscar Wilde's play Lady Windermere's Fan. 115 A survey of such patients found that they were taller and leaner than controls, had high rates of scoliosis, pectus excavatum, mitral valve prolapse and mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. This categorised the condition as one of women with a complex pre-existing morphotype, suggesting that there was an underlying genetic defect. 116",

Chronic melioidosis is acquired in the same way as the acute form and may represent persistence or recrudescence of acute disease or arise insidiously in someone unknown to have had acute disease. The disease progresses gradually over months or years. It takes the form of localised lesions that may affect any organ but most commonly involve the lungs, where chronic cavitatory melioidosis may closely mimic tuberculosis apart from relative sparing of the apices. [136] [137] [138] Pleural effusion and empyema are less common in chronic than acute disease. Before cavitation takes place, microscopy shows areas of necrosis surrounded by granulomatous inflammation. The central necrotic zones are often stellate, and may be suppurative or caseous. The surrounding granulomatous reaction consists of epithelioid and Langhans giant cells and is itself encompassed by a fibrous mantle. When necrosis is suppurative, the histological features mimic those of cat scratch disease or lymphogranuloma venereum, and, especially in the lungs, tularaemia (see p. 187) or sporotrichosis (see p. 244). When the necrosis is caseous, the histological picture is very similar to that of tuberculosis. In contrast to the acute form of the disease, the causative bacterium (Burkholderia pseudomallei) can be difficult to demonstrate in tissue sections (see p. 186 for staining methods). The diagnosis is then largely dependent upon serological techniques.",

It will be difficult to correct this misconception, particularly in view of such entrenched nosological nomenclature as actinomycosis, which by virtue of the ending '-mycosis' -its etymology is usually misinterpreted -is unlikely to be displaced from its common association with the true mycoses, in spite of other well-understood terminological paradoxes and pitfalls such as mycosis fungoides and mycotic aneurysm.

About 25% of cases of actinomycosis involve the ileocaecal region and in the remaining 15% of cases the infection is in the lungs. It is presumed that pulmonary actinomycosis is the outcome of aspiration of infected matter from the tonsillar crypts or mouth, apart from the very small proportion of cases in which the disease has extended from known foci of infection in the abdomen. The diagnosis should therefore be particularly suspected in patients with dental caries or a history of unconsciousness with aspiration.

Contrary to a common belief, 'sulphur granules' -the yellow colonial granules of the organisms -are not often to be found in the sputum. Haemoptysis is a significant complication and may require surgical treatment. 144 The diagnosis depends on recognition of the fine, Grampositive, sometimes branching filaments in films, and isolation of the organism. It has to be remembered that the organism may be present in sputum only in short bacillary forms that are liable to be misinterpreted. The chest radiograph may show opacities of various sizes scattered through both lungs, particularly in the middle and lower zones. Alternatively, there may be a large pneumonic area, sometimes associated with an empyema: this type of disease may be accompanied by new bone formation on the inner aspects of several contiguous ribs due to elevation of the periosteum by the inflammatory infiltrate. Occasionally, infiltration of the chest wall suggests malignancy (Fig.  5.3.24) . The presence of discharging sinuses on the chest wall is characteristic of advanced thoracic actinomycosis 145 but this stage is seldom encountered today. 146, 147 It is in the pus discharging from these sinuses that the 'sulphur granules' referred to above are to be found. Recent series have been characterised by less specific features that have suggested tuberculosis or cancer. 140, 141, 148 The diagnosis has often been made only after lung tissue has been resected, but may be possible by biopsy, particularly when the process involves major airways. 141,149 It should be confirmed by culture and, because A. israelii is a strict anaerobe and will die on exposure to atmospheric oxygen, prompt delivery to the laboratory for appropriate processing is imperative.",

The organisms are present in the exudate, and may be very numerous. Their number is often only inadequately disclosed by Gram or Ziehl-Neelsen stains: the Grocott-Gomori method is generally more reliable (Fig. 5.3.26) . 165 Healing may result in extensive organising pneumonia. 166 Rarely, pulmonary nocardiosis may take the form of an intracavitary nocardioma 167 or invade contiguous vertebrae and compress the spinal cord. 168 N. asteroides has a particular affinity for the central nervous system; nocardial brain abscess and nocardial meningitis are frequent complications of pulmonary infection.

Its natural habitat is the soil and its transmission is aerogenous. It is best known as a pathogen in foals, cattle, swine and sheep, where it is a lethal cause of suppurative granulomatous pneumonia, lymphadenitis, mediastinitis and pyometra. It has only recently been recognised as pathogenic to humans. Human infection often follows exposure to farm animals or to stockyards contaminated with animal excreta. Virtually all Rhodococcus-infected patients have been severely immunocompromised, typically suffering from AIDS, of which it is an infrequent complication. 169 The clinical presentation is often insidious, consisting of fatigue, fever and a non-productive cough. The eosinophilic mantle is known as the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon, although neither of these workers recognised its true nature. Splendore described the eosinophilic material around Sporotrichum in 1908 and erroneously assumed that it was a new species, while Hoeppli described the same material around schistosomes in 1932 and erroneously suggested that it was secreted by the parasite. The material is now considered to consist of immunoglobulin, complement and cellular debris. It is especially striking in actinomycosis, botryomycosis and various fungal infections, but may also be seen around parasites such as schistosomes and helminths, and even around foreign material.",

None of these is part of the normal human flora. They are soil saprophytes that are often found in decaying organic matter and human infection is exogenous. Nocardia were first identified in cattle suffering from farcy in 1888. 150 Human disease was described shortly afterwards. 151, 152 In contrast to A. israelii, N. asteroides is an aerobic bacterium. It is formed of filaments measuring 0.5-1.0 \u00b5m in width, which are so highly branched that they have been likened to Chinese characters. They often break into bacillus-like fragments during preparation of films of infected exudate. They are Gram-positive but often weakly so, and although commonly acid-fast, they are seldom as strongly so as tubercle bacilli and they are not alcohol-fast; silver impregnation methods offer the best means of demonstrating this organism in tissue sections. In contrast to A. israelii, and to N. brasiliensis and N. caviae, in the lungs Rhodococcus equi (formerly Corynebacterium equi) is generally involved, although rare cases associated with other infections are described. 184 Rhodococci are Gram-positive coccobacilli that may be mistaken for commensal diphtheroids in sputum. They are sometimes acid-fast. R. equi has been recognised as an agent causing bronchopneumonia in horses and other domesticated animals since its first isolation from infected foals in 1923. Its habitat is the soil. Infection of both humans and beasts is thought to be acquired through the lungs. Human infection almost always involves patients who have defects in cell-mediated immunity.

Other fungi invade the tissues only because of lowering of the patient's resistance by some other disease or as a side-effect of treatment. Some of the fungi that cause these so-called opportunistic infections are seldom, if ever, responsible for illness in healthy individuals: this is particularly so of mucormycetes. Others cause disease in healthy individuals of a type very different from the progressive, destructive, disseminated infection that they set up in those whose resistance has been reduced: asthma from sensitisation to aspergilli and saprophytic growth in previously formed cavities are examples of such disease. Many fungi that infect humans are dimorphic -that is, they grow as yeast-like organisms at certain temperatures and in mycelial form at others. Sporulating conidiophores (or 'fruiting heads') form on the mycelial hyphae when oxygen is plentiful and release spores into the atmosphere. The spores are particularly likely to be inhaled and germinate into hyphae in the lungs. The size and shape of the fungus in its various forms often enable the histopathologist to identify the genus (Box 5.4.1) but speciation generally requires culture.",

The pellicle is particularly thick at one point, a feature that is evident by light microscopy in silver-stained preparations as a peripheral dot on the cyst wall. The pellicle is triple-layered, consisting of an outer electron-dense zone about 75 nm thick, an electron-lucent intermediate zone 250 nm thick and an inner 7-nm membrane. Numerous small tubular structures are associated with the inner layer. Up to eight nucleated intracystic bodies or sporozoa are also probably derived from this membrane. These are released when the cyst ruptures (Fig. 5.4.2) . Collapsed cysts are largely empty and the innermost membrane of the wall is either detached or absent. The released sporozoa grow from about 1.5 to 6 \u00b5m, have a thin pellicle and are highly irregular in shape (Fig. 5.4.3) . They are now known as trophozoites and possibly undergo binary fission before entering a precyst stage in which their pellicles thicken (Fig. 5.4.4) .",

Rarely, the disease takes the form of solid or cavitating pulmonary nodules. 29, 30 Histological appearances Microscopically, the alveoli are filled by a foamy, pale, eosinophilic exudate (Fig. 5.4.6) . The parasite is unstained in haematoxylin and eosin preparations but with Grocott's methenamine silver stain the alveoli are seen to contain numerous round cysts that measure about 5 \u00b5m across. Crescent-shaped forms (Fig. 5.4.7) represent collapsed cysts and their presence is helpful if there is concern that erythrocytes have not been successfully differentiated in the staining procedure, especially if bronchial washings or bronchoalveolar lavage fluids are being examined and the topographical features provided by a biopsy cannot be studied. Another helpful feature is a dot, generally seen on the edge of the cyst (see Fig. 5.4.7) ; this represents a focal thickening of cyst wall. 31 Various quick modifications of fixation and processing and of the Grocott stain have been introduced to speed the diagnosis, 32-34 but the importance of fixation in killing any concomitant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) should not be overlooked. Other special stains that find favour include the Gram Weigert and Giemsa methods 35, 36 and those using monoclonal antibodies (Fig.  5.4.8) . 22 The last two methods stain the trophozoite as well as the encysted form of the parasite, but as the cysts are invariably present in Pneumocystis pneumonia (and are shown by Grocott's stain), this is a dubious advantage: the Grocott stain is clearer and has the advantage of staining any other fungi that may also be present. 37 However, in sputa and other cytological specimens where the pneumocysts may be sparse the greater sensitivity of immunochemical stains and molecular techniques is advantageous. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] In situ hybridisation has also been used to demonstrate pneumocysts in tissue sections. 38 litis. 30 The invasion of the interstitium and pulmonary blood vessels probably causes the necrosis that underlies the cavitating nodules. 30, 53, 54 The cavities develop into air cysts, which are prone to rupture into the pleural cavities, resulting in both pneumo thorax and Pneumocystis infection of the pleura. 55, 56 Alternatively, there may be interstitial spread and infection of the pleural cavities in the absence of any direct fistulous communication. 52 In view of the vascular invasion it is not surprising that widespread blood-borne dissemination is also reported, particularly in AIDS. 15, 39, [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] The fact that this sometimes develops in the absence of obvious pneumonia has been attributed to the prophylactic use of inhaled pentamidine which reduces the risk of Pneumocystis pneumonia but does not prevent the organism spreading to other organs. Restitution of the immune response following effective antiviral therapy is sometimes accompanied by an 'immune reaction inflammation syndrome' (IRIS) 62 and this may ultimately result in widespread interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.",

Although the periodic acid-Schiff stain and the Gridley stain for fungi facilitate their recognition, the Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver nitrate method is very much more reliable. The hyphae are septate and their hyphal diameter, which varies from 3 to 6 \u00b5m, is fairly regular. Typically, the hyphae branch dichotomously at relatively narrow angles (35-45\u00b0), the branches then tending to orient themselves parallel to each other. Rare fungi of similar morphology, such as The alveolar exudate in which the parasites are found is virtually free of host cells except for a mild increase in the number of alveolar macrophages.

In some cases local tissue injury and even generalised acute oxalosis and renal failure have resulted from the production of oxalic acid by the fungus. 68, 69 Its widespread deposition as insoluble calcium oxalate may be accompanied by sudden hypocalcaemia. 70 Tissue toxicity is attributed to calcium oxalate complexing with iron, resulting in the production of free oxidants. 71 Oxalosis is commonest with saprophytic aspergillosis but is also recorded with the allergic and invasive varieties of the infection (described below). The demonstration of oxalate crystals in biopsy and cytology specimens can be a useful aid in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis. [72] [73] [74] The crystals are birefringent (Fig. 5.4.15 ), stain with alizirin red 75 and can be confirmed as oxalate by crystallography and X-ray diffraction. 76 Predisposing causes and types of pulmonary aspergillosis 77, 78 Although exposure to Aspergillus spores is common, the fungus is not a frequent pathogen. Only if the individual is atopic, or the lungs have been previously damaged, or general resistance is lowered by other conditions are ill-effects likely to occur. Bronchopulmonary disease caused by aspergilli may accordingly be classified respectively as allergic, saprophytic and invasive. 77, 79 Rarely, different forms of pulmonary aspergillosis occur in the same patient. For example, an aspergilloma may be complicated by allergic aspergillosis, 80,81 even in a non-atopic patient, whilst an aspergilloma may develop within the bronchiectasis resulting from allergic aspergillosis. 82, 83 ",

Furthermore, as the disease is a hypersensitivity phenomenon, hyphae are very sparse and have to be searched for diligently, in contrast to both the other main forms of aspergillosis (saprophytic and invasive) in which hyphae are numerous.",

Circulating precipitating antibodies to Aspergillus antigens may be demonstrable and immunoglobulin E, both total and specific, is generally raised; indeed, these immunological tests, together with the demonstration of immediate (and late) skin reactions to Aspergillus antigens, are now the main means of confirming the clinical diagnosis of allergic aspergillosis. There is, however, a wide range of specific antibodies to various antigenic components of the fungus, and con- centration of the serum may be necessary to detect them for they are often not present in the high concentrations found in association with an aspergilloma. Poor antigens may give false-negative results and corticosteroids may depress the antibody response and thus both skin and serological reactions. Culture of the sputum is not always positive and on occasion the diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is first made by the histopathologist after surgery has been undertaken for a suspected malignancy (Fig. 5.4.16 and see Fig. 9 .8, p. 464). 89 The term 'allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis' is generally limited to a syndrome that is chiefly characterised by the expectoration of mucous plugs or the impaction of such plugs and the consequent development of bronchiectasis. However, allergy to Aspergillus may have further bronchopulmonary consequences, notably bronchocentric granulomatosis and eosinophilic pneumonia, both of which are dealt with elsewhere (see pp. 461 and 464). Attention here will be limited to mucoid impaction.",

[135] [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] In this form of invasive aspergillosis the airways are occluded by a mixture of necrotic debris and fungal hyphae (Fig. 5.4.24 ). It may be preceded by the obstructive form of saprophytic aspergillosis, described above. A granulomatous response to the fungus may develop, mimicking bronchocentric granulomatosis. 141, 142 MUCORMYCOSIS Mycology Mucormycosis (formerly zygomycosis or phycomycosis) is the name most widely familiar for any infection caused by a fungus that is a member of the class Zygomycetes (formerly Phycomycetes). This class includes the orders Mucorales and Entomophthorales. They are found in soil, dung and dust throughout the world and are common causes of food spoilage. The classic form of mucormycosis is rhinocerebral, where the fungi grow from an infected ulcer in the nasal space to invade the cranial cavity, cerebral blood vessels and the contents of one or both orbits. 143, 144 Some of the mucormycoses are primary subcutaneous or orificial mucosal infections, occurring without predisposing disease. Very rarely, dissemination of the fungus from these primary sites results in visceral infection, including pulmonary mucormycosis due to the Entomophthorales Basidiobolus haptosporus (B. meristosporus) and Conidiobolus coronatus (Entomophthora coronata). Much more commonly, pulmonary mucormycosis is direct and attributable to lowering of resistance to invasion of the tissues by Mucorales of the species Absidia, Mucor and Rhizopus which ordinarily are sapro-phytes on decaying organic matter. It is quite exceptional for one of these moulds to set up progressive infection in a patient who is otherwise in good health. 145 The Mucorales that cause pulmonary infection are recognisable as such in histological sections by their characteristic morphology (Fig.  5.4 .25A) but this does not allow identification of genus or species, which requires immunohistochemistry. 66 The hyphae are characteristically of variable but generally broad diameter, ranging from 3 to 20 \u00b5m. They tend to branch perpendicularly, and septation of the hyphae is absent or at most very infrequent. A false impression of septum formation may be given by folds that result from shrinkage. Because of their irregular appearance and the sometimes striking effects of shrinkage during histological processing the hyphae have been likened to lengths of crushed ribbon. Although visible in haematoxylin and eosin preparations, the mucoraceous fungi are best shown by special methods: the methenamine silver stain is often useful, but better results may be obtained by the silver impregnation methods used in the demonstration of reticulin fibres. As in the case of aspergilli, such morphologically specific structures as sporangiophores develop only when the mould is growing in air: they are seldom, if ever, seen in pulmonary lesions in the fresh state, but they may form if a specimen has inadvertently been left exposed before being placed in fixative solution. Culture often fails and histology may then be the first means of identification, supplemented if required by molecular techniques. 67 The distinction from aspergilli is important because the treatment differs.",

The primary pulmonary lesion of cryptococcosis is comparable to the initial lesion of histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis and to the Ghon focus of tuberculosis. Other diseases predisposing to secondary pulmonary cryptococcosis include alveolar lipoproteinosis and AIDS. 119, 155, 156 Cryptococcal inflammatory pseudotumours are recorded in HIVpositive patients. 157 C. neoformans is a spheroidal or ovoid organism (Fig. 5.4.27) . A characteristic feature is variability in size, the cell body measuring from 3 to 20 \u00b5m in diameter, although in many instances it is within the range of 6-9 \u00b5m. Another prominent feature is single, narrowbased budding, as opposed to the single, broad-based budding of Blastomyces dermatitidis and the multiple narrow-based budding of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Fig. 5.4.27A) . The organism has a mucoid capsule that usually stains with mucicarmine, a reaction that is not given by any other pathogenic yeast-like fungus. Cryptococci can be seen in haematoxylin and eosin preparations because they are refractile and, in polarised light, birefringent. They can also be demonstrated by any of the special methods for staining fungi (Fig. 5.4.27B) . The capsule is sometimes deficient, in which case the fungus is not mucicarminophilic. 158 However, in most cases of capsule-deficient cryptococcosis some carminophilic capsular material can be identified around a few yeasts. A Masson-Fontana stain can also help in the recognition of capsule-deficient cryptococci because, unlike other yeasts, cryptococci produce a melanin-like pigment. 159 Alternatively, capsule-deficient strains may be identified by immunohistochemistry.",

In dry films the fungal cells disintegrate or become smudged and usually cannot be recognised, although sometimes staining with mucicarmine is conclusive. Cultures are generally the preferred means of confirming the diagnosis, but some strains of the cryptococcus do not grow well and several attempts may have to be made before the organism is isolated.

Less rarely, there are one or more focal lesions in the lungs, up to several centimetres in diameter, that prove to be foci of progressive cryptococcal infection. These are known as cryptococcomas (formerly torulomas) (Fig. 5.4.27C) . They are firm, pale tan and rather sharply defined but are encapsulated only when healing. Their cut surface may be dry or gelatinous: the latter is the case when there is less inflammatory reaction to the organisms, which, packed closely in great numbers, account for the mucoid appearance and consistence of such lesions. Cryptococcal inflammatory pseudotumours are solid, firm and grey. Progressive cavitary disease occurs in about 10% of cases. Confluence and continuing enlargement of multiple foci may produce a gelatinous pneumonia involving a segment or the greater part of one or more lobes. In cases of generalised haematogenous dissemination of cryptococcosis both lungs may be studded with miliary or larger foci: close inspection of these discloses their gelatinous nature; they tend to be sharper in outline than miliary tubercles or pyaemic abscesses.

It is an unfortunate name, for such cases may occur singly when individuals are so unfortunate as to stir up large numbers of spores when working alone in a contaminated environment. These outbreaks have occurred when infected dust is disturbed in the course of cleaning or demolishing buildings, ranging from hen houses to city halls, that have harboured birds that over years have left the droppings that so perfectly favour the growth of the saprophytic phase of H. capsulatum. Similarly, those who enter caves where bat and bird droppings have encouraged the Histoplasma to proliferate may suffer comparable group outbreaks of acute histoplasmic pneumonia. The multiple foci of histoplasmosis that form in the lungs of heavily infected patients have the same structure and run the same course as the solitary primary foci described above. However, in some cases the infection is so heavy, and the resulting changes in the lungs are so widespread, that death occurs. Those who have not previously had a histoplasmic infection tend to suffer the severest illness in these outbreaks, but even those already known to have had a primary infection may develop fatal pneumonic lesions under such conditions of massive reinfection. Fatal opportunistic Histoplasma pneumonia is recorded 168 but immunosuppression is by no means necessary.",

The maturing spherule is usually accompanied by a histiocytic reaction, with the formation of many multinucleate giant cells: the parasite may be enclosed by the latter or lie free in the tissues. The mature spherule attracts neutrophils, which collect to form microabscesses at the centre of the histiocytic granulomatous foci. When the spherule ruptures, the freshly released spores, which range from 5 to 10 \u00b5m in diameter, at first lie free in the purulent exudate but soon are engulfed by mononucleate or multinucleate macrophages. They grow, and eventually become transformed into further spherules, thus repeating the cycle and leading to extension of the infection. The fungal cells are usually well seen in haematoxylin and eosin preparations, except in the early stages when only a few, newly released spores are present, which may be so inconspicuous as to escape detection. The methenamine silver and other stains for fungi demonstrate all forms of the organism very clearly.

Primary infection occurs in childhood and generally heals spontaneously. The sexes are affected equally in childhood but the development of the yeasts is inhibited by oestrogens and in adults the disease is largely limited to male agricultural workers. It is also described in patients with AIDS. 191 Disseminated disease tends to be acute and generalised in children and chronic and localised in adults. Chronic disseminated disease may take the form of lymphadenopathy, painful oropharyngeal ulceration or destruction of tissues such as the adrenal glands. Progressive pulmonary paracoccidioidomycosis is characterised by multiple cavities that mimic tuberculosis, or by progressive fibrosis of the lower lobes with traction bronchiectasis and paracicatricial emphysema in a bilaterally symmetrical distribution. 192 The tissue response is generally granulomatous but may be purulent (Fig.  5.4.36) . Calcification is not a prominent feature. The diagnosis is established by recognising the spores in smears or culture of sputum or pus, or in tissue sections, or by serology.

Pulmonary involvement may occur through the inhalation of airborne spores, taking the form of an intracavitary fungal ball, comparable to an aspergilloma, or in conditions such as leukaemia it may be invasive and disseminate widely. 104, [215] [216] [217] [218] Allergic bronchopulmonary pseudallescheriosis is also described. 96 Pseudallerscheria boydii usually grows in hyphal form within the body but within air-filled cavities conidia may develop. The conidial state is known as Monosporium (syn. Scedosporium) apiospermum and infection showing such growth may be termed monosporiosis. The hyphae are slender, thin-walled and of fairly constant diameter with numerous septa and branching points. The hyphae are slightly indented at the septa. They are more slender and their branches less Pulmonary mycoses not dealt with above are rare and ordinarily occur as a result of lowering of the body's resistance by other diseases or their treatment. 193 Some examples are dealt with below.

Pulmonary involvement is rare and when present is generally secondary to disseminated lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis. Primary pulmonary sporotrichosis (involvement of the lung in the absence of cutaneous disease) is distinctly unusual. [201] [202] [203] However, because it mimics tuberculosis, its incidence may be greater than is generally recognised. The causative agent, Sporothrix schenckii, is a yeast-like fungus that occurs worldwide on decaying vegetation, contaminated soil and living plants, especially roses. Primary pulmonary sporotrichosis is acquired by inhalation of the spores and usually presents as a chronic, cavitary, bilateral, apical disease, most often in a clinical setting of alcoholism and chronic obstructive airway disease: less often it forms a solitary, necrotising, peripheral pulmonary nodule. 202 Fungal stains demonstrate many clearly dichotomous than those of aspergilli but the differences are insufficient to discriminate between them with confidence morphologically. This requires immunohistochemistry. 66 The distinction of these two fungi is important because their drug sensitivities differ. 217 ",

The yeasts therefore display clear central septation, unlike H. capsulatum and other fungi that divide by budding. Infection, which is highest after the rainy season, is by inhalation but the pulmonary changes are usually overshadowed by systemic features such as hepatosplenomegaly, skin lesions and bone marrow involvement. However, there may be diffuse infiltration, mass lesions or cavities in the lungs. While it can affect the immunocompetent, infection is mainly associated with AIDS, for which it is a clinical marker in the endemic areas. 220",

They are obligate intracellular parasites that infect many animals and have emerged as important opportunistic pathogens in AIDS. 221, 222 They are also being increasingly recognised in HIV-negative individuals. 223 Four microsporidian genera, Enterocytozoon, Encephalitozoon, Pleistophora and Nosema, have been reported to infect humans. Infection generally involves the gastrointestinal tract but may become generalised. 223, 224 Pulmonary involvement is unusual but heavy infestation of the tracheobronchial mucosa is recorded. [225] [226] [227] [228] [229] The infected respiratory epithelium may show focal proliferation with little inflammation or there may be a lymphocytic infiltrate of the airway epithelium similar to that seen in the bowel; heavy infestations cause sloughing and ulceration of the tracheobronchial mucosa and severe subacute inflammation. In haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections the parasite appears as a supranuclear 'blue body' but the staining is weak and it is easily overlooked, even when infestation is heavy. It is ovoid or spherical, and measures approximately 2 \u00b5m in length, and is Gram-positive. Microsporidia differ from cryptosporidia, which attach to the outer surface of infected epithelial cells, in being obligate intracellular parasites. Immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy and in situ hybridisation are useful for confirming the diagnosis. 230 Antiretroviral therapy has been shown to improve gastrointestinal symptoms, presumably through restoring immunity, 231 and albendazole has also been effective in some patients. This chapter describes infestation of the lungs by certain parasitic protozoa, helminths and arthropods, of which man may be either the natural or the accidental host. Protozoal diseases of the lungs include toxoplasmosis, leishmaniasis and amoebic abscess while severe malaria may be complicated by acute respiratory failure. Also, parasites usually confined to other organs may be identified in the lungs, for example cryptosporidia in AIDS and trichomonas in aspiration lesions.",

Toxoplas mosis is one of the most prevalent protozoal infections of man but the parasite rarely harms its host and the vast majority of human infections remain occult throughout life, causing damage only when cellular immunity is impaired. Gametogenesis and oocyst formation take place in the intestine of animals such as cats; outside the body, sporozoites are liberated which can infect other species, including man.

Up to this stage the parasites are scanty but if immunity is sufficiently impaired, enormous numbers of tachyzoites develop. These cause necrosis on a major scale. Air spaces may be filled with necrotic debris or broad tracts of the lung undergo coagulative necrosis. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] In one case macrophages filled with toxoplasma trophozoites formed a mass lesion. 8 Individual tachyzoites are very difficult to recognise in histological sections but their identification is facilitated by immunocytochemistry, 6, 7 which is superior to the Giemsa stain formerly used. The tachyzoites are crescentic in shape and measure within the range 4-7 \u00d7 2-3 \u00b5m with a prominent central nucleus. 9 The intracystic bradyzoites tend to be shorter and more rounded. The cysts, which represent the latent form of the parasite, lie free in the intercellular tissues and provoke no inflammatory response (Fig. 5.5.1 ). They vary considerably in size but are commonly of the order of 60 \u00b5m in diameter. Single tachyzoites are difficult to identify but they invade and proliferate within host cells to form distinctive collections known as pseudocysts.

Infection is acquired by the ingestion of food or water contaminated by amoebic cysts. Trophozoites develop in the small intestine and are carried to the large bowel, which they ulcerate. From there they may spread in the blood, giving rise to metastatic foci of infection. These are found most frequently in the liver, lungs and brain, in that order. Although the lesions in these organs are conventionally described as abscesses, they are not accompanied by suppuration unless there is secondary bacterial infection.",

More often, amoebic pulmonary abscesses are secondary to those in the liver: the amoebae pass though the diaphragm to infect the lungs and are therefore commoner in the right lung. Whether the pleural cavity becomes infected in the course of this extension of the disease from liver to lung depends on whether adhesions have formed that bind the apposed pleural surfaces sufficiently to protect the cavity from invasion. Pleuropulmonary complications develop in less than 5% of patients with intestinal amoebiasis but in 50% of those with liver abscesses. They may include bronchohepatic fistulas. 12 An amoebic abscess in the lung, like one in the liver, is essentially a focus of localised destruction in which part of the lung is converted into a cavity filled with reddish-brown, viscous fluid. There is little inflammatory reaction in the surrounding tissues but amoebae with their characteristic ingested erythrocytes may be seen in the zone faecal-oral transmission of an encysted form and generally involves drinking contaminated water. A small number of immunocompromised patients show respiratory as well as enteric infection, complaining of cough and chest pain (Fig. 5.5.3 ). [28] [29] [30] [31] Cryptosporidia are extracellular protozoan parasites which adhere to the surface of lining epithelia. They are seen as faintly haematoxyphil dots measuring up to 5 \u00b5m arrayed along the mucosal surface. In the respiratory tract they have been identified on the surface and glandular epithelium of the trachea and bronchi and in the lung parenchyma, associated with extensive squamous metaplasia of the conductive airways. 29 The superficial location of cryptosporidia helps distinguish them from microsporidia, which are found within the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Electron microscopy shows that cryptosporidia occupy a vacuole that communicates with the cell surface: they lie just beneath the level of cell membrane but are nevertheless extracellular.",

[42] [43] [44] In its early stages the disease is characterised by chest pain or discomfort. Later, when it has become chronic, there is persistent cough and recurrent haemoptysis. Characteristic operculate eggs can then be found in the sputum; they are golden-brown and measure about 90 \u00b5m in length. In some cases the presence of the parasite is borne well; in others it leads to anorexia and debility. As long as the flukes remain in the lungs the disease is rarely fatal, but should they reach the brain, as happens in a minority of cases, the prognosis is grave. Occasionally the disease mimics lung cancer. 45 Rapid and reliable immunodiagnostic methods are now available, and there are PCR techniques that distinguish individual species. 46, 47 The species most frequently responsible are Paragonimus westermani in the Far East and P.kellicotti in the Americas. 44 Morphologically these differ from each other only slightly. The adults infest the lungs of many predatory animals: P westermani in the dog, cat and pig, and P.kellicotti in the mink. Small groups of them become sexually mature within the lung tissue, where necrosis and the formation of a fibrous capsule produce characteristic 'worm cysts' (abscess cavities) that eventually enlarge and break into the bronchial lumen (Fig. 5.5.6 ). The ova that thus escape pass up the respiratory tract and are either expectorated or swallowed, to be eventually excreted in the stools. The life cycle of the fluke is a complex one: after several weeks in water or moist earth, the ovum hatches into a miracidium, a free-swimming form that eventually enters and parasitises water snails of the genus Melania. After its larval life in the snail, the fluke emerges as a cercaria, which in turn parasitises small fresh-water crabs and crayfish. It is through the consumption of these crustaceans, raw or insufficiently ",

            "text": "This disease has long been endemic in sheep-raising countries, notably Australia, New Zealand, Wales, parts of South Africa and South America, and the Middle East. 50 Control measures are steadily lessening its incidence. The dog is the usual host of the mature tapeworm, Echinococcus granulosus, and sheep the commonest host of its larval stage. The ova in the faeces of the dog reach sheep or man in contaminated food or water and, after hatching in the small intestine, larvae penetrate the gut wall and enter the portal circulation. Most are retained in the liver, but some negotiate the hepatic barrier to reach the systemic venous circulation and the lungs. The larval forms of this helminth thus tend to occur most frequently in the liver and the lungs. They take the form of hydatid cysts (Fig. 5.5.7) . If a hydatid cyst is demonstrated in the lung, others are almost always present in the liver. Pulmonary hydatid cysts are usually solitary but bilateral instances are recorded. [50] [51] [52] The wall of a hydatid cyst is formed of a semipermeable laminated capsule, which is composed of chitin, and an inner germinal layer. Outside these is the pericyst, formed of a layer of chronic inflammatory granulation tissue or a fibrous capsule, these representing the host reaction to the parasite (Figs 5.5.8 and 5.5.9). The germinal layer gives rise to brood capsules and from the germinal layer of these arise scolices. Free brood capsules and scolices form the hydatid 'sand' that can be seen as minute white grains in the otherwise clear cyst fluid (Fig. 5.5.10 ). When sheep tissues containing hydatid cysts are eaten by a dog, the scolices attach to the intestinal mucosa and develop into the adult worms, thus completing the life cycle. Scolices also have the potential to develop into secondary cysts if released by cyst rupture. They also form daughter cysts within the mother cyst, each daughter cyst being an exact true replica of the mother cyst. The daughter cysts may be packed together in the mother cyst or float freely in the mother cyst cavity. In older cysts, the contents degenerate into gelatinous material known as the matrix, which may be mistaken for pus. The cysts are usually bacteriologically sterile but they may become infected, resulting in true suppuration. Calcification commonly develops in the pericyst without affecting the viability of the parasite but calcification of the endocyst indicates that it is dead.",

In the lungs, the larvae pierce the alveolar wall to reach the air space, whence they are cleared to the pharynx to be swallowed. Maturation, copulation and ovulation occur in the small intestine.",

Infection is endemic in much of the tropics and subtropical regions. The filariform larvae of strongyloides, like those of hookworms and schistosomal cercariae, have the ability to penetrate intact human skin, following which they are carried to the lungs where they penetrate the alveoli and migrate via the airways and upper gastrointestinal tract to the small intestine. Here they mature into parthenogenetic adult females, the eggs of which release rhabditiform larvae within the intestine, unlike the eggs of other intestinal helminths which are passed intact in the faeces to embryonate in the soil. The rhabditiform larvae of Strongyloides may pass with the faeces to complete a free-living sexual cycle in the soil or differentiate within the intestine into filariform larvae, which are capable of penetrating the bowel wall or the perianal skin to repeat their parasitic asexual cycle, an endogenous process known as autoinfection. This difference between Strongyloides and other intestinal helminths is important in maintaining the infection and, in immunocompromised hosts, leading to potentially fatal hyperinfestation.",

This may happen when corticosteroid drugs are administered, particularly in the treatment of unrelated conditions but also because of resistant asthma caused by unrecognised strongyloidiasis. In cases of such asthma the dose of corticosteroids may be progressively increased when the patient would have been better treated with anti-helminthic drugs. 64 Worsening asthma as the steroid dosage is increased should alert the clinician to the possibility of hyperinfestation. Heavy infestation is often associated with blood eosinophilia and fleeting pulmonary opacities that represent eosinophilic pneumonia but these features may be absent in those who are immunosuppressed. Other risk factors include advanced age, chronic lung disease and altered cellular immunity, particularly that found in adult T-cell leukaemia complicating human T-lymphotropic retrovirus (HTLV-1) infection. [65] [66] [67] [68] The respiratory features in hyperinfestation may be those of the acute respiratory distress syndrome. At necropsy in such cases, the larvae are seen in huge numbers within the lumen and walls of airways of all sizes down to the alveoli and within interlobular septa (Fig. 5.5.11) . They excite an inflammatory response, chiefly of plasma cells with smaller numbers of lymphocytes and eosinophils. Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage may be seen. 69 More chronic infestation may result in restrictive lung disease due to interlobular septal fibrosis 70 or a mass lesion. 71 ",

The condition is benign and little is known of the changes in the lungs. Such reports as have been published describe whitish nodules 3 to 5 mm in diameter, scattered irregularly throughout the lungs. Histologically, the nodules are composed of groups of alveoli consolidated by eosinophils enmeshed in fibrin. In the centre of some of the nodules, the alveolar walls are destroyed and the area becomes an 'eosinophil abscess' . In others, a central collection of epithelioid cells becomes arranged in a palisade manner round deeply eosinophilic hyaline material that probably represents inspissated granules of eosinophil leukocytes. Giant cells and fibrosis are seen in some lesions and microfilariae are sometimes observed. 73, 74 The condition is thought to represent an immunopathological response to the parasite rather than direct damage by the microfilariae because it is confined to those individuals who are highly sensitised to filarial antigens.",

In man, the adult worm typically dies while it is immature and is carried from the heart to the lungs as a parasitic embolus to occlude a small pulmonary artery. This generally causes no symptoms. A necrotising granuloma forms about the dead worm and this is seen as an incidental 'coin' lesion in chest radiographs, 75 often prompting a needless thoracotomy as carcinoma is the principal differential diagnosis. The diagnosis is almost always made only when resected tissue is submitted to microscopy. The granuloma is rounded rather than wedge-shaped and is not haemorrhagic, appearances favouring an immune reaction to the worm rather than infarction. The young adult worm in the centre of the granuloma is about 3cm in length but the mature female measures up to 30cm x 2mm with the male about 20cm x 2mm.

Human infection is rare but isolated cases have been reported from the West Indies, Brazil, the Philippines and Korea. [87] [88] [89] [90] Affected patients complain of dyspnoea, cough, wheeze and pain or a feeling of tightness in the chest. Ova and adult worms may be found in the sputum or on bronchoscopy. The adults live off the host's blood and are therefore bright red. The female measures up to 2 cm and the male a quarter of this. They live in permanent copulation and since the vulva opens in the mid region of the female's body, each pair forms a characteristic Y shape. It must be disconcerting to see the paired worms wriggling away from the bronchoscopy forceps. 87 ",

Larvae develop in the human intestine and penetrate the wall to reach many viscera, including the lungs, where in their natural host they mature to adults but where in man they die. A recognisable larva is occasionally encountered in human lungs but more often, barely recognisable parasitic remnants are observed within encapsulated, partly calcified, necrotic debris. Their identification from other metazoal remnants may be impossible, even for professional parasitologists.",
