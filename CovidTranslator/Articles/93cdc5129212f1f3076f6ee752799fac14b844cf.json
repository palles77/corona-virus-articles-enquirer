A viral origin has been suggested for many of these diseases, emphasizing the importance of a continuous search for new viruses [1] [2] [3] . Major difficulties are encountered, however, when searching for new viruses. First, some viruses do not replicate in vitro, at least not in the cells that are commonly used in viral diagnostics. Second, for those viruses that do replicate in vitro and cause a cytopathic effect (CPE), the subsequent virus identification methods may fail. Antibodies raised against known viruses may not recognize the cultured virus, and virus-specific PCR methods may not amplify the new viral genome. To solve both problems, we developed a new method for virus discovery based on the cDNAamplified restriction fragment-length polymorphism technique (cDNA-AFLP 4 ). Here we report the identification of a new coronavirus using this method of Virus-Discovery-cDNA-AFLP (VIDISCA).",

Three serologically distinct groups of coronaviruses have been described. Within each group, viruses are characterized by their host range and genome sequence. Coronaviruses have been identified in mice, rats, chickens, turkeys, swine, dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, cattle and humans, and can cause a variety of severe diseases including gastroenteritis and respiratory tract diseases 5, 6 . Three human coronaviruses have been studied in detail. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were identified in the mid-1960s, and are known to cause the common cold [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The recently identified SARS-CoV causes a life-threatening pneumonia, and is the most pathogenic human coronavirus identified thus far [16] [17] [18] . SARS-CoV is likely to reside in an animal reservoir, and has recently initiated the epidemic in humans through zoonotic transmission 19, 20 . It has been suggested that SARS-CoV is the first member of a fourth group of coronaviruses, or that it is an outlier of group 2 (refs. 21, 22) .",

Diagnostic tests for respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3, rhinovirus, enterovirus, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 yielded negative results. The clinical sample was subsequently inoculated onto human fetal lung fibroblasts, tertiary monkey kidney cells (Cynomolgus monkey) and HeLa cells. CPE was detected exclusively on tertiary monkey kidney cells, and was first noted 8 d after inoculation. The CPE was diffuse, with a refractive appearance in the affected cells followed by cell detachment. More pronounced CPE was observed upon passage onto the monkey kidney cell line LLC-MK2, with overall cell rounding and moderate cell enlargement (Supplementary Fig. 1 online) . Additional subcultures on human fetal lung fibroblasts, rhabdomyosarcoma cells and Vero cells remained negative for CPE. Immunofluorescence assays to detect respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza viruses A and B, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 remained negative. Acid lability and chloroform sensitivity tests indicated that the virus was most likely enveloped, and did not belong to the picornavirus group 23 .",

To overcome this problem, we developed the VIDISCA method based on the cDNA-AFLP technique 4 . The advantage of VIDISCA is that prior knowledge of the sequence is not required, as the presence of restriction enzyme sites is sufficient to guarantee PCR amplification. The input sample can be either blood plasma or serum, or culture supernatant. Whereas cDNA-AFLP starts with isolated mRNA, VIDISCA begins with a treatment to selectively enrich for viral nucleic acid, including a centrifugation step to remove residual cells and mitochondria (Fig. 1a) . A DNase treatment is also used to remove interfering chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA from degraded cells (viral nucleic acid is protected within the viral particle). Finally, by choosing frequently cutting restriction enzymes, the method can be fine-tuned such that most viruses will be amplified. We were able to amplify viral nucleic acids in EDTA-treated plasma from a person with hepatitis B viral infection, and from a person with an acute parvovirus B19 infection (Fig. 1b) . The technique can also detect HIV-1 in cell culture, demonstrating its capacity to identify both RNA and DNA viruses (Fig. 1b) .",

The N-terminal region of the S protein has been implicated in binding to aminopeptidase N (group I coronaviruses) and sialic acid [31] [32] [33] , so the 179-amino acid insert in HCoV-NL63 might be involved in receptor binding and may explain the tropism of this virus in cell culture. However, the aminopeptidase N receptor-binding domain of the HCoV-229E S protein has been mapped to amino acids 407-547 (ref. 33) , so it seems unlikely that the insertion will be directly involved in binding to aminopeptidase N. Fourth, whereas HCoV-229E is fastidious in cell culture with a narrow host range, HCoV-NL63 replicates efficiently in monkey kidney cells. SARS-CoV is also able to replicate in monkey kidney cells (Vero-E6 cells 34 ), yet the predicted S proteins of SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 do not share a domain that could explain the in vitro host cell range of these viruses. Other viral proteins may influence the cell tropism of a virus, but none of the HCoV-NL63 proteins were more closely related to SARS-CoV than to HCoV-229E. Variability at the 5\u2032 end of the S gene, correlating with alterations in tropism, has also been described for the group 1 coronaviruses porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). These porcine viruses are antigenically and genetically related, but their pathogenicity is markedly different. TGEV replicates in and destroys the enterocytes of the small intestine, causing severe diarrhea with high mortality in neonatal swine. In contrast, PRCoV (which emerged more recently than TGEV) has a selective tropism for respiratory tissue, and very little capacity to replicate in intestinal tissue. The difference between the TGEV and PRCoV S gene sequences is comparable to the difference between those of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E 35 . Compared with TGEV, PRCoV contains a deletion in the 5\u2032 hypervariable region of the S gene. The extra region that is present at the 5\u2032 end of the TGEV S gene is responsible for the hemagglutination activity of TGEV, and its capacity to bind to a b Figure 4 HCoV-NL63 genome organization and phylogenetic analysis. sialic acid 32 . However, this region shows no similarity to the HCoV-NL63 insert.",

Our data indicate that HCoV-NL63 causes acute respiratory disease in children below the age of 1 year, and in immunocompromised adults. To date, no known viral pathogen can be identified in a substantial portion of respiratory disease cases in humans (20-30%; ref. 38) . Several assays have been used to diagnose coronavirus infections. Traditionally, an antibody test is implemented to measure a rise in titers of antibodies to the human coronaviruses HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43 (ref. 12 ). Antibodies to HCoV-NL63 might cross-react with HCoV-229E, given that these viruses are members of the same serotype. If this were the case, HCoV-NL63 infections might have been misdiagnosed as HCoV-229E. Molecular biology tools such as RT-PCR assays 39, 40 were designed to selectively detect the human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, but these assays will not detect HCoV-NL63. Even the RT-PCR assay that was designed to amplify all known coronaviruses 40 is not able to amplify HCoV-NL63 because of several mismatches with the primer sequences. The availability of the complete HCoV-NL63 genome sequence means that these diagnostic assays can be substantially improved.",

To remove residual cells and mitochondria, 110 \u00b5l of virus culture supernatant was spun for 10 min at maximum speed (13,500 r.p.m.) in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. To remove chromosomal DNA and mitochondrial DNA from the lysed cells, 100 \u00b5l of supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and treated with DNase I for 45 min at 37 \u00b0C (Ambion). Nucleic acids were extracted as described 41 . A reverse transcription reaction was performed with random hexamer primers (Amersham Bioscience) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV-RT; Invitrogen). Second-strand DNA synthesis was carried out with Sequenase II (Amersham Bioscience), without further addition of a primer. A phenol-chloroform extraction was followed by ethanol precipitation. cDNA-AFLP was performed essentially as described 4 , with some modifications. The doublestranded DNA was digested with the HinP1I and MseI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs). MseI and HinP1I anchors (see below) were subsequently added, along with 5U ligase enzyme (Invitrogen) in the supplied ligase buffer, for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. The MseI and HinP1I anchors were prepared by mixing a top-strand oligonucleotide (5\u2032-CTCG-TAGACTGCGTACC-3\u2032 for the MseI anchor and 5\u2032-GACGATGAGTCCTGAC-3\u2032 for the HinP1I anchor) with a bottom-strand oligonucleotide (5\u2032-TAGGTACGCAGTC-3\u2032 for the MseI anchor and 5\u2032-CGGTCAGGACTCAT-3\u2032 for the HinP1I anchor) in a 1:40 dilution of ligase buffer. Twenty cycles of PCR were carried out with 10 \u00b5l of the ligation mixture, 100 ng of HinP1I standard primer (5\u2032-GACGATGAGTCCTGACCGC-3\u2032) and 100 ng of MseI standard primer (5\u2032-CTCGTAGACTGCGTACCTAA-3\u2032). Five microliters of this PCR product was used as input in the second 'selective' amplification step, along with 100 ng HinP1I N-primer and 100 ng MseI N-primer (the 'N' indicates that the standard primers were extended with one nucleotide; G, A, T or C). The selective rounds of amplification were done using 'touchdown PCR': 10 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 60 s, 65 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min (annealing temperature reduced by 1 \u00b0C per cycle); 23 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 56 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min; and finally 1 cycle of 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. Sixteen PCR reactions, each with 1 of the 16 primer combinations, were conducted for each sample in this selective PCR. The PCR products were analyzed on 4% Metaphor agarose gels (Cambrex), and the fragments of interest were cloned and sequenced using BigDye terminator reagents. Electrophoresis and data collection were performed using an ABI 377 instrument. DNA molecular weight markers were from Invitrogen and Eurogentec.",
