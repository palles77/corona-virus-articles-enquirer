Harris (2000) estimates that expenditure to remove landmines from Cambodia would produce benefits-in the form of saved lives, reduced injuries and medical costs, and greater farm output-that are worth just 2% of the costs. In Mozambique, the benefits would be worth only 10% of the costs (Elliot & Harris, 2001) . Similarly, Mitchell (2004) suggests that landmines are not serious impediments to economic development in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and argues that general promotion of demining as a development action is unwarranted. An exception to these negative results is the study by Harris (2002) of mine clearance in Afghanistan in which a positive net present value is obtained. However, even in that study the value of lives saved and disabilities avoided is only 35% of the total annual benefit of landmine clearance, with more benefit from saving dairy cattle.",

            "text": "As noted by Paterson (2001) , the study by Harris (2000) discounts the benefits of mine clearance, but not the costs, even though the clearance program is spread over 25 years. While discounting costs substantially reduces the size of the negative NPV, the estimated benefits are still only 5% of costs. Paterson also notes that the study by Harris, and by implication the other studies cited above, fail to note that landmine programs involve targeted clearance operations rather than an ''average'' clearance task so that mine fields with the greatest benefits are likely to be cleared first. For example, Paterson suggests that in Cambodia the clearance of landmines that prevent the use of existing infrastructure or allow new development projects such as access roads, water systems, and irrigation works are likely to yield significant economic returns. As a result, the true economic benefits of real landmine programs are seriously underestimated. A recent cost-benefit study undertaken by Gildestad (2005) shows positive benefit-cost ratios for clearing irrigation systems, water supplies, roads and bridges, school premises, health stations, and historical sites in Cambodia, while costs do not generally cover benefits for the clearance of agricultural lands. Applying these results to the overall Cambodian clearance program in 2004 Gildestad finds that benefits were 38% higher than costs. 1 The conclusions from existing cost-benefit analyses of landmine clearance may have been influenced by inadequate data. These studies value injuries and premature death according to the present value of lost earnings (or lost GDP). 2 This foregone earnings approach is no longer popular in developed countries because it ignores risk aversion and underestimates the value of life (Rosen, 1988) . Instead, developed countries now use estimates of the value of statistical life (VSL). This VSL is calculated either from reports by survey respondents of how much they would be willing to pay to avoid risks (or how much they would need to be paid to accept risks) or from market-based, revealed preference studies. The theoretical superiority of VSL measures is recognized in the landmine clearance literature (e.g., Harris, 2000) but because no estimates exist for countries with landmine problems, imperfect foregone earnings methods are used. Perhaps as a result, saved lives and disabilities are a small part of the calculated benefit of landmine clearance, whereas the value of statistical life is easily the largest benefit of environmental, health, and safety rules in developed countries (Shogren & Stamland, 2002) .",

Most landmines are located in poor countries, but most landmine clearance is paid for by rich country donors and NGOs. Elliot and Harris (2001) suggest that donors may value the lives saved by clearing mines using standards from their own (rich) countries. Over-valuing saved lives could explain why landmine clearance standards are so strict, requiring 100% removal of mines and UXO (UNMAS, 2003) . This standard favors expensive manual clearance because existing machines cannot find every single mine. In contrast, it is socially efficient to reduce the risk from landmines only to the point where the marginal cost per life saved is the same as for other risk reducing activities (Viscusi, 2000) .",

The incidence rate of landmine fatalities and injuries is 34 per 100,000 in the affected communities and 0.28 per 100,000 when calculated for the whole country (SAC, 2003) .

Therefore, to illustrate the implications of the VSL estimates for cost-benefit studies of mine clearance, we reconsider the study by Gildestad (2005) of mine clearance in neighboring Cambodia. The use of more plausible VSL measures that would follow from our study increases the importance of human benefits relative to development benefits in assessing targeted clearance. These results also show that the value of VSL used is decisive in making judgements about the economic value of clearing agricultural land and in setting clearance priorities. In addition to adding to the literature on the costs and benefits of landmine clearance, our study is also relevant to the broader literature on the value THE VALUE OF STATISTICAL LIFE AND THE ECONOMICS OF LANDMINE CLEARANCE 513 of risk reduction. A key requirement for any rational risk policy is knowledge of the value to place on lives saved by interventions that aim to reduce risk. In contrast to the developed countries, almost nothing is known about the value of statistical life in developing countries. A recent survey of 70 VSL estimates finds only four that come from countries that might once have been considered as developing (Taiwan and South Korea) and none from currently developing countries (Miller, 2000) .",

However, it has long been recognized that income foregone (or net income after deducting an allowance for consumption) is inadequate as a basis for assessing the value of lives saved (Rosen, 1988) . No value is placed on life itself, the trauma of death, or the psychological affect of living in fear of premature death resulting from a particular risk. 3 Perhaps because of this, the value of lives saved is only a small proportion of estimated total benefits in existing studies of landmine clearance.",

This study clearly shows that the values of statistical life obtained using contingent valuation or revealed preference methods are not close to estimates based on the present value of lifetime income foregone. For the world as a whole, suggested VSL estimates are between 137 and 195 times GDP per capita, or approximately 14-20 times the present value of lifetime GDP per capita for a 40 year working life and 10% discount rate. The ratio of VSL measures to GDP per capita is likely to be higher for developing countries, so the existing literature on the benefits of landmine clearance may have substantially understated the benefits. Positive benefit-cost ratios for some provinces and some types of clearance e Notes: All present values are calculated at 10% discount rate. PV is present value. a Based on a 40 year working life. b Benefits are discounted but costs are not, so the reported NPV is not valid. c In her own calculations, Mitchell uses a 5% discount rate, giving a lifetime PV of $35,400. d This is an approximate value, Gildestad calculates a value for both adults and children. e Section 6 below has more details on the benefit-cost ratios from this study.",

Khon Kaen is adjacent to landmine-affected areas but is not mined. This may help the contingent valuation method because participants are asked to make comparisons between hypothetical areas with different incomes and levels of risk. These risk comparisons may be less influenced by the perceptions of actual accident risk than they would be in communities directly affected by landmines. The general methodology chosen for the survey was based on that used by Viscusi, Magat, and Huber (1991) in studying chronic bronchitis and auto fatality risk in the US. Perreira and Sloan (2002) have also used this approach in considering disability and death risks in the US. The survey design and its application were adapted to enable this approach to be applied in low income rural communities, and to address the issues of concern in this study.",

Thus, in determining risk-money tradeoffs the respondents were not directly asked about their willingness to pay for a reduction in risk, or the amount required to accept an increase in risk. This approach makes it possible to avoid issues associated with who will or should pay for landmine clearance, how payments will be made, and exactly what the payments are for. These types of issues would be important for the low income communities involved in this survey. While respondents were not directly asked for their willingness to pay to reduce risk or willingness to accept risk, the way in which the alternatives were presented could be interpreted in these terms since risk increases may be valued differently from risk decreases (Viscusi et al., 1991) . To provide a test of the sensitivity of results to the way in which the alternatives are presented two questionnaires were used in this study, one that could be interpreted in ''willingness to pay'' terms and one with a ''willingness to accept'' focus.",

Instead, in this survey cash income and the change in cash income between areas was used to represent the money component of risk-money tradeoffs. To help respondents think about their current income levels they were asked about their family's cash expenses during the last month. To check comprehension the respondents were initially asked for their preference between alternatives in which one area was dominant, since it had a higher cash income level and lower probability of death, or lower probabilities of both death THE VALUE OF STATISTICAL LIFE AND THE ECONOMICS OF LANDMINE CLEARANCE 515 and injury in risk-risk comparisons.

This process continued through a series of up to four iterations until preference switched to Area A or the income in Area A reached B 16,800. The questionnaire contained a flowchart that directed interviewers through the iterations (see Appendix 1 for an English version of the Thai flowchart used in data collection). Any switch in preference provides a range within which the income level that would make the areas indifferent should lie. The respondent was then asked what level of income in Area B would make the areas equally desirable. If this value was inconsistent with the range of incomes implied by the preference switch, this survey response was disregarded. This process provided an additional consistency check.

The importance of starting point bias has been noted in the literature, although empirical evidence is mixed (Stalhammer, 1996) . Perreira and Sloan (2002) use randomly selected initial values to avoid this bias. This approach was considered for the current survey but abandoned because of the increase in the complexity of the survey for interviewers, and the increased number of iterations necessary to find indifference. Testing for starting point bias would be a useful feature of future surveys in developing countries.",

It has been estimated that 46% of villages in Cambodia suffer some degree of contamination (CMAA, 2003) . From 1979 to 2003 there were approximately 60,000 mine/UXO casualties. While casualties have decreased over time, they have remained at between 700 and 900 per year since 2000 (CMVIS, 2000 (CMVIS, -2004 . 25 Around two-thirds of victims are adults, although half of UXO victims are children (CMVIS, 2000 (CMVIS, -2004 . Gildestad (2005) estimates the cost and benefits resulting from the clearance of 1 km 2 of high priority contaminated land for a variety of uses across the principal mine affected provinces in Cambodia. Two demining cost figures are used based on the costs of existing mine clearance programs, $0.70 m 2 and $0.90 m 2 . Benefits from clearance include human benefits, the value of casualties and medical costs saved, and development benefits, revenue from new production or tourism and travel costs saved.",

Household annual 522 WORLD DEVELOPMENT income in the area of Thailand where the VSL estimates came from is approximately $2,872. 28 We assume a value of household income of $700 for Cambodia based on the figures provided by Gildestad. The estimates of the elasticity of VSL with respect to income give some indication of the VSL measures that might be relevant given this income base. Miller (2000) suggests elasticities in the range 0.85-1.0, while Viscusi and Aldy (2003) report elasticities of 0.5-0.6. Using the mean VSL of $248,500 for Thailand, and applying elasticities of 1.0 and 0.5, gives VSL estimates of $60,546 and $122,661. We also show the results when using the mean VSL for Thailand, which would apply to Cambodia if it was an elasticity of zero. Gildestad distinguishes between adults and children in calculating the human benefits of clearance. In his model, an adult life saved in the first year would have a present value of approximately $25,000 compared with a value of $21,000 for a child's life saved. In applying our VSL estimates we have ignored possible differences between adult and child VSL measures. VSLs can also be expected to change over time as the real incomes increase. We apply the growth assumptions used by Gildestad and the three elasticities above to revise the VSL estimates for lives saved in the future. The mean injury risk-death risk tradeoff of 5.1 is used to estimate of the value of reductions in amputations. Following Gildestad, we assume that the value of reductions in other injuries is 57% of the value of an amputation saved. Table 6 compares the results obtained for the clearance of agricultural land by province obtained by Gildestad given a clearance cost of $0.90 m 2 with the equivalent calculations based on our VSL estimates. For all but Pailin province the estimates obtained by Gildestad suggest that the clearance of agricultural land is uneconomic. 29 Given VSL values equivalent to those in Thailand clearing agricultural land would be economic in all but two provinces. For VSL measures based on an income elasti-city of 0.5 clearing agricultural land in four of the nine provinces would be economic. Thus, for agricultural land the VSL measure used is likely to be decisive in making judgments about the economic value of clearance and in setting clearance priorities.",
