Marthi et al. have shown that lower temperature and higher humidity conditions increased survival of bacteria during aerosol exposures. Humidity not only affects viability during aerosol exposure but also during sampling (Kim et al. 2007 ). Viability of microbes can also be affect by parameters such as droplet size, exposure time duration, type of nebulizing media. Larger droplet sizes have shown to assist in increased survivability of microbes (Marthi et al. 1990) . Pressures used in the Collison nebulizer can affect the viability of bacteria (Stone & Johnson 2002) .",

Microscopic examination has demonstrated significant clumping of mycobacteria even after sonication. Bacterial aggregation may explain the greater variation among experiments, and the greater GSD observed with M. tuberculosis. The greater GSD may also be due to the suspension of M. tuberculosis in PBS, while all other aerosols were suspended in de-ionized water (Fig. 5 ). This produces a polydisperse particle size distribution of particles not only of M. tuberculosis but also solvent particles of PBS. The APS measures aerodynamic particle sizes between 0.542 \u03bcm to 19.81 \u03bcm. Based on the microscopic size of these bacteria, we expected that viable bacteria would have an aerodynamic diameter within this range. Smaller particles are present in these aerosols and are composed of solvent generated particles and debris from bacteria damaged by the Collison nebulizer during aerosolization. We did not consider the smaller particles when calculating CMAD, MMAD, or GSD.",

Incomplete capture means that the calculated viable aerosol concentration is an underestimate. Even though the dose presented based on the viable aerosol concentration might have been slightly underestimated the dose retained for all the three microbes (Tables 1-3) was lower than the dose presented. Multiple factors may explain this reduction. Only a fraction of the dose presented is actually deposited in the lungs. Some particles lodge in the upper airways, and some particles may reach the lungs but be exhaled without deposition. Lastly, bacteria deposited in the lungs may be cleared anatomically or killed by host defense mechanisms before necropsy. The measured dose retained may increase over time if bacteria replicate after deposition. We chose the time of necropsy based on the rate of replication of the various bacteria to minimize the effect of replication (one hour after aerosol delivery for B. anthracis and Y. pestis; 24 hours for M. tuberculosis).",

The Madison chamber is connected to a Class III BSC. The AeroMP receives real-time data from the chamber pressure sensor, RH/temperature probe, and APS. It controls the nebulizer flow, dilution air flow, humidifier, BioSampler, and APS. Bacteria or polystyrene latex spheres were aerosolized in the Madison chamber using a Collison nebulizer. Aerosols were sampled through the multisampling port and analyzed using the APS. The actual counts were normalized to a peak of 1.0 for this figure. Bacteria or polystyrene latex spheres were aerosolized using a Collison nebulizer. The APS sampled the aerosol inside the Madison chamber through the multisampling port. The APS measured aerodynamic particle sizes, and used this data to estimate particle mass. Mass distributions were normalized to a peak of 1.0 for this figure. . anthracis spores at a concentration of 9.90e8 CFU/mL were nebulized using a 6-jet Collison nebulizer at 13 lpm (19 PSI). A/J mice (n = 2) were exposed in the Madison chamber for 60 minutes. The B. anthracis aerosol was sampled using an AGI-4 impinger at 6 lpm. Dose retained in the lungs was measured by culturing a lung homogenate obtained 1 hr after exposure.",
