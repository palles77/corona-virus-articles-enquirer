The increased human cases and high mortality rate of MERS-CoV infection make it essential to develop safe and effective vaccines. In this review, the current advancements and potential strategies in the development of MERS vaccines, particularly subunit vaccines based on MERS-CoV spike (S) protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD), are discussed. How to improve the efficacy of subunit vaccines through novel adjuvant formulations and routes of administration as well as currently available animal models for evaluating the in vivo efficacy of MERS-CoV vaccines are also addressed. Overall, these strategies may have important implications for the development of effective and safe vaccines for MERS-CoV in the future.",

Based on a sequence fragment identical to MERS-CoV found in a Taphozous perforates bat captured in Saudi Arabia, it has been inferred that bats are the most likely reservoir for MERS-CoV [3] . The identification of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels and the detection of neutralizing antibodies in the sera of these animals suggest that camels could be the intermediate host of MERS-CoV [4, 5] . It is thus suspected that MERS-CoV emerged as interspecies transmission from bats to other animals, such as camels, and then to humans [6] .",

Most people who were infected with MERS-CoV developed severe acute respiratory illness with symptoms like fever, cough and shortness of breath. The virus has an estimated incubation period of 12 days [9] . The transmissibility of MERS-CoV between humans is currently less efficient than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), which emerged in Guangdong Province in China in 2002 and re-emerged in 2004, with over 8000 cases and more than 700 deaths in 29 countries throughout the world [10] . Nonetheless, the mortality rate for MERS (~43%) is much higher than that for SARS (~10%) [11] . It has been reported that MERS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV, could replicate in cell lines from four major chiropteran families, implying the ability of MERS-CoV in crossing species barrier between humans and bats [12] . With increased human cases and high mortality rate, MERS-CoV infection has raised serious global concerns, although it is still too early to implicate any impending pandemic. Vaccination is considered one of the most effective strategies to prevent virus infection. Thus, development of effective vaccines is essential to fight against this infectious disease.",

            "text": "Similar to the S proteins of other CoVs, the S protein of MERS-CoV also contains S1 and S2 subunits, with S1 being responsible for receptor binding and S2 for membrane fusion [32] . Unlike CoVs SARS-CoV and NL63-CoV, which use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as their receptors [33, 34] , MERS-CoV utilizes human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) as its cellular receptor. DPP4 is expressed on primary bronchiolar epithelial cells and regulates the activity of hormones and chemokines through proteolytic cleavage [12, 35] . Recent studies have solved the crystal structures of MERS-CoV S protein alone, or complexed with its receptor DPP4, and mapped the RBD of MERS-CoV to the residues covering 367-588 or 367-606, respectively [32, 36, 37] . According to the crystal structures, the RBD of MERS-CoV also contains the core and receptor-binding M a y 2 9 , 2 0 1 3 J u n 2 6 , 2 0 1 3 J u l 2 9 , 2 0 1 3 A u g 2 8 , 2 0 1 3 S e p t 2 0 , 2 0 1 3 O c t 2 9 , 2 0 1 3 N o v 2 9 , 2 0 1 3 D e c 2 2 , 2 0 1 3 J a n 2 7 , 2 0 1 4 F e b 2 7 , 2 0 1 4 M a r 2 6 , 2 0 1 4 Laboratory confirmed human cases with MERS-CoV subdomains, with the receptor-binding motif consisting of 84 amino acids (from V484 to L567) that form a fourstranded antiparallel b-sheet (FIGURE 3B) [32, 36] . Similar to other CoVs, the HR1 and HR2 of MERS-CoV form a 6-helix bundle believed to drive virion-cell membrane fusion, with three HR1 helices forming the central coiledcoil core and three HR2 chains surrounding the core in the HR1 side grooves [23, 38, 39] . FIGURE 4 describes the crystal structures of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RBD complexed with their respective receptors, and the major neutralizing epitopes on SARS-CoV RBD for the neutralizing monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV [36,40-42]. Understanding of these neutralizing epitopes in RBD of SARS-CoV will provide useful guidance for the identification of the neutralizing epitopes in MERS-CoV RBD and, hence designing RBD-based, neutralizing epitope-dependent vaccines against MERS-CoV.",

Therefore, caution should be taken when the full-length S protein of MERS-CoV is used as a vaccine antigen since the non-neutralizing epitopes in S protein may induce antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE) effects, as those elicited by the S protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV, also a CoV) [54] .",

Apparently, both local and serum antibody responses can be induced in inactivated SARS-CoV vaccinated mice [64] . Like SARS-CoV, it might be possible to attenuate MERS-CoV by deleting the envelope E protein to diminish virus growth in tissue culture, while abrogating virulence in animals [65, 66] , or by inactivating exonuclease activity.

In addition, IgG antibody and T-cell-mediated immune responses are induced by DNA vaccines encoding S1 of SARS-CoV The above findings on SARS-CoV VLPs may be applied to constructing VLPs for MERS-CoV. Compared with inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines, VLPs do not contain the infectious materials, making VLP technology a promising alternative for MERS vaccine development. However, the immunogenicity of VLPs is relatively lower than that of inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines. Several strategies may be explored to increase the immunogenicity of VLPs. For example, dendritic cell-stimulating molecules or Toll-like receptor 5 ligand flagellin can be genetically engineered for incorporation into MERS-CoV VLPs to increase immunogenicity and enhance protective efficacy against further heterosubtypic virus challenge [90, 91] .",

Normally, vaccines with limited immunogenicity require the addition of specific adjuvants to stimulate a protective and long-lasting immune response [96] [97] [98] . Although a variety of novel adjuvants are now emerging and being investigated, only a few have been approved for clinical use. Both aluminum salt-based adjuvants, usually called 'Alum' and MF59 TM can induce antigen-specific humoral and CTL responses [99,100]; hence, they have the potential for use in MERS-CoV subunit vaccines. Another adjuvant named glucopyranosyl lipid A, a synthetic TLR4 agonist, was also shown to improve the immunogenicity of a protein-based vaccine candidate [101] . Other adjuvants, such as Montanide ISA51, which has been approved for human use in Europe [102, 103] , is used in making MERS and influenza subunit vaccines, demonstrating a strong ability to promote the induction of highly potent immune responses of these candidate vaccines [56, 57, 104] . Furthermore, the combination of two adjuvants with distinct mechanisms of action is also feasible to improve the efficacy of designed MERS subunit vaccines. Since Alum alone cannot induce strong Th1 immune responses, it is thus applicable to combine Alum with other adjuvants with potential complementary effects in a hope to improve the efficacy induced by Alum-adjuvanted subunit vaccines. For example, combination of Alum plus glucopyranosyl lipid A will be applied to improve the efficacy of a SARS-CoV RBD protein-based subunit vaccine [45] .

Reports have indicated that i.n. vaccination effectively induced both local and systemic immune responses, especially mucosal IgA, against mucosal pathogens, cross-protecting vaccinated animals from infection by homologous and heterologous strains of influenza virus [115] , as well as providing long-term protection against SARS-CoV infection [81] . As an important mucosal pathogen infecting humans via the mucosal pathway [9], MERS vaccines delivered via the mucosal route are anticipated to elicit effective mucosal immune responses, as represented by mucosal IgA. Intranasal immunization of a subunit candidate vaccine containing recombinant RBD protein fused with Fc of human IgG has been demonstrated to induce strong anti-RBD-and anti-S1-specific neutralizing antibody responses, particularly IgA mucosal immune responses, against infections from MERS-CoV [93], providing a fundamental basis for developing effective MERS mucosal vaccines.",

Unlike SARS-CoV, which can infect a variety of animals, including non-human primates, and small animal models such as ferrets, hamsters and mice [76, 78, [116] [117] [118] , the animal species that could be infected by MERS-CoV are very limited. It has been shown that MERS-CoV is unable to replicate in hamsters, ferrets and mice [119] [120] [121] [122] , significantly restricting the efficacy evaluation of MERS vaccines in small animal models. Although rhesus macaques can be infected by MERS-CoV, with the infected animals showing clinical signs of disease and virus replication [123, 124] , the high cost of non-human primate models would prevent the majority of researchers from using this animal model. Therefore, the development of effective small animal models for MERS-CoV infection is urgently needed [125] . It was recently reported that mice transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing MERS-CoV's receptor DPP4 were susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, with the infected mice developing pneumonia and clinical disease accompanied by histopathological changes [126] . Nevertheless, a better transgenic mouse model with the gene encoding human DPP4 integrated into its genome has been developed by several laboratories [127] .",

            "text": "considered to improve the immunogenicity of DNA-based MERS vaccines [77]. vector-based vaccines Viral vectors have been applied as an important delivery vehicle for developing candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV infection. Currently, reported viral vectors for SARS vaccines include MVA, vesicular stomatitis virus, rhabdovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus and attenuated parainfluenza virus [78-80].Previous reports have indicated the ability of an MVA-based vaccine expressing SARS-CoV S protein in the induction of neutralizing antibody with protection of vaccinated mice against SARS-CoV challenge[78]. In addition, a combination of adenoviral-based SARS vaccines encoding S1, M and NP protein, respectively, induced strong neutralizing antibodies and Tcell immune responses, protecting immunized monkeys from challenge of SARS-CoV[80]. The induction of sufficient cellular and humoral immune responses has also been demonstrated with neutralizing activity by an adeno-associated virus-based vaccine containing RBD of SARS-CoV in the protection of SARS-CoV challenge[81,82]. The above approaches for developing viral vector-based SARS vaccines can be adopted for the development of MERS vaccines. Indeed, MERS-CoV S protein delivered by an MVA vector induces in the vaccinated mice antibody responses with neutralizing activity [52], bringing some hopes for the development of viral vector-based vaccines to prevent MERS-CoV infection. However, it should be noted that viral vectorbased vaccines do have some disadvantages. For example, some vectors, such as MVA or adenovirus, have pre-existing immunity, or cause harmful immune responses [83,84] and inflammation [85]. Thus, caution should be taken when developing MERS vaccines using viral vectors.VLP-based vaccines have been developed as a new generation of non-egg-based, cell culture-derived vaccine candidates against virus infection, and thus have gained much more attention for their potential promise in developing effective and safe vaccines against SARS-CoV [86]. VLPs can be produced in several expression systems, such as mammalian cells (e.g., 293T, CHO), yeast, recombinant vaccinia virus and baculovirus expression systems[87,88]. It is worth noting that the minimal components essential for VLP formation and the immunogenicity induced by VLPs need to be considered. Although M and E proteins of SARS-CoV are sufficient for the efficient formation of VLPs[89], the immunogenicity induced by VLPs without S protein might be greatly reduced. By comparison, chimeric VLPs carrying SARS-CoV S protein, and E, M and N proteins of MHV-CoV elicited high levels of SARS-CoVspecific neutralizing antibodies, protecting vaccinated mice from SARS-CoV challenge[88].",
