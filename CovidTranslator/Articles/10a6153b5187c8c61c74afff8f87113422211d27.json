For the first few weeks, the epidemic in Singapore was not in the phase of 76 exponential growth, which suggests secondary transmissions are limited and any long chains of 77 transmission did not succeed yet. The first 18 cases discussed here are in the first two weeks of 78 the epidemic. Here we assessed whether the 12 initial 'imported' cases were in fact imported or the result 90 of ongoing transmission in Singapore.
