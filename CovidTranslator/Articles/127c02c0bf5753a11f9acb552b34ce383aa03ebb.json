Nursing stands at an opportunity intersection where challenging global health issues, an international workforce shortage, and massive growth of ICT combine to create a very unique space for nursing leadership and nursing intervention. Learning from prior successes in the field can assist nurse leaders in planning and advancing strategies for global health using ICT. Attention to lessons learned will assist in combating the technological apartheid that is already present in many areas of the globe and will highlight opportunities for innovative applications in health. ICT has opened new channels of communication, creating the beginnings of a global information society that will facilitate access to isolated areas where health needs are extreme and where nursing can contribute significantly to the achievement of \"Health for All.\" The purpose of this article is to discuss the relationships between globalization, health, and ICT, and to illuminate opportunities for nursing in this flattening and increasingly interconnected world.",

            "text": "Globalization and health have been discussed by many experts who have noted influences on wellness that are both promising and potentially devastating. [5] [6] [7] [8] Globalization in a positive sense has resulted in trade expansion, with an increase in living standards and improved social and economic status, particularly for women. Sachs, a global economist known for his work in developing nations, repeatedly makes the important point that the health of a nation is directly tied to the wealth of a nation. 9 Wealth is enhanced by heightened competition, comparative advantage, economies of scale, and access to a greater range of products and services in globalized markets, all enabled by access to knowledge. Asymmetries of information have been reduced in an era of globalized knowledge exchange, contributing to a reduction of isolation, an increase in life spans, and improved health. 10 Conversely, advances in globalization are blamed for some health problems, including an increased adoption of unhealthy Western habits and lifestyle, resulting in increases in obesity and the increased prevalence of chronic disease. Open borders and open access, hallmarks of globalization, have also resulted in faster transmission of infectious agents, the so-called \"microbial hitchhikers.\" Many societies find globalization and open information exchange threatening to current ideologies and social structure. Others view the concept of globalization, particularly via ICT, as a new age form of electronic colonialism, where existent cultures are bulldozed and assimilated. 11 How does ICT fit in this discussion of health and globalization? The World Health Organization (WHO) believes that ICT holds great promise for improving health and health care around the world and is critical to achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. 12 The core beliefs that ICT will contribute significantly to the reduction of poverty, improve the delivery of education and health care, and make government services more accessible are prominent in the 2006 World Health Report. The 2007 report, Towards a Safer Future, continues to emphasize the importance of ICT in relation to health: \"Today, the public health security of all countries depends on the capacity of each to act effectively and contribute to the security of all. The world is rapidly changing and nothing today moves faster than information. This makes the sharing of essential health information one of the most feasible routes to global public health security.\" 13 A widely held view, both within the WHO and elsewhere, is that ICT in health enables rapid and global access to new therapies, techniques, and knowledge resources, with the potential to forever change the health of nations. The role of ICT in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis of 2003 is a prime example. During the first cases of SARS in China in 2003, the WHO initiated a digital virtual environment consisting of 11 laboratories in 9 countries connected via ICT. Using e-mail and a secure website, these collaborators shared outcomes, post-mortem tissue analysis, electron-microscope pictures of viruses, genetic sequences and other related materials in real-time to collaboratively identify and intervene in a markedly dangerous public health risk. Other examples exist that point to the impact that ICT has had on global health efforts, such as the Academic Model for the Prevention and Treatment of HIV/AIDS Medical Record System for Africa (AMPATH-MRS), the Partners in Health Electronic Medical Record in Peru, the HIV Electronic Medical Record System in Haiti. 14 Efforts such as those mentioned above and scores of others, too extensive to enumerate, have made significant impacts in the health of large regions of the globe. However, it is important to realize that ICT can never be viewed as a panacea or singular solution to the very multifaceted problem of worldwide health. The contributors to global health are very complex, rooted in societal structures, political agendas, and the presence of marked global poverty. Solving one issue without addressing the others will result in the same outcome experienced by Sisyphus; the summit is reached, only to have the boulder roll back down to the base. In particular, efforts to improve health without addressing the pressing problem of poverty will be unsustainable.",

Therefore, while there is acknowledged need for ICT in the coordination and monitoring of treatment, surveillance, response, education, and communication in health care, in reality there are significant barriers in the application of ICT that slow progress. These barriers are in no way restricted to the developing world. The United States and other more technologically advanced nations have their own sets of challenges. Cost, misalignment of incentives, resistance, an unskilled workforce, concerns about impact on productivity, lack of standards and interoperability, and other issues contribute to a poor level of healthcare ICT adoption in the industrialized world. 16 The digital divide has resulted in large segments of low income and/or other underserved groups being excluded from online health resources. 16 Economic hardships and difficult tradeoff decisions in the US healthcare industry have further inhibited healthcare information technology growth. 17 In developing nations, the problem of ICT uptake is even further compounded. A lack of local expertise and decades of well-meaning but non-sustainable ICT projects in the developing world have left a legacy of skepticism in their wake. Systems built for Westernized health care delivery often do not match the local context, resulting in a misalignment between need and technology. Poverty and illiteracy in developing nations stand as major barriers to the adoption and sustainability of information technologies, and many believe it is difficult to make the case for ICT when basic needs for survival are barely being met. 18 The \"e-health paradox,\" a term coined by Liaw and Humphries, refers to this seeming conundrum; populations that may have the most to gain from ICT in health are those who are thwarted in their use due to barriers of untrained personnel, poor infrastructure, and lack of resources. 19 Issues such as these have fueled technological apartheid and continue to subvert the delivery of knowledge to areas of the globe that most desperately need it.",

Dr. Yunus and the telecom company he founded 20 were convinced that economic and social development should begin at the grassroots level. Yunus believed that attacking poverty is essential to peace, that private enterprise is essential to reversing poverty, and that peace and poverty reduction are essential to health. 21 Yunus' microloans enabled destitute village women in Bangladesh to purchase cell phones and become Village Phone Operators (VPOs). The women then sold telecommunication services on a per-call basis to neighbors. This has resulted in considerable wealth generation not only for the VPOs, but for the farmers and village dwellers who are using this technology to access the outside world and improve their businesses. 20 The VPOs provide affordable rates to their neighbors, preventing residents from making (historically, in many locales) a 6-hour roundtrip to reach a telephone, which consequently impacted community productivity and increased community wealth. The VPOs earned enough to invest in their children's health, nutrition, and education, and fund other business growth. The improvement in community wealth translated into improved community health, as funds became available for the drilling of wells for clean water and preventive health services. The VPO model has been rolled out through much of Africa and is viewed by governments and development agencies such as the United Nations, USAID (United States Agency for International Development), and the World Bank as a sustainable development tool. Wealth has impacted health, which is a welcomed consequence.",

For example, \"Sexinfo,\" a SMS-based health information service offered by the San Francisco Department of Public Health, is being used to educate and assist teens who have questions about sexual health. 22 The Centers for Disease Control and Stanford University teamed up recently to hold a conference called \"Texting for Health\" where public health initiatives using SMS were presented. 23 South Africa is using SMS features in cellular telephony to issue reminders to patients and caregivers in hopes of increasing adherence with antiretroviral therapies. Phones for Health, a Presidents Emergency Fund for Aids Relief (PEPFAR)-funded project, is also using mobile telephony to combat HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa. 24 This project allows nurses and other health workers in the field to use a standard mobile phone handset to enter health data. The system uses cellular methods to relay the data to a central database, where it is immediately available to health authorities via the internet. The system also supports the delivery of health alerts and reminder messages to caregivers. 24 Each of these examples illustrates a movement using ICT to enhance information distribution that empowers financial growth, health, and social betterment, in both developed and developing nations. The success of such initiatives opens the door to innovative global ICT methods for enhancing education, public health monitoring and surveillance, and delivery and management of health.

At present, 70% of the nursing workforce in Kenya is comprised of \"enrolled\" nurses, whose level of education leaves them ill-prepared to handle the complex health needs of the Kenyan population. The AMREF's \"Virtual Nursing College\" currently has 4000 nurses enrolled at 100 computer-equipped training centers in 8 provinces, including several refugee camps. The curriculum is delivered via ICT and, in October of 2007, the first class of ICTtrained Kenyan nurses completed the program. 28 While too early to discuss program outcomes, the fact that 70% of all nurses enrolled in this program are from rural areas speaks to a great potential for communities outside of urban centers. This model is planned to be extended to other African nations who are experiencing similar nursing crises. The AMREF program is also important because of an important but less publicized goal-that all 22 000 nurses will be computer literate. This very unique and vital component leaves Kenya ready to lead in the movement towards e-health in the developing world. This could accelerate the achievement of the WHO Resolution WHA58.28, an e-health strategy adopted by the Fifty-eighth World Health Assembly in May 2005 that articulates the preparation of an ICT-competent global health workforce.",

For example, Elder and Clarke cite the following examples for the potential use of cellular telephones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) for telehealth in Africa and Asia: 33 \u2022 Automation of demographic surveillance activities such as those at the core of pioneering health care initiatives (e.g., the Tanzanian Essential Health Interventions Project) \u2022 Testing of the use of SMS (short message service) reminders in the treatment of tuberculosis in Cape Town, South Africa \u2022 Delivery of continuing medical education and professional development via PDA \u2022 Delivery of time-sensitive alerts to patients and health care workers \u2022 Maintenance of patient records for HIV-positive patients' lifelong drug treatments \u2022 Management of specific health care initiatives such as the roll-out of antiretroviral therapy and tuberculosis treatment initiatives Again, realizing the numbers of nurses who are in the frontline of primary care around the globe and in light of the massive growth of ICT for health, tremendous opportunity awaits those who are primed to capitalize upon these factors. Making the application of telehealth/telenursing successful in developing countries will require strong nursing partnerships and leadership, however.

They can be viewed as informal networks that support professional practitioners to develop a shared meaning and engage in knowledge building among members. The theoretical construct of communities of practice is grounded in an anthropological perspective that studies how adults learn through everyday social practices rather than focusing on environments that are intentionally designed to support learning.\"",

Rather than relying on the traditional literature sources for networking and proposal development, this database can provide researchers and others with pre-publication information about existing projects in process. Similar to the CoP concept, the ICN shared database allows the sharing of partnership experiences and results to maximize efficiency and effectiveness. The ICN has also developed a portal called the International Nursing Network to facilitate the exchange of ideas, experience, and expertise for the nursing profession crossing a variety of areas from advanced practice nursing to disaster preparedness. 45 This open access portal serves as a mechanism to encourage global nursing interaction.",

The nursing informatics arena has provided avenues for nurses to serve as leaders, including multiple roles in nursing and through participation in professional organizations. However, nursing informatics, like nursing in general, stands at the edge of a workforce crisis that threatens nursing participation in the rapidly progressing world of ICT. Nursing as a profession cannot leave the progress needed in the face of accelerated global ICT solely in the hands of nurse informaticians. Informatics practice is quickly becoming part of the expected competency of every nurse and, therefore, is becoming not only a responsibility of every nurse, but as an opportunity for every nurse.

Similar to the efforts undertaken by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Commitment to Nursing, 47 it would seem appropriate that major foundations and funding agencies would support the investigation and growth of ICT as a strategy to support frontline nursing care, since nurses are such a vital source for the delivery of health services worldwide. It is also important to emphasize that the agenda for using ICT to advance global health is in no way limited to experts in informatics. Nursing expertise in practice, education, administration, research, and policy are all required to advance this agenda.

Could nurses, long known for their crucial role in patient education, develop ICT-supported solutions to reach patients, their families and caregivers-regardless of geographic location? Can we use ICT to provide lifelines to isolated nurses, midwives and others who are serving their communities? Can we deploy simple ICT solutions to combat the problems of collecting critical individual and population health data in remote locations? Considering that there are more mobile telephones in use in China today than there are people in the United States, 1 what innovative mobile methods could be developed to deliver health messages, answer questions, or collect data? What role might social networking (e.g., wikis, blogs, virtual communities) play in nursing of the future? What shall be the legacy of the current generation of nursing leaders in this rapidly digitizing world?
