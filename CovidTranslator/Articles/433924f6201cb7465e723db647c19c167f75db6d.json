To investigate the role of HIV-1 infection on chemokine regulation, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from normal donors were infected with HIV-1 and the expression of chemokines and their downstream biological functions were evaluated. Among the tested chemokines, CXCL5 was upregulated significantly both at the mRNA and protein level in the HIV-1-infected MDMs compared with mock-infected cultures. Upregulation of CXCL5 in the HIV-1-infected MDMs is, in part, regulated by increased interleukin-1b (IL-1b) production and phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Functional analyses indicate that HIV-1-induced overexpression of CXCL5 has enhanced the ability to attract neutrophils, as observed by chemotaxis assay. However, exposure of NT2, SH-SY5Y cells, and primary neurons to HIV-1-infected MDM supernatants resulted in cell death that was not rescued by anti-CXCL5 antibody suggesting that CXCL5 does not have direct effect on neuronal death. Together, these results suggest that the increased level of CXCL5 in tissue compartments, including the central nervous system of HIV-1-infected individuals might alter the inflammatory response through the infiltration of neutrophils into tissue compartment, thus causing secondary effects on resident cells.",

            "text": "H uman immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection triggers host immune responses by increasing the expression of a number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines both in the periphery as well as in tissue compartments, including the central nervous system (CNS) (Fontaine and others 2011; Letendre and others 2011; Pitha 2011; Nakayama and others 2012) . Chemokines, the chemoattractive cytokines, are one of the major coordinators that regulate the immune response during HIV-1 pathogenesis. These chemokines have dual roles during HIV-1 infection, where they either participate in host defense or contribute toward disease progression. For instance, chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 function as coreceptors for viral entry (Cocchi and others 1995; Bleul and others 1996) , whereas chemokines, including CXCL12, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 restrict the virus entry by binding and blocking viral coreceptors. Although HIV-1 infection disrupts the balance of cytokine/chemokine networks, during the acute phase of infection, chemokines play a crucial role in host defense by modulating other immune cells (Zlotnik and Yoshie 2000) . For example, ELR + chemokines, including CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 contribute to host defense through their involvement in leukocyte migration and activation to tissue compartments. They infiltrate neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes to the site of infection as part of the defense mechanism. Presence of ELR + chemokines is reported in several diseases caused by both viral and nonviral origin. ELR + chemokines have both inflammatory injury and protective effects through their recruitment of neutrophils (Hosking and others 2009; Ichikawa and others 2013) . These chemokines are also known to play a role in breakdown of the blood brain barrier (BBB) (Hosking and others 2009; Marro and others 2012) that would lead to infiltration of leukocytes into the brain from the periphery. However, the effect of ELR + chemokines in HIV-1 CNS disease is not well established.",

Enhanced secretion of CXCL5 by HIV-1infected MDMs did not have any direct effect on neuronal viability; however, it enhanced the neutrophil infiltration as observed in the chemotaxis assay. Together, these results suggest that HIV-1 infection in macrophages/microglia dysregulates chemokines expression through IL-1b and phosphorylation of MAPK kinases that results in the infiltration of neutrophil into tissue compartments.",

Compared with mock-infected controls, HIV-1-infected MDMs differentially expressed a number of chemokines at different time points postinfection (Table 1) . Among the upregulated genes, CXCL5 and CXCL3 showed consistent increase over mock infected throughout the tested time points (fold change ranged from 2 to > 500 for CXCL5 and 2 to > 40 for CXCL3), whereas, CCL23, CXCL6, and CXCL14 showed a modest increase with varying expression levels during early (exposure) and late (replicative) phases of infection. During the replication phase (8-20 days postinfection) CXCL2, CXCL5, and CXCL3 remained at high levels, whereas the other chemokines were either not altered or did not show any consistent dysregulation in HIV-1-infected MDMs compared with mock-infected MDMs. Furthermore, combined analyses, including multiple time points postinfection singled out CXCL5 as the most significant chemokine exhibiting 57.6-fold increase over control with the significance of P = 0.022.

Reporter activity measured posttreatment exhibited a dose-dependent increase in CXCL5 promoter activity by rhIL-1b stimulation compared with no stimulation (Fig. 2D ).

Additionally, a significantly (P = 0.0145) higher level of luciferase gene expression was also observed in these cells treated with HIV-1-infected MDM supernatants compared with mock-infected supernatants, further confirming that IL-1b is, in part, responsible for increased CXCL5 expression.

To determine whether increased CXCL5 level results in increased recruitment of cells, a chemotaxis assay was performed with a CXCR2 (receptor for CXCL5 ligand)-expressing cell line (L1.2 cells) as well as primary neutrophils using HIV-1-or mockinfected MDM supernatants. Multiple concentrations of recombinant CXCL5 (0, 1, or 10 nM) were used as positive control. Results suggest that CXCL5 recruited neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A) . At a concentration of 1 nM rhCXCL5, the number of migrated L1.2 cells was 12 times higher compared with mock. However, at 10 nM there was no additional effect on cell migration, suggesting a threshold limit. Similarly, supernatants from HIV-1-infected MDMs induced higher CXCR2 positive cell migration compared with mock-infected MDM supernatants (Fig. 4A) . We next sought to investigate whether the upregulation of CXCL5 in HIV-1-infected MDMs had differential impact on the migration of primary neutrophils, which also express the CXCR2 receptor. Similar to L1.2 cells, increased migration of human primary neutrophils was also observed in response to increased concentration of CXCL5 in HIV-1-infected culture supernatants compared with mock-infected supernatants (Fig. 4B) . To further confirm the specificity of CXCL5 in neutrophil infiltration, MDMs were preincubated with anti-CXCL5 antibody before HIV-1 or mock infection. Blocking of CXCL5 reduced neutrophil migration by *30% in control MDM supernatants whereas, the reduction was *65% in HIV-1-positive MDM culture supernatants (P = 0.0161) (Fig. 4C) . Collectively, these results indicate that CXCL5 plays a major role in the recruitment of neutrophils and cells expressing CXCR2 receptor.",

            "text": "Although the exact mechanism(s) involved in HIV-1induced CXCL5 upregulation is not fully understood, factors involved at the transcriptional level and signaling pathways are known to modulate the CXCL5 expression in other systems. For instance, IL-1b is known to be regulated by HIV-1 as part of the proinflammatory response both in vivo and in vitro (Devergne and others 1991; Xing and others 2009; Guha and others 2012) . It is also a causative factor for severe inflammatory dysfunction in HIV-1-infected subjects (Mamik and others 2011; Ye and others 2013) promoter (Sun and others 2008) . Our results support the notion that IL-1b regulates CXCL5 at the transcriptional level, as we have noted a direct correlation between IL-1b and CXCL5 production in MDMs infected with HIV-1. Reduced production of CXCL5 by blocking IL-1b and direct activation of CXCL5 promoter-driven luciferase gene by IL-1b further confirms the transcriptional regulation of CXCL5. This observation was further supported by computational analysis that demonstrates the presence of seven NF-kB binding sites in the CXCL5 promoter region that could be potentially regulated by IL-1b. Present data further extend our understanding on the functional consequence of the proinflammatory molecule IL-1b on dysregulation of other chemokines, including CXCL5 in context of HIV-1 infection. Expression of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and immune activation are hallmarks of HIV-1-associated diseases. Although the number of productively infected cells within HIV-1-infected individuals is very limited, the inflammatory response in infected individuals remains high, suggesting an interaction between HIV-1 particles (both infectious and non infectious) and signaling molecules on target and nontarget cell types. This interaction could potentially alter signaling events that trigger the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Although HIV-1 interacts with several signaling molecules, in this study we focused on MAPKs, as these kinases are involved in multiple cellular functions, including activation, proliferation, differentiation, survival, and cytokine/chemokine production (Kyriakis and Avruch 2001) . This is supported by a previous study that indicated that treatment of cells with ERK1/2 and JNK/SAPK inhibitors reduces MCP-1 and MIP-1 production (Kim and others 2006) . We investigated whether HIV-1 infection could alter the phosphorylation of MAPKs such as ERK1/2, p38, or SAPK/JNK that could indirectly modulate CXCL5 production. We observed a similar correlation between CXCL5 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, as blocking of ERK1/2 reduced CXCL5 level in HIV-1-infected macrophages compared with mock-infected control. Our data are consistent with the results shown in hepatocellular carcinoma patients that the overexpression of CXCL5 was associated with ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Zhou and others 2012) . Although how the activation of ERK1/2 is related to CXCL5 production is not established; it is possible to predict that phosphorylation of ERK1/2 could phosphorylate or translocate transcription factors and/or IL-1b that could potentially bind and transactivate the CXCL5 promoter.",

However, the effect of CXCL5 was not evaluated in the context of HIV-1 infection, although several studies suggested the involvement of CCL2 and CXCL10 (van Marle and others 2004; El-Hage and others 2006; Williams and others 2013) in HIV-1-induced neuropathogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that HIV-1-induced CXCL5 does not have any direct effect on neuronal death/survival, as blocking of CXCL5 had no beneficial or adverse effect on neuronal survival. Although the consequence of increased CXCL5 in HIV-1-infected tissue compartment is not well established, secretion of CXCL5 from macrophages in the periphery and CNS could contribute to the infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils to the site of inflammation. It is known that ELR + chemokines contribute to host defense through their involvement in leukocyte migration and activation. Our study and other previous studies have indicated that increased expression of CXCL5 has a direct chemoattracting effect on neutrophils in viral and nonviral diseases such as metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma as well as in hepatitisinfected mice with viral encephalomyelitis (Hosking and others 2009; Zhou and others 2012) . To examine if CXCL5 has a role in infiltrating neutrophils and is not mediated only by the other chemoattractant chemokines, such as IL-8 (Harada and others 1994) , neutralizing antibodies against CXCL5 were used. Our result confirmed that CXCL5 primarily contributes to the movement of neutrophils or CXCR2-positive cells. Contribution of CXCL5 in polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration has also been reported previously in pulmonary mycobacterial infections (Nouailles and others 2014). As HIV-1 infection is associated with immune activation and inflammation, it is possible to predict that the virus may have a role in infiltration of other cell types. The overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b or TNF-a during HIV-1 infection could result in transcriptional activation of CXCL5 in resident macrophages/ microglia that in turn recruits the neutrophils toward the inflamed tissues. Hyperactivation of neutrophils in HIV-1-infected patients is associated with deregulation of the apoptosis/necrosis equilibrium (Campillo-Gimenez and others 2014). Thus, understanding the inflammatory process of HIV-1-infected target cells is an important aspect of HIV-1 biology, especially in the tissue compartments where accumulation of cellular factors remains high. These factors, depending on the amount and its interaction with the surrounding cell types, may result in deleterious effect and tissue damage as observed in brain tissue compartments of HIV-1-infected individuals. Defining the inflammatory networks at the lymphoid and CNS compartment and its downstream effects may provide new avenues for immune therapeutic options to relive the inflammatory burden and its biological consequences.",
